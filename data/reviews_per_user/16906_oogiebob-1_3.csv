3:10 to Yuma," Not one of the great epic Westerns
","This is a re-upholstered version of the original. It has great sets, authentic locations and props. The makeup was overdone on most of the actors except Crowe. The costumes were 'costumey'. The official railroad representative looked like a strolling singer on Main Street in Disneyland.There is plenty in the story and characters to hold interest. But, I didn't like the manner in which one key character was rather unceremoniously eliminated from the story at mid point. The scene truly demanded a bit more theater to it. It left a bit of a hole.Also, one brutal scene involved burning a man alive. (I closed my eyes and covered my ears. I don't like recalling those scenes later.) With a little creativity they could have implied the violence and made that scene more memorable and less graphic. That scene is probably a reason for the 'R' rating. The rest of the 'shoot-em-up' gore is pretty standard.Fans will enjoy Crowe as a smug (underplayed),western outlaw. Overall, the acting is very good (including the hero's son played by young actor Logan Lerman).This film is nowhere near being in the same league as say, 'The Magnificent Seven', 'Legends of the Fall', 'Tombstone', 'Once Upon a Time in the West' etc. This film won't be counted with them.Lastly remember, this is NOT FOR KIDS.",7,2,5,13 January 2008
Superbad," Bad attempt at Teen Party film
","This is a bad imitation of 70's and 80's teen party films. Ironically they used some great tunes from that era as background. In one scene Bill Hader (as police officer) whacks the high school bully in head with baton and makes fun of the bullie's hairstyle saying, 'Nice Mullet,(expletive)!'. The bullie's (long, straight, pony tail) hair style was NOT a 'mullet' (a style Rick Springfield and Lionel Richie made popularin the 80's). Michael Cera, is expressionless, unsexy, can't sing, and lacks energy. How did he get the lead?! Jonah Hill played his role well as did Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the geeky friend. I hear he's like that in real life. This genre goes all the way back to 'American Graffiti' and the 'Porky's' series. This attempt falls flat because of some bad casting and several lame gags and story lines. The whole inept-police-partners schtick is not very funny because Seth Rogan and Bill Hader don't have the physical comedy chops. The film doesn't hold up to an 'American Pie' or a 'rat pack' movie like 'Wierd Science' or 'Pretty in Pink' or 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. This has too much criminality and not enough funny.",3,4,21,2 January 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Fantastic Over the Top Fun!
","ONLY Bruce Willis can pull off this series of films. He is brilliant! He steadfastly keeps his character IN CHARACTER even when the the plot and stunts go crazy over the top. It's hilarious and totally hot cool at the same time. Anything is possible in these flicks. That's what makes them so much fun! Justin Long is fantastic in this too! He goes right along with the formula and plays his role like an expert. Same with Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Timothy Olyphant.Yeah, there were a few editing goofs in some of the action scenes. But, you forget them as the movie keeps up the fast pace. They very expertly apply most of the special effects so there is very little to criticize. And, there are SO MANY great tricks, its a blast!The pace of this film reminds me of Bourne Ultimatim the way it gets straight into the action and keeps moving throughout. This movie has a meaty, sinister plot line. But, it never gets too bogged down with that. It's all fun and games and lots of action. I can hardly wait for the next one.",8,0,1,5 January 2008
