Blade Runner 2049," Too Long and Too I Wish I Were
","It's not bad, it's beautiful, actually.But the main problem is the wish to be something that's no longer available - the original movie at the time it came up.Blade Runner, at the time it was first filmed, had a soul.This new version, which is basically a follow-up, kills everything it was supposed to love, portraying what's no longer there, like a child's memory when revisited years after by the adult that saw it as a child.",6,2,3,23 January 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Do People Know What a Review Is?
","When you see a '10' for this movie, you know there's a lot of blind love there. On the other hand, a '1' is blind hate.A '10' would mean the movie is perfect, which is not - those guys should see a movie without emotion.A '1' means the movie lacks even the very basic production, which it does not - those guys should check on IMDb the lowest rated movies ever - and watch them - to know what a really bad movie really means.The movie fits the bill for the ones expecting the expectable - my case, by the way. I have seen really bad movies, and this is not the case. I've also seen very good movies, and this got close, but not that much.",8,0,0,28 April 2019
Elysium," We have an Earth spoiled buy some guys, and some of us did something about it. There comes a problem, as we all know it.
","It does have something to be questioned about. But then again... It's SCFI... 'Pacific Rim'... kind of basic. I don't thing we need more applause. What we do need is to be asked. And at least 'Elysium' does that. Are you guys willing to be pupped? Are you actually in need to be reaffirmed? That's not my problem, and, then, it does make it your problem, not mine... Ten lines, great. Let's go for it. Although I am Brazilian, it is not about region, it is about an idea. I would question 'Elysium', but I will not. In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make. 'Elysium' is a winner in this quest! If you are to watch 'Pacific Rim', go for 'Elysium'. For us, SCFI's orphan's, is far better enough.",10,7,12,10 March 2014
Alien: Covenant," Nothing Wrong With It, But Public Prejudice
","It's been harder and harder to know what Alien fans want these days. One might think that most of them want to be mesmerized as they were in 1979 with the unbeatable 'Alien', unaware that the times were different then, the element of surprise is now lost and that its narrative formula might be seen as too slow nowadays. On the other hand, there is a public that is still mourning for Ripley e her surviving companions from 'Aliens', dreaming of a nonsensical 'Alien 5' to have their revenge against 'Alien 3'. And, of course, 'Prometheus' fans, who wish to see Shaw and David meet their creators.The point is 'Alien: Covenant' is a good, thrilling film, beautifully filmed, whose characters are captivating and are solemnly missed no matter the screen time they end up having. The bugs, either the traditional xeno or the new introduced neo – and the way they come to life – show how much Sir Ridley is still able to give birth to his creations. I, for one, love his vision, even when less inspired (which is not the case in 'Covenant', plenty of energy and purpose).And, then, the androids, the horrifying absence of what makes us human, and the possibility that this same absence might lead them to what 'real people' have as the worst in their natures.'Covenant' could be better? Of course. It's still a must see though, and aside popcorn and soft drinks, the public should keep fresh eyes to enjoy it as it was meant to be.",9,8,18,23 May 2017
