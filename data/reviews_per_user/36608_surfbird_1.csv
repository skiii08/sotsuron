Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The Miscalculated Effort
","Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace is a seriously miscalculated effort, marred by plodding, lifeless storytelling, dull and annoying characters, and a totally misplaced emphasis on digital effects over substance. It had a few moments of greatness, but a few great moments don't make a great film.Now that Austin Powers 2 has stomped TPM in weekend U.S. box-office receipts, The discussion of the film's merits and flaws can be made with more force. It's apparent that moviegoers are voting with their feet, and have chosen Austin Powers 2 as their favorite-- A film with a narrative structure every bit as incoherent and inconsequential as The Phantom Menace but far more entertaining. Anyone who has observed the markedly different audience reactions of these films knows what I'm talking about.The thing George Lucas miscalculated was his audience base. I think he aimed TPM to a very young audience, leaving his diehard fans and the 18-to-25 moviegoer feeling cheated. It's very telling when fans (or anyone with a good sense for narrative storytelling) suggest changes and improvements to the narrative that are invariably more satisfying that what George has offered. And even then, I personally know a few younger viewers that were bored with the whole affair-- Anakin, Jar-Jar, the Jedi Knights, everything-- after 2 screenings.George had every single reason and resource to make a film that could have been a thoroughly entertaining motion picture-- one that, by rights, should have transcended the bounds of the normal summer-film paradigm and filled every theatre seat all summer long. He had sixteen years, hundreds of millions of dollars, and a wide, loyal fan base that could have spread positive word-of-mouth and seen it over and over again. As far as I'm concerned, he squandered the immense goodwill of the millions of Star Wars fans on a film that could only be unconditionally loved by raving fanatics or the undiscriminating. And, yes I know it's still a huge hit, over $300,000,000 and counting, but that's the unbelievable hype talking.It's instructive to go back and read some of the 1200+ film comments on this film, because every single one of them reflect the universal disappointment anyone who sees TPM feels. Speaking broadly, people react to disappointment two ways: they get bitter or they get defensive. There are lots of bitter, angry, or sad reactions in this collection of comments... this one included.It's an incredible testament to the loyalty of Star Wars fans that many are willing unpaid apologists for Lucasfilm Ltd. You can tell the reactions of an apologist when you read (or hear) the following phrases:' He [George Lucas] is just holding back something for the sequel. I can't wait for Episode 2!'' It's a kid's film-- you shouldn't judge it like a film for grownups.'' No film ever made could live up to the hype this one had.''The thrill Star Wars created in us as children is impossible to recapture.'Without discussing the merits of these arguments, these are the reactions of people just as disappointed as those who were embittered, but instead react with prickly defensiveness. Like I said, as totally dissonant as such reactions are from most people's experience actually seeing The Phantom Menace, you have to admire their loyalty.",3,0,1,15 June 1999
