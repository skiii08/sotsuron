Blade Runner 2049," Just Awful
","After watching this for over an hour, and finding it almost totally incomprehensible, I began to think that it was perhaps a disquisition on the nature of reality. Or a homage to tedium. With several failed attempts to last through to the ending, I had recourse to Wikipedia, and discovered what was supposed to be its plot. It was still incomprehensible. It will be some time, if ever, before I watch this film right through. Faint echoes of Ridley's earlier masterpiece. Since it was photographed by Roger Deakins, the photography had to be skilled. It was just that the scenery and sets were 90% dismal: a kind of grey rust colour, inside and out. The acting was nothing to celebrate. I can't imagine anything less demanding. It was far, far too long, for no reward. I couldn't tell who was real and who was a replicant. Quite a lot of pointless violence, semi-nudity and termination. Was that the message ? How do replicants age ? How do they replicate ? Were they all replicants ? Why did they apparently replicate like humans ? What exactly was this terminally dreary story about ? Don't bother to tell me, I could not care less.",1,4,8,19 June 2018
Vertigo," Ultra bizarre
","Every aspect of this narrative, right from the beginning, bankrupts credulity. Did Scottie fall from the rooftop ? Why is he in a corset ? If he fell, why isn't he as dead as the previous policeman ? Perhaps he is actually dead throughout the film. The scenes with Barbara Bel Geddes are the only natural ones in the whole movie, and she seems like the only genuine human being anywhere around. Moving on to the villainous Gavin Elster's scheme for murdering his wife, this has to be the weirdest plan that was ever devised. One wonders how it was presented in the original book.As the story progresses, and the virtually insane murder plan for exploiting Scottie's vertigo becomes a little clearer, each incident grows progressively more peculiar. Why does Madeleine go into the flower shop from the back door ? Perhaps it's the only place she can park her car. How does she manage to vanish from the hotel ? Is Scottie hallucinating ? If so, why would he be ? Is he being presented as an incorrigible congenital victim ?Moving on to Scottie's sudden recovery from his melancholia, unhelped by Mozart (several weeks ? A year ?), we enter the next phase of this impossible tale - the discovery of Judy from Salina, Kansas. Except for the colour of her hair, she is clearly absolutely identical, down to each eyebrow, with the allegedly deceased ex-Mrs Madelaine Elster, and only a blind man could suppose otherwise.Count me out. I can only think that Hitchcock planned to amuse himself by inducing vertigo in his audience. This is just not a good film. Unrewarding in every way. I identify with Scottie, as a dupe. Perhaps that's what makes it clever, but I still don't know why I've given it 5 stars.",5,5,12,19 February 2019
Black Swan," Distasteful. Unenjoyable.
","Ballet isn't my cup of tea, and never has been. It shapes an unnatural world populated by inhabitants who are aware of little else, and craves their souls as well as their bodies. The ballerinas I have known have been unbelievably ignorant of everything other than dance. It is arguable that the events in this film take place in Nina's mind, and not in reality, a plot resembling Vertigo, or Point Blank. Point Blank was OK, but I didn't go for Vertigo. In Black Swan all the people in the story (other than Nina) --- the ugly cloying mother, the other dancers, the twisted artistic director, are nasty and merciless bullies, mockers, users or exploiters. Nina, as her name suggests, is a challenged nonentity, a sad and innocent ninny, living in stressed and tortured misery. There is a sense in which all that takes place on the screen is a projection of its director's and star's personal anguish and trauma. Those who consider this film to be a masterpiece, or ballet to be the acme of aestheticism, must be reminding themselves that suffering is the price of beauty. The frequency of the scenes with mirrors perhaps indicates the self-reflexive nature of this script.Viewing this film was a distinctly unpleasant experience. The cumulative effect of masturbation, lesbian sex, self-harm, hallucinations, casting couch innuendo, and vomiting down toilet pans made me also want to throw up. It reminded me of the most unpleasant film I've ever seen, namely Irreversible. Picture my surprise when I discovered that Vincent Cassel had been cast as the male lead in both films. Only three stars, because I do not recommend it.",3,2,3,5 March 2017
Spartacus," Kirk's best performance
","Better than I remembered, or was led to expect by the ratings on this site, which have Gladiator at 8.5 and Spartacus at 7.9. It's better written than Gladiator, though not quite as well directed. But fairly accurate historically, as far as can be ascertained. The cast list is very impressive, except for the slightly weird presence of Tony Curtis as a juggler and tone-deaf singer of songs. This actor is, for me, forever indelibly memorable as a cookie full of arsenic, equally incredible as an ex-slave singer of songs as an ex-slave Viking. The rest of the cast is excellent. Olivier is Crassus personified, especially when comparing oysters with snails; Jean Simmons is everything she has to be; Ustinov provides welcome comic relief; Lom is highly convincing; and Laughton is both sardonic and ironic. The biblical echoes are strong. The temporary escape of the slaves powerfully recalls an earlier exodus from Egypt, and the mode of execution favoured by the Romans seems remarkably familiar. There's even a suggested future promise in the appearance of the infant son.",10,1,2,25 July 2018
Chinatown," As perfect as possible
","It's difficult to imagine a more flawless movie than this. A youthful Jack Nicholson is at his very best and most plausible in the role of Jake Gittes, featuring in a continuously engaging story, which can be appreciated as a timelessly sophisticated tribute and homage to Chandler. Each scene and every moment of the swiftly evolving plot is redolent of intrigue and anticipation. Dunaway and Huston are also superbly cast, as are Burt Young, Diane Ladd, Perry Lopez, and the entire list. The acting and direction throughout are uniformly professional and superior. I was particularly struck by the old lady in the retirement home. The script is exceptional, and the dialogue totally polished and realistic. There are one or two lines which are directly evocative of Chandler at his best. For anyone with an IQ above moron level, even if only slightly, it is worth investing a profitable two hours of their life watching this film. It is guaranteed to provide enjoyment and will extend their sensibility and general perception to a very great degree. Audiences expecting a mindless crime thriller will naturally be disappointed, as it is highly intelligent, though ultimately shockingly tragic. The relationship between personal conflicts and the wider ramifications of civic and corporate crime and corruption is unusually subtle. Chinatown is an area of enigmatic impenetrability, which is better left alone. Polanski excels himself. A matter for amazement that this masterpiece languishes as low as 127 on the top 250 list. Some time ago I was discussing movies with a friend's daughter, who is married to a man in the film business. After much thought we mutually decided that Chinatown was probably the best film both of us had ever seen. I just watched it again, for the umpteenth time. This is a wonderful, wonderful film. A clockwork jewel of precision.",10,10,15,24 March 2017
Citizen Kane," Undeniably brilliant
","Kane is a great film: creative, courageous, original, deep and gripping, mentally stimulating, inventive, superbly shot, written, acted. It tells you things about the world and yourself. It is youthful, vigorous and vital. All the actors in Kane are beyond excellent. This film stays with you for the duration.A number of the reviews on this site therefore make incredibly odd reading. It seems to have become the fashion to denigrate this remarkable film, and topple its position on the list, all the way down to number 72. Unbelievable ! Not too long ago a collection of self-appointed arbiters called Sight & Sound critics replaced Kane with Vertigo as their greatest film ever. Stupefying ! Vertigo ! That fantasy that didn't happen ! .The nay-sayers appear to have no sense of history, and be incapable of relating a work to the times it was created in. Not that Kane is dated. In fact, its picture of American power, wealth, politics and corruption was re-enacted yesterday, and is still extant. All that was required was for Kane to shout 'lock him up' when orating against Boss Jim Gettys. In his own words, Kane was an American. He wanted to make his country great, although he was only running for Governor. His life illustrated a profound truism: if you want to be a success, make sure you inherit a fortune; then you can make deals which lose a million a year for 60 years.",10,1,2,24 November 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Ultimately unappreciated.
","Waltz delivers his lines impeccably. Diane Kruger is exceptionally attractive. Hitler, Goebbels, Janning, Bormann, Goering, Churchill are not convincing. The plot is over bananas, frantic and unreal. Zoller and Shosanna both excite unrewarded sympathy, and didn't deserve their fates. The violence is ultimately off-putting. Brad Pitt's accent is also unappealing. Watchable once, but dislikable. Nearly everybody is offed. Standard Tarantino. What exactly is the message ? Revenge is the crime ?",5,0,3,14 September 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," Creepy
","An innocent young girl escapes from a brutal and sadistic military nightmare into a fairy tale kingdom, via death. The road is frightening and unpleasant, and populated by monsters. There seems no point or reason for the tests that she has to pass in order to arrive at the kingdom.This is not an enjoyable movie, but it is effectively told. Children's fairy tales are frequently sad, disturbing and grim. Or Grimm. There's Hansel and Gretel, Little Red Riding Hood, the Pied Piper, the Little Match Girl, and many others. I've come to the conclusion that there is not much benefit to be gained from them. Which is why I cannot recommend this film with any enthusiasm. It's well-made though.",5,0,2,29 March 2017
Alien," Tense; but may I be frank ?
","It drags. The ending is predictable. There are very many plot holes. That agrees with what a large number of reviewers have to say. I'm not alone. Most of the critics have it right, and it is very odd that it sits so high on IMDb. It does not deserve its elevated spot, above numerous much better films. It is dropping, however.Difficult to know how to fill up the requisite ten lines. Ian Holm was good, the way he acted the robot, long before he was revealed to be mechanical. Rather a dodgy feature of the plot, though. Hurt is always good. Sigourney was good in her part. Have I seen her in anything else ? She is supposed to be in Annie Hall, but I didn't notice her. I did also see The Conquest of Paradise, but I can't say I recognized her. The others were run of the mill. They seemed an irritatingly dysfunctional team. One thing about Ridley is that he's supposed to have been impressed by clunky Stanley Kubrick. Strangely enough, I do often think, when I watch a Ridley Scott film, that he is saying: I see what you mean Stan, but let me show you the way to do it. 2001 also drags.",4,3,7,31 August 2016
Fargo," Minnesota gets nailed and shredded
","Having seen this film some years ago I used to think it was really good. I watched it again last night, and decided it was actually pretty messy and nasty. Nearly all the characters, with Marge and the bit parts excepted, are unusually unpleasant. The Coens seem not to have enjoyed growing up in Scandinavian America, and have taken revenge on the place. Is it populated almost entirely by dolts, scammers, thugs, bullies, hookers, wimps and so on ? According to the extra feature 'Minnesota Nice' there is an underlying feeling that 'polite cultures are the most repressed and therefore the most violent'. The Coens put it that way, in any case. In other respects the whole set-up reminded me a little of Blue Velvet country, ten years earlier.The film kicks off with three unplanned killings of innocent people, and then adds to these with three or four more. It would spoil things were I to list them. Marge, who is a pregnant policewoman, then forces a solution to what is going on and arrests the surviving guilty party. She tells him it's a beautiful day. It isn't in fact, since it's foggy and snowy. She ends up in bed with her signally lumpy husband, and tells him he's wonderful. The two of them spend a lot of time stuffing their mouths. There is a curious incident with a mentally disturbed Japanese man. I don't quite know what that's about. The net result is faintly comic, in an ugly sort of way, if you think all the deaths are funny. $1 million, less $80,000, is buried and lost in the snow.",7,0,0,8 June 2018
Burn After Reading," Slightly funnier than I thought
","Now that I've watched at least ten Coen films, and seen them at least twice each, I feel inclined to draw conclusions about the oeuvre. A friend of mine in the film business told me that it's the director who makes the film. The actor may sell the film, since people often just want to see him/her. But the ultimate merit of a film depends on the writer. This is where the Coens may be lacking. Their scripts are said to be extremely well-prepared before shooting. But that doesn't necessarily mean they contain any substance. Coen films can give an impression of having been thrown together in the form of several episodic cameos, compelling or amusing, but somehow lacking unity. This is the case with BUR, I feel, and may account for those reviewers who express their dissatisfaction with it. I would say the Coens' most solid and impressive production is No Country for Old Men, and that may be because it is based directly on someone else's book. It seems to mean something. The Coen remakes are not good, and one wonders why they were made.. The trouble with something like Burn After Reading, is that it seems ultimately pointless, although it is funny in parts. There is a tendency in many of these films for people to croak. Death is a joke. Perhaps most comedy lacks substance. Burn after Reading is a makeshift title.",6,0,2,14 June 2018
The Bourne Identity," Action, Action
","And more Action. Acting and direction more than competent. Continuous. Pursuit and escape. Judo, ju-jitsu, karate, kung-fu, what have you. Spectacular international travelogues. Interminable car chases. Bond re-bourne, but with a different objective. In a sense, a less sophisticated counter-Bond, who turns in his license to kill. Not too easy to follow the plot, but it eventually becomes clear that the bad guys are part of our side. Enjoyable. Good stuff. Not to be taken seriously, in spite of the several deaths. The three discs in the trilogy hang together. The same review does for all three: Supremacy and Ultimatum.",8,1,1,10 June 2017
The Caine Mutiny," No mutiny here
","If you are in the navy and your terminally stressed-out captain, during a typhoon, alternates between paralysis and giving lunatic orders calculated to make the ship highly liable to founder, do you not relieve him of his command ? What else could you possibly do ? Drown along with the rest of the crew ? Perhaps there would still be a court-martial.Most reviewers seem to be in two minds about this movie. Virtually all are agreed that the romance is completely irrelevant, and belongs somewhere else, if anywhere. Most consider it otherwise well-acted, at least by Bogart, MacMurray and Van Johnson. Most consider the end scene with Jose Ferrer turning up drunk and jingoistic to be embarrassing. For some reason it nevertheless seems kind of interesting and memorable. I remember my mother talking about it in 1955. It's dated, and yet it isn't, and still seems strangely effective.",7,3,4,18 November 2017
Armageddon," Above, beneath, beyond criticism
","There is entirely no point in listing the plausibility holes in this production. One might as well protest the impossibility of Superman defying gravity, or wearing his red underpants over his blue tights. This film is obviously not about the technicalities of travelling the solar system, astronaut training, the practical applications of nuclear power, intercultural fraternisation in outer space, or similar topics.Instead, it seems to be about team spirit, meeting challenges, family values, doing the right thing, handing the torch on down the generations, self-sacrifice, and the built-in dumbness of corporate suits. Corny and as old-fashioned as anyone might wish, but I found it entertaining, and even enjoyable. I've seen Billy Bob in a number of films now and find it curious how he manages to be different, yet the same, in all of them. Interesting to note which members of the squad were disposable.",7,1,3,20 January 2017
Cross of Iron," War: Sustained Chaos and Confusion
","Resembles an Impressionist or Modernist painting, as, for instance, Guernica. Each sub-theme plays its part, but is not followed through in the overall narrative. The whole is greater than the sum of these parts. Those reviewers who find the film to be a total mess are the usual obtuse and insensitive dunces that made up the studio suits who dumbly did their best to wreck Peckinpah's creations. Moreover, several of those retards seem to think this film is about Nazis: in fact, there is not a solitary Nazi in the entire movie. (Well, there may be one). These men are hapless apolitical soldiers, even the pompous self-promoting and dishonourable Prussian. Also, the Iron Cross is not remotely the equivalent of the American Purple Heart. The Iron Cross was awarded for bravery in battle as well as other military contributions in a battlefield environment. The Purple Heart is awarded for a broken nose, provided a bona fide enemy delivered the punch; or a flesh-wound in the bum, when running away. The film's story plays out as a series of interlocking and merged, but individual and self-contained, episodes. For instance, the early episode of the ironic tragedy of the little Russian boy, taken prisoner and then shot by his own side, is one of these episodes. His harmonica can be taken as a lucky charm, which saved his life when captured, and which he gives to Steiner, thereby surrendering his good luck to the German Sergeant, who survives to the bitter end.The battle scenes are intensely striking. The combatants are difficult to tell apart, and that figures, since there's little essential difference between them. They might as well be on either side. The tanks are faceless, anonymous, death-dealing robots, indiscriminately destroying anything in their path, human or inanimate.Another very effective and affecting episode is Steiner's hallucinatory and romantic spell in the hospital. This recalled the fate of those wounded British soldiers in World War I, who returned to the front when recovered but undaunted, to carry on and die regardless. The nurse is resigned to the soldier's decision. No genuine frontline soldier is concerned in the slightest with the rights and wrongs of the conflict, but, as the film notes, merely with staying alive and supporting his comrades. Captain Stransky, with his questionable un-Germanic name, loses sight of that ethic because of his unnatural desire for the bravery cross; but he maybe sees enough light towards the end to shelve this attitude.This is, obviously, a remarkably fine film. The only reason I'm docking one star is because it seems wrong to have all the good Germans played by American and British actors, and the dodgy German played by a German. Also, the dirty, long-haired, unshaven David Warner doesn't appear to be German at all.",9,1,3,15 December 2016
The Dirty Dozen," Scum of the earth
","Wellington's famous remark about his soldiers would seem to apply to the dirty dozen, but the only really unpleasant member of the team was the religious misogyny maniac played by Telly Savalas. The rest seemed fairly normal, just like ordinary everyday criminals. Presumably the military has always offered refuge to the unfortunate detritus of humanity. It has often licked the scum into shape. In Britain, they used to be sent to sea.This is not an easy movie to review, nevertheless. The direction is skilled, the acting totally competent, if not especially demanding. The narrative is gripping, although there are a few disconcerting jump cuts. Lee Marvin holds it all together with exemplary swashbuckling style. However, and several reviewers have pointed this out, there is something highly distasteful about the way the final half hour spins to its ruthless conclusion. Was this some form of retribution for the Holocaust ? Realistic perhaps, but I have to dock a few stars.",6,3,7,12 November 2018
No Country for Old Men," Marvellous Ending
","The message of this film is that there is no symmetry to life. What goes around does not come around. The fall of the coin has no bearing on the way the cookie crumbles. There is no right or wrong to the fates of men. No justice. Opportunities seized may lead on to fortune, but they could just as well lead on to dusty death. Only children expect things to be fair. As things once were they need no longer be. Now that IMDb has decided to list reviews by date there is a slightly increased possibility that this effort will be read by someone. Performance reviews are absolutely not read by me for helpfulness, but for interest and entertainment.",10,442,491,1 March 2018
Mamma Mia!," ABnormal
","A reviewer has pointed out that previous musicals composed music and songs to fit a story. Here, however, the story has been invented to fit the songs already created. The result, if you are bothered by it, is odd; but who cares ? Who gives a dam ? The only tragedy is that the story doesn't include the As from ABBA. So does it matter if some of the stars can't sing ? Read instead the legion of comments on you tube about: 'the Mozart of popular music'. ABBA are unique, the greatest pop group that has ever existed, or ever will. Forget the rest, and everyone following Halley's Comet, like the little sissies and the revolving rocks. Sadly, on this site there are a number of mentally impaired, tone deaf, and denigrating wet blankets, who may safely be ignored, but who have managed to lower the vote. I admit that I was greatly surprised to see Harry (Colin Firth) transformed into a dancing quean. Especially since one of the great attractions of ABBA is that they are everyday straight, normal, untattooed, unrebellious, totally social, totally human.",10,0,3,2 June 2020
JFK," Stimulating.
","According to Wikipedia, in 1979 the United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was assassinated probably as a result of a conspiracy. I agree with this probability, and this film helps to persuade me. I am also persuaded that Gary Oldman is the greatest actor in film history.",9,0,0,6 October 2019
The Man Who Would Be King," Huston's homage to Kipling's denigrated greatness
","On 21 September 2019 a British politician was recorded as choosing Kipling's 'Kim' as one of his favourite books. At the same time he stated that Kipling was a racist and an imperialist. That is an opinion held by many intellectually challenged and stunted people, who have otherwise not read or understood his works. Conversely, T.S.Eliot wrote in 1941 'I cannot find any justification for the charge that Kipling held a doctrine of race superiority.' Eliot found instead, 'An immense gift for using words, an amazing curiosity and power of observation with his mind and with all his senses, the mask of the entertainer, and beyond that a queer gift of second sight, of transmitting messages from elsewhere, a gift so disconcerting, when we are made aware of it, that thenceforth we are never sure when it is not present: All this makes Kipling a writer impossible wholly to understand and quite impossible to belittle.' That is shown in this film. Another author who considered Kipling to be a great and incomparable poet was Jorge Luis Borges. A nauseating and inexplicably repellent view of Kipling's work was penned in 1942 by George Orwell, otherwise a distinguished, if plagiaristic, novelist. Huston's memorably masterful film can be considered a metaphor for the rise and fall of the British Empire, as observed and objectively recorded by its literary genius. The Empire was not founded by little men; but high and mighty pride precedes a fall. Some of the low-star reviews on this site are unbelievably inane.",10,0,2,28 September 2019
The Insider," Overwrought, overworked, moody, complicated, confusing
","There are basically two interlinked stories here. One is about Mike Wallace a charismatic television personality, who caved in to corporate power. The other is the story of Jeff Wigand, a bumbling character who was persuaded to take on a company I'd never heard of called Brown & Williamson, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco. He eventually succeeded in changing the public's perceptions of the effects of smoking. Although the public may have been quite aware of those effects already. Crowe looks a bit like Wigand, and Plummer looks quite like Wallace. Pacino, who played the persuader, Lowell Bergman, a reporter, doesn't look like him. It seems that Crowe spent a lot of time with Wigand so that he could imitate him in the film. Bergman has said that the film was emotionally, politically and, in general, dead-on accurate. He terminally fell out with Wallace.Wallace is said to have hated this portrayal of him. But the force of corporate power is a given. Not many are as resolute as, say, Thomas More. It's an extremely unusual man who stands up to corporate pressure.However, the question I was left asking myself was: How addictive is nicotine, and: is it the nicotine which harms the body, or is it the smoke of the tobacco leaves ? I used to be a fairly heavy smoker – 30 or 35 cigarettes a day; but gave up on 16 November 2010 and have only smoked about 15 cigarettes since, after finding them lying around the house. I think it's more of a habit than an addiction. The film is too long.",6,0,1,23 September 2017
Annie Hall," Two remembered scenes
","One is when Marshall McLuhan makes a personal appearance. No memory of what he said. I saw this film several years ago, but could only remember this scene, and when Woody turns into a Rabbi at the Hall family dinner table. The jokes come thick and fast, but they are not really very funny. American one-liners. They don't travel well; and some are quite old and re-cycled anyway.It's highly self-referential. Embarrassingly self-pitying, I fear. There isn't a lot different between this Woody, and the unfunny comic he makes fun of. He used to write jokes for other comedians, and I suppose that episode reminded him of the tedious, unrewarding business. What he's doing here is putting us, the audience, in the place of the psychotherapist, and then stretching out on a cinematic couch and telling us all his problems. In fact, that's what he says in the opening scene, when he addresses the viewer directly. But are his problems of more than passing interest to the world ? Reminds me of Two-Way Blacktop, where the hitch-hiker says he doesn't want to know about GTO's history.Still, I did watch it all the way through. Perhaps I was waiting for it to improve. But it didn't. Critics have called it dated, although I don't associate it with any particular date. Other Woody Allen films that I've seen are streaks better. The Purple Rose of Cairo is a very good, inventive, moving example.",5,1,2,5 September 2016
La La Land," Nostalgia for LA days gone
","Faded memories of Old Hollywood. Definitely faded. A touch of Busby Berkeley, a little Fred and Ginger, but fundamentally indebted to Casablanca. On first viewing, not having seen her before, what struck me most were the uniquely fluid and malleable features of Emma Stone. Perhaps it was the soupcon of Bergman blood in her veins. Otherwise, although the plot began to grip a little towards the end, it did not seem impressive. Six Oscars, seven Golden Globes ? On second viewing, it gathered pace. After all, as Rick once said 'We'll always have Paris'. There was something filmically and musically French about it.",8,0,2,20 January 2018
Reservoir Dogs," Terminal bodycount
","Exceedingly difficult flick to review. Very difficult to watch twice, knowing the plot, which is anyway rather obvious in a way. I've been reading the one-star reviews, but I don't agree with them. All drama is influenced by somebody else's earlier work. This is very well-written, witty and inventive. Could be acted on a stage. It reminded me of Oscar Wilde. It is also extremely well-acted by all concerned. The Tarantino trademark is the depiction of criminals as just like everybody else, with the same sort of conversation and preoccupations, outside the lawlessness and obscenity. What do they call hamburgers in France ? Interesting point. I wouldn't want to be called Mr Pink. I have to admit that the violence is off-putting, after it's been experienced once. Glad to have seen this film, but can't really positively recommend it, although I give it a fairly high mark. Don't understand the title. Reservoir ?",8,0,1,1 September 2018
Some Like It Hot," Everybody's perfect here.
","One question, which can be very simply answered, is why this production is so astronomically better than the slightly disappointing lesser Wilder flicks I've been watching recently.The one-word answer is: pace. This film is on the run all the way through, from the Valentine's Day Massacre, to Marilyn biking down the steps to the jetty, and it never lets up. It is gripping all the way, with not a single longueur. But there are other reasons. It's brilliantly scripted, and the dialogue is matchless. The gender-bending is wholly undisturbing and somehow actually tasteful. Curtis as a shady Cary Grant is unforgettable. Sweet Sue and Beanstalk are made for each other. Another reviewer points out that George Raft wasn't told he was in a comedy. Joe E Brown's one-note is pitch-perfect. But the real reason for this film's perfection is Marilyn. Her neuroses are legendary, her unreliability iconic. She kissed like Hitler, and needed 30 takes for every line. These, and her visibly stunning starriness, must have spurred the rest of the cast and the director on to reaching even greater heights. Wilder did make some great films, but this is the hottest. For all to like.",10,1,1,18 April 2019

The Fountain," Glad to have had it explained
","Unprepared in every way for this movie, I hadn't the faintest idea what was going on for about the first four-fifths of it. Towards the very end it became a little clearer. Reading the other reviews has explained it, more or less. But even knowing what it was meant to be about, I don't think I'll be revisiting it again. Not in the foreseeable future anyway. Jackman and Weisz both seemed to be trying hard, as did the rest of the cast, so presumably the fault lies with the script and direction. Perhaps the basic idea had possible potential. It needed a considerable number of revisions, to make it user-friendly, and I gather it had already had a few, but more were needed.It was evidently a film with a message, and the message was 'Death Is the Road to Awe'. Helpful for those worried about their way to death, and a message which has been used for millennia. Wordsworth put it differently: 'Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting'. You could say the same about death. Death being another form of birth. A sleep and a forgetting. Open up them pearly gates.",4,0,2,3 March 2017
The Departed," Huh ?
","After sitting through this lengthy story I came to its end with the realisation that I had hardly understood anything of what had been going on. I was also quite sickened, and gravely puzzled, and more or less bored senseless. Since the film had collected 8.5 points on this site, I felt I must be going senile, and that my next stop would be the funny farm. Fortunately, I then decided to check whether there had been any low star reviews, and was delighted to find that there had indeed been a very large number of reviewers who had nothing whatsoever good to say about this film. I'm with them. Perhaps it's because I'm a committed un-Catholic.",1,0,0,7 May 2020
Ray," Memorable songs, but that's about it
","As presented in this biopic, Ray had a personality that fell well short of merit and likability; even after making allowance for the short straws he was handed from childhood. Some people's character is improved by suffering. Evidently not Ray's. Another reviewer describes him as a drug using, cheating, greedy man who happened to have a great voice. There's obviously more to it, but on balance the picture presented here is not exactly pretty. It is possible, perhaps, that Ray was punishing himself, or suffering from a perverse kind of guilt, for not having saved his little brother from drowning. Perhaps he felt he'd paid for it by going blind. Who can tell ? In any biography the truth gets lost in the past and the re-telling, like tears in rain. I'm not inclined to re-watch this account. The actor did a good job.",6,1,4,5 December 2017
The Queen," Not quite as good as I first thought.
","Cunningly put together: real footage spliced with suppositional fictional dialogue and events. Mirren and Cromwell are exceedingly well cast, and convincing, if slightly one-dimensional. It's the way the parts are conceived and written. But Charles, Blair, Cherie, Alistair and Queen Mum, unfortunately come across as little more than cartoon caricatures. This is the problem with the movie as a whole: it seems rather shallow and superficial, as if its subject were really Diana, and not the Queen.Stephen Frears is nevertheless a subtle, multi-layered director. His early production, 'The Hit', is a masterful example. This film, like that one, is certainly memorable, and has a trick of making you reflect and think about the implications of the events taking place. There would appear to be a distinct advantage of having a hereditary figurehead, in effect a President, with no political power, who is brought up and trained to behave in a responsible, representative manner. This is not a position suitably occupied by a ditzy celebrity type of bimbo, going all out to court popular publicity. The alternative to the tradition evolved in the UK over the last thousand years is currently transpiring across the pond. An amusing and telling remark was made, to the effect that Blair's charisma might possibly also one day evaporate.",7,0,0,11 December 2016
Raging Bull," A Martin Scorsese Picture
","After watching the interviews on the special features disc I understood that I had to upgrade my rating for this film, from six stars to nine. In particular, the views of Oscar-winning Thelma Schoonmaker were decisive. Her words, as also those of the other interviewees, were exceptionally positive and persuasive. However, I still don't much like the picture. It is noted on the internet that much of Scorsese's work addresses Sicilian-American identity, and Roman Catholic concepts of guilt, faith and redemption. His films also deal with machismo, misogyny, crime and gang conflict. Many of them are notable for their depictions of violence and liberal use of obscenity. In general, I find these topics, the vicious atmospheres and anti-ethical climate they generate, to be off-putting and negative. The after-taste is unpleasant. Sin, murder, steal as much as you've a mind to, just confess and Heaven will smile. As long as there's a crucifix above your bed. These values don't appeal. The story of Jake La Motta is remarkable, but not inspiring.In spite of this, or because of it, Scorsese extracts uniformly great performances from his actors. De Niro was outstanding, not only for his extra 60 pounds; and Pesci and Moriarty were up with him, in the vividly lived-in reality of their roles.Some comment on the movie's subject, Mr La Motta, seems necessary. As of this review, this man was still amazingly alive and well, aged 95. Now he has died. He is reported to have had the greatest chin in boxing history. Considering the treatment it endured, his body must have been encased in hardened leather, and his head constructed of concrete. In the extra features interview he was highly lucid, and unrepentant.",9,3,5,16 January 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," The Dark Night Descends
","This elongated chaotic murk is studded with stars, but they shed no light. I could tell there was a bad guy, but I couldn't figure out how he managed to breathe. The good guy seemed to be the Batman, but he was too willowy and wispy, and during his frequent bouts of fisticuffs with the bad guy he always got the worst of it. At one point I thought the plot was vaguely modelled on the French Revolution and the Reign of Terror. But only vaguely. It would possibly have been helpful to know how the several other stars had been designed to fit in to this benighted epic. I think we should have been told. But I couldn't make it out. My fault, no doubt. After a few hours of bafflement, the scene was suddenly flooded with light, and civilization was saved. The question remained: Had it been worth it ? Not really. This film, bought on a mistaken whim thinking it came in at number 4 on the all-time list, has firmly warned me off any others featuring the legendary Batman. Give me Dracula, any day.",2,2,3,22 April 2018
Blade Runner," Miraculous masterpiece: great
","Several years ago I may have read the original story, but don't remember it; and it doesn't matter. The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.Now that I've read the book, and watched 'Dangerous Days', I learn that Tyrell, the supposed creator, was merely another replicant, which simply confirms what I already believed.",10,7,12,9 September 2017
Amélie," French. Difficult not to like
","Several viciously voluble critics in the hated-it section. That's the section I usually read first. I see where they are coming from, up to a point, and what they object to. Not deep, because it's unreal, but I like it anyway, because it's different, ingenious, surprising, original. Touching, in a way. Also Audrey's appearance, personality, face and figure are unique. She is also unreal. That smile ! Those eyes ! And the colouring !It won Best Film at the European Film Awards. It won four César Awards (including Best Film and Best Director), two BAFTA Awards (including Best Original Screenplay), and was nominated for five Academy Awards. It grossed over $33 million in limited theatrical release, the highest- grossing French-language film released in the United States. It took over £105 million around the world. The Wiki information provided about Audrey Tautou seems to parallel the background of Amelie. Audrey's father was a dental surgeon, and her mother was a teacher. Amelie's father was a doctor, and her mother was a teacher. Audrey also looks as though she has boyfriend trouble.I could think up reasons for knocking this film, but I'm not inclined to argue against its success, or its 8.4 popularity. Tautou treats cinematic celebrity with the indifference it deserves.",9,0,1,6 September 2016
Rear Window," Full-frontal Window
","One reviewer has pointed out that anyone who wanted to spy on his neighbours would surely prevent them from spying back on him. In fact everyone in this courtyard seems to perform in full exposure --- although there are one or two occasional exceptions. It is explained it is because the weather was very hot.The fan-like structure of this movie is creative. The central theme, played out between Stewart and Kelly, concerns the relationship between the sexes. Every playlet observed through the window, offers an ingenious courtyard commentary on the variety of these relationships, from celibate solitude, via frantic partying, through loneliness, newly-weds and long-term marriage, to marital murder. The little dog seems to take the place of a kid; kids being otherwise relegated to the half-seen street at the back.The dog, and its fate, is one of the two mysteries in the plot. What was the point of killing the little dog ? Why did murderer Burr bury something in a flower-bed ? What was it ? Did I miss something ? Seems completely pointless. He got rid of everything else by other means, simply enough. The other mystery which no-one seems to mention, concerns the curious black-clad female figure at one point seen emerging with Burr from his flat. Who was that ? Did I miss something ? Brilliant film, though. I like Grace Kelly. She is civilised because she says either, not eether.",10,2,3,17 March 2019
300," Killing
","Butler and Headey are both terrific in this movie, and so are the rest of the cast. Butler's tough Scots accent fits perfectly into the personality of Leonidas, the Spartan head honcho, especially when he voices his contempt for the Athenian boy lovers, and lets the messenger know 'This is Sparta' . Another reviewer tells me that this is a great make for a Frank Miller comic. The fact is that these events may be violent, unethical and wrong, but they are also comical. I couldn't help laughing. Especially when Xerxes descends from his throne.",10,1,2,18 July 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," No
","Not funny. Tedious. Boring. Fast forward. Flat. Lame. Mentally bankrupt. Struggling. Uninventive. Would be laughable if it wasn't soporific. How can I manage a minimum of five lines for this disaster ? Please help me. Void of wit, novelty and ideas. Laboured. Painful. There are many other things to do besides watching this. I couldn't face it all the way. It was not just silly, but stupid silly. I seriously (and I mean this very sincerely) hope I will lose a lot of votes with this uniquely perceptive review. End.",1,7,22,15 July 2017
Saboteur," Decent set-up, dodgy development.
","Starts quite well, but grows increasingly muddled and unconvincing the longer you keep watching the incidents pile up. Bosley Crowther noted that 'there is no logic in this wild-goose chase.' Echoes 39 Steps and looks forward to North by North West. What is interesting in retrospect is the suggestion that there might have been, or actually were, a high proportion of high profile Nazi sympathisers in America, prior to Pearl Harbour and Hitler's declaration of war. It is tempting to list the top half dozen, but I'll only mention Henry Ford and Ezra Pound. In the film characters such as those are represented by the wealthy and witty Mr Tobin, and the even wealthier charitable Mrs Sutton. One reviewer mentions the strange reluctance of the bad guys to terminate the hero, Barry Kane, a good citizen and non-saboteur, when he's in their power. In fact, it's a little difficult to work out who is on which side as the story progresses. The real star of this film is Baby Susie Brown, who steals the show as far as I'm concerned.",7,0,1,21 February 2019
True Romance," Ten Hundred Per Cent
","This movie is flawless. It is also without blemish. It is not possible to think of any way in which it might be improved. Not a lot of films you could say that about. The entertainment value, and the pleasure quotient, rise with each revisit. The narrative consists of a linear series of cameos, or vignettes, strung together like a string of pearls on the tracks of a romantic duo. Arquette and Slater are pitch-poised perfect in these parts: they are both picaresque and picturesque, and will doubtless never shine again with comparable luminosity. Oldman, though dead as Drexl, is immortal.",10,0,1,4 June 2020
Gladiator," Ridley sure can direct
","Re-watching this after several years has caused me to revise my rating upwards. I must have been over-influenced by reading the silly one-star reviews. This is an inventive and fictional tale, set in imperial Rome, with one or two actual historical characters. Unlike phony Braveheart, it in no way sets out to distort actual history. It is exceptionally skilfully directed, and the narrative never lets up. Ridley seems always to get the best from his actors. One of the least boring epics I've ever watched. Ridley Scott can turn his hand to any genre. Miles ahead of Kubrick: it's as if he is saying: I see what you're at, Stan, let me show you how to do it. Sometimes it steers dangerously close to excessive emotion, but time and again avoids bathos. Excellent script and dialogue. Visually masterful. Great movie.",10,0,0,23 July 2018
V for Vendetta," Vapidity squared.
","Provides me with the unique opportunity of writing a review for a film I haven't seen. Took me some time to get my DVD player to accept it. When it did, I had to turn it off after ten minutes because it seemed so idiotic and abominably atrocious. Just to make sure, I read the multiple one-star reviews in the hated it section on this site. My impression was duly and doubly confirmed, hands down.Poor Natalie, after Leon. Poor John Hurt, got up to look like a sort of raving Hitler, after the original Orwell film, and many other fine performances. Sucks to the rest, especially Fry, the world's most unappealing cinematic presence. The reviews, the writing and the remaining actors all turned me permanently off.The first Matrix film was definitely good. Since then, the Wachowski Brothers, Lilly and Lana, have plunged downhill with ever-increasing speed. The vote of 8.2 for this effort on IMDb is stupefying. Presumably, they will still continue to churn out the same sort of meaningless emptiness. Even the movie's title is completely without significance. It looks as though this is the way most movies are heading",1,3,8,30 August 2016
