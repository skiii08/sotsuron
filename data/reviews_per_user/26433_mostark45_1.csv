The Hangover," too much foul language and sexual innuendos
","I thought this was a decent movie, and I do like Zach (whatever his last name is), normally. He doesn't have to be foul to be funny. Why do so many movies have so much foul language and such. Hey, I don't mind a little, to be realistic. In my opinion, many of the movies would be just as funny, if not more so, without so much of it. It's like, they throw the 'F' word just for a few more laughs. Has the opposite effect on me. The scenes with the baby were not necessary. I think it would have been funnier if they had tried NOT to say so many! (As in a few scenes). As for the plot line, I enjoyed it. It did have me wondering what was going to happen next. Also, as in previous posts, the Asian guy was a bit over the top. I was not overly impressed with this movie, the previews made it look funnier than it actually was. I have no intention of watching it again.",5,0,4,22 July 2009
