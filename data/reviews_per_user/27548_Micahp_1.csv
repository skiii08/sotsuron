The Blair Witch Project," I have mixed feelings about this movie.
","No one can argue that the Blair Witch Project was a failure from a marketing standpoint.  Everyone in the world has heard the stories about the costs and the revenues.  In that respect, it was an unquestionable success.As far as the movie goes...Well that is another story.You all know the story, it's been hashed through and through. I'll skip all that and go straight to the review. This movie has scary moments, unfortunatly they were only in the last twenty minutes or so. Does the rest of the movie keep your interest? Yes and no. This movie has a 'real' aspect to it, the problem is that real life is mundane. Most people go to films to escape reality, and when they are faced with mundane reality (people looking at twigs and going 'boo!', it can get dull for some. I, however, found it interesting in a 'Real World' voyer kind of way. Then when the characters do things that would never, ever happen in real-life (i.e. what happens to the map). That just wrenches you out of the story and completely kills your suspension of disbelief, you realize that you've been watching a movie for the last 45 minutes and nothing at all has happened. The bottom line is, this movie was hyped...bad. Nothing could live up to the expectations people had. The only thing that could possibly save this movie for people just now seeing it, is if you could somehow forget the past few months of commercials, emails, and testimonials; and just watch an interesting little experiment from a couple of young, talented filmakers.",Null,0,1,2 November 1999
