The Blair Witch Project," Interesting....
","I must say that I was quite dissappointed with this film. After all the hype surrounding it I found the movie quite mediocre.I am impressed with the fact that the directors tried to make it a 'proper' horror film, in that they used no special effects. The documentary style was indeed good. I liked the random movements of the camera especially. Makes it all seem confusing and 'lost' even though Heather would have you believe otherwise.Now to the low points. Sound could have been better. In the scenes where they used the footsteps, child screaming, and Josh screaming outside the tents... well... I had to turn the volume up quite a bit to realise what all the fuss was about. And while all these whimpering noises, piles of rocks and bundles of sticks may have scared the actors... I must say that I found this film totally unscary. It was also very very slow in parts.And the ending was so disappointing. I felt like I'd just run an enormous marathon and been placed last.",Null,0,1,1 May 2000
