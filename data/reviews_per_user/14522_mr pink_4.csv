Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," exciting, reminscent of episode 4, yet some stuff's not very cool
","phantom menace was fast paced and exciting...it was very enjoyable.  i know very little about the saga but it seemed to me a lot of time was used as basically set up for the next two films, just like i believe episode 4 does for 5 and 6.  jar jar binks and his people are slightly more cool than the ewoks, but they still are not very cool and a little annoying.  some creature(jar jar) seem too cute.  the effects are cool, but some of the plot is a little predictable.",9,0,0,20 May 1999
Alien," CUT!
","CUT! This is something Mr. Scott should learn to say every once in awhile. This could have been a great film, it does have a decent story, unfortunately the director was just to incompetent to make this a good flick. Had there been more editing and fewer ungodly long takes it would become a much more enjoyable watch.",2,5,37,6 September 2002
Zulu," It's like the energizer bunny!
","This film was not as terrible as it could have been. However, it was also not as good as it should have been. It is a great story of triumph of an African civilization against the British Empire. However, the movie drags on and on and on and on...well you get the picture. While not a total waste of time it is not advisable to watch this film if you wish to be entertained, but if you just wish to see a nearly forgotten piece of history this is a decent flick.",1,8,66,6 September 2002
Empire Records," damn the man
","Empire Records is very 80's but for the 90's.  Great cast, great script, well directed and entertaining.  Not to be taken seriously but to be enjoyed.  It gives hope to me in a strange way that even though everything around you sucks that you have the power to change it...all it takes is fate.  The reason that this movie is so great is that its characters are all of us,(very reminiscent of Breakfast Club) you have to identify with at least one if not all of the characters in some asspect.  Also superb soundtrack. Damn the man save the empire!!!!",9,0,0,28 September 1998
