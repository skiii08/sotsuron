The Devil's Advocate," Most ridiculous plot I have ever seen
","This has got to be the most ludicrous plot line ever.  Keanu Reeves' long lost dad just happens to be the devil.  Yeah, right!  How can it be a thriller when its not even faintly believable?  I could only sit it out because Keanu looked quite nice dressed up in his suit.  No suspense, no tension, just 'what the hell is this all about'.  Don't bother with it.",Null,0,1,10 July 2001
