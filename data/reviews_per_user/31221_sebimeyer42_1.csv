Requiem for a Dream," So honest it is almost too much
","There are certain things that are so cruel, touching, honest or all of these at the same time that you almost cannot bear to watch it.This movie is one of these things. The movie follows the problems and fall of 4 characters. It does not offer any flashy messages like 'do not take drugs', 'don't sell your body for dope', or 'don't take diet pills because the fridge might eat you'. These are for you to figure out. Like Pi, another movie by the same director it almost has a documentary feel to it.This one though, unlike Pi that is shot in black and white with washed out imagery, is so sharp and crisp it feels even more real.This way it even hits you harder. A truly awesome movie that made me believe in filmmaking again.In times where Steven Spielberg carries the olympic flag at the winter games opening ceremony as the 'pillar of creativity and culture' these are the movies that show there are still filmmakers that believe in brilliant, truthful storytelling.",10,0,1,15 February 2002
