The Blair Witch Project," Don't read about it till you've seen it.
","Brilliantly conceived and executed, this film breaks all the rules of modern cinema.  Its stark simplicity is what makes it so terrifying.  Had the directors added anything at all, they would have diminished its potency.It is simply the most original and intelligent piece of filmmaking I have seen in decades.",10,1,2,22 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," It is the dumbest, most un-sexy film about sex imaginable
","It is the dumbest, most un-sexy film about sex imaginable.  The plot is worth no more than 40 minutes of screen time.  The other two hours are filled with droning irrelevant dialogue and empty pauses so excruciatingly long that you want to scream, 'CUT!  CUT ALREADY!'  The background music will make you want to commit yourself to a mental institution.Wait till it comes out on video tape, then rent something else.",1,2,5,20 July 1999
