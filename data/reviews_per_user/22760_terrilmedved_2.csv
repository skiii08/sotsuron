The Avengers," Went in with very high expectations, and was pleasantly surprised!
","Only one man in Hollywood that I could think of could take six superheroes and knit them together so seamlessly, giving them each a feeling of value to the team, have such a clever script and get the action sequences to such an exciting level. Whedon, after decades of hard work in television, has finally ascended from cult status and entered the big time with the highest grossing film of all time and an easy contender for one of the best movies in the genre of all time, if not certainly the most entertaining.I went in with very high expectations, expecting to enjoy it, but fearing that the film would be a bit beyond Joss's ability to make great. An ensemble cast of 8 main characters and it being the most anticipated film of the last 5 years with the studio breathing down the filmmakers' necks? That's a tough job description. I figured, it couldn't get better than 7/10, but I should've known not to doubt Whedon.Many will say that this film seems slow paced, but those are people who just want a popcorn flick with minimal character development and dialog. That said, if you pay attention to the dialog, this film manages to draw emotions from the audience, which is rare for a blockbuster type film. The film also manages to keep those scenes succinct enough to keep the audience from lulling. This film was made for the big screen, and was easily the most fun I've had at the theaters in my 28 years.If you are a fan of the comics, you will love how the characters all have their complex attributes displayed, and how all their strengths combine to form a team. You think, 'How will Captain America, Hawkeye or Black Widow be of any use when Iron Man, Hulk and Thor are out wrecking sh*t?', but there they are adding a dynamic to the team that would sorely needed in their absence. Captain is a born leader, Black Widow is manipulative and cunning, Hawkeye is incredibly reliable support, Iron Man and Thor wreck sh*t, Fury is the soul of the team, and Hulk smashes. The movie spends a lot of time setting things up, but does it so efficiently that you never really find yourself getting tired of all the exposition. As the story moves along, the humor in the script shines. The acting is solid across the board, with exceptional work by Downey who provides much needed lightness and Ruffalo who absolutely nailed Bruce Banner in a way that wasn't whiny and pathetic like Bana's or Norton's. The ending is as somber as it is victorious, and Whedon sets things up for what I hope is a much darker and more introspective sequel.While certainly not the greatest film of all time, for the genre, it couldn't get any better in my opinion. A movie like this is why big theaters exist, and if you wait until it comes out on DVD, you'll be missing out.",9,6,13,14 May 2012
Fantastic Four," I'm just going to make this short
","Most of the other REAL reviews have said everything I want to. I'll just say this.I would have given this movie a 3-4 out of 10 because while you can tell from other reviews how the script was God-Awful and the direction was poor, the Human Torch and the Thing were alright in my opinion. Sure, they were cheesy, but they made me laugh and I could almost get into the scenes where they were without the presence of the other two.HOWEVER This gets a 1/10 to help even out the rating that FOX HAS CORRUPTED BY USING STUDIO-PLANTED 10/10s. This truly disappoints me. I know that studios pay off small time hack critics all the time, but this is really low and pathetic. Try hiring talent and managing your projects better. This movie was completely sub-par on everything except the cgi (and most people who are more picky than I on special effects generally agree that it could have been much better too.)",1,69,136,9 July 2005
