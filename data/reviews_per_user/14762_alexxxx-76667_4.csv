",I like to watch school life movie. This is the best for me. Some points makes me feel sad. But the main character get friends and grew up story . That point is important in this movie.

I surprise in spit of many types of animal, the rabbit is the main character.Almost every animals appear in the movie, they express divide every feature. That is the same real world of humans. In the world, there is many types of humans. In the movie, there is happen accident that shaking world. But there is not develop into world war. So I think there is solution to the world. And many character drew very cute and young. In real world, that is not wrong. I want to drew characters, more real. Anyway, I enjoyed movie and think real world problem.",Null,0,2,26 July 2016
Finding Dory," importance of family
","I think the best important thing is family in my life. Dory is very poorest memory character in the movie. Such forgetful Dory, she remember some song or favorite phrase. These thing is taught by her parents. But she forgot that point. But one day, she remind she forgot about her family. She wants to find her parents. But she lives by herself by long time. Therefore her trip to find family is very difficult. I feel frustrate her poor memory. Marin also feel same. He hurts her by the word. Eventually, they gets into settlement to cooperate finding her family. When she can meets her family, I almost cried. Her family's generosity.",Null,1,6,26 July 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Good!!!
","I surprised Elgar/Pomp and Circumstance is used scene. I could not think like that scene. I think that scene is great common sense out. Pomp and Circumstance is the second national anthem. British how love that song by using that scene. And I think the main character as grew up story is also good point of this movie. Because he become suitable as a kings man. Kings man needs all knowledge and manners. In the first, he had nothing like that. But he grew up as a kings man and become strong. The cause why he become strong, there is sad of lost important person to him. So that persons die is not useless. But I think that person should not be died.",Null,1,4,27 July 2016
