Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," works on so many levels, and all of them make you laugh out loud
","I was used to Borat from 'da ali g show' and found him funny but didn't see how the joke could be spread over 90min. This movie really works , the joke doesn't become thin. In fact i don't really think i stopped laughing the whole way through....well maybe a few times just to catch my breath or feel uncomfortable for a moment.Its not there just to either attack Americans or people from Kazakhstan. The people who come across as bigoted do it to themselves.The point never sees to be laughing at Kazakhstan people either, its just to show how you can get away with making ludicrous claims about a place to many people as they never look outside their own countries. It makes the people on the receiving end look foolish and never really borat, who comes across as lovable and sympathetic. One of the most laugh out loud films I've ever seen.",10,3,15,4 November 2006
