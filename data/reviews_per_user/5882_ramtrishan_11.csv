It," Pretty good
","For a reboot it is very good, altough the old one is better. In the movie it doesn't feel like the 80's. The jumpscares were really good but this could have been better if they added some more jumpscares to it.",8,0,0,10 September 2019
Hereditary," Scary
",This movir from Ari Aster is a different kind of horror movie. It is more about the grieving process the family is dealing with. And i have to say that Toni Collette slayed her role. She really deserved a oscar for her role.,7,2,6,10 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Good
",I enjoyed it very much. I only wish Leia had a bigger part in the movie.,7,3,7,2 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Classic
",This movie is already a classic. Quentin Tarantino really shows how it is behind the scenes in hollywood. Leo and Brad performed good.,9,7,12,11 September 2019
Get Out," Great
","This movie is a masterpiece. Jordan Peele really made it to the top with this movie. Also the concept was really great. For 2017 you don't get many movies that have an original script. Most of them are reboot, prequel or sequel. The acting of daniel kaluuya was outstanding. Really great.",10,1,4,10 September 2019
Room," Masterpiece
","The performance of Brie Larson was great. And it is a shame that Jacob Tremblay didn't get an oscar for his performance. He really deserved more credits. If his acting wasn't so good, the acting of brie larson wouldn't have such an impact.",10,2,4,11 September 2019
The Lion King," Boring
","The CGI in the movie was really outstunning, but the movie didn't offer more than the original. The old one is much better.",4,0,0,11 September 2019
Drag Me to Hell," True Horror
",This is the best horror movie i have ever seen. The jumpscares were really good. The acting performance is great. A really must see if you like horror.,10,1,3,11 September 2019
Joker," PHENOMENAL
","The performance of joaquin phoenix is a masterpiece. If he doesn't get an oscar for this than I don't know wat is oscar worthy. You would't expect this from Todd Phillips, but he made a masterpiece.",10,4,7,24 October 2019
It Chapter Two," LAME
",You can't compare this to the 1st installment. It (2017) had much potential. It is a waste to see so much potential fade away in the 2nd installment. It was boring. Some of the flashback scenes weren't even necessary. There should have been more jumpscares in it and i wish i could have seen more of bill skarsgard's performance as pennywise. The ending didn't make sense. And the comedy shouldn't be in the movie. Sometimes a clown can be scarier than CGI monsters.,3,4,6,22 September 2019
The Lion King," The only true king
",For me the original is always better than the reboot. But this has such an emotional impact. Great.,10,2,2,24 September 2019
