"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," 'That's just what this country needs
","This is the absolute best film ever made about drag queens. It follows the life of three Austrailian beauties as they make their way across the outback in their lavender bus (Priscilla). It is a superb film, not only because of the fact that it shows a world that many have never seen, but also because all the stars are actually straight, which is unbelievable. Sure, it sugar coats the life of 'lay girls' but the film is so glamorous and fun that you forget that it's not  real.",Null,2,5,17 October 1999
Fight Club," You know it's violent when you consider 'Seven' as light compared to it
","This film was well acted, well directed, and well written. But I could barely sit through it. I found it to be so brutal and violent that much of the time I shut my ears and closed my eyes. Helena Bonham Carter is great (and completely different as we've ever seen her) as Marla, a slightly disturbed woman. Plus, for all you yuppy Califorians, there is one cool thing in Edward Norton's refirgerator: Mendocino Mustard (that's a small town on the coast of Northern California). Plus, don't miss Meatloaf with breasts (don't ask).",7,0,2,17 October 1999
Coffee and Cigarettes," One good scene
","I love films so much that the idea of falling asleep in one in a movie theater makes me sad. But I did, and it happened in this movie. I have to say that the best part of this film is the scene with Alfred Molina. It was so representative and indicative of how social situations work, that was just beautiful. Everything else just wasn't my bag. It had this feeling to it, this tempo that drove me a bit crazy, drove me to sleep. It was like the jazz of cinema--always playing behind, over, under, but never with the beat. But I did get to see it with foreign subtitles, which made even the dull scenes hilarious at times. For example, IHOP was translated to 'Il bar del'angolo' (the bar on the corner). Ah, good times.",Null,1,4,9 November 2004
American Beauty," Does anyone care?
","Does anyone care about my little perception on this film? I thinknot. But I don't care at this point. In sixty years I'll be dead anyway.And if imdb.com is the only for me to make my mark on the world,so be it. I saw this film twice. The first time I was blown away. Thesecond time I felt like a whore lying in a gutter. Is there a middlingpoint between these two emotions? I think not. Because like thefilm, I am only able to feel in black and white.And sometimes red.",Null,0,0,26 December 2000
