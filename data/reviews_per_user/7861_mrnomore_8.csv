Ford v Ferrari," I'm not a Christian Bale fan
","I'm not a Christian Bale fan. Probably because of all the off-screen cocktails he's been blending, but i must say, I really liked his character. He played so good, i forgot i dislike him. Probably his best performance EVER as an actor.This movie is well made into the last piece of paper on a shelf in an unimportant area of the screen. It feels like a solid ride through a well-written world of car history.I'm not a big engine-man. For me, it was perfect.",10,1,2,30 January 2020
A Star Is Born," Not nearly as good as I expected
","This is a good 'Pretty Woman' story, gone sideways. Everything feels too simplified, too stressed. There was never enough time to put such an extensive tale into such a short time. I think this would have played better as a 4 hour silver journey or a mini-series.I read something about great musical scores, But the music in this movie isn't great. I didn't noticed anything more then what you can hear on over-bribed radio stations these days. Probably less.Hollywood... The artistic part is gone. Young people feed on events inspired by tragic soap opera moments and topics snatched from old classics. It's like McDonald's. You eat, but you'll never get full...",5,2,3,3 March 2019
Edward Scissorhands," Tim Burton is the only one that could create such magic.
","Minor Spoilers in Part1Edward Scissorhands is a beautiful yet disturbing movie about a character that steps out of darkness and isolation straight into lives of some small town folks. Through his odd 'talent' he makes his way into peoples hearts and discovers a new and wonderful side of life....but, as always, there is ignorance and enviousness.Tim Burton could not make it better then this. The environment, the colors, the music, the characters, everything is just perfect. Your heart will never stop pounding. You will laugh, you will cry, you will smile, but you will NEVER forget this movie. Pure magic!9/10. Go Mr.Burton! :)",9,0,0,16 February 2004
The Usual Suspects," A feast for your mind!
","This IS the best movie i have ever seen. And the story IS the best ever written. People that don´t understand this film should not be commenting on it because it will create a huge confusion. This is a 'must see' movie with no 'but's. I also like to point out that if anyone writes a movie comment, it would be nice if they DO NOT reveal the end OR the meaning of it.Anyway, i watch 1-4 movies a day and i have been doing it for the last 15 years and i have to say that this is the ONLY clear '11 out of 10' movie ever made.",10,0,1,9 December 2003
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," For shallow people seeking for nostalgia
","QT begun his carrier with a punch, but he finish it with a fart.
The only thing worth mentioning in this movie is the attention to details and Brad Pitt. Both as Brad Pitt and Cliff Booth. Maybe, this movie should be about Cliff instead. Other then that, it's just like going to a supermarket on a Sunday afternoon, expecting nothing to happen.The few laughs and the very few meaningful scenes are far, far away anything remotely close to a good movie. It's like a professional collage project.My friend, who brought this movie to my attention and even payed for the tickets to make me go with him, actually fell asleep. My other friend went to the toilette in the middle of it. Something a movie fanatic would never do.4/10 for couple laughs, some of the mood and Brad/Cliff",4,7,15,12 September 2019
Pi," Oh, my god. What a disappointment!
","I really can´t understand how this movie could get so much attention. The story is very interesting, but just for a while. Almost half of the movie is about main characters headache. At the end, i was so bored that i fell asleep. It´s a shame because it could be a really god movie. I saw it after i read comments on it and it all sounded good enough for me. That´s why i just had to write this one.4 out of 10.",4,1,2,8 December 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Not even half as good as 'LADY SNOWBLOOD'
","This is Quentin Tarantino´s very poor attempt to make an Hollywood version of 'Lady Snowblood'. I was extremely disappointed wen i saw 'Kill Bill Vol.1' and there are many reasons why.The Reasons Vol.1According to some sources, this movie was inspired by a great Japanese movie 'Lady Snowblood'. The story is´nt exactly the same, but close enough. Music and environment are very similar, but then 'Lady Snowblood' have something that 'Kill Bill' does´nt. Meiko Kaji, who plays the revenging women is about 300 times better actress then 'Uma-i-should-be-a-waitress-Thurman'.The Reasons Vol.2Quentin has become a 'Hollywoodirector'. Same as John Woo and other great directors, he forgot what he was doing in the beginning. The money is killing these guys and the great art that they have been doing for so many years.The Reasons Vol.3 (!!Spoilers!!)One big annoying flaw. How is it possible for a white girl to kill an Asian assassin, who has been trained since god know how many years?Well, i could write all knight, but i hope that you people understand one thing. This should be a samurai movie and the ONLY thing that make this movie worth watching is Lucy Liu. She´s just perfect!!Kill BillMe...............3/10 IMDB users.....8.2/10Lady SnowbloodMe...............9/10 IMDB users.....8.5/10",1,13,24,13 January 2004
True Romance," Great Movie!!!
","This is a fantastic movie. Written by a genius, directed by another one and the cast is just the best of all time. Christian and Patricia really look like a couple.There are three scenes that makes this hole movie stunning. First: Christopher Walken is about to whack Dennis Hopper. Second: Patricia is getting beat up by James Gandolfini. Third: Christian Slater got shut.Oh my god!!! These scenes are impossible to describe. At the moment you are filled with emotions like never before during a movie, and it´s a promise! If you hav´nt seen this movie, i suggest that you buy, rent or borrow it at once. You won´t be disappointed. It´s a True Romance!10/10 without 'buts'!",10,1,2,13 December 2003
