National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Brilliant movie
","I've been waiting for this second part from a long time, but it was worth it. It's one of the few movies who have a very good second part. Very good script, very good acting (I like Nicholas Cage). At the end of the movie, i was really speechless. This is happening when you have a big budget, a great director, a great acting crew. Thanks to all of them and thanks to producers also. Of course, i want to see once again this movie when it will appears on DVD. And all i have to do is wait for a third part (if there it will be one). I recommend this movie to all of you. It's kinda of a new year's present from the producers. Nicholas Cage was, as usually, amazing in this movie.",10,1,5,28 December 2007
