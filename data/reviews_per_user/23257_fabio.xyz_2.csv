Gladiator," Only good entertainment
","The only thing that could be said about Gladiator, the last Ridley Scott's movie, is good entertainment.  But is not far from the scheme of the classical American action movie: the male protagonist, his revenge to obtain, the final duel with the villain.  The initial scene of the night battle promised other and higher emotions...By the way I was born in Rome and I live in Rome and the ancient Rome of the movie is not a good representation.",Null,8,13,28 June 2000
