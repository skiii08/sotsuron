The Avengers," It's not the script that makes this movie great... but it's great nonetheless
","The Avengers is a great movie, but not due to its plot. It's a simple MacGuffin chase, culminating in a random big fight. Also, the editing felt unfinished from time to time.Nevertheless... it's not the plot that is supposed to make the Avengers a great movie. It's the fact that it brings stories and characters from other movies together. In a way, the Avengers is the finale of a bigger whole.The lack of plot gives the opportunity to zoom into the different characters and how they respond to each other. We learn how Bruce Banner and Tony Stark connect. We see how The Hulk and Thor have a measurement of strength. How the straight morals of Captain America conflicts with the happy go lucky attitude of Iron Man.We also get a closer look at SHIELD and we learn that the agency has its moral questionabilities. When we move beyond the Avengers, we learn how that is so in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The choice for Loki to be the main villain connects to the firs Avengers comic. And in many other ways as well , the movie pays its respect to the comics - as we're used to in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The Avengers movie is a mile stone in the MCU, and yes, its greatest merit is being the Avengers movie.It's not the plot that makes this movie great. It's the fact that it's the pay-off for earlier established characters and stories, and laying the ground work for more great stuff to come.",9,1,3,14 April 2014
Iron Man 3," Tony Stark embarks on a 'meh' adventure with silly villains
","Hooray for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for bringing us great movies such as The Incredible Hulk, Tha Avengers and the Iron Man movies. However, the third installment of Iron Man is not on par...The movie has a convoluted plot involving a Fire Zombie Virus, that is spread among war veterans by a guy who had been stood up by Tony Stark in the nineties and now wants to take over the world or something. Also, Tony Stark is suffering from PTSS because being an Avenger scared him so much. This is an issue that will not get resolved in a proper manner, it just ends with the movie. For some reason, War Machine could not be called War Machine anymore. Plus, Tony Stark has a gazillion suits that function independent from him. And Pepper dies but she doesn't die. And then there's the Mandarin, who isn't the Mandarin. The ending is particularly weird. Tony Stark stops being Iron Man - destroys all of his suits, has his impossible to remove shrapnel removed from his heart, and tells in voice-over that he IS Iron Man.Does this make any sense to you? Well, it is Iron Man 3 in a nutshell. A lot of stuff that is either too far-fetched or too ridiculous to keep the suspension of disbelief up. Robert Downey Junior is okay in this movie, as is Gwyneth Paltrow. But the rest of the cast is fairly not up for the job or their parts are redundant. One exception on this is Sir Ben Kingsley. His performance is really what is saving the movie, both before and after the infamous 'twist'.Kingsley's acting plus the fact that it's still an Iron Man movie is what makes the movie somewhat digestible - but the fans deserve better.",6,0,3,2 September 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Awesome action. Bland characters.
","I'm sorry. I like to write reviews without spoilers, but this time there is no way to work around it. So let's just jump ahead to the spoiler part, you'll find my opinion later on.The reason I spoil, has to do with the rewrites and re-shoots. It shows. It painfully shows. Due to them, character motivations made no sense and plot point either came out of nowhere or went nowhere or both. Most prominent examples (spoilers) are the mind reading tentacle beast that was supposed to drive this one pilot crazy, and the reasons for the Forrest Whitakker character to remain on the planet that partially exploded. He said he was tired of running. But no hint was given in the movie of him even running at all. He was - for as far as he was established - established as a fighter, not a runner. Him staying behind MADE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER!Beyond the re-shoots, characterization is lacking throughout the entire movie. They are not properly built op, so they rise no viewers interest. Most of them are so unmemorable, you don't even get to remember their name. They hit plot points, but they have no character arcs. Well, the ninja zen guy was coming close to being a memorable character. But overall, K2S0, the robot, gets to have the most personality.The whole movie is plot driven, not character driven. It really really really hinges on being related to Star Wars. As a viewer, you get to care for the mission and the rebellion, but not really for the individual characters. Therefore, scenes that were supposed to be very emotional, such as the respective deaths of Forrest Whitakker and Mr Urso, lacked all impact whatsoever.Some of the nods to Star Wars were great, some were out of place. Most awful was the appearance of 'testicle chin guy' and 'you'll be dead guy' for no reason. Kind of like cramming Chewie and Boba Fett into the prequels, just making the universe smaller. Then, there was Darth Vader's agility in the final scene. Him doing all this lightsaber acrobatics in the final scene looked great - but made no sense. You don't see him this agile at any point in the original trilogy. Vader living on Mustaphar made no sense, but not in a way that was disturbing. Just... weird... Who would build his house at the site where you got your limbs chopped off by your friends?The incorporation of Mon Mothma and Senator Organa into this movie was done pretty good. Knowing these characters from previous movie provided the emotional anchor that the original new characters lacked. They didn't steal the show, though. They worked as side characters, and did their jobs correctly. Going back to Yavin4 was good. And the C-3PO and R2D2 cameo was done perfectly. It wasn't dragged out, and it made sense for them to be where they were. Perfect.Digital Tarkin and digital Leia were... okay I guess...And general not-Ackbar... was... there... Did he have to be a fish person? Either have the fish person be Ackbar, or have him be another race. Or, if you insist on having him a fish person, then at least make his character significantly different from Ackbar. What are you saying, Star Wars? All fish people are the same? That's racist!But, the final battle was pretty awesome. However, if you expect the scene from the trailer of the Jyn character facing a Tie-fighter, while only wielding a blaster... IT'S NOT THERE! I enjoyed seeing a Saving Private Ryan type of movie in the Star Wars universe, but it would have been so much better if it had actual characters.PS; what's the deal with the tentacle mind monster thing?",7,1,4,2 January 2017
Iron Man 2," What Iron Man 3 tried to do, Iron Man 2 already did
","Yes, here is another review comparing Iron Man 3 to another movie. For one very simple reason, this time. Iron Man 2 already did what Iron Man 3 tried to do. Iron Man 2 succeeded, while Iron Man 3 failed.In Iron Man 3, the question is said to be raised whether Tony Stark or the suit makes Iron Man. Well, Since we have already seen other people taking on the suit, we know the answer. In IM1 we saw Stane have a stab at it, and in IM2 it was Vanco. Neither of them made a decent Iron Man - so Iron Man IS Tony Stark.In Iron Man 3, we were told to expect some buddy-cop moments between Tony and Rhodey. We just saw the latter wandering around, contributing nothing to the plot. In IM2, Rhodey was the one friend that Tony had. Giving him the occasional butt-kick if needed, but also be the one Tony could share stuff with he couldn't share with Pepper. He event went so far as to let Rhodey inherit an IM suit.In Iron Man 3, we were told to expect the exploration what Tony Stark would do if he hit his all time low. If that is so, then he would treat his all time low as a temporary set-back. Well, his house did get blown up, but it didn't affect his behaviour. And neither did the PTSD, except for walking out of a room once or twice. In IM2, we saw Tony at the brink of dying from his own hands. It affected his behaviour. Made him go a little crazy, made him giving away stuff (like his company and IM suit), turned him into an alcoholic. He got so weird, that even SHIELD director Nick Fury had to intervein at one point. If you want to see Stark at his all time low, IM2 is the movie you want to see.I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but even if you want to see Pepper do some heroics, you can get it in IM2. And yet again, it is handled better than in IM3.To make a long story short. The territory that is explored in IM3 was already explored in IM2 - just better and more profoundly. Making IM3 a redundant movie and all the more disappointing. If you want to see a good Iron Man story, that is not an origin story, Iron Man 2 is the one you should see...",8,2,3,14 October 2013
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The worst of the bunch... 'nuff said
","The X-movies have some genuine gems. There is no debate in X2 or Days of Future Past being awesome films. But X-Men Origins: Wolverine is lacking. Apart from explosions, it has nothing to offer.The plot - if you can call it one - is incoherent and far fetched. It's supposed to shed new light on how Wolverine got both his adamantium claws as well as his amnesia. Not wanting to go into spoiler territory, I can only say that X2 delivered it already and whatever extra was brought to the table made it more confusing and convoluted.While the original X-trilogy were ensemble movies, I feel that the creators of XO:W were shy to move away from that, but didn't know how to handle that into a flick that's just about one guy. It resulted in a chain of: 'Here's a character. Now he's dead. Here's another character. Now he's dead, too', going on for the entirety of the movie.In the process, they butchered Deadpool, a beloved Marvel character, into something that doesn't even remotely resemble his comic counterpart. Although Ryan Reynolds was the perfect cast-pick to play him, the movie decided to literally have his mouth sown shut.One redeeming quality in the movie was Liev Schreiber's portrayal of Victor Creed, a.k.a. Sabretooth. He made him the menacing sadist bully he's supposed to be. Just too bad that was IN THIS MOVIE.If you want more from a movie then just shooting and explosions, this is not the film for you...",4,1,3,16 June 2014
X-Men," 'A New Hope' for Comic Book Movies
","When this movie came out, comic book movies were down on their @$$es. The last big comic book movie until then was 'Batman and Robin', so basically: the genre was dead and killed. It was no other movie than X-Men that re-ignited the genre and proved that a comic fantasy world does not have to be corny, goofy and cheesy at all.Bryan Singer created a suspenseful story, in which the characters had to deal with being different - and the conflict that rises from bigotry.'In the not too distant future', Prof. Charles Xavier has a school for so-called mutants: people who are different. Generally, these mutants possess abilities that normal people do not have - which causes fear and hate in the hearts of the American people. Hence, Senator Robert Kelly proposes a law that calls for mutants to register themselves. Xaviers frenemy, Erik 'Magneto' Lensherr, is appalled by this law and plots to spread mutancy among world leaders at a UN summit. Xavier's X-Men Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey struggle to stop Magneto. In the middle of these conflicts runaway mutants Rogue and Wolverine take refuge at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters...It's a brilliant movie, with tons of easter eggs and nods to the fans. While not lacking action or fantastic elements, the movie plays the brain card. It is clever, slightly dark. Remember how recently, the second installment of Captain America (The Winter Soldier) was described as a political thriller? Well, X-Men did it first.But what really excels X-Men is how it captures the emotional impact of being different. How the daily struggle of minorities is portrayed through the metaphor of Mutancy. It is what sets X-Men apart from other super hero / comic book movies; it is their Trump Card. Therefor, it's a shame that this element is being shoved more and more to the background as the X-Movie franchise expands. I hope in the future, they will look back at this first one from time to time, if only to remember what the 'X-Gene' of this series is.All in all, X-Men brought back comic book movies. It did for the genre what Star Wars (A New Hope) did for Space Movies. So, maybe there are comic book movies you enjoy more than this... they would not be here if it wasn't for the X-Men and their first movie. I have never granted a 10/10 to a movie before, but this one deserves it.",10,2,3,1 November 2014
Suicide Squad," Kind of the best DC-Universe movie
","As far as movies within the DC universe go, this was the best (ish) so far. It's not a good movie, but the potential is showing. I liked it - but it was far from perfect.I liked how it started non-linear, but as the movie progressed they moved into a more traditional structure - taking away from the competitive edge.Characters were introduced twice, which was redundant. Just having them introduced through Amanda Waller's narration at the meeting would have been sufficient. Moreover, one member of the team did not have an introduction in the beginning of the film (let alone two), so when this character appears halfway the movie, you KNOW he/she will be dead within minutes.The soundtrack was phenomenal. The song selection was the best ever in a movie... but all the songs were cut off too soon, so you didn't get to stay in the mood they were supposed to set. They kept on playing a note or two, and right after you recognize the song they cut it away. This is REALLY REALLY REALLY annoying. Worst was the Eminem song, which they chopped up so the part that they actually played was robbed of its flow.And we must discuss the Joker, and Jared Leto's portrayal of the character. The character had a whole lot of build-up. Both in the movie itself, as in the marketing around it. Therefore, the actual LACK OF RELEVANCE he had to the plot was an UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. Although Leto went totally method to get the part right, his acting came off more as imitating the Joker instead of being the Joker. And the design of the character didn't help. Maybe it's just some getting used to. But it's definitely not love at first sight.To end on a positive note: this has a slight edge on BvS and is indefinitely better than MoS. Plus, they made this before MARVEL made a Thundbolts movie. Kudos for that.",7,1,1,29 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," The Avengers meet The Bourne Identity
","In an attempt to stop evil things from happening, Captain America teams up and fights the good fight. No, I'm not talking about the Howling Commandoes or the Avengers. It's Agent Hill, the Black Widow and Falcon he teams up with. One might call this a 'light version' of the Avengers, but movie-wise it goes toe-to-toe with it and even stands a chance of winning.For one; CA:TWS has a superior plot. Plotwise, the Avengers - a great movie in all respects – was basically a MacGuffin chase with a big random fight in the end. CA:TWS is a political thriller, a spy movie if you like. Choque full of intrigues. But with Super Heroes...The characterization in this movie is pretty amazing. There is depth added to the already established characters of Cap, Fury and Widow. The relationship between Cap and Fury has obviously evolved since the last time we saw the two, as Cap is now on first name basis with Fury. On the other hand, the trust issues that are glimpsed at in The Avengers have grown to an extent of animosity. We also see Cap dealing with his new reality and seeking closure for his old one. Then, last but not least, the way Falcon is introduced is flat-out BEAUTIFUL.As for the bad guys... it is pretty obvious to figure which is which. They do have a Deus Ex Machina on their side, namely the Winter Soldier – after which the movie was called. However, in the first two acts he remains rather side-casted; quite like Malekith in Thor: The Dark World. Towards the end, this little problem gets fixed more.Then... o my... the cinematography. It is beautiful. The 3D works best in the quieter scenes, when you have time to take it all in. And thankfully, the movie has plenty of that. But it does not only have quieter scenes. The action scenes are equally beautiful. Although the movie is not completely free of shaky cam, it is not overused. Actually, the use of shaky cam is so fitting, you barely notice it's there. The effects are as much practical and as little digital as possible, giving the movie a feel of reality that is very rare these days.If all of this isn't enough, the movie is superfluous in call-backs, tie-ins, references and easter eggs that give the movie so much for viewers who are familiar with the universe as established in earlier movies. Mentions of Iron Man, Bruce Banner, Stark Industries, and so forth. And also, we get the first mention of Dr. Strange. This movie is the best phase 2 Marvel movie thus far.",9,7,13,13 April 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," Decent, but not mind-blowing
","It appears that every phase in the MCU has its weaker link. In phase 2, for obvious reasons, it was 'Iron Man 3'. Phase 1's weaker movie was 'Captain America - the first Avenger'.Why it was called 'the first Avenger' remains unknown. After all; Iron Man was the first one to be drafted as an Avenger, and Thor was the first born Avenger by a couple of hundreds of years. And Cap's team in this movie was called 'The Howling Commando's' and not 'The Avengers'. One's best guess to why this was called 'the First Avenger' is simply for commercial reasons. And it becomes pretty obvious that this one is pretty much filler, to kill time until 'the Avengers' was released.Even if I wanted to spoil the movie, it's quite impossible not to. Not only is it commonly known that Cap was encased in ice since the end of world war 2; it is also the beginning of the movie. After a team of assumable SHIELD agents retrieves him, the movie flashed back to the forties.A meek Steve Rogers wants to do his share in the war, but is refused to do so for being to small and sick. Then, a professor thinks he has potential and puts him up for the Super Soldier Experiment, turning Steve into Captain America. Meanwhile, Red Skull gets his hands on the Tesseract (which will be the major MacGuffin in 'the Avengers') and uses it to gain world domination. It is up to Captain America to stop him. By doing so, Cap gets trapped in ice for seventy years or so.The way Steve turns into a 'capsicle' is through a plot-hole of Rosebud proportions. Obviously for the purpose of selling toys, the plane where the final fight takes place, is filled with means of escaping. The inevitable ice-crash was plot-wise unnecessary. That stings.Of course, it's not ALL bad. The 'super-running' in this movie matches what Blonsky does in 'the Incredible Hulk'; CA:TFA has lots of fun details and easter eggs like that. And the characters are really promising. It's sequel, 'The Winter Soldier', proves that the character of Captain America lends itself to make really good movies.Honest Trailers called this movie 'Captain America: The First Avengers Trailer', to which I have to admit it is. Plus, a commercial for Captain America toys. Those elements cloud its potential that is has to being a really great movie. Now, it is still decent, but not mind-blowing",7,0,1,24 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Redemption complete!
","The X-Men franchise Brian Singer started, delivered us two great movies before spiraling a path downwards. X3 - the first X-Movie without Singer writing or directing - did not have what it takes storywise and had a mishmash of a plot. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' is a movie best to be forgotten, almost bringing the X-franchise to its death. Then, with 'First Class' and 'The Wolverine' a road to redemption was taken, and reached its destiny in 'Days of Future Past'.It's a thrill from beginning to end. Hearing the original theme music again felt like coming home, and then the movie itself: excellent.We meet some new mutants, some familiar mutants, and however some of them gets cast aside too quickly - none of them feel redundant. The movie provides us lots of action, without stalling plot advancements.Offcourse, it's not a flawless movie. It is never explained how Kitty Pryde acquired her new skill to send peoples minds into younger versions of themselves. Again, it's a Wolverine-centered movie... Apart from 'first class' he never gets to take a back seat and thus upstaging other mutants. Granted, the plot points out a necessity for him to be the one who time-travels. And even with the time traveling, some of the plot holes established in earlier movies were not fixed.However, in itself, this movie is brilliant. And even if not all plot holes get fixed, at least you leave the theater feeling that they did. Elaborating on all this brings me into spoiler territory, which is where I don't want to go. I would love for you to go see it and form your own opinion. Go do that now!",9,0,0,26 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," As good as Star Wars
","Guardians of the Galaxy is a more obscure comic from the ranks of Marvel. Its movie adaptation however, turns out to be an enormous hit. And it deserves to be.The plot is a MacGuffin chase, strongly relying on heavy action and colorful characters. And in that, 'Guardians' succeeds gloriously; in many respects it does it better then 'Avengers'.A bunch of anti-heroes from space is forced by circumstances to work together and stop evil. Not getting along, they stumble themselves and each other in trouble; time and again. However action-packed, all the action stems from characterization. It is not simply an action-adventure movie that has characters in it; it's a character movie that plunges itself into action.It is different from other Marvel movies that have come out so far, but the point is: it works. It works good. Who would have thought that a movie adaptation of an obscure comic could be as good as Star Wars? I wouldn't, but having seen it I must admit it is.",9,2,6,22 September 2014
Logan," Take notes, Marvel. This is ground breaking.
","'Logan' is an X-cellent movie. Period. It takes the comic book movie genre to a whole new level. A tred on new grounds that is long overdue. It's not just another action adventure. It's a western noir. And I'm loving heaven and earth out of it.The story takes some clues from the 'Old Man Logan' mini series. But readers of the X-Men comics would also recognize some 'Messiah Complex' or 'Second Coming' influences in there. The end of mutant kind, with just the tiniest hint of hope - in the hands of a child. And it takes the full resources of all who is left (which aren't many) to protect it.Marvel should takes notes from this. There have been movies in which the characters were at the end of their ropes. Both 'Iron Man 3' and 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' were supposed to take their main characters to super dire straits, but totally lacked the gravitas and general feel of it. Please, Marvel. Have the guts to take your characters to the edge of damnation. And let us, as viewers, experience deep emotions while partaking in your stories. Fox, of all companies, just proved it can be done.'Logan' however, is not flawless. It has its nonsense. Actually, it has the same nonsense in it as both the earlier installments of the 'Wolverine' solo movies. There are some 'now you see them, now they're dead'-characters, and there is this this overpowered unstoppable baddie near the end of the movie that is slightly ridiculous... but this is really toned down and made to feel not unfit. Also, there isn't an over-abundance of non-existence future tech. So all in all, despite it being a movie about mutants, and taking place in the future, the entire movie feels very grounded in reality.After the dour tone, and the realistic groundedness, a third quality that needs to be presented in this review is the cinematography. The lighting, the focus, the pacing... it's all spot on! Scenes are given the time to breathe, and the sets and locations are glorious to look at. Not in the sense that they look glamorous - because they don't. But they really helped to set the tone and tell the story. It's perfect.Then, there are some nice nods to the comics. One of the minor characters, presented in the third act, is Rictor. In the comics, he is part of X-Factor. One of the supporting characters is Caliban. I like the fact that they changed him from a man-child into a highly intelligent person - but they kept his sense of loyalty intact. The bad guys also derive from the comics, as do of course Logan himself, professor Xavier and X23. But, despite these nods, the movie still feels fresh and original. Just like the ridiculousness, they really kept the comic book winks restraint. And it feels all the better for it.All in all. You don't have to be into comic books, or superhero movies, to enjoy 'Logan'. It works as a movie outside of its genre. But if you ARE into comic books, and if you ARE into superhero movies, this is the breath of fresh air that the genre desperately needed. I hope there is more like this to come.",10,2,7,30 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Great action, lacked build-up
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has a disadvantage to the first 'Avengers'-movie; namely that it ISN'T THE FIRST 'AVENGERS'-MOVIE. The first one could do with little plot (a simple MacGuffin chase), leaving a large chunk of the movie open for the characters to interact and explore each other - have a team being born. The sequel needed more than that - but did not quite deliver. All in all, it's a decent middle-episode of a series - but it lacks in rememberability.Although there is some over-use of shaky-cam (hold the camera still, so we can actually take in what happens, for a change), the action is good to great. The movie tends to drag it a little - probably pandering to the 'Michael Bay'-like audience. The greatest problem of this film is the lack of build-up. Ultron was created to protect the world, but the second he erects he decides he should destroy it. Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch switch sides several times in the movie, without building up their motivation to do so.The few times the movie does take its time to invest in the characters - it does so at the party and at the farm - it does it greatly. This is why I want to see the Avengers: because I like the characters, I want to explore them and know them better.Also; there is great humor in this movie. There's a running gag of Captain America feeling uncomfortable with potty-mouth, which plays well into him being from the forties. Then, the running gag over Thor's hammer even gets to serve the plot - and Quicksilver's one-liner goes full-circle in the movie (according to the rule of three). Also, the movie does not only acknowledge its ridiculousness, it even celebrates it. That's something that could have salvaged 'Iron Man Three', where the movie asks us to take things serious that are too dumb for words.And that brings us to 'Age of Ultron' in relation to the other MCU movies. Some things are glossed over or rushed, just like the evilness of Ultron. For instance: - The opening is a great action-wise (re)introduction to the Avengers... but why are they working together? They split up after the first 'Avengers'-movie, didn't they? And didn't Iron Man retire after IM3? - Apartently, Dr. Selvig went cuckoo after the first 'Avengers'- movie ~ as was depicted in Thor2. Now, when Thor comes to visit him (for a scene that stalled the movie instead of contributing to it), he appeared to be fine. - Didn't Iron Man get rid of his drone-suits when he retired at the end of IM3? Now, they're back.Either they did the other movies wrong, or they should have taken time to get these things out of the way. Either way, it reeks of missed opportunity.All in all, I don't feel that 'Age of Ultron' is 'The Empire Strikes Back' to the 'Avengers'' 'Star Wars'. Instead, it's a decent middle- of-the-season episode of a cool TV-series such as 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'.",7,6,14,4 May 2015
X-Men: First Class," X-Men... & Robin
","I once heard that 'X-Men First Class' was supposed to be the least comic-booky movie in the franchise. If this was indeed the aim for the film, it failed miserably. I have never seen an X-movie this campy.True, it's better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', but that is the only thing I can say in its favor. The sets, the characters, the costumes, the effects and most of all the story were BAD.I think they tried to bring in the cheerfulness from the Spider-Man trilogy and the MCU, but... no. This didn't work.The only good stuff was the part in which Magneto hunts down his old Nazi-enemies. Probably some left overs from the 'Origins: Magneto' script, proving it a shame that they didn't go along with that movie. The Magneto movie would have been great.In 'First Class', we see beloved characters Banshee, Emma Frost, Sebastian Shaw, Havok, Moira MacTaggert and Beast having little to do with their counterparts from the source material. Major plot points such as how Xaviers turns cripple and characters changing sides were abrupt with no build-up what so ever.The final fight was huge. Too huge. There were so many missiles, it stopped making sense. As little sense as the bad guys plan to create a war.After this movie, 'The Wolverine' and 'Days of Future Past' came out. Not without their flaws, but at least proving that good X- Movies can still be made. But First Class... well, it's better than 'Origins', but still no good. It's the X-version of Batman & Robin.",5,1,2,10 November 2014
The Wolverine," The Marvel Cinematic Universe should take notes from this
","I will not say that 'the Wolverine' is not without flaws. The attempts at humor are awfully out of character or out of tone for the rest of the movie. The scene in which Wolverine is forced to take a bath is cringingly bad. And there's debate on whether the 'return of the upright chopsticks' is a goof or not. The pitch-perfect F-bomb from 'X-men First Class' is recycled here, and on occasion Wolverine is not just a ruffian but a straight forward jerk.And the entire third act is so out of place, it's almost like you're watching another movie.However, having this said, 'the Wolverine' redeems a lot what went wrong in the X-men franchise. It was a bold move to take the super-hero movie out of the action-adventure cliché and use the concept for a character study with noir qualities. It was darker and more profound... like 'Iron Man 3' attempted to be and failed at. Comparing the two movies would be in place.In both movies, it is explored what remains of the 'man' if the superpowers are taken away. Iron Man is not able to use his suit, Wolverine's healing factor is trimmed down. Wolverine knows the stakes are up and acts accordingly, Iron Man remains his old witty self and considers his loss of power merely as a temporary set-back.Another point is comparison is the way both characters handle trauma. Wolverine is torn by guilt, for having to kill Jean Grey in 'X3'; Iron Man is traumatized from being an Avenger (though far worse things have happened to him). Wolverines guilt-complex is envisioned by visions of Jean, that evolves as the events in the movie progress, leading up to redemption. Iron Man has PTSD that is just there, ruining the pace of the movie, and going no-where.Both movies go all-out ridiculous in the third act. But, apart from that, 'the Wolverine' does right what 'Iron Man 3' does wrong.",8,2,5,24 September 2013
Iron Man," You'll believe a man can fly!
","After seeing the first 'Iron Man' again recently, I can't believe how far the MCU has strayed from this. The one that started it all, and it is hard to believe it takes place in the same universe as other Marvel movies - such as Guardians of The Galaxy.Although 'Iron Man' definitely has its fantastic elements, it is all grounded into a deep level of realness. And in keeping it real lies the refreshing bit. The realness makes the funny more funny, the amazing more amazing, and the emotional more emotional. And due to how much the movie is grounded in reality, you'll believe a man can fly.Arms-manufacturer Tony Stark is captured by terrorists, who appear to own several of his creations. After his escape, Stark turns a new leaf, shutting down the weapons department of his company. Instead of building weapons of destruction, he becomes a vigilant knight in shiny armor (with lasers and repulsors).All in all, it is a very good origins story. The acting by Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Palthrow, Terrence Howard and Jeff Bridges is outstanding - the witty dialogue alone makes for a good movie.Not only is 'Iron Man' the start of an Iron Man franchise, it is also the birth of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie brings up a lot of key elements for the later to appear Avengers movie: Enter Iron Man. Enter the Arc Reactor. Enter Agent Coulson. Enter S.H.I.E.L.D. And do stay and watch until the end of the credits, for something that created massive nerd-gasms back in the day.",9,2,3,29 November 2014
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Really, not that bad.
","Going into this movie, I was expecting a horrible film of the likes of Fant4stic. This, due to all the bad stuff I heard and read about it. Expecting a train-wreck, I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.First: the cinematography was beautiful. I even dare to say sublime. As well was the casting. Ben Affleck is by far the best Batman/Bruce Wayne in any live action piece. Jeremy Irons, although a bit young for the role, is an excellent Alfred.Having said that, I must admit that BvS is not without flaws. It has gotten red flag - and for good reason. I can list them: 1.) BvS is trying so hard to set up Justice League, that it forgets to be its own movie from time to time. Lets call this the Age of Ultron flaw - where tie-ins seem more important than the actual movie. 2.) An overuse of dream sequences makes it that it's hard to determine what is dreamt and what is real. 3.) The movie backs away from the questions it raises. Instead of Superman's trial - for instance - we got... something else... 4.) The movie goes out of its way of saying that there are no normal people around when the big fights occur, as if it's scared of innocent bystanders getting killed (while this issue was the whole raison d'etre of the Batman/Superman conflict); as if it's trying to reassure it's audience. I get why they felt the need to do that, after MoS, but they should have stuck to their guns. This hammering to the fact that there's no innocent bystander casualties is counter productive. 5.) Lex Luthor was miscast and misdirected. He came of more as the Joker than he did Luthor.Then, there is the ending. Which I thought was a bold and interesting choice: taking one of the heroes out of the equation; and have the Justice League be started in his honor - instead of him being part of the Justice League. But mere seconds before the credits rolled - they backed away from this premise. Ruining the ending.In short: this movie could have been really good, if it stayed focused on its own story. There were some bold choices that did not work but were left in the movie - and some that might have worked if they didn't back away from it. It seems that this is the problem with DC-movies: they don't really know what to do, making them not live up to their potential.",7,2,6,8 May 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Worthy follow-up to both Thor and the Avengers
","I must admit, after seeing a mere mediocre Iron Man 3, which was saved by the actors as opposed to delivering an exciting story... I worried for the Marvel Phase 2 as a whole. Thor: The Dark World proved me wrong.Yes, it has its weaknesses. There is a scene where Thor and Loki are walking down the hall; Loki transforms them into a number of different characters. It serves no other purpose then amusing the children - adults will find the scene embarrassingly annoying. When a major character dies, leaving an impact on Thor, Odin and Loki, it felt rushed. And there were too many clues towards the somewhat forced twist at the end, which made the reveal obsolete.Also, it was a little too much of plot convenience that it was Jane who discovered the evil force Macguffin. And Selvig being a little craycray as an aftereffect from the Tessaract makes you wonder how Hawkeye fares these days.Other than that: it was all a great roller coaster ride. Especially the final fight, which was both personal and still had multiple worlds at stake. It also featured really fast paced interdimensional traveling that felt like a more crazy episode of Phineas and Ferb - but due to a good set-up never got you to loose the suspension of disbelief.So, without any (mentionable) spoilers... this is Thor: the Dark World for you. Epic and Awesome...",8,0,3,5 December 2013
Deadpool," All you could want from a Deadpool movie
","This review is going to be short. Because words cannot describe what this movie is. From the opening credits, to the post-credits scene (if you could call it that), this movie was brilliant.Any reader of the Deadpool comic will agree that this is what a Deadpool movie should be. Characters are handled in a Deadpool way, the romantic subplot is handled in a Deadpool way, the action, you name it.Also, the camera-work was good. They held the darn thing still, so you could actually see what was going on. More action movies should do that. Have you ever noticed from my reviews that I hate shaky cam? Well I do.As for this movie. I can't describe what it is, but I love it! It is unlike anyy movie ever made. And it's great!",10,6,18,14 February 2016
