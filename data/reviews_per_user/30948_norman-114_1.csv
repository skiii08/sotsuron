Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," US and A peeps!
","Cohen is a Jewish British comedian of the highest caliber (spelt incorrectly so Americans can understand) whose brilliance lies in his ability to offend everybody who is offend-able.The thing is some people are more offend-able than others and it is those people who make his three character creations so blindingly funny and of course so inaccessible to the morons he is offending. Borat: A raging, politically incorrect,chauvinist,boorish,third-world,over sexed, anti-Semite,still living in the 16th century?Now what could possibly be funny about that?, or the pretension that somehow American people are worldly & sophisticated?Hahahaha! Hiyh Five! Happy time no?",8,5,14,18 October 2006
