The Young Victoria," Sparkling Emily Blunt; Very entertaining/teaching picture.
","And that's why historic/biographic movies are so important to all of us, moreover when they are so well done, like this one!Before I saw 'The Young Victoria', I knew a few things about Queen Victoria, but in the end I got much more knowledge about it. Emily Blunt is simply GREAT as Victoria (Who would guess that!) and She probably will get a nomination at this years Oscar's. Personally, I'm cheering for her...For technical issues, I am pleased to say that is a very successful production, with wonderful Art Direction/Set Decoration and, of course, like It was expected to be, a terrific periodic Costume Design! The one drawback is that I want to see more and know more about this interesting queen, but foremost, incredible woman and mother! BRAVO: 9 out of 10!",9,10,14,13 January 2010
Mary and Max," Make a Favour to Yourself and See This Wonderful Animated Feature!
","And It happened!!! I don't know how and why, but 'Mary & Max' incredibly made me cry... I loved it, to the first frame until the last one! Well, this animated picture can not be a PIXAR production or even a American movie, but you can bet this is a stupendous Australian animated feature... I only hope that 'Mary & Max' get some nominations around the world, like it happened with 'Persepolis' or 'Vals Im Bashir', its quite possible it reach the 2010 Oscars... And it would be such a pleasure! The story line is superb, noble and above all it has the ability to describe many rotten realities of our society, so if you didn't see it yet, please, make a favor to yourself and spend a very well done hour lurking this two suffering, sad and nevertheless comic lifes, of an Australian girl and an American middle age man! 'Mary and Max' is not to be missed... 10 out of 10",10,28,37,6 November 2009
