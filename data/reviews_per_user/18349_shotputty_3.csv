Changeling," Horrible
","I watched this film because it had a good IMDb rating. Besides the fact that Angelina Jolie can't really seem to get my attention in any movie for her acting performance this movie is NO FUN for people who have little children of their own. It just made me sick to my stomach to think about the scenario. I honestly cannot believe why so many people like this movie so much.The only thing I got form this movie is the urge to smack some low life people that hurt little children. It's just sick. Afterwards I was wondering if it was based on a true story. Was LAPD as corrupt as in this movie? If so then maybe the rating is based on a political view that such misbehavior should be exposed. Even so, I think it's extremely overrated.",2,5,13,2 March 2011
Creed," Do you even lift?
","We watched this movie in a sauna :-) It's fun to watch but you know what's coming every step of the way. You might have called it Rocky VII. It's a good franchise but that doesn't mean you shouldn't put all you got into making it yet again a superb movie. Stallone is definitely the best actor by far. If there's going to be a sequel with Creed then I would like to see him in the shape Apollo Creed was, 30 pounds heavier.To me the biggest flaw in this movie is how a world champion looks like he visits Mac Donalds more than a gym. He looks scary alright but doesn't seem to have done any push-ups, ever... There are so many possible actors for his role, whey did they choose him?",6,0,1,8 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," This part is all about stalling and making money in the process
","I've anticipated that being the last Harry potter they would divide this part into 2 separate ones (just like with the matrix) while in fact there is no other reason to do so other then make people spend their money twice.I've enjoyed all of the harry potters up until this one. Many scenes are just plain boring with little magic and little conversation, it's actually quite depressing with not much going on.When the movie finally ended I just gazed at the screen thinking: 'did anything funny just happen?'. No. I feel the actors also played on autopilot. It's as if you can tell when someone will react in a way on certain events. I also think there were some parallels with Lord of the rings. Maybe the author ran out of ideas..I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie to anyone. Unfortunately I obligated myself to see part 2. Hope it will make up for this crap.",3,4,5,31 December 2010
