The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," What the hell was that.
","That was the worst movie that I've ever laid my eyes on. The books were somewhat enjoyable, and the first movie was okay. It just all went downhill from there. Bella and Edward scenes were composed only of bad acting and kissing, the two alternating every few seconds. I swear, those sex scenes were way to long and a few seconds would be enough to get the viewers to see the point. Bella just appears as a sex-craving teenager throughout the whole first half of the movie. The wolf scenes were a joke. I don't think anyone could've possibly taken those seriously. The way those scenes were described in the book was so detailed and emphasized, all thrown aside in the movie. I don't remember anything about the wolves attacking the vampires at all, but I guess somehow there was a reason to put it in there. Bottom line, the movie was utterly horrible, though most viewers will continue to Part Two; half are haters who want to continue hating, half are fans who want more. Whatever happens, there will always be someone around to see the next part. I'd rather not be part of that crowd.",1,5,6,4 February 2012
