Howl's Moving Castle," Yet another breathtaking film from Miyazaki!
","This movie is breathtaking! One of Miyazaki's best films ever (almost on par with Spirited Away which is my favorite anime film ever, and on par with Kiki's Delivery Service which is my second favorite Miyazaki film). The animation is stunning. Everything including the decor of the homes, the people and buildings in the cities, and characters especially are are guilty of taking your imagination and letting it run wild while you watch this film. The attention that Hayao Miyazaki put into Howl and Sophie with their personalities and flaw are very compelling, especially Howl. He is one of my favorite male characters from Miyazaki's work (I also really like Haku from Spirited Away they are both very relatable). Sophie is also one of my favorite female characters from Miyazaki's work as well (I have a huge crush on her, but I pretty much have one on all of the other female characters from Miyazaki's work, except the sisters from My Neighbor Totoro. I didn't really like that film). Overall this film is amazing. Practically perfect! I would give it a 12, but alas I can't. Here is my complete list of top Anime films of all time. http://www.imdb.com/list/G7lvVZJ1qJ0/",10,1,2,23 February 2014
Spirited Away," The best Anime movie out there, also best Miyazaki film!
","I have to say this first, I am a huge Hayao Miyazaki fan, and this film is his best. I also really like Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl's Moving Castle, and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, but Spirited Away beats them all. I fist watched this film in 2012 and I regret not watching it sooner in life, as I am a movie goer. I am 17 years old now and I still think that this is one of the most sophisticated film ever. Spirited Away does as the title intends to do with yours. I was lifted into the dazzling world full of complex thoughts and characters. The characters in this film are so well formed and developed. My favorites have to be Haku, Chihiro, Yubaba, and Lin. The animation in this film is spectacular, some of the best hand drawn animation ever. I can see myself watching this movie with my kids in the future or just watching it by myself to reflect on life. If I could give this movie a 12 I would, but I can not. Spirited Away is a must watch. IT'S AMAZING. Here are some of my lists: http://www.IMDb.com/list/G7lvVZJ1qJ0/ -best anime http://www.IMDb.com/list/Cy-LrrcUV_Y/ -best animated movies (anime included)",10,1,2,30 January 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," This movie is Amazing, stop hating
","I don't know why so many people are expressing their hate on this movie so much. I loved the first one, and I even admitted that is was boring at time, but I don't see what everyone hates about this movie. The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is the best movie (in my opinion) in The Lord of the Rings franchise, with The Return of the King and An Unexpected Journey second and third (here is my full list http://www.imdb.com/list/khL__E4rlxY/). When Smaug finally showed himself, I was literally scared to dead, his magnificence and enormity was so well captured in this movie I went to see it a second time. In conclusion, this movie is an unbelievable improvement from the last one. An all around great and amazing film, so stop hating please(but to each his own).",10,3,10,11 January 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," One of the best films EVER!
","First things first, I am a huge LOTR fan, and a love all of them (even The Hobbit films). I have read all the books and they are one of my favorites (as The Hobbit is my favorite book of all time). LOTR in general are my favorite movie franchise of all time. They all are so well written and directed, but the best of them all (in the Lord of the Rings films as I liked The Desolation of Smaug more by a hair) is Return of the King. Return of the King had the best battle scenes and the best cinematography and acting in it, although they were all well acted. Return of the King, to me, had the best visual effects and the best 'bad ass' parts. When Eowyn and Merry take down the Witch King of Angmar, that was one of the best scenes in a movie ever. All in all I can't fathom the love and compassion that I have for this film, if I could give it a 12 I would, but alas I cant. RETURN OF THE KING IS AMAZING. YOU HAVE TO WATCH ALL OF THEM, ESPECIALLY RETURN OF THE KING.",10,1,2,22 January 2014
