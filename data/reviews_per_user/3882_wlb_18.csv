The King's Speech," A wonderful movie - Educational, inspirational and a Must See
","I believe this is the only movie I have given a '10' to - perhaps one other. There are so many levels and angles one could use to describe this movie.One could take pity on a man for whom most of the world would believe had it 'comfortable' - particularly in the background of the Great Depression - but one learns early that 'Mr. Johnson' had his own deep problems and unlike most of us had to alternative but to face them head on.When I saw his 2 young daughters history suddenly came alive for me, realizing that they were Elizabeth and Margaret.There is some dry British humor when the speech therapist asks 'Mrs. Johnson' if her husband can avoid speaking engagements.History comes alive in this movie that is entertaining, educational and inspirational.I left the theater believing George VI was a man who had a terrible handicap to overcome and through humility and guts, did so while leading Britain through her most terrible period.This is easily the best movie I have seen in some years.",10,4,8,28 January 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Bizarre and a wonderful fiction of alternative history
","I went to this movie with some trepidation but seeing it well reviewed in places I trust like Big Hollywood gave me hope. Everyone has raved about the performance of Christoph Waltz; it is deserved. He plays the stereotypical SS officer to the hilt. Evil with death imminent but so polite and courteous.Like Kill Bill I found myself laughing in places my mind was telling me I shouldn't be laughing. But I wasn't alone with most of the audience laughing.I felt the middle the movie was a bit slow - but don't wish to give examples and spoilers so you be the judge - but all in all a thoroughly enjoyable movie and one whose ending was an alternative history and given the pure evil of Nazi ideology one could only say 'if only'...I can also say that this is the first Brad Pitt movie that I have enjoyed.Because of all the graphic violence, it's not a movie I would take small children to, though.",8,1,6,23 August 2009
Black Book," Not your typical war movie
","It's a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat - right to the end.Some of the characters you think are 'good' turn out to be bad and at least one whom you think is bad turns out to be good. If this were a book you would call it a 'page turner' reading until early in the morning. I was also reminded of the fact that in Holland and France there were more than a few traitors who profited by the Nazi occupation.I originally saw it in our Tower Theater, which specializes in 'art' films. Right next door Tower Records was started...I have just bought the DVD. I was told that it cost $16 Million to make which, given the sets and acting talent (and screen writing) seems unbelievable here. I doubt that this could have been made in Hollywood for less 5x that amount. Many of our own (spoiled) stars turn down individual salaries more than that. Paul has created a masterpiece and I am smitten with Carice. Sebastion Koch also had an excellent performance.",8,2,4,28 May 2007
Dear John," A story of love and commitment
","Based on a recommendation I went to see this movie a few hours ago. Have to say it captured the pain of love with someone who is on active duty in the military - commitment, not only to to your loved one but your duty as a serviceman in a time of peril.The theme of commitment runs in 3 paths - to one's loved one, to one's duty and to those whose family members need care.I thought it was a beautiful movie and in staying for the credits (a trick that a friend of mine, a movie connoisseur, taught me) - co-star Amanda Seyfried is multi-talented having sung in some of the movie's soundtracks.One of the posters here expressed disappointment in the movie; having read the book. Each to his own, my opinion is certainly no better or worse than the others, but in my humble opinion, movies based on best selling books rarely run in perfect parallel; those movies that do follow a book 100% in the screenplay can be disappointing (Flags of our Fathers is one example for me).I think most people would enjoy the movie.",8,18,35,2 March 2010
We Are Marshall," A movie that needs no dramatization - was accurate
","I spent many summers with my aunt, uncle and cousin in Huntington, WV and was at the University of Virginia in Nov 1970 when the plane carrying most of Marshall's football team crashed. It crashed just a few miles from their home.While my school was 300 miles from Huntington many weekends I'd make the trip to Huntington to see my aunt & uncle. Just a week before the accident my uncle and I saw one of their games - a home game playing Kent State - and it was such an eerie feeling for me to know that virtually everyone I saw on the field that day was gone in an instant.I don't think it would be possible for any director to truly capture the level of grief in Huntington at that time, but this movie gave a pretty good glimpse inside.While this movie is about the rebuilding of a football team that all but vanished, the greater message to me is how they kept building through their intense grief, and why that effort was important.Almost everyone in my circle knew someone - or had a loved one - killed. A poster mentioned that some in Huntington don't like the film - everyone I know - including my cousin, felt that it really captured the time.The Huntington Quarterly devoted an issue to describe the making of the movie, and how the actors met - and mingled - with members of the community. I believe that the community embraced the production crew.Kate Mara's character, according to my cousin, is a composite of several actual individuals and the restaurant has a different name but everything else is factual. Incidentally I loved Kate's character.Matthew McConaughey has said that it is the most meaningful movie he has done.I have recommended it to all my friends.",9,12,13,1 January 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," I have a different take on this from most reviewers
","I have to say as a male - and approaching the fashion industry as Anne Hatheway's character did - thinking she was 'apart' from it - a bit of dialogue from Meryl Streep's character was really an education for me.Anne's character, 'Andrea', snickers when a model, selecting 2 belts for Streep's character, saying that she 'still has to learn this stuff'.What follows from Streep's character is some of the most powerful dialog I have seen on the screen.Addressing the innocuous sweater that Andrea is wearing, Miranda Priestly then goes into the history of the color of her sweater - not 'blue' but 'cerulean' when the color was unveiled, how it filtered down from the designers to the department stores and finally ' where you fished it out of some bargain bin in some Casual Corner'.'So It's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when in fact - you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of 'stuff'.Having seen back-to-back Streep movies Julie and Julia - now this - I can see why she is so revered as an actress.As to the movie it is funny and for a relatively fashion-ignorant guy, educational.Most of us have all had a 'boss from Hell' and it is funny to see how Andrea handles this as it unfolds.",8,2,4,24 April 2010
Rush," A Great Movie for F1 Fans and non-F1 Fans
","I was waiting for this movie to appear for several months, ever since it was mentioned in Road & Track magazine.Really the only 2 great racing films are, in my opinion, John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix (1966) and Steve McQueen's LeMans (1971).This movie makes 3.I do like Senna that came out in 2010, but in my opinion it's more of a documentary on the late racing great Ayrton Senna.So 40 years later comes another racing movie. The difference between this move and the previous 2 is that racing is really a backdrop to the clash of 2 very different personalities who came to respect each other.In one professional interview with Niki Lauda the UKs Guardian I believe, it was suggested that Hunt was Lauda's foil - I agree but if it is possible from a screen writing perspective Lauda was also a foil for Hunt.It has been said that the film highlights Lauda - I don't agree - it highlights the both with their contrasts.To me - even more than Lauda's brilliant driving, I will always remember him for his courage after his accident (hardly a spoiler alert since this is common knowledge).In Road & Track's interview with Ron Howard, Howard detailed the effort that he went to insure that this was an accurate portrayal - consulting people directly involved from Lauda himself to Ron Dennis and a dozen others.It has, from what I understand, been well received in the F1 community.Above all it is a fantastic film on 2 very different personalities and how they came to respect each other.",9,4,6,30 September 2013
Knowing," Could have had a better ending
","I saw this movie with a friend who is a movie nut - can tell you snippets of dialogue from a movie he saw 10 years ago - after the movie we agreed that (a) the premise was good and (b)the reason for the premise was, ugh, pretty far out.The futurist, who as a child in an elementary school in 1959, wrote her predictions in a numeric form. I guess you could say that she was a modern-day Nostradamus ;-) For me the movie was enjoyable for the first 75% then it got a bit silly...I can think of 2 or 3 ways to have written the script so that it would either be more believable or have a mysterious end.However it was entertaining - worth seeing once...",7,1,4,22 March 2009
Cars," A Must See if you are a Car Nut
","I am not usually attracted to animation features (the last one I saw was Toy Story) but Cars had so much pre-publicity in my car magazines - Road & Track, Automobile - one article even dealt with getting Porsche's approval for Bonny Hunt's 'character', well, I had to see it.What impressed me most was the attention to detail. While I am not a rabid NASCAR fan even I know Richard Petty's Plymouth number 43 (voiced by the King himself) , and while watching this animation can easily see why NASCAR is so popular. The engine sounds were so realistic & matched to the vehicles. CAUTION: If you miss even 15 seconds of dialogue you'll miss a clever pun. Even the motel in the movie is a clever take off on Rt 66's famous Wigwam Motel.There are no people in the movie - only cars and other vehicles. It is a world of talking vehicles.And they cleverly made the cars movement believable using a lot of suspension travel.The car's voices were so well matched to the car models! Cheech Marin is the voice of a low rider 59 Chevy Impala, a cameo by Arnold Schwartzenegger with an H1 Hummer, Michael Schumacher in what else but a Ferrari, and George Carlin in a 60s VW Van complete with peace symbols. Richard Petty was the Plymouth of course. Paul Newman is the wise old Hudson Hornet. Speaking of detail the Hudson's blue color was an actual Hudson color according to one of the magazine articles. Can a Porsche Carrera find true happiness with a NASCAR race car? Does a particular NASCAR race car find the true meaning of life? You'll have to watch the movie. Bill",9,5,6,16 June 2006
The Lives of Others," Gives a realistic glimpse of life in the former DDR
","I can't really add a lot to what the others have said, except to say for me it gave a realistic glimpse into what was life in the former East Germany. A German friend told me in 1992 that if I wanted to see 'East Germany' I had better do it now because it will vanish quickly (wall came down in 1989). And so I went.The best analogy someone told me about leave East Germany for West Germany was 'watching a black & white movie that suddenly becomes color' The bleak scenes (filmed much on Karl Marx Allee I'm told) all added to the realism. Then we see how the people are treated - in this instance, artists. One sees how the all-powerful Stasi and Ministers used their power corruptly (without giving any spoilers) The best description I can give of life in the DDR through this movie would be 'soul destroying'.And yet one member of the Stasi found redemption.It was a very powerful and memorable movie. I told another German friend about this and he said he would wait to buy the DVD. Fine, I told him, but this also deserves a view on the big screen. I recommend this to everyone....",9,1,3,14 March 2007
Gran Torino," Good writing, acting & no special effects made a grand movie
",I have seen this movie twice now. The first time (yesterday) I missed the 1st 10-15 minutes and heard that it had so much in had to see it today. And today I picked up yet another theme for Clint's character: redemption.This is the way they used to make grand movies - good writing and a minimum of special effects.In both of my viewings The audience was laughing at the 'political incorrectness' - some have compared that aspect to Blazing Saddles. Without spoiling the plot one realizes that Eastwood's character has a good heart despite his outward appearances.If you see one movie this year make it Gran Torino.,8,1,3,14 January 2009
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Evil as seen though the eyes of innocent children
","Of all my reviews, I believe that this is the first '9' I have given a film. I do not know the mechanics of the film business and distribution, but I had been hearing 'buzz' and radio advertisements about this film for the last 30 days, and it wasn't until recently that it opened in only 2 theaters (25 miles apart) in all of metropolitan Sacramento.The film affected me on several levels- one of which how a nice 'family man' could become an SS commandant over a concentration camp. The father was happily married with an 8 year old boy and 12 year old girl.And the family (wife and mother in law) had some conversations that I am sure resonated in at least a few German family households during that era. The father justified his work with the rationalization heard over history with genocide that 'they aren't really people'.I will have to say that given the usual mindless entertainment on the silver screen this movie will stay with you.The main theme of the movie is how 2 innocent 8 year old boys are affected by evil, and man's inhumanity to man.I had heard some detractors say that all of the 'Germans' are speaking with English accents, including the American actress Vera Farmiga (I suppose to stay consistent with the other British actors) - their contention that somehow this detracts from the authenticity. The acting and the script takes you to wartime Germany, with whatever accents the actors are using. That is the best compliment that I can give. One of the year's best, in my opinion.",9,14,25,23 November 2008
The Dark Knight," A Summer Blockbuster with a decent plot
",This summer I was disappointed seeing the Indiana Jones sequel (Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) - to me just recycled bits and pieces from Raiders.The Dark Knight is one of the best I have seen this year - and Sir Michael Caine was spot-on saying that Heath Ledger's final performance as the Joker - one really saw a psychopath and not a mischievous clown in this character.I thought Christian Bale's performance was spectacular - and although Michael Caine - one of my favorite actors - had but a few lines they were great. Which goes to the saying that 'There are no small parts; only small actors'.'Blockbusters' usually have tons of hype with mediocre execution; this was an exception. I'll bet since Jaws maybe 10 -less than 10 - in 30+ years have kept the audience riveted with the plot and acting - this is one addition.,9,2,6,27 July 2008
Taken," Makes Jack Bauer look like a girl scout
","This movie keeps you riveted from the time of the kidnapping. Before, as Brian, a divorced father, is trying to reconcile with his daughter, he can only tell her that he used to 'work for the government' (as indeed, a friend who lives near Langley said he has a bunch of neighbors who 'work for the government'.About all Brian reveals to his daughter is that he used to 'prevent bad things from happening'.He reluctantly gives his daughter permission to 'go to Paris' with her friend, and like most 17 year olds then ignores all of his warnings and admonitions.Liam's character is a lot more believable than a Jason Bourne or James Bond - he is just a concerned father trying to save his daughter - who happens to have accrued some special skills.I guarantee that you will not be bored or leave early with this movie...",8,1,2,1 February 2009
The Great Raid," Based on the book Ghost Soldiers (a true story)
","Sometimes the truth is better than any made-for-Hollywood script. This movie is about an untested Ranger Battalion who volunteered to go miles behind enemy lines on Luzon and rescue the remnants of starved American POWs.It left a small part of the book out - how an advanced scout group was able to sneak in right under the Japanese to give an intel report.But a few hundred Rangers were able to go 30 miles behind enemy lines - come in under night cover - sneak across 800 yards of cleared area around 10,000 Japanese to rescue these men.This movie certainly honors those soldiers - about a battle that was hardly known to the country before the book was published.It also honored an American nurse who stayed in Manila - worked with the Philippine underground and smuggled in medicine saving 100s of lives in the concentration camp. And it is a all true history - the closing credits show films of the actual characters.",8,4,6,12 October 2007
The Wrestler," Neither loved it nor hated it
",Obviously I am missing something that the critics find so appealing. The film centers around an aging wrestler who has over the years alienated his daughter from never being there for her.The film shows his rather gritty life combined with the punishment his body takes.Rather than give you a 100% spoiler and detail why I think his character is a schmuck I will simply say that he blew it with his daughter and Marisa's character...It wasn't a terrible movie - it was entertaining - but I definitely went away with a different message the screenwriter wanted me to have...See it and judge for yourself...,5,8,15,18 January 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Even if you know little of the background; you'll like this movie
","I went to this movie not expecting much; more to accommodate my friend who insisted on seeing it. By the end I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of (a) the cinematography (showing an 1880s London the way I would imagine it), (b) the acting of all concerned, and (c) the screenplay.Robert Downey played a masterful Holmes and Jude Law was great as Dr Watson. Since the days of Mrs Henderson Presents I have been smitten by Kelley Riley, who played Mary Marston. It involves a bit of your intellect; even if you can't figure out Holmes' logic as the movie unfolds he will explain it for you at the end.Go see this movie; you should enjoy it. There is a lot of mindless cinematic entertainment out there; this movie is not in that category.",8,2,5,1 January 2010
Valkyrie," Surprisingly good
","I have to admit I came to the movie with a Tom Cruise bias. A friend of mine who is also a movie nut - and I agreed that in almost every Cruise movie he has to run away from an explosion of some kind.That being said, I had to brave a traffic jam in Sacramento (on a Saturday even) and missed the North Africa sequence, about the first 8-10 minutes of the movie I heard.All that being said from what I do know of my WW2 history this was technically accurate. Of course unlike the usual thrillers one knows the outcome beforehand, but it was nevertheless an attention-riveting movie.I finished a good book on Rommel, and he is not mentioned anywhere in the movie. I do know that he was implicated in the plot, and I believe he was to be installed in the 'new' govt to negotiate with the allies. Rommel was one of the few Nazi generals respected by the allies, not only for his tactical brilliance in North Africa and France (I view him as a German Robert E. Lee), but his humane treatment of allied prisoners - against Hitler's orders - in North Africa. He was forced to commit suicide because of his involvement in the plot, although he took no part in the planning; only a passive involvement.Also while there were many brave Germans involved in this plot - I read somewhere that 5,000 were killed by the Nazis in the aftermath - one does not get a feel for the widespread and terrible repercussions in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised that his wife Nina and her children survived and Nina died only in 2006.A historian said of this plot that it was 'too little and too late'. It would be easy (and futile) to speculate what would have happened had it succeeded - Roosevelt and Churchill agreed on a principle of 'unconditional surrender' - in part to keep Stalin from making his separate peace - although Churchill (and many German officers admitted later) that with nothing to lose, it meant that Germans would continue the futility of fighting with many needless deaths after D-Day.That being said, I still enjoyed the movie. Didn't want to wait the 45 minutes for the restart to see the North Africa sequence so I will probably get it on the DVD.",8,2,4,10 January 2009
