Blade Runner 2049," Powerful, honors the original
","Let me get this out of the way: the film is simply stunning visually. They did a masterful job of bringing the mystique of the first film to life in full HD without sacrificing the integrity of the original's look and feel. Strong performances from the main actors leave the viewer engrossed in the film from start to finish. Subtle yet powerful twists take place that leave you questioning your emotions about character throughout the film. Once of the things that this film gets a lot of credit for in my book is successfully creating a story that the viewer can care about as a sequel to the original Blade Runner. There was a lot to manage here and I feel that they did a near masterful job of pulling it off. This film is absolutely worth seeing and is one of the more underrated movies of the year in my opinion. The film is even more impressive when watched directly after a viewing of the original Blade Runner as you get to appreciate just how successfully they recreated this world. It's newer and shinier than the original but it feel just as gritty, hopeless and bleak. This is a must watch for all Sci Fi fans and fans of the original film.",8,0,2,28 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Painfully Bad
","This is NOT Star Wars. The script was painfully bad and the entire film felt like a soulless Disney cash grab. In what feels like a wild attempt to differentiate itself, The Last Jedi borders on being unrecognizable as a StarWars installment. Major questions from The Force Awakens are completely neglected and character development takes a backseat to explosions and jarring 'twists' that don't surprise but rather leave you feeling frustrated and confused. The main problem seems to be that The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi feel completely incompatible with one another, as if the directors were in a fued. All of the questions posed by The Force Awakens are deliberately neglected throughout the film minus a few. The 2.5 hour run time seemed fine before going in as it was assumed the extra time was needed to go deep into the backstory of many of the characters and questions posed by The Force Awakens. Instead it was wasted on pointless subplots and uninteresting characters. It was difficult to sit through the entire film and remain interested. There were also some bizarre moments that completely ruin the ability to take this movie seriously: flying space Leia, green alien breastmilk drinking Luke, tossing the saber over the shoulder, snokes pointless and unrealistic fate. All of these things coupled with the totally out of place humor make this an unenjoyable film. The humor robs the audience of any chance to take the film, The Force or the Jedi, and the villains seriously. Not to mention, it usually misses the mark and is not genuinely funny. It feels forced and out of place. Like a constant self mockery that borders on deliberate trolling of the serious mythos embraces by the fans. 1/10 because they had an easy lay up from Abrams to make a great movie, wasted Mark Hamil, Andy Serkis and Gwendoline Christie (she gets about 2 mins of screen time) and created a soulless and fundamentally bad film with a budget of $300 million+. The interest in the new Star Wars franchise is now significantly reduced and hope for Episode 9 is bleak. Wait to see this one on Netflix.",1,2,3,27 December 2017
Blade Runner," Classic Sci Fi
","A classic Sci Fi that is a must watch for fans of the genre. The film leaves you with an eerie feeling that sticks with you after viewing. Harrison Ford is nails and delivers a powerful performance. The romance between him and Rachel is palpable and they put together some of the best romantic scenes I have ever seen. The film has a powerful message that isn't preachy, but rather nuanced and cautionary. It forces the viewer to examine the human condition.This is one of my all time favorite movies and really stands the test of time well. The story is coherent, the acting superb, the writing is intelligent and the characters are engrossing. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it now.",8,0,1,28 December 2017
