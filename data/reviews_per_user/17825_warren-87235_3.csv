The Lobster," Truly odd, but oddly fascinating
","Having watched The Lobster (oddly enough, following Batman Vs Superman... what a complete difference!), I can honestly say I found it a strangely compelling and enjoyable film. Don't get me wrong, it's truly odd and unusual, and won't be for everyone, but if you like quirky and strange films every bit as much as your blockbusters, you may find this quite enjoyable. Every few minutes, you will find yourself thinking 'What the...?!' but in a good way.I've read some of the one star reviews, and whilst I can't argue with a lot of what they say (it's trite, shallow, emperor's new clothes, etc.), I also think they're missing the point. If you want to look for some deep commentary that satirises modern relationships and gender politics, this is not it. If you look for that, and believe that's what the film is about, then you *will* find it shallow, and an 'Emperor's new clothes' experience (If that's what the creators intended, then yes, they missed the mark).As far as I'm concerned, this isn't a film with any message; this is a dream that has been brought to life with actors. The logic and reality of this world makes no sense, until you place it in the context of a dream, and then everything makes sense, in the same way the strange and unusual does in your own dreams. I don't mean that as an excuse, where anything can be allowed 'because it's a dream', but because the logic, script and reality of the film fit perfectly with how a dream works.What The Lobster ultimately ends up being, is a truly unusual little romance. My one complaint would be the finale. It fails in the way that I think many horror films fail. Horror movie creators all-too-often think that because they're making a horror film, they have to have the protagonist/s almost win, then something bad happens in the very last moments and they lose, which is as clichéd, tired and predictable an ending as a horror movie can have. Likewise, 'art house' films like this, all-too-often have ambiguous ends, that want to 'leave it to the viewer' to decide what happens. Sometimes that can seem forced, just because they want to avoid a 'hollywood', but then they can end up being as predictable and clichéd (in their own right) as the ending they were trying to avoid.The Lobster falls into that trap, at the very final moment, but is otherwise a very different film experience that can be enjoyed in its own context. Having said that, I can completely understand where people are coming from who do not enjoy it. You'll just have to decide for yourself.",7,0,2,30 December 2016
Avengers: Infinity War," Did I watch a different movie?
","Having missed this at the cinema, my other half and I finally got round to buying and watching it (in 3D). Wow... what a mess. I'm glad we didn't pay to see this at the cinema. I'm quite honestly amazed at how many good reviews it's been getting. It's disturbingly close to 'Last Jedi' level bad (but not quite... that would still take some work). There's no real plot to speak of, things just seem to happen 'because', any sense of logic or consistency goes out the window (And that's in comparison to most of the other Marvel movies, which are hardly that great in the logic stakes in the first place!), power levels constantly change to fit a particular scene, rather than match what has been established for characters previously, etc., etc..... To top it all off, after all the build up, Thanos turns out to be one of the least interesting Marvel villains, with face-palm-inducing 'woke' motivation. The only good thing I'll say, is that it manages what most Marvel movies usually manage: the character interaction and banter is fun for the most part, and amusing. Oh, and most of the effects are good (except for Banner pointlessly in the Hulk-buster).I understand and applaud the desire to try an 'Empire Strikes Back', but there are a few big differences (A story, for one). Empire works so well because our heroes get their posteriors kicked. They struggle tooth and nail to survive, and even when they do get a chance to fight they are soundly defeated. Infinity War falls flat, because the villain and his forces never feel particularly strong, and our heroes get repeated opportunities to defeat Thanos and simply don't take them because it would end the film early.To be honest, despite its very obvious flaws (and a certain top lip deserving second billing), I actually found Justice League more enjoyable. I genuinely began falling asleep at the end of Inifinity War and closed my eyes, just listening till the end, I was so bored. Such a shame and a wasted opportunity after the build up of so many movies.",3,5,9,20 September 2018
La La Land," Just 'Okay'
","Honestly, despite the critics I wasn't blown away. I can see why the critics loved it so much, though. It's a heavy handed love-letter to Hollywood musicals and Hollywood history and life. It feels like a film made for L.A. critics rather than the audience. If you take away the musical and directorial elements, the love story is so clichéd (yes, even the 'bittersweet' ending has become a cliché nowadays, when you want to be seen as being different and going against the 'Hollywood ending' and 'embracing gritty, real life')The worst bit wasn't the ending, however. That could be forgiven. the worst bit was the contrived 'Oh, yes, he's too busy with work to see her one-woman play, which spells the end' That was the low point of the movie for me. It was a cringe-worthy plot contrivance that's been done a million times, and usually not in so heavy handed a way. Damien Chazelle seems capable of writing the 'happier' bits well enough, because he can fall back on his love of cheerful/colourful musicals, but the more dramatic elements felt like he relied on the stereotypes and heavy handed symbolism. Oooh, their relationship fails in 'The Fall'? Just when they've had an argument, the smoke alarm goes off, because he's forgotten the meal cooking in the oven, that comes out all burnt and over- done?The songs also feel a little forced, but it makes sense when you watch the making-of, and realise that the music was written first, and other people were brought in to quite literally force lyrics into the music, rather than both being created at the same time. This is a flimsy, cliché-ridden story written to join dance routines and music together.Other than that, it's fun enough and a bit different (if only stylistically). I'll admit I did love some of the filming, and was very impressed by some of the direction. After watching the making-of, and seeing the passion and enthusiasm that went into it, and how someone got to make their dream project, I really wanted to like the movie more. In fact, I actually admire the Hollywood producers who wanted to back something that was a passion- project, rather than something designed purely with the box-office in mind. Unfortunately it all ends up a bit mediocre, unless you're a critic who wants to praise it simply for being a love-letter to the superior Hollywood musicals that inspired it. This is for musical lovers, what Jupiter Ascending is for action movie lovers. Great visuals and design, some amazing direction, some good actors get roped in, and... That's about it. You come away neither disappointed nor elated.",6,3,5,21 May 2017
