Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," BORAT'S an Insult!
","I went to see the FREAK that made millions on being the Biggest Bigoted Freak on SCREEN!!!! I'm quite politically incorrect myself but not to insult/hurt anyone. I've seen a few interviews of 'BORAT' himself on TV & He's just plain retarded ( reminded me of Jerks in High School & College.) This is what N. America & the U.K. Love - Freaks & Losers! Well, this tells me a lot about the Culture (if any) here.If he wants to say something about the Pethatic Social decline of America at least have some respect & formality. I definitely don't recommend Parents showing this movie to Kids they'll grow up to be just Trash!",2,5,10,14 November 2006
Cloverfield," I'm so disappointed...
","I thought for Oonce Hollywood finally creates it's own incredible Monster sci-fi Movie... All I can tell you is I got so nauseous (The whole movie was filmed in the frantic fashion of a Camcorder) bring a barf bag. Still I have no idea of what the @#*#@... happened, what was that thing running around Manhattan/central Park? What mysteries? - Cause there were none? This Movie is purposely marketed to the 'You Tube' generation ------- 'Let's watch this Super long movie clip, it'll get me like Wow - On a wild ride...' Who cares about the ending, as long as I get a joy ride out of it who needs an ending? People walked out of the theater either looking for a barf bag or they're numb.... This is how i describe this movie ' A very unsatisfying roller coaster ride that went no where...' All they want is your cash $$$$$...",1,11,24,19 January 2008
