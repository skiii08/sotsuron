The Blair Witch Project," a letdown
","If only...if only they'd hired better actors, or even competent ones.  If only Heather Donahue had done her job, done some research, and known what the Blair Witch was.  If only the movie  makers had thought about plot development, and followed through on their beautiful premise.  The only accident worth the hype this movie has gotten is a single scene of a terrified child trying to prevent her mother from speaking about the Blair Witch.  If only the movie had lived up to that potential of terror.",1,7,11,16 August 1999
