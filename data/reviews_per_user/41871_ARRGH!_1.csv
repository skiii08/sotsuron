The Blair Witch Project," There has never been anything like it. Honestly.
","I'm not the kind to just write haphazard reviews just so people can see my wonderful opinion online. I have to really believe in the film to get myself to write about it. Remember the movie 'Crazy People' with Dudley Moore? It was a comedy about truth in advertising. There was a film in that film called 'The Scream' which had the tag line 'This movie won't just scare you. It will F**k you up for life'. That line shoulda been used for this film. This is THE REAL THING. It's the most well structured, incredibly well executed film I've seen in years (hell, maybe ever). After a title card explaining what we are about to witness, the entire film is made up of 'Raw' camera footage from both a 16mm movie camera and a hi-8 video camera discovered a year after the events on the media. The footage relates the story of 3 student filmmakers hiking through the woods of Maryland, seeking out sites of gruesome mutilations by a mythical Blair Witch. Things go bad, then worse and then indescribably horrible as they lose their way deeper into the woods all the while being stalked by something that may or may not be human.The actors are first rate. It's not easy to describe the ease which the actors pull the audience in with their performances. On one hand, I'd like to see these performers move on to deserved better things, but at the same time, I'd like never to see them in another film... just to bolster the illusion of this film.There is not a drop of blood spilled, nor is there any background music to be heard. That's right. NO MUSIC! This film is the only one I can recall that can scare without the use of musical Stings or excessive bloodletting. That in itself is an achievement. Sound effects carry a lot of the tension and fear, but it's what the movie DOESN'T visually show that is the most terrifying.This film won't be for everyone. The narrative and camera style might throw people off. The fact that this isn't a film you can dismiss with a laugh might throw others off. Let them stick with their ultra hip 'Scary Movies' (I loathe that term). This is THE REAL THING.",10,1,2,2 July 1999
