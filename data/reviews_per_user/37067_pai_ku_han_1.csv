The Incredible Hulk," Expected more
","Even though the storyline was better, more credible and comic truthful than the 1st one, things i didn't like of the film: -Buce is working in a bottleup factory in brazil. How did he get there? How did he get his working visa. He sure didn't get there by plain, coss the have gamma sensors in airports + they were looking for him.-Bruce is a scientist and becomes a specialist avoiding migrations and USA special forces from 1 day to the other.-How they link the bottle being contaminated with gamma with HULK, that was too far fetched. I don't buy that.-How does he get from Guatemala to USA without clothes nor money??? -The abbomination character is too weak.-Once they trap bruce and they are flying in the helicopter... why don't they lock him up?? they been looking for him all over the world and they didn't even handcuff him (even though they are useless). They should have used a sleeping dart.-The same happens when Hulk beats the abbomination... they let him lie there... waiting for it to wake up and keep killing people.. i don't think military are so stupid. In the film the General says: ohh.. 'soldier lock him up' i would say: sleep him now!! sedate and anesteciate asap!! its the only way to cantain it..",Null,2,6,16 June 2008
