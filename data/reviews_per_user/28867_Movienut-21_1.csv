Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow, It was very very good
","I liked it soo much because it was something completely different and gave me an idea how everything started. Even though i hate the sci-fi section. This was NOO sci-fi this was star wars it can't be defined in the same category as star trek, and babylon 5 and other junk of that nature. Natalie Portman did an excellent job playing a queen, and Ewan Mcgregor also did very well playing the young obi-wan-kanobi. the way he carried himself fits seamlessly with the older obi-wan. Liam Neeson was well chosen for the part, very well chosen. If other movie directors followed their imaginations and their hearts like George Lucas did? Movie Quality would go through the roof.May the Force Be With You! :)",10,0,0,23 May 1999
