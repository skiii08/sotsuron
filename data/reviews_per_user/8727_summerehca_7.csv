The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," First and Last Hunger Games Movie I Will Ever Watch on the Big Screen
","Watched the movie today and sadly it didn't add up to my expectations, and the hype that everyone was making. It is very dull. They wasted great actors like Julianne Moore. The whole movie is just all over the place. I think there was only one arrow shot. They didn't even show the cinematic effect of the bombing of the rebel base. Just some reaction of the actors-- not enough. I'd like to remember some scenes while doing this review, but none really stood out, just the face of Katniss with a confused face.Really, this was the first from the HG franchise that I watched on the big screen, expecting it to be y'know, better than the first 2. But, nah I'll just keep on remembering the scenes from Guardians of the Galaxy and looking forward to The Battle of the Five Armies.",3,43,71,21 November 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Brilliant!!
","I have never watched any of the X-Men movies in the big screen in the past. This was my first, and risked to watch in 3D, not knowing what to expect. Hell yeah, if I wished I had more popcorn in Godzilla to fight yawning, this time I totally forgot I had one. James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, Jenn Lawrence, Ellen Paige , Peter Dinklage and Patrick Stewart were believable in their characters. Not too far behind were the supporting cast, esp Booboo :). Hugh was just Wolverine and that's enough for me. The sentinels were excellent made, esp the modern ones. The early models were just alright, in consideration with the year it was made. The time jump sequences were very fluid. Not one bit did I come up with a question, why or how. It even linked the behaviors and plot in the past. The story was narrated flawlessly, with impressive acting. The effects were excellent. The fights and action scenes were perfectly placed. The script also revealed wit (esp with Peter/Quicksilver, the theater was just so loud with that one :D )Kids will also enjoy this as there's not a lot of gory blood or profanities. Just make sure to explain to them Wolverine's backside lol. The values were also on point. The morals were expressed in a way where one can relate, without sounding cheesy.PLEASE WATCH IT!!! THE FILM AND THE ACTORS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DIRECTOR'S LEGAL CONCERNS. JUST WATCH THE MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS A BRILLIANT MOVIE.Next HTTYD 2 and T4AOE",10,1,2,24 May 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Excellent Movie Without Gimmicks
","Just watched it today and the anticipation from the last couple of months, weeks, days were all so worth it. The movie will let you bring out all emotions, even those you have not even experienced yet, whatever it is. I am very much happy I've seen this on it's first showing date and with my siblings. The message about caring and protecting your family and the ones you love and the ones who need it most will hit you right in the heart. The comic reliefs were intelligently placed, especially those that are happening in the background while another scene is being played. TIP: Watch out also for those dragon antics when the humans are interacting. You'll notice this in the first few scenes where everything in the frame is real busy. You won't even feel it but you'll be able to just magically see these until the last part of the movie. Don't hesitate to point at the dragons. Lol, in the theatre where we watched this, everyone's seen doing this at least once. Don't worry, they won't get annoyed :)It's just sad that there was a death in the movie, I didn't see this coming. Almost everyone, sniffed and brought out tissues in this scene. It was simple, yet there were a lot of emotions that will make you feel sad. One - when you try to shoo a friend, blame a friend, lose a family, and then realize you lost a friend at what you just did. One very outstanding sequence was the Alpha at Berk. Boy the Night Fury really lived up to his status. The blue luminescence of Toothless was so emotionally uplifting, better than the rendition of the blue atomic breath of Godzilla. Add to that the narration in the background- 'He's protecting Hiccup, He's protecting the dragons, he's challenging the Alpha.' (something like that, we were almost at the edge of our seats with this one). Prior to that, we thought there was another death, but lo, a super saiyan type of change happened to Toothless. The battle scene was like classic David and Goliath, but was beautifully interpreted as their own. Eret (Kit Harrington) was entertaining here. His character was also very beautifully built right from his first appearance. ROFL really on Ruffnut's interest in him. Overall, just watch it. The film doesn't need gimmicky press releases like from Godzilla or X men or any previous movie shown this year. (The prankster in America F's dress not included.) This is great quality.",10,8,15,11 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," I am not asking you to like it, I'm just saying I did
","First, to address the critics-Emotionally Vacant- I watched this on HFR 3D and I felt most of the emotions the actors are trying to convey. Though of course, you can't expect much from extras. But the main characters were spot on.HFR didn't work- I agree on some minor scenes, but not all. They worked perfectly well for me on all battle scenes and on major character interactions. Missing Story Plots/Incomplete- I don't know what movie some are telling about, but the film I saw last night had all the closures I was looking for. (Loved the scenes where Tauriel, Thranduil and Legolas were confronting each other, and finally when Thranduil's shows his soft spot, not only for his son, but also for the captain of his army)There are lots more but these are the ones I find myself resolved. When I watched Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings some years back, I knew the series will be epic. Every movie I saw was always an improvement of the previous. The Hobbit series was no exception. Although I took time realizing that this was not going to be the same with the LOTR trilogy, it should start on its own. And it did, when I have accepted that this preceded the first 3 movies, I understood a different story telling. One cannot compare movies or series that are entirely different from the other, much less, one which would tell the history of the first.There are many scenes that I just can't get over with that keeps replaying in my head. Bard using his son to kill Smaug, Thorin's bout with gold sickness, Galadriel's outrage, the nine and Saruman's fighting sequence (Saruman was really bad a$$ here), Thranduil asking Bilbo to confess about stealing the keys to his dungeon, Elven King's smirk that signaled his archers to position (yes a simple smirk- everyone in the theater said 'ohh' here)... and the elk's heroic charge (not mentioning a spoiler here).There are lot's more. Just a fitting finale for the 3 Hobbit movies. Only issue I have is editing. There were minor transitions that are just 'naahh'. Overall, it is your personal preference if you like it in 3D, 3DHFR or just he good old classic digital. If you ask me, I'll watch it in all formats. Can't wait for the DVD and the extended cuts, plus production gag reels. 'But now comes the day.. To bid you farewell..'",10,16,31,12 December 2014
Godzilla," Undeniably so-so
","From a Godzilla fan, to date, I liked the 1998 version. The story was solid, and there were 'moments' to remember (even how silly them were). This version doesn't have that. There are a lot of non facts, especially with the military protocols, details of the radioactive war-heads (they were supposed to be fragile?? duh.. Monsters chomping on the missiles??) And Godzilla was not, well scary.. He looks cute.. and the other monsters, they are confusing. I laughed when the female put the last nuclear warhead near her... eggs... And know what the scene when Godzilla breathed blue beam in the mother MUTO's mouth remind me of - Toothless shooting blue lighting in the boss dragon's mouth (HTTYD 2010).. Just wait for it in DVD, or on TV, for free.",1,8,19,19 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Finally Seen It - Classic!
","After a week of skipping this film (due to other scheds) I finally watched it today. Sadly I didn't get the chance to experience it in IMAX (it would have made me a very very happy cookie). Regardless, the cinematography is just amazing. I also have no complaints (not one in editing- a first!).The characters were (for me) strategically developed- not the traditional way we usually get in most movie scripts. There were moments I kind of murmured wt7? But in the course of the movie, even if there's less talk, I get what it means and say ahhh.. The visuals, the expression of the characters and the way the sequences were shown all somehow relate and I get it :) Unlike other films that had long interactions, but less substance. Enjoyed every bit of it- I even found humor in some acts, especially that guitarist, lololol, and when he finally got tired, and obliterated.Tom Hardy just doesn't fail to amaze. Charlize is just freaking furious (compliment)! and the vehicle action scenes are just wicked. This is 'Fast and Furious' maxed.I disagree on the R16 classification (in my country) though. It's not really gory. I highly recommend the movie. Not a lot of CGI for a change, just natural action epic.",9,5,12,22 May 2015
Furious 7," It's Gonna Be Different From Now On
","Perhaps I find the movie more meaningful because a beloved character left- for good. Though there are scenes that are heartfelt too- including Letty's struggle with her memory, Dom's commitment to protect his family, the unexpected friendship with Mr Nobody, and Brian's intention of building a family.Others may deem the plot cheesy at times, but it worked. Viewers with me on the theater sniffed, not just on the last scene, but on one or more occasions mentioned above. The emotions slowly build up, and in the end.. Please see for yourself. On other aspects of the film, they let the cars work it here, unlike any other film, no narrations about specs etc. With the action, it's pretty much blinding, they were quick and appear to be precise. The actors were well placed, though I felt they could have also given Han a better send out. The locations were also amazing. The Rock and Tyrese were annoyingly entertaining.Saved the best for one last ride.SPOILER-- Shaw Brothers are still alive... there's room for one more..",9,1,2,7 April 2015
