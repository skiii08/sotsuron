Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Sell Out
","The original movie created an excellent formula that should have been taken and used successfully in this sequel. Unfortunately this movie sells out to an American 'Hollywood' audience, and as a result alienates fans of the Sherlock Holmes genre.Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are very entertaining, however Rachel McAdams is painful and brings little to the movie other than the usual fluttering of her eye lashes and clich√© promiscuity.Guy Ritchie seems to be a one trick pony. His directorial techniques have changed little in the 15 years since his 1997 hit Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Obviously, the main difference being the seizable Warner Bros budget now at his disposal.",5,7,12,21 April 2012
