Sucker Punch," This movie is horrible
","Sucker Punch was horrible. I usually like to find the good in movies however this seems impossible. The main character is sent to an insane asylum and is threatened to be lobotomized. The story progression was just all over the place. I mean the protagonist was 'trying to find an escape (freedom)'. What do you mean she should of just had the lobotomy. After seeing this movie I felt like I had just received one and that I was searching for freedom; from the movie theater. I tried to walk out however my ride insisted we watch the movie in its entirety. The sound track was nothing but remakes of older songs that already had remakes to them and all put into depressing atmosphere. The movie has scenes that go into slow-mo when it doesn't even call for it. The entire opening is slow for ten minutes. Also the girls aren't even hot. With the exception for a few, they are pasty, no curved girls that should only be rated as 6s at best. Now I know what most people would say 'well the action scenes were good' No. They weren't. with the exception of the scene where she fights the samurai nothing really wowed me and I was bored with each fight scene. Scott Glen says nothing important and almost anything inspiring that comes out of his mouth is that of a cheesy quote that I'd expect to see on my google homepage. With each 'mission' being as ridiculous as possible to retrieve the most random assortment of items, the guy could have told her to pick up his dry cleaning: 'you'll need a ticket; change; and a receipt'. The movie would have been more realistic if the girls had a more tangible goal like revenge. At the end of the movie they couldn't think of a creative ending for the characters so they kill all the girls and the girl who was a negative Nancy the entire film lives. Good job Zack Snyder you failed at making an interesting movie and congratulations on the raspberry award for worst movie of the year.",1,80,169,27 March 2011
