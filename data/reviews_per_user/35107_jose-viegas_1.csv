First Man," All that is Wrong with this movie!
","First of all, I get it!Everything that is shown in the movie is in sync with what was ok on that era.Ok! I understand that. Now...lets examine the movie.1) Why is the movie only about Neil Armstrong ? What was the purpose ? What does the movie tries to transmit ? I really don't know. OK, I'm not a guy that follows the 'cult of personality', but ok. If the movie is about trying to create a cult around Neil, I understand....but they fail. See who Russians, Communists or even Fascists to it.
2) Why there is no interaction between Neil and Buzz ? It's like Buzz is a passenger on the mission. :(. They never interact during the movie until they are in the same cockpit. Really ?
3) What is the purpose of the movie ? Just watching Neil's wife with her hair cut short in the 60's I immediately knew that she was probably a strong woman. does that shows on the movie ?...not that much. Lame!LAME! the movie is lame! It's not about having the US flag on the movie...it's about the fact that the movie is dysfunctional. 7 out of 10 ? No way! I would give it a 1...but it has good FX effects :).Sorry. But this movie is out of think with reality Oh, we wanted to give a message...really ? What message ?If it was about putting a message to the new generation, I would suggest to the Older Neil to be present and give his opinion based on what if has learned. I know that what is presented is what was reality at that time...but making Buzz like an extra in the movie is too. :(Go back to the story board and make it better:(",2,0,2,1 December 2018
