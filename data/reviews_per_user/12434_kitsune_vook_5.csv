Iron Man 3," What do I hate about this movie?
","I'll make this short, since a lot of guys have explained this over and over... but I seem to have managed to find something new.<ul><li>Jeez Stark, Stop making butter suits!!.. what? they are not made of butter?... then how do you explain them breaking with a single hit?.</li></ul><ul><li>OK OK, they were weak in extremely high temperatures... then FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY DO YOU STAND NEXT TO THOSE WEIRD GUYS ALL THE TIME?. How many suits do you need to lose before you realize they are weak in short range against that guy?.</li></ul>Just keep flying around him, bang bang with your laser stuff, BOOM BOOM with more advanced tech stuff and keep doing that until the guy is so shattered that he can't regenerate anymore.That would save a lot of time and it would look smarter, I expected more from Tony...",3,0,1,28 February 2014
Terminator Salvation," Worst of the series
","Let's see:Terminator 1: Oldie but goodie, if you watch it now you think 'ewww crappy CGI'.Terminator 2: A classic, if you hear 'terminator' you'll think on Edward Furlong as John Connor and the T-1000.Terminator 3: Even if Furlong wasn't able to act here, they did an awesome job, we got a good 'twist' in the plot and it was shocking (at least for me) to see the final scene where all the nukes blow away the planet. They weren't able to change a thing, BRAVO.Terminator 4: What the hell did I just watch? I was hopping to see how the world was after the machines attacked but it lacked the 'feeling', it was pointless, useless, I didn't care about a single character in the entire movie.It was pretty boring indeed, it was no surprise that a T-800 would try to kill connor (since we heard that in Terminator 3), but still... it wasn't really a great moment in the movie when he finally appeared.I'll stay with Terminator 2-3 and just make like I never watched this movie.",4,1,3,25 March 2014
Being John Malkovich," Very good movie
","I just keep laughing at the ratings, either it's a 1 or it's a 10 I give it a 9/10 It's an original movie with good acting, a good script and good development At the beginning it starts slowly, it can make you think 'why am I watching this?' But it's truly worth it to keep watching it until the end. This one became one of my favorite movies ;)One of the things I like best is that it's ending it's not predictable, you won't know what's going on until the endThe soundtrack it's awesome too, if you like instrumental music pay special attention to it",9,1,2,7 February 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Tired of IMF hunting Ethan
","I'm a fan of the series, I loved the 1st one, 2nd one (with awesome soundtrack by the way) and third oneHowever I'd love to see IMF working as a super team as it is supposed to be and not hunting Ethan Hunt (again)Movie 1.- He's hunted because someone set him up Movie 2.- this one is OK Movie 3.- He's set up again and hunted by other guys from IMF Movie 4.- Someone sets up the entire IMF (agaaaaain)Can't we just have a movie where we have this big bad and powerful guy that is impossible to take down instead of thinking on new ways to set up the same poor guy again?Also, the gadgets failing the entire movie was just too much, I got tired of them failing over and over Seriously guys, where do IMF buy their stuff? from ACME just as the coyote did?",4,3,6,8 October 2013
The Wolverine," Wors't X-men movie I've seen so far
","I just finished seeing it and the first thing I did was coming here to see how many guys share my disaponting on this movie, I can see there's quite a lot of people who thinks like I did.The wolverine transforms from a 'I don't care the world, I wanna die' to a 'I'll risk my life for some Japanese I just met'.I couldn't understand why they would CGI the old man, it was pretty obvious from the fist scene and I couldn't stop wondering 'Why the hell did they used CGI for that? he must change into something different later', they should have just used another old Japanese guy for that, who would notice anywya? I wouldn't... in fact I didn't know he was the same guy but they tried to make it look older...OK my review: Awful, it missed an important thing: A REASON for wolverine to risk his life, I mean... he keeps dreaming and he looks so attached to Jean, but he falls inlove too quickly... don't you think?.The only good part is they brought back Magneto and Charles, this means they came back to the original line they traced with X-Men 1-2-3, good move!.Just don't screw the next movie like this one please... PLEASE!",1,1,2,22 February 2014
