Skyfall," A traditional folktale for the ages ...and for all ages
","The Bond movies transcend the Bond books, in the same way 'Casablanca' transcended a so-so play that never made it to Broadway: 'They All Came to Rick's.' Where Ian Fleming ground out snobbish and often silly stories in imitation of a rather nasty and racist writer, 'Sapper' McNeile, the Bond films have created their own magic. Not all the movies have been great, of course. But in a half- century, a surprisingly number of them have achieved greatness. One of them is 'Skyfall.' It takes the by-now familiar ideas and themes ('tropes' in critic- talk) of beyond-the-pale arch-villain, technology bent to evil purposes, scenic tours of the world's most photogenic spots, scenic tours of the world's most photogenic women, noise and gadgetry, a preposterous plot/scheme/conspiracy, and a secret agent with the skill sets of Hercules, Horatio Hornblower, Sir Galahad, Michael Strogoff, Courier of the Czar (check him out) and Mr. Spock ... and conjures up a breathtaking world of action and entertainment -- a circus with a theme, or trope, if you will. But best of all, it uses an extremely able cast to tell an adult story. Yes, adult! By now the whole world knows that Judi Dench is one of the greatest actors living today. Here, she shows us why. This is not the 'M' of 10-second tirades, or an exasperated school- marm. In 'Skyfall,' 'M' is a three-dimensional person. Dench's scenes will probably be studied in acting classes for some time to come. Daniel Craig finally comes to grips with the Bond character, and, in so doing, creates a believable James Bond who is really capable of the derring-do that's part of his job description, yet maintains a very touching humanity. He harks back to the proletarian roughneck of Sean Connery, a type today's British Intelligence and SAS are more likely to employ than aristocratic dilettantes (although the latter did prove their worth in leading charges against machine guns in World War I, armed with nothing but a swagger stick and a Webley Mk VI revolver.) All this could not have been made possible without cinematographer Roger Deakins and director Sam Mendes. They've made a Bond film that's watchable. That you must watch.",9,2,6,13 June 2016
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," As always, should you or any of your viewing accomplices be bored or use the movie as a sleeping pill, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
","'Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol' is an example of what might be called latter-day 'wowpunk,' recent movies that make absolutely no sense but are fun to watch, because of their gadgetry, whiz-bang effects and non-stop action. You will need a large screen though to enjoy the circus. There is an actor named Tom Cruise who gets star billing, but he is probably a cartoon, as are all the other 'humans' to be seen. His part was not written but apparently sketched in. There is absolutely no reason for what his character does or goes through. Other characters talk to him. Sometimes he answers them. More often he hits them or shoots them, or gets hit or shot himself. When he runs, the camera action is speeded up so that he apparently outruns cars, boats, and, of course, helicopters.. You just know that justice will triumph in the end, and that all concerned will go on to another romp based on the ancient 'Mission Impossible' TV series, where some inventive sci-fi gadgetry papered over bad acting and moronic scripts. The director, Brad Bird, who up to now has been known for directing cartoons, brings his animation world-view to the job and creates a universe peopled by cartoons composed of flesh – they walk and talk like humans, but their actions, motivations and expectations are strictly those of Road Runner and Elmer Fudd. Things happen to them, bad things similar to those good old Walter Lantz tropes of grand pianos and bank vaults falling from the sky and driving characters into the ground. All of this makes for an adolescent's idea of heaven, with weaponry – automatic guns that are never aimed but just pointed in the general direction of a victim usually find their target as though by magic and rarely run out of ammo; computers – laptops and smart phones, slightly dated in their design, but with great apps for taking over the world; and a backpack of gadgets that Batman would have given his Bat-teeth for, all of which make the job of the good guys simple as pie. The scenery is eye-filling and expensive but slightly seedy, like the world itself today. Characters whip around the world, apparently on magic carpets, to exotic venues to do nasty things to each other. We visit the Kremlin, which seems to have the grandeur of your old high school, a Russian prison populated by easily excitable gentlemen; Dubai, where some great, great effects manage to make this film more than just color and noise (here's where a super-sized screen would be nice to own); and Mumbai, where a grand reception apparently catered by a demented wedding planner (look for a hilariously ill rehearsed though enthusiastic troupe of dancers) provides a background of intrigue, danger and the requisite seduction/assault. This picture commits many sins, including excessive product placement (for long stretches you may think you're in some Best Buy outlet, where they dump their outmoded, unsold electronics ) and an inability or refusal to use the talents of some interesting actors. For instance, Tom Cruise, whose production company gets credit for this movie -- which was a box office smash, the most profitable of the MI series-- is a caricature of himself, and at times is hardly recognizable, even when not wearing the intricate disguises that Mission Impossible dotes on. (Look for an absurd though funny scene where Cruise plays the youngest and most American general in the Russian army ) If not exactly showcases of acting and writing, The Mission Impossible movies can be improbably enjoyable. And should you decide to accept the trouble of watching them, they're also fun to pick apart.",6,5,10,19 February 2013
