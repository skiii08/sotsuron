Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best. Movie. Ever.
","Since their inception movies have come a long way, and in many ways they still have a way to go. However...the action movie reached it's pinnacle in 1981 with Raiders of the Lost Ark. It has never been beaten and for good reason. Oh how I wish I could be one of those who have yet to see this movie, I would give a lot to be able to watch it again for the first time.I have never met a single person who didn't like this movie. They may not have loved it, but I've never heard anyone who said they wished they'd spent their time doing something else. Personally, I think that's just about the highest compliment you can pay a film. This movie is a timeless classic. Don't miss it.",10,2,4,27 January 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Indiana Jones on the water!
","Campy dialoge, great action sequences, and fantastic characters make this THE movie of summer 2003.  Given it's origins it's TONS more fun than it deserves to be and is fun to watch the whole way through.  When its not action packed it's funny, when its not funny or action packed it's tense. When I left the theater I couldn't think of one thing I didn't like about it. 10 out of 10",10,0,1,10 July 2003
Identity," Sleight of hand mastery.
","I went into this film knowing that there would be twists, so I paid special attention to even the littlest detail.  That said the only way to describe this film is to liken it to a magician.  The magician knows your watching his every move,  so even though you think that you are watching the hand that is going to pull the fast one, in the end it turns out that you were eating out of both hands all along.  I really liked this one, a must see. 9 of 10",10,1,1,25 April 2003
