The Ring," Pretty much inferior to the original (may contain small spoilers)
","Many people like this movie better than the original, or hate it and still think it's made better. I'll give it the same those people gave it- they prefer it because: 1) The story line is more thought out.2) The effects are better in consequence to it being thought out more. For example, the victims rot as if being in the well. 3) After the deaths the movie cuts as if it was the end of the video, whereas the original had photograph negatives which many people found to be corny. I on the other hand, though I liked the remake's touch better, didn't find anything wrong with using the negative's effect. It rather suited the original.         If it weren't for such strange mutations of the storyline, I might agree this was the rare case in which the Hollywood remake was better than it's original. But the deal with the horses (especially the one jumping off the boat) didn't live up to it's original. There's no sign of a supernatural superstitious force, which makes the original much creepier. You don't know anything of the girl's father, and the mother was now talking english to her horse instead of another language to the girl's real father (from what I understood of it). So Samara just comes out as a normal angst ridden pre-adolescent who causes trouble. You don't see the hidden connection to the supernatural power which made her able to attack her victems through a video and make them suffer as she did.         And apart from that, the acting wasn't all that well either. The people were rude and unbearable (I'm certain not everyone acts this way in America). Part of the problem has to do with the dialogue. I'm sure Rachel wasn't meant to sound so rude when she said 'Excuse me, but what the hell are you talking about?'. She seems to catch on easily to the other clues in her way, surely she would be smart enough to catch on to what that woman was saying. In the original, her ex-husband gave her the clues. In this one he is just there and does very little.  You can't feel; the tension between him and his son either. Instead they talk about it- one of the faults of American acting. You should know what's going on by watching, not hearing.           But the worse thing is the failing attempts at comic release which certainly had no place in the film. Running with the hose and falling is one example. It just made the whole thing seem stupid.",6,0,1,2 June 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Lame and Overrated
","I tried to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark when i was young, but I was so bored within the first fifteen minutes I shut off the TV and did something worth while. I watched it again now to see what I missed. I didn't miss much.    The acting is bad- horrendously bad. The actors annoyed the hell out of me. That and the action was so ludicrous I had to wonder if all the fanatics of the series ever watched an adventure movie in their lives. Other scenes were badly played out, such as when the professors were discussion the ark, and the really lame bid with the student who had I love you written on her eye lids.     I kind of respect the series for combining an influencial hero and an adventerous plotline. You can see the influence in many more movies, stories, games, etc. But besides that, it's not really very entertaining. I just don't see what all the fans see.",5,7,21,20 August 2003
L.A. Confidential," It's hip, It's cool... it's also totally boring
","LA Confidential is a good satire on the Glamorous Hollywood/California image, if that's what it's meant to be. But although I liked some old film noir, nothing in this movie appealed to me except making fun of what is seemed so 'glamorous' about these places in California. Especially at the end, it goes from bearable to horrible. It turns into one of those movies where everyone dies instantly from one gunshot except the main characters who get shot multiple times and take forever to die, if they do at all. Suddenly someone has to satirize the satire.",7,2,5,2 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Most people who read the book may be disappointed
","I found the hype surrounding the movie overwhelming and exhausting. People who didn't even read the book and don't even understand it got wound up to go see it. Naturally I was turned off when I went to see it, so I saved my response until my bias cleared.      John Rhyse Davies said they created a masterpiece. But I question his highly outspoken pride and his sanity. Yes this is a good film, but hardly a masterpiece. The music plays all the way through and ruins the few good moments of good acting, and the dialogue is shrunken from it's original point and becomes a bit corny. ('Wow, your Aragorn!' 'Yes, I'm Aragorn' or something to that effect). Frodo, once a good hobbit battling his way instinctfully in order to do his duty in the book is on film running from everything and staring blue and teary-eyed into the camera.  Apart from that, the movie missed out on the humour of the novel (the only part of Lord of the Rings with anything merry or funny in it at all). All the British humour is missing, which is a huge disappointment as it was the best part of the book. The few laughs have been Americanized (into the Hollywood way of making a laugh by playing down instead of being a littled absurd).     In conclusion, what I am suggesting is that those who have read the book and have enjoyed it a lot may not like this movie. Those who hat e the book will find it long and boring. Those who are deep fans of the Lord of the Rings and know the ins and outs of it will be very entertained, because this was made for them, by them.",7,0,0,2 June 2003
The Exorcist," The funniest movie of all time!
","I'll give this film that it's still pretty creepy. The new effects make it better. But some of the things that made it the 'scariest movie' back then look silly now. Linda Blair bouncing repetively on her bed- I still do that when I can't get to sleep.   It's a movie worth seeing, if not to be chilled out than to laugh at.",7,0,1,28 June 2003
The Usual Suspects," I dont see it as a classic at all
","Though I see some twists. I found some of it predictable. And anyone who isn't a complete moron diagnosed with ADD can figure out in the first five minutes of the movie who the person''s real identity is that they refer to throughout the entire movie. For twists and suspense, it isn't great, especially for someone who's seen a lot of twists and turns.But the casting I like. There's at least some good actors who can pull it off.",6,3,6,2 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Much different than the book I remember.
","When you see a film which is based on a novel, or anything else for that matter, you must understand what you are seeing is the Director's version of the book; they're image in which the book gave them. Therefore, this is Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, not Tolkiens. Whether or not Tolkien would have like this would be up for arguement.    But Jackson makes a lot of assumptions and conclusions on the history of Middle-earth and weaves his movie around that instead of drwaing what is told directly from the book. For example, Aragorn and Arwin, with one of them falling off the cliff. This is not mentioned in the book, but is an assumption which Jackson has made.     While this film does great to draw in action fans and war fans, and does well with great shakespearian style acting, (those are its high points), it fails at portraying the book from my point of view. Though he does well at portraying the competitive friendship of Gimli and Lagolas, he steals away from the portrayel of orcs as horrid and powerful beings. He does not do well at balancing the two.  He also misses out on a lot of the imagery the book conveys.       But if you haven't read the book, these things won't stop you from enjoying a pretty good movie. It's much better and much more entertaining than the first movie he did.",8,0,0,2 June 2003
The Red Violin," Brilliantly Done
","Many really great movies are really long and I usually can't sit through them all at one time, but this movie was different. While I was watching it I had the same feeling I did the first time I watched Citizen Kane or the Godfather, and this movie certainly belongs with them as true classics.  I was also surprised when I watched it because I didn't think watching a two hour story on a musical instrument would really catch my interest, but the movie isn't about the violin itself but about the lives of those who held it. The value of an item is increased in the events it endures, and the 'piece of history' the violin is had been through a lot. I loved the way the story traced the violin's ancestors to the present, and the way the two 'buyers' at the end aren't of descent of any of the previous owners.",10,1,1,8 May 2002
Cube," Intense
","At first it took me a minute to get into it, but I was satisfied by the end. It was weird how it started out right in the beginning of the action and not the beginning of the story (how they got in their, the making of the cube) but it made sense because it would totally ruin the film if it did. It's better when it appears that there is no life outside of it.   Even the behaviour of the characters, although annoying at some times, are correct. They couldn't totally co-operate except for playing doing what they thought would benefit the group and kept bickering instead of working out the ideals. That's one of the main themes, stated when Rennes (who Wayne Robson portrayed perfectly) said 'you must save yourselves from yourselves.' It was also surprising to see Wayne Robson as such a good actor, only seeing him in The Red Green Show.",9,0,1,22 April 2002
