The King's Speech," Speechless!
",Totally relatable film. Emotions were very true while watching it. Not only was able to understand the different kind of hardships that royal people face. But this was really about someone whose greatest weakness seems so 'easy ' to the rest.,10,0,1,22 March 2019
The Equalizer," Nice first half, Flat second half
",The first half has a convincing story line but the second half looked very flat. It felt like I am seeing similar action storyline for the thousandth time. Initial killings and tension was really awesome. The character who will do bad things to people and give them a chance to be changed. But at some point of time it felt like he can kill everybody. The fight scene between nicola and robert was way too small which was disappointing.The best scene i liked was the monologue between nicolas and robert.,7,1,1,8 February 2020
As Good as It Gets," It was the best!
",Such a lightheated rom com with wonderful acting from both the actors. I just loved the melvin character. The transformation in that man was really soothing to watch. How a man changed from cocky to cool lovable guy. It really makes you feel good. Just watch it.,10,1,1,6 February 2019
Million Dollar Baby," Tough isn't enough!
",You ought to be more than tougher to watch this movie. Storytelling and acting is so touching that this is the first movie I wept for after watching it. The character of maggie and frankie will stay for long even after you are done watching it. When I started watching it I thought this is going to be about success and lime light a boxer star will get and movie will somewhat end on a happier note. But the main focus turned out to be very different. Maggie and frankie went so much through their life that I cann't even imagine. Hands off to the team 'MDB'. This is really a masterpiece showing an important issue of euthanasia.,10,0,1,1 February 2019
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Uri - An Okay film.
","I know my opinion will not please many people but still I will write this. If you disagree on any point then I would be more than happy.I do think that this film was created to please the masses. There was a lot of action, emotions and drama but it lacked the powerful enemy, thought provoking script. No doubt actors played their roles very well but the film lacked on the story line. The enemy country pakistan was shown in the 'dumber', stupidiest light. Even in the main fight scene there was not any struggle from their side which made it very monotonous. There were many scenes in which politicians and security personals from opposite were ridiculed and it was shown that our politicians are very serious and working hard for the country. Our victory was very flat.Since, this film is based on the true events, My expectation was that they will show in more detail what happened behind the scene but on this ground also I was disappointed. There were no deep discussion between in the meeting of security personal. Everyone was so clear in their plan that they just have to fix time and place to defeat the enemy. What were there plans if the mission would have failed? What would they have done?",5,5,40,12 January 2019
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Felt like I was there in the movie!
","Just seeing those depressing moments is so hard, going through them is literally a tough job. Acting of John nickloson just moved me down.",10,0,0,19 February 2019
Arrival," Linguistic Fiction!
","Instead of calling it sci fiction, I would better be call it as linguistic one. It lead you to ask some of the question of language like what are the limits of it? What can the limits do? Is there any universal language. Apart from the linguistic theme in it, the emotions and soundtrack was so awesome that it really made me cry. Watch it till the end, don't leave it in between otherwise you will regret it.",10,1,2,17 April 2019
Gladiator," 10+ Stars!
","I feel so connected with the hero of the story that I myself has started to love him. A man of total courage, empathy and honesty. Situations threw so much hardships to him but he stand to the fullest. It really pierced through your heart. For me the concept of gladiator was very new and this also fascinated me to watch the film. The story has been so beautifully potrayed that not for a single moment you realise that it is about 3 hr long movie. I must say hats off to the team gladiator for making this wonderful movie.",10,1,2,19 January 2019
