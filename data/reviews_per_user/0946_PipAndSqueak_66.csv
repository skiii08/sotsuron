The Lobster," There's none so blind that will not see
","Movie synopsis suggests this could be an interesting take on an ancient story. In reality, this turns out to be a cringing, hide behind the sofa self-justifying load of tripe. That is, the supposed 'transformed' animals have already been eviscerated. The only reasonable explanation you might find for the storyline is that all the characters are on the asperger-autistic spectrum, except as it turns out, two of the characters 'match-up' by creating the same artificial medical complaint. Our male protagonist witnesses both of these characters performing the necessary 'accidents' but still falls in with the malevolent Hotel's processes. Eh? (The 'couple' are truly matched, so what's the issue?)The second incomprehensible issue with this film is the narration by the main female protagonist whose journal is found after she is blinded, yet she still narrates the story leading up to the male protagonists attempt to join her in her blindness. So, whose, journey have we be on? Don't expect anything to make sense. I guess 'courtship' and 'relationship' building don't make sense to some.",4,6,14,15 November 2015
Changeling," More casual misogyny
","Is Clint Eastwood on a mission to right wrongs? A number of his directional efforts deal with the casual and unthinking misogyny of men. This is no exception. As an actress, Angelina Jolie is also no stranger to portraying the institutional 'inmate'. In this picture however, she changes sides and portrays, very well I might add, a woman made wrong by the hazing and self interested concerns of a corrupt legal and police system. The film put me in mind of the poor modern day victim of British misogyny Sally Clark who was accused of and imprisoned for killing two of her babies when real medical evidence suggested they likely died of infections. In neither this case nor the Collins case as in the film was the outcome good. Congratulations to Eastwood for producing a period piece with modern day parallels. The story is not over yet.",9,8,13,30 November 2008
Frost_Nixon," Effective PR
","Both characters in real life (Frost and Nixon) might be described as slime-balls. You'd therefore think a film with them both as lead characters would be a real no-no. Actually, this is a very well constructed depiction of a real life set of events. It doesn't matter whether there are non-factual links, it all makes perfect sense. Frank Langella is absolutely perfect in his role as Nixon. I was almost convinced into liking the old rogue - you see, perfect tricky Dickie for you! I've never liked Frost the person and knew that Sheen would be able to pull off this character just as he has tackled other real life characters that are equally shifty. Brilliant. I do recall in fact seeing some of the real life television coverage of Nixon and was reminded of this during the screening. It fitted perfectly. A must go and see, it's a cracking story.",8,4,8,25 January 2009
Deepwater Horizon," Believable recreation of true event
","Wow, this is a truly gripping and frightening representation of the catastrophic blowout on the Deepwater Horizon in 2010 that killed 11 workers but created absolute environmental havoc in the Mexican Gulf. The script, though slightly wordy for real real life goes a long way in helping you understand who the characters on the rig were and what their roles were in the event. The film is absolutely gripping and you'll be on the edge of your seat before you know it. Fire and exploding metal almost comes out of the screen towards you....without having to go to an Imax. No doubt, screened at an Imax this effect will be even more pronounced. Frightening and heart stopping in turns, this is a definite must see.",9,0,1,8 October 2016
Wind River," Flawed yet chilling tale
","There is an important message in this film...made explicit at the end for those of us who don't reside in that 'supposed' land of the free, the USA. To get to this message we first have to wade through yet more unpleasant realities of the USA. Nevertheless, suddenly, we find ourselves on a murder mystery detection trail. Trouble is, this is in the middle of nowhere-land. There is no close FBI agent so a diminutive, fresh faced city type from Las Vegas is sent....the authorities clearly have no intention of 'solving' anything. Step in local wildlife ranger, Renner, and the hard bitten local sheriff ...now the story really gets going and it turns out to be a rocky ride. The story and Renner are compelling which is fortunate as this film has some major failings. Cinematography is particularly badly directed with some hand held shakiness introduced at the wrong moments. Dialogue and diction is often incoherent or muffled. Script is not matched by actor action...or is not adequately captured in filming. Knocks the shine off what should have been a top class production. Instead it is so so.",7,2,6,9 September 2017
The Death of Stalin," Gallows humour with hollow laughs
","There's no avoiding truths rapidly passed over in this depiction of chaos following the death of an evil dictator. Stalin had charm...to those who were not his subjects and were never a threat to his authority. He fooled many so-called intellectuals in the West but everyone around him knew the truth, and, most managed to tip-toe over eggshells in order to stay alive. To thrive in such an environment requires a certain kind of callous ruthlessness...perfectly depicted with suitable crass humour here. The cast is perfectly chosen...each very accomplished actor adding their particular star dust. There's more than a single sittings' content in this film which deserves another viewing. Impressive and engaging story-telling based on real life events. Bravo all.",8,167,229,21 October 2017
Coraline," Stitched together comfort break
","There's some nice animation, even some occasional decent 3D visuals but nothing is sustained for long. It's a shame, because the lasting effect is one of disappointment not enchantment. The story is flawed which makes the denouement tame and limp. As a modern day 'fairy tale' it is anodyne and overly domestic in scope. The parent characters are recognisable modern harassed 'knowledge' workers - freelancers chancing their arm in a sea of competition, looking for a utopia that doesn't exist. As their daughter, Coraline inevitably shares their idealism and is set on a journey to re-conceive her life experience. Oh it's so droll and ultimately boring. Who ever animated the facial expressions got it spot on - perhaps they spent a lot of time looking in the mirror? A lot of navel gazing, methinks by all involved. A decent film for a young person. Nah, not really. Pretend you're back in the fifties and wear the goggles for the 3D - it's sideshow at the funfair experience. It'll remind you most of Comfort adverts.",6,3,7,13 May 2009
Knives Out," Takes the biscuit
","The most unfortunate thing about this film is that it is not so much of a turkey that you don't flounce out of the cinema half way through like you ought to. Daniel Craig is seriously miscast as the all-knowing and complicit detective. How, ffs, are we to take this piece that mixes outright ridiculous scenarios - e.g. a privately employed PI telling the real law what to do, when etc. We have caricature cardboard cutouts of murder-mystery stereotypes, dreadful script and extremely poor plotting. We are left looking at all the gewgaws and other props that don't seem to have any significance or interest value to the characters. Two giant eyeballs on sticks, for example? We have the servant good, employer bad shtick given the modern racist wash but we've had enough of that laundry. Frankly, the whole enterprise is a bore-a-thon. If it was supposed to be funny, that went right over my head. Jokes normally make me laugh. This joke of a film left me dozing.",3,45,92,4 December 2019
The Secret in Their Eyes," Strangely moving
","On the face of it, the underlying narrative for this film does not suggest much. It's a foreign language film that's made it to the mainstream. This is to do it a great disservice. Wonderfully shot so that you know precisely when the action is 'fictional' and when 'real' it is a tour de force in film technique. But technique never detracts from the action. We know precisely why our main man can't get over his infatuation; we empathise with the drunk - knowing all the while that he is a feeling man - peculiarly aware of the truth behind the crime stories that pass over his desk and through his office. He drinks in a realistic, not a stereotypical way. There are twists and turns aplenty and plenty to make you think. Ah, lovely. Real entertainment.",8,1,2,4 September 2010
Brokeback Mountain," Yawn
","Couldn't give a damn about any of the characters...yes film makers, one has to get audience engagement.... Panoramic pictures of countryside....yep got plenty of those I've made myself, so? Crap mumbling dialogue ...real cowboys might mumble and find it hard to speak...I don't care...John Wayne spoke (in a fashion) I don't care, there's no reason why you should care.... Don't care, don't care (What? It's been given awards...what for? What for.....?) It's as forgettable as the short story it's based on. Thin material spread molecule thin over two long long long long long long long, oh did I tell you, lonnnnng hours.",1,11,72,9 March 2006
Spotlight," Story avoids the spike by a gnats whisker
","Similar in story arc to Philomena, this presentation, though dealing with an equally huge impact story, manages to keep characterisatons Izal thin. Mark Ruffalo is the most compelling in his role adding urgency and doggedness to what might otherwise come across as a flat, even tempered tale. Some mumbling dialogue doesn't help either but these are nit-picking criticisms for a brave effort to progress the exposure of historic and ongoing child abuse originating within the Catholic priesthood. There's enough to keep your attention throughout and you won't regret see this film but you might just still have some questions. Good as far as it goes....I'm sure there could be a sequel.",7,0,1,13 February 2016
Yes Man," Delightfully spontaneous
","This is a very well scripted film with some great lines, amusing situations and appealing characters. Even Australian Norm, played by Darby is beautifully crafted. It's not to be taken seriously of course. This film is a fine antidote to all the bad news that is swelling the news media at present. There are moments when you don't even recognise Carrey, he has matured very well and suits the role given him in this piece. He has good support from the other actors with only one weak point - Stamp is not convincing in his role. He is too much of an ageing and wobbly old man...maybe it is a realistic portrayal of a couple of the 'motiviator' types that are still promoting their +ve thinking messages long after they should have retired. Worthy amusement.",8,3,4,10 January 2009
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Who do you turn to when no one tells the truth?
","Ah Smiley - who is not at all 'smiley' and beautifully portrayed by Gary Oldman. Casting is amongst the best features of this adaptation of Le Carre's book. Other things e.g. lighting and music don't quite work. Continuity isn't quite up to scratch either - you don't have to look too hard to spot a traffic calming hump on the road (something that did not get adopted in England until significantly after when this film is set.) Nevertheless, the film is absorbing - if a bit overlong. Somehow the 'tension' doesn't quite build to the strength it ought to and this may be because we see the tale in only one dimension. Smiley's actorly coolness - whilst necessary for the plot is antithetical to the creation of audience excitement. Firth fans will feel the pain when others don't but that has nothing to do with this film/story and more with Firth's previous roles.",7,3,6,17 September 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," Colourless
","Herge-Tintin-Snowy-Captain Haddock-The Thompson Twins - these are all much loved icons from the French films I was introduced to in my youth. I then began consuming the comic book versions. Film first, comic book second. I really will be surprised if children that age now, being introduced to Tintin from this modern English speaking version, will quite get the romance and desire to read the comics. I hated this film for its 'flatness'. The John Williams music is particularly dull and rubs the shine off a number of the action scenes. The animation too is not convincing enough - I found the characters' eye direction is quite often wrong giving well drawn figures a wooden feel. It felt like all the speech was in a monotone - the impression maybe got through that appalling music. I really don't want to waste any more time seeing this again to confirm or deny my assertion. I was bored. I expect children will be bored too.",3,19,37,6 November 2011
The Way Back," Escape tale by a man who never did it
","There are lots of nice ideas - more in suggestion than in the realisation by this film. Committed to a Gulag in deepest Siberia - apparently Nature will take its toll upon the prisoners rather than the conditions in the camp. This early statement strikes a wrong note right at the beginning and, unfortunately, this error is replicated for other overblown assertions in setting up the tale. The uneasy relationship between the escapees throughout their 4,000 mile journey also strikes a false note. Visually, there are some nice scenes but it doesn't make up for the thinness of the characterisations, the brevity of the detail in the survival skills necessary for this trek and the inevitable bonding that occurs - if only for the duration of the enforced comradeship. A tolerable film experience but not a classic.",7,8,18,29 December 2010
Capote," Malice aforethought
","Prior to seeing this film I had high regard for Capote's 'In Cold Blood', a slightly flawed yet impressive read. I knew just a little of the man himself but it wasn't until this film that I realised there might have been a second (intentional) reason for his use of the title 'In Cold Blood'. If this is an accurate portrayal of the man then I am convinced of his mendacity in tinkering in the fate of the two murderers. In this respect this is a fabulous feat of cinematography, story telling, documentary making and acting. Is it ground breaking? No, it is of its time, subtly tying up the loose ends we may have been unaware of....a great tribute to Capote's own effort. An evergreen film for all time.",8,0,0,19 March 2006
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Trio of red hoardings with effing
","You are warned at the beginning about the bad language and violence in this film. The language makes for a very realistic portrayal of small town life in the back of beyond. The violence will take you by surprise, even when you correctly predict what is about to happen. This is quite a feat and worthy of credit for the achievement. McDormand provides a thoughtfully expressed depiction of the kind of disenchanted, sad, mad and determined woman the murder victim's mother could likely be in such a real life situation like her character's. She nails it throughout, never missing a beat. There are amusing interludes sprinkled throughout...and completely necessary to keep us believing the story. It is indeed an interesting story but it does terminate a couple of scenes too early. Mildred does not realise she is going to confront the man who threatened her in her shop, her ex police dept buddy doesn't know she's met the man he suspects is involved in murdering Mildred's daughter. We don't get to see either. I expect a sequel at the very least!",9,2,5,20 January 2018
Gone Baby Gone," Gone B side
","This seems to be a Clint Eastwood wannabe movie. The Affleck's don't cut it though. OK, the principal character is supposed to be a young looking 31 but for x's sake he's incredibly dim for someone that age. Unfortunately, the story is revealed from his point of view so the viewer is left in the dark and can only pick holes in the story as told until it is eventually revealed that, no, they are not mistaken, the story teller is the dim one. This makes for very unsatisfactory viewing. The dialogue is often incoherent. Affleck's inability to move his lips when speaking doesn't exactly help. Freeman does the best with the material he is given but the film is already a dummy. He can't save it (or the baby). A shame really as potentially there is a lot to work with. Give this one a miss and wait for something better.",4,9,16,8 June 2008
Léon: The Professional," Nothing to lose
","Casting for this film is spot on, starting with Jean Reno as the ruthless contract killer, through incredibly young Portman as the orphaned girl, to Oldman as the psychopathic and evil cop. The hitman cares only for his killing skill, a potted plant (a prayer plant, I think) and the dreamy and imaginative routines in film musicals. The girl is lost, or a lost cause, both in her own eyes and those of her abusive family. Only her little brother 'loves her' and he is taken from her in the most brutal of fashions. The hitman can't help observing the whole nasty episode but is too knowing to involve himself, except, the girl has already tugged his heart-strings.
Script and performances help to create a truly chilling tale perfectly (well nearly!) captured by Besson's direction. In the end it is a real tear jerker though we doubt anyone has the least redeeming quality as all seem hell-bent.",9,1,2,5 April 2018
Burn After Reading," Spoof on spoof, spoof spoof.
","Owing to a problem with the cinema's ticket machine I didn't see the first few minutes of the film, but that doesn't matter so much. The best thing about this movie is that you cannot predict what will happen next. There are twists and turns aplenty, and many comic moments. It's not a comedy, but rather like The Color Purple, some dark issues that when acted out strike one as extremely funny. Gallows humour, as we otherwise know it, challenging the best from post room jokes and the like. The actors...all without exception... perform beautifully in their respective roles. How could any other actor replace them. The Coens are masters of their trade and this is another superb example from this virtuoso trio (yes I said trio).",9,2,5,19 October 2008
Bridge of Spies," Would it help?
","This is a very creditable attempt at telling the real story of 'Rudolf Abel' and the Cold War shenanigans that happened after the Second World War. Rylance manages to give a slight Scot's accent to Abel who was in fact born near Newcastle Upon Tyne (i.e. he would have spoken with a Geordie dialect). Never mind, Rylance conveys with perfect restraint the imperturbable front any spy worth his salt ought to aspire. This compares starkly with the slightly inept attempt at 'keeping secrets' shown by his American swappee, Powers, when subjected to interrogation. Spielberg manages to apply rose tinted spectacles at strategic points but thankfully, not too detrimentally. Compelling to watch for both Hanks' and Rylance's performances, you may be tempted to find out more about the characters they portray. Nice intro to the history!",8,1,3,5 December 2015
Hugo," Mechanical and formulaic trash
","Don't be fooled by the star names and big budget expenditure, this film is a dud. It lazily follows a checklist from successful 'one-off' films that deserved the acclaim they generated. The formula used here - just in case you want to know what icons have been ripped off: Lead role played by bright blue-eyed boy like in Lord of the Rings. Check. Semi-illustrated city landscape like in The Illusionist. Check. Kooky young female character with bad haircut like in Amelie. Check. Lots of bumping into things and lost bits and pieces like a junk yard - you know as in MicMacs. Check. Disabled character in a leg brace like in Bellevue Rendezvous. Check. Uniformed officer like Officer Crabtree in 'Allo 'Allo. Check. Big name actors....you got it!Check. Unfortunately, none of this works because the screenplay is absolute pants; the direction is directionless; the acting wooden; the whole concept from beginning to end just plain fails. A waste of time and effort - in the making and the watching. It rates a 2* only for the occasional cinematic effects that are truly wasted on this non-event of a movie plus the use of mini clips of real archive film (marvellous).",2,4,12,16 December 2011
The White Ribbon," Subtle account of the nurturing of hate
","I've seen more than my fair share of hateful behaviour during my lifetime so there were points during this film that seemed to drag. I don't think this makes it a bad film or a poor edit however. It struck me that there was a great deal of honesty about the treatment of the subject of hate. All of the action appears to have occurred during the year 1913-14 before the Great War began in earnest. The attitudes are those promulgated by the particular Calvinist sects that operated in the German speaking world. That hardness was also prevalent elsewhere in the English speaking world so it is not fair to suggest that Nazi's were bred this way. The Germanic way of subsuming emotions, however, has a lot to answer for. This film is, in a way, showing what happens when so called 'spiritual' ideals are placed above emotional bonds. There are many heart rending moments but, the one that struck me most was the Doctor's young sensitive son giving his father the bird he'd rescued in order to make his father feel better about the loss of the caged bird. Not only is the son considerate and emotionally intelligent but he sets his father a challenge. It's a very intelligent challenge and one that needs to be seen in the doctor's relationship with his murdering daughter. An incredible film, produced with great mastery and perfectly shot in a period feeling black and white. A must see.",9,15,36,23 November 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," No smoke without fire
","Having waited before committing to try out this story - I've been burned before and really hated 'rated' oddball films/book adaptations/translations, I have to admit this flick really does pack a punch. A worthy effort that belies the author's knowledge and understanding of an underworld we hardly ever get to see properly. Casting was spot on - I really can't believe that George Clooney was even considered for a role - he's far too full of himself and that's what is telling about the acting in this film. Everything spoken is almost understated - there is a delicacy in the way people in the Nordic countries speak that contrasts with the weight of what they say. This was perfectly conveyed in the English version of the story. Full marks for that and for making us believe that these English speakers were not English/American. I am now convinced that I will gain more from the books and will likely revisit the film again afterwards. ps. Now got the book and on first impressions this film is faithful to the intent of the novel (some variations for obvious cinematic reasons with information derived from the 2nd book 'The Girl Who Played with Fire').",9,2,8,5 January 2012
The Intouchables," Pragmatic
","This a straight-forward and simply told tale of two men discovering a mutual co-dependence based on physical need. Not what you might suppose! This is a tale of a poor immigrant man trying to keep heart and soul together whilst suffering various forms of social exclusion and another man trying to experience life whilst trapped in a paraplegic's body. They are poles apart ethnically, socially, culturally and pretty much every other way too. Nevertheless, the pair bond together through their common pragmatism. The wealthy invalid wants no pity and gets none from his unlikely carer. The outcast finds he has a social as well as an economic value. A heart warming tale and beautifully performed by all the actors - striking a very authentic note, even though we can see some 'facts' have been changed in the telling of this tale.",7,1,3,23 September 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Self interest occasionally proves to be altruistic
","On the face of it, protagonist of the story Ron Woodroof (McConaughey), is not a likable person or someone you might anticipate empathising with. Even by the end, you will have mixed feelings about him. However, in between, you will positively will this character to win the fights he jettisons himself into. This guy lives hard and means to live hard despite the 'death sentence' of his AIDS diagnosis. Acting, script and cinematography combine in a truly absorbing roller coaster story that challenges, instructs and entertains all at the same time. McConaughey and Leto turn in exceptional performances - both seemingly going to extraordinary efforts to develop the 'look' dictated by their characters. Faultless film worthy of several viewings.",9,2,2,5 October 2014
Inside Out," Misery on a stick
","OK, playtime's over Pixar, now get over it. This film is so plainly a prequel – c.f. references to a 'puberty' button on the new 'emote' console in the character Rileys brain - you will fail to find anything of entertaining value for your 100 minute investment. You may harbour fond memories of Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and Ratatouille – all unique, funny, thrilling and entertaining. But, that is not what you will get with Inside Out. 'Joy', after all, is banished to long-term memory and can't get back in charge of the console. (Since when was a single emotion ever 'in charge' anyway?). Inside Out can be taken as a metaphor for the poor sops who work for the Disney Corporation. Yes, they started out with true optimism about the life journey they had chosen, (with Pixar). Then, all of a sudden they are 'taken over' by a less than friendly peer. To compound this, they are moved from their original 'playpen' to a new post industrial work lot. All is grim. Sadness takes hold and taints everything that is done. Even 'Joy' begins to sob with sadness and grief. Save us from this self-indulgent misery. Not only is it inappropriate as kiddie oriented movie fodder, those of us who are sentient, self-aware adults can do without this additional mock unhappiness. By the way, most human brains have a 'fat controller' who orchestrates proceedings keeping everything on an even keel – even if that is 'sadness' for a while. Riley's brain seems to be lobotomised – even before puberty has hit. Give this film a wide berth, in fact, it might be best if someone scuttles this ship before the pestilence it's carrying spreads.",1,287,622,27 July 2015
No Country for Old Men," Chilling
","I've held a light for the Coen brothers ever since I saw Blood Simple - a very intelligent movie that requires the viewer to participate - you really do need to think. Now I find that really engaging - whilst I do have my moments where I just want something to wash over me and entertain me without requiring any effort from me I also like a challenge. The Coen brothers are capable of producing both these kinds of movie. It's why I can be certain what ever they produce it will have merit. No Country for Old Men is a return to Blood Simple territory. You need to have at least a passing interest in the psychological make-up of life's misfits to make the most of it but it is jolly well worth the effort. It is chilling, engaging, moving all at once. The actors all produce exemplary performances of their craft. It's already on my forward list for DVD purchase despite it's less than uplifting storyline. Well done the Coen brothers, well done all the actors, photographers and crew. Brilliant.",10,2,8,6 February 2008
Mamma Mia!," Cringeworthy
","It's quite a feat for the scenery to steal the show but that's what happens in this dreadful transfer from the stage to film. I tend to avoid musicals apart from the Gilbert and Sullivan type - deliberately tongue in cheek. However, I have a feeling Mamma Mia is a fine stage musical - it just doesn't work when straight actors take the main roles. The piece requires singers primarily as there is very little acting...a bit of dancing is called for but that is typical for a stage musical and there are plenty of performers who specialise in this genre. Streep and Walters are just so wooden it is unbelievable. Brosnan can't sing and Firth, what was he doing there? The daughter character comes over as a 13year old but is supposed to be 20 or so. So silly. This film represents a missed opportunity. The costumes are so much better than the dreadful stuff ABBA really wore, and the Greek island looks really enticing. Other than that there is nothing of merit.",4,13,22,13 July 2008
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Gripping
","Colourful, shocking (in more ways than you would think but not gratuitously), amusing, entertaining, beautiful, thoughtful, inspiring - what more could you want from a movie? This film has all these features and more. It really is a tour de force of great story telling, incredible production values, superb acting and finely tuned directing. Tilda Swinton is absolutely fabulous as the grand Dame whose demise causes all the drama to unfold. Action packed, 'mythical' and grimly realistic in equal measure this sure is a 'fairy tale' for modern times. It's worth seeing once, twice and many more times there is so much to take in. A classic.",9,4,11,15 March 2014
The Favourite," Warning
","IMDB refused to allow my earlier review - all I did was refer to some information recorded in the IMDB listing information for this title. Go have a look. I warned against thinking this as an entertainment. I retain that view. Ms Coleman deserved her Oscar, but not because this is a good film. Do not waste your money or time going to see this. It will NEVER be screened on TV because of its content. Take that as a big hint.",1,2,10,4 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," The warping mirror that is Hollywood
","I deliberately didn't read, listen to, or watch any reviews of this film before watching it. Let Tarantino tell me himself, let the movie speak. And so it does. Superficially, there is a tale of thwarted acting ambition, precarious employment, precarious life, gallows humour, trouble and strife (beautiful wives often coming with some hard to live with personal habits/traits they can do nothing about), the contrast between the 'haves' and have not's', outward appearances and the very different internal dialogue of certain characters...much more in fact. This, as we all knew before we stepped into the movie theatre, is a film we will revisit many, many times. It has plenty to keep us entertained for decades. Tarantino manages to conflate fact and fiction in a very entertaining, if gruesome, tale. His story references the Californian Tate and LaBianca murders, the Manson Family cult, the film careers of Burt Reynolds (who had, ironically been cast by Tarantino as the blind recluse at the Manson Family ranch, George Spahn, in this film but died) and Hal Needham, Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood, a precocious child actor - possibly Jodie Foster etc, and all the while referencing his own (Tarantino's) filmography - e.g. the reading of pulp fiction, 'Dogs' , music references etc. I haven't awarded a 10 only because this film cannot convey it's full message in one sitting - this isn't necessarily a fault but, by the very fact that this film has to be seen more than once sets it apart. It's a grim tale with some horrid truths wrapped in it. This is not everyone's cup of tea. I enjoyed it though.",9,11,21,18 August 2019
Gone Girl," Flawed but engaging crime tale
","Early on in this film, especially if you are really paying attention, you get notice that the story has been augmented in order for it to 'work'. The story, in fact, is extremely flawed with some absolute howlers of action/incident that are just too far fetched to be given 'benefit of the doubt'. However, these flaws do allow you to pick through the story to your own conclusions. Yes, there is a shocking and perhaps surprising development in the middle. You don't spot this because the character involved is portrayed as a 'desirable' type with looks and money. This is another of the incoherent motes in this tale. My feeling is that the story would be more realistic if the genders of the two protagonists were reversed. As it stands, the hardest flaw to reconcile is why the Ben Affleck character doesn't just up sticks and leave? Why was he sticking around to reach an anniversary date to deliver the bad 'news'? Lots of hype around this movie, join the crowd of chatterers if you want because you'll need something to justify the two hours plus needed to watch it.",7,0,9,12 October 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Pantomime fail
","Oh dear oh dear oh dear. What should have been a truly enthralling, captivating and magical tale is here turned into product placement, CGI and reasons for the film crew to travel to odd and interesting places. Ben Stiller may have been the correct choice as Walter but for heavens sake, everything else is wrong. Simple things e.g. making the dream sequences black & white would have made the story more 'genuine' - instead we and he can't decide what is true and what is imagined...to the extent that when he does have his real life adventures we don't care. In any case, by then we're looking at the scenery - nice, been to some of those places, nice to see them on screen. Pity the focus is on some stupid goings on that are just beyond far fetched (you know, a moon distance far fetched.)As a UK TV interviewer noted, 'Ben, you have very long legs for the size of your body' well, what else could the poor guy talk about. This film is a dud.",3,18,37,26 December 2013
Gran Torino," Tear jerker
","This is not a perfectly executed film but it is not diminished by its many faults. There are so many continuity errors you'd think it would distract from the tale. They don't. The story is a powerful one. Acting is also uneven yet that too doesn't detract. Amazingly, this is a very compelling film. Even when you can guess the outcome you'll still shed a tear or two at the end. The real story is mostly in the silences - the lost wife, the watching by the shaman, the aborted telephone call....this is what you watch. You know perfectly well what they mean and you apply whatever your cultural expectations determine for you. And that is the ultimate message of this film.",9,0,3,28 February 2009
Hidden Figures," A quiet revolution in full colour
","We sometimes forget the life-limiting rules that have been accepted as 'normal' that we would definitely reject nowadays. This film, set in early 1960's American South, shows just how hateful some of those rules were and how discriminative attitudes are so hard to change. We are in the realm of living memory for a sizeable percentage of the current population yet, the black ladies this film focuses on never bear a grudge for the depredations they are shown to have suffered. Their contributions to science and technology are all the more remarkable for that. This is the most thoughtful, inspiring and moving film you'll see this year. Its a joy to see such well made, engaging and entertaining film making like this.",9,1,8,4 March 2017
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Yawn
","The animation for this film is really very well done. The characters have a certain amount of reality about them. The story is just plain ridiculous. Fine, and this should be the basis of a good kids film. This isn't, oddly enough. I was bored very quickly, and the young audience I was sharing the film with were equally unenthralled. Several kids continued to play up throughout the presentation - a rather telling symptom of disinterest. This contrasted very sharply with the audience for UP who were very attentive as soon as the action started. I suspect the problem with Cloudy is the adult, relationship based story. Ideal for girls and Guardian reading adults. I wouldn't recommend this film and don't want to see it again, unlike much superior animations like Shrek, Up etc .",5,8,21,17 October 2009
Lincoln," Unconvinced Brit
","Well, I really don't know. This film really didn't move me. Somehow, the impression I'd got of Lincoln the man was more than what Daniel Day Lewis could muster for him. Nice casting for the film but it still struck a wrong note with me. Lewis too often portrayed him as a diminutive hunched and tired of life man. This is a pity because it may be because he was trying to capture the essence of the 19th century president whilst being surrounded by healthy, equivalently tall peers. The voice too is forced and squeaky. This is not commanding and domineering. Lincoln, a giant, immovably straight thinking juggernaut isn't to be found here. Sad, so you'll just have to keep your eyes closed and listen to the dialogue. This is mostly fair enough with the occasional trip into the preposterous. You know the story and know how this ends so you can leave before the end and not miss anything. Shame really that something better couldn't have been made to celebrate the absolutely extraordinary achievements of this unique man.",7,0,3,26 January 2013
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Overrated
","George Clooney - well there's an actor taking himself too seriously, taking to directing fictional films about subjects that would really be better produced as documentaries. Why is it that he felt it necessary to use only real film footage of McCarthy and not of Murrow? The clips of McCarthy were very telling to me. However, I know the vast majority of people would need to have the message interpreted for them by character development (by an actor playing the part - what a strange concept is that eh?) The black and white format is a mistake - yes people would have seen Murrow on black and white sets but he, the CBS and McCarthy certainly were not black and white. Did music also play whilst they walked down the street? This film jerks from scene to scene - George Clooney's clunking 'creative' directions do, as other contributors have noted 'break the tension'. Films need tension for heaven's sake! Go and see this film just to say you've seen it. It has no other merit except that maybe you'd like to see the real Murrow in action - a documentary filmmaker has a ready made audience....soon please.",5,2,10,9 March 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Trite
",I'm not sure who this film is for. Young people watching it will get precisely the wrong idea. Adults watching it will see a very silly representation of what would have been an extremely harrowing story if it was true. This production is very poor. I'm inclined to think that the presentation had the same treatment window dressers would give to a winter festival themed department store's windows. There are numerous continuity errors - it's a bit like an edition of 'Crossroads' except the props are not cardboard. At least it's only 94 minutes long - it'll be over before you've realised and it won't stick in your mind for long.,6,10,48,13 September 2008
The Imitation Game," Illuminating overlay
","What an absolutely riveting watch this is! There is some superb acting in this imagined story giving an explanation of Turing's role in the code-breaking efforts at the secret Bletchley Park. Even Cumberbatch's bright blue eyes give us a story - pinched pupil's at the moment he 'separates' from Joan Clarke (Knightley), for example. Thankfully, Knightley gives us a better performance than she has done for some time, though, some dialogue could have been better formulated. I might also quibble with the less than believable hat-less and cap-less characters at times - Charles Dance's luminous white bonce should often have been under a hat and, there should have been more Brylcream in evidence. But, hey, this is a really engaging film. Motives, scenes and quotes quite likely filched from other stories are used to set the scene - and set the scene they really do. We don't necessarily have to believe them though. Turing is, in this presentation, given an Asperger-like tic - well, true or not, it helps this particular story along very well.",9,10,20,16 November 2014
Cold War," Inexplicable sexual hunger
","There is a lot to commend in this depiction of the post world war rebuilding of lives and traditions. Not least are the singing and dancing performances that form the backdrop to the fated romance between the pianist and his beau of do-we-believe-it dubious background. This is, perhaps, a symbol of general everyday misogyny -the woman's talent is minimized? Hard to tell because the story arc is not easy to follow with too-long-held black blank screen breaks performing that necessary trope of story-telling aka 'Meanwhile, back at the ranch'. We don't really get to see why the two lovers are so dedicated to each other, or why they have little or no compunction in having serious relationships with other people. A mystery the viewer has to fill with their own day-dreaming, as with adding colour. It is a shame that, throughout, we are restricted to black and white visuals. A fault that is repeated in the rather two dimensional story telling. Entertaining enough but far from perfect.",8,6,20,1 September 2018
The Dark Knight," Unpleasant without redemption
",If I'd been sitting at the end of a row in the cinema I would have left after 30 minutes. I've sat through enough hard hitting films to know the difference between meaningful grit and wanton hatefulness. The production values in this film are so high that the 'terror' that is deliberately laid down seems genuinely possible in its evilness. The killings and explosions however do not support the supposedly 'psychological' subtext. Two men sitting either side of the same coin...or as Gotham DA's coin shows....both the same side... is not adequately developed. The story's many conflagrations and large set piece explosions cannot possibly have been set up by one man (The Joker) in any reasonable timescale - and certainly not in the one suggested in the film. The whole thing is just preposterous - it is just an exercise in slash and burn without relief. I had one hell of a headache after seeing this film - I can't have been the only one. One other patron I heard afterwards was positively spitting with rage and contempt over being made to see a film about 'some psychopathic sociopath not Batman'. Heath Ledger evidently had to do himself in in order to kill off the blasted character seeing as Batman wasn't going to.,6,10,19,12 August 2008
Pride & Prejudice," Close - room for another version yet
","Oh, yes, you definitely get the impression that Lizzie and Darcy are 'thinkers' - the reason why they are so confounded my their emotional responses. (The pride and prejudice). This version very eloquently displays the different personalities of the Bennet sisters and the way they position themselves for mating purposes. Not sure Rosamund Pike was the right choice for Jane - was she really so beautiful that she could play 'ignorance' of her beauty? I don't think so here. Keira's performance is a bit mixed but there is no harm in that as, surely, this is what makes her most authentic in the role. Judi Dench is absolutely superb as Lady Catherine and conveys in very little time the difficulty the young Lizzie will have after she commits to Darcy. Fabulous. Brenda and Donald work a dream as the much tried parents. I laughed out loud several times - a fine story well told.",6,7,15,19 September 2005
Alice in Wonderland," Colourful dream promptly forgotten on waking
","Oh dear oh dear. Here is another film ruined through poor scriptwriting. Linda Woolverton has only ever written derivative works and her lack of imagination shows. The dialogue is truly mind numbing, the plot thinner than a wafer and the reward for watching completely lacking. This is a shame because the animation, choice of acting voices, costumes and settings are superb. I really didn't want to pan this film but I have no alternative. It is a travesty. A wasted opportunity. I really can't think what possessed Tim Burton in persisting with this limp piece of work. The 3D is often not very effective and looks as two dimensional as the script. See it if you must. It will not survive long and will doubtless be found in the bargain basket once available on DVD.",2,2,5,13 March 2010
Up," Sentimental fairy tale
","Technically this is a wondrously perfected piece of animation. Seen in 3D it is on occasion very close to real - the coat of one of the dogs was very lifelike for example. As an entertainment I don't think its intended audience is really children. It's for parents and other adults who are generally child friendly. The story effectively pokes and evokes emotional responses. I cried at one point and it was evident to me that the whole audience at the cinema I attended were also similarly affected. This is an incredible feat for animation - but not unknown. The heavy emphasis on sentimentality however, I found detracted from the Lost World Adventure story that it should really have been about. Admittedly, the Venezuelan scenes were beautifully done, the was even a rainbow on the waterfall - as occurs in life, the subdued mood created by the first segment of the film could not be erased. It's a lovely piece of work - but don't go with a child who has recently lost a grand parent.",8,0,0,11 October 2009
Woman in Gold," Gold plated
",This is an incredibly moving tale well told in 'real-time' like documentary style stitched together with vignettes of the past remembered in full German language (subtitled) Technicolour. Overall there is a genuine feel for the truth of this story - as it is a real story. Even though some of the processes gone through to reach the final conclusion are simplified for film they nevertheless convey the size of the difficulties faced by Mrs Altmann and the prejudice and contempt she faced up to. The film also manages to convey a true feeling of survivor remorse as Mrs Altmann revisits her memories of the past. Mirren excels at this character acting and succeeds in embodying Mrs Altmann even though at first we recall her as Queen Elizabeth II. Definitely recommend to anyone with a good sense of history.,8,4,6,11 April 2015
Sicario," Grim drugs bust drama
","There are aspects to this film that resonate not only with the South American drugs war but also the grim events playing out in the middle east. As such, the film sets a terrible scene through whose colouring we are to view the rather too idealistic 'law enforcement' intentions of the female FBI agent. It is this character, played admirably by Blunt, that is the weakest link. This character seems incapable of asking questions, of making intelligent assessments of what is going on around her and, at one point, is reliant on a much more junior operative to do what she should have done. We are then supposed to believe that this character knows no self-defence moves and nearly gets herself murdered. To cap it all, whilst refusing to 'sign' a false declaration on grounds of principle nearly does the most foul of deeds - shooting a man in the back. Ridiculous, and really takes the edge off what should have been a really hard hitting, realistic and thrilling drama. Benicio Del Toro pulls off the most impressive performance of all as Alejandro. Well done.",7,0,2,10 October 2015
Inside Man," Oh come off it!
","Two hours diversion...if you've got absolutely nothing else to do. Too many stereotypes and stupid setups to be at all convincing. Lee, an idealist, makes heavy weather of a poorly constructed script. More could have been made of this mishmash of 'isms'....without spending the huge amounts of money that must have been needed to produce this old boiler. I don't for one moment believe that the 'idealist'robbers would have been so insensitive to the Jewish woman's discomfort when commanding her to 'strip to her underwear' given that they were intending to expose the Bank's Nazi sympathising Chairman. Or maybe that's the point, it's a dog-eat-dog world after all and there's gain to be had from anything if you don't have any principles.",6,1,2,7 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," You've been had!
","What a load of tripe has been written about the book and now this film. Dan Brown has successfully pulled a fast one and he should be congratulated for that. Ha ha ha! OK, now what did I think of this movie? It was passable but deeply flawed. So, we're supposed to believe that the character Neveu is both 'in on the secret' but completely ignorant of it at the same time? Eh, what? Whose story is this? The code breaker (Langdon)ought to be the minor character but he is made the centre of this piece. As a code breaker he too is a mass of contradictions...he recognises the symbolic meanings of all kinds of things before he spots the significance of his own part in the unfolding story (duh, a bit slow there methinks). Clearly a number of the characters (Silas included) have a set of noxious beliefs that cause them to do dreadful things in the name of their 'duty' to them. Beliefs have to be expressed in words...and words can be manipulated...and facts can be manipulated...and coincidental facts can be conflated...and rhymes can be made...and stories are told...and did you know who Leonardo of Pisa was?",4,0,2,2 June 2006
Steve Jobs," Style over substance
","Despite the actor, writer and director big hitters, this presentation manages to lose audience interest just part way in. We all know of Jobs' difficult reputation but his portrayal here provides neither realistic nor believable story telling. Here we are presented a man who goes into a funk the moment someone acts, thinks, or speaks their own truth. Thus, we are led to believe Jobs thinks he is god and cannot be crossed. Instead of creating light he has it extinguished, makes computers look like sharks and refuses to acknowledge the numerous slights and hurts he unnecessarily causes to all around him...oh, apart from his big funders. Similarly, this film casts no light on the man and his motives, trashes the reputations of bystanders and leaves you gnashing your teeth for having wasted your time and money.",5,0,0,24 September 2018
There Will Be Blood," Realism with major flaws
","I'd read other stories about the hard lives and deceptions common to the early oilmen seeking their fortunes. It was thus with trepidation that I went to see this film. One definitely gets a flavour of the hard stoicism of the participants as the script and acting are superb. Nevertheless, I'd liked to have seen more of the slimy/silver tongued ruthlessness in the later dialogue with the corporate oilmen that is reputed to have persisted at the time. The film as a whole is a great testament to the many tales that no doubt can be told about this period in the US's history. However, I found great fault with the musical choices throughout - all overly intrusive, clanging and orchestral when something more basic and wild would have coloured the scenes much more effectively. Daniel Day Lewis was fabulous as usual but the Director should have insisted that he maintain the 'limp' more consistently - a major scene early on after his injury sees him running without impediment...such a shame as otherwise Daniel's performance was spot on. A hard film to watch.",6,9,18,10 February 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," Learn why stimulants are 'needed' to feed greed
","Whilst not a film for everyone, this production really does deliver a punch. DiCaprio is absolutely compellingly right for this role - really gives him opportunity to show his range and ability. Who knew that you could fall down a short flight of steps in so many ways! Full marks to the screenplay/writing. Everything has a natural flow and feels right for the period. Supporting actors are well chosen and are worth following throughout....hidden 'back stories can be detected' via these characters - quite a feat given how 'busy' the main story is. Saying that, however, you will occasionally check your watch....how much more of this do we have to watch.....well, that gives the other side of the Wall Street/Investments story. To con their marks the whole lot of these people resort to stimulants, uppers, downers, anaesthetisers and all manner of other anti-social kicks. Reality seems a long way from where these people go. And so it was.",7,1,4,22 January 2014
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Too much ham
","If you are determined to find silly films romantic and engaging nothing I am about to tell you will matter. If, however, you need your entertainment to convince and engage you this half-baked presentation will cause you nothing but irritation and exasperation. Lilly James as Juliet manages to pout and flounce like a four-year old dress-up princess. Her skills in acting are in repeating learned lines and nothing else. Other, better actors, in this presentation also put in poor performances. This perhaps suggests the actors' disengagement with the script and direction. They would certainly be aware of the glaring mistakes being made in depicting war-time occupied Guernsey. Not surprising when female authored work is converted into a vapid and stupid screenplay by ignorant men. This ignorance extends to some gross visual mistakes. Have you ever seen a rack of pork? No, you haven't and, more to the point, no farm boy or country bumpkin would make the mistake of cooking the whole part of a pig carcass that is usually made into bacon as a joint of meat. This is what we are presented with here though! There were other, in fact a whole host of stupid mistakes caused by those involved not seeking accurate historical references or seeking the honest guidance of those who know. Give this dire rubbish a miss.",4,14,35,12 May 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," Muddled mish mash
","Well, if you want and go to see a film where George Clooney gets a slap or two on the face, this is it. I'd slap the Clooney any day but multiple slaps still make this an unsatisfactory film. I laughed a couple of times, out of frustration, I think because I couldn't make much else of this hodge-podge of insider references and pseudonymous clap trap. Yah, Frances McDormand makes the best mini-appearance performing a slapstick trick in the editing room. Other clowning is seen but is less memorable. Rope tricks might have your attention for a little while and a bit of table top tap dancing might have you wondering about health and safety. Did they really dance on top of the table cloths over shiny melamine tables? Tilda Swinton does double duty as twins Thora and Thessaly Thacker... or thwacker? Nice. Nothing else is.

Murder on the Orient Express," A no tension crime snoozer
","Branagh has re-imagined our favourite five foot four dark haired dandy detective as a faults finding Teutonic styled giant. We therefore set off on the wrong foot. Poirot's mental tussling with the truth of the story, as it is later explained in full, is therefore lost. Poirot is wedded to the truth, wedded to the expression of himself in his punctilious attention to his personal appearance...up turned moustache and dark hair and all. He must tell a lie or have himself done in if someone in the murdering cabal of train travellers is to see justice done. It's nice to see a full set of famous actors in all the character roles....it gives just a hint that we should take them seriously...as might the operators of the Orient Express and their wealthiest patrons. However, this is not enough to compensate for the already compromised story which thus has to limp on ....and on...and on..through a weather induced derailment and the exposure of the murdering mastermind. It's too easy to fall asleep because there is no tension to keep your interest. I was thankful when this came to an abrupt and unsatisfactory end as I really had better things to do elsewhere.",4,10,26,4 November 2017

","Yes it looks good ....or rather, that it ought to be good, but, it isn't. The acting is superb, the settings are superb, the props are superb, the script is fine, but the whole is very much less than the whole. It falls apart on so many levels one wonders what sort of skill it takes to ruin such a promising venture. Make no mistake this is one big failure of a film. The action fails to engage, the tension fails to appear, the love interest is flatter than a week old pancake, and Holmes's sleuthing is about as believable as the man in the moon. There's some pugilism that might interest boxers but that's about all. Two hours of mild diversion. I yawned several times. You will too.",3,19,37,31 December 2009

","I'm sorry to say that this beautifully executed Pixar film is just not quite as good as it could have been. It is a shame that dialogue could not have been introduced properly between all the main characters. There is too much dependence on visual effects, insider jokes and references to fulfil the needs of multi-aged entertainment audience. A bit like going to the ballet - if only there was a little bit of drama and speech... This is not to say the film is without merit - it deserves awards for the animation and ideas alone. Unfortunately, that's all it deserves. A shame because I really wanted to say I loved this film - I didn't. It's OK....oh dear.",8,3,6,19 July 2008
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Right up there where the sun don't shine
","For ordinary mortals looking for a bit of entertainment, this won't provide anything of interest. This production is so clearly an 'in-joke' by those whose business is theatre/drama/blockbuster cinema, you'll immediately feel marginalised. Ha ha... see what they did? There you are, already sympathising with our 'hero' as played by aging Michael Keating. This is quite a neat conceit and works really well. This is so much removed from the pap that often derives from US movie houses that your surprise at its 'intelligence' might catch you off guard. Keaton and Norton put in superb performances and cinematography captures the behind the scenes 'disorder' that accompanies any polished public performance in theatre-land. That said, it took me quite a while to work out when it was 'Birdman's alto ego talking (in voice over) as opposed to something actually mumbled by Keaton. 'Birdman' refers to himself as Icarus several times and we know what happened to him. We only assume that Birdman eventually falls to earth though this films leaves him on a high.",5,4,15,11 January 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
","You may be attracted to this film by the two lead actors Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks and, your instincts would be right. These two pull off a wondrous piece of story telling that feels genuine and authentic. Thompson and Hanks have done their homework and manage to incorporate true to life characterisations. A shame Colin Farrell couldn't manage the same as his character stands alone as forced and contrived - maybe he was trying too hard to encapsulate PL Travers' 'idealisation' too much. However romantic her memory, there is still room to make the character grittier. I feel Jude Law might have made a better choice for this role. Paul Giamatti is the readily identifiable US actor you can never name - in this vehicle doing an impression of Eric Morecombe, or so it seemed to me. It is the Ralph (Giamatti)character that enables the pathos of the story to unfold. Funny, interesting, sad and entertaining all in one film. Lovely.",8,1,10,30 November 2013

","Gratuitous violence. Yawnfest mid way. Silly plot - actually, a plot that could have been interesting if people had spent more time developing it instead of rushing to film. Poor casting, or rather wrong casting....probably more to do with generating box office profits because of the appearance of the BIG NAME - who doesn't in fact make an appearance until well into the film. Admittedly, the whole enterprise seems to improve once the BIG NAME makes an appearance suggesting a lot of effort being made to keep BIG NAME on board. The plot is completely predictable and it is unnecessary to watch to the end. Any child can work it out. Grim to watch. No payoffs - what's the point???

This woman, who knows she has a fight on her hands the moment she decides she's going to bring a new innovation to market, says hardly a thing when the inevitable problems start surfacing? No No NO. There are some fab actors in good roles in this production but, they can't deliver superb performances if they have no material to work with.

These people neither inhabit the roles they have nor seem to appreciate what it is to be in a crisis scenario. Lots of hamming and flapping all to no good effect and productive of nothing more than pantomime on film. Script is partly at fault but Eastwood's direction must also be called into question.

","Well, I guess you have to be Catholic to get anything out of this complete pile of rubbish. The whole premise of the story and presumably the book is absolute cow dung. Child of 13 misreads what she sees, witnesses two couples having sex and rather than reveal the truth about her purportedly innocent under age friend, implicates her real 'love' interest (a.k.a.jealous obsession)in a 'crime' in which her aforementioned innocent friend is a willing player. Who are we supposed to be empathising with? The now old woman who tells us she is dying (oh yeah - she's a story teller)so she's written a 'novel' based on her real life experience - except that she's incorporated a little tidy up where the two victims in this story get something they never even got close to experiencing - i.e. a time of true intimacy. So, its a 'novel' not an autobiography on this basis is it? If you've read this far and think I'm being too harsh - well I haven't started on the stupid errors in the filming yet. If you want to waste some of your life watching this tripe watch out for the empty war time buses (unbelievable), the crepe bandage stuck straight onto the head wound of a soldier in the hospital and all the other over drawn out and idiotic cinematic 'effects'.
