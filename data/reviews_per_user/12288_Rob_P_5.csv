Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Utter rubbish.
","Without equal, this is the most puerile, utter rubbish even conceived. It's made Sacha Baron Cohen even richer because people have flocked to see it and part with their hard earned cash.I reckon only die hard fans will pick up the DVD...The funniest moments are the interactions near the beginning with those members of the public who threaten SBC with bodily harm if he gets close to them.As for the rest... instantly forgettable...Just remember, you'll never get these 84 minutes back...And think of the hit on your download allowance if you want to see it that way...Avoid it at all costs.",1,4,9,12 September 2007
Disturbia," A cracking watch!
","Quite well-paced and if you'll forgive the obvious teen flick nods - teen hero goes it alone, cops don't believe him, etc. - you'll enjoy it.To be fair, it's not as bad as I've made it sound. The characters are likable, even David Morse as Mr Turner - always a crowd pleaser! Nice to see Carrie-Ann Moss do something different too.The opening scenes with his dad and the drive home were brutal...But the star has to be Shia LaBeouf as Kale Brecht. If he continues to give performances like this, he's onto a winner.Well worth the watch.",7,1,2,13 September 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," I'm NOT a comic book fan... oh no... but this was a great film.
","I'm not a comic book fan so I cannot comment on the purist's view of The Fantastic Four.Okay, the first film was 'okay' as they learned to deal with their new powers but this was so much better. This movie was like the third season of a popular show. You know, the first season sucks, then the second season starts to get on its feet and the third season rocks! As long as they keep their heads, FF:/// should be as good as Spiderman 3.There's an easy friendship and banter among the Four although Susan Storm getting naked isn't that cool any more. Okay, we've seen her, let's move on. Tip to scriptwriters of 'FF:3', why not keep her clothes on...The weddings were a bit pitiful... why did they bother? All in all, a decent sequel (they are few and far between folks!) and worth watching.",7,2,4,13 September 2007
The Happening," Be aware of what is Happening...
","Apparently, according to sources here on IMDb and on some other motion picture review sites, I am in a minority.I liked The Happening and for the life of me I cannot explain why.The cinematography was superb, the pace just right and the acting sublime.Yes, it is a very good film but it is not a truly great film so I gave it 7/10 stars.Mark Wahlberg does not fail to impress once again. I'm just a little concerned that he may become typecast in this type of role, yet he is totally believable.Zooey Deschanel emanates emotion as her life appears to fall apart around her. There are times when I genuinely feel for her character Alma. She is being overwhelmed by what is happening in the world she inhabits and she is already tied up in guilty little secrets she has kept from her husband.As for the other characters... well, it's not really about them, is it? It's about Elliott and Alma.And as for the plot? When the cause was first put forward, I felt a shiver down my back.As much as many people are writing off this storyline as too far fetched, even for Sci-Fi, I find it totally plausible and therefore very, disturbing.There is a lot of screaming in places, but there is a lot of calm as well. Just try not to read the calm as 'nothing happening'. It's a mass calm that could only really come about as the people realise the enormity of the situation and how impotent they are to stop it.",7,0,1,2 July 2010
Back to the Future," Still ticking the boxes after 26 years
","I have lost count of the number of times I have watched Back To The Future - I even bought the trilogy box set! For me this first in the series will always remain head and shoulders above the other two.Time travel movies tend to be complicated and often dull. You need to keep up with the plot and when things go awry, you can find yourself lost or just bored.Not so with BTTF. Even now, 26 years on, I was still sitting on the edge of my seat as Marty and the Doc attempted to get the lightning strike just right - and I KNOW that it all works out in the end.But that's the draw of this fantastic movie - it continues to thrill after 26 years! Even TV editing for content and character comments does not detract from the spirit of the movie.Highly recommended.",10,1,1,2 April 2011
