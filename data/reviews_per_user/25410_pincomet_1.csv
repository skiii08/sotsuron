Come and See," A Great War Film
","Elem Klimov's 'Come and See' is a very moving film about the Nazi German's trying to take over Belarussia in 1943. it impacts the viewer with shocking images of a burning image that makes you wonder if it's actually happening for real. The protagonist Floyra is a young boy, who joins the Partisans army. he desires to fight because he wants to do what everybody else is doing. But what he sees during his time in the army is enough to scar him forever. Even though Florya doesn't say much throughout the movie, his expression says everything. By the end of the movie Floyra ages like 30 years. It shows how he has lost his innocence, but has not yet lost his humanity. In the last scene when Floyra shoots Hitler's picture it seems like he finally gets his revenge for what Hitler and all the German's have done. When he shoots the picture and he gets to the part with the baby, it really makes you think. It made me think about how you never know what a baby might grow up to do and if you had a chance to stop it from when he was a baby, would you do it?",10,2,2,30 July 2010
