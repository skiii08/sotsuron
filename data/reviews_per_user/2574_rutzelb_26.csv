War Dogs," Better Than Expected
","This is based upon true eventsTwo friends David Packouz (Miles Teller) and Efraim Diverolia (Jonah Hill) venture into the International Arms race and deliver on a contract to provide guns to Baghdad, Iraq. Later, they search Pentagon Offers and - with some creative accounting - win a $300- million Arms Contract to supply the Afghanistan Army with AK-47 ammunition. I didn't think I would like this because I was afraid Jonah Hill would try to be a comedian again and he's never close to that consideration. This is considered a Comedy/Drama (Whaaaa?) However, I saw this as light drama only and found that Jonah Hill does a very good job. If there were funny lines in here I missed all of them. His partner, David, has his troubles with his wife. Bradley Cooper is Henry Girard, who is able to get the logistics part of the Afghanistan contract for the boys.Sound like a slam-dunk, right? Things do go wrong and not in areas you would think. A problem arises when the boys find out the ammo is Chinese, not Russian as they were told, and the US won't accept that. The solution is the beginning of their downfall. (Whaaaa?) Then later David gets a call from a New York Times reporter regarding the contract in Afghanistan. Oh, oh. Here we go The beginning of this had way too many F-bombs all over the place. Everyone spouted them with every utterance. Then, for some unknown reason, the F-bombs went away and slowed down a lot. Still there but not like In the beginning. Why all the F-bombs? Realism? Give me a break. (Me too)Notable: a very pretty Ana de Armas as Iz, David's wife.All in all, not bad, and better than expected. Yes, they get caught, but the reason they get caught is something you will not believe, but..believe it. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

Wind River," Very Good Thillelr
","This is based on true events On an Indian Reservation in Wyoming, Hunter/Tracker Cory (Jeremy Renner) helps a new FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) to discover who killed Natalie (Kelsey Asbille).This moves along very nicely and the music is loud at times and that's okay as it signals impending doom. Cory finds Natalie dead in the snow as she appeared to have been running from something. The Coroner won't list her as a homicide because the cause of death was lungs bursting in the very cold although he believes it is a homicide. Jane needs it to be a homicide in order to bring in other FBI agents, but now she has to work things out herself and enlists Cory's help.The photography is simply outstanding as is the cinematography. The acting all around is very good, but sometimes the sound is a little muddled and it is difficult to hear character dialogues and one must listen carefully. You would think that Cory and FBI Jane would gather clues to determine who killed Natalie, but this is not the case in its entirety. You'll see. Well, they do so up to a point but the resolution will kind of shock you, maybe. Even though Cory is a Hunter as he calls himself, we wondered who he worked for and on the side of his pick-up we see the words: Wild Life Officer. So he works for the State of Wyoming. Mystery solved. Hey, we had to know. Notables: Graham Greene as Ben, the Tribal Chief of Police; Gil Birmingham as Martin, Natalie's father. We see a lot of snow and snow mobiles racing here and there. Very cool. Would like to get one.All in all a very good thriller and again, the resolution may surprise you. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, Natalie is raped. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some at times.",9,1,4,15 November 2017
Darkest Hour," Great Movie
","In 1940, King George VI (Ben Mendlesohn) picks Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) to be England's new Prime Minister. All fear the war with Germany is being lost and many want Churchill to agree to have Italy start negotiations with Germany. Churchill is against that. Many in Parliament want Churchill out. Churchill orders all civilian boats to go to Dunkirk to help evacuate about 300,000 troops stranded on the beach there. 
 
Since there are 2-Churchill movies out at the same time it is hard not to make some comparisons. First of all in Darkest Hour there is no mention of Operation Overlord, a plan by the Allies to invade France to push the Germans back and this is being discussed at the same time 300,000 troops are stuck in Dunkirk when Churchill orders civilian boat to help evacuate the troops in Dunkirk. The movie Churchill talks about both.The name of Churchill's secretary, who types all his speeches , in the movie Churchill is Miss Garrett. In Darkest Hour her name is Miss Layton (Lily James) Why this apparent difference? There are some other discrepancies, but they are minor compared to the ones just mentioned. I did notice that in both movies Churchill never seemed to have a Security Detail with him. We saw Churchill talk with U.S. President Roosevelt asking for destroyers and Roosevelt says cannot do because of some new U.S. Laws. Then Churchill asks for planes that England has already paid for. Roosevelt says cannot do again because of new U.S. laws. However, Roosevelt does say England can pull the planes into Canada and that would be acceptable. Now here's the thing: The planes issues was never addressed again in Darkest Hour.Nobables: Ronald Pickup as Neville Chamberlain, the outgoing Prime Minister; Kristin Scott Thomas as Clemmie, Churchill's wife.When Churchill was agonizing over what to do: fight or negotiate, he finds support from 'friends' in a car in the Underground (subway system) and now knows what to do. To sum it up one rider says that if the Germans ever invaded: ' They'll never take Picadilly.' And the rest is history. Acting by all was excellent. In Darkest Hour we see Winston Churchill and not once did I see Gary Oldman. What a performance. The Oscar is a lock for sure. (10/10)Violence: No.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Very Good
","The Empire takes scientist Galen (Mads Mikkelesn) back to work on the Death Star, a weapon that will destroy planets. Jyn (Felicity Jones) is raised by Saw Gemera (Forest Whitaker) and when she comes of age she knows how to defeat the Death Star as she sees her father, Galen, in a hologram and he tells her he put a loophole in the Death Star Plans that will destroy the deadly weapon so others will know how to defeat it. Jyn joins the Rebel Forces now known as Rogue One to find her father, Galen, and to get the plans and transmit them to the rebel forces. This is a prequel and we know this because we see Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), C3PO, R2D2 and at the very end: Princess Leia (Ingvild Deila, but the voice of Carrie Fisher) The CGI cinematography is simply incredible and just to watch these scenes is worth the viewing with the sound off. Kudos. The music plays all throughout the movie and is very good.Captain Andor (Diego Luna) is the supposed love-interest for Jyn, but nothing happens between them until the very end when they embrace. Felicity Jones as Jyn does an incredible job and she is very pretty too. HA!Comic relief was very good with the robot K-2S0 (voice of Alan Tudyk) and he was given some spot-on lines. For example: when Jyn shoots a similar looking robot, the real K-2SO tells her, 'You knew that wasn't me, right?' HA!Most of the movie, of course, is all about CGI battles and it could put one into La La land, but they are exceptional and there is no denying that. Kudos. Notables: Jimmy Smits in a very small role as Bail Organa, a Senator with the Rebellion; Forest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera and we see him again during the last big battle; and Ben Mendelsohn as Director Krennic, the Empire's chief engineer. What I didn't understand was this: why didn't the rebels go after the Death Star Weapon, but only went after the Plans for it. I would have thought they would have gone after both.

Passengers," A Love Story, sort of
","Over 5000 people in hibernation pods on the starship Avalon are heading to the planet Homestead II, which is 120 years away. Something happens and Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up 90-years before the ship is to land. After a year alone, he wakes up a very pretty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) from her pod. He admits to the Android bartender, Arthur (Michael Sheen), that he feels guilty about waking her up. Later when the very pretty Aurora finds out what Jim did there is hell to pay and the relationship is now on shaky ground. I saw this as a love story, sort of, and although this is a slow- going I am held by the banter between Jim and the very pretty Aurora and the set design of the ship and these scenes are fantastic. The stunts and computer special effects are exceptional. Kudos.We see Gus (Laurence Fishburne) - a deck crew chief – appear as his pod also malfunctions. His appearance is crucial to the story because he knows something is wrong with the ship and he tells the pretty Aurora and Jim to find the main cause of the ship malfunctioning. Then a hole appears in the ship and the very pretty Aurora and Jim must find a way to work together to save the ship and themselves. Can a very pretty Aurora find a way to use Gus's wristband to override medical commands in the infirmary to save a life? Inquiring Minds are watching closely. Later Jim finds a way to allow a very pretty Aurora to go back into a hibernation pod to continue her journey to Homestead II.All in all this is quite enjoyable and we stay engaged because we are not sure what will happen next and will Jim and the pretty Aurora get back together? Inquiring minds are on the job. Then we see a note on the screen that says: 88 years later. (What? This is over already?)Then we see the formerly hibernated people open a door to the rest of the ship and we are allowed to see what they see. This is a really good ending. Sad, but good.

Thor: Ragnarok," Excellent, but too long
","After freeing himself from a prison on the other side of the Universe, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) learns that Odin (Anthony Hopkins) is not in Asgard. Thor and Loki (Tim Huddleston) go looking for Odin on Earth and are told by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) where Odin is on the condition that all Asgardians leave Earth. This is agreed to and they find Odin in Norway. Odin tells them that Ragnarok (the complete destruction of Asgard) is about to come about because his oldest child Hela (Cate Blanchett) the Goddess of Death has come back from her prison because he can no longer hold her there. This can't be good. Long story short: Thor is captured by Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) on the garbage planet controlled by Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), and he finds Loki there who seems to be friends with Grandmaster. In order to escape, Thor must defeat Grandmaster's champion The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) also known to Thor as Banner. (Remember: both Thor and the Hulk are part of the team The Avengers). The Hulk doesn't recognize Thor. Oh, oh! Continuing Long Story Short: Thor, The Hulk, Loki and Valkyrie finally escape Grandmaster's planet to fight Hela on Asgard. It is here we realize the time on Grandmaster's planet was way too long. Way too long. The title of this movie is somewhat confusing. We thought Ragnarok was a evil being that needed to be defeated. Not so. It is just a term for the destruction of Asgard. This movie is a good one with spectacular CGI, but it is too long and put me into La La Land several times. Many scenes could have been cut out or shortened, but I wasn't consulted. The acting all around is spot on and the music is also heart-stomping good. Yes, we do see Stan Lee as he is in every Marvel movie in some capacity. Here he cuts Thor's hair.Notables: Karl Urban as Skurge, and he becomes Hela's Executioner; Idris Elba as Heimdall who is the Sentry of the Bifrost Bridge; Ray Stevenson as Volstagg; Sam Neill as the actor Odin seen when Thor returns to Asgard and watches the play; and Luke Hemsworth as the actor Thor in the same play.Oh, remember Jane (Natalie Portman) Thor's love interest from previous movies? She is not in this movie. Bummer. All in all a good movie, but too long (We cannot say that enough times). Believe sequels will show Asgardians on Earth where Thor will have to deal with Doctor Strange again. Will we see Jane again? Hmmm........ Stay tuned. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Molly's Game," Excellent Movie, Oscar Worthy
","Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) was an Olympic class skier, who didn't finish an important run due to injury, then we see her 12-years later running high stakes poker games for Hollywood elites, sports stars, business captains and unknown to her: the Russian mob. Then the FBI arrests Molly and she needs a lawyer and gets Charley Jaffey (Idris Elba).This is some good true story and the real winners in here are the dialogues between Charley and Molly, who together form an unbeatable team with their quick dialogues and comebacks. It's like they made up the script as they went along. That's how good the dialogues and these two actors were. Kudos. Doesn't happen often. The scenes bounce back and forth between the present and earlier times in Molly's life and the way it was done was seemless when Molly thinks about an earlier time, we see what she sees. Kudos. Molly narrates and sets up many of the scenes we see and it's not important that we understand all the gambling lingo and it's just fun to go with it and most of all we see Molly is in complete control of the situations. Charley wants Molly to give up some hard drives to the FBI that give names of famous people whose lives will be destroyed if they became known. Molly won't do it and Charley says she will go to jail. Oh, oh. Notables: Kevin Costner as Larry Bloom, Molly's father; Michael Cera as Player X; Bill Camp as Harlan Eustice, a hard luck gambler; and Graham Greene as Judge Foxman.No Oscar nominations for Chastain or Elba, but they should have been nominated as they truly gave Oscar worthy performances. This movie could have been nominated for Best Picture too. Didn't happen. Normally, with true stories there are statements at the end of the movie telling what happened to the main character(s).

Spider-Man: Homecoming," Excellent
","Coming back from a mission with Tony Stark/Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr) Peter Parker (Tom Holland) waits for a call from Happy Hogan (Jon Faveau) Tony Stark's right hand man to go on another mission with the Avengers. We never do learn what that mission was but Peter Parker wants to become a member of the Avengers. In the meantime he must attend High School and as Spiderman he cruises his neighborhood to handle petty crimes or to help people. Spiderman breaks up an ATM theft, and discovers the weapons used are alien in function. He tries to warn Happy, but is not successful This must be some kind of reboot of Spiderman. Many things are different. Peter's Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) is a young hottie, without husband. Ned (Jacob Batalon) his HS chum discovers that Peter is Spiderman. Peter has a love interest in Liz (Laura Harrier) and we find out later that her father is bad guy Adrian/Vulture (Michael Keaton), who was a salvage contractor who is shut down by Local government official Ann Marie Hoag (Tyne Daly). The Avengers battled and beat aliens called the Chitauri and much of alien equipment is salvageable. Adrian decides to keep much of the alien equipment and makes weapons out of them and later turns himself into Vulture. We will see that Tony Stark doesn't have all the confidence in 15- year old Peter Parker and takes back the special suit he gave Peter. Peter feels he is nothing without the suit and this disappoints Tony Stark. Somewhat shaken Peter Parker goes it alone to take down Adrian and his organization and learns that it isn't the suit that helps him.Notables : Stan Lee as an apartment tenant who shout s out a window; Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts and we see her very briefly near the end of the movie; Chris Evan as Captain America, but we just see him in a TV motivational presentation for high school students. This is actually very good, a little too long, perhaps, but very good nevertheless. The CGI is fantastic and the music helps things along too. Stay after the credits run to heart stomping music to see an additional scene with Adrian in prison. Why they put it after the credits is beyond me. With this new reboot we should see more of a more mature (he did turn down Tony Stark's invitation to stay at Tony's new place with the Avengers) Spiderman and maybe with the Avengers too. Should be good too. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Brief soft stuff.",9,12,19,18 October 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Very Creative And A Masterpiece
","Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand) is upset that the police haven't solved the rape and murder of her child, Angela, (Kathryn Newton) and she erects Three Billboards to let police Chief Willoghby (Woody Harrlson) know how she feels. This also tells her that the whole town is against her and she could care less. She is extremely frustrated and feels this is the only way to get the police to do their job as it's been too long since Angela's death.As far as I am concerned this is simply a masterpiece. The writing, dialogues, the acting and the story itself can be nothing less. It is perfect. And when you have Woody Harrelson in the story, give him the Oscar because he is that good. Well, he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor but didn't get it. Bummer. Sam Rockwell as Deputy Sheriff Dixon did win the Best Supporting Actor Award. Frances McDormand did win Best Actress for her portrayal of Mildred and she was going to be very deserving and a lock. Kudos. This movie was also nominated for Best Picture and got caught in a buss-saw: The Shape of Water Otherwise...............who knows?The story does take a few twists and turns that did surprise me. There is no suspense or tension in here, just good acting with good actors in a very good creative story. We will see some very deep emotions from the townspeople, the police and from Mildred too, however it doesn't go off the rails. Notables: Abbie Cornish as Anne, Chief Willoghby's wife; Peter Dinklage as James, a friend to Mildred; John Hawkes as Charlie, Mildred's ex-husband; Lucas Hedges as Robbie, Mildred's son; Caleb Landry Jones as Red Welby, who sold Mildred space on the three billboards; Clark Peters as Sheriff Abercrombie; Zetjko Ivanek as the Desk Sergeant.Kudos must also be given to Martin McDonagh who wrote and directed this movie. And he should have been nominated for Best Director. The movie was nominated for Original Screenplay. That's something. Cast-wise, the real winner in here is McDormand's Mildred as she is a take no prisoners lady, and you will like and sympathize with her. You go, girl! (10/10)Violence: Yes.

The Lost City of Z," A Well Told Story
","This is based upon a True StoryBefore WWI, British Officer Major Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) is ordered to survey a border dispute between Brazil and Bolivia because rubber is the product both countries want. On his second trip to the Bolivia jungle he discovers pottery made by natives who he believes are a much older civilization than most Western countries. Of course, he is not believed and is somewhat ridiculed. After the War, he goes back to find what he has labeled as the City of Z (The British pronounce it ZED), but this time he goes back with his son Jack (Daniel Huttlestone).This is a well told story and considering the amount of material involved in here, this is some accomplishment. This is very well done. The acting all around is excellent. We see Fawcett's wife Nina (Sienna Miller) who is instrumental in discovering an article by a Conquistador who believed there was a civilization of Natives much older than believed by the West. And she wants to go on Fawcett's next trip and, of course, that can't happen (Shades of Womens' lib here). I have to tell you that Robert Pattinson is in this movie because no one will recognize him with his beard and he really isn't given many lines of dialogue: basically he is just there beard and all. He is Henry Costin, Fawcettl's right hand man and good friend. I have only 2-objections: We should have been privy to more landscape scenery of Bolivia and, perhaps, the more important one: lack of a good musical score. This movie made me recall the movie THE MISSION that had a wonderful and memorable musical score. Didn't happen in here and it should have. Bummer. The objections aside, this is a story told on a grand scale and we cannot wait to see how it all plays out. Kudos. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes.

Baby must use head-phones to drown out the noise from Tinnitus suffered in a car accident that killed his parents and when he drives the music is turned up really loud. You are in for some fantastic driving and a little bit of Demolition Derby near the end. Not sure if the driving was real or CGI, but it was sensational and everything was enjoyable.The acting, and driving stunts are very good all around. The music is also heart-stomping good.

Justice League," This is what I'm,talking about
","Since the passing of Superman Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) feels the world needs help to ward off the evil Steppenwolf who is in need of three boxes that contain ultimate power. He needs those boxes to destroy the world and start over: his way. The boxes were hidden so evil could not find them and destroy the world. Bruce Wayne needs to field a team of super-heroes to combat Steppenwolf and make sure he doesn't get the three boxes. He does this with Wonder Woman's help, but feels it is not enough and the team comes up with a plan to revive Superman/Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) with the help of one of the boxes they have in their possession. This is the movie we have been waiting for. We didn't know how Superman would come back and this plan using one of the most powerful boxes in the world seemed like it would work mostly because no one really knows the makeup of Superman from the planet Krypton. The Justice League: Batman, of course, Jason Momoa as Aquaman/Arthur Curry; Ezra Miller as the Flash/Barry Allen, Gal Gadot as Womer Woman/Diana Prince and Ray Fisher as Cyborg/Victor Stone.There are two winners in here: the CGI as it is some of the best I have ever seen and the story about the return of Superman. Steppenwolf is a CGI creation and Ciaran Hinds is the voice of Steppenwolf. (Could have fooled me. I thought he was a real guy)Notables: Jeremy Irons as Alfred, Batman's right hand man; Diane Lane as Martha Kent; Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Connie Nielsen as the Amazon Queen Hiippolyta, Wonder Woman's mother; J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon; Amber Heard as Mera an Amazon warrior; and Joe Morton as Silas Stone, Victor's father. The story is very good and we knew it would have to be epic. (Destruction of the world would seem to do it) The acting all around is spot on. We see many interactions among our superheroes and we wished there were more. This is for us: We Believers who grew up on Superman, Batman etc comics and wished it wasn't fiction and when we read the comic book we snuggled into our private reality and wished the comic book story never ended. Actually, it never ends for us as like I said: we are Believers. Stay until some of the credits run to see a race between Superman and the Flash.This is a great story of the return of Superman and some of us Believers did have that box of Kleenex handy just in case. Now we can wish for more Superman movies with or without Batman, but with is okay, too. Now we can add Superman to the complete Justice League. This is what I have been talking about. Been too long.

Hidden Figures," Wow! What a story. Who knew?
","This is based upon true events.Three black women made history without any of us knowing the contributions they made to successful NASA launches with men aboard. The women: Katherine G. Johnson (Taraji P. Henderson); Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spenser); and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae).Back in the day when we were kids, we saw news programs of NASA putting rockets with men in them into orbit. We saw that they did so seamlessly and after while it became like a piece of cake. Well, this movie shows us that a lot more went into that piece of cake then we were told or knew about. So much so that we had no idea what it was like for black women working at the Langley NASA compound with Colored sections for almost everything. Katherine is the known math genius who knew Analytical Geometry a very specialized math that Al Harrison (Kevin Costner) feels is most necessary to put a man into space. Dorothy knows computers and bones up on the Fortran language that the new IBM 7090 computer runs on. Mary also works in the Computer section, but wants to become an Engineer to work with the engineers there but because she doesn't have the required degree she cannot. She petitions the courts to allow her to take the required courses at a strictly White school and that was granted. Katherine works at the Flight Research Division and has absences to use the Colored Bathroom about ½ mile away. This takes a while before Harrison notices she is not at her desk and when she comes in the door soaking wet and tells where she was Harrison finally takes the imitative to terminate all Colored Bathrooms and they are to use restroom closest to their desks.We see that Katherine is instrumental in doing the math for John Glenn's (Glen Powell) launch and recovery. She is kind of acknowledged for superior work but it is all low key. We had no idea there were problems at Langley between white men and black women. Who knew? But these women fought thru all the obstacles to find their place in history . As far as America knew all went smoothly at Langley. It was very uncomfortable seeing these women treated that way. It's not that the United States had a Segregation problem, no, the US had an Integration problem. And probably still does in many instances. Notables: Kirsten Dunst as Vivian Mitchell a supervisor over Dorothy and her computing group; Jim Parsons as Paul Stafford, the Chief Engineer under Harrison's main research group and not very friendly to Katherine.Stay until the end of the movie to find out what happened to those 3-women and it's all good.I love movies where someone has special powers or a talent that everyone is in awe of.

La La Land," Very Good
","Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) a traditional Jazz piano player and Mia (Emma Watson) an aspiring actress meet and fall in love. Sebastian's dream is to have his own Jazz Club and Mia's dream is to be a successful actress. I told them I wanted Westerns to be brought back and what they did was to bring back a Musical. A Musical of all things! Well, it wasn't too bad and it got a lot better after the first 15-minutes when they showed a traffic jam on the freeway and everyone got out of their cars to sing and dance. Pretty lame and you could tell the voices were dubbed in. What was I in for when this movie was nominated for all kinds of Oscars? Someone should have seen those first 15-minutes didn't work. The music was not of the toe-tapping kind the dancing was okay, I guess, but way overdone. I was beginning to think this was going to try too hard. Woe is us. The story really starts when Sebastian and Mia meet and their chemistry was spot on. Kudos. We hear them singing and see them dancing. The choreography was excellent for two actors not known for singing and dancing. Hey, it worked and was enjoyable to watch all the rest of the way. Mia decides her auditions weren't working and starts to write a one-woman play. Sebastian is offered a job by Keith (John Legend). The music here is what I would call Jazz Rock and is meant to bring in the younger crowd because no one really likes traditional Jazz anymore. Or that is what is commonly known. Sebastian doesn't really like this kind of music but it's a job and he needs a job. Things work for a while until troubles come to paradise and we see dream conflicts. Oh, oh.The music and choreography - after the first 15-minutes - were very good and maybe those Oscar nominations were deserved after all. (Of course they were) The movie did get Oscars for: Best Actress: Emma Watson; Best Director: Damien Chazelle; Best Original Song: City of Stars; and Best Original Score.Notable: J.K. Simmons as Bill who fires Sebastian because he wouldn't play the traditional Christmas music and ended up playing some serious Jazz. This may be the start of Musical Revivals, but am still hoping someone will bring back the Westerns. (9/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity; No. Language: Only on F-bomb was heard.",9,4,6,27 April 2017

In the 1960s, a very lonely Elisa Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a janitor in a government top secret facility somewhere in Baltimore, MD. when an 'Asset' (Amphibian Creature from a river in South America) is brought in to the facility by Security Chief Strickland (Michael Shannon). She tries to communicate with it and they form a sort of friendship. Hey, I had my troubles with the Beauty and the Beast fad that went on and on and on and I said, 'Here we go again.' The movie is a good one, but I would not say it was the Best Picture as it did win the Oscar for it and also for the Director. This is a creative movie, but we seem to be going off the rails again as they did with Beauty and The Beast. See?Elisa is a mute, she can hear but cannot speak and she is cared for by Illustrator artist Giles (Richard Jenkins) and I am not sure what the relationship is as it was never addressed or I missed it.

So we will see a lot of war fighting with CGI, of course, and these scenes are absolutely brilliant. Yes, we must keep in mind that this is not just a movie, but what we see on the screen had actually happened, maybe not in the exact same way, but happened nevertheless. We are looking at true heroes as we would have seen in those other war movies I chose not to watch. Because of the success of Seal Team 6, we will be inundated with these war movies for some time. The area of contention in here, besides all the fighting is the small war between Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), the leader of the Green Berets and General Dostum (Navid Negahban), the leader of the Afghanistan Army (actually a tribal War Lord). They go at each other mostly because the General won't tell Captain Nelson all he needs to know. That spilling of info was a long time in coming, but it finally did. Then later they differed on strategy. Hey, can't have everything to run smoothly and this is a serious war, don't you know?The acting all around was excellent and very convincing . The cinematography and overall photography was stunning. Yes, they used horses to knock out the big missile battery and now there is statue of a Green Beret on a horse near the site where the Twin Towers used to be. Why? The 12 Green Berets that went on that mission were bound not to talk about it because it was a very classified mission. Also, this was the First foray into Afghanistan after the 911 attack. Now you know. Notables: William Fichtner as Col Mulholland who sent Captain Nelson on that mission even though Capt Nelson had never been in combat; Rob Riggle (Yes, that 'comedian' on NFL Today) as LTC Bowers, Capt Nelson's Commander; Michael Pena as Sam Diller a key member of the Team; and Michael Shannon as Warrant Officer Hal Spenser, 2nd in command to Capt Nelson.Even though you know most things that happened, this is still worthwhile movie to see. The conversations between Capt Nelson and General Dostum are worth hearing. This is history and we must never forget 911 and the reason we went to war. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Kong: Skull Island," Best King Kong Movie Ever
","In 1973, Bill Randa (John Goodman) convinces a US Senator to fund and supply military escorts to an Island recently discovered that may prove to be of geological significance and the United States should get there before Russia. This is, by far, the best King Kong movie ever. The Island is perpetually surrounded by very fierce storms and when you see the storms from the approaching ship that house the helicopters to ferry everyone to the Island, you won't believe people would actually decide to go thru this kind of vicious storm. Cringing from my couch I couldn't believe it either. (Hey, it's only a movie) It doesn't take long for Kong to make his presence known. And it doesn't take long to discover the real reason Bill Randa wanted to go back to this island. He knows what is there. We get to meet Lt Hank Marlowe (John C. Reilly) who was shot down during WWII. The movie opens with a Japanese and American parachuting from their shot-up planes confronting each other ready to kill but are interrupted by King Kong. We see that Marlowe has lived among the natives there who fear the giant lizards (among other things) who live beneath the Earth. King Kong protects the natives from the Lizards. The military led by Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson) wants to kill Kong for what he (Kong) unleased on Packard's men flying in with their helicopters. Those scenes are simply breathtaking and you will come to believe you are there. Scary? Yes. The CGI is so spectacular there are no words to do it justice. Kudos! Kudos! Kudos! The photography and cinematography are also spectacular. More Kudos. Acting all around is very good too. Brie Larson as Mason Weaver is an 'antiwar' photographer (her words) and she constantly takes pictures. I was amazed she never ran out of film using something like an Argus C3 or C4 but with an added viewer. (Hey, it's a movie and like a dream anything is possible so there is no running out of film or anything )The group encounters giant spiders, and lizards who look upon the group as food. Once the group knows the real reason Bill Randa wanted to go to this island, the focus now is on getting off the Island. The rest of the movie has the group facing other lizards and trying to get to the North part of the Island where helicopters will ferry them to the ship. The last big dramatic scene has King Kong fighting the very BIG Lizard. Again, these scenes are so good you believe they are truly real. More Kudos. Okay, okay we all remember Fay Wray with King Kong in another Kong movie. Do we think we will see this Kong protect our limitless film photographer Mason Weaver? Stay tuned.And stay tuned after the credits run as there is more movie to see. I couldn't believe all the people involved in making this movie and you won't either. But stay and see the last scenes to the movie and here you will come to believe there will be a Kong 2. Can't wait. (9/10)Violence: Yes, Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Brief soft stuff only.

Murder on the Orient Express," Good Production
","Famed Belgian Detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) has just finished a case in Israel and decides he just needs a rest, but a telegram tells him he is wanted in London and he agrees to go. From France he takes the Orient Express when a murder takes place on the train and he is put to the task once again. No rest for Poirot.Since this is a remake many of us know who did the murder either from the 1934 novel by Agatha Christie or the 1974 movie. For those who have not seen the previous movie or read the book, will they figure it out? Hmmm.............This is a very good production showing intricate scenes within the train, colorful period clothes, breathtaking mountain scenery, CGI showing an old-time locomotive racing thru the mountains, and dazzling sunsets with heaven-like pastel colors. The acting all around is very good although Poirot steals most of the scenes with that outlandish and quite unnecessary mustache. One cannot help but focus on that mustache when Poirot is in the scene. Pity. At times, he talks so fast some dialogue can be missed. Bummer. Okay, who was killed? An antique dealer Samuel Ratchatt (Johnny Depp) whose real name is Cassetti, who got away with a kidnaping and murder of a child Daisy, the daughter of the well known Armstrong family. He was stabbed 12-times, some strong blows some shallow.Notables: Josh Gad as McQueen, as a secretary to Ratchatt; Michelle Pfeiffer as American socialite, Mrs Hubbard and also Linda Arden; Daisy Ridley as Mary Debenham the Governess to Daisy Armstrong; Judy Dench as Princess Dragomiroff; Derek Jacobi as Edward Masterman, Ratchatt's valet; Penelope Cruz as Pilar Estravados, a former nanny; Lucy Boynton as Countess Elena; Willem Dafoe as Gerhard Hardman a Pinkerton agent; Dergei Polunin as a Count Rudolph; Daisy Ridley as Governess Mary Debenham; Leslie Odom Jr as Dr. Arbuthnot; and Tom Bateman as Bouc, the Director of the Orient Express.Josh Gad did a great job and he should stick to drama and not comedy where he is never funny.
 
The music during the movie is very good. When the credits run you will listen to Michelle Pfeiffer singing 'Never Again.' Good job. Well, there is one clue that comes quite easily and Poirot eventually figures out who the murderer is. Will you?Poirot still cannot rest as once again a telegram comes to help solve a case in Cairo.

Arrival," Very High Anticipation Factor
","12 elliptical spheres come to Earth and settle down in 12 geographical locations worldwide. All know they are UFOs and why are they here? What do they want? Are they friendly? What do they want? Why are they here? What do they want? Is there an echo in here? Linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and Theoretical Physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) are brought in to communicate with the aliens to find out if they are friendly and why they are here and what do they want?We can be somewhat thankful that the US Army doesn't bring all their tanks and fighter jets to confront the Alien ships as we have seen in many Sci-Fi stories of the past. No, we see a more civilized approach, but Louise and Ian are as confused as we are. This is slow-going, and we keep waiting for something to happen that will benefit mankind. Isn't that why movies are made? Ooops, my mistake. Okay, long story short the Aliens are here to give mankind a gift now because in the future - in 3000 years - they will need our help in return. When you find out what that gift, is email me so I will know. One could say the gift is for the nations of the world to find a way to work together to avoid destroying themselves. You buy that? Louise does ask them how do they know the future? How indeed?We see Louise struggle with trying to communicate with aliens who look like giant squids and we see-flashbacks with her daughter Hannah leaning about language and emotions. We also see that her daughter will die from cancer. Now here's the thing: those are not flashbacks, but flash-forwards. Did I lose you already? Hmmm.. Me too. Notables who really don't do much in here because this is all Amy Adams's story: Jeremy Renner the love interest to Louise; (Hey, could this be a love story?) Forest Whittaker the colonel in charge; and Michael Stuhlbarg as Agent Halpern as an antagonist to Louise.The Aliens seem to make a sound like whale sounds or was that the musical score? Hard to tell. You see I don't buy any of this. Why? Because aliens who are much more advanced than we are would surely know how to communicate with us 'in our language.' Hey, I have seen enough Star Trek stories to know this. How about you?What held me? Why the Anticipation Factor, of course. What will hold you? (7/10)Violence: Yes, there is an explosion.

Wonder Woman," Pure Entertainment. Kudos
","When WW 1 comes to The Amazon Island we see a plane crash in the ocean and Diana (Gal Gadot) who is in Amazon training, knows she must leave. Later she discovers her true powers and becomes Wonder Woman. Keep in mind she is a Goddess, but she is not aware of that yet. This is what we have been waiting for and it doesn't disappoint. This is terrific Entertainment at its best. Those of us who grew up reading comics of Superman, Batman and others are taken back into believing all this is possible and it is here that we want to believe once again. And so we do.We see a young Diana watching a plane crash in the ocean. She dives in and saves the Pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). With her Amazon sisters she helps defeat the Germans who were after Steve Trevor. Later he tells the community of the war and millions dying because of it. Diana feels she must go and help and defeat Ares (God of War) who she believes is causing all this misery in the world and once he is dead peace will come upon the world. Her mother Antiope (Robin Wright) reluctantly lets her go with Steve Trevor. It was fun seeing Diana experience some of society and learn about it. Steve had promised to take her to the war and eventually they both go. Once at the front all bets are off and Diana goes and does her thing and it is here we see her destroy the enemy. This goes on from time to time defeating the enemy, but the main goal is to find and destroy the building where Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya) also known as Dr poison is making poison gas that will kill millions more. The choreography and CGI is something to behold when Diana goes into action and we never tire of it. They are that good along with the heart rendering music. Kudos. Diana is surprised and disappointed when she kills General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) who she believed was Ares and the war didn't stop.Of course there is a twist in here and you may be surprised about it. We see the real Ares (David Thewlis) show up and he fights Diana to the death. Ares tells Diana that only a God can kill another God and does she have what it takes. These fighting scenes are like something we have rarely or never have seen in other movies. Kudos again.This was a solid production and deserving of all Awards it receives. The acting by all and cinematography were excellent.Kudos to Patty Jenkins who directed this movie. Fantastic job. All in all this was a special treat for we Believers in comic book heroes and we hope to see many sequels in time with the same Gal Gadot who we fell in love with.

Black Panther," Delivers as Promised
","T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) returns as King to his homeland Wakanda. Wakanda is considered a third world country isolated from the rest of the world, but due to a meteorite that landed in Wakanda that contained Vibranium, the hardest metal in the Universe, the people were able to advance in technology and do not want to share their technology with the rest of the world for fear the Vibranium would be weaponized and constant wars would result. When T'Challa drinks a special herb affected by the Vibranium he gains superhuman powers and is known as the Black Panther. Okay, that's only half of the story that you need. The next half is that M'Baku (Winston Duke) challenges King T'Challa and beats him in a King's Challenge and throws him over the waterfall and all believe T'Challa is dead; M'Baku wants to sell Vibranium to all countries to help the downtrodden peoples of the world have a chance at a better life and not caring about the consequences of wars among the countries.
 
So these are the 2-issues you need to focus on. There are some other issues, but you only need these two main ones. Oh, Nakia (Lupita Nyong'o) T'Challa's love interest wants Wakanda to share its technology with the rest of the world. T'Challa isn't too keen on this. The Hype this movie received is well worth all the publicity. The sets are outstanding, the fight scenes and plane battles are expertly choreographed as much CGI is incorporated. The acting all around is spot on. No doubt about it, this movie delivers. The only thing I had trouble with were the darkened scenes in the beginning. Then later at the end we see the fight between the NOW Two Kings and Black Panthers: T'Challa and M'Baku at the end as those scenes were very dark taking place in an underground railroad of sorts. Normally, in a movie like this there is some humor and here there is only one instance. When T'Challa's mother asks for help from another regional King to help defeat new King M'Baku, he gets annoyed and says he will feed these people to his children. Then he laughs and says, 'No that is not true as we are Vegans' and he continues to laugh at his own joke. Notables: Forest Whitaker as Zuri; Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue; Martin freeman as Everett K. Ross, a CIA agent.Stan Lee makes an appearance at a casino craps table. He is now probably busy writing a sequel.There is very good heart stomping music throughout. The hype was good and the movie delivered and now we wait for the sequels. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

The Greatest Showman," One of the greatest musicals ever
","From humble beginnings P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackson) will come to be known as The Greatest Showman who brought 'a celebration of humanity' to us all. This was said by his staunchest critic James Gordon Bennett (Paul Sparks) a newspaper reporter and he finally admitted that P.T. Barnum gave people the time to smile and enjoy the entertainment. Keep in mind that this is not a story about the Ringling Bros and Barnum Bailey Circus. No, this is the time before all that. This is how P.T. Barnum got started with his museums and later with live human acts and animals that one of his daughters said was needed. She was right. P.T. Barnum went looking for people that other people considered 'freaks.' There was Dog Boy (Luciano Acuna, Jr), the Dwarf: Tom Thumb ( Stan Humphrey), the Bearded Lady (Keala Settle), the World's Fattest Man (Daniel Everidge), and so on. All became a fine circus family and proud of what they did. The entire cast outperformed expectations. Kudos. The lively, toe-tapping music, the singing and precision choreography was, perhaps, the best I have ever seen in a musical and I 've seen many. And yes each song, dance and the accompanying music stayed strong, vibrant and catchy all the time. Nothing dragged including player dialogues as the pacing was spot on throughout. I count this movie in a class by itself, and maintain that this is the greatest musical ever. Watch and judge for yourselves. I was surprised that the whole Barnum team did go and meet Queen Victoria, and Barnum came away with the famous Opera Singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson) and did a tour with her. She was touted as an Opera Singer, but she never sang operatic songs in the movie.Notables: Zac Efron as Phillip Carlyle, a playwright who became part owner in the circus; Michelle Williams as Charity, P.T. Barnum's wife; Ellis Rubin as Young Barnum; Skylar Dunn as Young Charity; Anne Wheeler as Trapeze Artist Zandaya who Phillip Carlyle falls for;  
All in all one of the most enjoyable musicals I have ever seen. As the reporter Bennet begrudgingly considered that P.T. Barnum brought 'a celebration of humanity' to us all, he was also the one who is credited in telling P.T. Barnum to change the name of his show to P.T. Barnum's Circus. 
Maybe there will be another movie later on called The Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Let's hope. (10/10)

Life," Watchable
","Astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) study a one-celled organism from MARS named Calvin. All seems harmless enough until one astronaut decides to wake it up using electricity. Well, that angers Calvin and things go from bad to worse. How would you feel if someone prodded you with a touch of electricity? This was okay and maybe not as good as some previous space movies. The sets within this ISS are visually good. and we liked seeing everyone glide around in zero gravity. The dialogues are low key and one must listen carefully. The music was also low key and didn't make its presence known hardly at all. This could have used more pictures of space, in general, showing the earth from time to time. But wait, Calvin has escaped and there's no time for any of that You would think there would be a lot of tension not knowing where Calvin was at any given moment, but that was not the case here. Concern yes, but no real tension. Here the music could have played a more important role. Didn't happen.It is decided to kill Calvin and not let it get to Earth and destroy civilization. The belief is that this creature was the cause of all devastation on MARS. Well, killing Calvin is easier said than done. This Calvin creature is one smart organism, which, by the way, has now grown quite a bit. (This can't be good.)Now to be fair doing a movie within really tight quarters is hard and this was done in very good fashion. Maybe this had a bearing on everything as it wasn't Star Trek where everyone has a lot of space to move about. The Editing was excellent. There were a few feeble attempts at humor that went nowhere. One thing did surprise me: No one suggested they try to communicate with Calvin. HmmmmThere is nothing scary in here once you get used to Calvin and the CGI is nothing but spectacular. So the rest of the movie has astronauts trying to kill Calvin to insure it doesn't get to Earth.Notable: Ryan Reynolds as Rory and he was the first to try and kill Calvin.No one stands out as the main guy until near the end when David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson) get together and decide how to handle Calvin. And even then it's all even-handed, okay still low key. All In all this is slow-going but watchable. The ending will surprise you as it did me. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

John Wick: Chapter 2," As Good As Advertised
","Top Assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) tries to stay retired, but others won't let him. When asked about it he says, 'I'm working on it.' The movie opens with John Wick getting his car back. Hang on, it's going to be a bumpy ride.Later John Wick is on his way to Rome to repay a debt to fellow Assassin Santino (Richardo Scamarcio)who wants John to kill his sister, Gianna (Claudia Gerini), who will take a seat at the High Table of Assassins. Santino wants that seat. Santino betrays John and puts $7-million bounty on John's head. John Wick needs to end Santino.This movie has been what we were waiting for and it doesn't disappoint. The fight scenes, CGI and fantastic choreography are still staples within this franchise. True, this is somewhat longer than the first John Wick movie as some of the gun battles did go on a little too long. But, hey, this is a John Wick movie and we were prepared.We see more story development in here and it was welcomed and the acting by all is excellent. Almost reminded one of the Bond, James Bond movies. The photography, and cinematography were spot on and the music was heart stomping good. We also see more celebrities in supporting roles. This John Wick thing is catching on. Notables: Ian Mcshane, as Winston, the manager of the Continental Hotel (a safe haven for Assassins) in NYC and later he bans John Wick from his hotel because John killed a man on 'their hallowed grounds.' Common as Cassian, a bodyguard to Gianna; Claudia Gerini as Gianna, the sister of Santino; Laurence Fishburne as BK, the Bowery King who helps John Wick get to Santino; John Leguizamo as Aurelio, John Wick's vehicle body repair man; Ruby Rose as Ares, an Assassin who only spoke in sign language; Bridget Moynahan as Helen in flashbacks as John Wick's deceased wife; and Peter Stormare as Abram who has John Wick's car. At the end we see John Wick actually run away before all the Assassins can try to kill him. Winston gives him a one hour head start and John Wick gives Winston a message for all Assassins if they come after him. and this means we will be seeing John Wick 3. Can't wait. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Sully," Best Line in the movie: Capt Sully tells co-pilot Skiles, 'We did our job.'
","On 15 January 2009, after his engines flame out from bird damage, Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) lands US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River saving all 155 people on board. The beginning of the movie shows a dream sequence by Sully when Flt 1549 crashes into New York buildings, then he wakes up.Later the movie shows the beginning of an investigation by the NTSB of what happened to Sully and flight 1549 on the Hudson River and as we watch we see this committee try to destroy Sully's reputation as it tries to persuade Sully and co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) that there were other options. They claim the computer simulations show they could have made it to Idlewild Airport. They claim the simulations also show the left engine was still idling. Sully says there was no way it could do that. This was hailed the Miracle on the Hudson, but the NTSB didn't see it that way. We see flashbacks of what happens in the cockpit and with the passengers as well just prior to the landing in freezing water. When Flight 1549 hits the water the CGI kicks in and we are most impressed and we let out a 'Wow!' There is no other expression.We are privy to some of the things the public never sees as the NTSB makes its case. Sully demands to be allowed to see the simulations without waiting for the usual time duration that would be imposed. Sully believes the human factor was not considered in these simulations. He knows he did the right thing. Acting and action sequences all around were perfect. And yes I would give Tom Hanks the Oscar for Best Actor and let's not forget Clint Eastwood as Best Director. Kudos. Notables: Jamey Sheridan as Ben Edwards a NTSB member; Laura Linney as Lorraine, Sully's wife.The next best line in here was when NTSB member Anna Gunn as Elizabeth Davis asks co-pilot Skiles what would he have done different if he had it to do all over again. He says, 'I'd do it in July.'

Alien: Covenant," Excellent. It Delivers

A solar storm interrupts the flight and many are released from stasis. Then they hear a distress call and decide to investigate. Of course, you know this is a big mistake. AnywayThey land a shuttle on the planet and discover all is not as Earth- like as was seemed. They encounter Alien life forms that want to devour them. Oh, oh. On the planet they also find David (Michael Fassbender) a survivor from the ship the Prometheus. Now, know this: David is an Android. And you will come to know David as a bad Android. Walter (also Michael Fassbender) a good Android, is on the Covenant and monitors all in stasis. Yes, yes, there will be a battle between them later on.The acting all around is first rate. The CGI is simply unbelievably fantastic , and the sets are awesome. The pacing is good and keeps one alert and searching for other Aliens that may get into the shuttle. One flaw is that when one of the crew got infected by Alien spores he was allowed to go into the shuttle and, of course, he dies. There was no talk of quarantine. Another flaw is that the crew when they were observing the planet from the Covenant, none of the instruments picked out David, who is still there. (You know, Mr Spock wouldn't have let that happen) There are other flaws but to tell you would give too much away, but they don't take away from the entertainment factor here. After we go through Aliens attacking the crew on the ground, another shuttle comes to rescue them and we think all are safe, but guess what? An Alien has attached himself to the shuttle and wants in. Here we go again, but these scenes are truly an art form.. They are so real, you actually believe and cringe away hoping Daniels (Katherine Waterson) aka Danny, who is tethered to the shuttle can dislodge the Alien as Tennessee (Danny McBride) maneuvers the shuttle to shake the Alien off. Great scenes. You will be surprised to learn what David has been doing for the last 10-years. No, I did not forget about the battle between Walter and David. You have to see for yourself.The big twist comes later near the end when all is good and the Covenant is now again on its way to Origae-6 and the crew again go into the stasis pods as there are many more years to go. Danny, now the Captain, is the last to go in and she asks Walter if he will help her build that cabin on the lake when they get there. Then she realizes her mistake and the stasis pod takes over and she goes to sleep. We believe a sequel is in order. I enjoyed this Alien version of Alien movies even though the Aliens were very scary looking and yes, they had big teeth too (That's mandatory) (9/10)Violence: Yes.
