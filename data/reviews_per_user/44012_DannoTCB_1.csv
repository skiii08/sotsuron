The Longest Yard," Remade movies are alright if respect is shown to the original.
","Which this one did almost to a fault. To the point were it was almost a Burt Reynolds homage more than an Adam Sandler vehicle. No specifics, but the smaller characters pretty much made the movie, whether it was the WWE alumni, a heavily disguised Dan Patrick, Nick Toturro or even the actors outside of Bandit, from the original, making cameos. Ironic that Eddy Albert (the original warden) passed away the day before it was released nationally. James Cromwell seems to have created a niche for himself playing authoratative nemesises, and he did the character of the 'bad guy' warden proud.It is a great 'guy' flick. Watch it with the fellas. Then go to Hooters.",2,1,4,30 May 2005
