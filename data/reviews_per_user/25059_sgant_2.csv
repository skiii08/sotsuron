Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Absolutely stunning, action packed, beautiful and awe-inspiring.
","Forget all the people poo-pooing this movie, I thought it was great! What I can't understand is how everyone is saying that the characters are not fully realized or that they're cartoonish and stiff. Did anyone SEE the original Star Wars? Everything being said about Phantom Menace could be said about Star Wars.It was inevitable that this movie is going to be put under a microscope and picked apart mercilessly. It seems that everyone has the 'been-there-done-that' cynical attitude that wasn't so pervasive in the seventies when the original came out. Just go and see the movie for what it is.for what the original was.great entertainment!It's a great ride.",10,0,0,20 May 1999
A Bug's Life," A wonderful movie!
","Another great movie from Pixar. They have that certain touch that makes you laugh out loud, and the finesse to make you say 'wow'. Its cast of goofy characters is another Pixar sign. I also liked seeing the short 'Geri's Game' at the beginning, also produced at Pixar and the winner of 1998's Oscar for Best Animated Short.The only thing I don't like is everyone calling this a Disney movie. Disney did nothing on this movie at all, except distribute it. It's a 100% Pixar production!",Null,0,0,26 November 1998
