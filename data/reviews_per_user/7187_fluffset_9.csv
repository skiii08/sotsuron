Conquest 1453," this is just the Islamic version of Hollywood epic.
","I totally disappointed with this movie, but I still give this movie 5 because I think its not so bad but just its 70% historical inaccuracy that make me quite angry. Some other reviewer try to make quite a stir by saying that Sultan Mehmet is a wine drinker and everything but its not, Sultan Mehmet is the one of the pious Muslim king in the history, just like Salahuddin Ayyubi. He likes to pray a lot, very kind with his people, like to read koran a lot, but they never show this in the movie. Hadith of the Prophet said,'Verily you shall conquer Constantinople. What a wonderful leader will her leader be, and what a wonderful army will that army be!'. And they totally don't describe about how Sultan Mehmet work so hard in his life to produce exactly what prophet have said in order to fit his kingdom with the hadith rather than always yelling at his minister. Actually I've read the biography about the detailed conquest of the Constantinople so I can say that I quite know everything and this movie fail to do so.It looks like they just take some inspiration from 'Kingdom of Heaven','Troy','300','King Arthur' and maybe 'Alexander' to make this movie. How come the queen of Muslim country wear outfit like Penelope Cruz? By the way, this movie is still good but just have no originality and total of historical inaccuracy.",5,0,4,27 April 2016
Gravity," what's up with space & sandra?
","Is this movie overrated? No, since Source Code or Apollo 11 American have been waiting for some good sci-fi movie for so long, so after this one come out with a very interesting idea they suddenly really love this one! I watch this movie because I'm Sandra's fans and of course she is so pretty in this movie although her role is just...decent, not the Oscar-worthy one. For me, just my opinion this movie is just some plain survival-adventure-thriller movie which the miracle always came to save our hero. For sci-fi genre, this movie win but for thriller/suspense this movie is kind of fail. We can predict what will happen next because we always saw this type of movie but in different background and I really don't really care or pay attention about what will happen to the character, seriously. Many incorrect scientific accuracy but who cares? It's fiction so just enjoy this. For the exhilarating cinematography and the beautiful Sandra.",6,7,14,5 October 2013
Aquaman," first DC action-packed!
","Even though I always critic DC and favor Marvel more, I still watch all of them haha. So, for this one, I guess its the best DC movie ever. Its straightforward, easy plot, and total full of action. Unlike Martha, this one is really good! Love all the sea creature!",7,1,1,2 January 2019
Baby Driver," Not what I expected from Edgar Wright...
","I love Shaun, Nick Angel, Scott Pilgrim. They are really awesome! & so funny by the way. I carry my expectation to 'The World's End' and yeah, its OK. So, after all the buzz, the hype and good critics, my expectation is way too high too for this movie. Its my fault to expect a perfect movie, 'Baby Driver' is just a good, cool and stylized action movie. Its OK overall, I like it. I guess this movie will appeal more well to American audience because they know all the old song that have been played in the movie. They might enjoy it better than people from other continent that's not very familiar with the song selection. I love some of the song too but in some scene I think its too much and kind of annoying when its so loud with the help of the cinema audio system. Enough said, just enjoy it, its OK. If you ask me the 'stuff' that I expected from this movie. I just expect some 'hot fuzz' kind of stuff. What can I do? I just love that movie very much.",6,1,2,25 July 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," The coolest Spiderman Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",Look man! I dont expect anything from this movie! It just so cool! So totally exceed my expectation! I just thought this is gonna be like the same old boring DC style animation straight to video! But its not! They are totally serious! They were working so hard to make this animation looks awesome and cool as ever! They just challenge DC man! Way to go Marvel! What a healthy competition!,10,6,10,23 February 2019
1917," Glad to be alive to witness this!
","Sad sad sad war, war bring nothing but misery to humanity. We don't even know if our ancestor died honorably or just died for nothing. To fulfill our leader's pride who just sit on the throne watching us sacrifice our life while he/she eating kentucky. Sam Mendes did a great job depicting the horror of war, we should be afraid of war more than ghost. Because ghost cant do nothing but war do everything. War is not even stop until today, massacre keep happening here and there until we think that human's life is worthless. Just for the sake of thing called oil and money. Everyone must die. Can peace still happen? Or it is just fata morgana?",10,0,3,18 January 2020
Big Hero 6," ugh... not really big okay
","I'm kind of disappointed, its my fault to expecting so much from Disney because they have make a lot of great movie since I was a kid and I love all of them very much, this is my first bad Disney movie I guess. Everyone keep saying 'Mars Needs Mom' is bad but I like it though. Its better than 'Big Hero 6'. The CGI animation is great as always, as expected from Disney but what lack is its story. Its just some plain story though, we can really predict what will happen next, who's the villain, who's gone. Its not exciting at all, then I think the big factor here is comedy, its really lack in sense of humour, its not funny at all, I don't even laugh a bit with fluffy marshmallow, weird Fred or confusing Wasabi. I think this one is really purposely made for kid only. We adult can enjoy 'Frozen', 'Wreck-It-Ralph' and 'Bambi' but we can't take Big Hero 6 though. I mean not all of us because I think some adult still like this movie, but seriously with just one time viewing is enough for all of our life. Its OK.",5,10,58,17 February 2015
The Conjuring," overrated like hell!!
","They lied to us! A lot of reviewer lied to us by giving this movie an excellent rating while this movie is just an ordinary clich√© everyday American horror movie. I do loves James Wan because of his Saw and Insidious, and maybe I'm Asian so ghost stories about pulling leg while asleep or ghost bite is kind of classic story in our country that always happened. Everyone keep saying that this movie is his masterpiece but its totally not, Insidious is better. Why? Easy because its more horrific than Conjuring and I'm really afraid like hell with Insidious but feel nothing with Conjuring. If you want some good exorcist movie you can try The Exorcist, I hope for his next horror movie he will just use his buddy, Whannel as a scriptwriter because he really know on how to make some new horror flick and always give us a clever twist in the end than this true story that have no twist and too straightforward. 6-7 are what this movie deserved. Watchable for horror fans.",6,1,2,11 August 2013
Furious 7," audience love fun by the way
","I'm not really a fan of this franchise, but I have watch all its series, because I just love to see a blockbuster I guess? For me, the best Fast & Furious (F&F) series is the first,Tokyo Drift and fourth and I really love that Japanese one, because I think that's the only F&F movie that's really focus on the car. Other than that, just like everyday action crime movie that involve some car chase? This one, its just getting more ridiculous and logically impossible since 'Fast Five', where I think F&F start to lose its sense. The only problem here is Dom, he is so immortal and have the highest confidence ever. He will do a lot of dangerous stuff and will not die out of it, not even a scratch on his neck appear. Actually, this is not his fault anyway, its the writer who wrote this weak script. But I think its OK, they just got 1.3 billion anyway. One thing I think they need to have if they want to make this movie better is, a twist. Because everything happen in this movie is so predictable, we know that Dom & his crew will be alive, the one who died is just some extra who doesn't have any dialogue at all. They need to make this movie more exciting, thrilling and unpredictable. I guess the only unpredictable scene that happen in this movie is in Abu Dhabi, other than that, you can see it in every F&F movie. You ask why this thing got 1.3 billion, the answer is fun.",5,1,16,14 May 2016
