Ford v Ferrari," Amazing editing, phenomenal casting and amazing story
","I never cared much about racing competitions, and yet this movie pushed me to some researches on Le Mans competition on 1966, the year when Ford won for the first time the race.Technically speaking is amazing, racing scenes are amazingly directed, you can feel the tension after every curve, during every overtaking and on every duel. This is how car racing scenes are supposed to be done. The photography is extremely dynamic and immersive, you feel part of the competition. For sure one of the most successful direction of 2019.The movie tells the story of the creation of the car that will beat Ferrari in Le Man, showing the whole process, and it does so in an original and inspired way. Two hours and a half flew away. It was a satisfying experience. Characters are really well developed and you can easily bound with them. Every one has the right space on screen.'Ford v. Ferrari' is for sure one of the best movie of its category from the last year and I really liked how Christian Bale and Matt Damon portrayed the friendship between Shelby and Miles.",9,2,3,27 February 2020
The Irishman," A good movie, but definitely not a masterpiece
","Scorsese is a god among directors, he made a lot of movies that are big classic such as Goodfellas and Taxi Drivers. Even his most recent jobs, such as The Wolf of Wall Street and Boardwalk Empire are memorable. So, when The Irishman was announced I was hyped.I logged in my Netflix account a few days after the release date, and I started watching it. A lot of people said that the movie is too long, 3 hours and a half are in fact way above the average, and my suggestion would be to pick a day where you don't have anything to do and enjoy it. I never felt bored and even if, especially in the end, you may feel the weight of its length, there is always something going on screen. It is just another way to tell the story. Nowadays cinema is too fast, sometimes we need this old style storytelling, that takes his time to develop characters and events in the proper way. Unfortunately the attention span decreased a lot from the audience and speaking with friends and colleagues, a lot of them were not able to watch it all at once. A real shame, because this movie need to be tasted slowly and you need to appreciate every single gradient of the story. Very well curated and very dynamic.The other big critic is the CGI used to rejuvenate actors. I have to tell that critiques are not completely wrong on this. The work done is... decent, but not perfect. For example, I did not understand why they needed to edit so heavily De Niro's eyes while he was young. And you can see that even if they are young, the movement from actors it is slower than expected. There, even the most advanced technology cannot do much. Anyway, I think that too much importance was given to this aspect of the movie, this is not the reason why you are watching this movie, it is not a Marvel movie, so even if special effects are not perfect, you can easily forgive them.Even if the movie is well done, we are not at the same level of big classic such as Goodfellas. Don't get me wrong, I liked how Scorsese portrayed the mob during the 70's, and also the rise and the fall of the Irishman, but when you have setted the standard so high with your previous movies, it is difficult to do better. Scorsese is a Master and we are lucky enough to see him alive and to keep producing and directing this kind of productions, even if they are not trending anymore in the mainstream cinema. Sometimes is good to have a reminder how cinema used to be.",7,5,6,28 December 2019
Aquaman," Seems more a videogame than a movie
","When it comes to 'Aquaman' it is hard to write an opinion. The CGI is amazing, visually speaking, is stunning, I liked the representation of Atlantis and its creatures, it seems a scifi city, but underwater, being a fan of futuristic stuff. I simply loved it and I think that is one of the best SFX that I've watched recently. The problem is that, exactly like in 'Man of Steel', the movie is overloaded of computer generated images. In fact you there are more CGI, than filmed scenes. You really wonder why they didn't just made an animation movie in motion capture. I can understand that the underwater location is actually very difficult to create stunt scenes, but with a budget of 160 million dollars (source: IMDb movie page), they could have come up with something.Costumes are simply horrible. I don't even know who approved them. Soldier costumes are a mix between a space suit and a diver suit. Without any doubt, the lowest point is Black Manta. It seems a bug, that you can easily crush. I laughed when I saw it. The actor that played him was really bad, not credible as a villain. They should definitely make better casting decision in Warner Bros. Speaking of which, I was really disappointed by Patrick Wilson, I think that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood and I watched many movies starring him, such as the entire saga of 'The Conjuring', 'Insidious' and I loved his interpretation in 'Watchmen', so he even has already experience with superhero movies. In 'Aquaman' was underwhelming and not credible at all as a villain, even less than Black Manta. He didn't even tried to create a credible character: no personality and no charisma. Jason Momoa is the usual supermacho guy that will always be stuck in this kind of roles, exactly like Vin Diesel, but at least this was a good choice, and actually I liked him playing Arthur.The DC Extended Universe has a lot of potentialities, but they are simply wasting it. Stop doing movies drugged of CGI like this one or 'Justice League', give us some real actions, more stunts scenes like in 'Wonder Woman', or 'Shazam!' Stop creating this mindless movies with always the same story, try at least something different, as in 'Batman V. Superman'. DC is capable to create good movies if it wants to, and I have reported three valid examples. Let's only hope that the second Wonder Woman and 'Birds of Prey' movies, will be good.",5,1,3,19 November 2019
Deadpool 2," An excellent sequel for a fun franchise
","Doing a good sequel seems impossible nowadays for Hollywood, but Deadpool 2 is an exception. As always Ryan Reynolds portrayed this antihero wonderfully: he's humorous, irreverent but he can also be lovely. In this movie his character was deepen and we discover more of his personality, confirming once again what I had already expressed in the review of the first movie: there is no other character like Deadpool in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and for me these two movies with Guardians of the Galaxy are the only ones that are really worth to be watch, because they are different and really intriguing.This time we are also introduced to new heroes, such as Domino or Bedlam, that are a nice addition, even if they don't have much time on screen. Very weak the performance of Julian Dennison as Firefist. He is in fact really annoying and he is used only as a pretext to go on with the story. Honestly, creators here could have done a better job. I was personally very disappointed by the final fights that could not catch me much, as seems just another, generic battle against the super villain. I need however to say that the story and the narration were not at all obvious and there a few plot twists that I was not expecting at all.For cinema lovers Deadpool movies are a must, even for people that does not love this genre:they are different and refreshing, you don't need to watch any Marvel movie before it, because it is a standalone movie. Even if X-Men are mentioned, don't worry, you don't need to watch the whole X-Men saga. There are many references to the pop culture, such as other movies or music. If you are able to catch them, the movie is even funnier.",7,1,1,9 January 2020
Ready Player One," A movie that manages to collect most of the pop and nerd culture from the 80's, until today
","I did not read the book, so unfortunately I cannot compare the source material to the cinematic adaptation.The CGI sequences were really well made and as a fellow gamer, I have to say that were really immersive and it seemed to be really watching people playing. OASIS is stunning: the art direction is really good, locations are very well made, fights scenes are intense. This is exactly what I was expecting from a movie of this kind. The story is intriguing with interesting plot twists that will mix together the virtual and real words together. Even if the plot is not the most original one, the way it is narrated is different than the average Hollywood action movie. 'Ready Player One' manages to collect references to pop and gaming culture, starting from the 80s, until today: more or less 40 years in one single movie.After many attempts from Hollywood to create movies inspired from video games (like Resident Evil), that failed miserably, this one seems to be the real first movie related to games that aims perfectly to the objective: be entertaining, funny and have a good story.",7,0,1,18 January 2020
Suicide Squad," How a superhero movie should be made
","At the beginning we are introduced to the Suicide Squad. Presentation sequences for all the members are not long, but detailed enough to understand the origin of every 'villain', and more information will be added along the movie. The cast is composed by great names, Will Smith and Margot Robbie are the two that pops immediately in my head, but also Jay Courtney as Captain Boomerang with his scottish accent, and Jay Hernandez as El Diablo performed pretty good.Jared Leto's Joker deserve a different paragraph. I don't really know what to think about it: there were some moments during the movie in which I found him brilliant, but most of the time it seemed too forced in his acting and not at all convincing. I have to admit that I have watched this movie after 'The Dark Knight' (I don't think that there are any words that can describe how amazing was Heath Ledger) and the Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' 2019 movie. I perfectly understand that are completely different, darker. Maybe they wanted to create something closer to the pop culture and they wanted to play a little bit safer this time. However, I can't say that I appreciated the interpretation: the character is annoying and I could not bound with, or feeling any kind of emotion for him.There is a good mix between CGI and stunts scenes and in general, under this perspective the entire movie is very balanced. We get to see the right amount of destruction (that needs to be there in a superhero movie), but at least they did not raze to the ground an entire city like in 2013 'Man of Steel'. The fight scenes seems credible and dynamic, but the movie leave also space for some dialogues between characters, developing them, even though not everyone has the importance that should have, like Killer Croc. He seems that he does not have any personal story, and he was left aside, so you almost forget is part of the team.Suicide Squad is a big step forward compared to the other DC movies and is worth your time, it feels different, looks amazing, with of course some weak points, and I never thought that I could give seven stars out of ten to this movie. I was pleasantly surprised.",7,0,0,22 October 2019
Baby Driver," Creative editing and great action scenes, with spectacular car chases and well directed shootouts
","Baby Driver is not the most original or innovative movie out there, but accomplished to entertain and while I was watching it, I was never bored. Action scenes are amazingly directed, music and editing are synced and very creative, it is a different way to mix music and images. The result are dynamic and funny scenes. Technically speaking I don't have any complaint, the editing is fluid and smart.The story is pretty basic, something that has been seen in the cinema history many, many times. There are no plot twists, no clever or particular smart scenes that are worth to be remembered, but honestly I was not expecting something deeper. We are talking a movie that make you spend two hours, if you have some time to kill and if you don't want to watch something too challenging and just chill.",6,2,2,3 March 2020
Justice League," A missed opportunity for the most important movie in the DC Extended Universe
","'Justice League' brings together the most iconic superheroes of DC comics to defeat evil once again. So, this should have been the most important movie in the DC Extended Universe, it should have been something different, original and with charismatic and memorable characters.The plot is always the same, an evil mastermind wants to destroy the Earth and conquer the universe. I don't even want to criticize this, obviously if Hollywood keeps doing movie with a story seen already many times, it means that is a formula that works and sells. So let's take a quick look to characters, I really liked Batman and Wonder Woman, for me the best two heroes in the Justice League. Flash was just okay, he just add a little bit of comedy in the movie, but that's all, he never stands out. Comprehensible, being his first ride as a superhero, but honestly you forget him easily. Cyborg is the guy that is taking care of all the technological stuff, basically a war machine. Aquaman, a useless character, the final battle is in fact located in a complete dried location, so he cannot even use his powers at best. And last, but not least Superman, that will come back, just to be in some filler scenes and in the last 5 minutes of the final battle and only because all the other heroes were struggling.In the end I've understood that everything could have been solved by Superman alone, so all the other characters are basically useless. Honestly from this movie I was really expecting more: I am a fan of the DC Extended Universe but, in this case I just watched the average superhero movie pumped with CGI and very few practical stunts scenes. A big step back from 'Batman V. Superman', which started to give me hope about this cinematic universe.",5,0,1,17 November 2019
Man of Steel," First attempt from DC to create a cinematic universe (failed miserably)
","Man of Steel should be the genesys of Superman. The first part is very interesting, because it tells the origin of Kent Clark, by showing little by little how he was found by his adoptive parents, and how he grew up on Earth. The second part show the big battle between him and Captain Zod.Action scenes are really well done, but I think that fights are made 90% of CGI and I could not feel that sense of realism that I had with Wonder Woman, where there are a lot of stunts action too. I know that Man of Steel was made before, but budget was clearly enough to create a more credible movie.The transition of Clark Kent from a normal individual into Superman is really unsettling: he just wore a premade suit and that's it. In the first movie of Spiderman trilogy, directed by Sam Raimi, there was a nice transition of the character, you could see that he started to make his first costume alone, and then slowly, he came up with the design that everybody know. It was part of the journey, and helped me to bound more with the character. In this case, they decided to fill the last hour of the movie with fight scenes that will lead to the complete destruction of an entire city. This is too much and if you were searching for a movie that tells the origin of one of the most iconic comics character, this is definitely not the one.",5,0,1,20 October 2019
Divergent," Just another action movie for teenager
","This review will contain many spoilers regarding the story.Divergent is a movie with good premises, but since the beginning you already know that you are not going to watch an original movie. In fact for the whole duration I had a sense of Deja-vu: set in a dystopian future, after the ending of 'The War' (?), the Chicago population is divided into 5 different factions. Everyone need to be fitted in one of these categories or you will end up as a homeless and factionless individual rejected by everyone. In order to decide which section you belong, you need to perform a test that tells which is the best faction for you, but during the ceremony day you get to decide which is the best option for you. Our main character is Tris, that during the test seems to belong to more factions. These people are called Divergents and cannot be controlled. They are considered really dangerous from the society and as soon as they detect one, they simply kill them.So, another movie that tells that nobody belongs to a fitted category, that anyone should think with their own brain, and should have their own idea. Nothing original, but premises remains okay. The main issue of this movie is the lenght: almost 2 hours and a half. The first hour is focused on Tris, that after choosing the Dauntless faction, basically the group dedicated to protect the population, tries to integrate herself inside the faction in the best way possible, even if she is clearly not fitted, a thing that insted of being slow cooked, could have been resolved with a short montage, or, if the director felt the need to elaborate on, in a 20 minutes sequence, saving the viewer from the boredom. Finally the story begins and everything is so predictable, including the love story with his trainer, that is in the air since the first moment they met. The main villain is an erudite that want to genocide an entire faction that manage the city, so she, with her faction can finally take over the government. In my opinion she is not very credible as a villain and in the end was also pretty easy to defeat.The acting is very flat, Shailene Woodley has the same expression for the whole movie, you cannot tell the diffference between happiness and sadness on her face and when she acts, she use always the same way of speaking. Theo James is the same. I wonder who did the casting and how they could pick so poor actors, especially if we are talking about the main ones.I will try to watch the complete trilogy, before saying that the entire saga is completely unworth to be watched, but this movie is in fact very predictable: it uses a narrative scheme very well known and that you see a lot nowadays. It is a brainless Hollywood movie made for early teenagers (like 14/15 years old, maximum), if, of course, they manage to go through the entire movie.I gave 4 stars out if 10 because CGI is on point and I really liked this distopian world. Also allucinations inducted by a special serum, are well studied.",4,1,2,15 September 2019
Toy Story 4," The end of a beautiful saga
","This saga has more or less my same age, and it is amazing that Pixar decided to end this it after 24 years, with an ending that does justice to the entire franchise. They did a really good job: the fourth movie is an amazing adventure to rescue a new toy. We find all the old toys that we love, plus some new funny characters that will make the movie worth to be watched.I also like the setting: it is different and fresh, something that in previous movies we did not saw, a gigatic open world that made possible to develop more narrative options, all this by keeping the same animation style, mixing something new, with something old. The result is a movie that entertains because easygoing and funny.I have to be honest: I was a little bit skeptical about this Toy Story 4. This is a movie that is part of the childhood of many, many people, so Pixar had to pay a lot of attention, the probability to ruin this saga were pretty high, considering also the latest remakes that Disney is releasing, but in the end they made esomething unique and I have to really thank creators for this gift. I will miss these characters, but it is better to end the story here. The perfect conclusion, for one of the most beautiful and game changing animation movies of all time.",7,3,4,15 September 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A journey into 60's Hollywood era
","Quentin Tarantino delivers once again a good movie, even if it is not for sure the best one. I still think that 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Django' are unbeatable (for now), from every point of view, but this is just my personal taste.I have enjoyed this change of style, but I can understand that hardcore Tarantino fans are disappointed by its last job. Personally I was expecting too more violence as in 'Inglourious Basterds' or 'Reservoir Dogs', but I didn't mind at all the change in storytelling. 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' is a journey throughout the 60's Hollywood era. Tarantino decided to use the radio car to deep dive on those years, we always listen to some famous songs from the 60's, we always watch some small pieces of movies and TV series of the time, locations feel authentic, cars are beautiful and clothes are accurate. A director should also be able to change itself, and in my opinion Tarantino did goodThere is a good chemistry between Dicaprio and Pitt. Their relationship is very important and will evolve. Characters are in general very interesting and there are many big names involved such as Al Pacino and Margot Robbie. There are beautifully conceived scenes and I really liked to see Dicaprio portraying Bronco, it was funny and different.In my opinion to fully appreciate the movie, you need to do some researches on the 60's and especially trying to dig a little bit on the Manson family facts and researching what really happened that fatal night.I really enjoyed the movie and I strongly recommend it.",7,1,3,27 January 2020
Midsommar," A journey inside pagan rituals
","Ari Aster makes movies that are not for everyone, even people that love the horror genre, can be bored by its length. This is his style: really slow paced stories, I saw it in 'Hereditary', I saw it also here. To fully appreciate his movies you need to like technical stuff, such as the framing and photography. We can almost speak about sperimental cinema, but that sells pretty well, considering the genre. Maybe because is the first director that is bringing something new to horror and thriller, after a long time, and people are simply curious.The story is really simple: a group of guys is invited by a swedish friend to participate to a pagan festival in his small village, but soon, they will find themselves in a dangerous situation. It seems to stay in a trip: the location is very mystical and dark, even if the director decided to use warm colors: it is a nice contrast, because from one side is reassuring, but shots make often feel you uneasy. There are many scenes that are uncomfortable, and create a lot of tension. However this movie cannot really scare you: it makes feel anxious, it triggers some inner fears, and maybe it was this the purpose of 'Midsommar'. This is why, at least for me, it is way better than the average horror/thriller production. There are no jump scares (my prayers have been answered, finally). The sound part is very well done, and to fully appreciate this film, I highly recommend to watch it with a pair of good headphones. The sound in fact is very realistic and you can hear every single sound (including music) as the character that appears on screen hears: when the character is far from the music, the music is lower, but it becomes higher and higher while is approaching, or when he/she moves from one place to another, the sound pass from the right channel, to the left one. A nice detail that improve even more the technical quality.Acting was just okay, the main character Dani, played by Florence Pugh, was convincing and I actually need to praise her job, because there were some scenes that were obviously really hard to shoot, I genuinely believe that she gave the best that she could. Unfortunately I cannot say the same thing about Jack Reynor, as Christian, the bad boyfriend that does not care about the girlfriend. The problem is that is not good in playing him: he seems more a coward that does not know how to reply, when he has verbal confrontations with her. Regarding the rest of the cast, I can't say that I was impressed.'Hereditary' remains for now the best Aster's job, cast choices were way much better, character were more credible and in general it was scarier and darker than this one. The director decided to take a different approach, but topics are almost the same, in both movie there is a cult, some pagan rituals and witchcraft. The location is different but conceptually speaking are very close to each other. Next time maybe we will be able to see another theme.",6,0,1,20 November 2019
Joker," The genesis of the most iconic DC universe villain
","Joker is one of the best movies of 2019, and confirmed once again that the DC cinematic universe is not for everyone, because their films usually make you think. Joker is a critique to modern society and Artur is the product of it, because is a guy, with a very difficult life, considered by everyone as a freak. But one day, tired of abuses he decide to act, to go against those same people that were mistreating him and to obtain his personal revenge. It shows how evil this society could be with the unprivileged people and it pushes to make a conscience analysis on yourself.I was surprised by the actor choice: Joaquin Phoenix is not the Joker that you expect, he is pretty 'old' to portray the origin of the this villain, and after I watched the trailer for the first time I was pretty skeptic about it. All doubts dissolved once I got out from the cinema: casting made the right choice and his interpretation was amazing: the way he moves, he speaks, he behaves, describe really well the character and the descent into madness.I will say no more, because I don't want to spoil anything: go to the cinema, if you can, enjoy the full experience: dialogues, action scenes and especially the music.",9,1,3,15 October 2019
Hitch," Rewatched this movie after 10 years, it aged pretty good
","Romantic comedies are not really my cup of tea, and I simply avoid them. However sometimes, when your girlfriend wants to watch these kind of movies, you need to find something that you can eventually like. So, while I was exploring the Comedies Netflix catalogue, suddenly appears 'Hitch', movie that I have already watched 10 years ago. Usually I do not expect much from a Rom-Com, but in this case, they managed to tell a nice story, that teach an important lesson about love.Case was nice: Will Smith as usual is very charismatic and he did a good job in portraying this kind of playboy 2.0. He has many good moments during the movie and you can easily bound with his character because he lived many common and relatable situations during the movie. The acting is on point and he is amazing for the whole movie. I want also to praise the job of Kevin James that really made me laugh for the whole movie. Finally Eva Mendes, that in this movie is surprisingly good in her acting. A real shame that she left the acting career in 2014 and she never came back.",7,1,1,12 January 2020
Parasite," An incredible movie with one of the best plot twist ever realized
","I was very hyped about this movie since the trailer was released. I did not know what to expect. The story is brilliant and I never once felt bored, the more I was going on with the movie, the more I was intrigued by it, and I wanted to know what would happen in the next scene. Character development is amazing: every character has his own personality, they have their own psychological profile, and you can immediately bound with them, because they look humans.Kim, a young boy part of a poor and unprivileged family, one day receive a job offer from his friend, to work as a private English tutor for the daughter of a rich korean family. The guy, that starts to earn a lot of money, will then involves his family, in order to earn even more money and be without debts. The entire family manage will work for them. In order to obtain that, they will use illegal strategies. These strategies are so well conceived by the movie, that even me felt tricked at a certain point.The cast did an amazing job by being so expressive, a good performance that for sure helped to win the so earned Palme D'Or to Cannes Festival. Parasite is a movie that will put you on front a of different moral dilemmas and sometimes, you don't really know which side to take.For sure one of the best movies of the year. Make yourself a favor and watch it is really worth it.",8,0,3,2 January 2020
Wonder Woman," Wonderful start, ends to be the average superhero movie
","Don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed the Wonder Woman movie, I think it was very well conceived: the Amazons island was stunning and action scenes, are breathtaking. Camera movement are very dynamics and slow motion is placed at the right moment.Movie is setted during the First World War. Diana is forced to see the cruelty of the it. She is a fighter in every sense, not only with her superpowers, but also with words: she always argue with humans about injustices of the world, but the only one that really understand her is Steve. The chemistry between the two is amazing, and their relationship will have many beautiful and funny moments.The main issue with the movie is the ending: after many wonderfully conceived scenes, with the perfect mix between CGI and stunts actions, the movie finishes with the classic boss fight, that we are already used to see in a Marvel movie and that was, personally speaking, completely unsettling. I was waiting for something different, but in the end director decided to play safe. After watching Shazam!, I think that the DC Extended Universe has a lot of potential, but as we already know through the years, it had many difficulties to rise, Marvel has definitely more experience, but it tends to create always those empty and repetitive movies, while DC, at least for me, has more beautiful stories. They just need to understand how to develop something that really differs and I think that with Joker (2019), they are finally going in the right direction.",6,1,1,19 October 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A slow burning story, with an amazing villain and right mix between fights and dialogues
","Batman V. Super is a movie that either you like or don't. The slow burning story that tells how Batman and Superman become enemies is very interesting, and different from the average superhero movie. I personally like the Jesse Eisenberg interpretation as Lex Luthor, I am a huge fan of his work since 'The Social Network'.The movie is very well balanced, there is the right amount of dialogues and fight scenes, and beside some issues especially close to the end (I am referring to the famous Martha thing, who watched the movie, knows what I am talking about), it is very entertaining and I did not got bored, even if the film was three hours long. Compared to Man of Steel, this was a huge step forward for Snyder. There are still some big CGI sequences, but at least this time he made more stunts and practical action scenes, exactly what I expect for movie of this kind.Regarding the story itself, I have to say that opens a lot of opportunities for future movies. Batman V. Superman, at least for me is the real key to create an interesting narrative universe, and DC is taking the right path. I really hope that one day, they can reach the same quality of the MCU.",6,1,5,25 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A different perspective on war
","Jojo Rabbit is a movie that offers a complete different perspective on war. It is the finest example of satire in latest years, even if it mock tragic events it manages still to be respectful. Instead of showing a realistic view World War 2, with gruesome scenes, director Taika Waititi decided to take a colorful direction, with close to no explicit violence. Little by little becomes darker, showing the tragedy of the war and how much sufference this can bring.Photography is amazing, I like when directors go unconventional, and for some aspects the style reminded me a lot 'Grand Hotel Budapest' and 'The King's Speech', two movies that I have loved. Cast made an excellent job, especially Roman Davis, that was always on point with his german accent. I really liked the Adolf Hitler parody, very few interpretations were able to make me sincerely laugh so much. It is a nice example of comedy and a lot of people in the cinematography world, should take note.Beware, Jojo Rabbit might seem a colorful and funny movie, but it has really important and inspiring message. It made me think a lot about war and his injustices, Together with the italian movie 'La Vita è Bella', are the most beautiful war movie ever made. A real gem, and it deserved every single prize that won.",10,1,2,25 February 2020
Midway," Fast and Furious: Midway Edition
","I was not expecting much from 'Midway'. As soon as I watched the trailer I already knew that this was going to be a bad movie, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.Technically, the movie is awful on every aspect: impossible explosions, unrealistic airplanes monoeuvres and incredibly bad action in general. Some green screen scenes are terrible. From an Hollywood movie you are expecting more, considering the budget. After 20 years Pearl Harbour has better effects and cinematography and still today remains one of the best and solid movie about that period. This movie reminded me the Fast and Furious saga, that I always avoid.Cast was good and overall the acting part is solid. No surprises here, there were a lot of well known actors, so at least characters are credible and entertaining. If you exclude fights battle (that are the 80% of the movie), the remaining 20% is well conceived: the movie is extremely balanced as shows the perspective of both americans and japanes, deepening some aspects that other movies such as Pearl Harbour or the original 1976 Midway, did not take in consideration, because too political and on the side of Uncle Sam.I was not expecting a masterpiece, but neither this garbage. There are for sure better movies about the Midway battle.",4,11,18,1 March 2020
The Truman Show," A classic from the 90's, almost a prediction of modern times
","First time I watched this movie was when I was 12. A the time I did not have the tools to completely understand the movie and the message behind it. My girlfriend never watch it, so I took advantage. Jim Carey is surprisingly good and so much different than any other movie: he is less comedic, he does not do his typical funny and strange faces like in 'Ace Ventura' or 'The Mask'. He was always a very versatile actor. But I consider this one one of his best one, still today.'The Truman Show' was made in a period in which television was deeply changing, where reality shows were exploding as a genre. I have always considered this production as a critique of this kind of empty and useless form of entertainment, that unfortunately became so popular and still today is very important for so many networks, as a lot of people watch them. Truman is a prisoner of this kind of entertainment (as a lot of people are), the only difference is that he did not have any choice, while common people can always to turn off the TV. The concept is very original and in my opinion way ahead of many productions at the time.Actors are phenomenal and you can actually see how much fake characters around Truman are, while the main character seems to be the only genuine one, that wants to escape from that golden prison, just to explore the world and reuniting with the true love of his life. This difference is very well highlighted.'The Truman Show' is not a movie to underestimate: it may seem a light-hearted, but in reality is far away from that. Managing to treat an important topic like this one, without too much drama and with a brilliant storytelling like this, is not easy at all.",8,0,0,2 February 2020
Deadpool," Never thought that a superhero movie could be so entertaining
","'Deadpool' is really different than the usual Marvel movie. After watching the all the 23 movies of the Infinity Saga, I think that in the end they were more or less all with the same narrative structure, except from Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 1 and 2, that were slightly different and had unusual and funny characters.Deadpool is different, he is not the classic good superhero that saves the world from a supervillain that wants to conquest the entire galaxy, he is nor a bad or a good guy and his fight against evil is personal. He doesn't need to fight for humanity, he is a crazy antihero that just wants to live a normal life (more or less). Ryan Reynolds was the perfect pick, he is funny and refreshing. He breaks the 4th wall several times during different scenes. A smart move from the director to keep the audience captured for the whole movie.I never thought that I could give 8 stars out of 10 to a superhero movie, but this one for me, is really worth to be watched.",8,0,2,8 January 2020
