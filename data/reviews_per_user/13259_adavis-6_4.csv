The Ring," Frustrating but good.
","*Possible spoilers* What can one truly say about the Ring?  On the one hand it was frustrating.  The relationship between the Samara, Aiden and Rachel is not explained well.  Why did Samara choose to speak to Aiden?  Why was it important for Rachel to pull the remains of Aiden from the well?  Why does Noah get whacked?  After all, he helped solve the mystery. I would think he would be on the inner track with Samara.  And why does Rachel make copies of the tape for distribution?  There is no indication that she is compelled to do this.  The whole thing is not explained well enough in my view.  I understand that we want to leave some of this to our own interpretations but there is always the possibility that by leaving too much we become frustrated.  This film comes very close to that line.On the other hand it was disturbing.  I have to admit that as I went to bed after watching it I had a far-fetched tiny little fear that my TV set might suddenly pop on.  If it had, I guarantee that I would they probably would have found me in the morning with that same twisted look of fear on my face as the people in the film.  It was disturbing enough for me that it was just a little bit harder to feel completely comfortable in the dark. The whole sequence where Samara comes out of the well and walks towards the `camera' is totally creepy by any interpretation.   If the goal was to leave images in the mind that continue to creep you out for days after you saw the film, then the filmmakers succeeded in that respect.  I think for that reason you can forget about the frustration and have a good time with this one.",Null,0,0,31 March 2003
Pi," Art for art's sake
","Between the film techniques, the imagery, the soundtrack, the references to so many different theories and beliefs it would be difficult to try to either diagram the story, or squeeze it into a haiku.  Pi is a difficult film to nail down so do not try.  Do not try to analyze, do not try to pick apart, and do not question it.  Just relax and let it flow over you.  It is art simply film art for art's sake.  Recognize it as such.",Null,0,1,6 March 2003
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Rare Artistry
","Nightmare Before Christmas was a ground-breaking movie for what it did in the way of animation, and for the bizarre plot line that had never been done before, nor will probably ever be done again.  After all, who would have thought such a thing as a skeleton taking over Christmas?I don't think a lot of people `got it'.  It is difficult for some to just sit back and appreciate something for it's artistic value alone.  So many look to be spoon fed 100% excitement during the entire hour an a half of any film before they like it.In my humble opinion, almost ten years later the film holds up.  I believe that its value is in the creativity of both the screenplay and the musical score.  This is true art.  Tim Burton and Danny Elfman were able to put something very rare together with this movie.",9,0,1,27 January 2003
Signs," Deeper meaning
","I hear many criticize Signs because of perceived flaws in the plot: the aliens would not have landed on a planet 7/10 water; why did Graham have no guns to protect his family; an advanced civilization would wear protective suits when they came to land etc.I believe that in order to appreciate the film you have to back off the analysis of the technical aspects and give it some leeway for minor holes in the plot and see that the story really is about.  It is an illustration of Divine Providence. Once the viewer sees this, he can appreciate the film for what it truly is.  I found it to be a very poignant illustration of this sometime difficult to comprehend spiritual doctrine.",8,0,1,27 January 2003
