10 Cloverfield Lane," Much better than the 2008 'Cloverfield' movie, this is about a gripping & intense story and raw tension rather than special effects and crushing things.
","If this is going to be an anthology or if this is going to be followed by that rumored third installment that has been recently spoiled by J.J. Abrahms, I can say that nobody doubts about the secretly marketed '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a great movie on its own. And a movie that if it were spoiled by someone here or at any review would be cruel.Since the start it reveals to be a movie that doesn't hide an ace, but a hundred.The pace can be a little slow at the first half only to add more and more tension, hooking the audience and introducing them into the movie like they were one of the people inside that bunker.John Goodman will be a real trend the future days thanking its superb performance. He's so twisty, complex developed character. He and Mary Elisabeth Winstead make the movie shine alongside the story.The story is so little, then so game-changer, with twists and turns that are smart rather than empty. It's one of that makes you guess all the time.The ending is more of a bang than a whimper. Even when it succumbs to the action and polemic moves, it will leave you on a grim and high note, pestering for another outing if it's any good like this.If the 'Cloverfield' that started it all was about speaking without breath and CGI scares, this '10 Cloverfield Lane' is about deeper intentions, deeper tension and personal stuff that is scarier than a giant monster. While the connection to that movie is not so remarkable until the finale, this installment is so brilliant on its own, so well marketed (without ruining any twist) and so well ended that will surely please any viewer who were looking for a damn good movie. This is a scary movie like the classic ones. Don't miss it.",9,210,356,10 March 2016
Skyfall," Skyfall is actually a great movie!
","Okay, this is not the best Bond movie ever. That is Casino Royale (that is a so classic Bond movie that works in everything). But Skyfall doesn't have to receive bad reviews just for that thing.It's actually a great movie. Amazingly entertaining, simply, easy to follow and with stunning performances overall. It has its flaws, its mistakes and the script needs a little of a more personal touch and complexity but it's a perfect movie experience and one of the very best entries of this everlasting series. Also the villain portrayed by Javier Bardem is a true hard role and one of the best bad guys of the series ever.Daniel Craig stills rocking as the best Bond ever!",10,1,8,30 November 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men movie Yet! Believe It
","I was so intrigued about this movie. I had a terrible feeling of disappointment because First Class was absolutely fine and riveting. That one was even better than X-Men 2 (the last one directed by Brian Singer before this). So I tried to went to see this with low expectation. And what a wonderful entertainment and surprising thoughtful story I found here. Days Of Future Past is the best X-men movie so far for two main reasons:Fans of the original trilogy and First Class will definitely enjoy this one thanking its nostalgia and its perfect and well balanced mix between the original characters and the new ones (with just a few ones who maybe deserved more credit, but is not at all a problem for the movie). & This movie delivers a surprising top notch entertaining with a potent story and some good twists that help to live up expectations mixed with terrific special effects and cinematography. 3-D is very cool here.The actors are fantastic. Fassbender and McAvoy still delivering amazing performances meanwhile Stewart and Mckellen give their reflections in the same excellent way that in the trilogy. Hugh Jackman finally finds his character as a true important one in comparison with the last movies. Wolverine/Logan finally has a proper treatment in this movie that will help anyone who could be annoyed with his solo adventures to love him again. They are the five main stars of the story with the inclusion of a spectacular and skillful Mystique (impressive Jennifer Lawrence who steals almost every scene of hers) who is undoubtedly the sixth one. The other actors made good performances and make possible the transitions of the story until the amazing finale.It has been so many comparisons with The Avengers. Let me tell you something with all my respect. I found this one truly better. X-Men: Days of Future Past will please the fans and moviegoers and will inject fresh blood and joy to the franchise. This is a terrific time at the movies. Don't miss the opportunity to see it.",10,374,539,12 May 2014
Batman Begins," Great Trilogy Opener!
","My own parents guide: Sex & Nudity: 1/10. Very poor content of this, and just passionate kisses and some innuendo. Violence & Gore: 6/10. This is not a so violent or graphic movie, and i'ts content is accessible to almost everyone despite the tragic background of the events. Profanity: 2/10. Just a little ugly words. Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: 6/10. Got this rating because the bad guys use a toxin that acts to hallucinate people. Can be a little intense. Frightening/Intense Scenes: 7/10. This is the most accessible Batman movie of the trilogy. It's dark, depressing at times and with a sad background, but nothing that went out of control for the audience. Total: 22/50. For most of the young/mature audiences.This is a great movie. The beginning of something even bigger. Just go and see it!",10,0,1,19 November 2013
The Dark Knight," Surprising, Exciting, Adicctive, Masterful, Shocking, Moving, Timeless Movie
","With more than 3,000 reviews there isn't much to say about this masterpiece. But it deserves many more reviews. This is a film of a lifetime. Seriously. It crosses all the lines of its genre in order to give all of us a showcase of every name involved. Not only Christian Bale or Health Ledger are unforgettable. Everything in this movie (camera, script, performances, story, action, direction) is at the highest and beyond. It's a movie made with style and groundbreaking aces on the hood.It could be shocking that this movie is so considered in all film lists across the world. But be prepared to be moved and surprised. At present day the filmmakers can still deliver masterpieces to audiences than can destabilized the ancient classics. This is a new classic. And it even deserves the #5 spot for me.My own parents guide: Sex & Nudity: 1/10. Very poor content of this, and just passionate kisses. Violence & Gore: 8/10. This is not a so violent or graphic movie, but when it comes it's really intense and sometimes upsetting (the 'jump scene' with the false Batman, Two Face looking, most of Joker attacks against people which includes plant an explosive inside a man stomach, kill one man with the infamous 'magic trick' scene...). Profanity: 5/10. Some language, but not so remarkable. Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: 3/10. Very poor content again. Nothing too much relevant. Frightening/Intense Scenes: 10/10. It's not about frightening except for the jump scene, but it does about intensity. The whole movie is brilliantly dark and extremely real, with people and situations really hard and truly moving at times. This is the most intense Batman movie. Even more intense and violent than the next one: Rises. Total: 27/50. Despite this can be a so low mark of explicit content in a so convoluted movie like this one, it's a really NOT FOR KIDS movie, and one of the most intense superhero movies ever. And the most disturbing in Batman trilogy.",10,0,1,16 November 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise meets his Groundhog Day with a surprising, well told story and energetic entertainment
","Edge of Tomorrow (EOT for me) will be the most surprising blockbuster of this year (maybe along with X-Men: Days of Future Past) for doing its job so well that beats every expectation about what it has to offer. A storyline about one man that is shown to us doing the 'same' things every time could be dull. But EOT has a thoughtful script full of turns and fun that entertains and allows to Cruise to do new things inside that particular Groundhog Day.I wont spoil anything because the movie is full of valuable twists, surprisingly good chemistry between Cruise and Emily Blunt (Full Metal B**ch) and it has an involving script aside of the spectacular action sequences. The first one in the movie is totally amazing. But the rest is as that good. The movie clearly develops in the action and the riveting pace. It offers what a great blockbuster should be and it reaches that superb goal.Also Tom Cruise gives his best performance in so many time. Maybe, I'm not joking, this is his best performance ever. For the first time he is not doing an smiling hero. He is a coward. He is a scared and inexperienced soldier who has to learn to be more skillful (and to escape from his personal loop) every time he returns to the 'same' day. And Cruise is wonderful in that role. You really don't recognize him. Forget his frequent smiling, his heroic or possible macho topics. This could be a new and groundbreaking role inside his career even if you are not a big fan of him (I'm not going as far as saying that this is his best movie or the most enjoyable one of all, but this movie could be one of his best ones too). And when a movie has a star doing his job properly and much better than expected, a great script and a riveting pace (the movie is never boring) the whole concept has the job done. And that's the case of EOT. Also the stellar performances from Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson are truly good.In fact I'm glad that this one came after 'Oblivion'. That one was good, but this one is different and much better. Don't expect 'Oblivion 2' or its same style because you will be wrong.Please, trust me and go to the theater to enjoy this wonderful, original and surprising entertainment. It delivers much more than you could expect, delivers the best Cruise (in so many time that I personally think that this is Cruise at his best) and delivers a clever story with a good twist. Enjoy!",9,333,430,28 May 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A Truly Phenomenal Ultimate Ending
","Despite the too many comparisons made by the everlasting shadow of its perfect predecessor, TDKR succeeds widely in its target: to be a fitting and most perfect as it possible be in order to conclude one of the greatest trilogies ever made. Seriously. Not only the nice ending of the film is one of the best things of it, all the movie delivers to the viewers everything that they (and I) probably were expected in a very unexpected way and Nolan makes another perfect movie that will make another impressive score on every movie site. Because that is what must be done. Christian Bale, Tom Hardy, Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anne Hathaway are truly perfect and the script is truly golden. Don't await too much to see this fantastic conclusion. 10/10.My own parents guide: Sex & Nudity: 2/10. Finally a sex scene that is cut off screen but is notably implied. But nothing graphic or visible. Violence & Gore: 7/10. I was expecting a darker and more explicit content in this sequel. But despite there is a lot of destruction, there is no that kind of visceral violence. It falls short of that. Profanity: 5/10. In the line of its predecessor. Nothing very remarkable. Alcohol/Drugs/Smoking: 2/10. Just for Bane's mask, which clams his pain although this is not fully explained in the movie. Frightening/Intense Scenes: 10/10. Not frightening, but very intense and so dark movie. It's not the most intense Batman movie, but almost beats TDK. It is the darkest vision of the three and relies on powerful images and score, adding tension and emotion. Total: 26/50. A moderated mark but NOT FOR KIDS again. It's not explicit, but it's very powerful and intense.",9,2,8,20 July 2012
Godzilla," After thinking about it, I must replace my own past words...
","I said once i went out the theater:Godzilla finally found the perfect movie for itself yet. The story works as well the pace and the special effects. The first half of the movie is absolutely perfect with all the destruction that the monster provokes. It leaves to the viewer unforgettable scenes. But the second half is not at all a disappointment. The action sequences are effective and spectacular. Godzilla is truly frightening. Young viewers are advised! The acting is also so nice delivering solid performances and helping the drama. Bryan Cranston may be a standout but Elisabeth Olsen is a scene stealer and a very important role here. With any doubts I had an encounter with one of the best movies of the year.But now, after some days I say:This is a riveting entertaining that will please the moviegoers. But it's s disappointment in terms of the monster itself and its fights against the other. An important lack.",6,85,174,12 May 2014
Spectre," Craig's Best Bond Movie
","Just came out of the theater and I'm literally blowing away! As a moviegoer and movie lover looking for a good entertaining is simply irresistible not to like this movie even just a little. But if your genre is the action or you are a Bond fan-boy (but a real fan-boy, the one who knows that Bond is a dark killer with a great sense f humor as well a troubled human being and not just a fantasy and silly spy in silly missions with a handful of gadgets) then SPECTRE will be a total feast for you.Sam Mendes and Daniel Craig give us another triumph after the polemic 'Skyfall' and this time both have managed to get a perfect balance between that intimate psychology from the previous outing and the nostalgia from a classic Bond movie (with quality, not just passable) that hadn't had hit the theater in a very while. By that way we found ourselves in a very Bond centric movie (perhaps the only one in the whole franchise in which Craig is the absolute protagonist without being overshadowed even by the handsome villain) that explores and expands the character beyond the limits from the last third of Skyfall and a truly genuine adventure full of suspense and crazy twists to maintain the attention.Across many places (Rome, Tangiers, Austria and coming back to London for a classic suspenseful climax) we found Bond getting started in a personal mission out from the MI6 (although later he will enlist some of his confidence partners with him) that drives him from a enigmatic widow (Monica Bellucci steals the scene alongside Craig) to a beautiful and looking innocent Madeleine Swann (Léa Seydoux) until coming face to face to Franz Oberhauser (Christoph Waltz doing himself stills being fitted for the role and gives chills in his scenes with Craig).The story is bigger than Skyfall, Quantum and Casino Royale all together. And that's funny because this movie is really connected to all of them (another thing that makes me love Daniel Craig's Bond era). And marrying the credible word (political games, drones included) with the preposterous touch of any of the classic movies of Bond (Oberhauser, his hidden base, his plan) as well giving the Bond past a lot more of light and an effective closure by the end makes SPECTRE to succeed over any negative expectation and to give the audience the most entertaining outing coming from Craig and probably his best Bond yet (anyone knows if he's returning for another one even at another studio?). It's clearly a movie for those of you who are truly fans of Craig's unique run, but for all the haters too (because that lack of Bondish elements are there and most notably than ever).The humor is back (a drunken conversation with a rat makes the funniest and most hilarious moment) even at times that you couldn't imagine (the torture scene is intense, much better than the classic one in Casino Royale, but handed with dark laughs at some parts). The action is crazy and shot with class (the one shot that opens the movie is the most beautifully complex the franchise has given us so far) and the script goes along the way without going down at any moment or being lazy. It tries hard to touch a lot of plots into a big one to the final part of the film and that implies to focus on some parts more than others. But all the movie wants to be seen and experienced is explored and is a hell of a ride.SPECTRE is the most enjoyable Daniel Craig Bond film (and probably his farewell-with-a-bang), and the best Bond movie in recent memory. I did not exactly know what to expect for this installment after being put to sleep after the breathtaking Skyfall (so all the hype surrounding it) but not such a bold movie like this. If he (Craig) really leaves after this one, he will achieve something that Connery, Moore & Brosnan failed to do: say goodbye to the character on a stunning high. My personal ranking of Daniel Craig as James Bond: SPECTRE (1º) / Skyfall - Casino Royale (2º, both deserve it) / Quantum of Solace (3º).",10,107,214,26 October 2015
