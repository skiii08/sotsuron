Requiem for a Dream," As bleak as it gets
","I do like to watch a good depressing film and I'd wanted to watch this ever since it topped a list of the most depressing films ever. I wasn't disappointed. This film left a deep impression on me and is indeed the most depressing film I've seen. The story follows four people as their addiction to drugs grows. As well as the usual young persons drug abuse it also features an elderly woman who is addicted to weight loss pills. The film portrays all the drug users sympathetically and treats them as decent people who just happen to have a terrible addiction which makes the results even more sad. The spiral into darkness starts slowly as you get to know the characters but once it starts it really does spiral fast leading to an unforgettably bleak final reel. This film thankfully in no way glamourizes drugs but shows graphically how they can take an iron grip on anyone. The acting is of the highest order from all involved but especially from Ellen Burstyn and Jennifer Connolly who are tremendous. This is an excellent and must see film with a brilliant script, great acting and an ending that will live with you.",10,1,2,20 May 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," A film full of suspense and surprises.
","A woman finds herself in a bunker after a car crash but how did she get there and why is she there?. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a fairly slow moving film pretty much set in one place. It relies heavily on keeping the audience guessing as to what is really happening. On this score it works pretty well with plenty of red herrings thrown in along the way as the paranoia of the situation kicks in. The fact that there are spells when not much happens makes the things that do happen more sinister.John Goodman is fantastic as the owner of the bunker whilst Mary Elizabeth Winstead is captivating as the woman trying to piece together what is real and what isn't. John Gallagher Jr has a lesser job as the every man but still convinces. This is a film that pays to stick with as it ratchets up the tension tenfold as it nears it's climax. There is a sudden switch of pace towards the end which is a brave thing of the film makers to try. I found the ending a bit of a disappointment but I still found this an interesting mix of genres and always entertaining. I was so confused as to whether I liked this film much on first watch, that I re-watched it the following day, something I rarely do. This confirmed to me that it is a good film despite a few things I didn't like. Personally I'd rate it slightly higher than Cloverfield as it's just a more interesting film.",9,0,0,9 January 2017
Lone Survivor," Not without flaws but still a brilliantly intense war film
","The true story of a small group of Navy Seals on a mission to kill a Taliban leader that goes wrong. They are left to fend for themselves in a hostile environment against massive odds. It's a brutal, relentless but exhilarating tale which is brilliantly filmed from start to finish. It does have a few flaws, the Americans seem able to withstand many shots and rock collisions whilst the Taliban go down with every shot. Even given the fact the Americans are highly trained and skilled whilst the Taliban presumably are not, this does grate a little. However the action scenes are so intense and incredibly well done that I am able to forgive this. The acting is superb and realistic from the whole cast especially Mark Wahlberg and Ali Suliman. It is nice to see a war film with a different angle, one that shows that war isn't always black and white and things aren't always what you believe them to be. Lone Survivor for me is one of the best modern war films combining a great story, great action scenes and great drama. An absolute treat to watch. Highly recommended.",8,1,2,20 January 2015
Dawn of the Dead," Brilliant Zombie horror
","Dawn of the Dead is one of the best Zombie films ever made. It combines a decent storyline, good acting, nice cinematography, good dialogue, good soundtrack and is genuinely scary. From it's brilliant realised and scary opening, Dawn of the Dead holds you by the throat and doesn't let go. The action is pretty much non stop and at times it becomes unbearably tense. As well as a huge amount of gory scenes to keep bloodhounds satisfied it throws in a number of human interest sub plots as the survivors come to terms with their predicament. This stops this being just another one dimensional gore-fest. What elevates it above most of is that it has characters are not only interesting but totally believable. All the cast do a good job in particular Michael Kelly as the power crazy CJ and Sarah Polley, Jake Webber and Ving Rhames as the main survivors. This is an incredibly entertaining film packed full of memorable scenes. Most films are let down by their ending but this one is highly satisfactory if a little bleak. Anyone that likes Zombie movies is almost certain to like it. In my opinion it is pretty much the perfect Zombie movie. Highly recommended.",10,23,27,30 August 2014
World War Z," Fast paced and entertaining zombie movie
","This is a big budget zombie movie that covers the immediate aftermath of a zombie outbreak. As the rating would suggest it is not your typical gory zombie romp but it makes up for this with fast paced action and a fair bit of tension. There are always going to be critics of this film, as the lack of brutal horror and gore will put some people off. I understand this but there is room in the market for a different take on the usual themes and this provides it. In keeping with modern Zombie films the zombies themselves are fast, very fast and seem to have more intelligence than normal. This leads to a number of tense and impressive long range visual scenes. The acting is solid and the story fast paced if a little far fetched. However if you are going to pick holes in Zombie film then you really are watching the wrong genre. Brad Pitt is a good actor and he does a good job of injecting some charisma into his role. I must admit I do prefer more brutal zombie films like Dawn of the Dead and 28 weeks later but I found this an entertaining film with plenty to recommend it. Worth watching especially if you find yourself in the older age bracket.",9,2,3,26 May 2014
The Hunger Games," Much much better than I thought it would be.
","I am 40 and have never heard of the book and not being a massive fan of Jennifer Lawrence had little desire to see the film. The premise seems quite similar to Battle Royale, a film I enjoyed a lot so on a whim I decided to see what it was like. I was aware that this was only a 12A so would be a watered down version but I prefer to make my own mind up about a film not blindly knock a film because it's seen as 'uncool' or not specifically aimed at my age or gender bracket. The film boasts an excellent cast and Jennifer Lawrence is slowly winning me around. She was perfect for this role. Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley also put in good performances. The Hunger Games grabbed me early on and the set up explained the set up well which made it a lot easier to follow what was going on. People have complained at the slow build up but I found it to be necessary in this instance. In any case although it may have lacked action for me it was never boring. The film has a fair amount of tension and whilst the deaths are understandably not gory it doesn't hinder the film too much. If you're looking for gore then stay away from 12A films. This is a story led film and it tells it's a story told very well. This is an impressive film, forget what the self appointed trendies say. It's easy to sit behind a computer and criticize to make yourself feel more important. There really isn't anything bad you can say about this film. It's targeted at a certain audience who judging by the films success were more than happy with the end result and ultimately that's what counts. The Hunger Games took me by surprise at how enjoyable and well made it is. It isn't as good as Battle Royale but it's aiming at a different audience. If you watch it with an open mind you may enjoy it as much as I did.",8,0,5,4 August 2013
The Impossible," Pretty disappointing
",I was looking forward to watching this film but unfortunately was left underwhelmed. It starts of very well and the cast is pretty strong apart from Ewan Macgregor who just sleepwalks his way through the film. I am a big fan of Naomi Watts and she does an excellent job in this good in this as does the lad who plays her eldest child. After a bright start and some decent CGI of the tidal wave the film loses steam very rapidly. The storyline is flimsy and I just didn't care enough for any of the supporting characters. It drags on and on with just the odd scene managing to elicit some interest. Personally I'd have rather they had concentrated on the build up to the Tsunami rather than focus more on the aftermath.It's not a bad film just a film that could have been so much more than it turned out to be. I can't say i'll be rushing to re-watch it anytime soon.,4,0,3,18 November 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Brilliant
","A truly brilliant horror-comedy which gets it right on every level. Both funny, touching and with plenty of horror moments, this film has it all.The film boasts an excellent British cast with stand-out performances from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as the main protagonists and Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy as Shauns mom and step dad.The film boasts several memorable scenes but in truth barely a scene is wasted. The true test of a film is whether it repays repeated viewings and on this point the film really excels. I have seen this film on a number of occasions and pick up something new each time.The film is very British and the extreme bad language throughout may put some people off and the ending could have been slightly stronger but other than that, I really cannot fault this film.Highly recommended.",10,0,2,14 November 2012
Argo," Very dreary rescue story
",I was expecting to like this Oscar winning film but sadly felt more than a little disappointed by it. It started well enough with some tense scenes as the US embassy was stormed. However it quickly went downhill after that and turned into a bit of a bore. I usually like Ben Affleck but I wasn't convinced by him in this at all. The rest of the cast are merely adequate. I wish they had concentrated on the hostages in the embassy rather than the 6 holed up in the Canadian embassy. There are a few tense scenes nearing the end however these are nowhere near enough and I just didn't find the story riveting at all. As on Oscar winner I expected much much more than this mundane film. This goes down in my book as the worst Best Film winner in recent memory.,5,1,2,7 July 2014
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Very funny
","This is the funniest film I have seen in a long time. It's a strange film in a way as it's billed as a Rom-Com but is far edgier and much funnier than that. I am not a particularly big fan of Steve Carrel but here he excels as a man left bewildered when his wife admits to an affair. What follows is slightly surreal as he is taken under his wing by the charming Rylan Gosling and taught about how to woo women. The results are hilarious as both men change the way they think over the course of the following months. An excellent cast featuring great performances from Gosling, Julianne Moore and the impressive Emma Stone make the very funny script come to life. This is a Rom-Com that no guy can be ashamed of watching and liking and the best of it's kind since Four Weddings and a Funeral.",9,1,2,18 November 2012
The Rocker," A great cast make this a silly but very entertaining comedy
","On paper this doesn't look promising. Failed aging rocker gets second chance via his his school nephew. All sounds a tad lame however despite this, The Rocker ends up being entertaining and at times funny. A lot of the charm of the film is down to one man. Rainn Wilson ( he of The Office fame). There is something about Wilson that just makes you watch. It's not even that he plays likable characters but there is something about him that is fascinating. Put say Jack Black in this role and I'm pretty sure the results would be far less desirable. Add in the gorgeous and very talented Emma Stone and really there isn't a lot to hate about this film. Yes in parts it's fairly predictable but it's always enjoyable as the downtrodden Wilson finally gets his shot at the big time. If you are in the mood for some silly but entertaining fun then this is the film for you.",7,2,2,14 March 2015
Billy Elliot," Excellent
","A story about a boy ballet dancer sounds about as appealing as a 25 year stretch in prison. However it didn't take long for this film to win me round. Jamie Bell is simply outstanding as the would be boy ballet dancer ( and has proved this performance was no fluke with later film efforts). Julie Walters as his teacher is also excellent as are the rest of the talented British cast. The plot is pretty straight forward and you always know what is coming next but this film is always entertaining with some wonderfully blunt and funny scenes. As with any good film this film is just as entertaining the second, third and fourth time you watch it as the first.It may take a bit of a stereotypical view of Northern British men and Northern life in general but it is a film and I didn't find this was detrimental to the film. This is a wonderful feel good drama that can be watched by all ages even children way below the ridiculous 15 rating.",9,0,0,12 March 2013
Brokeback Mountain," Outstanding
","I remember watching this for the first time and disliking it. For some reason (thankfully) a few years later I re-watched it and felt completely the opposite. Quite why I didn't like it first time i'm not sure, but it has since become one of my favourite films. It's a simple story of the forbidden love between two men in the tough American West. It's a brave film as on the surface a film about gay cowboys is not going to be everyone's first choice of viewing. However thankfully just like life nothing is ever clear cut. Even after watching it's not really clear ( to me anyway) if both men are even gay or just have an attraction to just each other.The only way this film could succeed was by a good script and great performances and what it got was a great script and superlative performances. I have rarely if ever seen such a towering but understated performance as that of Heath Ledger in this. How he did not pick up an Oscar for this i'm not sure. He is backed by a very strong young cast. Jake Gyllenhaal has the lesser role but is almost as impressive as Heath Ledger and the two supporting female leads Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are excellent. I would suggest that this is the career high for all concerned ( apart maybe from Jake Gyllenhaal who was superb in Zodiac). The cinematography is incredible and you get a real sense of the vastness of the American wilderness. The plot meanders at it's own pace but you are so spellbound at what you are watching it never drags. Much has been made of the infamous sex scene but whilst as a straight man I can't say I wasn't uncomfortable watching it, it is necessary and it is handled very well. This is without doubt a classic movie and one of the best movies of all time in my opinion. It's a shame it hasn't got a higher rating than 7.7 on here as it easily deserves a Top 250 place but sadly I guess the films content stops it achieving it's rightful place.",10,5,5,18 May 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," Hugely entertaining
","The Day After Tomorrow is a visually impressive film and if you forgive the somewhat hokey plot is extremely entertaining. To really enjoy the film you do have to suspend belief as there are a number of highly unrealistic scenes. This film isn't about accurately portraying global warming themes, it's a disaster movie and it's about pure entertainment and on that basis this film scores highly. There are a number of memorable scenes which gives this a high re-watch value. The destruction scenes in particular are hugely impressive.Dennis Quaid makes a charismatic lead and there is good support from a strong cast including a nice cameo from Ian Holm. In my opinion this is one of the best disaster films ever made and nothing less than entertaining from start to finish.",9,1,2,19 July 2014
Hotel Rwanda," Heartbreaking
","I must admit to shamefully sharing most of the western worlds apathy to events in Africa and knew very little if anything about the Rwandan genocide. This film covers a small part of the atrocities that went on in Rwanda and is a real eye opener. It follows a Hutu man Paul who is the manager of a hotel who houses thousands of Tutsi's to try and save them from being killed by the Hutu militia. This is a gut wrenching, tense and shocking film that conveys the terror of the Tutsi people left to brutally die and whose fate rested with one ordinary man. Don Cheadle is magnificent as the hotel manager Paul, in fact it's one of the best performances i've ever seen in a film. There is fine support from Sophie Okonedo and Nick Nolte. Some scenes are quite distressing and it would take a hard heart not to get choked up at some of the scenes. This is a truly brilliant film and a must watch. If you did enjoy this film then also try and watch 'Shooting Dogs' another film that covers this subject brilliantly.",9,0,0,10 August 2013
Once," Very simple, very original, very very good
","I remember watching this for the first time and thinking i'm not going to like this. A minute in I was hooked and the film just flew by. I have watched the film again 4 times over a period of time and have enjoyed it just as much each time, the test of a truly great film.There is a lovely atmosphere throughout the film and the soundtrack is great. What really elevates the film is the thoroughly natural and convincing performances by the leads Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova. There is an obvious chemistry between the two and it's no surprise they became a real life couple despite the age difference.It's hard to pigeon hole this film as it's like no other I have seen. It is part musical ( but in no way cheesy) and part romance (but in no way corny) and it is quite hard to actually pinpoint exactly why it is so good and so enjoyable.There is barely a false moment throughout the movie and the ending is just about perfect missing every cliché trap in the book. A resounding success and one of the best films I have ever seen.For a small film this is a truly remarkable effort",10,1,2,22 April 2013
The Adventures of Tintin," Much better than I imagined
",I am not a fan of Tin Tin and was therefore not particularly looking forward to watching this. Thankfully it turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. The animation is simply stunning and the set pieces are breathtaking. There are plenty of genuinely funny moments throughout the film to go with the numerous action sequences. It is also surprisingly violent for a PG rated film. The plot is pretty far fetched but to be honest when a film looks this good it doesn't really matter. I watched this with my two young sons and they enjoyed it even more than me. A film that can be enjoyed by all ages and another triumph for Steven Spielberg.,8,1,2,2 January 2013
Rocky II," Excellent sequel
","It is pretty rare for a sequel to be as good or as near as damn it to the original but this is a good example. The same excellent cast remain and it's basically more of the same as Rocky has a re-match with Apollo Creed who finds it hard to take that Rocky lasted the full distance with him last time. Although the drama is notched back a little this is still a very engrossing film culminating in a brilliant fight. Sure it's about as believable as Father Christmas, as most of the punches landed would knock out most fighters but this is about pure entertainment and the final scenes provide this in spades. If you liked the first Rocky then there is no reason not to like this one just as much.",9,0,0,5 April 2015
Warrior," Rocky for the 2000's. Excellent.
",This is an intelligent and must watch sports drama. It is very much along the lines of Rocky but with a better script in my opinion. Two estranged brothers are fighting for the title of ultimate spartan amidst the pain of a family feud. The film concentrates on their preparation and reasons for fighting whilst interweaving their family estrangement.It could have been a corny film but instead this is an excellently directed and acted drama that can be enjoyed by everyone. The acting is extremely good from all participants though I was particularly taken with the performances of Nick Nolte (not an actor I was previously fond of) and Tom Hardy as the younger brother. Both were excellent in this though good support was in rich supply with Joel Edgerton as the elder more sensible brother and Frank Grillo as his trainer also doing great jobs. This is a crowd pleasing film and you could pick holes in it but it's so well done and so enjoyable that only the churlish would complain. For me this is one of the finest of all sports drama's combining an intelligent script with great and believable action. This film is highly recommended for all ages. A true modern classic.,10,2,4,27 May 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Unbearably dull
","I was expecting to like this film sadly my hopes were dashed pretty early on. The film started badly and just kept on going down and down. This is without doubt one of the most tedious films I have ever seen and I can only congratulate myself on sitting through the whole two hours. I am struggling to see what this film was trying to be. Drama? Nope there wasn't any. Comedy? Nope not a chuckle to be had. Romance? I suppose you could make a half hearted argument for that one but watching two unlikeable characters fall in love is hardly romantic. This film was just two hours of inane and boring dialogue. The acting was weak, I find it incredible that the charmless, expressionless and limited Jennifer Lawrence actually won an Oscar for this. Surely one of the biggest travesties in Oscar history. Bradley Cooper was just plain annoying and even Robert De Niro could do nothing to save this turkey although he is by some distance the best thing about this film. There really is not one aspect of this film I enjoyed and it's rare I can say that about any film. Unbelievably bad.",4,16,31,17 April 2013
Rocky IV," Still fun but the worst of the first four
","Rocky 4 has Rocky fighting his most powerful opponent yet the Russian hulk Ivan Drago. Drago has killed Apollo Creed in an exhibition match and Rocky wants revenge. Unfortunately whilst the plot is OK, unfortunately it swaps any drama for too many video montages. The generic American rock soundtrack is dreadful and adds nothing to the film. Along with this there are some pretty terrible stereotypes and some crass scenes.For all it's flaws this still manages to entertain and the bottom line is this is it's purpose. The fight scenes are as brutal as ever and the Drago V Creed fight is really well done. For Rocky fans this is still a good nights entertainment.",7,2,5,5 April 2015
The Intouchables," Outstanding must watch comedy-drama.
","A quadriplegic hires an ex con to be his carer and an unlikely friendship ensues. Doesn't sound too promising but this film hits heights you really don't expect. This is a rare film that hits the spot on both the drama and the comedy front with ease. Rarely have a laughed so much and add onto the top notch drama and you really have hit the jackpot. Central to the films success are the two leads Francois Cluzet ( looking remarkably like Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Sy. Both are likable and bring real depth to their roles making you root for both of them. The supporting cast are excellent and there isn't a false performance throughout. The films pacing is excellent and although it was nearly 2 hours long you really just want it to continue. A lot of films are let down by the ending but this one really delivers on the emotional front. There is nothing that lets this film down, it's that good. I never rate films 10 on first watch but I'm making an exception with this one. One of the best films I've ever seen.",10,0,2,29 October 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Excellent Superhero film.
",I am not a fan of super hero movies and watched this only because my kids wanted to watch it. The cast was top rate. I thought Andrew Garfield was pretty impressive as Peter Parker and made a better Spider-man than Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone is a fantastic actress and always worth watching and adds charm as Gwen Stacy. Martin Sheen was as good as ever and Rhys Ifans makes for a pretty good villain. The film was beautifully shot and the set pieces where Peter Parker discovers his powers were amusing and well filmed. The action sequences throughout the film were exciting and well executed.This is an old fashioned and uncomplicated telling of the tale and much the better for it. This to my mind is the finest Superhero film made and certainly much better than the recent Dark Knight films.,8,9,18,31 March 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Incredibly detailed, beautifully filmed masterpiece.
","I've always had an interest in the Old West from a young child and this is the story of the build up to and death of the infamous Jesse James and also the story behind his killer Robert Ford. It isn't a film for those who want action but for those who are interested in the background and aftermath of his death this is just about as good as it gets. The casting is excellent, Brad Pitt is an excellent actor and it's obvious he has a strong affection for Jesse James. His is an understated and brilliant performance backed up by an equally impressive performance by Casey Affleck as Robert Ford who idolises Jesse James but eventually turns into his killer. A strong supporting cast which includes Sam Rockwell means you are never going to be disappointed with the acting. The cinematography is outstanding and the best I've seen in any film. It's almost like watching a photograph come to life at times. In addition the narration of the film is a good idea, excellently done. This is a film that strongly led by the characters and dialogue and therefore won't appeal to everyone especially as it's also a bum numbing 2 hours 40 minutes. However for those with an appreciation of the subject and fine acting this is a real treat. I have seen this film three times now and have enjoyed it more each time i've seen it. This was obviously a labour of love to the director Andrew Dominik and to Brad Pitt and it shows. To me this is the finest western ever made and one of the best films ever made.",10,0,0,22 June 2013
Twilight," Nowhere near as bad as the rating suggests
","I had never had any inclination to watch this film, however it was on TV and with nothing else to do I thought i'd give it a go. I wasn't expecting to like it but found myself getting involved in the story. The acting was so so but there was a certain chemistry between Pattinson and the beautiful Kristin Stewart. It is clearly aimed at the girl market but what's so wrong about that. I see that it has a poor IMDb rating but this is based purely on blokes voting it a 1 without seeing it, a clear case of voting snobbery. The film was entertaining throughout and well worth a view, as long as you are prepared to suspend belief and enjoy something for what it is rather than how cool you think it is to dislike it. I for one will be watching the sequels.",7,2,5,21 August 2011
Zulu," Outstanding
","Zulu is in my opinion the best war film ever. A small contingent of British soldiers hold out against a massive Zulu army in 1879. It's a true story and pretty accurate though understandably some liberties were almost certainly taken by the film makers. I have rarely seen another film that doesn't waste a single scene. The pacing is perfect, the battle scenes although not as bloody as modern day epics are well done and it entertains from start to perfect finish. There are so many memorable scenes and characters that this is one film that really does repay repeated viewings. For me though what really elevates this film above most others is the acting. Rarely can any film have encouraged such strong performances from every member of the cast even down to the smallest part. Stanley Baldwin is great, Michael Caine puts in a career best performance, William Booth is charismatic as the wayward Hook but for me the highlight is Nigel Green as Colour Sergeant Bourne the embodiment of an British soldier. Zulu is a triumph of film making from start to finish and I am amazed that such a good film doesn't earn a higher rating than 7.8 on here. My children both under 10 have just watched it and loved it, for a film that is 50 years old that it great testament to it's class and staying power. Simply one of the best films of all time.",10,4,5,29 August 2014
Seabiscuit," A brilliant story, brilliantly told.
","I love a good true story and having read the book 'Seabiscuit' I looked forward to watching this. It didn't disappoint. Set in the American depression it follows a no-hope small horse with knobbly knee's and a very poor record who slowly and incredibly becomes a champion and with it a national hero. This is an extremely well told story and the race scenes are truly magnificent and believable and it's hard to see how they could have been bettered. This is at times an incredibly sad story and at other times uplifting. In fact even though I have now seen it three times I found it more heartbreaking the third time than the first maybe because I am older and now have children. It is one of the rare films, for me anyway, that improves every time you watch it. So much so in fact that I have been compelled to recently upgrade it's score to a 10. The acting is solid rather than spectacular though I thought Chris Cooper did a brilliant job as the trainer Tom Smith and Jeff Bridges is also very good as the owner of Seabiscuit. This is a film that's all about the story and what a great story it is. In the wrong hands this could however have turned into a sentimental bit of schmaltz but thankfully this is a pitfall that director Gary Ross avoids. For a long film it rarely drags and every scene seems necessary.Seabiscuit is a must watch film and one of the finest sporting films ever put to celluloid. An unbridled (forgive the pun) success.",10,1,3,26 May 2013
2012," Disappointing disaster movie
","As a lover of disaster movies, this was a big let down. The special effects were excellent but the back stories and dialogue were disappointing to say the least. John Cusack is a very good actor but was totally wasted in this.Most major disaster movies demand you to suspend belief a bit but this film took that to the extreme. Some of the films set pieces were so improbable as to be laughable.Compared to higher quality disaster movies like Deep Impact and The Day After Tomorrow this comes across as laughably amateur. The ending like most films of its type is predictable and dull.On the upside the scenes of destruction are well done and entertaining.Overall I expected a lot more but there is enough entertainment (just) to merit further viewings.",7,2,2,6 November 2011
Schindler's List," Brilliant
","This is simply one of the best films ever made. It is heartbreaking, depressing and uplifting in equal measure. The story itself is simple but beautifully realised and the acting is incredible. Liam Neeson, Ralf Fiennes and Ben Kingsley are all magnificent but there is not a duff performance throughout this film. This is a long film but it never gets boring and there are memorable scenes throughout. I am not a big fan of Steven Spielberg but it is difficult to see how this film could have been bettered by any director. This film stands as a brutal reminder of the horrors of war but also the incredible bravery and compassion of a few men.",10,15,23,30 December 2012
Kick-Ass," Fresh, innovative and brilliant
","Not being a super-hero fan when I first watched this film I wasn't expecting much despite the positive reviews. Any doubts I had were quickly expelled. Right from the off this film hooks you in with an unbelievable mixture of comedy, action and violence. This film has a very good cast and there isn't a duff character or performance throughout the film from the leads right down to the minor characters. It's an almost insanely violent film but it's all done in such a comedic comic book style that you almost forget you really shouldn't be enjoying it. I have watched this film quite a few times now and it bears up well to repeated viewings which to me is a sign of a great film. This is an ambitious and brave film which could have been a dud but instead ends up an undeniable triumph. Simply one of the best films you could ever wish to see.",10,0,3,22 February 2013
Casualties of War," Excellent and much underrated
","Casualties of War is a film I chanced upon whilst flicking channels one day. As a result I had no expectations as to what the film would offer. I remember being slightly surprised to see a young Michael J Fox playing a soldier and I think it was this point that kept me watching. Fox plays a good at heart man who finds out what war really entails and how it can affects different people in different ways, often for the worse. His young squad capture a local girl and things turn ugly. It is at times brutal but always compelling. It features a great young cast headed by Fox and an impressive Sean Penn. I am surprised that this currently has a rating of just 7.0 as for me it is one of the better war films of recent decades. It is always engrossing and has the guts to tackle difficult subject matters in a no holds barred way. A very memorable film and one of my favourite war films.",10,7,9,23 February 2015
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Very moving and well acted drama
","I recently watched this film again, I enjoyed it the first time but wanted to see if it stood up to a repeat viewing. This is a film that see's the second world war mainly through the eyes of an eight year old boy Bruno ( well played by Asa Butterfield) and his relationship with a young prisoner of war ( brilliantly played by Jack Scanlon)at a concentration camp. I'm not sure if the film realistically portrays life in a concentration camp and to be honest I don't care, this is not the point of the movie. There are plenty of scenes that hammer home the brainwashing that occurred of the German people and the futility of the war. The acting from the adults is very good, especially from Vera Farmiga who puts in a great performance as the mother who learns just what the war really entails. Excellent support is provided by David Thewlis and Rupert Friend.This is a very moving but depressing film but excellent all the same. I actually enjoyed it more the second time around and my two young children also enjoyed it. Highly recommended.",8,1,1,12 May 2013
Jurassic World," Visually great but loses its way
","Jurassic World is not on a par with the original and I really don't see what the need was for a reboot, especially one with nothing new to add. It does entertain at times as long as you shut down your brain for a while and I guess that's how these films are meant to be viewed. Just plain old entertainment. It looks visually great with great landscapes and realistic dinosaurs, unfortunately the plot is weak and the script whilst having a few snappy one liners falls a bit flat. Chris Pratt does a good job as the lead but Bryce Dallas Howard's character is a disaster. I spent much of the second half of the film praying she'd be eaten. Sadly that would require a more imaginative plot and we are instead left to suffer one of the poorest performances from a lead in quite a while. The rest of the cast are OK but nothing more than the usual stereotypes. For all it's flaws there are some great scenes especially in the first half and I was intermittently entertained. This will probably appeal more to younger audiences than older ones who have seen all this before. Jurassic World just about scrapes a 7 for me but I won't rush to watch it again for some time.",7,9,21,18 November 2015
Everest," A desperately dull dud
","A group of rich men go up a mountain and get caught in a bad storm. I found it hard to summon up any sympathy at all for any of the bland characters in this big budget bore fest. There are a lot of talented actors on show but none even get the chance to do anything remotely interesting. What a waste, it would surely have been far better to cast a bunch of unknowns, instead as the plot was so turgid I kept checking IMDb every time I spotted a familiar face, of which there are many. From a long way out you are left hoping for the finish but steel yourselves because it's quite a long film. There is some nice scenery but apart from that there is nothing of interest to be found here.This is a slow moving, unengaging, poorly scripted, poorly acted mess. Bearing in mind the budget it's one of the most disappointing films I've seen in a long time.",4,4,6,28 November 2016
Elysium," Visually great but ends up just a standard action film
",A promising opening quickly turns to disappointment as it becomes clear that Elysium is all show and no substance. I was hoping for more of a sci-fi story but this is just a glorified action movie which quickly turns pretty tedious. This is a shame as there was plenty of potential to explore. Elysium is wonderfully realised but there just isn't enough time spent here or learning anything of its inhabitants. Instead the bulk of the plot follows Matt Damon as he tries to get there. The story just isn't strong enough to hold your attention. Matt Damon is a good actor and he is fine in this as is Jodie Foster but they just aren't given a good enough script to make this the movie it should have been. Whilst it does have it's moments I found this a desperately disappointing film and it's not one I'd sit through again.,5,0,0,7 June 2014
Rocky," Still holds up well today.
",It's easy to dismiss Rocky as a film and not having seen it for years I had. Watching it again recently though has re-opened my eyes to just how good a film it is. Sylvester Stallone is great as the struggling bum boxer given an unexpected shot at the world heavyweight title. Rocky is much more than a straight boxing movie however and the burgeoning romance between Rocky and Adrian ( a wonderful performance from Talia Shore) is dealt with brilliantly. There is fine support from Burgess Meredith as Rocky's trainer and Burt Young as Adrians brother. The actual boxing bout is highly unbelievable yet I was that engrossed it didn't really matter. It all ends a little unexpectedly but this is another strength of the film. This is a film that can still be enjoyed by todays modern audience and this is a testimony to it's fine script. An undoubted classic.,9,0,0,5 April 2015
The Descent," Horror at it's best
","This is a modern day classic horror far superior to other perceived modern classics like Alien. This is a unique, tense, gory and actually scary movie that doesn't disappoint on any level. The acting is a cut above the normal horror movie. The characters are believable and it makes a nice change to see an all female cast. The claustrophobic set pieces are dealt with superbly and you almost feel you are down there with the girls. The monsters when they come are terrifying and remarkably believable. Once the action hots up it is almost unrelenting. There is plenty of gore to keep horror fans happy as well as a sharp well written script. The bleak UK ending has split opinion but for me it is a brave and fitting end to a superb film. This for me is an unqualified success and if you like horror you can't go wrong with this.",10,1,3,3 March 2013
Rocky III," Action packed and another excellent sequel
",Most franchises are showing signs of flagging by the 3rd film but the Rocky series defies this as Rocky 3 is another absorbing film. Rocky has made it to world champion and is enjoying the fruits of success. That is until Clubber Lang comes onto the scene ( an impressively aggressive Mr T ). This entry features more fights and a charity boxing v WWE match between Rocky and Hulk Hogan. It's an explosive mix and this film doesn't slow down for a minute. Not that it's all action as it does feature one of the saddest scenes in all the Rocky films. The final bout is suitably hard hitting and I loved the very final scene. For fans of the originals this is another treat and again this is another entry that holds up well today.,8,0,0,5 April 2015
Zombieland," Fun horror-comedy
","When I first saw Zombieland I was a little underwhelmed but this is a film that pays off with repeat viewings. Following a zombie holocaust a disparate small band of survivors trek across America.A superb cast bring the witty script to life. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect as the geeky hero but the acting honours go to Woody Harrelson as the slightly deranged Tallahasse, a man obsessed by Twinkies. Add in support from two of the best young actresses in Hollywood, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin and you really can't go wrong. There is even a nice cameo from Bill Murray. This is a fast and entertaining film which mixes laughs and gore to great effect. It's like an American Shaun of the Dead and if you liked that then you should find this worth watching. Highly recommended.",9,1,2,23 November 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," It's still so popular for a reason
",What can you say about this film that hasn't already been said? Modern audiences are in the main averse to watching black and white films. The fact it is still an incredibly popular film decades after it's release tells you all you need to know. It's a clever idea and it's great story that actually makes you think. The acting is superb and James Stewart is at his brilliant best. There are sad and uplifting moments in equal measure and an ending that leaves you thinking whether you should laugh or cry. If you are feeling a bit down then just put this film on and I guarantee it will make you feel better. Quite simply this is one of the best films ever made and only the most cynical misery will fail to be touched by it.,10,4,8,10 June 2014
Glory Road," Uplifting sports drama
",Basketball is not a big sport in the UK and I find it slightly bemusing that college sport appears to have such a high profile in America. However my lack of understanding of college basketball and it's history did not impair my enjoyment of this film. Josh Lucas (excellent as always) plays the college basketball coach who leads his team to unexpected success. The acting throughout the film is top class. The on court action is done extremely well and you do get a real taste of what an achievement it was. The racial storyline is a well trodden one but I never got the sense that this was patronising and that the black players were saints with the white guys the caricature bad guys. This is one of the better sports dramas I have seen with plenty of lump in the throat moments and a finish that is highly satisfying. Recommended.,7,0,0,31 March 2013
The Blind Side," Enjoyable true story
","I had originally swerved this on release but as a recent convert to American Football I decided maybe now was the time to watch it. To be honest you don't need to be a fan of NFL to like this film as it features little sporting action. Instead concentrates on the relationship between a troubled young man and a family that takes him in. It is pretty slow moving at times but despite this, it always held my interest. The acting is spot on by all concerned with Sandra Bullock excellent as the feisty mom. The plot is fairly predictable however the performances are so natural that this film really does leave you with a warm glow. Maybe at times it could have been a little grittier but as a heartwarming family film this really does a good job. Although in my opinion it falls just short of a truly brilliant film, I really enjoyed it and it's a worthy entry in the 'against the odds' sports genre.",8,0,1,30 November 2014
Flight," Good study of addiction
","Rather than the straightforward action film I was expecting, Flight is really a character study of one mans addiction. The crash scene is very well done but this is really a small part of the film. The remainder of the film is taken up with the crash investigation as the case against the pilot grows.The film is carried by Denzil Washington who plays a refreshingly flawed anti-hero. Your sympathies for the character swing wildly throughout the film which is something you don't normally get in glossy movies. It is always absorbing as the case builds towards the conclusion of the investigation. I know some people did not like the ending however I found it to be very satisfying. The only real negative for me was a strange and wildly over the top cameo from John Goodman which I found out of place with the rest of the film. Flight is an intriguing film with a superb lead performance from Washington and well worth watching.",8,2,3,16 September 2014
Easy A," Good Rom-Com
","I'm not a massive fan of this genre but occasionally a Rom-Com comes along that is worth watching for the normal guy. This is one of those films. The plot is pretty standard but it is really the performance of Emma Stone that lifts this above the standard Rom-Com. She is captivating as the girl who tells a white lie that gets her reputation sullied throughout college, and really is a star of the future.Although there are few surprises throughout the film there are enough funny moments and witty dialogue to stop the film meandering into the mundane. A pretty good effort.",7,0,0,18 November 2012
Gladiator," Modern classic
","This is a wonderfully filmed classic about a roman general turned gladiator who lives to avenge the death of his wife and child. It's a long film but it rarely drags thanks some great fight scenes and a towering performance from Russel Crowe as the gladiator Maximus. There are great performances throughout from Oliver Reed as the slave seller and an amazing performance from Joaquin Phoenix as the sniveling and cowardly Commodus. Gladiator is similar to another epic Spartacus but thanks to a superior dialogue and better fight scenes this even eclipses that great movie. It has all the ingredients a great film needs, a great cast, good story, believable dialogue, great cinematography and a great ending. There is very little you can fault this film for. Maybe it's running time but even though I watched the extended version no scene seemed superfluous. Without doubt of one of the best films of the modern era and a film that will be much loved for years to come.",10,1,3,23 June 2013
The Birds," Memorable suspense. One of Hitchcock's best.
",The Birds is one of my favourite Hitchcock films and one of his creepiest. A small town begins to suffer attacks by a growing number of birds. On paper it sounds a bit silly but in the hands of a top director this turns into an enjoyable horror. This is a horror film that relies mainly on foreboding suspense rather than copious amounts of gore. And this is delivers in spades. The ominous bird scenes are handled magnificently as are the bird attacks themselves which still hit home today even over 50 years later. The characters are believable if not entirely likable especially the lead Tippi Hendren. Although strangely enough this somehow only adds to the film. The ending is superbly ambiguous leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusion. The Birds is a great film by a great director.,10,4,8,23 February 2015
