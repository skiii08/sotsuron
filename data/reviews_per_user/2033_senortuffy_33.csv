Mission: Impossible III," Same Old ... Stuff
","Mission Impossible III (Roman numbers, no less) is a standard action film with lots of stunts and non-stop .... well, action. Action is the key word because if you're looking for character development or deep meaning, you've checked out the wrong film.Tom Cruise plays an agent in the Impossible Missions Force, which puts him in the same league as Team America. His mission, should he agree to accept it (duh), is to take down an evil arms dealer and recover 'The Rabbits Foot.' No, I'm not making this up.My biggest problem with this film is that it offers nothing new. We've seen this picture under different titles about a hundred times. It's standard fare all gussied up with clever stunts and computer animation.Tom Cruise isn't my idea of an action hero. He's too short and not rugged enough. He was terrific as the creepy hit-man in 'Collateral,' but he doesn't project as the larger than life character necessary for this type of film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is the evil arms dealer, which is another stretch. Ving Rhames and Laurence Fishburne play minor parts in what amounts to casting overkill.MI3 is decent entertainment and not the worst way to spend an evening, but if you're expecting to see acting that's above the cartoon character level, you'll be disappointed.",6,0,0,3 November 2006
Catch Me If You Can," DiCaprio makes up for 'Gangs ...'
","This is a very funny comedy/drama about a young kid who goes on a binge around the country posing as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  Expertly directed by Steven Spielberg, this is one of his finest, and shows a side of him I didn't think was there.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Frank Abagnale, Jr. and Christopher Walkin plays his father, Frank, Sr.  The two are an absolute gas together.  Senior's life is going down the tubes - his business goes under, the IRS is harassing him, and his wife leaves for another man.  The happy home young Frank knows is no longer there.  The father gives a healthy disrespect for the law and authority to his son, so young Frank decides one day to pose as an airline pilot.  He learns how to make fake identifications and phony airline checks, and off he goes.  In short time, he's living the lifestyle of a swinging bachelor, even though he's still a teenager.  He gets away with it because he's a great con artist and thinks quick on his feet, and he's so good at producing fake payroll checks that the FBI is soon on his tail.Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent after DiCaprio, and he does his usual superb acting job, playing the agent as a determined loner.  Without giving up the details, Hanks eventually catches the young man, who after exhausting his airline pilot facade has gone on to pose as a doctor in charge of an emergency room and then a lawyer.  The kid is so good at what he does, that the FBI hires him in lieu of a stiff sentence so that he can teach them how criminals manipulate the banking system.This film is absolutely charming.  The acting is great and the viewer is enthralled at the amazing exploits of this young criminal.  Walkin in particular deserved an Oscar (he was only nominated for best supporting actor).  His manic character and determination are the inspiration by which his son embarks on his adventurous life of crime.  And after his disastrous performance in 'Gangs of New York,' it's nice to see DiCaprio rebound with a winner.",8,1,2,21 July 2003
The Ring," I always knew my tv would get me.
","This is a very scary film about people who die seven days after watching a mysterious videotape.  It's been compared to 'The Sixth Sense' and that's a fair statement.  Both films involve death and extrasensory perception, and both involve someone reaching out from the grave to the living.The story is about a reporter, Naomi Watts, who discovers that her niece died at the exact same moment as her boyfriend and another couple.  Upon some investigation, she discovers that all four watched this videotape together.  She tracks the tape down and watches it herself, and then the phone rings and a little girl's voice tells her she has seven days to live.I don't want to give away any more of the plot or the ending, but suffice it to say that it's a scary ride.  The mood of the film is enhanced by the spooky images throughout, of scenes where time is warped.  You're given little clues during the woman's search for what's behind the video, but the ending is surprising nonetheless.It's a good horror film.  And wouldn't you know it, about five minutes after I turned off my television set and was standing alone in an empty house thinking about what I'd just seen, the tv turned itself back on ......

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to lose an audience .......
","I'm sure you know the basic premise of this movie:  girl gets assignment to write an article on how to lose a guy in ten days, guy takes a bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him in ten days.  Nice setup.  So, why aren't I laughing?This is a classic battle of the sexes, mistaken identity comedy, the kind audiences have been entertained by for centuries.  I kept thinking this was a 60's movie, that Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant or even Doris Day and Rock Hudson would have taken the premise and made into a classic out of it.  Was it just the actors?Matthew McConaughey is a very handsome man, but he's not a very good actor. He delivers his lines in a steady monotone, as he does in pretty much every movie I've ever seen him in.  There's no inflection in his voice, and he doesn't know how to milk a scene, which is necessary in comedy.  He may be eye candy for the ladies, but the movie flatlines every time he's on the screen.Kate Hudson is a pretty good actress - you can really see her mother's influnce on her comedy skills in this movie - but she can't carry this film. For one, her character lacks a foil to work off of - McConaughey is much too serious.  Plus the script has her being a bit too obnoxious for my liking.  There's a nasty edge to the plot to dump her guy, and that just doesn't work in a comedy.If this were a 60's movie, you'd have an entire ensemble of comedians playing secondary roles, like Paul Lynde or Thelma Diamond, to keep the laughter going.  But here, the supporting cast draws a blank.  Hudson's boss at the magazine should have been played for humor, but instead she's mean-spirited and controlling.  The two female rivals at McConaughey's advertising firm are conniving and hard.  The only bit players who understand this is a comedy are Robert Klein and Liliane Montevecchi (the jeweler's wife).As a love story, it doesn't really work either because you're left wondering at the final scene where they reconcile on the Brooklyn Bridge whether these two really know each other.  I mean, they've been role playing the entire movie, and except for a brief moment at his parent's house, they really never let their guards down.  They look good together, and I guess in this modern era of movie making, that's supposed to be enough.Mildly entertaining and funny at times, but you'd have to consider this movie a failure.",6,1,2,20 July 2003
Insomnia," Suspense thriller delivers.
","Al Pacino plays Will Dormer, a Los Angeles detective sent to Alaska to investigate a local murder.  He and his partner are under investigation by Internal Affairs and their captain decides they need to get out of town for awhile.  Christopher Nolan ('Memento') directs this remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name.  The title refers to the fact that they're so far north that there's 24 hours of sunlight in the summer and it's hard for newcomers to sleep.Pacino plays a familiar role, that of a world-weary cop (see 'Heat'), but he's so good at it I didn't mind.  During the course of trailing the killer, he accidentally shoots his partner who came up from LA with him.  The situation is complicated by the fact that his partner was about to testify against him for planting evidence on a murder suspect.  Dormer can't tell the truth because no one will believe him so he lies, and the lies lead to more lies and more bad police work.Other actors who turn in good performances are Robin Williams as the wacked out killer.  I never would have guessed it ten years ago, but he's turned into a pretty good character actor when it comes to creepy parts.  Hillary Swank stands out as the local police officer who idolizes Dormer - she studied his casework while in the academy.  She's young and idealistic, everything Dormer used to be, and it's interesting to see the interplay between the two as Dormer tries to hide what he knows she's going to find out eventually.The cinematography is excellent - Wally Pfister returns from 'Memento.' The Alaska scenery is overpowering, perhaps suggesting the smallness of the people who live there.  The constant daylight interspersed with dreary rain and fog accentuate the state of mind Pacino's character is going through, the mental deterioration from lack of sleep and the stress of having to hide the facts about his partner's death.  There is never any night time, and despite the attraction of the younger female cop, no romantic interest to help him forget.  It's just Pacino getting more and more stressed out.
I really enjoyed this film.  The direction and acting were excellent all around.",8,0,0,24 August 2003
A Bridge Too Far," Ridiculous World War II drama.
","This silly tripe is about a failed Allied attempt to seize the bridge at Arnhem during the fall of 1944.  If successful, it would have opened up an invasion of the Ruhr Valley in Germany and ended the war earlier.Made during the mid-Seventies, this film reflects the anti-war sentiment of the time.  The generals are depicted as inept and cowardly, the Allied armies disorganized for the most part.  It does reach back to the gung-ho war pictures of the John Wayne era in an attempt to pump some bravado into the action, but the dialogue is so ludicrous and the characters so transparent that it all falls flat.  The scenes with Anthony Hopkins are painful to watch, and can anyone believe Robert Redford as an Army major who says 'please' when rallying his troops?William Goldman has written some excellent scripts, but this one was just terrible.  And who knows what director Richard Attenborough was trying to say.  Maybe his cameo as a lunatic in the woods razzing the British Army was the hidden message.",4,12,31,29 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Spectacular adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy.
","Some movies are to be avoided because they can never live up to the book, and since 'The Lord of the Rings' is one of the finest novels ever written, I have to admit I put off seeing this movie for a long time.  The second installment is out on video now, so I felt compelled to give the first one a go.  Boy, was I pleasantly surprised.This is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made.  The story is a simple one - evil is upon the world and a small band of do-gooders must venture out to save the world from enveloping darkness.  Good versus evil, pretty basic stuff.But it's much deeper than that.  'Lord of the Rings' takes on religious meaning, as temptation, envy, spirituality versus materialism, the fellowship of man, and many other themes play out in this story.  It's part fairy tale but it's also an allegory of modern times.The cast of actors was well-chosen for their ability to portray characters whose personal traits are out in the open (this isn't a film for Brando-ish displays of angst and emotion).Ian McKellen is the gruff but wise old wizard who shepherds the fellowship through trials and tribulations as they journey to bring the ring back to where it was created.  Elijah Wood plays a wide-eyed young hobbit named Frodo (nephew of Bilbo Baggins, central character in 'The Hobbit' - Tolkien's prelude to the Ring Trilogy).  Frodo is the ring bearer, the individual who's been entrusted with returning the ring to be destroyed so that evil forces may never again use it's power.Viggo Mortensen plays Strider, the Ranger who's trekked all over Middle Earth and who's the perfect guide for Frodo and his band.  He's one of the humans in the group and displays familiar emotions for the human viewers/readers to connect with - sadness over his lost love, bravery in battle, a kind of regal bearing (he is, after all, really Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor).Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith in the Matrix series) plays Elrond, leader of the half-elves in Rivendale, and displays a combination of authority and alien presence to make his part very believable.  Liv Tyler plays Arwen Evenstar, the lovely daughter of Elrond and the love interest for Strider.The Welsh actor, John Rhys-Davies, plays Gimli, a leader of the race of dwarves.  Cate Blanchett plays Galadriel, the elven Lady of the Woods, who also bears one of the original rings and who advises Frodo on what he must do to save all of Middle Earth from Sauren, the evil one.  And Christopher Lee is terrific as Saruman, Gandalf's mentor and head of the order of wizards who's gone over to the dark side and now serves the forces of evil.The cinematography (Andrew Lesnie from the 'Babe' films) is stunning and the special effects are seamlessly woven into the real pictures, much less intrusive than in any film like this that I've ever seen.   Peter Jackson's decision to make this film in New Zealand was a brilliant decision because the colors are so vibrant and the landscape foreign enough and without 21st century hindrances as to make it a believable substitute for Middle Earth.'Lord of the Rings' will probably go down in cinema history as one of the great ones.  It should appeal to viewers of all age groups as its story is timeless and transcends all cultural barriers.  A must see.",10,1,3,14 September 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Needless addendum to the series.
","This is a fairly entertaining sci-fi action film, but it pales in comparison to the original Terminator movies.  It's lacking in artistic direction and the cast is weak.  James Cameron is a terrific storyteller and takes care of the minutest of details, but here the events just happen without proper sequencing. Jonathon Mostow is in way over his head.  The acting is also a problem.  Arnold is good as the Terminator, but Nick Stahl is very bad in the role of John Connor.  There's nothing heroic about him at all.  Eddie Furlong was a tough kid and you could buy him growing up to be a leader of the humans in the future, but Stahl doesn't suggest anything other than a future 7-11 clerk.  Also, there's no Linda Hamilton character, no strong female lead - Claire Danes brings nothing to the table.  Kristanna Loken is alright as the T-X sent back to kill John Connor, but she isn't required to do much acting what with the computer animators doing most of it for her. Why did they make this movie?  There was nothing left from the second film that needed to be clarified, nothing here clever enough to add to the Terminator myth.  It was made only for the sake of money, but with production costs so high, even that didn't work.As a stand alone film, it's OK entertainment.  There's lots of action and the special effects are good.  There's even some humor written into the script.  But when you look at it in the context of 'T2-Judgement Day' it's a major disappointment.Thankfully, with Arnold as governor now, we don't have to worry about another sequel.  Even these producers couldn't be stupid enough to make a Terminator 4 without Arnold.",7,0,0,12 November 2003
U-571," Mediocre war drama.
","This film is about a mission to capture an Enigma code machine from a disabled German U-boat and it has its moments.  There are some exciting battle scenes and there are men acting bravely under duress, but the bottom line is it offers nothing that we haven't seen before in other movies.Matthew McConaughey makes an unlikely senior officer of an American sub who takes over command when the captain (Bill Paxson) is killed.  Harvey Keitel is the chief petty officer, an old salt who's seen action in WWI.  Jon Bon Jovi plays one of the seamen.  As you can see, this isn't John Wayne and Lee Marvin, it's MTV goes to war.The true story of the capture of the Enigma and the code book in 1942 actually involved a British commando team, not an American one as shown in this film, and there wasn't any dramatic confrontation with a German destroyer.  I know this is a bone of contention with the Brits, our stealing their thunder.The producers could just as easily made this film with a British cast and stuck more closely to the truth, but I think the criticism coming from across the pond belies a bit of insecurity from our allies.  It's only a movie.  It's a dramatization, not a documentary.  I've seen a number of British films where Americans are pointlessly made to look bad, so let's not make too big a deal on this point.Decent entertainment once you accept the unlikely group of seamen.",6,0,2,7 December 2003
American Beauty," Beautiful but flawed.
","I have a dichotomy of opinion on this film.  From an artistic standpoint, it's terrific.  The acting and direction are very good, and the story line is clever and interesting.  But the message underlying the film bothers me quite a bit.First the praise.Kevin Spacey is simply excellent as Lester Burnham, a middle-aged man drifting through life with no direction until he develops this crush on his daughter's luscious girlfriend.  All of a sudden, Lester develops character and some backbone.  He gets the inspiration to tell off his prudish wife (Annette Bening), a career-minded real estate broker who's sexually withdrawn from him.  He tells off the new personnel man at work and gets himself fired with a sweet severance package.  Lester begins working out, to develop muscles for his new crush, and starts smoking $2000 an ounce pot with the kid next door.  Kevin Spacey is tremendously funny in his understated way.  He isn't overtly hostile to others, but he defends his newfound freedom in the most subtle ways, like when he catches his wife cheating on him.Chris Cooper is also excellent as the ex-marine who moves in next door and immediately starts suspecting that there's something wrong with his goofy neighbor.  He's both a scary character as when he acts out against his son and a pathetic creature when he comes to Spacey for comfort. 
Annette Bening's performance is a little too on the surface - you don't get much insight into her character.  I didn't realize at first it really was her - I thought is was someone trying to act like Annette Bening.  Wes Bentley is very good as Ricky Fitts, the kid next door who develops a crush on Spacey's daughter (a high school goth who hates her parents).  His weirdness and emotional detachment underscore the central theme of this movie.Which takes me to the part I didn't like, the underlying message of this film.  If some future archaeologists ever uncover a DVD of this film, they'll have some real insight into why American civilization collapsed in the 21st century.  I mean, the negativity about family life and personal relationships is deadly.  What does this film say about how we picture ourselves?  That we're chronic screwups who can't relate to one another and that there's no hope for a familial relationship in our society?I was captivated by this film as I watched it, but it did leave me with an uncomfortable feeling when it ended.  It was as if some great force had sucked all the emotional life right out of the universe and all we were left with was moral equivocation, aimless thought.  Some people - well, a lot of people obviously disagree with my reservations (it is rated in the Imdb top 30), but I can't help but feel this film reflects poorly on our culture.",8,0,1,14 March 2004
The Patriot," Revolutionary fluff.
","This movie tugs at all the viewer's heartstrings as it portrays a family transformed by the American Revolution, but it is totally lacking in depth.
Mel Gibson is miscast as the family patriarch raising seven children on a South Carolina plantation.  As in 'Braveheart', he is womanless, which I suppose was supposed to make him look more noble in our eyes.  But it only makes for awkward moments with his sister-in-law, Joely Richardson.  And as in 'Braveheart', the movie only picks up when Mel works himself into a rage.
But that's about the extent of the emotional range shown by the movie's lead - awkward nobility and rage.  Mel as everyman just doesn't fly (Harrison Ford who is great in that kind of role turned down the part).  While I like him as an actor in certain parts, Mel Gibson just doesn't make this a very interesting movie.  He's too modern and doesn't belong in a period piece, as shown by his equally weak performance in 'Mutiny on the Bounty.'
Another thing that annoyed me was all the leading American characters were played by non-Americans:  Mel Gibson, the patriot of the title (Aussie); Heath Ledger, his son (Aussie); Joely Richardson, Mel's love interest (British); Rene Auberjonois, a minister who joins the rebellion (Swiss/French).  Chris Cooper was the only American in a lead role.  I don't want to be nationalistic in a movie review, but you'd think the producers could come up with an American cast when making a movie about the Revolution.Another sore point was how blacks were perceived in the movie.  From the opening shot where a black woman in the kitchen fusses over Mel's children like they're filming a floor wax commercial, the whole treatment of blacks in the South is antiseptic.  At times, the black characters are embarassing to watch.  You'd never know slavery was a bad thing from watching this movie.  Walt Disney could have written the script the way blacks were portrayed.The best roles are reserved for the British villains.  Jason Isaacs plays the sneering Colonel Tavington, and his character is evil personified. Anticipating his inevitable death is about all that carries the movie for the last hour.  The very capable British character actor, Tom Wilkinson, is cast as General Cornwallis and is superb in the part.
Eye candy for the most part, especially for the ladies who drool at the mention of Mel's name, and clearly designed to play to our emotions, but for the most part, this movie fails to break out of the mold of pedestrian entertainment.",5,7,15,3 February 2003
Ocean's Eleven," Vacuous entertainment.
","This is a weak remake of a movie that wasn't very good in the first place. 
There's no acting per se - just the plot, a casino robbery.  George Clooney plays George Clooney, Brad Pitt plays Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts is The Girl. Elliott Gould looks old, Carl Reiner is old.  The actors do just enough to advance the story, nothing else.  There is no character development, just characters.And the plot isn't good enough to carry the show.  The film is basically the planning and execution of a casino robbery, and the way they carry it out isn't a bit believable.  I don't know what Steven Soderbergh was thinking of when he made this film. It's the equivalent of airline food - it looks like a movie, but it's really just a cardboard imitation of one.  And of course, they're filming a sequel, because ....... it made money.",5,0,1,1 August 2003
Die Hard 2," Beware plot holes
","This is a decent followup to the first 'Die Hard' movie.  It lacks a villain with personality like Alan Rickman, but the action is pretty good and for the fans it follows the same formula as the original.What bothered me while watching a tape of it recently were the gigantic plot holes in the story, some of them big enough to fly a 747 through.For instance, the whole mission to rescue General Esperanza was awful time consuming.  They were on the ground nearly an hour before finally making their escape.  Seems to me if you were gonna get away with this, you'd have to have him off the plane and out of the airport within minutes, not an hour.And how could they have foreseen a snow storm fouling up visibility?   The bad guys must have planned this months in advance and couldn't possibly have know what the weather would be like.  If it had been clear and mild that evening, there wouldn't have been enough confusion to allow the escape to drag out so long.Also, if the control tower was knocked out, would the planes continue to circle Dulles for hours?   If you were the pilot, would you just go round and round til you ran out of fuel?  Washington is close enough to Philadelphia and Baltimore, where the airports could have handled the planes forced to divert from Dulles.Finally, even if terrorists took over the airport communications system, the regular phone lines were still up.  If they were cut also, then someone would have had a cell phone.  Why didn't anyone on airport security call in the cavalry?These flaws in the story line kept nagging at me while I was watching the movie, but if you can suspend your belief in reality, this isn't such a bad movie to sit back and enjoy.",6,1,2,15 January 2004
Saving Private Ryan," Tough look at the horrors of war.
","I had put off watching this film because I'd heard it was so bloody and I wasn't sure I wanted to see it.  Well, it lived up to its billing.  The scenes of war look very realistic and it's a shocking experience to watch.I enjoyed the film, but not as much as Spielberg's other WWII film, 'Schindler's List.'  I suppose it's because of the comparative lack of drama.  Tom Hanks is a terrific actor but his character doesn't draw you in like Liam Neeson's did.  I didn't relate to the people in 'Saving Private Ryan' the way I did in 'Schindler.'  It's probably not a fair comparison to make, but that was my reaction anyway.The premise bothered me a little bit too.  Sure, saving the lone remaining child of a family is important, but did it make sense to send a company of men out during the days right after the landing at Normandy to save one person?  Things were chaotic then and success wasn't assured by any means, and I think the military's focus would have been elsewhere.  I don't know what the real circumstances were that the film was based on, but the director did make the mission seem worthy by having the men defend a vital bridge from the Germans after they caught up with Ryan. 
It's a complicated subject, war, and while this movie is very good, I'm not sure I agree with the focus of this film as a way of portraying patriotism.",8,0,0,9 August 2003
The Pianist," One man's struggle to survive.
","This film wasn't nearly as good as I expected.  It tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, Poland's most accomplished pianist, who escaped the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.  This is not the assault on your emotions that 'Schindler's List' was.  Rather, it's pretty much a tale of survival, how one man plumbs the depths of humanity and survives to play his beloved music again.Adrien Brody plays Szpilman, and he does it well.  He has to because one of my complaints is that there's little character development other than Szpilman.  We're introduced to his family in Warsaw and get to know them, but they're carted off to the death camps before the halfway point of the movie.  One of the best lines in the film occurs here.  Szpilman tells his sister as she's about to be loaded into a freight car, 'I know this is an awkward time to say this, but I wish I knew you better.'  She smiles back warmly at him. Very real and very touching.But after Szpilman is pulled out of the line by a friend and spared, it's basically just him for the second half of the movie.  We meet people on his work crew where he's found refuge and the people in the underground who help him hide from the Nazis, but they're only on screen briefly and are never really developed as characters in the film.  The closest we get to seeing into the soul of another person is when a Nazi officer finds him hiding in the attic of a bombed-out building and gives him food and a coat to wear.  But even here, the Nazi captain, played by Thomas Kletschmann, is only in the film for a few minutes and then reappears briefly in the end where he's about to be shipped off to his death in a Russian prison camp.Adrien Brody plays his part well, but he's not an expressive actor, at least not in this role.  He looks dignified and a bit aloof at first, then develops the mournful gaze of someone who's seen too many bad things, but it's all in the eyes.  There isn't a whole lot of dialogue other than what's needed to advance the story.Not a bad film, but not a classic.  An interesting tale of one man's determination to survive, but it could just as easily been about someone trapped on a deserted island as it was about someone in wartime Poland.",7,0,0,25 July 2003
Seabiscuit," Stirring tale about adversity and success.
","'Seabiscuit' is a very compelling film about one of the greatest race horses of all time and how he overcame adversity during the roughest of times to capture the hearts of America.  There's so much to tell about the horse, the people surrounding him, and the era in which he raced, but the movie concentrates on two events in Seabiscuit's life, his victory in a match race with the reigning Triple Crown winner, War Admiral, and his comeback from a ruptured tendon to win the Santa Anita Derby.Along for the ride are 'Red' Pollard, the horse's jockey, who is a story in and of himself.  Abandoned during the Depression by his parents, he becomes a jockey of minor importance until he connects with Seabiscuit.  He also comes back from an injury to his leg and rides the horse in his triumphal return.Seabiscuit's trainer is Tom Smith, a fringe player at best, who loves horses and knows how to communicate with them.  He's asked to pick out a horse for Charles Howard, a wealthy car dealer in California who wants to get into the business.  He selects a small one who's ornery and hard to train, but who he thinks has a lot of heart.I didn't think there was anything special about the directing in this movie - the story is so good it kind of tells itself.  The scenes involving the races themselves were better than in most films of this sort.  There's a built-in problem of filming a horse race because of the impossibility of placing a camera in the right spot and capturing all the action in one take. Plus, there's no way to really capture the huge crowds that followed Seabiscuit by using a few hundred extras and some clever camera angles. Still, the action was exciting.Jeff Bridges did an excellent job of playing Seabiscuit's owner, Charles Howard.  He too has faced adversity - the Depression hurts his business, his son dies in an accident, and his wife leaves him.  His speeches championing America's horse and his support for 'Red' Pollard and all the other underdogs in life are heartwarming and frame the story.Chris Cooper is very good playing Tom Smith in an understated way.  He's the old pro who doesn't get excited very much, and his role in the film is to support Jeff Bridges and Tobey Maguire, who plays the jockey, 'Red' Pollard. Maguire seems a little out of his element in this role but he does alright with it.  The real surprise is Gary Stevens, a real jockey, who is excellent as George Woolf, maybe the most famous rider of his time and who takes over for Pollard when he's injured.  Stevens has several important scenes and handles them like a real pro.Definitely a film worth watching even if you're not a horse racing fan. It's a real feel-good story and the producers were smart to put it out right before Christmas.",8,0,0,16 December 2003

JFK," Historical drama about one of the most important events in our lifetime.
","'JFK' opens with a clip of President Eisenhower delivering his famous farewell speech where he warns the American people about the pervasive power of the military industrial complex.  Director Oliver Stone treats it as an omen of things to come.I'd seen this film when it was released theatrically and just the other day I rented the directors cut on video, and there's no other way to regard this film than as a masterpiece of American cinema.  No other event in recent history has impacted our lives more than the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Oliver Stone presents his theory about the events surrounding that November day, basing it all on verifiable facts that are meticulously presented throughout the film.  What he's saying is that a coup d'etat probably took place against the President of the United States and that it was carried out by people within our government who considered Kennedy a communist sympathizer and traitor.  The huge defense contracts that were contingent on our government pursuing a pro-war policy in Vietnam also were a factor in his assassination.I'm not an expert on these matters.  I lived through the Sixties and vividly recall the day Kennedy was shot.  I also remember the aftershocks when Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy were assassinated in 1968.  Those were strange times and the American people weren't sophisticated enough to understand everything that was bubbling beneath the surface.  Oliver Stone has obviously researched this subject thoroughly, and I find his explanations very plausible.Perhaps the best argument for a coup having occurred takes place when Donald Sutherland's character, a mysterious black ops ex-military man, explains it all to Jim Garrison during a walk around the Reflecting Pool in Washington. It's a terrific scene and one that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  This character puts everything into context, the history of the CIA from the end of World War II through the Cold War, and when he's done, you can't help but feel some people in our government had Kennedy killed.The acting in this film is terrific.  Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the New Orleans attorney investigating the assassination, very well.  His closing argument in the trial of Clay Shaw where he presents all the evidence of a conspiracy to the jury is a classic scene. 
Besides Donald Sutherland, several other great actors take turns playing bit parts:  Walter Mathau plays a cynical Sen. Long, Ed Asner plays an ex-FBI agent turned rabid rightwinger with chilling accuracy, Jack Lemmon plays a drunken hanger-on, Gary Oldman is good as Lee Harvey Oswald.  There are many others but I can only name a few.The blending of dramatic action and real news clips taken at the time is superb.  Oliver Stone builds his story scene by scene, revelation by revelation, until the dramatic ending where Garrison makes his case to the jury.  Only the most stubborn, ignorant viewer could disagree with his conclusion that a coup d'etat took place that day.  The idea that Oswald acted alone is just plain ludicrous.Kennedy's assassination is the greatest mystery of our time.  Will we ever learn the truth or has it been buried forever?  I'd like to believe we're strong enough as a nation to survive the shock of knowing what really happened, but I have my doubts whether the government will ever release the files locked up.Until then, this movie will have to stand as the defining explanation of what happened November 22nd, 1963.",9,7,23,19 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Just as spectacular as the first installment of the Trilogy.
","I have to admit, I'm completely won over by the masterful work director Peter Jackson has done with Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.  I'm not particularly a fan of George Lucas' 'Star Wars' movies and thought the 'Star Trek' films to be inconsistent, so fantasy isn't exactly my thing.  But after watching 'Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' back to back the past few nights, I'm absolutely stunned by the magnitude of the achievement here.This film picks up right where the first installment left off, with the fellowship having dissolved.  Frodo leaves with Sam as company so that he may take the ring to Mordor and destroy it in the fire from which it was created.  The others leave to fight the battle for Middle Earth as Saruman has unleashed his army from Isengard.The battle scenes between the men of Rohan and their elf allies against the urik-hai, the half men, half orc creatures bred by Saruman, are amazing. Digital technology plays a major part in these scenes, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is so seamless with the real cinematography that the result is just stunning.Gollum, a digitally created image, plays a major part in this installment. He's one of the classic characters in Tolkien's work, and I wondered how they could possibly portray him as I imagined, but the result is perfect. The digital artists struck just the right balance between a prowling little creature attempting to regain the ring and a pitiful figure twisted by its power.Like the first movie in the trilogy, this one is long (three hours plus), but it's such an epic film and full of so many characters and so much detail, that you're sucked in anyways.  At times, you're reminded of Shakespeare, and at other times one of those Disney cartoons from before the war, like 'Snow White.'  These films are a wonderful creation and I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I have.  'The Return of the King' should be awesome.",10,1,1,15 September 2003
Mulholland Drive," Totally bizarre .... but good
","A David Lynch film is kinda like taking acid.  There are moments of ecstasy, moments of unease, and moments when you're not sure what's real and what isn't.  You kinda have an intuitive feel of what's going on but you can't explain it in words.  You just have to go with the flow.The concept of movies within movies has been done before.  Maurizio Nichetti made a very humorous film, 'The Icicle Thief' (1989), by warping reality with this technique and reminding us how silly modern life is.  Here, David Lynch presents us with a darker vision of modern Hollywood by blending different lives with one another.I can't say for sure what it all means, but it's an interesting trip.",7,0,0,30 September 2003
Black Hawk Down," Very intense war film.
","This was a hard movie to watch.  It was excellent in its portrayal of the battle in Mogadishu but the action got so intense and had so few pauses that I had to turn the tape off at one point to take account of my senses. Ridley Scott does an excellent job directing the intense street battles between the Rangers and the Somali militias.  The fighting begins pretty early in the movie and continues unabated right up til the end.  Even with all the action going on, he still finds a way to personalize some of the characters. Tempering the film is the sadness of knowing how messed up the battle preparations were, how the politicians back in Washington didn't allow the men to go in with proper cover (armored vehicles were held back until the rescue operation).  Also, there is the knowledge that despite these men's heroics, nothing ever changed in Somalia. Not a film for everyone, but well done nonetheless.",8,0,1,17 November 2003
The Insider," Excellent suspense drama.
","You wouldn't think a film about a corporate whistleblower could be as exciting as this one, but Michael Mann did a superb job of keeping this viewer on the edge of his seat for two and a half hours.  He doesn't make many films - this one came out four years after his previous one, 'Heat' (also excellent) - but the director makes the most of his shots.First of all, the acting is superb.  Russell Crowe is as good in his portrayal of the scientist who blows the tobacco industry's dirty little secret as he was playing Maximus in 'Gladiator' - he was nominated for an Oscar as best leading actor (Mann was nominated for director also).  Neither of them won, nor did anyone else associated with this film, so maybe the tobacco thugs were getting the final word after all.Crowe handles this difficult part extremely well.  Dr. Wigand is a man tortured with inner doubts.  Does he do what he knows is right, expose the tobacco industry for peddling an addictive drug under the guise of an innocent agricultural product, or does he knuckle under to corporate pressure to keep quiet?  Complicating his life is a wife who doesn't want to take risks, who resents their lowered economic status, and who eventually deserts him when he needs all the moral support he can get.  Cameron Crowe reveals all these inner conflicts in a most believable way and makes his character a hero without the usual props.Al Pacino plays the '60 Minutes' producer, Lowell Bergman, in his usual fine manner.  He's a bit of a crusader, and the film takes some liberties in the truth to build up his character, but he comes off well without being too overbearing.  Christopher Plummer is also excellent as Mike Wallace.  And the rest of the cast is very good too.  But it's a tribute to Crowe's acting skills that he was able to outshine Pacino in a movie that was made for him.And the best part of this film is that it is, except for some dramatic enhancements, true.  Dr. Wigand's testimony was the start of tearing apart the veneer of invulnerability the tobacco industry had managed to create for itself.  Since that '60 Minutes' piece, these huge corporations have been forced to pay out enormous sums to litigants harmed by their products, and that is really a sweet thing.",9,2,3,3 December 2003
From Hell," Hollywood treatment of the Ripper murders.
","Johnny Depp plays an Inspector Abberline who is assigned to investigate the murders in Whitechapel attributed to Jack the Ripper.  The film follows the theory explored in an earlier film, 'Murder by Decree' (1979), that the Ripper murders were really the act of a mad palace surgeon who was killing the witnesses to a scandal involving Prince Edward.I can't think of a more unlikely pair of actors to portray Victorian Londoners than Johnny Depp and Heather Graham.  No matter how they tried to cover it up with elaborate costuming and bad accents, I kept seeing a surfer dude and a valley girl on the screen.  Depp is a pretty decent actor but he was just wrong for this role.The supporting cast is pretty good.  Ian Holm is particularly good as Sir William Gull, the mad surgeon who goes about disemboweling the young women. Ian Richardson has a prominent role as Depp's boss, but the script doesn't give him much leeway to act.The production values are slick, and the director went to great lengths to make the sets look authentic, but the film lacked any inner conviction. 'Murder by Decree' made more of a social commentary about the perversity of the royal family and the social structure of Britain at the end of the 19th century.  Here, sensationalism seems to be the dominant theme.Maybe if the movie had been directed by somebody besides the Hughes Brothers it could have been more complex.  They should stick to hip hop culture.",6,4,7,24 August 2003
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The fire grows dim
","This is the fourth film in the Harry Potter series, and the franchise seems to be running out of steam. Not as fresh as the others, this one seems repetitive in its story line and almost tedious. At a running time of over two and a half hours, it drags at times.The threesome of Harry, Hermione, and Weasley are now in their mid-teens and beginning to show interest in the opposite sex. The story line about Harry facing up to the dark forces that killed his parents is advanced some, though a final resolution is obviously being left for a future film. Some well-done computer imaging almost makes up for the lack of a good plot.The supporting cast is pretty amazing. The best actors in British film play a variety of roles. Ralph Fiennes shows up near the end as the evil one, Lord Voldemort. Miranda Richardson plays a ditzy gossip columnist, Rita Skeeter. Brendan Gleeson is introduced as a crazy one-eyed professor. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, and Jason Isaacs all return in roles played in previous Potter films.I think the director tried to cram too much into the film, but overall, it's good entertainment. Future films will certainly deal with the confrontation with Voldemort and the question of any love interest between Harry and Hermione, but I hope the next director eases off on the special effects and gets a good scriptwriter instead.",7,0,1,5 November 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Rather pointless sequel.
","This film really wasn't necessary from an artistic standpoint.  The first Matrix film had a conclusion - Neo reached enlightenment and gained freedom from the matrix.  You didn't know exactly how he was to break the matrix down, but you assumed it would happen.But now we have this sequel, and there is to be a third installment, presumably the final one.  It's understandable that the filmmakers want to make a few more bucks, but the sequel isn't as good as the original.The computer graphics continue to be stunning, but nothing is new here, just a continuation of the technique developed before.  The central characters return - Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).  Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) also returns but he's more caricature than character this time around.Several new members of the crew and the city of Zion are introduced, but the actors portraying them are not very good and they detract from the main story.  There is also some unnecessary melodrama - a jealous spat between Morpheus and the Zion commander over a woman, a wife angry that her husband spends too much time following Morpheus around.  The romantic angle between Neo and Trinity also takes up much of the movie.The original left some loose ends, but it was better that way.  It dealt with the matrix in allegorical terms, whereas this sequel (and presumably the final chapter) seem determined to define everything for the viewer. Sometimes, it's better left to the imagination.",6,0,0,15 October 2003
Blow," Well done story but hard to sympathize with the hero.
","'Blow' is a film about the life of George Jung, one of the major smugglers of cocaine into this country during the Seventies.  Johnny Depp plays the character as a laid back adventurer, having fun with his friends in the drug business.  Pee Wee Herman plays his gay friend in Los Angeles who handles the distribution.The production values and cinematography are good, and the story's interesting, especially since much of it's based on real life, but lingering over the film is the reality that George Jung wasn't the nice guy you're seeing in Johnny Depp.  At one point in the film, Depp's character narrates that he was responsible for 85% of all the cocaine imported into the United States from the mid-70's to early 80's.  The thought crossed my mind that this was the guy who almost killed me and who caused tens of thousands of people to ruin their lives. True, everyone did drugs of their own free will, but still, George Jung was a bad man.We're supposed to feel sorry for his predicament - busted finally after hs friends set him up and sent away for thirty some years.   Somehow, the tragedy of his daughter refusing to visit him in prison doesn't match the reality of countless daughters never getting to know their fathers because they overdosed on this guy's coke.Entertaining because of the fine acting, but a misguided venture and a film that shouldn't have been made.",6,4,7,17 July 2003
Signs," Lightweight psychodrama.
","I like Mel Gibson as an actor, really, but just not in fatherly roles like he plays here or in 'The Patriot.'  His portrayal of a priest who's lost his faith wrapped around a story of alien invasion just didn't strike me as real.  He's much better as a wise-cracking cop, like in the 'Lethal Weapon' series or the rugged loner in the 'Mad Max' trilogy.The movie centers around a conversation Mel has with his nephew, in which he postulates that there are two kinds of people in this world - those who believe in miracles and destiny, and those who believe things just happen for no real reason.  Mel plays a reverend in a small Pennsylvania farming community who recently lost his wife in a freak auto accident.  He's left the church because of his loss of faith and is now bitter and rudderless in life.  His house is a mess and his family is breaking up.Then one day, crop circles appear in his corn field.  Soon after, strange beings show up on the farm and in the community.  His asthmatic son, played by Macaulay Culkin's younger brother, Rory, is curious about the aliens, sensing right away that this is a real invasion. Mel's daughter, played by the cute-as-a-button Abigail Breslin, seems more awed by what's happening than frightened.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Mel's nephew, who's helping out around the farm, and he's decidedly in the camp of this is all a miracle of some sort.The 'signs' from the title refers to events leading to other events in the lives of the characters.  The movie is supposed to make us realize that all things are connected and that we should look for signs in our lives, but the overall effect is a bit clumsy in the movie.A conversion Mel has with his dying wife in which her last words are, 'Hit away,' ties in with Merrill's (Joaquin Phoenix) skills with a baseball bat, which comes in handy when an alien invades their house and snatches the little boy.  Alot is made of the fact that the boy's asthma actually saves him from the alien's attempt to poison him with some gas.  The asthma is a sign?  God made him asthmatic in order to save him?  That's what Mel thinks.The movie is entertaining and a bit spooky.  Much of the movie feels like you're part of someone's dream, sort of like Shayamalan's 'The Sixth Sense.' But I was expecting something more complex from the appearance of the crop circles, not a straight forward alien invasion complete with boogeymen creatures trying to drag off the children.  Mel's dilemma as he deals with his loss of faith and the impending disaster centers the movie, but I had difficulty interpreting his emotions most of the time.  He doesn't play a character in control, which is what you expect of Mel Gibson.  He's confused and angry and drifts through much of the movie with a blank expression, not seeming to know where he's going, which makes for an awkward story since no one else really picks up the slack.  Drama requires a hero, and that element is lacking in this movie.  The final scene where Mel puts his collar back on seems trite.",6,0,1,8 May 2003
Identity," Agatha Christie meets Norman Bates.
","This is a cleverly written movie about eleven people stranded at a rundown motel during a rainstorm who inexplicably start dying off one by one.  It's not quite your normal Agatha Chrisie murder mystery, because things are definitely not what they seem to be.John Cusack is the main guy in the film - he's an ex-cop turned limo driver who shows up with his frantic B-list movie starlet.  Ray Liotta plays a pushy cop transporting a prisoner.  Amanda Peet plays a hooker on her way to Florida to buy an orange grove in her hometown.  The rest of the cast is lesser knowns who all do decent work keeping the story going.  There's even a creepy desk clerk who's got a body stashed away in the freezer.Without giving away the ending,  I found the plot twist to be fascinating. It took a lot of imagination to think that one up.  And Cusack plays it perfectly.Highly recommend this one.",7,0,1,6 September 2003
Amélie," Life is beautiful.
","Audrey Tautou is Amélie Poulain, a pretty young girl in Paris who's lonely and emotionally withdrawn.  She works in a cafe and watches the world go by and sees how everyone else is lonely too.One day she happens upon a small tin box hidden in the wall by the little boy who lived in the apartment many years ago.  It contains toys, pictures, and other mementos of his youth.  She wonders what it would be like if he were to see these things again, so she tracks him down and arranges for him to discover his tin box in a phone booth.  He's overjoyed and shaken from his life's sadness, and it hits her - she can step into other people's lives in secret and make them happy.So she sets out to help those around her.  The lonely woman downstairs who misses her husband, the lovestruck man who hangs out at her cafe, the mousy girl working behind the counter, the frustrated artist downstairs, the man in the Metro who collects torn pictures people throw away.My favorite is her father, who's given up on life since his wife died and who lives alone as a recluse for the most part.  Amélie steals his garden gnome and gives it to a stewardess friend, who takes it around the world with her and mails him pictures of the gnome having a good time everywhere. It shakes him up and he decides to travel to all the places he's wanted to visit but never had the nerve to do alone.But Amélie hasn't taken care of her own needs, her own loneliness.  She's fallen for the young boy in the Metro who collects pictures, but she's afraid to approach him.  Amélie gives him hints she's interested, but she can't break the barriers she's put up between herself and the outside world and doesn't allow herself to embrace him.Finally, with a little help from the artist downstairs who's figured out it's Amélie who's secretly been behind all these 'miracles,' she rushes to the young man as he's seeking her out too and they fall in love and seemingly live happily ever after.It's a love story about two lonely people finding each other, but it has a humorous slant to it.  Amélie is an impish character with bright eyes and a cheerful smile who goes through life trying to find the best in everything. Her boyfriend is also a romantic as he searches for the clue to the mystery of the man in the photos he puts together.  The film is well done and has some interesting features in the cinematography that border on surreal.  Pictures talking to people, cats with funny expressions, the lamp talking to the picture frame, people coming out of nowhere and making comments.  It's sort of like what she imagines not what's really happening, and it adds to the delightful aura of this most excellent film.Definitely one of the best films that's come out in awhile.",9,0,2,24 September 2003
Munich," The morality of assassins killing assassins
","This film is Steven Spielberg's take on the moral dilemma faced by assassins killing for the sake of their country's morale. If the protagonist was played by a better actor, it might have worked, but the film lacks spark and drags on much too long.Avner, played by Eric Bana (The Hulk), is a Mossad agent who quits to head a secret unit of assassins being sent to Europe to hunt down the people responsible for the killings of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Avner's motives for joining the unit are vague. He appears to passively accept his assignment and doesn't express much enthusiasm for revenge, so when he later begins feeling guilty about the killings, it's hard to understand where this emotion comes from. Bana has to carry the movie to make it work and he's just overwhelmed by better actors playing supporting roles.Michael Lonsdale and Mathieu Amalric are memorable as the father/son combination heading a group of free-lance agents operating out of Paris. Geoffrey Rush is excellent as Avner's Israeli handler. Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, appears as one of the Israeli assassins. Ciarán Hinds also turns in a fine performance as another one of the assassins.'Munich' is not one of Spielberg's best efforts. Usually, he draws the viewer into his films by way of emotional attachment to the characters, but with the lead player being a bit of a cypher, it just doesn't work. Still, it's entertaining and worth watching.",7,2,3,7 November 2006
Gangs of New York," Strong cast, weak story.
","For all its pedigree, 'Gangs of New York' fails to deliver as a movie. Martin Scorcese delivers a sweeping epic of mid-nineteenth century New York, but the film lacks the kind of depth needed to hold the audience's attention for the nearly three hours of running time it takes to unfold.Daniel Day Lewis plays William Cutting (Bill the Butcher), the leader of a gang of nativists opposed to the immigrants flooding into the city. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, the son of an Irish immigrant leader who is killed by Bill in the opening scene during a street battle. Cameron Diaz plays a pickpocket who was rescued off the streets by Bill as a child and who falls in love with Vallon.Scorcese sets the stage and connects all the dots, but the movie just lacks heart.  As an action movie, where Vallon avenges his father's death, it doesn't work.  One, it takes way too long for Vallon to get his revenge, and two, Daniel Day Lewis is by far the most interesting character in the film.  You don't savor his death the way you would most bad guys in his position, because the hero, as played by DiCaprio, is really rather bland.  Where Lewis is charismatic, DiCaprio just floats through the film and doesn't engender the kind of attachment his counterpart does.  Diaz is introduced into the mix just to satisfy the obligatory love interest.As a sweeping epic, the film is kind of interesting in that this period of American history is foreign to most of us.  But it lacks the grandeur of a great film.  The sets are pretty flimsy and the photography not that spectacular - not up to the standards he set in 'Goodfellas.'   In some ways, it reminded me of those cheap Sixties gladiator movies shot over in Yugoslavia.  There are some memorable scenes, but not enough to fill up 2 hours and 47 minutes.  Scorcese could have easily edited this down to two hours and still made a decent movie.Worth watching for Daniel Day Lewis' performance and for the fact that it's Scorcese, but all in all, it's really not a very good movie.",6,0,0,7 July 2003
Windtalkers," John Woo's homage to the Navajo windtalkers of WWII.
","This is a fine movie about heroism on the battlefield.  Directed by John Woo, the master of Hong Kong action films, it takes place during World War II, mostly involving the battle to take the island of Saipan.
The director takes an interesting angle, basing the story around the Navajo radio operators who used their native language and code to help the Marines coordinate their attacks without the Japanese being able to listen in. Windtalkers, that's what they were called.Nicholas Cage turns in a surprisingly good performance as a gung-ho Marine sergeant assigned to protect one of the Navajos.  Because of the danger of the code being broken were one of the radiomen to be caught alive, it's his job to kill his man rather than let him be captured.I found some similarities to another recent war film, 'Saving Private Ryan,' however, with some important differences.  John Woo embraces the culture of the warrior, while Steven Spielberg is obviously repulsed by violence.  John Woo's films always have a strong sense of honor among men in conflict - the heroes live and die by a code.  'Private Ryan' had a cynical edge to it - the men acted bravely but they questioned why they were there.The director treats the Navajo culture reverently in this film.  It is obvious that he has deep respect for his subject matter.  The opening shot of a bus full of recruits leaving the reservation and the ending where Ben Yahzee, the radioman, honors his sergeant in a religious ceremony with his son present are both touching.There's a lot of violence in this film, as you would expect from John Woo, and that might turn some people off.  But it's necessary to chronicle the battles, and the director isn't the type to turn his eye  from it.  He doesn't glorify war, but he makes sure the depiction is realistic enough to highlight the heroism of the men.A tad too long - they could have cut about fifteen minutes out without hurting the flow - but still a pretty good movie.",7,0,2,3 September 2003
Contact," Good story muddled by side issues.
","This movie is generally good entertainment but it bogs down with too many side issues that detract from the main story.  I would have preferred a pure scientific approach:  Scientist discovers sounds from outer space contain a hidden message, she decodes the message and builds a transporter from blueprints provided by the aliens, then travels to meet them.  If the movie had kept to that central premise, it would have been more entertaining.But it gets bogged down with issues of religion and politics, and issues of Jodie Foster, the scientist and main character, relating to men in her life. A little bit of personal drama is necessary in science fiction, but in 'Contact', the writers got carried away with it.  Jodie travels through space and time, to what, meet her father and reconcile childhood issues? C'mon, give me a break.  And why was it important to cast religious figures in such a negative, oppressive way?  What did that have to do with the story being told?I liked the movie but it could have been a whole lot better.",6,2,5,19 February 2003
