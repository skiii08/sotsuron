Casablanca," Social and Emotional Relevance
","Casablanca has long been referred to as one of 'The greatest movies of all time.' With the help of an awe-inspiring cast, this film directed by Michael Curtiz really strikes a chord in the hearts of the American people. In my opinion, this is for two reasons; its social relevance and emotional, relatable characters.Casablanca was filmed during a period of political indecision. At this time, America was struggling in its decision to enter WWII, and I believe it was Warner Bros. intention to stir the American public to action. Rick's slow build up to Ilsa's reluctant hero is a strong representation of America's decision to uphold those virtues our country holds dear: Courage, justice, and sacrifice. This rings especially true in today's post 9/11 society, which, like the attack on Pearl Harbor, ignited our decision to enter the war.It is easy for people to see pieces of themselves reflected in the emotional struggle of Rick and Ilsa. I believe most men can relate to the stoic, jaded, yet innately sensitive rogue that Humphrey Bogart portrays. Likewise, Ingrid Bergman represents a noble woman of conviction, who gives her whole heart to those she loves. I cannot think of another actor in the same era who could deliver the level of performance displayed by Ingrid Bergman. Everyone who has ever loved and lost feels the tear she sheds during 'As time goes by'. The sacrificial love of Rick and Ilsa is that of which any romantic would claim to aspire to.Overall, I do not find it surprising that Casablanca is movie that has stood the test of time, and it is my belief that its popularity will never die.",9,1,2,27 September 2011
