First Man," Good movie...wrong actors
","First man, the biopic of Neil Amstrong. It was a good movie, the space scenes were stunning but nothing groundbreaking. The story mainly focuses on the personal life of Neil Armstrong. The movie wants to show you things from his perspective.The movie had its moments, on the whole could have been shorter, it spends too much time focusing on Ryan Gosling staring into space.This brings me on nicely to the actors, i am not a fan of Ryan Gosling, he has the same impression on his face no matter what role he plays, Clare Foy was strictly ok. This film would have been much better if it had better actors in the lead roles. Conclusion, worth a watch.",6,1,3,15 October 2018
Rocketman," REGGIE AKA ELTON
","A biopic on Elton John but in the form of a musical. Taron Edgarton plays Elton John and plays the character very well.It's a good movie, however my reason for giving it a 5 is that all these movies about musicians and bands follow the same path, family life which is generally rubbish, how they are found, rise to fame, going wild, some sort of calamity generally involving drink and drugs and a manipulator. Finally the recovery and re-aligning friendships.Its amazing how many of these multi millionaires are depressed and suicidal, its shows that you cannot put a dollar sign on peace of mind.",5,1,3,9 August 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," The Force Is Strong With This One....
","ROGUE ONE.Lets get the show rolling, when I first heard of this movie going into production I was very nervous of how it would turn out. My concerns were around the selection of Gareth Edwards to direct the movie, his last two movies (Monsters and Godzilla) were crap in my opinion.So I guess I did not have high expectations of this movie, however after watching the movie I have give Gareth credit for making a movie that is Stars Wars at heart but follows its own path. This movie is dark, gritty and full of emotion. Its starts a bit slow but once the action kicks in it doesn't stop.Every actor played they part with gusto, very impressed.For me this was so much better than Force Awakens mainly because it was original. The Force Awakens was designed to bring new people into the Star Wars world and therefore was just a movie that fused the best parts of all previous star wars movies.Watch this one, you will not be disappointed. May the force be with you.",9,1,10,25 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Better Than last Jedi.
","I found this final installment (at least that's what we are told) better than the previous installment - the last Jedi.I appreciate the bar was set so low for me that it could only get better, and maybe thats how everyone should approach watching this movie, go with ultra low expectations and you just might enjoy it.As expected, amazing visuals, crap acting, weak storyline and to top it off the dialogue was poor. For me Star Wars died many years ago, I am no longer a die hard fan of the scifi fantasy, which itself is a shame.I say anyone who grew up with star wars should watch this movie for the sake of closure, everyone else, wait for dvd.",3,3,7,23 December 2019
Get Out," prepare to GET OUT!!!!
","This is a very clever movie, however I am not sure that I would call it horror, it more like a thriller.I am not going to give anything away, all I have to say is that the movie keeps you engaged right the way through. As a viewer you know that something is not right but you cant out your finger on it and for me when the secret was finally revealed it certainly was not what I was thinking.In terms of time the movie is just the right length, that's one of the reasons why the movie works so well. From an acting front, there is no one standout actor but ideal for the characters they play.So go right ahead watch the movie and prepare to GET OUT!",9,9,17,20 May 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," WHAT WAS THAT!!!
","STAR WARS THE LAST JEDI is what you call milking the cow when there is no more milk to give.Don't worry there are no spoilers here as there is nothing to spoil. It also goes to show how crooked the industry is when critics are giving this movie 80 - 90% if not more. This was the worst Star Wars movie I have ever seen, even the George Lucas prequels were better than this trash.Seriously, 2.5 hours of pure 100% rubbish. Never the less the movie will go on to make huge money for good old Disney and we all will buy into the hype again in 2 years time.I have nothing more to say, other than the next time i binge on Star Wars movies my binging will end with Rogue One. Not watching this again.....EVER.",1,35,57,16 December 2017
Arrival," Arrival, what a movie......or not
","Do you suffer from insomnia? if you do then I have the cure for you. Go and watch Arrival, guaranteed to put you to sleep and cure your insomnia for good.Seriously, I don't understand the scores people are giving this movie. Thought provoking maybe but a totally mind numbing experience. The movies pace is so slow. I didn't even think the movie was that clever, its a simple concept told in a complicated way.Disappointed to be honest, was expecting so much from this movie as it was coming from the director who gave us 'Prisoners' and 'Sicario'.Total let down.",3,7,16,11 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," WOW...What a movie, certainly was not expecting that.
","Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, the birth of the Justice League. This is it, DC is finally coming to the party to show Marvel that there is a new man in town.How wrong can one be, Batman Vs Superman is a total dud, the only reason I am giving is 4/10 is because I have seen worse, a lot worse. To even call it Batman Vs Superman in my opinion is a little misleading. So I can see that everyone has written their reviews of the movie, however I am going to jump straight to the point and ask the question everyone will be asking in a few weeks time 'Who is fault is for creating such a poor movie?'.For me hands down Zack Snyder, I would have thought WB would have gone for another director after Man of Steel, but no they stuck with him. I have never been a fan of Zack's movies, average at best (apart from 300...part 1 that is, part 2 is one of those movies that come into the a lot worse than this movie bracket).The movie has no sense of direction, there was nothing any actors could do to save this movie. The movie spent to much time trying to clever when it didn't need to be. I almost got the impression Zack was trying to compete with Chris Nolan and his Dark Knight Trilogy. For me it fails in every way.Finally according to IMDb the estimated budget for the movie was $250,000,000, WHAT????? What on earth was that kind of money spent on exactly? If your a fan of Batman and Superman then stick to Chris Nolan's trilogy for the Dark Knight and the Superman movies from the 80's as they were much better.PS: Wonder Woman, Why put here in the movie if she is to serve no purpose.",4,2,4,26 March 2016
