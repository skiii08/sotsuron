E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," A classic never gets old.
","Just watched it again after many years, and it's timeless. The story, the cast, the direction, and that musical score. Absolutely perfect!",10,3,4,25 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I absolutely loved this movie
","So I will keep this short and no spoilers. The movie was excellent. It had a good story. Very emotional. Definitely the best of the new trilogy. I liked all 3, but I liked 7 and 9 the best. All the people around me in the theater seemed to really like it too. Can't wait for the next saga. Keep them coming Disney.",10,3,13,20 December 2019
