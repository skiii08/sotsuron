Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pain beyond belief
","If you see this movie, even with the lowest expectation, you'll still be deceived. This is how bad it is.With one liners like : 'I didn't did it' and a bland scenario without any worthwhile dialogue, it's a miracle your brain can survive the dumb trip.From every perspective this is such a failure. Soundtrack is mediocre, 3d effects are over the top jammed pack and filled with useless stuff, the scenario plays on the level of a 10 years old perception of good vs evil, dialogues are dumb, fight scenes aren't building up to a climax and are like circus presentations,the entire star wars universe now dresses like it's Halloween, it goes on and on.What this reveals is that it's quite possible that it wasn't Lucas that was responsible for the quality of the first Trilogy.",1,2,7,26 March 2012
Star Trek," Good stuff
","I admit I am a huge fan of Star Trek and wasn't expecting much at first, but now I have seen this movie multiple times and it just gets better.Amazing casting, non-stop action, good story (not impeccable but very good), amazing camera work and post production work. Nice soundtrack as well, nothing like a classical masterpiece, but effective, especially in the concluding generic where it superposes the new and old themes in counterpoint.Overall I don't understand old fans having a grudge against this more action oriented movie, that's what a star trek movie should be; leave the holodeck pool parties for the series. They've brought Star Trek back big-time, just when we thought it was going to fade away.",10,4,7,31 December 2011
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 4th Best after the Original Trilogy (doesn't mean it's good)
","Rogue One is a better movie than The Force Awakens, but not by much.While The Force Awaken felt like a bad remake of A New Hope, it never felt like it belonged in the same universe, until perhaps the moment when Mark Hamil makes an appearance in a scene that couldn't be more underwhelming. It tried too much to please fans of the original trilogy, it took no risk and everything about it felt artificial and 'forced'.Where The Force Awaken failed Rogue One succeed. It fits naturally with the original trilogy and build upon it.It is not a perfect movie by any means. It follows the same blockbuster simplistic recipe that Hollywood can't seem to avoid since the 1990s. The story arc is as uni-dimensional as you can expect, but at least it's not completely stupid.At this point Star Wars movies are as kitsch as something can possibly be. An overabundance of references to the original movies almost ruin the entire experience. We can only hope for more original and unique movies in the future in the same universe.Once again potential romance is underdeveloped, but you can only do so much when the main goal is to squeeze as much action in there as possible. The action is however the movie strong point.In all, it's a good but small step forward. In my opinion it's the best since the original trilogy, but it still lacks 'something'. Characters are underdeveloped if not unnecessary. Thankfully it also brings something that 'feels' new and that we haven't seen since the original trilogy... Coherence (unbelievable, right?).Concerning the music, sadly, the few new musical themes are not memorable and follow very conventional harmonic structures. A truly talented composer like Jerry Goldsmith would have done miracles with that visual material.Visuals are as stunning as you can expect with a budget of that magnitude. Sometimes I wish that the director would take few seconds more to let you breath and observe. CGI actors are really a mistake; it will not age well. I would have preferred new actors with a bit of visual trickery.Overall I'm still looking much more forward to the following movie by this director if the scenario is more daring.I'm going to conclude this review by saying that I think it's time for something completely new. Movies shouldn't only be an industry concerned only by profit, they should try to be be art. We need more diverse and audacious science-fiction projects, even if it stays in the same universe.Is Disney going to take more risk in the future, when it has made profit on their initial investment in the franchise? We can only 'hope' so.",5,0,4,18 December 2016
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Huge improvement, from horrible to mediocre
","Previous movies were a complete waste of talent and totally ruined the story. But by separating the last novel in 2 movies, they now have the chance to mess up twice as more scenes.While a few of the scenes are somewhat true to the book (explaining my 4 rating), the rest feels cheap. Why remove the drama? When HP is denied the sword at the beginning, why does he stay with a bland stare instead of getting angry and defying the Minister like in the book? Was that too complicated? Like: - 'Ok now you will have to act aggressively' - 'act aggessrilevy? never heard of it, can I please just look at the wall there?' That is a Huge change in his personality: In the book he has courage and can stand on his feet, in this movie he has a blank look more often than not, and dresses like a college geek. A sweatshirt? WTFThe sames goes for the initial scene, they do not even mention it's happening at the Malfoy's manor and why. Hell the first 30 minutes of the movie is like they tried to remake the book without words and with the actors expressing the least emotions as possible. The entire production falls apart. The scene in the Dursley's house feels like a bad theatre production.And gosh the music, who's fault is it, the composer or the lousy director? I have a feeling it's more the director.This movie series will all have to be redone properly.",4,2,6,21 November 2010
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Not as Good as it Could Have Been
","The premise is exciting, the cast is interesting, the scenery is great. But somehow it doesn't hold together really well, or to say differently: it's not better than the Harry Potter movies.It will be a good TV movie for children to watch, but it's never going to be remembered as great cinema.It suffers from the same 'dryness' as the Harry Potter series. Director David Yates simply has difficulty transmitting the magical world atmosphere in his adaptation of J.K. Rowling's material. Some nice CGI will not make up for conventional editing.The biggest flaw is the very limited and barely functional usage of music. For long period of times there is no music at all, and if one thing is important in a movie about magic, it's music. It's just stack on under some scenes in a cheap fashion. Then there is the music itself, that after recycling the Harry Potter theme in the intro disappear into the realm of unimportant art forms. It's just a few orchestral effects here and there, no memorable themes.David Yates doesn't seem to understand that music is just as important as the images.In short: The direction in general is way too conventional for a movie about magic. All the costume, set designers and actors did an great job with what they had.Just wished it had been better.",7,0,4,21 November 2016
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Horrible soundtrack ruins movie
","Well this is a deception: Not even 10 minutes in and you have already been bombarded with all the musical themes of Lord of the Ring - unchanged, not re-harmonized and not re-orchestrated either. From that point on I thought to myself 'can they really be that cheap?'. Are they in it only for the money? This is a different movie after all, shouldn't it deserve it's own soundtrack considering we're going to be feed 9 hours of that stuff...More comments about the music: The soundtrack here is lame, even by the low standards of the movie industry. How about a chord inversion from time to time? The only new theme here is just bad and lacks originality. The rest is taken from Lord of the Ring, it's not even modulated (a tone below would have been appropriate for a prelude, along with an inversion of the harmonic polarities or a modulation to the relative modes) nor transformed slightly. The orchestration is just as rudimentary, a if out of a 75 musicians orchestra the composer, with all his energy, is only able to achieve a total of 4 or 5 colours.We get it, a minor third and a fourth, 4 horns in unison, V-VII-I in minor; it's all it takes to get out the cash out of the musically-uncultured customer. Where is the sophistication? Why is there no 'Hobbit themes'?General comments: So yeah, the music ruined it for me, if you wish to get a review about the 'amazing script' (some even dare call this a masterpiece) please read the following or preceding reviews.Frankly, it's still Jackson's fault, it's the usual mistake 'good' directors will make - to take the popular named music composer, where the really great directors like Paul Thomas Anderson will have a real control over the final result (or perhaps the term is critical judgment).For me it's nothing more than what you can expect from the trailers. Too much CGI, scenes that are twice too long, but a nice cinematography - the later which justify a 6.Overall: This movie cannot stand on it's own and relies way too much on the Lord of the Ring success.",4,5,18,18 December 2012
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Return of the Prequels (it's that bad)
","Lazy Script, Kitsch Festival, Wasted Potential, Under-developped Characters, Bad Humor:
What have I just seen? Is that really the best you can do Disney?This is so bad. How about you get real script writers instead of your rich talentless friends that have the imagination of a space cow?Is selling toys the only thing you care about?I mean we're in prequel territory here: Starts with a meaningless space battle we couldn't care less about, a bad guy that has absolutely no backstory, lame jokes, WTF?!Wow, just wow. Next time you want a Star Wars story that doesn't suck ask me, it's going to be cheaper and be interesting. Like freaking Luke Skywalker is going to actually do something. There is no words to express how disappointed I am.Way to kill the franchise. You can't dumb down Star Wars more than that. Anyway it's not worth it anymore.Even the way the music is used is just to buy our nostalgia. 
Cheap scam, now we can't undo this.Never even going to bother again watching another Star Wars movie.",2,0,0,19 December 2017
Alice in Wonderland," We must ask ourselves some important questions about our 'entertainment industry'
","Yes Hollywood, we know, everything is possible now with CGI, they do not impress us anymore.So how about you actually get good writers and craft a good scenario? Or at the very least something that is not intellectually retarded.How about you stop hiring your Hollywood friends to do the awful music and get some real contemporary composers with actual talent for music writing.How about you hire some good actors instead of the most popular 'stars' in tabloids.Anyone else sick of this Hollywood BS? Real talent exist but the true artists can't make a living while hundreds of millions are spent on those losers at Hollywood because they are 'part of the click'.I guess the problem is with the public, are you dumb enough to actually enjoy this? Was your brain sufficiently retarded by the lack of reading books to find a movie like this half-entertaining? Gosh I can't believe people can't notice they are gradually dumbed down by the mass media.2 stars (on 10) for the quality of the 3d rendering which must have taken a lot of cpu and ram. 0 stars for the rest.",2,9,17,14 March 2010
The Artist," This is damn good
","In a time where millions are spent developing stupid '3d' televisions and equipment to films in '3d' these guys come around and steal the show with a black and white and mute film. Some people are in for a cultural shock, others simply won't get it. Isn't the message clear? Technology should be to the service of brilliant scenarios, directing and music. Overall this movie gave me hope that serious art will eventually reach the mass and we will leave behind our current era of superficiality. From a certain point of view, this movie brings post-modern art to the movie-watching masses. Being in black and white and the re-contextualization of the thematic elements makes it more than a simple homage. I am unsure if it's been done this successfully before; while Postmodernism has proliferated in contemporary music and art for a good 30-40 years now, in cinema it has largely been avoided,for commercial reasons. It is simple and charming, far from pretentious, slightly contemporary in its presentation, and certainly deserve its awards.Brilliant acting too by the way. I don't need to say more, just go see for yourself.",10,9,15,26 February 2012
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," 20% of a great story, with mostly bad actors
","The story explored in the Movie is not even 20% of the 640 pages book and the true complexity of the story.Hollywood must think it's audience are mostly retarded; and by looking at the 7.7 mark, I guess most of them are.Most actors are bad beside Snape and Moody. Harry look like a nice choir boy while in the book he has a different personality.Well I'm glad I switched to the books, it's so much better.The movie needed to be over 180 minutes to render the story correctly.That said, the camera man did a descent job. But Hollywood has to stop with the cheese.",1,4,7,10 August 2008
There Will Be Blood," The Revelation
","There Will be Blood is quite an achievement.It is intellectually charged however, and it's normal that people who have no interest in psychology and philosophy will fail to appreciate it.The climatic ending between Paul Dano and Daniel Day-Lewis is unparalleled in dramatic intensity ('I'm the third revelation!').It brings forth the deepest existential questions that have taken hold of man-kind and their ultimate resolution, in blood:'I am finished.'It is mature, serious, perfectly mastered and powerfully acted drama. It is accompanied by a contemporary music orchestral score which imitates the 1960s style of Ligeti, Xenakis and Penderecki pretty well.Generally well composed, tonal music also comes at the appropriate moment in the movie.Just do not expect another action western movie, this is way above the rest.",10,2,3,16 March 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Ultimate Kitsch
","To say it was better than the Star Wars prequels isn't saying much. The prequels were a mess in all aspects.This time Disney plays it safe, too safe. It becomes predictable, from the scenario plagiarized on the first Star Wars movie to every scenes of somewhat emotional signification dipped in the sauce of John Williams old themes. It becomes a well made recipe with the overall artistic depth apparently way down on the priority list.To say it was a bad movie would be dishonest however. After all without deviating from conventional structures that have been proved to work it is hard to miss the target audience, which at times seems to be more considered as a consumer.To put it more bluntly, the new Star Wars is the greatest creation of kitsch ever made. It will please millions with it's unparallelled will to please on an emotional level and lack of substance on a deeper artistic level.The movie starts really well, with some nods to the old movies. These starts to saturate the movie as we get nearer to the end, where instead of upping the scenario up a notch and giving us something really new it all becomes terribly predictable. It's as if the last half of the scenario has been written by the marketing department. This disappointment is somewhat saved by the charisma of actress Daisy Ridley.Positively, it leaves room for a potentially very good sequel and ruins little on the way. The new characters are welcomed additions. Perhaps because of my low expectations I enjoyed it even if I would have liked something more daring.People will like it because it pulls the right string; and after all the suffering we had to endure from the lousy prequels we are tempted to rate this movie above what it truly deserves. I feel 7 on 10 is accurate in that regard.Except that one last thing... Spoiler Alert: Why kill Han Solo in such a lousy way? Han Solo, if he were to die, should have been as a hero, saving lives, doing something daring and succeeding but failing at saving himself. His death scene was lame and cheap. Considering he's a major character then 1 more point has to be removed from my score therefore I'm gonna rate it a 6. I don't think it's a movie you will want to watch over and over like the old ones principally because of mistakes like the last scene of Solo.",4,2,7,20 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Best Harry Potter movie by far, but has some flaws.
","They should redo the other movies according to the standards of this last one. This is almost the best we (fans of the book story) could have hoped for.It is sad that they decided to cut the dialog of the showdown between Harry Potter and Voldemort, that was the most important bit of text of the 7 books and it would have made the ending a more satisfying one.They removed some books chapters but overall, and FINALLY, they managed to get the tone right as well as the most important details of the story.If only the other movies would have been like this last one.Clearly, this shows the positive impact of having 1 more year of post-production. Perhaps a lesson to be learned by the money-hungry studio at Hollywood; This movie will still be good in 10 years, the others will not.The musical score is also better and more adventurous this time; amazing studio mastering on the soundtrack. The 'Hogwarts' musical theme is still as bad as before however.",1,0,4,18 July 2011
