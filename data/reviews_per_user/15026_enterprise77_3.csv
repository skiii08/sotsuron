Ford v Ferrari," Yes. See it. Enjoy it.
","Straightforward story: build race cars that can win Le Mans.
But that is only the start...you need the best driver in the business, even if he is a bit touchy now and then. Not sure the corporate obstacles were real, but I suppose the writers needed to add some conflict. Nah...1 point deduction.
Racing/testing scenes are really well done. Fast and furious, indeed.",9,1,3,19 November 2019
The Favourite," NOT a comedy
","The trailer portrays this movie as a comedy. NO!
It is angry, mean, deviant.
Yes, royal society wore wigs and powdered faces back then.
And I would accept that there might be some crazy behavior.
But to portray the entire social scene as one of continuous deviant, disgusting, angry behavior is just plain wrong. Reminds me of those 1960s movies that pushed the bounds of X-rated movies. There is absolutely nothing socially redeeming about this film. And the music...sounded more like a lone factory machine. Gads...save your money.",1,260,490,26 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," As usual, Tarantino defaults to a bloody scene
","The movie has a unifying concept: one-time leading man and his stunt double, now faced with taking secondary roles. DiCaprio does his usual fine job as the former leading man. His scenes are masterfully credible. And Pitt does an exemplary job as the stunt double, still capable of whipping the toughest in the business. And he does deliver his lines as always...seemingly straining to say something clever, but....
And then we have our director, Mr. Tarantino. The vaunted director simply cannot deliver a movie without bloody, loud, persistent blood and noise. His core skill seems to be the easiest for any director...just slash, shout, shoot, and bleed. No thank you.",6,6,9,12 August 2019
