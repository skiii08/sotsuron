Catch Me If You Can," Very cool
","I just saw this movie in its first public screening at the LA Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. Going in I did not know what to expect, mostly because of the fact that Spielberg directed and because of the presence of a former distaste in the form of Leonardo DiCaprio. I have to say I was very surprised at the finished product which was very cool, very well done, witty, and just an all around good movie. I have not seen a biography film done so well since, well I guess since I first saw The Passion of Joan of Arc. DiCaprio appears to be back on the top of his game. Hanks... is Hanks. I love Hanks so I can't say anything bad about him. And of course, Christopher Walken in the role of the Frank Abagnale, Sr. There is a glimmer of Captain Koons, his cameo in Pulp Fiction, in his character in this movie, although he is very much more fun, and crime, loving. There is little suspense thriller or action in this movie, but it is more than made up for with the depth that Spielberg achieved in his characters as well as in the drama. A very representative scene of these characters is when Frank, Jr. has been caught posing as a substitute and teaching his English class at his new high school for a week before he is figured out. His parents are both brought in to the principals office and informed of his behavior as he is forced to sit outside the office and watch the proceedings. When his parent finally emerge they have grave looks on their faces as they escort him out. The mother exits frame as Frank, Sr. walks beside his son looking down condescendingly. It appears that Frank, Jr. is busted. Then out of nowhere Frank, Sr. pulls this jovial smile and the tension is released. Frank, Sr. is proud of his son's accomplishment. A very interesting relationship operates between the two for the entire movie along these lines. In addition to the screening, Christopher Walken was there for a little Q&A afterwards. Weird dude. Funny, but weird.",8,0,0,14 December 2002
