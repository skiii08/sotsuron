It," Not bad at all really
",From watching the original IT by Steven king. This again for shows that today's movie making mainly goes on deep fx rather than good acting and back story. Still worth watching,5,0,2,6 November 2018
Bird Box," Another movie speople made a big fuss about.
","Hi guys there has been so much hype about this movie online over the Xmas time, but to be fair noone would have given this a 3 star if Sandra bullock was not in it. The story was slow and predictable. All these so called unanswered questions about the post apocalyptic Netflix movie. The main reason the people with mental illness would not have been affected was as most would know it's down to the way the brain makes connections between the ego and super-ego that determines right from wrong in the Brian. That is out of balance in these people. But the creatures have the influence to chance that in normal people.. that is my take. Not worth much to see honestly. Not worth the fuss",5,0,1,2 January 2019
