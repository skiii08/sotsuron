Black Swan," Pointless and bland
","Well, before I actually saw the movie I had been reading lots of positive references so I had considered it a movie worth watching. After I have seen it I was not merely disappointed but also rather depressed. The whole movie was something like a silent picture: You can watch it, though you can't quite understand what the creators want you to think of it.In the matter of fact, it is exactly the kind of movie that seems to be a perfect artistic movie - it contains epic themes like ballet and schizophrenia, depressive and negative view on life and world and a charming bad-ass with deviations. Sadly I found it so artistic that it was more likely boring and bland and the main so-called bad-ass was awfully irritating me the whole movie because of the actor and his insufficient ability to represent the character on higher level than a high school play.However, what disappointed me the most was probably the end of the movie. I won't write any spoilers here but just for you to know - a good movie shouldn't end up like this, that end indicates that the director didn't know what to do with the main character and therefore he chose the easiest way to end it. And it also made the whole movie pointless and useless to watch.It's just my opinion but I consider a great movie a movie, which I'm capable of watching more than once and I still enjoy it. And I certainly wouldn't watch THAT movie more than once.These 4 stars belong to Natalie Portman only, for her performance is just brilliant.",4,7,11,30 October 2011
Twilight," I thought a vampire was supposed to be the beast - NOT the beauty...
","I get it, vampires are popular and dangerous and I can understand somebody just feels an attraction to them but - Come on! These are not vampires! I think Meyer mixed them up with superheroes or mutants or something like that. A vampire is supposed to be a beast, to be a creature of the darkness - not a walking lightning bug.I like vampire stories and I am not against these 'love stories' between a vampire and a human, I'm loyal when it comes to that. I just can't deny that these stories are popular nowadays and i won't waste my energy doing it. But for me vampires stay ugly and evil creatures - like Dracula and Nosferatu. Well, I suppose I could go on with good-looking vampires - why not? And these supernatural gifts are not that bad to get on with. But shining in the sunlight?! Oh, come on, they are supposed to burn down to dust - I think I just can't forgive the writer who created the story that one. She turned vampires into light bulbs.Well, I think it is not that bad movie even though I'm certainly not a fan and I don't think I will ever watch it again but I guess it could be quite a lovably and entertaining movie if you're 14 or so. For me, it was kind of boring - not mentioning Pattinson's horrible acting performance and really stupid jokes. After all, you know exactly what is going to happen at the end of the movie all the way from the first minute of it.",4,2,6,30 October 2011
Get Him to the Greek," So crazy that it was almost awesome...
","Well, if you're going to watch that movie prepare yourself for following: The first 5-10 minutes of the film - you will watch it in silence with your mouth open. Somewhen in the next 5 minutes - you'll finally find out how to speak again and think 'what the f***k is THAT' During the following 10 minutes - you'll be to stunned to turn the movie off and leave it that way. The next 5 minutes - after you realize that you are actually watching a movie and NOT some kind of spoken dictionary of vulgar words, you'll get curious what other stupidity is going to happen in the next few minutes. The following 20 minutes - your curiosity will turn to silent amusement. The next 5 minutes - you'll finally shut your mouth up and you'll be wondering about Russell Brand's sanity for the rest of the movie. The last few minutes of the movie - you'll be laughing so hard your chest will be in permanent pain for the next two hours.I believe that nothing more needs to be written =)",7,3,6,29 October 2011
