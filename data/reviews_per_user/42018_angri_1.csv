The Blair Witch Project," Better than all those pseudo-teen slasher movies.
","There was alot of hype about this movie within the last few weeks, and it probably weakened the movies impact.Regardless, the filmmakers went back to what really frights you, rather than CGI style which tends to be the trend these days. Rather than showering a movie with played out graphical special effects or simple things jumping out and queued music to scare you, they go straight to what counts. The movie uses a more psychological way to frighten you, it puts you in the place of the charectors and lets you think for yourself. The movie does not spoil itself and take part in the trendy slashing-blood-everywhere films that are around today. Although lots of suburbanite kids will be saddened at the absence of massive gore and that it's not a large hollywood spectacle with a giant 20 track soundtrack, MTV special and some jennifer love hewitt charector. This movie sticks to the basics, while the ending might anger some, it sure leaves alot to wonder about in your head. I'm sure some people will walk away thinking of the ending, and what happened... Rather than eye-candy, this movie is true substance.",Null,1,1,30 July 1999
