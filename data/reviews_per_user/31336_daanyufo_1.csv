Black Swan," 7/10
","OK, i gotta say few things about this movie, which is assumed to be some kind of big psychological thriller. i love that kind of movies (memento, the machinist, shutter island, mystic river, the prestige...) , but black swan is way too over rated, and actually became 'famous' mostly because of good cast and lesbian scene between lovely Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman- that scene is definitely one of the most important things why is this movie so 'big' and controversial.in my opinion, that is totally lame. i am not saying that film is not worth watching, but it is definitely over rated and not that good as people are talking about it... this is one of these movies that have big promotion, big stars, so people are expecting (too) much, and in the end many of them are disappointed (as me)... 7/10",7,0,0,15 March 2011
