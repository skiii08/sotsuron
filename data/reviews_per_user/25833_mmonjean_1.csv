Marie Antoinette," a wonderfully bright and fine movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I have only positive things to say about this little 'chef-d'oeuvre'. I want to greet the actors' performance who render with panache all the emotion necessary to understand how the historical characters changed and developed until their final accomplishment. Thanks for them having succeed in inspiring what still miss today to Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette in the eyes of (too)many french people : their human side.It brilliantly shows an American perspective of French Royalty upon that turbulent period that took place a couple of years after Marie-Antoinette marrying the French Dauphin. Although splendid, I admit that this film is not really right as far as the political crisis at that time is concerned. And yet, this cliché about french revolution being particularly violent is and will unfortunately remain even in many french people's mind. However, i advice you not to see it especially for the historical perspective but rather for its sumptuous 'decors' as the marvellous 'château de Versailles'.This film is the perfect entertainment and you will be interested in french history after seeing it, i promise you! If you want to read something interesting, try to get Marie-Antoinette correspondence, especially the letters to her mother, it is really comic and interesting! Try also to find out a almost positive biography of Louis XVI as Jean-Christian Petitfils's Louis XVI and you'll be surprised by what you'll read. Marie-Antoinette, definitively a film to see and see again!!!!",10,6,19,5 June 2006
