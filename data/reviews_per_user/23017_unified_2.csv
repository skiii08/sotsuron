Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Not As Good As The First
","I have to say that this movie is definitely not as good as the first and, if I hadn't seen vol. 1, I would have found this movie completely unwatchable. There were simply too many long sequences of nothing happening at all, especially the driving scenes. I am one who doesn't like flashbacks, but I found that these were the most interesting pieces of the movie. The fight scenes, though enjoyable, were too short. One fight scene in particular (I won't give it away), I found to be so short and so unrealistic that I felt like asking for my money back. The actors and actresses were superb with the material that was given to them, but something is missing that I just can't put my finger on.The movie is watchable, especially if you've seen volume one and want to know how it ends, but it is not as good as the first.",Null,1,4,13 October 2004
Memento," Where's the suspense?
","This movie contained the two things I hate the most in movies - narration and flashbacks.  As far as suspense is concerned, it is completely lacking. I consider a movie to be suspenseful when I'm sitting on the edge of my seat entertained and not knowing what's going to happen next.  Well, it wasn't like this with this movie.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat unentertained and not knowing how much I could take before snatching the movie out of my DVD player in anger.  Since I already knew what was going to happen in the end (I mean, really), it was a complete waste of time.",1,21,43,15 March 2002
