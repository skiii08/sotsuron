50 First Dates," Not a bad movie for Valentine's Day
","Adam Sandler does his best to make this an entertaining movie.  It works for the most part if one is looking for a mediocre romantic comedy.  I saw the movie on Valentine's Day and the theater was packed with young couples hoping to enjoy a romantic, 'cute' movie.  There were a few scenes that just didn't jive with the overall sentiment of the movie.  But Sandler seems to always throw one or two lame, gross displays of simpleton humor into his movies.  So there ya go.  5/10",5,0,0,15 February 2004
Casablanca," My all time favorite movie
","The best movie of all time.  Romance, intrigue, mystery, and classic movie lines that have lasted over 60 years.  Thankfully kept in black and white 'Casablanca' has all the right pieces in all the right places.  Absolutely my #1 movie on my list and believe me I have a short, short list.  Most of the modern movies are junk comparable to the fast-food lifestyle we in the U. S. have created.  Casablanca is not only a classic but has set the bar for movie-making so high that only a few movies can begin to approach it's level.  I play this game with my grown children; I ask them in 60 years what actors/actresses of today will be remembered and spoken of in high regard. NOT MANY MY FRIENDS! Who do you think will be the new classic actors of tomorrow?",10,2,3,8 June 2004
Alien," A true classic
","'Alien' set the benchmark for sci-fi movies.  With so much movie trash in the system, 'Alien' redeems the true meaning of a classic.  Mr. Scott's direction and superb decision-making makes for a wild ride that is worthy of the title, 'Classic'.",9,0,1,27 October 2003
Lost in Translation," Lame,lame,lame
",Sorry folks this ain't the movie to go see.  Not too sure what the Hollywood Foreign Press was so excited about.  It is a juvenile script following a classic formula.  I'm surprised Japan isn't more concerned about their culture playing the Martin and Lewis routine. 4/10,4,1,3,8 February 2004
The Aviator," What's the big deal?
","It was a so-so movie...but why all of the Oscar buzz? It wasn't that great of a film. I guess it has been a slow year in Hollywood and Oscar is just looking for a film that is halfway OK. But really, this movie is not Oscar worthy! I'm really tired of poor movies being produced...remakes galore!! Has the movie industry run out of creative people? Anyway, Leo seems to do better when he is portraying biographic figures. And the casting for the supposed 'look alike' stars was annoying! I know you can't really find another Flynn or Hepburn but I found their characters really distracting. I just wonder if there wouldn't have been a better way to deal with Hughes private life? 6/10",6,6,12,30 January 2005
Big Fish," The 'lure' of Big Fish
","Which came first?  Is it the size of the fish or the size of the pond? I guess in this case size does matter. Since I'm kind of a perch in the game of life, I can only imagine how the size of my pond would affect my outlook. Great movie.  8/10.",8,0,0,20 January 2004
Jack Reacher," Worth the price of admission
","I never read the book (s) so I can't write about how closely the movie followed the author's original work. My review is strictly from an entertainment POV. I enjoyed the movie and will recommend it to friends. As a movie 'snob' I am a harsh movie critic and believe most of the movies today are just junk formula movies or remakes of remakes. So I would tend to think the Jack Reacher character could be a fresh addition to the current movie market. Unfortunately, I think Cruise should have produced this movie and not played the lead role. Like Liam N., Tom C. Is getting too old for these types of roles. Additionally, Cruise does not portray this character with enough intensity and is not believable as a highly trained military expert. Of course I do have some bias since I totally enjoyed the action packed, fast paced Bourne series. In the fantasy world created by movies and books Bourne would kick Reacher's behind.",7,7,15,23 December 2012
Mystic River," great acting by Penn, convoluted plot with too many loose ends
","Great acting makes this movie.  Penn and Robbins are just great.  Bacon is well.... bacon.(but we can still play 5 degrees of separation).  I have not read the book but can only imagine that the book was much better than the movie.  I understand Eastwood wanted to do the movie because of the complexity of each character.  Duely noted.  I am sure the book clearly develops each character and clearly examines the plot. Unfortunately the plot in the movie is too convoluted and leaves too many loose ends.  As the movie fades to black we are still left wondering about Bacon's character and his marriage.  So as not to spoil the movie I will stay rather vague, but the murder plotline is really weak.  All and all a good movie (7/10).  I guess Eastwood can be forgiven for his 'Unforgiven' plot.  Penn should get an Oscar nom.",7,0,0,26 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Was it just me or where you glad this thing was over?
","Unlike other serial movies this was by far the best IMHO.  But I sure was glad that last ring hit the molten lava.  Whew, whatever you do don't buy a large soda before sitting down, this is one long adventure.  I must be honest I was getting tired of Frodo and his malingering or maybe I was just tired of Elijah Wood. Gollum hung around way too long, like a mosquito at a picnic. And what's with the spider?  I know she was in the book but it was sort of 'cheesey' in a 'Lost in Space' kind of way. 'Danger, danger Will Robinson!'  You get my drift?   BTW, Hugo, Neo called and he wants his sunglasses back!Bravo to Jackson and his wonderful direction.  8/10",8,0,1,25 December 2003
