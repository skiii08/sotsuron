The Mask," the way the mask speaks to me in july 2002
","Looking back at a film largely forgotten by the general moviegoing public years ago, I notice there is something about the mask that really represents a different style of creativity when it comes to the art of computer generated special effects. A critic of movies should take another look at this movie and notice the drastic ways the use of computer generated special effects has spiraled out of control. Films nowaday have muddled the true entertainment of special effects with lavish overproduction. When an entire city is digitally created and zoomed through with a free range 3d camera it is not the same as when 3D effects and live action play off of each other naturally. In The Mask Jim Carrey becomes a god, he can do anything he wants to do, bend the true elements of reality around him, and his insanity is brought to life with the use not even MILDLY TASTEFUL visual effects. These special effects are over the top, but they are not RIDICULOUS. Reality is getting cheapened by computer generated graphics. Any movie can have good special effects. Mortal Kombat, Annihilation had great special effects, so did Lost in Space. Those are horrible, horrible movies. Take me back to the days with movies were tasteful, subtle, subversive, extreme, calculated. Movies like Road to Perdition and the upcoming Gangs of New York are looking interesting, but still there is a flood of mainstream brainpan droppings that start sucking out your lifeforce as soon as you start to stare into their idiot void and don't stop until you're out 8.50 are contaminating the market and putrifying American cinema. Look at a movie like this, and then hope for the future.",9,0,0,28 July 2002
Men in Black II," The stuff that makes brain fat, pale and unhealthy
","It is imperative to state the damage that corporate films like MiB 2 are doing to the value of the American movie. Remember when product placement used to be slightly subtle? Remember when even horrible sequels were trying to be original? (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls is the Godfather pt. II compared to Goldmember and Men in Black 2!) Those days are gone. Buried. More and more frequently films are turning out to be manipulative commercials where characters are liscened out to hold products and recite lines like the scientist in Independence Day, smashed against the observation glass of Area 51 with a hypersensitive tentacle wrapped firmly around his throat. Plots are recycled, characters change or are completley done away with, and performances are only there to introduce the next sight gag.Thus is the case with Men in Black 2. Are you really suprised? Did you really expect it to be a good movie? In corporate bedfellow Barry Sonnenfeld's bleak, muddled and watered down remake of first film we are invited to laugh because the other idiots in the theatre are forcing themselves to. It's sad, how much forced laughter can be heard in the theaters these days. Exclamations rather than true displays of emotion, the forced choked laugh is becoming as commonplace as popcorn and projection at Cineplex.In Men in Black 2, the entire production is shoddy and cheap. It dosen't feel like a movie. It feels weak, it feels greedy, it feels insencire and rude. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones don't care if the movie is good or not, they can get off on the fact that the first film was something we had never seen before. At first I thought maybe the story had to be rushed but I am starting to understand that scripts like this one aren't rushed, there is simply no effort put into writing them. The storyline is the vehicle for Will Smith and an increasing number of strange, distant, unfunny sight gags that perplex and disturb rather than bring on belly laughs. Everything about the film sucks, and it sucks so bad that it makes me wonder if there is any saving cinema. All we see is sequels. All we are treated to is unsubtle and desperate product placement and all we can expect is more of the same unless we STOP SEEING THESE MOVIES. IF THESE FILMS MAKE MILLIONS, THEY WILL KEEP MAKING THEM! I implore moviegoers, don't bother with this film. It's a remake of the first movie, it offers nothing original and it is cheap, jumbled and nonscensical just like Austin Powers: Goldmember. I can almost guarantee that Road to Perdition, a film so far from a comedy it hasn't even learned the word, will make you laugh harder than Men in Black 2 will.Do not waste your money on this garbage.",1,7,12,28 July 2002
Signs," SPOILERS. this is for the people who have already seen the movie
","This is a review intended for the people who have already seen M. Night Shaylamans's SIGNS. If you haven't seen this film, I urge you to go out and see it. And don't continue reading this review as it will ruin the movie for you starting in the third sentence, and throughout.Signs is a somewhat misleading movie, meaning I went in expecting one thing and came out still digesting something completely different. At first I didn't like what I saw. I was perplexed and dissapointed in the scene in which the straggler Alien attacks the family, and I was pretty angry about the whole Christianity message that I got out the conclusion. 'Did someone save me?' 'Yeah, I think someone did.' Retch. Vomit. Chunks. Then I looked a little harder and realized that M. Night was trying to appeal to the two different kinds of viewing audiences. The ones that he talks about in the film. Atheists and Faithfuls. Non-believers and believers in a higher power called God. However, even if the ending was a little offputting, it did not ruin the entire film for me. However, I pretty much paid 8.50 to go see a sci-fi movie with a wicked and hopefully disturbing twist at the end. There was no twist. There was only...I don't know, a cheap self realization that the movie seemed to take on at the very end that encouraged the viewer to look at it as a specimen instead of experience it as a story. I don't really feel like trekking through the entire film again just to find all the SIGNS that M. Night slipped in there for the geeks. If for any reason I was to watch the film a second time, it would be for the performances of the actors, and the quirky dark humour that makes the film so enjoyable. The movie theatre was packed when I went to see this film opening day, and I was surprised at how much laughter resonated through the dark, air conditioned temple of celluloid. No really, I mean everyone laughed real hard during the intentionally funny parts, but there was louder laughter during the unintentionally funny parts. At least I think they were unintentional. I look at reviews written by some of the SMART, SMART reviewers and cinema buffs at Ainticoolnews.com, and I hear them writing about how much the Brazillian Birthday scene shook them and frightened them. I even remember one reviewer drawing a comparison to 9\11 footage and how Phoenix's reaction reminded him of his own. However, in the theatre, when that blurry green figure lurches onto the television screen and the soundtrack drops a painfully intentional LOUD ORCHESTRA CLUSTER OF NOISE THAT IS ENGINEERED TO MAKE YOU JUMP the entire room was filled with hysterical laughter. Strange, was it really supposed to be that funny? I thought it was. Mel Gibson is good here, real good. He's funny, sad, and shows great emotions. Those ticks of sadness that burst onto his face when the bi-section of his wife really hits home (when he is talking to M. Night and the man apologizes to him, at the dinner table near the end of the film) I really felt for his character. Rory Culkin. I like him much more than young Macauly, he's much more mature, probabley because he was bred to make those parents more money and has been in acting camp since he popped out the womb. The little girl who plays Bo is horribley adorable, but not in an annoying way in the least bit she handled the subject matter amazingly and delivered her lines better than Rory. She is genuinely sweet. Phoenix blisters with talent, nearly stealing the entire show. Everyone else is pretty much cardboard, including the director who I wasn't too impressed with as an actor, but he wrote a great punchline for himself. A friend joked that M. Night had actually captured an alien in his cabinet and decided to write a movie about it. Perhaps...he's a strange guy. You can just sort of tell. So overall, even though it didn't follow the twist ending formula to a T the way Unbreakable did...it was still good. The ending was marred by the religious message that I GUESS can be interpreted as a string of coincidence(if you're going to be that NAIVE, Signs seems to scream) but the dark humour and general creepiness of most of the first half (except for the unintentionally halarious moments where Shaylaman takes himself a bit too seriously) and worth seeing in a theatre above all other places. Chirp. Whirr. Roar. Goodbye.",Null,0,1,4 August 2002
