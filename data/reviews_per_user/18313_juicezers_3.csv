Hereditary," why is thia rated so highly?
","I agree with the negative reviews. This is a poor horror movie.
A few people say the the acting was amazing? Really Peter is shocking, his crys??
Did not find the movie scary in any sense.
It is deffinatly not original.
So dussapointed. IMDB user reviews use to be aomething I relied on. But after seeing some terrible films with high ratings and some decent films with very low ratings, I will judge for my self in future. Each to their own.",2,2,4,24 May 2020

","Watched this back on release. WOW my number 1 crime action flick of all time.
