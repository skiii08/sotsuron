Skyfall," The best Bond film?? (MAJOR spoilers)
","First of all I want to make it clear, this is a good film but I was disappointed having expected much more after the rave reviews from many of the critics. In my review, I'm going to focus on these weaknesses and let others concentrate on the strengths the film undoubtedly has.This definitely is not the best Bond film, I don't think its Daniel Craig's best Bond film either, I preferred Casino Royale. The problem is Skyfall tries too hard to be clever and includes too many elements in an attempt to please all the Bond fans.It tries to include the classic one-liners, references to earlier films in the franchise, details of Bond's background whilst re-introducing the key characters that have been missing from the two previous installments and, on top of all this, setting the stage for the future of the series. The film suffers from trying to do all of these things perhaps as a 50th anniversary tribute to itself when it would have been better to have spread these elements over at least two films.I've always felt the best Bond films had a comparatively straightforward and realistic storyline (this is why For Your Eyes Only is my favourite Roger Moore 007 film) and Skyfall avoids this by having a villain who is too far-fetched and cartoonish. Silva (Javier Bardem) is another version of The Joker from The Dark Knight. Ledger's character was a great success and the strongest part of what I felt was a mediocre film. It worked for me because I've never considered the Batman films to be taken seriously; it is part of a comic strip fictional parallel universe that allows these characters to exist without appearing out of place.Silva just doesn't belong in the tough, realistic environment that the Bond films are now striving for. He is so reminiscent of The Joker both in his mannerisms and his actions (allowing himself to be caught and then escape as part of an elaborate plan) that he becomes a distraction. It is also completely implausible that a genius who can out-smart Q and the rest of MI6 would willingly follow M and Bond to a remote Scottish country home. Why would a villain who has clearly planned everything to finest detail then act so impulsively? The resulting climax, a Straw Dogs-like siege, is a disappointment.I initially welcomed Judi Dench's departure from the series and then rolled my eyes in disappointment when her successor was revealed. I've never enjoyed her as M. She is undoubtedly an excellent actress and there is where the problem lies. Dench, rightly or wrongly, is a national treasure and it is inevitable that any act-OR chosen to play M will be making a more substantial contribution to the films. I've always felt that the character of M works best purely as a device for explaining the plot to an audience as Bond is sent off on his mission. Any further involvement whether it be additional screen time or the more personal angst and friction with Bond is both contrived and redundant. The best M was Bernard Lee, a gifted character actor who could be limited to a smaller, more effective role.Now that Ralph Fiennes, another act-OR, is M, the opportunity to address this error has probably been missed. Audiences will be expecting him to be flexing his acting muscles as much as Dench did.On a positive note, I had my doubts about the inclusion of a younger Q when it was announced but I was pleasantly surprised by Ben Whishaw's performance and I can see this continuing to work well in future films.As for the new Moneypenny, I've always regarded her to be a secretary, an administrator, she is NOT a former field agent deployed to kill the enemy.In the previous films Bond was always out of reach for Moneypenny, she knew it and so did the entire audience. How can the playful flirtatiousness work in future now that we know she's slept with him?",7,14,29,27 October 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," The greatest epic ever made
","With Lawrence of Arabia, David Lean proved beyond doubt his complete mastery of filmmaking. This is the most visually impressive and beautifully made film I have ever seen. Made on an enormous scale and meticulously directed, it dwarfs other epics and succeeds in providing a clear insight into all of the main characters which is where many epics have failed in the past where the spectacle dominates and characterisation is forgotten.It is obvious when watching this film that every single scene has been thoroughly worked out and slaved over until it has been perfected. Stanley Kubrick's films often give the same impression but Lean has managed to avoid forgetting about and ultimately dehumanising the story and characters which was Kubrick's greatest failing.Lean's task is helped considerably by the cast. In a film of this scale there is often a temptation to fill it with movie stars in order to help recoup the vast budget. Thankfully the original intention of casting Marlon Brando as T.E Lawrence and Horst Buchholz or Alain Delon as Sherif Ali was soon dismissed and the then unknown Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif were chosen, both of whom were perfect for their roles.It is hard to believe that another unknown actor, Albert Finney, actually turned down the part of Lawrence, the role of a lifetime, before it was offered to O'Toole.As great an actor as Finney undoubtedly is and despite giving a superb screen test over four days, I simply can not see him capturing the eccentricities and mystique of the enigmatic Lawrence. Finney is also too powerfully built to look a misfit in the British Army in the way the softly spoken, painfully thin O'Toole did.O'Toole has the ideal appearance for Lawrence who indeed looks and acts like a clown as one officer pointed out to him whilst performing his initial role with the army in Cairo. However once he is in the desert and has found a cause he believes in, he becomes an astonishingly beautiful figure in his elegant white robes and is a million miles away from the suffocating stiffness of the British Army.Omar Sharif as Ali provides an exotic Arabian companion to Lawrence, the two of them educating each other in the ways and customs of their respective countries. The contrast between them is emphasised by Sharif's dark hair and brown eyes and by O'Toole's blonde hair and staggeringly blue eyes.Arthur Kennedy is excellent as the cynical and often bedraggled Jackson Bentley; the journalist based on Lowell Thomas, who makes Lawrence famous around the world.Anthony Quinn is ideally cast as Auda abu Tayi, the boisterous leader of an Arab faction whose hatred of Ali's tribe is likely to explode at any moment.If there are weaknesses in the cast they will probably be found in the performances by Anthony Quayle who is slightly wooden as the compassionate Colonel Brighton and surprisingly Alec Guinness, miscast as Prince Feisal, whose make-up looks unconvincing when standing near Omar Sharif.What makes the story particularly interesting is that there is no undoubted hero but several villains. No major character comes through this film free of blame or criticism.Lawrence is indeed the shameless exhibitionist' as Jackson Bentley stated after his funeral whose arrogance leads directly to his brutal torture and sexual abuse at the hands of the Turks. Sherif Ali often seems to have more compassion for the Turks than for his fellow Arabs. Auda's interests in the Arab revolt are primarily fuelled by greed.The British Army and its subjects, perfectly portrayed by Jack Hawkins and Claude Rains are deceitful, manipulative liars looking to exploit Lawrence's achievements in Arabia. Prince Feisal is cruel in his condemnation of Lawrence at the end.The Arabs themselves are incapable of resolving their tribal differences in order to unite and gain their freedom. The Turks are brutal, bloodthirsty savages who slaughter and rape their innocent and defenceless victims.Despite the fascinating politics and excellent characterisation there are some clear weaknesses in the story. The scenes with the British Army in Cairo are poorly written particularly Lawrence's scene in the nasty, dark little room' and Lawrence's return to Headquarters after the victory in Aqaba. The scene depicting Lawrence wandering around, lost in thought as he searches for the miracle Feisal desperately needs is a tacky piece of Hollywood melodrama that is untypical of Lean.However, these occasional shortcomings are completely overshadowed by the unforgettable images that make this film stand out head and shoulders above any other.Everyone remembers Ali's entrance, appearing as a mysterious, tiny spot on the horizon but the two finest scenes in the film belong to Lawrence.The rescue of Gasim is an amazing piece of editing as the loyal Daud waits for Lawrence to return. The soundtrack is wonderful as Daud approaches the distant figure he hopes is Lawrence, the music changing with each cut to compliment the action, culminating in the spectacular shot of their two camels meeting and crossing, the only figures in a vast desert.The most remarkable scene perfectly sums up the story of Lawrence and the unsolvable mystery that surrounds him. O'Toole striding triumphantly along the top of a recently derailed train, the adoring Arabs following his shadow as El Aurens' jumps onto the next carriage and blocks out the sun creating a dramatic silhouette of an untouchable God-like figure.",Null,6,13,6 December 2003
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Boring, pointless and SICK!!
","It's difficult to know where to begin. There are so many things wrong with this film.It takes forever for the story (if you can call it that) to get going and the first half of the film mostly consists of set-pieces that Tarantino wanted to include so desperately that he apparently didn't care that they were unrelated. They resemble a scrapbook of scenes that Tarantino never tried to connect into a coherent story.Like all of Tarantino's recent films, it is far too long with drawn out or superfluous scenes and the characters of Bruce Lee, George Spahn, Randy (Kurt Russell), his wife, Janet and Marvin Schwarz were just unnecessary, irrelevant and added nothing to the film. In all, an hour could easily be cut from the film.These issues on their own are enough to seriously weaken any film but the biggest problem I had by far was with the ending where Tarantino changes history (again) and shamefully twists one of the most horrific and infamous mass murders of the last century into a climax of over-the-top slapstick gore that is played for laughs.I was appalled that such a tragic event could be trivialised and treated in such a disgusting way and it beggars belief that Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie agreed to be in this film after reading the script.Shame on them for doing so.",2,8,13,21 August 2019
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Pasolini's most notorious film
","Pier Paolo Pasolini's last film is one of the most revolting ever made. Loosely based on the Marquis de Sade's `The 120 Days of Sodom', it has everything from sexual perversion with extreme emphasis on coprophagia to torture, including cutting off tongues, slicing eye-balls, scalping and burning nipples and genitals. If this film is meant to be thought-provoking, the only thought it provoked in my mind was 'what is the point?' When a film of this nature is made, it can usually be dismissed as a cheap sado-masochistic fantasy produced merely to thrill those to whom it would appeal. In such cases any question of artistic merit would not even be considered. However, Pasolini was a serious and respected film-maker and it is difficult to believe that he would resort to this kind of material without there being at least the intention of making a serious point. Perhaps it was meant to shock it's viewers into realising the atrocities that may have occurred in the past. But, if so, was it really necessary for Pasolini to take such apparent delight in highlighting this? I see no discernible point to `Salo' but as it is a Pasolini film, it has naturally been given extra consideration. Perhaps, in this case, we should forget the name of it's director and dismiss it with all the other films of it's kind.",Null,7,13,30 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Much Ado About Nothing
","Stanley Kubrick's last film was one of the most eagerly awaited and mysterious movies ever made. Ever since 1996, film fans have been waiting for the 'master's' final film to make it to the big screen. Although, Kubrick had other projects in mind, it was obvious that with the huge gap between each film that 'Eyes Wide Shut' would be the final chapter to his career.Kubrick had stated that this was his best film and the two stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, both said that they were blown away by the film when they first saw it. The only reason I can think of that can explain this is that the three of them were involved in this project for so long that they had convinced themselves that they were making a masterpiece.Since 'Barry Lyndon (1975)', Kubrick's films have not matched the quality of his earlier masterworks and unfortunately, Kubrick has finished his career with his weakest and most obviously flawed film.After an intriguing and very stylish opening, 'Eyes Wide Shut' simply loses all it's direction. After coming home from a high-society gathering from which both Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice, have spent most the evening flirting, Alice tells her husband of a fantasy she once had about a man she saw, telling William that she would have given up everything, her marriage included, in order to fulfil that fantasy. This fairly unlikely and irrelevant anecdote, told with Alice's intention of keeping her husband from being over-confident about her marital fidelity, leads Dr. Harford on a bizarre and totally unbelievable walk through the streets of New York and into a sexual underworld where he himself has the opportunity to fulfil his own fantasies. A promising beginning to the movie disintegrates into an aimless and seemingly improvised story with many unnecessary scenes (Cruise's character seems to spend an eternity getting a costume for a mysterious and potentially dangerous sex orgy). Dr. Harford simply wanders from one weird character to another as the story becomes more ridiculous with a totally implausible explanation of it all being tacked on at the end. Also, the final piece of dialogue was probably one of the first things to have been written as it simply doesn't belong with what has happened before but seems to have been put there because it sounds clever and witty.However, this IS a Kubrick film and anyone with any interest in films should see it purely for that reason. However, many people will be disappointed because Kubrick's movies are eulogised simply because he made them, 'Jingle All the Way' would be acclaimed as a complex and thought-provoking masterpiece if Kubrick's name been attached to the credits.Stanley Kubrick was one of the greatest and most naturally gifted directors of all time but unfortunately as he became more obsessive about the making of his films he seemed to lose the ability to judge whether his projects actually had a good story.Here we have a great director working meticulously at a boring film, it's a pity he couldn't have finished on a higher note.",3,3,7,6 August 1999
