The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Not for me
","I have to say with all the hype this film was given I thought it was going to be a whole lot better than it actually was. The most interesting parts of the movie were what was shown in the previews and everything else just seemed to fill the spaces in-between. Emma Watson was great and it showed that she is diverse in her acting roles and that she could break away from forever being Hermione, but the movie as a whole was kind of boring and long-winded. It was just so disappointing overall. Yet another film where it never actually lives up to the hype.Watch it and make your own opinion but for me, this just wasn't the best",3,1,2,27 June 2013
