Howl's Moving Castle," Full of humanity
","Young girl Sofi was the owner of a hat shop. One day she encountered handsome Howl who had been being chased by a evil witch. At once she had a good impression on Howl. However the evil witch cursed her and changed her into an ugly old woman. She thought that she could not live in the home any more and left. With the help of a kind straw man, she came into Howl's moving castle. An exciting travel began.There is deep humanity in every Japanese master Miyazaki Hayao's works. To my joy, his works always are bright and uplifting. This one also is not an exception. Although I would like to see true man's show, as to animation his works are my top choice. His long time partner---Joe Hisaishi brought me wonderful music again.One of the best animation movies in 2004. 8/10",8,1,2,4 January 2006
Finding Neverland," Think like a child
","When we grow up, we cannot think like we were children. We are losing the ability of imagination. The exhausted writer James was in sagging spirits. When he met the family of widow Sylvia, he refreshed himself. Through playing with the children, he got much inspiration. Finally he wrote a well-known work.The interaction between James and the kids was the best part in the movie. Every time I laughed as if I came back my childhood. In fact from a child you can learn much. The kids can be good examples for us. They are full of imagination.The final part was unforgettable. When sick Sylvia watched the Neverland, the splendid place also touched my heart deeply. I think everyone has one's Neverland. If you really want it, it will come to you.I think that Johnny Depp was the most appropriate man for the role. His character was fully in accordance with the role. His acting was impeccable. Kate Winslet also brought us wonderful performance. As similar subject, FN was better than Peter Pan (2003), Hook (1991).One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10",9,3,3,18 August 2005
Memento," What is truth?
","Leonard Shelby's wife was murdered. He wanted to find the murderer and revenge for his wife. However unfortunately he lost his memory. Even he could not remember something happened minutes before. He had to use his way to find the murder.I was attracted immediately by the movie because of its uncommon story-telling way. Watching this movie was not an easy job. You had to think again and again to judge what was truth or not. If you take a nap while watching, maybe you will not understand fully the movie.It was a pity that Christopher Nolan did not win the Oscar award for The Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.An excellent suspense movie you should not miss. 8/10",8,0,3,21 November 2005

When he and his partner were sent to assist solving a murder case happened in Alaska, the investigation on him was still going on. His partner was a key witness on his own case. He tried to persuade his partner to give up, but failed. More head aching, he killed mistakenly his partner in an operation of hunting the killer. He covered the truth. His agony just began.Sometimes we make a mistake, and then we conceal it. It turns out to lead to bigger mistake because you have to make continually mistakes to prevent the exposure of truth. The price usually is huge.Al Pacino wonderfully played a sympathizing detective. He should have won a nominee for the academy award at least.An excellent thriller. 8/10",8,0,0,9 February 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Conscience
","Due to long conflict between Hutu and Tutsis, a big massacre began in Rwanda. This time Hutu prevailed. As the manager of a hotel, at first Paul just wanted to protect the hotel from destroying. When he learned more and more Tutsis got killed, Paul made up his mind to save Tutsis refugees as possible as he could.The whole saving process was quite thrilling. Paul and his family also experienced the test of death. The following scene was impressive. Paul persuaded his wife to take the truck, though he remained in the hotel. What a touching parting.If Paul lost his conscience that human being should own, the story would be totally different. Only conscience can make the world peaceful. If conscience always exists, the unfair phenomena will disappear from the present crazy world.Don Cheadle's performance was full of appeal. He deserved fully to be nominated for best actor (Academy award). I am not surprised if one day he wins the academy award.One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10",9,1,1,23 September 2005
Crash," Forgiveness
","Two black young men robed a white couple's car. Then more people were involved. The main content was about racial problem. In fact there were much information in the movie. Everything is not absolute. 'Bad' cop Ryan saved the woman who he insulted. 'Good' cop Hanson shot mistakenly the black young man. So everything can be changeable.In real life you need dealing with all kinds of relationships. The key is leniency. If you own it, you can get good relationship with anyone else. The movie is so thought provoking that deserves everybody to watch.The whole level of performance is high. No doubt it is the excellent screenplay that makes the film so extraordinary.Highly recommended. 9/10",9,3,9,20 September 2005
The Doors," Light your life
","When Jim Morrison was a kid, he saw a traffic accident. The painful facial expression of the injured people left him a deep impression. When he grew up, he became a popular rock singer. His passionate stage show won the heart of every fan. But old unhappy memory still confused him. He began to take drug and indulge himself. He paid a big price for it.Jim Morrison's short life was full of passion. He did what he wanted to do. I appreciated his straightforwardness very much. Life needs passion. Life without passion is colorless.I watched many movies starred by Val Kilmer. I think that this one is his best. He brought me a lively Jim Morrison. In addition to good acting, the movie also proved that he could sing well.An exciting biopicture. 7/10",7,2,3,5 January 2006
Lost in Translation," Pure friendship
","When we are in a strange environment, maybe we will feel lonely just like Bob and Charlotte. But if you can find somebody to talk, thing will be different. Bob and Charlotte came to know each other accidentally, though they arrived at Tokyo for different purpose at the same time. They were both boring of present life. The more they knew each other, the closer between them. I was glad that they had no sex relationship. If that happened, the movie would be downgraded to an ordinary movie.It had a positive ending. Although I did not know what Bob said to Charlotte, that was sure to be their new start. If you have a real friend, you will never feel lonely again. In fact it is hard for a man to keep pure friendship with a woman in reality.Sofia Coppola gave us an excellent screenplay. She deserved the academy award. Bill Murray's funny show reminded me of Ghost buster. Obviously young Scarlett Johansson had a good potential. I am sure that she will have a bright future.A well-done movie that can warm your heart. 8/10",8,4,8,17 August 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Determination
","Peaceful life in the Shire was broken by the ring with evil power. The Hobbit Frodo was forced to involve in the incident. When no one would accept the task to destroy the ring by throwing it into the volcano in Mordor, a little man stood up and said that I will do it. What an exciting moment. Although Frodo seemingly was weak, his determination was stronger than anyone else. In the other hand, maybe only his pure heart could resist the temptation of the ring. Even powerful Gandalf could not do it.So the huge task was given to the small Hobbit. However he was not alone. A nine-man-expedition formed. Their determination to protect Frodo from hurt and complete the task could not be overlooked. Even one of them was killed for that.In reality sometimes we are hesitating to make a decision. But once it is decided, you should do it firmly. No return, or gain nothing.It is the first film of TLOTR trilogy. A very good beginning that pushes you to watch the following one. 9/10",9,2,3,22 August 2005
Being John Malkovich," Being yourself
","Craig was a street puppeteer. In fact he had to rely on his wife because of his unpopular show. So he decided to look for a job. He successfully get a job in a company where located in weird seven and half floor. One day he found a hidden door by chance in his office. Due to curiosity, he crawled into the portal. What happened next surprised him a lot.If one's thought is controlled by another person, that is definitely a tragedy. If things go on like that, life is boring and meaningless. After I finished watching the imaginative movie, I felt that I am so lucky to have my own thought for everything.Excellent screenplay and satisfying performance made the movie absorbing. More importantly the comedy brought me not only laughs but food for thought.A meaningful fantasy movie. 8/10",8,0,1,4 January 2006
Collateral," Metropolitan life
","LA taxi driver Max was not satisfied with his status quo. He was planning to start his own business. One day he met a passenger Vincent who said he was a businessman. Vincent wanted to use him for the whole night. At first Max did not agree. After Vincent offered a good price, he accepted it. He just did not realize that he made a big mistake. A dangerous city game began.The film was not only a thriller but a drama for exploring the complicated relationship between city people. As I live in Shanghai (16 million population), I can identify what the movie expressed. It is the fierce competition that make cold metropolitan. Somebody fight for living. Somebody fight for good living. There are so many people in the metropolitan, but we always feel so lonely.I particularly like the far shots. They brought me strong visual impact. Of cause wonderful acting and music should not be overlooked. If Jamie Foxx did not win the best actor for Ray, he also could win the Oscar award for Collateral.A thought-provoking drama. 8/10",8,2,3,23 February 2006
American History X," Racial discrimination is crime
","Derek was a crazy racist before he was sent into the prison. His action also affected greatly his younger brother Danny. Even Danny took him as his model. But Derek got the most important lesson for him in the prison. After leaving the prison, he was not a racist anymore. Although he tried to persuade Danny to abandon racial discrimination, Danny was still killed by his black classmate.At present racial discrimination not only happens in America, it is also a headache for other countries. As advanced animal, the human being cannot live in harmony. That absolutely is shameful for the mankind. We have to learn much from the natural world. People are born to be equal, but we cannot respect each other. Only RD is eradicated, the earth is just a good place to live for the mankind.If Edward Norton won the Oscar award for this role, I will not be surprised. He also had wonderful performance in Primal fear, Fight club. He has the ability to play any role.A movie worth everybody to watch and think. 9/10",9,0,0,23 August 2005
Before Sunset," Life is not perfect
","After nine years Jesse and Celine met again, though this time was not accidental. However time that was left to them was shorter. Jesse was married and became a writer. Celine was still single and engaged in environmental protection. Their conversation showed their maturity.It looked that they led their respective good lives. In fact it was not. Celine could not help complaining her present life on the way to her home. She was regretting that she could not go for the date nine years before, though it was not her fault.Life is unpredictable. If Jesse and Celine left telephone number to each other, the story would be different. But there were not so many 'ifs' in life. You must grasp the opportunity or regretting is unavoidable.The enigma that was left in Before Sunrise provoked the interest of many people. So Before sunset was born for needs. To my surprise it still kept high quality. That should attribute to smart screenplay. Of cause the performance of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy was still impeccable. Especially Delpy showed her versatility and sang a lively song for us.One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10",9,2,4,13 October 2005
Saving Private Ryan," Cruel war
","The story happened in the Second World War. Private Ryan's three elder brothers were killed in battles. The US army decided to send Ryan back to home to alleviate his mother's pain. Captain Miller accepted the task, though he was not satisfied with it including other members. It was said that Ryan was in German-dominated-France-area. Every team member knew its hardship.The opening battle that happened in Omaha beach was fierce and unforgettable. The similar scenes also occurred in wonderful TV series Band Brothers. When Miller led seven people to execute the mission, that reminded me of The lord of the rings. Of cause the task in TLOTR was more difficult.Life is precious. However a war can easily kill many people. The war is ruthless so that you must be cold-blooded or get killed in battlefield. Peace is really what we should cherish.An excellent thought-provoking war drama. 9/10",9,14,26,21 February 2006
Good Will Hunting," Trust
","Finally I watched the long-awaiting movie. As what I expected, it did not disappoint me. Although a genius can have high IQ, high EQ can not be assured. Smart Will had serious mental problem. He could not make good use of his talent. On the contrary, he was abandoning his life. Even his friend Chuckie felt unhappy for that. What he said to Matt on the construction site just proved that their relationship was so deep. I was moved by it. I believe that it is satisfying if you have such a good friend.In fact Sean also had his unsolvable problem. Due to Sean's patience, Will began to accept him. It was the trust between them that changed their lives. Honest communication made them can overcome their respective problem in the end. Without trust, I can not imagine what our lives will become in reality. No trust, no friend. If you want to own a real friend, trust is necessary.Robin Williams deserved the academy award (the best supporting actor). Matt Damon was as good as his The Talented Mr.Ripley. Another similar excellent movie is Finding Forrester.Although it is not a masterpiece, it is absolutely worth watching. 8/10",8,0,6,3 August 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Upholding
","Although the expedition was in parts, the march was not over. Kind Frodo accepted bad Gollum without hearing the opinion of Sam. In fact without Sam, the task could not be finished. From the ending part of the first film, we could see Sam was realizing his promise.The ring began torturing Frodo. His flesh and soul suffered double strike. But he still persisted in it. That was the hardest moment for Frodo in the journey. Insisting is just the victory. So does it in reality.Although Saruman and Sauron were defeated, the dark lord Sauron still had the ability to reorganize the dark army and attack the mankind again. The peace for Middle-earth had not come yet.The hardship in the journey deepened the friendship between Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin. They endured the test, though the victory had not come yet. A friend in need is a friend indeed.As the second film of TLOTR trilogy, it is necessary and satisfying. 9/10",9,1,1,22 August 2005
The Elephant Man," Sympathy is virtue
","Disfigured man John was treated as a freak. His boss wanted to make big money by exhibiting him. The plan was opposed by the police. It raised great interest for doctor Frederick. He decided to take a look on John. The outcome really shocked him. As a sympathizing doctor, he wanted to help John. He took John away from his boss and provided a room to John. However what happened next was beyond Frederick's control.What Frederick did to John really moved my heart. Although everyone wants to be beautiful, everyone's fate is different. Mocking other unluckier people just shows ignorance. Although appearance is important in modern society, inside should be the deciding factor. Unfortunately it is not be accepted by everyone.Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt brought me unforgettable performance.An excellent drama worth everybody to watch. 9/10",9,0,1,25 January 2006
Amadeus," A genius's tragedy
","When Salieri was a child, his father opposed him to develop his interest on music. After the sudden death of his father, he can put fully his heart into music. When he grew up, he became a royal composer. He often heard people talking about Mozart's music. That raised him big interest. When he saw Mozart in an occasion, Mozart's unusual behavior surprised him a lot. As to Mozart's music, he had to admit its greatness. The more he appreciated Mozart's music, the more jealous he was. That led to fearful outcome to Mozart, then himself finally.You can hear splendid music from start to end. Of cause the plot is also absorbing. Especially the final part, Mozart gave an oral account for his work in deathbed while Salieri tried to write it down. That is the most unforgettable scene in the movie.The whole acting and producing level is high and satisfying. No wonder it won 8 academy awards.A masterpiece worth watching many times. 9/10",9,2,4,8 February 2006
No Man's Land," No one care
","A group of Bosnian soldiers were lost in the fog. The next day they found they were in the shoot range of enemy (Serb). Under heavy attack, Ciki struggled to crawl into the trench between two lines. Then Serb officer decided to dispatch two soldiers to look over. The rookie Nino was chosen. The Serb veteran put a self-made land mine under a seeming dead body of a Bosnian soldier in the trench. After brief exchanging fire, Ciki and Nino survived. Although Ciki wanted to save his wounded companion, how to remove the awesome land mine was a great challenge. Their situation also attracted the attention of UN peace troop.The unexpected ending was really a huge satire. The war is always brutal. However if the mankind loses the humanity, the world will be hopeless.The movie was worthy of winning the best foreign language film (Oscar award).A thought-provoking movie. 8/10",8,4,8,18 January 2006
Million Dollar Baby," A real fighter
","Anything will not be difficult with strong will. The deeds of Maggie embodied completely the saying. Although Maggie was a woman, she liked boxing very much. She suffered much just for boxing. Luckily she encountered a fatherly coach Frankie. Of cause it would not happen without warm-hearted caretaker Eddie. As Maggie won the match once and once again, I felt happy for her.However the unexpected thing happened. Due to a lack of self-protection, her mean opponent punched her from the back. She fell and paralyzed. That was fatal strike for her. After learned her condition, she decided to end her life. I do not think that she was a coward. She just liked Ramon (the sea inside). But she was much luckier than Ramon. She got what she wanted in a short period. She just died like a fighter.Hilary Swank really deserved the Oscar award (the best actress). If I were the referee, I would also vote for her. Now I am looking forward to watching her another award-wining movie Boys don't cry. Clint Eastwood proved his versatility again since his Mystic River. Morgan Freeman finally won the long-awaiting academy award (the best supporting actor).A movie can bring you confidence and courage. 8/10",8,0,0,17 August 2005
Big Fish," Adults need fairy tales too
","The father Ed always liked to tell his interesting story to the people around him. However his son Will did not want to listen to the story because he did not believe it. This time was different. Ed was dying. Maybe it was the last time that Will could listen to his father's favorite story. At last Will understood that the story was actually the life of his father, though it was a little exaggerating. So Will helped his father to finish the story. The son and the father became one man. That was the most touching part in the movie.Sometimes life is boring. Everyday you have to work from nine to five. The route is fixed. Home, company and home. The adults also need something to refresh themselves. Fairy tales does not only belong to children, though the adults are not so imaginative as children. Enjoying fairy tales like a child is beneficial for adult.This time Tim Burton brought us a brighter movie since the depressing Edward Scissorhands. He did tell us an absorbing adult fairy tales. One of the best movies in 2003. 9/10",9,0,0,26 September 2005
The Insider," The world needs justice
","When Jeffrey decided to co-operate with the reporter Lowell, he did not know how it would affect his life. As an upright scientist, he spoke out the truth that the cigarette is harmful for the people. But under pressure from the top level, the program could not be broadcast. After tireless effort, Lowell made the people can watch the program and know the truth.Although they triumphed, Jeffery's family broke up. He paid the bigger price than Lowell. Of cause Lowell did what he could do. He was respectable as same as Jeffrey. The victory belonged to both of them. Without either of them, the victory was impossible.Although the people have the right to know the truth, the truth will not come out automatically. In present world there are many companies to cover the truth in order to make big money. These behaviors are inhuman. We need more fighters like Jeffrey and Lowell.Al Pacino convincingly played the devoted reporter. As one of the best actors in Hollywood, if a movie failed, that was not his fault. For example he should not be responsible for the total failure of Gigli (He had only 10-minute show in it).A very uplifting movie you should not miss. 8/10",8,0,1,25 August 2005
The Hurricane," Encouraging
","It was a true story. The boxing champion Rubin carter (his nickname is called Hurricane) was judged guilty of killing mistakenly. He stayed in the prison for more than 30 years. After long-time effort, he was set free in the end.I wonder how many people can endure such suffering. Of cause life is not all smooth particularly in the present crazy world. So how you do with misery is the key. Now a good example appeared. The performance of Denzel Washington is very contagious. I was totally indulged in the movie. It was wonderful experience for me. According to my experience, Denzel is the idealest actor for the role. His unique character and serious style made the role unforgettable. He should have won the Oscar award (best actor) for it or he did not have to wait for another two years (best actor for Training day).I think that the movie was underrated. As comparison, The shawshank redemption is overrated though it is a good film indeed. In my eyes, TH is more encouraging than TSR. It will bring you more courage.The most uplifting movie I ever watched. 9/10",9,1,5,21 June 2005
The Legend of 1900," Lively piano music
","When 1900 was a baby, he was abandoned in the ship. Since then, he never left the ship. His talents on piano made him welcome. After defeating the black jazz musician, he became more popular. But he was so afraid of getting off the ship that he gave up his love for a girl. His friend Max wanted to persuade him to leave the ship because the ship would be exploded. It did not work. A tragedy could not be avoided. In the end 1900 sank to the sea along with the ship.Although the storyline was weak, the great piano music was good enough to make it uncommon. I particularly like the following scene. When 1900 played the piano for Max, he created different music for different people with different action and expression. The amazing place was that the music was so appropriate. That was the most interesting part of the movie.Tim Roth convincingly played a sympathizing talented pianist. I think that its original sound track is sure to be sold well.If you like piano music, you should not miss it. 8/10",8,0,1,24 August 2005

Luckily she met Jack. She quickly regained her vigor from powerful Jack. They unavoidably fell in love.However life was unpredictable. Due to huge body, Titanic could not adjust promptly its direction so that it collided with the iceberg. 'Unsinkable' Titanic was sinking. An unexpected tragedy happened. The people on Titanic were in panic. Most of them tried to took the limited lifeboats. The most touching scene was that Rose left the lifeboat and ran for Jack. Facing with live-or-die choice, Rose chosen love. In a moment, I experienced the greatness of love. Their love was so strong that anything could not separate them.Director James Cameron did bring us a wonderful story. Simple touching plot and strong visual effect made Titanic so popular in the world. Eleven Oscar awards proved its value.One of the best romance movies. 9/10",9,1,2,8 November 2005

That was a big number of money at that time. He was in despair. Everything changed.Although George was talkative and quick-tempered, he was a kind and generous person. He did not realize his worth until an angel helped him. The most touching scene was his reunion with his family. The following donation from the people transformed my tears into laughs.Sometimes we cannot see clearly ourselves. If we can change the angle and think, the situation will be different.A touching comedian classic. 9/10",9,1,6,9 October 2005

Although the habit nearly ruined her love, she had no regrets.Billy Mack was an out of date singer. He competed for No.1 song with other popular singers. When he won the first as wished, he did not forget his long time partner.Jamie was a writer. When his Portuguese maid left him, he just realized that he loved her so much. He decided to go to Portugal to find her and propose to her on Christmas Eve.The above three stories are my favorites, though the other stories are good too. Love is the best thing in the world. Love has all kinds of type. Any kind of love is worth cherishing; no matter the love exists between relatives, or friends, or couples. Without love, life is meaningless.Thanks director Richard Cutis for bringing me a wonderful film that worth watching many times.One of the best films in 2003. 9/10",9,0,5,29 November 2005

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of this series
","After Anakin saved kidnapped supreme chancellor Palpatine, their relationship became close. Due to help from Palpatine, Anakin joined the Jedi council.

At the same time Anakin was worrying about his secret wife because of his nightmare. Sly Palpatine made good use of the thing that agonized Anakin. A big conspiracy was forming.The movie revealed convincingly Anakin's from-good-to-evil transformation. His experience was disgusting and sympathizing. Of cause the visual effects were still amazing.George Lucas finally completed the wonderful space story with 28 years. Although maybe it was the darkest of this series, I think that it was the best one because of its in-depth description of complicated humanity.A must-see for star wars fans. 9/10",9,1,6,5 December 2005
Lord of War," Lord of death
","Yuri immigrated into America with his parents and brother from Ukraine. They ran a restaurant. But Yuri was not satisfied with his poor life. He was an ambitious young man. He found that he was good at selling guns. He decided to take it as his future career. Due to lacking trust on other people, he persuaded his younger brother to do it with him. A dangerous game commenced.The weapon can not kill people automatically. Only people with weapon can do it. That is right. However if people do not own weapon, killing can be prevented. So weapon trafficking should be eliminated. The earlier the better.In truth the role is not a big challenge for Nicolas Cage, though he acted well in the movie. My favorite movies starred by him are The rock, Face/off, Windtalkers.A thought-provoking movie. 8/10",8,0,2,24 January 2006
The Terminal," People on the road
","I like the atmosphere appeared in the movie. It looked like that everybody just does one's job in the building. Since Viktor came here, everything changed. His arrival brought vigor to the building. But the customs officer did not like him and tried everything to get rid of him. Due to his honesty, kindness and optimism, he won the game. After Viktor helped a man who carried the medicine that was for his sick father, he became a hero. His action won everyone's heart except the cold-blood officer.Life just likes a trip. You will meet different people in the journey. Viktor was unlucky, but he was lucky at the same time. He had a short love story with a beautiful stewardess. His friendship with other three men was impressive. What the old man did for Victor was really amazing. In the end the black guard took off his jacket and put it on Viktor, everyone was on Viktor's side (of cause except one guy), that pushed the film into the climax.No doubt Tom Hanks proved his value with convincing performance. I think even the fussy critic can not say anything wrong on him. Although he won the academy award (the best actor) for Forrest Gump(a wonderful comedian, Tom was great in it), I would rather vote for this role. From the role, I can learn much.One of the best movies in 2004. 9/10",9,1,3,27 July 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Hope
","When you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10",8,1,1,19 August 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Complicated humanity
","The young FBI agent Clarice went to visit the in-jail horrible killer Hannibal in order to solve the series-killer-case. Clarice was afraid of him. She also had the psychological problem that haunted her from the childhood. Although Hannibal treated her with consideration, what he had done was so cruel that nobody could imagine. The strange chemistry reaction happened between them since their first meeting.Hannibal's action embodied the complexity of humanity. He was gentle to Clarice. However he was so brutal to the other people. You cannot believe that was done by the same person. Sometimes we do know little about ourselves.It was rare to see that a movie won the best actor and actress (the academy award) at the same time. It just proved that it was Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster made the movie so outstanding. No one can deny their wonderful performance. The following Hannibal and Red dragon had lost the original idea and could not achieve the astonishing effect that TSOTL brought us.A thriller classic. 9/10",9,8,19,30 September 2005

Even after he became famous, he still kept the laughable habit. His sudden success confused him. He became self-conceited and underestimated his teammates. Even coach Tony could not persuade him. As football is a collective item, that was a fatal mistake. Without effective support, Willie could do nothing. He got the lesson from his silly action.What Tony said in the locker before the playoff game was the most encouraging words I ever heard. His firm voice conquered everyone including me. Unfortunately I can not fight for him. I think that is not just for sports. We also need it everywhere.The convincing performance of Al Pacino proved that he could play any role. At the time unknown Jamie Foxx had won the academy award (the best actor for Ray) now. Cameron Diaz was not impressive as her There's something about Mary. Maybe she is just good at comedian movie.An exhilarating sports movie you should not miss. 8/10",8,1,2,4 August 2005
Before Sunrise," What is called romance?
","American boy Jesse took the train to Vienna in order to take the plane for USA. On the train he met a French girl Celine. Although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. When the train stopped at Vienna, Jesse begged Celine to accompany him to have a tour on Vienna. Then the romantic story unfolded.At first they were cautious. The funniest scene was their listening to CD in music store. They peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. After in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. Then I saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. Their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.Love is a strange thing. When you really want it, it will not come as you wished. Love needs mutual understanding. Without it, love will not last long. Spiritual harmony is the most important for love.Excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.One of the best romance movies. 9/10",9,1,2,13 October 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Triumph
","The mankind finally won the war against the dark lord Sauron. Without co-operation, the victory could not be achieved. Especially Sam played a key role. When Frodo fell in the way to the volcano, he said that I cannot carry the burden for you, but I can carry you. What an encouraging moment. In fact Gollum was the victim of the ring. He was sympathizing and disgusting. His perishing with the ring was the best ending for him.When the four Hobbits bowed to Aragorn, Aragorn said to them that you do not need bowing to us, we should bow to you. Then the rest of people bowed to them. What a touching scene. No doubt the four little man deserved it.There are many elements in the TLOTR trilogy. Good and evil, bright and dark, sacrifice, devotion, friendship, love, betray, they were well embodied in the trilogy. Although a large number of computer-generated effects made the scenes amazing, that was not the point. Of cause the wonderful music cannot be overlooked. I think that TLOTR trilogy represents the highest level of present movie.As to the acting, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen were unforgettable. In all, the acting was satisfying. I think that the Oscar committee should have given the cast an ensemble award. It was said that the trilogy took seven years to shoot. Their effort did not wasted. They will be written into the history of movie. Seventeen Oscar awards proved it.It is the final film of the trilogy. I would like to take the trilogy as one movie because they are inseparable. They are not series like Rocky, Aliens, Jaws, etc. They are a full story. Watching them respectively is meaningless.The trilogy is an all time masterpiece. 9/10",9,1,2,22 August 2005
The Truman Show," Horrible truth
","After Truman was born, he lived in a false world. His actions could be watched by every audience except himself. Even when he was sleeping. In this world only he was a real person. The other people were just the supporting roles. According to the producer Christof, they came on or quieted. So Truman's world was full of lies. One day he found the truth. He chose to leave the false world and lived his real life.Christof really was a cruel guy. How dare he made up a world for Truman? Everybody does not want to be cheated. It is meaningless to live in a fabricated world for any person. Although sometimes the truth is ugly, you have to accept it.This time Jim Carrey brought us not only laughs but also tears. He made the role so perfect that he deserved fully to be the best actor (Golden globe award).An excellent thought-provoking movie. 8/10",8,1,2,23 September 2005
Heat," Passion
","The movie happened just like in real life. It did not glorify the cop and did not qualify the gangster either. If Vincent and Neil were not opponents, they could become good friends. Both of them were astute and firm. Once a goal was set, they would go all out for it. As the gap existed, the tragedy could not be avoided. Of cause the movie had a positive ending. Righteousness triumphed over evil. That is also what we expect to see in reality.In fact Vincent was a responsible man, though he had no enough time to take care of his family. His marriage was on the edge of breaking down. He took too much pressure. Although he looked tired, his passion on work never faded. I appreciate it very much. I think passion is the assurance of success. If we lose it, we can do nothing.As to acting, the wonderful performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro was unforgettable. Although they appeared in Godfather2, they did not act face to face. Heat was their first co-operation. Really hope they can work together again.The movie reminded me of DieXueShuangXiong(English title is The killer, a good HongKong movie directed by John Woo). There was similarity between them, though the background was different. But Heat was deeper than DXSX on the depiction of the role. So Heat can become a classic.One of the best gangster movies. 9/10",9,1,3,28 July 2005
Sin City," Wonderful experience
","When the film started, I knew that I would be drawn to it. As what I expected, the movie brought me new feeling about this kind of movie that adapted from cartoon. The using of black and white made me feel like watching a real cartoon. The story happened in the dark city was unpleasant and depressing. The violence was everywhere. But justice still existed. That was comfortable, though the ending part was sad and touching.If the movie was shot in color, the feeling will be totally different. Maybe I will not be so interested. There are partial colors to emphasize something for example the blood is red. The success of the movie should be attributed to the amazing cinematography.One of the best adapted cartoon movies. 8/10",8,1,3,1 September 2005
Braveheart," A real hero
","At first Wallace did not want to fight against England. He just wanted to live with his wife in peace. However life did not continue like what he wanted. After his wife got killed by cruel English solider, he went all out for combating England. As he triumphed again and again, the sly English ruler wanted to buy over him. He denied and kept on fighting for the freedom of Scotland.Times make a hero. That is correct. Wallace became the hope of Scotland. He would like to do everything for his people, even he accepted the ill invitation. His fearless spirit will exist forever. He is an eternal winner.Mel Gibson brought us a lively Wallace. No doubt Wallace was a hero. He was an ordinary man too. Mel successfully did it.A very uplifting movie. 8/10",8,2,6,27 September 2005
True Romance," Crisp
","Comic bookstore salesman Clarence liked watching martial arts film. When he was watching movie in a theater on his birthday, he met a beautiful call girl Alabama. She came to Detroit just for seeking true love. In fact she was paid to meet Clarence by his boss. They fell in love at the first sight. Although Clarence wanted to take back her clothes from her previous working place, he mistakenly took a suitcase that was full of cocaine. An unavoidable great escape started.This love story was different from common love story. Although it was quite violent in some degree, its straightforward and humorous style was refreshing. Witty talk and lively music made me in an exciting state from start to end. The success of the movie should be attributed to excellent screenplay. Quentin Taratino's talent in writing was proved completely many times by his later famous works (for example: Pulp fiction, Kill Bill 1 & 2). No doubt his directing level was high too.An exciting romance movie. 8/10",8,1,3,30 November 2005
Gladiator," Tragic hero
","The old Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to give the power to his favorite general Maximus. Due to envy, Commodus killed his father Marcus and claimed him as the lawful successor. The misfortune fell on Maximus. After he lost his family, he did not want to live anymore. However life did not go on as he wanted. He was trained as a gladiator. It mattered life and death. If you wanted to survive, you had to kill the opponent.The final duel between Maximus and Commodus was the most soul-stirring duel I ever watched. Although Maximus was a powerful general, he was a kind and generous person. It was his kindness that made him become the victim of insidious Commodus. Maybe he was just fit for leading an army.Russell Crowe convincingly played the brave general Maximus. He was deserved to win the best actor (the academy award). It was a pity that Ridley Scott did not win the best director.A movie that can push you forward. 9/10",9,7,11,20 October 2005
Donnie Darko," The biggest enemy is yourself
","Although Donnie Darko had a mental problem, his parent still loved him. One night he got a horrible message that the world was to an end after 28 days. His peaceful life was broken up. He was not welcome in the school, though he was a clever student. That mainly was because his frankness. Luckily new classmate Gretchen appreciated him very much. They fell in love with each other. But if she knew what he did in the following days, she would not be so happy.Fear is a normal feeling that we can not avoid totally in our daily life. But we should let it under our control or it will destroy you.Jake Gyllenhaal convincingly played Donnie. He was a talented young actor indeed. I am sure that he will have a bright future.An excellent drama. 8/10",8,1,2,19 January 2006
Cinderella Man," What a responsible man
","Jim was a successful boxer. He had a beautiful wife and three cute kids. But things always are too good to last. Due to injury, he began losing match and finally was banned for boxing. It was difficult to find a job for him in Depression. The money was used up quickly. Even he could not pay the electricity bill. One day his agent arranged a special match for him. If he lost it, there was no chance any more.When I watched that Jim walking into the club and begging for money, my eyes were full of tears. He was such a responsible man that he could do anything to support his family, even abandoning his dignity. No doubt the family is worth you fighting for. Self-sacrifice is a virtue indeed.Although CM is similar to another good movie Seabiscuit, it is more touching and uplifting than Seabiscuit. Russell Crowe left me an unforgettable role.One of the best movies in 2005. 9/10",9,0,1,19 December 2005
The Godfather," Italian mafia
","It is quite different from ordinary mafia movie. Of cause there are a few bloody scenes in the movie. But that is not the main point. The all time classic aimed at family life. That makes the mafia movie full of humanity. Although they are mafia, they are still human beings. They also cherish family though the way for protecting family is violent. That is the most attractive place for the movie.As to the director Francis Ford Coppola, he did a great job(in fact Paramont prepared to replace him anytime. Lukily they did not do so). He is an Italian. Maybe Italian emphasizes the importance of family. When he directed the movie, he successfully made the cast like a family. No wonder he still could gather the same cast to shoot Godfather the third after 16 years.As to performance, Al Pacino is unforgettable though he was a rookie. Marlon Brando deserved the Oscar award (best actor). Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also were great. As to the music, still great.A mafia classic you absolutely should not miss. 9/10",9,1,3,27 June 2005
