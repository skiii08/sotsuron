Skyfall," Unrealistic....
","Just watched this film after all the hype of the massive box office success and favorable reviews, but I was terribly disappointed. This isn't a bad film, just terribly annoyed about the numerous unrealistic parts of the film... how could Bond have survived 2 gunshots, still able to fight and balance on top of a moving train, and recover remarkably quickly and soon able to fight off and kill a fully fit hit-man in Shanghai. How did Silva managed to plan to plant bombs at the appropriate places in the subway where he knows he might be caught to distract Bond not once, but twice, the second time to derail a out-of-service train at exactly the right moment. On the frozen lake where the baddie had a chance to shoot him but didn't, and allow themselves to fall into the lake and yet Bond is able to hold his breadth for so unbelievably long, to kill his enemy and surface. Understand that movies need to be exaggerated at times but these scenes had been stretched beyond belief",4,4,10,23 May 2013
