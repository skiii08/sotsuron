Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The general public probably didn't and still won't like it. Who cares?
","Go watch the movie if you haven't yet. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Borat is distastefully provocative, full of surprises, and is loaded with tons of dark humor, but is a sure to be classic film.",9,3,4,28 April 2019
Zootopia," An entertaining and adventurous experience for the young ones and an empowering and relevant message for the more mature ones.
","'A little bit of kindness goes a long way' would be a perfect quote for this film.When Judy Hopps, a country rabbit, shoots for her dreams as a part of the police force in Zootopia(Zootropolis), things weren't what she expected it to be. She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?It may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn't take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn't expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that's what it delivered. The 'true' conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.One small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn't only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.Using cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.Brilliant movie.",8,3,3,2 May 2019
Knives Out," One of the movies to end the year and decade with, Knives Out does well to balance its comic and serious aspects and deliver an impressive murder mystery/dark humor story.
","Going into the film, there was not much I knew about it except for the genre it was categorized under, which was murder/mystery dark humor mix, as well as family drama, which makes up for part of the film's humor. The summary is really all there is one needs to know to get into this film. That and the fact that it's a pretty substantial and provides a very entertaining premise.Acting was superb. Chris Evans (Ransom Drysdale), Daniel Craig (Benoit Blanc), and Ana de Armas (Marta Cabrera) really fit well in the roles of their quirky characters. The supporting cast playing the family members do well to contrast each other in order to create a family that's seemingly cares for each other on the surface.There are also undertones of politics which I believe to be done tastefully, enough to add (flavor) to the film's narrative and characters' personalities, but not to the point where it ruins the enjoyability factor by cramming political opinions and ideas down people's throats.This film is a sure highlight for the year and deserves at least an award nomination, particularly for its writing and directing.",9,1,3,19 December 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Props to Tom Holland for bringing out the best depiction yet of friendly neigborhood Spiderman
","After several years and stand-alone Spiderman films later, Tom Holland now enters the scene as part of the MCU as the latest Spiderman. As Peter Parker finds the time to balance his school life and trying to be a hero, all the while dealing with the hormones of a teenager, he faces another classic Spidey foe.With guidance and support from his Aunt May, best friend Ned, and Tony Stark, Peter Parker does what he has to do to prove that he has what it takes to become not only a friendly neighborhood Spiderman, but also as one of Earth's defenders from evil.Spider-man: Homecoming is a thrilling action paced superhero movie with just the right amount of comedy and drama to fit in with the description of a relatively regular high school Peter Parker. It finds the longings of a young man to be worthy of himself and to others and be independent of others who can take responsibility for his own actions. The cast makes this one of the more lighthearted films in the MCU universe and probably one of the more relatable and attractive superhero films to its young audience.",8,3,4,28 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Spectacular end for a conclusion leading from buildups, still good as a stand-alone film.
","This movie is only really good if you've seen all or most of the movies that led up to it (i.e. From Iron Man, Captain America, the first Avengers Movie, up to Infinity War), but is still a good one if you've seen less or not much of the previous ones.Part of the story is the buildup, which leads to the anticipation of the conclusion. The MCU has tried its best to do just that, and it was done in grand fashion. The twists that comes with this film is executed very well, tying it up with the events of the previous avengers, and a quest to avenge those who have fallen brought forth an epic search, battle, and a sad and heartwarming, yet victorious, conclusion.Animations are of course excellent, as well as the actors for the cast of Avengers. They've put their heart in a franchise that led to a blossoming friendship off and on the screen, which made the cohesiveness and chemistry of this cast really stand out in the film.There's no reason not to see one of the biggest films of the decade. Iif you truly want to enjoy it at its fullest, watch the films in the MCU that led up to the Endgame.",9,0,2,28 April 2019
Aladdin," Viewing this and judging it with no regard for Disney's original Aladdin, this live action remake is actually a decent watch
","Fun, exciting, dazzling...really, this live action remake is actually a fresh and decent remake of Disney's original Aladdin, albeit with a few adjustments to fit a better narrative for this film. Almost nothing can stop anyone from enjoying this film, except of course if they let the original Disney animated cloud their judgement, or take the movie too seriously, et al.The story, cast, acting, setting, are all decent, maybe not much of fleshing out of side characters such as Iago, but it did a good job of entertaining and retelling the story of Aladdin (One Thousand and One Nights) with an actual live cast. Will Smith, in particular, actually does a good job of portraying a fun and playful genie.Of course, musicals such as these are an acquired taste, but as much as possible, watch this like you're imagining the original Aladdin story be retold and done in another manner and perspective, with Disney's usual magical and adventurous twists. I also believe Robin Williams, bless his soul, would have enjoyed this Aladdin.",7,1,3,9 June 2019
Grave of the Fireflies," I can't stand it, and that's what makes it an amazing piece.
","Set in WWII in Japan, this tale tells of the realities of war not on the soldiers' end, but instead, in the eyes of two innocent children.The film is told in a nonlinear manner, leaving the viewer to properly put together the pieces to the plot to form a sad tale of two siblings lost at war.Halfway through the film, I already feel quite uncomfortable with what I've seen so far. It isn't in a way that grosses you out due to a film's excessive use of violence, which wouldn't be surprising on a film where a war is underway. The focus of the film was to show how the casualties of war are as badly affected as soldiers are when bloodshed is involved, leaving people who are unable to defend themselves exposed to vulnerable and harmful conditions. The portrayal of the circumstances in which the siblings were victims of was what made it hard for me to watch. How vulnerable and incapable they were to their circumstances was just heartbreaking.I highly recommend others who haven't seen it to go and do so. Though the animation may not be up to everyone's taste, it makes up for its story and message. It is an eye opener to the hardships people who are left to fend for themselves deal with as soldiers fight for their people, country, and nation, on another front.",8,1,1,28 April 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," Edge of Tomorrow is a fun blend of genres with just the right amount of action to deliver a thrilling blockbuster.
","Live. Die. Repeat. That is how William Cage (Tom Cruise) tries to triumph over an alien invasion after being splattered with the blood of an alien different from a bunch of alien invaders fighting with mankind. He is then trained by Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), a well-known, battle hardened soldier who crosses paths with William Cage.From start till end, the pacing of the film does not drag in a way that exhausts it viewers due to overuse. Use of certain elements in a film (e.g. balancing the right amount of exposure of characters or conflicts in a plot) can give viewers a hard time to follow the story, especially with a 'restarting-the-events' the MC experiences. However, in each restart the further the story goes, there has been a significant character or story development, otherwise, some shorter restarts are just for gags.Overall, it is a very thrilling action packed story with just the right pacing, progression, and development of its characters while they manage to find a solution to end the conflict and save the world.",8,1,1,30 April 2019
