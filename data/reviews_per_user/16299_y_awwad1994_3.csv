The Mask," Did you miss me?!
","I wonder if there is a character that Jim Carrey cannot portray. He displayed The Mask's energy in one of his best performances. Despite Cameron Diaz's beauty, she couldn't steal the show away from Jim Carrey who was on fire. An instant classic and a very entertaining movie to watch. I wish there was a part two; too bad it was put to an end. I'd say that the weak link in this movie was the villain. He needed to be more aggressive and evil, but overall not a bad job. The Mask was a very charismatic character and made the movie more fun to watch. The visual effects were pretty good also. Finally, The Mask is a movie that cannot be skipped when it is on TV; it is too good to be skipped. One that Jim Carrey should be proud of.",7,0,0,24 June 2012
Man of Steel," Finally, the Superman movie we deserved.
","Entertaining, intense, and emotional. Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder have finally brought out the angry, emotional side of Superman; the one I think most of us waited for. The entire cast was incredible, but I wish I saw more of Kevin Costner, and more of how Kal-El was raised by the Kents. I honestly thought there was a chance that Henry Cavill might mess up this movie, but as the time past by, but gladly he proved me wrong; most of Cavill's movies didn't turn out to be good, so I wondered was it because of his bad acting or the plot itself, and now I know why. Cavill portrayed the emotional, furious, kind, afraid, and stubborn Superman greatly, and I don't think not many could've done a better job. Of course, this movie is in an entirely different league than Superman Returns, which will now be completely forgotten. My favorite scene was definitely the final fight with Zod, and I believe it overtakes The Avengers fight scene as the best of all time. Zack Snyder's visual effects brought this movie to life, and it is finally a complete Superman movie.",9,0,1,15 June 2013
Bad Teacher," Once is more than enough..
","The only reason I decided to watch this movie is because I wanted to see how will Jason Segel do (I'm a big fan of How I Met Your Mother). I thought the critics may have been overreacting, but they were absolutely right. This is the kind of movie one should watch when there is absolutely nothing else that one could do with his life. Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel did their job well, but Cameron Diaz didn't. I expected a stronger performance from her, and I wasn't convinced. I was just waiting for the movie to end and I don't think I'll ever watch it again in my life. The end wasn't clear and I didn't understand why did Cameron Diaz choose Jason Segel over Justin Timberlake at the end. The reasons why she did so weren't clear to us. I personally got the feeling that they reached a point where they just wanted to get over with the movie. Therefore, I recommend this movie for those who can find absolutely nothing to do with their lives. If you do, don't waste your time.",2,2,6,24 June 2012
