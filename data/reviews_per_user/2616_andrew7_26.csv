Casablanca," what can I say?
","I have practically nothing to say about this film.  Apparently, some people seem not to like it.  This is utterly baffling to me.  The vast majority of people seem to love it, which is my idea of justice.  This film deserves to be adored. There are two different kinds of Great Films, in my mind.  One is the film that quite obviously sets out to be great, and succeeds.  Something like 'Lawrence of Arabia', 'Citizen Kane', 'Schindler's List', just about everything Kubrick ever did.  That sort of thing.  Films that are oozing with ambition, and manage to carry it off.  'Casablanca' isn't like that. 'Casablanca' is a small film, a simple film, and it doesn't have that ambition behind it.  This film isn't trying to make a statement, or to do something bold, new, and shocking.  It's great simply by virtue of being very, very good.  The primary credit for this goes to those responsible for the script, including the actual scriptwriters, and the authors of the play upon which it was based.  The central premise of this film is the bizarre tangle of motivations involving Rick, Ilsa, and Victor.  That idea is both elegantly simple and breathtakingly effective.  [There again, a common theme in my reviews of late... simplicity and power are natural allies.]  The performances by Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid are fully up to the task, bringing out every nuance of the situation.  This film also sports one of the all time great supporting casts, including big names like Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.  But there isn't a single performance in the entire film which rings false.  This also has a lot to do with pulling this film up from a good one to a great one. 
For those who don't like this film, well, I don't know what to say.  The attitude is incomprehensible to me.  But that's all right.  As long as you've seen it, that's enough.  I think there are a few things that are so good, so useful, and beneficial, that everyone should do them at some point. Take piano lessons.  Study elementary economics.  Watch 'Casablanca'.  And if you don't like it, fine, you don't like it.  But you just have to see it.",10,1,2,25 February 2002
Chinatown," Brilliant Modern Noir
","Film noir doesn't get any better than this.  Gone are the cookie cutter cliches that litter the less imaginative of the genre.  Instead, we have a film propelled by a rare depth, attention to detail, and desire for realism. Thanks to the more permissive cultural environment surrounding filmmaking in the 1970s, we get a movie of haunting power which would be as impossible to make today as it would have been in the 40s.All the elements of classic film noir are present.  We have a tough, gritty private detective.  On the outside, he's a cold man.  But we sense a great weight on his shoulders, and in the end we see that he is motivated more than he lets on by heroic qualities hidden in his own nature.  We have a beautiful, mysterious, and quite possibly dangerous 'femme fatale'.  We have a convoluted plot, which seems to kick off simply enough, but soon spirals out of all control.  We have color photography.Wait a minute?  Black and white photography is a staple of film noir!  How you have film noir in color?  I don't know, but it works.  The film has a kind of dry, parched look to it.  The colors are very dull and muted. Everything is sort of drab and brown.  It's a wonderful look, and it's essential to the ambience of the film.But what really makes this stand out from the crowd is the realism of the story.  J. J. Gittes is a far more real character than Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade.  Like those who came before him, Gittes has a casual, relaxed demeanor, a sharp sense of humor, and a no-nonsense tough-guy persona. But he's not half as slick as those others.  His dialogue, every bit as colorful as Marlowe's or Spade's, has far less of the Hollywood polish and wit to it.
The story is really remarkable.  Of course, the censors would have gone insane over this script back in the 40s.  I mean, not only is it a lot too sexually explicit, but the ending is all wrong.  This is what makes 'Chinatown' such a great film in its own right, and not just another modern homage to great films of the past.  It takes full advantage of the tenor of the times to create a story that couldn't have been done before.
The story is very complex and challenges the viewer to connect their own dots.  The big picture is easy enough to understand, but the details are easy to overlook.  Fortunately, 'Chinatown' stays focused on the story, and never lets the stars get in the way.I'm shocked to see people disapproving of the ending of this film.  I'm even more shocked to see that scriptwriter Bob Towne disagreed with Polanski over it during the production of the film.  How could this film end any differently?  The whole thing is constantly building up this idea of Chinatown, where the best thing to do is as little as possible.  In order for the film to hang together, to stay true to its thematic core, there must be a tragic ending.  This isn't Roman Polanski shooting a dark film to fit his dark mood, this is a capable and astute director filming the only ending that matters.  If the film had ended the other way, you could still say it was a very good film.  I mean, the cast would still be uniformly excellent. The story would still be fascinating and shocking.  The cinematography would have been the same.  But it's heart would have been cut out.  And it could never have been the classic that is today.This is one of the very best films ever made.",10,2,5,27 February 2002
The Big Lebowski," A rare good comedy
","I know a lot of people who hate this movie.  I don't understand those people, but, what can I say?  I find 'The Big Lebowski' to be, not simply a very funny movie (one of the funniest I've seen), but also a damn good movie in terms of character, story, plot, and themes.  So few people are interested in making good comedies anymore.  'The Big Lebowski' is like a gift from heaven. This movie is the rare combination of a film which I can rewatch endlessly, I always find something to make me laugh out loud (it's never the same thing twice), and actually holds up rather well to close scrutiny.  It's a wonderful goofball version of a standard 1950s film noir, updated, of course, and never taken seriously.  But all the elements are there.  It's a terrific spoof of detective movie, but it actually functions successfully as a detective movie.  [Compare to 'Airplane', which is a riotously funny spoof of airplane disaster movies, but only works as a spoof, not as an airplane disaster movie.  'The Big Lebowski' is making fun of detective movies, but it also has a real mystery involved, and a real detective (albeit an unusual one) who actually solves the mystery.]    Great performances make this film, and the cast is to die for.  See it.  If it's not your cup of tea, well, it isn't for everyone.  But for my money, this is definitely not only one of the funniest comedies out there, but also one of the best.",9,1,4,12 February 2002
Fight Club," Hello??? Doesn't anyone care about coherency anymore???
","First, the good stuff.  The acting was superb.  Edward Norton was very strong (though I expected more, somehow) and Brad Pitt was a phenomenon. I'm glad Sean Penn pulled out of this role, though I'm sure he would have nailed it as well (and in a very different way, I'll bet).  The direction was also interesting, though it seemed like the director was enjoying himself to much.  So much of it seemed like the 'wouldn't it be cool if...' style of direction.Now, the bad stuff.  This plot is more full of holes than Independence Day. I mean, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Other reviewers have said that if you go to this movie, you must be prepared to think.  Very true, you must think about the film's themes and the film's subtext every step of the way.  This was extremely interesting and enjoyable.  But whatever you do, please do not think about the plot.  It doesn't hold up under any scrutiny at all.  At a very basic level, this film doesn't make sense.  I can't elaborate without throwing out a huge spoiler, so I won't.If you ask me, plot is the first thing.  If you have a weak plot, that can be forgiven by other strengths.  But if your plot can't even stand up without the willful indulgence of a forgiving audience, then you've already fouled up too big to ignore.  This movie could not have been good without massive script alterations.  No matter how good the acting, how good the directing, how clever the dialogue, this movie could not have been other than a travesty of modern film.  Horrible.On the other hand, from the number of posters here who seem to think that Edward Norton's character was named Jack, it's quite clear that people indeed don't pay very close attention to films.  No wonder this film is so highly regarded.",2,7,19,27 October 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," 10/10 -- Perfect comic genius!
","You have to learn how to watch this movie..., or, at least, I did.  About twenty to thirty minutes in I realized the layers of humor present in the script and the performances.  The more you pay attention, the more you catch.  Whether it's an unobtrusive sight-gag which could easily slip by unnoticed, or a beautiful piece of ironic dialogue, theirs is a gold mine of material here that a casual viewer will just miss.  At the same time, there is present a level of comedy that cannot be escaped.  Viewing it carelessly will produce the idea that the film is a dark and serious film peppered with moments of bizarre physical comedy and the odd pratfall.  Watching more closely reveals that the film is much tighter and more consistent than it might first appear to be.The performances, also, are superb.  Peter Sellers is simply wonderful in all three of his roles (and while I have a hard time imagining it, I bet he would have been great in Pickens's role as well).  George C. Scott takes a script which makes the military look ridiculous (and more than a little disturbing) and milks it to the bone, pulling every ounce of power out of a finely crafted piece of writing.  Especially wonderful is how every character plays everything completely straight.  From experience, I know that this is a difficult kind of comedy to play, i.e., when everything is funny to the audience but nothing is funny to the characters.Lastly, the film is very tight.  Some might complain that it's slow in places, and I suppose that's fair.  But I wouldn't cut or trim a thing.  The long scenes of procedure aboard the plane are absolutely crucial, since the film is about the inanities of military procedure.  The long scenes of dialogue in the war room are absolutely crucial because the film is about the inanities of government decision making.  That, and the fact that the film is just a joy to watch from start to finish, more than make up for any criticism that one may care to make.",10,1,2,17 November 1999
Taxi Driver," Disturbing, powerful, relevant, important
","A towering classic of American cinematic power.  Martin Scorsese teams up with one of the most intense actors of that time to create a masterpiece of urban alienation.  Paul Schrader's magnificent script paints a portrait of loneliness in the largest city of the world.  Travis never once enters into a meaningful relationship with any character anywhere in the film.  He is the most hopelessly alone person I've ever encountered on film.He is alone with his thoughts, and his thoughts are dark ones.  The film fools you on a first viewing.  Is Travis an endearing eccentric?  Sure, he's odd, but he's so polite, and he's got a quirky sense of humor.  His affection for Betsy is actually rather endearing.  But on a second view, you see it for what it is.  The audience comes to see Travis's psychosis gradually, but there's actually far less development than one might think. When he talks about cleaning up the city, the repeat viewer knows he doesn't mean some sort of Giuliani-facelift.  This is less a film about a character in development as it is a kind of snapshot.  To be sure, it takes the stimulus to provoke the response, but does that imply some kind of central change in the character?Tremendous supporting roles are brought to life through vivid performances by Keitel and Foster especially.  Shepard's character, Betsy, is little more than a foil to highlight Travis's utter alienation from society, but she is still impeccably portrayed.  With only two scenes that don't center on Travis, it is unavoidably De Niro's show.  The life with which the supporting cast imbues their characters is a credit to themselves, and to the director's willingness to let the film develop from the intersection of diverse ideas and approaches.  What would the plot lose by eliminating the Albert Brooks character (Tom)?  Nothing at all.  He makes almost no impact on Travis's life, which is where the plot lives.  But his inclusion makes the film as a whole much richer and fuller.As a piece of American cinema history, this film will live forever.  But far more important than that, this film will survive as a universal, ever-relevant examination of the workings of the alienated mind.  The story doesn't end when the credits roll.  We know Travis will snap again.  But the story doesn't end with Travis either.  It continues today in the cities and in the schools.  The film is about the brutal power of the disaffected mind.This film didn't cause the incidents in Colombine, or Hawaii, or Seattle, or wherever you care to look, even with all of its disturbing images of violence.  It didn't cause those things.  It predicted them.",10,526,598,17 November 1999
Barry Lyndon," Overlooked Gem
","When you think of Kubrick, what do you think of?  Strangelove?  Clockwork? Shining?  If you are like most people, you don't think about Lyndon.  That's a shame.  Because it is every bit as magnificent, splendid, and powerful as anything else in his canon.  The true genius of Kubrick, according to Spielberg, is that he never made the same film twice.  Because of this, comparing one Kubrick film to another is a tricky situation.  It also means that, for just about everyone, there is going to be a Kubrick film that just doesn't do it for you.  [If there's such a one for me, I haven't found it yet.]  Kubrick didn't make very many films, all things considered, but he managed a breadth most directors will never reach.  'Barry Lyndon' is Kubrick's foray into the costume drama.  It is the most realistic such film I've ever seen.  I don't mean that the story, plot, or characters are realistic (certainly they are, but there are loads of costume dramas realistic in that sense), but the cinematography, through Kubrick's innovative use of light and specially constructed lenses, makes this film look utterly remarkable.  I really feel as if I'm watching things that are actually happening.Ken Adam did the production design on this film (as he had done on 'Dr Strangelove'), and once again he scores a triumphant victory.  Also the costumes, the locations.  Every visual element of the film is a remarkable achievement, and would make this film worthy of the highest praise. 
So why has the film become such a curiosity?  Why are otherwise film-literate people, who are intimately familiar with many of Kubrick's other films, totally unaware of 'Barry Lyndon'?  Apparently, the story isn't very good.  Well, that's what I gather from reading the other reviews here. The story isn't very good.  It's boring and too long. 
Too long.  Of all the things anyone has ever said about a film, 'too long' annoys me the most.  As if length were a primary characteristic of a film. It's not.  Length is simply of function of what the director has chosen to include in the film, and the pace.  Certainly, 'Barry Lyndon' has a very slow pace.  But I consider this a strength.  Like '2001', 'Barry Lyndon' tells its story through a very different narrative approach.  The basic story is extremely simple.  If you read a transcript of the narration and dialogue, you would see the simple, skeletal framework of the plot.  And for a 3 hour film, it is a very thin framework.  But because the pace is so slow, Kubrick enables the actors to convey a far more complicated palette of emotions than the thin story would otherwise allow, and they convey these emotions through  superb subtlety.  A long look, and pensive sigh...  A ten second shot of Lady Lyndon with Lord Bullingdon in her arms, perfectly still, unchanging expression.  These shots, these 'long', 'boring', 'pointless', shots reveal so much more about the story and the characters than our hypothetical transcript ever could.  But why choose such a way as that to reveal the full depths of the story? Because Kubrick was a film-maker.  Any given story can be told in any number of ways.  As Kubrick was telling this particular story (one which had already been told in novel form) in cinematic form, he chose to rely, in so far as possible, on purely cinematic tools.  Dialogue is common to film, radio, and prose.  But the effect of that glorious shot of Lady Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, which is only one of so many beautifully composed shots dripping with emotion, could not have been communicated in any other medium. That is why Kubrick is such a great filmmaker.  He understood the unique tool he had in the medium of film and he shared its power.  He stripped this film of as much as he could that is not unique to film, and left us with a glimpse at what film, and only film, is capable of bringing to the art of narrative fiction.  Also, the film has a wonderfully dry, ironic wit which is all too often overlooked.",9,1,3,5 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Utter Failure
","I'm shocked at how immensely popular this film is so far.  I'm used to finding fault with overwhelmingly popular films.  For instance, I think 'American Beauty' is good, but far far over-rated.  But this is something new for me.  This is a film that is overwhelmingly adored, which I find to be not only over-rated, but not even any good at all.This is a bad movie, plain and simple.  Its got a really bad script.  The characters are terribly thin (with one exception: Gandalf), and certain events have been so hurried that either they lack all dramatic force (The Council of Elrond) or they are utterly impenetrable to someone who doesn't already know what's happening (Lothlorien).  I realize that Jackson had the near impossible task of condensing The Fellowship of the Ring into a mere three hours (I think four is necessary, at an absolute minimum).  But the decisions he made (what he omitted, what he condense, and what he lengthened) reveal his intention to make an epic action film, rather than an epic fantasy adventure film. 
Even the flaws of this movie are entirely in keeping with that goal.  Action movies don't need good characters.  They need good special effects.  Action movies don't need drama, they need fights.  There is a very small minority of filmgoers who feel that action is boring. As long as the characters are fighting, they are not in any way advancing the story.  And for a story to be good, it has to move.  There is plenty of movement in The Fellowship of the Ring.  But there are also massive sequences where the story advances not one jot for unendurable stretches of time, to allow the characters (or their obviously computer-generated counterparts) to battle some massive computer-generated foe.  The worst offender is the Moria sequence, which was at least twice as long as it ought to have been.  To those of you who say that this is the best movie ever made, I must strenuously disagree.  It's not the best movie I've seen this year, much less ever.  Nor is it the best movie I've seen this month, or even this week.  This movie is bad.  And I loved the books.Drew",3,2,4,24 December 2001
American Beauty," The closer I look, the worse it gets
","I first saw this in theaters back in 1999.  I loved it.  I really really loved it.  I've seen it four or five times since, and each time, I like it less.  I just saw it again a couple of days ago, and I stopped it before it was over.  At that moment, I decided to sell my DVD.  It has now been excised from my DVD Collection, about which I have considerable pride.The main reason is that I have come to feel very strongly that this film doesn't know what it wants to say.  It takes a bunch of characters, constructs various relationships between them, and sets them loose to run around for two hours, at the end of which, what have we learned?
I've heard lots of people make comparisons between this film and another highly acclaimed movie of 1999 which I hate:  Fight Club.  Both films include philosophically flimsy but highly entertaining critiques of materialism.  With Fight Club, the critique on materialism is made by the character who turns out to be the villain of the piece, who seeks to replace it with fascism.  In American Beauty, the anti-consumerist is, first of all, a total hypocrite, and second of all, has a life changing epiphany the moment before his death, but never gets a chance to expound upon what that epiphany was.On the hypocrisy charge, consider the oft-quoted scene when Lester Burnham (magnificently portrayed by Kevin Spacey) yells at his wife Carolyn (played in an over-the-top caricature by Annette Bening) for placing too high a value on material things, in this case, a sofa.  Fine.  He makes a good point.  No one else seems to have noticed, however, that this is precisely the same scene where it is revealed that Lester has bought a 1970 Pontiac Firebird.  Since we at no time see Lester enjoying the use of his car, the implication is that possession of the object is a good in itself, which is the very apex of materialism.There are lots of other things that we don't see, and I never noticed until I 'looked closer' how conspicuous they are in their absence.  We never see Angela or Jane don a cheerleading uniform after their initial cheerleading scene.  They never make any reference to being cheerleaders.  The whole concept of cheerleading, then, is merely a mechanism (and quite a contrived, not to mention cliched mechanism at that) to introduce Lester to Angela.
I also noticed, when I looked closer, how painfully bad much of the dialogue given to the younger characters is.  'Lame-o'  'Geekboy'  'Take a whizz' It's just horrid.  And why, exactly, was Jane looking at a breast augmentation website?  First of all, her breasts don't appear to need augmenting (when I saw this in theaters, I thought she must want to reduce her breasts, but upon looking closer, the computer monitor clearly says 'augmentation', which means a process of adding to).The worst flaw of the film, by far, is the fact that we have one horrible cliche repeated twice in the space of minutes in the final act.  The homophobic marine turns out to be a repressed homosexual, and the slutty cheerleader turns out to be a virgin.  For the love of God, who let those two howlers slip through.  Bad enough that either made the final cut, but both?!!  It defies understanding.The scene that made me turn the film off, this final time that I watched it, was the scene were Jane and Ricky decide to run off together.  I was never very comfortable with this scene, because, call me conservative, I'm just not thrilled about a girl dropping out of school at the tender age of seventeen (or so) and running off with her drug dealer boyfriend.  But what really got my goat was when Ricky ridiculed Angela by calling her ordinary. Fair enough, Angela had it coming.  But for Ricky to not only accept Angela's principle that ordinariness is bad, but to use it against her... that bothered me.  Ordinariness or lack thereof is not a valid criterion for judging the worth of a human being.  Ricky, having been set up (clumsily) as a heroic character, shouldn't have descended to such a twisted and hateful principle.The whole film has the feel of having been made up as it went along.  It is radically different from how it was originally planned to go.  The prelude sequence and the scene later in the film which it foreshadowed have become utterly pointless since the removal of the subplot about Jane and Ricky being blamed for Lester's murder.  Now, that subplot is a bit ridiculous, and was cut for a good reason, I agree.  But why leave the set up if you're cutting the payoff?  [Notice that Ricky shuts off the camera before Jane says 'You know I'm joking, right?']The sequence where Col. Fitts spies on Ricky and Lester is straight out of 'Three's Company.'  Fitts sees just enough to draw the conclusion that the writer wants him to draw, and nothing else.  That's a classic example (and the most blatant I can recall from any film) of bad, contrived plotting. What exactly was up with Mrs. Fitts?  Presumably, her scenes meant something in some previous, unreleased version of the story.  The initial meeting between Lester and Ricky is built on numerous coincidences... Ricky just happens to be working there, and he works there just long enough to meet Lester!!!  And what self-respecting drug dealer would give a man $2,000 worth of merchandise on the assumption that he'd be willing/able to pay for it later?  It would have been more contrived if Lester happened to have $2,000 in cash while jogging, but 'I know you're good for it' isn't much better.This film is ambitious.  There are lots of individual pieces of greatness in it.  There are a lot of really good ideas.  But on a fundamental level, it just doesn't work.",6,48,90,5 February 2002
Apocalypse Now," Amazing Achievement
","I have very little to add about this remarkable, powerful, incredibly demanding film.  But I would like to draw special attention to the performance of Marlon Brando as Col. Walter Kurtz.  I know, everyone talks about how great Brando is, but I want to really focus on what it is that makes him so great in this particular role.  While the character of Kurtz is utterly central to this film, Brando does not appear (except as a disembodied voice on an audio recording) until the final act of the film.  In the meantime, as we follow Capt. Willard on his journey, the image of Kurtz in our minds becomes bigger and bigger.  Like Willard, the more we here about Kurtz, the more fascinated we become, and the film quite cleverly intersperses the various episodes of the journey with additional information on Kurtz, thus constantly building the tension toward the ever approaching finale.  When Willard finds Kurtz's followers (including Dennis Hopper's memorable photojournalist), our image of Kurtz changes and grows again.  What sort of a man could inspire this sort of reaction in these people.  When Willard finally meets Kurtz, the dramatic tension has been ratcheted up so high, no one has any idea what will happen.  Will Willard kill Kurtz, or become another of his followers the way his predecessor did?After having kept the audience waiting for so long, the introduction of Kurtz has got to at least fulfill, if not transcend, the expectations of the audience.  If not, the last act will be a terrible anti-climax, and the film as a whole will be a dramatic failure.  Has there ever been a film which put so much pressure on one performance?  If there has, I don't know it. 
But Brando nails it.  He takes our expectations and he trounces them.  The image of that massive hand on top of that bald head will stay with me forever.  The voice, almost ethereal.  To build an entire film as a massive, gradual build to a climax, and have that climax surpass even the promise of the build-up... it's an exhilarating movie experience. 
After the climax, Willard walks slowly back to his boat.  Kurtz's followers first make way, and then follow him.  Clearly, the idea is that, in their eyes, Willard has no attained the God-like status of Kurtz.  In their eyes. Not in ours.  We get the point, we understand the message, but we don't feel it in this way.  Why?  Because Martin Sheen just walks back to the boat.  He just walks back to the boat.  There is nothing about Sheen's performance here that makes the audience see him as a God-like figure, the way we saw Brando.  We get the God imagery from the way the others respond to his walking back to the boat.  Sheen isn't acting like a character who is seen as a God.  Sheen is walking back to the boat.  The others are acting like characters who see him as a God.  So, the perception of Willard as God-like has nothing to do with Sheen's performance.  But what about the prior perception of Kurtz as God-like?  The most remarkable thing about it is that we barely see Kurtz interact with anyone except Willard.  While the long, gradual build-up certainly helps to build up the mythology around Kurtz, in the final analysis, Brando is solely responsible for bringing it on home.  [Well, to be fair, the lighting helps a great deal too.]  Because we don't see hundreds of extras treating Kurtz like a God, Brando has to act like a God in order for us to get it, and in order for the film to work.  It's stunning.",9,0,1,5 February 2002
Being John Malkovich," Clever, Original, but Slight
","'Being John Malkovich' is a film with a wonderfully creative, refreshingly original concept, but burdened with one-dimensional characters and a very flimsy plot.  You know what though?  It doesn't matter.  The concept is so good that it's enough by itself.  The only really serious criticism I have of the film is that, on repeated viewings, the minor weaknesses reveal themselves more fully, but this seems like such a small, petty complaint to level at such a fresh, inventive film. So, is it just a gimmick movie?  Well, yeah, it really is.  But the gimmick is executed with some real flair.  What saves this from being just some minor art house curiosity is primarily the work of two people: John Malkovich (whose performance in this film has been criminally underappreciated) and Charlie Kaufman, who wrote the script. 
What allows 'Being John Malkovich' to succeed as it does is the continuity of the characters, even as they go about inhabiting various bodies.  Thus, even though John Cusack disappears for a large stretch of the film, his character, Craig Schwartz, is in it from beginning to end.  This is a very difficult feat, and the script deserves a lot of credit.  But Malkovich, in particular, deserves the credit, for undertaking the performance of three very distinct characters in this film.  Now, giving a single performer multiple roles is not a such a big deal.  But in this film, Malkovich had to take over characters from other actors and continue them.  When Schwartz finally takes over Malkovich, that's the last we see of Cusack for a considerable time.  But Schwartz is still there.  Same again when Dr. Lester (or, if you prefer, Captain Mertin) takes over.  Continuity is kept with the previous actors and their respective performances.  This is so crucial to make this film work, and the both scriptwriter and the actor deserve credit both for appreciating the importance, and actually making it work. 
So, sit back and enjoy this truly inventive, clever, and original film. Just don't think about it too hard.  Don't worry about the mechanics of Lester taking people with him.  Don't worry about the utter arbitrariness of Craig's infatuation with Maxine.  Don't worry about the even more arbitrary pairing of Lotte and Maxine.  Don't worry about how Maxine could possibly know whether the child was Lotte's or Craig's.  Don't worry about the odd coincidence of Emily (the new vessel) being the daughter of Malkovich (the old vessel), and don't worry about how Lester knew this, or knew anything else about the portal, or where the portal was before the Mertin Flemmer Building was built. If you want to be a stick in the mud, these are legitimate questions.  But it just spoils the fun.  And in a film as fun as this, that's a truly terrible thing to do.",8,1,3,12 February 2002
Dark City," Rich, rewarding film
","This film is as layered and as deep as you want it to be.  If you're just looking for an exciting sf film with aliens, special effects, and a little nudity thrown in for good measure, this is it.  But, if you care to delve a little deeper, there's a lot to explore here. The principle theme is the link, if any, between memory and identity.  All of the characters in this film had lives before the film began.  But, they have no memory of those lives, and they have no real connection with those lives.  The people who they now think that they are may have nothing whatsoever in common with who they 'really' are (or, perhaps more accurately, who they 'originally' were).  Consider John Murdoch.  We've got here your typical action hero with no memory.  He doesn't know he's an action hero, he doesn't know his name is John Murdoch (he deduces it).  He is carried along by events, pursued by multiple quarters, has friends he can't remember and can't trust, and begins putting together the pieces of a vast mystery.  Eventually, he discovers his true powers and decides to take an active role in the proceedings.  Standard sf/action plot (and, based on the trailers, it looks like 'The Bourne Identity' will run along similar lines).  Of course, as others have noted, it bears a certain similarity to 'The Matrix', which is a tour de force of incredible special effects, great fight scenes, and truly horrible acting in service of a shoddy, predictable, and poorly structured script.But anyway, look beyond that and consider the issues involved.  Is John Murdoch a murderer?  Consider the question 'Who is John Murdoch?'  John Murdoch is not a 'real' person with a 'real' history.  He is a fiction.  He was created by the Strangers as part of their macabre experiment.  According to the Strangers' plan, he is a murderer.  Therefore, yes, John Murdoch is a murderer.  He caught his wife cheating on him, and snapped, and went out on a rampage killing prostitutes  (and seriously, isn't that exactly what you would do?... uh, well, nevermind). But then, is the character portrayed by Rufus Sewell a murderer?  Seems not. He's very disturbed early in the film as he begins to find the evidence that suggests that he killed those prostitutes.  He doesn't want to kill prostitutes, has no reason to kill prostitutes, and is very upset at the thought that he may have killed prostitutes.  Which leads to the inescapable conclusion that the character portrayed throughout this film by Rufus Sewell is not John Murdoch (though he does have fragments of Murdoch's memories). In fact, in a fascinating twist, John Murdoch ends up being played by Richard O'Brien, which confirms for us, if any confirmation is needed, that Murdoch is a murderer.   What the film seems to suggest, and it's an unappealing idea, is that identity and memory are precisely the same thing.  Mr. Hand becomes John Murdoch when he acquires the memories of John Murdoch.  Rufus Sewell's character is not John Murdoch because he does not have those memories. 
So we reach the conclusion of the film, where we have the primary philosophical dispute between this film and The Matrix.  Sewell's character has defeated the Strangers by appropriating their power, and not stands God-like over their abandoned city.  He reshapes it according to his own desires.  Presumably, with all of his powers, he'd be able to return himself and everyone else to Earth (from whence, presumably, they had been abducted).  But he chooses a pleasing fiction over an uncertain reality. This is precisely the choice of Joe Pantoliano's character in The Matrix (and, because his character is a 'villain' betraying the heroes, the audience understands this to be the wrong choice).  So, The Matrix values truth above experience.  Between to alternatives, one good and one bad, the one which corresponds to truth is preferred.  The truth-value of the situation trumps whatever other value is concerned.  But in Dark City, the truth value is irrelevant.  John Murdoch (and now, finally, Sewell is John Murdoch, but a new Murdoch created by Dr.  Schreber, not a murderer, but with many of the same core memories, such as Shell Beach and Uncle Karl) freely chooses a life which he knows to be false (because he created it). 
I've always said that Joe Pantoliano's character was the only intelligent character in The Matrix.  I stand by that.  He was wrong to betray his friends, yes, but he was right in recognizing that ignorance is bliss.  This film shows us that fact clearly.  It's also a terrific story, well-acted, marvelously directed, with incredible sets, stunning visuals, and a quick pace that never lags.",10,1,4,26 April 2002
Resident Evil," Guilty Pleasure
","This film is extremely bad... among the worst I've ever seen.  But I loved it anyway.  The script was just terrible.  I mean, the plot is extremely flimsy, not one character in the film is worthy of the term, and the whole thing is just a big budget excuse to to make a movie about zombies.  It doesn't have any of the tension of the original video game,   it doesn't have any of the characters of the original game, and, in fact, it bears remarkably little resemblance to the game at all.  Some people seem to think it's a prequel to the game.  I don't understand how that works, exactly.  I mean, the end of the movie looks exactly like the beginning of Resident Evil 2 (the game), so it's a prequel to the game's sequel.  I don't know.  But don't think about it.  Just enjoy the cheese. 
Like that elevator scene in the beginning.  Tremendous.  So bad you can't help but love it.  The whole audience cheered when that happened.  Great. 
Just to illustrate how little this film cared about it's characters, I'd like to point out that Alice's name is never mentioned on screen until the final credits.  I actually stayed in the theater and waited because I wanted to know her name.  Apparently, she didn't want to know.  Because even after meeting someone she believed knew her, she didn't ask.  Of course, that begs the question why was she suffering amnesia at all?  From a production point of view, it's a convenient (if hackneyed) way to introduce suspense.  Or maybe, since the story was so bad, they wanted to conceal it from the audience for as long as possible.  So, give your protagonist amnesia, and suddenly, none of the characters know what's going on, so the story doesn't present itself to the audience until long after the zombie brain-munching buffet has begun.  But, from a fictional point of view, why would the computer have done that?  Trust me, though, that is absolutely the smallest one of many, many plot inanities.  This movie it truly wretched.  Unless you have a soft spot for big-budget b-movies starring talented actors masquerading as vacuous eye-candy, stay far far away.  But like I said, I loved it.",Null,0,1,4 April 2002
Dog Day Afternoon," Brilliant
","If you haven't seen this film, go out and rent it right now.  Just sit back, relax, have a beer, and watch a terrific movie.  It has drama, humor, great acting, a great story, and an ending that hits you right in the gut.A few weeks from now, maybe a few months, see it again.  There is so much of what I like to call 'meat' in this film.  It's a true story, and a compelling one, but look beneath the immediate to see what this film tells us about the culture of New York City, of America, in the early 1970s. American society was sick and rotting from the inside.  Watergate was festering, but had yet to explode into the orgy of political pus which destroyed the Nixon presidency.  Vietnam was still being fought in the jungles of Asia and on the streets of America.  Generations were clashing, and American culture and society was divided against itself.None of this context is directly provided by the film, but it is all relevant.  Look at the attitude of the mob to the whole situation.  That mob is the most fascinating character of the picture.  First, they totally support Sonny.  They make him a celebrity.  He's the classic noble outlaw. Robbing the bank, sticking it to the man, and making the police look at the same time inept, ridiculous, and utterly corrupt.  But when a shot is fired, the crowd realizes, for the first time, that their celebrity misfit criminal could be dangerous, and things begin to change.  Mulvaney, the bank manager sees it.  'That was a foolish thing you did, back there.'  When it is revealed, shockingly, that Sonny is a homosexual, the mob divides against itself.  A small, vocal core of homosexuals begin supporting him, while the rest of the mob, the 'mainstream' of American society, turn viciously against him.  By the time he is escorted to the airport when the siege is over, the crowd has turned wholly against him, and the cops protect him from the public, rather than the other way around.The mob is America.  Sonny is crime.  Not just any crime, but crime born of desperation.  Sonny is an outcast from society.  He has worked all his life (so we are told), but has never been able to provide adequately for his family.  He talks frequently about the pressures he is under (and the pressures he faces on screen mirror the pressures that drove him into his predicament in the first place).  He is trapped by a hopeless, helpless urban nightmare, and he's being drowned by the expectations of wife, lover, children, parents, and society itself.  He is a Vietnam veteran, and still there is nowhere he can turn for help.So, he robs a bank and takes hostages.  Suddenly, everyone cares about him. The Establishment, suddenly, becomes terribly interested in Sonny's problems.  Oh, they despise him, to be sure, and they want him dead.  Sonny knows that.  But suddenly, he is being listened to.  Imagine what might have been if someone out there had been interested in Sonny's problems *before* he robbed the bank.Imagine that.",Null,2,4,28 May 2002
Amadeus," Complex, powerful
","The central premise of this film is remarkable in that, for its complexity, it remains remarkably powerful.  In film, as in music, as in almost every realm of human experience, complexity and power are natural enemies. Complexity dilutes power.The central premise of 'Amadeus' concerns Salieri's motives for killing Mozart.  [As an aside, whether or not Salieri killed Mozart in this film is utterly irrelevant... what's important is that Salieri wanted to kill him, hatched a plan, put the plan in motion, and Mozart died.  Whether or not there is a causal link is entirely beside the point.  Of course, whether or not Salieri killed Mozart in reality is even less relevant.]  Of course, Salieri was jealous of Mozart's talent, but if that were all there was, it would be a poor film indeed.  Salieri didn't want to attack Mozart (not directly, though certainly, this was involved).  Salieri wanted to attack God.  God, who had given Salieri an inexpressible longing to music, but had not given him the talent to pull it off.  If one accepts this premise, it is very easy to accept Salieri's conclusion, that God is cruel, because to give a man an all-pervading desire and deny him the ability to achieve it is a great cruelty.  Greater still to force him to watch it achieved by such a vulgar man as Mozart.  So, in this contest, the players are Salieri and God, and Mozart is just the battlefield.  This is complex, and it is powerful.  It is also, by virtue of its complexity, interesting.  Fascinating.  Compelling.  More than justifying the running time of this magnificent film. 
The performances are a bit uneven, though.  F. Murray Abraham is superb as Antonio Salieri.  His voice, his face, his posture, manner, all perfect. 
The script is great.  I've talked about the story, but the script also is masterful.  And the music.  It's easy to talk about how great the music is, but be sure to notice, beyond that, how well the music is used.  Any film can have great music... there's loads of it around, just find some and throw it in the film.  But to use music to its fullest and best extent is something else. This film nails it.  I'll never forget the bedroom transcription scene, when Salieri is helping Mozart with his Requiem.  Brilliant.  We hear each part, one at a time, and think 'Oh, yes, that's quite good.'  But then, hearing it all together, it's a shock... a visceral, stomach clenching shock.  And while hearing this incredibly powerful, yet complex (hmmm) music finally coming together, we see Frau Mozart's carriage returning her to Vienna.  We have no specific reason to dread her return, but the music, so full of dread, prepares us masterfully for the final confrontation. 
Ahh, a spectacular film which rewards every viewing.  One for the ages.  So few movies of true and lasting quality emerged from the culturally bankrupt 1980s.  This is one to cherish for all time.",9,2,5,31 January 2002
Moulin Rouge!," A trifling, insignificant little film
","You're not going to believe this, but the film I was most strongly reminded of when I watched 'Moulin Rouge' was 'Mission: Impossible 2'.  Both Baz Luhrmann and John Woo have developed a very recognizeable visual style, and both of them are perfectly willing to tear a script to shreds in order to maximize the visual effect of their films.  Each film is an empty, dessicated husk of a motion picture, lacking any real content or substnace at all.  Both are pleasant to look at and, if one's standards are sufficiently low, passably entertaining.  The fact that one is an action movie and one a musical seems a very minor difference to me.The plot of 'Moulin Rouge' is both hackneyed and bad, which is a disasterous combination.  But then, this is a musical, intended for a musical audience. A musical audience is one for whom singing and dancing are more important than plot and story.  Similarly, M:I2 is an action movie, intended for an action movie audience, for whom chases, fights, and explosions are more important than plot and story.And what's all this bellyaching about the film being overlooked for Best Director and Best Editing awards by the Academy?  The editing was a significant drawback to the film.  The pace was so frenetic that it was impossible to develop any sort of emotional attachment to any of the characters.  The direction was extremely clumsy.  Check out my review of 'Apocalypse Now,' the bit at the end where I talk about Brando's performance.  Coppola pointed a camera at Brando and filmed a great actor at work.  Now, there's no Brando in this movie, but the cast is very talented. It is not necessary to provide a few seconds of menacing slow motion when Zidler orders Satine to stop seeing Christian, because Broadbent is a talented actor (who has finally been recognized, hooray!) who is perfectly capable of delivering the line with all the menace you need.  Coppola is a genius and Luhrmann is hack precisely because Coppola knows what his job is, and Luhrmann doesn't.Luhrmann constantly uses the camera, the editing, or some distracting special-effects shot to unnecessarily underscore points that the actors are perfectly capable of making themselves.  Compare to Oliver Stone, whose own ingenious editing style has been harshly attacked by many critics and filmgoers.  In 'Any Given Sunday', Stone uses editing to allow characters to clearly convey multiple emotions simultaneously.  Pacino delivers a line laced with nostalgia and regret, while an image of Pacino screaming in rage appears silently on the screen.  Stone uses his camera to give the audience information in addition to what the actor is giving.  Luhrmann uses it to give the audience the same information, only without subtlety or grace.Basically, take 'Shakespeare in Love', get rid of the wit, dumb-it-down a bit, throw in spectacular sets and costumes (credit where due), sing some anachronistic songs (which was sacrilege in 'A Knight's Tale' but somehow genius here... go figure), and there you are.  'Moulin Rouge'.Many say you either love this film or hate it.  I obviously don't love it, but I don't hate it either.  There's nothing there to hate.  There's nothing there at all.",Null,10,19,2 April 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Awful
","Massive plot holes, under developed characters, ridiculous (and boring) action sequences combine to make this film fun, if you're in the right frame of mind, but basically crap, when you get right down to it.  John Woo is all over this film, which is a serious drawback for fans of realism and believability.  He's not a very good storyteller, but his style is uniquely exciting on its on.  Someone, please, give this man a decent script.",3,0,1,26 May 2000
The Insider," Brilliant film.... stunning
","If you liked The Sixth Sense and Fight Club, watch this and find out what a great film is supposed to be like.  If you liked American Beauty, come see its strongest Oscar challenger so far this year.  Personally, I find The Insider to be hands down the best film I've seen so far this year.People will say (have said, actually) that it's boring or too long.  If you see this movie, be prepared.  It is long.  But I never once looked at my watch (notwishstanding the fact that I don't have one), and I was never bored for a moment.  I was completely engrossed from start to finish.  At movie's end, I would have happily sat down again (after a brief stretch) and watched it again, despite the lateness of the hour.The performances are magical.  Pacino, Crowe, and Plummer all must be seen. Let's hope this pushes Crowe up a notch in the realm of professional respectability.But it's the direction that makes this film.  When it's praised, it's the director being praised.  The long pauses, which irritate some (when it's criticizes, it's the director being criticized), provide the viewer with a peaceful moment which is needed to process and come to terms with the material.  The story is not thriller material, but the direction provides all the tension and excitement of a thriller.  But most thrillers are mindless, and a savage, relentless pace doesn't hurt the narrative.  In this film, however, the tension and excitement must never be allowed to obscure the story.  The pauses allow for the audience to stay with the story.  They are gently pulled along with the events, rather than having images and ideas simply thrown up at them.Lastly, I would just like to point out that Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand, as they are portrayed in this film, are probably the two most heroic, admirable characters I've ever seen on film.",10,0,1,7 November 1999
Annie Hall," Essential Woody
","This was the film that made me a fan of Woody Allen.  It wasn't the first Allen film I'd seen (I saw Deconstructing Harry in theaters before I knew anything at all about Woody Allen), but it made me a fan for life.  This film contains everything modern viewers tend to associate with Allen's work: great dialogue, wonderful humor, elements of philosophy, and a playful, inventive tone.  'Annie Hall' is the perfect expression of Allen's overall style.  It is the benchmark against which all his other films are and should be judged.  It is his supreme artistic achievement.  It's a wonderful movie.  Uproariously funny in places, but also heartfelt, poignant, touching, warm, and sad.  Alvy Singer is an instantly likeable character.  The first scene, Alvy talking directly to the audience against an empty background, perfectly sets the tone of the film.  It is the ultimate expression of unreality.  Here we have a character, who explicitly refers to himself as a character (i.e., this is not Woody Allen providing a prologue to a film about Alvy Singer, this is Alvy Singer), talking directly to the audience, from where?  From no place.  It's not unheard of for a character to talk to the audience.  'Alfie', for instance, uses this device throughout.  But usually, there are rules attached.  In 'Alfie', the title character talks to the audience constantly, but no one else can here what he says.  Occasionally, he gets confused, and says something to another character that he meant to say to us, which they can hear.  But in 'Annie Hall', this device has no rules whatsoever.  It's entirely haphazard.  Whereas when Alfie steps out of a scene, he becomes removed entirely from the other characters, when Alvy steps out of a scene, Annie might join him.  Or she might not.  (Hmm, Alvy... Alfie... connection?)  Anyway, the whimsical approach to a very human, universally identifiable story, is precisely what makes the film so magical.  What makes this film so special is the variety of the techniques employed.  We've talked about direct monologue already, but we also get conversations across a split screen, characters physically moving through and interacting with their own flashbacks, animation... you name it!  Gimmickry?  Well, I don't think so, but I would understand if you did.  This manipulation of the form of the film is absolutely essential, in my opinion, to the fullest exploration of the central character (who is not Annie Hall, but Alvy Singer.... we end up knowing comparatively little about Annie by the end of the film).   
I could go on all day about this extraordinary film, but I'll stop instead. If you haven't seen it yet, do it!!  At the very least, it's incredibly funny.",10,0,1,25 January 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," Best sf film ever made
","The list of good sf films is extremely short.  Topping that list, with a good bit of space between it and number 2, is '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Browsing the other IMDB comments, I see that this is basically a love it or hate it film.  Many people seem to dislike this film intensely, and many call it boring.  I can't imagine finding a film like this boring, but hey, that's me.  Fellowship of the Ring was boring.  This is edge-of-your-seat material.  I honestly can't take my eyes off the screen. 
Anyway, the other camp consists of people like me who simply can't stop gushing about the film.  There is a very small minority who like, or even love the film, but call it 'flawed'.  The definition of 'flaw' is such a subjective one, though.  To my mind, there are definitely aspects of this film which many people will not, do not, and never were expected to like. But they're not flaws.  Not to me.  Yes, the plot is notoriously difficult to penetrate.  When asked about the story, Arthur C. Clarke said something like 'Watch the film.  Read the book. Watch the film again.  Read the book again.'  Quite obviously, Kubrick and Clarke (who developed the film together... neither the film nor the book was 'based on' the other) intended the plot to be opaque, intended the finale to be ambiguous, and intended to encourage audiences to think about the film and draw their own conclusions.  Now, if you are a film-goer who dislikes ambiguity, who wants a simple story simply communicated to you (and there's not a thing wrong with that), you're going to call that a flaw.  But I refuse to consider something a flaw when it was so obviously the conscious intention of the film-makers.  You can argue that the approach they took made for a film which is not enjoyable to you, but if they had taken any other approach, they'd have made a different film.  Thus, ambiguity, for instance, can't be considered a flaw of this film.  It's like saying that The Sixth Sense would have been a better movie if it had been about pirates. Anyway, everybody talks about the special effects and the music and blah blah blah.  Everybody talks about the HAL sequence.  Blah blah blah.  I don't want to talk about any of that stuff.  It really diminishes the film, in my opinion, to discuss it like that.  More so than any other, this is a film where each aspect (script, performances, cinematography, music, special effects, etc.) blends together with all the others to create a sort of indivisible whole.  This is the movie equivalent of a prime number.  [God, that sounds pretentious!]  But anyway, discussing singular pieces of the film is to miss the greater effect of the whole.  This film is an experience much more than it is a story, and that experience is created by the confluence of every aspect of the film.  [This is why, incidentally, I think the film works so much better than the book... a novel is, by its very nature, suggestive of a narrative.  The simple procession of words is inherently evocative of a story structure.  A film does not have this limitation, and is therefore able to achieve much more by deviating from the constraints of classical narrative structure, which this film does toward the end.]  Another reviewer here states that if you haven't seen this on the big screen, you haven't seen it all.  I'm afraid I haven't seen it on the big screen.  But I would like to add that if you've only seen this film once, you haven't seen it at all.  A single viewing (or even less) may indeed be enough to convince you that you have no interest in plumbing the depths of this immense and powerful film.  But if you are not instantly alienated by the unconventional aspects of the film, you simply must see it again and again (and also read the book... though inferior, as I said, it is also instrumental to a full appreciation of the film).  If you simply don't like the film, that's fine.  You are far from alone.  I would suggest you check out the book and film 'Contact'.  It is a far more conventional version of practically the same basic story.",10,1,5,16 January 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Challenging
","This is probably the most intellectually challenging film I've ever seen. I'm really not sure I understand more than a handful of what's happening in this film.  I mean, the story is easy enough to follow, and several of the themes become apparent on repeated viewings, but a lot of peculiarities remain.  Much of the supporting cast performs their roles with a high degree of stylized exaggeration.  I'm not sure what Kubrick was going after with all of this.Still, at the very least, it's a damn good film that I really enjoy watching.  But every time I do, I'm thrust back into that dame dilemma.  What does the ending of this film signify?  Clearly, Alex has managed to indulge in thoughts of a highly anti-social nature without being torn apart.  So, the effects of the Ludovico treatment are gone.  So, what now?  The legendary story of the censored final chapter of Burgess's novel has this answer.  To viewers who complain about the abrupt ending, you have government censorship of literature to thank.  I know what Burgess's take on this was, having familiarized myself with the true ending of the story.  But what is Kubrick's take?  What does Kubrick think he is saying with this film?  Has Alex learned something from his ordeal?  It looks like he has not, in which case, the only point of the film seems to be that it is better to be free and evil than a good slave.  On this level, the film is more relevant now, in this age of personality- altering drugs people take for depression or ADD.  Is complete loss of self to high a price to pay for the elimination of undesirable behavior?The film is an excellent jumping off point for the topic of criminal justice.  Specifically, what is the purpose of incarceration?  Do we imprison criminals in order to protect society from them?  To reform them? Or to have revenge upon them?  It's a particularly fascinating question here in America, since the Death Penalty is still a very living issue for us. You can find in this film loads of material to fuel an energetic discussion on the topic.  But again, I'm at a loss to understand what the driector had in mind.  It doesn't concern me.  This film is thought-provoking.  When I watch it, or even think on it, my mind spirals off into all sorts of issues raised by it. I don't know which issues, or which positions, the director intended to support, if any.  And I don't care.  It is enough, in my view, that the film provokes thought and discussion.  Added to that, it is simply an enjoyable film to watch, with an intriguing (if slowly developed) story.  The structure of the film is beautiful. Slowly, patiently, it builds up an intimate portrait of Alex's pre-prison life.  Then, slowly and patiently, it takes us with Alex through prison, through the Ludovico treatment, and to his eventual release.  Then, in the third act, it slowly and patiently takes us back again through his previous crimes.  Encounters with his parents, with his former friends, and with his former victims tell another story.  The one thing that I do think the film is saying, quite clearly, is that people have a natural, emotional desire for animalistic revenge.  Toss out the high-minded theories we were discussing earlier.  When we hurt, we need to make someone else hurt worse.   As usual, a very dark, pessimistic film about the terrible flaws in human nature.",10,1,3,27 February 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," One of the best ever
","I'm pleased to add my name to the chorus of praise this film has garnered here.  It is truly one of the best films of all time, and I never tire of seeing it.  I'm actually a little surprised, though.  I was expecting to see far more negative comments about this film.  Of the comments I read, the only negative ones were from due to historical inaccuracies.  I've said before, the historical accuracy of an historical film has no bearing whatsoever on my judgment of the film, but I understand where these people are coming from.  But anyway, I kinda thought there would be a minority of people chiming in claiming the film to be boring.  Don't get me wrong, I personally find it riveting.  But, as I watched it the other day, it occurred to me that a lot of modern viewers might indeed find it boring, especially if they've been told things like 'It's the best war film ever!' and are walking into it with visions of 'Saving Private Ryan' in their head.  Because, regardless of what the people here say, this is NOT a war film.  It takes place during a war, and includes characters who are fighting a war, yes.  But that's all.  War is a setting for the dramatic conflicts of the film (and there are many).  But the conflict of the war is not one of the conflicts of this film.  We've got Saito vs. Nicholson, Shears vs. Nicholson, Clipton vs. Nicholson, Shears vs. Warden, Warden vs. Nicholson.  These are the conflicts. Conflicts between men, not armies or nations.  Sure, the war is an everpresent element in the background of this film, but that's all it is. The fate of the bridge is not the meat of this movie.  The important thing here is the conflicts between the characters.  Nicholson's dignity vs. Saito's authority.  Shears's pragmatism vs. Nicholson's duty, or Warden's grim heroism.  And each of them, in their own way, vs. Clipton's simple human compassion.  That's what the film is about.  The bridge provides a focal point.  It is a motivating factor to all of the characters, in one way or another (except Clipton).  It is a metaphor, a visible, tangible representation for the various struggles at work between the main characters.The film's only major weakness is in the performance of William Holden, which is simply not up to the standard of the others.  I honestly am not familiar with his work (this is the only film of his I have seen), but in this movie he is poor.  He sticks out like a sore thumb... the Hollywood star amid a company of actors.  Unfortunately, much of the film rests on his shoulders, especially in the second half, and he just can't carry it.  In a lesser movie, you'd never notice, but in one as excellent as this, it's a crippling weakness.  And it's such a shame.  Nevermind.  This is still an excellent movie, a timeless classic that deserves to live forever.  9.5/10",10,0,2,19 February 2002
Any Given Sunday," Stone is judged by a different standard
","Any Given Sunday has come under lots and lots fire from plenty of people for all sorts of reasons.  Some people don't like the style in which the football sequences were shot because it obscures the action.  [Guess what, the action isn't the point!] What bugs me about this film's criticism is that some people, not the least of which is Leonard Maltin, say that the film has too little substance. The editor reviews at Amazon.com say that the film's only interesting points are about race relations, and that it is bogged down by obvious and simplistic comparisons between football players and gladiators.  Ok, you know what? I'll buy that.  But remember what we're talking about.  We're criticizing a film because what it has to say isn't interesting enough.  Compare that to the ridiculous acclaim garnered by The Sixth Sense, a film that has practically nothing to say at all, except perhaps something staggeringly banal like 'Live for today, because you might die tomorrow.'  Compare this also to American Beauty, which does have a lot to say.  Just not nearly as much as it thinks it does.People judge Oliver Stone by a different set of standards.  With most films, having a 'point' is a rare and unnecessary bonus. With Oliver Stone, everyone whines if the point he has isn't quite up to his previous standards.  You can only make Platoon once.  You can only make Wall Street once.  This time, he made Any Given Sunday.  So maybe it's not as good as JFK, but it beats the living crap out the The Replacements.  Perspective, people.  Perspective.Any Given Sunday is a film that knows what it is.  It's not out to change the world, it's out to tell a terrific story, which it does.  [I normally loathe sports movies because they are so predictable.  This one had just enough elements to keep it interesting, so I didn't mind the predictability.]  It does have something to say, but it knows (unlike American Beauty) that it's nothing revolutionary.  So, it neatly avoids seeming pretentious (unlike American Beauty).Bottom line: strong story, excellent characters, great performances, stunning direction, strong script.  This film is not one of the absolute greats of all time.  But it is significantly better than 90% of the crap that gets thrown at us every day.  Significantly better.",9,0,2,6 September 2000
Braveheart," Great, but over-rated
","This is not, repeat not, the greatest film of all time.  I'm sorry, it just isn't.  My advice, to everyone who maintains that it is, is to immediately go out and see 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Spartacus', two other historical war epics which each have far more depth than 'Braveheart'.  If you still say 'Braveheart' is better, then we can disagree amicably, but I can't take seriously anyone who trumpets 'Braveheart' without having seen its ancestors.  What bothers me about this film is its simplicity.  But I mentioned in another comment that simplicity and power go hand in hand, and this is definitely a powerful movie.  But for me, its that same simplicity that prevents 'Braveheart' from being elevated to the level of a true cinematic classic.  The villain in 'Braveheart', Edward the Longshanks, is a one-note villain. He is an interesting character (villains usually are), but he is simply evil.  There are no shades of grey there.  Compare to the villain of 'Spartacus', Crassus, portrayed by Laurence Olivier.  Here is an infinitely more complex character.  Crassus is a character for whom the audience can feel a degree of sympathy, even when siding against him.  It's impossible to feel sympathy for Longshanks.  The man is not human.But then again, it's the simplicity that makes the film powerful.  The audience feels a deep and stomach-churning hatred for Longshanks, which is important.  That hatred is an important motivating factor. 
Now look at the hero.  William Wallace is uncompromisingly good.  No matter how vicious he is in battle, how brutal in war, we know that his motivations are utterly noble.  There is a level of historical inaccuracy here, I'm sure.  His principle that the nobles exist to provide the people with freedom is, I think, a highly anachronistic political principle.  But nevermind.  I hate people who quibble about historical accuracy in films. It's a movie, not a history lesson.  Anyway, compare to the hero in 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  He is in a similar position, and has similar goals.  But that turns a very critical eye toward all the violence involved in achieving freedom, and a very critical eye toward Lawrence himself.  Again, 'Braveheart' lacks this depth. 
Lack of depth is not such a terrible criticism of a film, not when the story, shallow as it may be, is so strong.  And not when the performances are so strong, and the direction is so strong.  But when people are talking about the greatest film of the 20th century, as many people here are claiming this to be, I think there needs to be a higher standard at work than that.  The bottom line is that 'Braveheart' is an excellent and highly entertaining film.  Despite its length, it is riveting from beginning to end (except that denouement, which is a little drawn out there at the end).  It is an emotional monster, getting right into your guts and kicking the wind out of you again and again.  The supporting cast is wonderfully.  The political intrigue going on is fascinating.  But, this is not the best ever. For me, it would probably fall somewhere in the lower half of my personal top 100 list, if I ever bothered to compile one.  I give it 7.5/10.",9,1,4,15 February 2002
Born on the Fourth of July," Don't overlook the story
","You've heard the express 'can't see the forest for the trees', right?  It refers to someone who gets so caught up in details, they miss the big picture.  Reading other comments on IMDb regarding 'Born on the Fourth of July', I think people have the opposite problem with this film.  So many people seem to get caught up in talking about Vietnam, war, Nixon, America, Communism, and hippies, that they totally overlook Ron Kovic. 
Ron Kovic is the center of this film.  In 'Platoon', war was the center, and the central character (Charlie Sheen's Chris Taylor) was merely a POV character through whose eyes we could see war.  Not so in 'Born on the Fourth of July'.  Vietnam is the setting, the context, and the backdrop. But Ron Kovic is the story.  Oliver Stone really understands a character arc.  Look at Kovic's life, where it starts, where it ends.  The film is the journey, how he got from A to B.  It is a dramatization of a life, as opposed to an actual life, but it still rings true.  It feels true.  It reaches an artistic level of truth, even if some literal truths are overlooked, distorted, or rearranged. That's what Stone is trying to do.  People who quibble about the facts miss the point.  (This is a theme I will take up again when I review some of Stone's other films, as Stone is constantly being bashed for historical inaccuracies.)  The connections from one point to the next work admirably, and the progression is completely believable, which is quite a feat for such a dramatic change of attitude (compare to 'American History X', where the main character goes through a similar about face with scant motivation). 
Anyway, what impresses me about this film is the honesty and respect with which Stone presents the opposing views of the film.  Say what you want about Stone's political beliefs, but the argument in this film is presented in a very neutral light.  It's a story about Kovic's choices, Kovic's politics, Kovic's judgments.  And the anti-Vietnam beliefs he finally supports in the final act are a very natural and believable outcome of the story.  This film isn't anywhere near as didactic as some people like to imagine.  The tragedy of Oliver Stone is that, because he has been so edgy, so controversial, so deliberately provocative, no one can really just sit down and, with a neutral eye, watch his films.  They have become so burdened by this giant, irrelevant, political squabble.  The films have been subsumed by the very issues they sought to raise.  And it's a shame, with this film especially, because it is excellent.  Tom Cruise gives possibly the greatest performance of his career (I can't think of anything that tops it, though his performance in 'Eyes Wide Shut', for very different reasons, is just as remarkable).  The script is fantastic, taking time where it needs to take time, but not overly deliberate in its approach.  It's very economical with time.  It knows what each scene needs to say, and says it without any excess baggage, wasted space, or dead time.  The direction is excellent, as is the editing and cinematography.  The supporting cast is excellent.  But this movie would be nothing without the remarkable, heart-rending, true story of Ron Kovic.  So, while we admire the technical achievement of the film, while we debate the points raised, while we enshrine or excoriate the director (as the case may be), let's not forget the story.  Let's not get so fired up about Vietnam that we forget Ron Kovic.  He is the heart and soul of this film.  One final note:  I bristle when people call this an anti-war film.  That really diminishes it, I think.  It's so much more than that.  It's not just saying that war is brutal, nasty, and horrific.  It's saying something far more specific about a specific war, and about the effect of that war on a specific man.",9,73,89,14 February 2002
All the President's Men," Tense, Brilliant, and Endlessly Watchable
","I'm a Watergate junkie.  I admit it.  In fact, I'm a Nixon junkie.  So, obviously, I love this movie to bits.  But apart from feeding my thirst for Watergate, this also happens to be a very well-made film.The script is marvellous, for instance.  There is some really great dialogue in here, and the focus is much broader than simply Watergate.  I was watching the film the other day and noting with admiration the way the film provides its own historical context so well.  There they are, discussing the very ABM treaty that our current president has just decided to scrap.  The fact that the script takes such pains to make the viewer aware of what are the 'big stories' at the Post (especially before the Watergate story becomes a big story itself) add immensely to the realism the picture.  Why would the Foreign Editor, for instance, care about Watergate.  He wouldn't, and in this film, he doesn't.  But he doesn't act like the minor character he so obviously is.  In those meetings, he's a major character.  Think about it... if you were the Foreign Editor at the Post, you'd probably think and act like a major character too.  It's details like that... making sure a character behaves as his real-world counterpart might, even when it doesn't directly serve the story, that makes this picture so much broader than Watergate.Because at root, it isn't about Watergate.  It's about Woodward and Bernstein's investigation of Watergate.  Huge difference.  The important details become, not setting the context of the White House where these things happened, but setting the context of the Post where the investigation took place.  The story of Watergate can be told in many ways (there have been some great documentaries, and Stone's 'Nixon' touches on the subject), but this is the only way to tell the story of the 'Woodstein' invesitgation.It's easy to praise this film by talking about how important it is, but I think many reviewers often fail to mention just how good a movie it really is.",9,4,8,14 January 2002
