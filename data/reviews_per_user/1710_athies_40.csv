Raiders of the Lost Ark," OMG, stone carving!
","What a good idea... tasting poison. Just like police tasting for drugs.He didn't see Harrison throw back the whip? He had an enormous amount of time to shoot.All Indiana Jones movies MUST have cobweb curtains.Love the shredded pant leg cuffs.The dust flying off his jacket as they galavant over the rolling hills is a good touch.How did they fit everyone in that plane there? More importantly how did he not notice the snake on the way in? How does Jock have no accent? Funny meaningless eye lid stunt. I guess it sets up Dr. Jones as a popular professor? Love the tome with latches.Caustiouly throwing a pistol into a suitcase.There's Death reading Life.I'm sure you could get more than $3k for the prop nowadays.Who picks up anything in that manner? Why is this guy still fighting after his buddies tried to kill him? It's a date.Desert pirate! I love when Salla breaks into needless song.'Bad dates' :) That must have been an unplanned tumble.No reason for the diggers to hold back other than Indy wanted to take a moment? He shouldn't discard his costume while providing a nice silhouette.Watch your toes! Heels in the sand. Very practical.Be a man and drink.Greatest hanger scene ever... 'what shoulder talk about'.... super creepy.Creep-o is a bitter kid who never got laid.Wrench fighter is terrible. The pilot is oblivious.Marion is no joke. Progressive for now and very progressive for then (when this was released) let alone the time of the setting.That fuel trust was bursting with fuel. No fuel container is going to pop like that when he cap comes off.Great punch sounds.Iconic sprint.'I'm so pleased you're not dead' :) Why do angry at the truck? Slack-jawed local on the hood.Bumped off into a painting... Ahh! Good German boots.German's hate fruit.Something very official about the course plotter.The classic Indy spin.Of course.Poor Marion, always dragged around in a white dress.Do they really need standard bearers?

I give this movie 4 stars just for that joke.Love Ned's questions, but I would be really annoyed if I were Peter, but hey, his carelessness means he has to keep Ned on his side.Just because it is 'Captain America's Fitness Challenge' does not make it any less lame.Who is this 'your lame' girl? I bet she knows who Peter is.Ned's hat is cool. I'd war that.Don't do it Peter! Party on a school night!? Outrageous!

","Let's get right to it.I like her treatment of the bug.Somebody's angry... and for once I have a feeling it's justified.I hadn't noticed everyone leaves their car windows open often in films.The advertising 'manager' has some balls.

That is a scene! Who would'a thought reading a letter could be some action packed.Ha!

Bird Box," Talk about strict...

And judges books by their cover. His wife must have been quite positive.Maybe a reflection helps? Ever heard of Medusa? Too bad you don't have a shield.It might behoove you to grow long hair. It might say you from peripheral vision death.I wanna be on Trevante's team.Checking all the windows in Safeway is gonna take awhile.'You're only saying that cause we're all gonna die'... another great line.That is skillful driving to blindly enter the garage.I like this back and forth more than a catch-up.Two pregnant women but where are the blind?Tying down in a boat? I dunno if that is a good idea here.From one reviewer... 'Never quite reaches its intriguing potential...' - FU,10,5,14,26 December 2018

Van Helsing," Why do these people stay?!
",Filthy friar.Hiding the non-decoy so close? It's like 10 feet away? How did they not see it? This illusion is greater than David Copperfield making the Statue of Libery disappear. This party looks like the Yahoo! company Xmas party. Complete with stilts. Sun Bomb... 'A genius with access to unstable chemicals' :)No one ever enters a mirror faster than very slow. That must take all night to light all those torches. '... never be the first to stick your hand in a viscous material.' :)The wives never learn to not play with their food. Throwing it is a horrible plan... if you did not know you were in a movie. Anna definitely needs to enter concussion protocol. Repeatedly. Anna has a remarkably high constitution. Hugh handed his clothes over to James Purefoy for Solomon Kane. Highly Rewatchable.,8,1,2,4 August 2018
American History X," Excellent Movie
","Why do people only believe traumatic events push you towards the dark side in movies, but when a movie portrays a traumatic event pushing the character in a good way they refuse to believe it. Edward Norton's character has plenty of time to think in prison, and this takes three years - that is not quick at all. Prison gives you nothing but time to think. Of course we are not going to see every nuance of his change of mind over those three years, just the key moments. If you want to talk about a movie where a character makes a total chance towards race in a very short amount of time see Monster's Ball. Other review say Edward Norton's character transforms to a lover of all races. I do not see this at all. He becomes tolerant, at least to the point of being quiet. I believe silent hatred is the first step towards racial unity. This is flat out an excellent movie.",10,0,0,5 August 2002
Avengers: Endgame," There is gonna be a LOT of anger in this movie.

The Dirty Dozen," First movie of this era I've seen that doesn't have many unnecessary long pauses...
",An indoor hanging room?Really snap to are these prisoners :)Why is he not reading their crimes? Surely that is more interesting that their sentence. Or how about their military skill?What is 30 years imprisonment vs 30 years hard labor really? Busting rocks?Good idea with the credits over the line up.Why are some smiling?!They would never let ELEVEN do that.The 'P' on their back are ridiculous.What's with the name Maggot?What the hell is with the sergeant's baseball talk?!That's what passes for double quick? Pathetic.You don't want Jim Brown and Charles Bronson meeting you in a dark alley.I'm with Chuck. I wouldn't say that either.Is this suddenly Stripes?This bully is being dubbed.This was definitely before me too.Why not tell the guitar player to make himself useful.Dancing with a nice cigarette in the face.The major really doesn't give a rat's ass about his superiors. He definitely manages down. He would not fair well in corporate America.He calls the sergeant for more ice!There are a LOT of yellow teeth amongst these officers.Does a rolling tire count as a good segue in 1967? That horrible.For a general he looks away an awful lot. Ernest you disappoint.Jim Brown really shouldn't point his gun at Donald while in a bumpy truck.In reality they wouldn't be laughing in a general's face.Put the gate down behind you.I hate Maggot.The guy shot on the roof totally rolled from the second to the ground floor himself.You better hurry up.,8,0,1,29 April 2020

",What is up with this dumpster crew?Is that plywood his mark?30 minutes and nothing yet.Now this Kato scene might be interesting.Those are some dirty feet.How rude putting your bare feet up on his card.Let's see old George... Something interesting about to happen I expect.VelveetaF-n punks.Not much going on but it is interesting.So that is when you'd see people at Weinerschnitzel.'Real as a donut...'...

That didn't take long.I don't think the Colonel orders you to fire.Come in an f-up a peaceful place so when the place defends itself you can freak out and try to kill it. Go to hell.Body blow.Why do they fly so close? Idiots. Did you not hear the Icarus story 5 minutes ago? The one that says Bad M*th3r F^#3r.Taco Afro-scientist you are zero help.That's right Riley.
