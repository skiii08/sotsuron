Marie Antoinette," Pretty scenery, not much substance
","OK, so it had a bit of historical accuracy if not tons (the scene of Marie Antoinette trying on shoes and having a pair of sneakers laying on the floor comes to mind), but my biggest problem with the movie was the lack of substance. The movie focused on Marie's early life and lost out on what might have been the best chance for substance in dealing with the change of a young girl coming to a foreign court as queen and how she matured from a frivolous young princess to a devoted mother. Instead, the later years of her life where she actually had something to contribute to the world were just sort of glossed over.The scenery was pretty, the use of modern music interesting, but for the most part it was all eye candy and no substance at all.",5,2,3,10 May 2007
