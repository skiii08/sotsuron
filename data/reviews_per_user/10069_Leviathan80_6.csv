Insidious: Chapter 2," Great!!
","I saw some families bringing small kids for the movie, they kept screaming throughout. My friend was scared too. The 'ghosts' or whatever was a lot freakier than I thought. And the movie was funny too! Lastly, I find it amazing that both the director and the composer acted in the movie. You have to watch this, this is better than all the other horror movies this year. It is better than Insidious 1 and 2 because it had none of the irritating parents. I liked the dysfunctional family and touching drama. And the actors who were really good and young--these are real teenagers portraying teens. So all in all, well done directors!",Null,0,1,28 November 2015
It Follows," Good movie
","This isn't going to be a long review. It doesn't need to be. Premise- after an odd encounter, 'it' is now following Jamie. What is 'it', what does 'it' want? Maybe you'll find out, maybe you won't. Here's what I can tell you. The most effective soundtrack in a film in the past 10 years. Incredible cinematography, performances were understated in a way, but in a very good way that adds to the eerie ness of the whole film. The entire 100 minute run time had a claustrophobic feeling that makes you always wonder where 'it' is. I can't think of a single thing I would do differently if this were my movie. 10/10. If you are looking for a horror film that won't disappoint you, this is it.",8,3,5,28 November 2015
Insidious," Promising start but intensity spoiled half way through by unoriginal tropes and poorly conceived images.
","Insidious is one of those movies I avoided. I don't jump on fads. I am very hipster when things don't fit into my nerd realm. That goes hardcore for movies. Insidious was one of those scary movies that came out and blew up. I hated this trend of the next scary movie banking at the box office when my idea of real horror was passed over. It seemed like every year there was a new scary movie or a sequel to a new scary movie. They were all a year or two years apart. Have to bank on that hype right? Right from the start I was going in with a negative sense of view. But I thought that if I was watching it then there was something about it that appealed to me. The film stars Patrick Wilson and Rose Bryne as loving parents who start experiencing odd occurrences in their new home. When the events escalate they move to a new house and realize there is something more involved. It's a haunted house story with a 'twist'. From the start of the film you can tell even with the budget James Wan as a director is talented.It is the exact duo that brought us the Saw franchise. James Wan is behind the lens with Leigh Whannell writing and acting. Technically the film looks great. There are some inventive shots and the ending haunt is staged very well. But the story feel like it's been done before. There are all sorts of elements from multiple haunted house films. If a film could be called a mash up I would give this film that title. Wilson and Bryne do their best with that they have. The story fails them. When things start to ramp up everything of the why is explained by a newly emerged character.There is a back story to why this is all happen. This is not explained until nearly the end of the film. It's newly introduced characters that wrap up everything in a nice tight package. Some of the back story is shown but not much. It would have been nice if these piece of the story were scattered throughout the entire film. I wasn't really scared as the 'boo' scares weren't stage that well. It was more of putting things for the audience to jump instead of building tension. The most entertaining and well executed sequence was the ending.There was a nice twist at the end that on it's own would have sat very well. But knowing that there is a sequel comes off as strategically place for a sequel to be made. There is just too much hype surround this film and for me it didn't (never had the chance) to live up to it. Seeing Sinister and The Conjuring (from James Wan) I know there are good haunted house films out there that live up to the hype. I can only describe this film with a quote taken from a user on Reddit, 'I think the reason so many people like it and praise it is because it is so bland; it feels safe. It's the movie the average moviegoer can go to, not get too scared, but still say that they love a horror movie.' Well said.",5,0,0,28 November 2015
Sinister," Sinister is very unsettling and definitely left with me.
","I am usually disappointed when I see a film which came with very high expectations. However, I must make an exception to 'Sinister.' I had heard very good things about this film making it a must-see for a horror movie fan like me. However, I had to be out of the country during the days it was shown in the theaters locally last month, so I only got to watch it now. And these high expectations were fulfilled. 'Sinister' is indeed a very good horror film. In fact, I will go on to say that it was one of the best American horror films ever made.Ellison (Ethan Hawke in his first appearance in a horror film) is an author of true crime novels who is seeking to follow up his one hit book. He moves his family into the very home where a gruesome family massacre had previously taken place. When he discovers a box of film reels which turned out to be video footage documenting the deaths of several families, his research turns into a real life horror for him and his family.The eerie and tense atmosphere is set up from the very first scene where we see four people hanging from a tree. It never let up from there up to the bloody end. OK, there are horror clich√©s here like the house in seemingly perpetual darkness, or the sudden scares that lead nowhere, creepy children drawing on walls, and so on, but in this movie, these things actually work well to work up the audience's heart rates and goosebumps. The music is pulsating as it is unsettling, very effective to work you up some more with every step that Ellison takes in the house.I liked the way that the gore was suggested instead of blatant. I liked the subtlety of many of its scare moments. I liked the way that Ethan Hawke realistically portrayed the tormented but desperate Ellison. A male protagonist is not always as easy to play in a horror film than a female one. I like the ending, how it may seem that you can figure out what is going to happen in the end, but the way it played out was pretty out-of-the-box disturbing and ultimately, shocking. I highly recommend horror film fans to watch 'Sinister.' It is as it is entitled.",6,0,0,28 November 2015
The Conjuring," Pleasantly surprised
","The Conjuring, a 2013 horror film directed by James Wan was based on the true events recorded by Ed and Lorraine Warren in the 1970's. The story sees a family experience supernatural occurrences shortly after they move into a new farmhouse. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson put forth a fantastic performance playing the Warrens alongside Lilli Taylor and Ron Livingston who played Carolyn and Rodger Perron.Usually I have no real interest in watching films that are based on 'true events' as most seem to be overly dramatic and obviously fake. However, The Conjuring is by far my favorite horror film of 2013, the storyline was far-fetched (a witched who cursed the land possess the mother to kill the child) but at the same time was made to be very believable, I think this is partly because of all the marketing that the film put forth before release, these included 3 trailers and a featurette, which included the real family that the case studies where based on and an interview with Lorraine Warren. Most films that happen to be based on true events always turn out to be a hoax, Paranormal Activity for example claimed to be based on actual experiences when it was first brought out but then carried on to make numerous films and killed the original buzz of it being 'real'. Although, The Conjuring sequel that is being talked about may actually, like Paranormal Activity, ruin the 'buzz' if the storyline carried out to much.There was a big focus on the Annabelle doll that featured in a few of the trailers and the opening scene of the movie. I must criticize the movie on this note because I think that this was really irrelevant, I know that there is talk for a spin off film based around the Annabelle doll but again I think this how no real relevance to the film itself. All in all I think the film is definitely worth a watch if you're a thrill seeker and love a good horror film! Thumbs up to James Wan on this film!",9,2,3,28 November 2015
The Cabin in the Woods," Mr. Lilcookie's Spoiler Free Advise on whom should watch this
",the first thing that i will say is that this film is very unique and is sort of a parody or homage to almost every genre of horror films ever made. You can not really take this film seriously. It is a parody but it is not the kind of Parody where its all funny and has tons of stupid jokes in it. It is a serious film but you could still see obvious nods to other films. I am not a big fan of horror films. i have not seen many but i saw this one because it is such a unique film and i'm getting bored of seeing films that are obviously made to be like a film that has already been made. You don't have to be a fan of horror films. you could be like me where u don't care for horror films. you should see this one because it is so original and because it has very strange plot twists. I personally dislike most horror films but like i said this is not really a horror film at all. it is a parody of them.,8,1,3,28 November 2015
