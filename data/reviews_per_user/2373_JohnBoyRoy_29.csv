Scarface," Live fast, get rich - then f*ck it all right up!
","Brian De Palma's excellent 'Scarface' has been misinterpretted by many people as a story of one man's 'rise to the top', but really it is about his self destruction.Pacino just gains this destruction by getting rich and powerful on the way.The editing of the picture and the cinematography is professionally excellent and very dynamic.  De Palma uses some brilliant crane shots in particular - they're really intriging to watch.The editing allows us to see Tony work his way from small time imigrant up to big time crime lord.  The thing is that what he really wants to be - legitimate - is never going to happen.From the moment he murders a political prisoner for a green card we know that he is a right c*nt!  Some viewers would root for him as an anti-hero; I would say that he is an idiot - because I know that he's going to get himself killed from the beggining.By the end of the flick (spoilers!) he has managed to become a crack head, a public drunk, a drug pusher, killed his best mate ever, destroyed his sister and mother, failed in his marriage and never fathered a child.  Well done son - what a loser!To his merit he finally realises that everything he has was worthless, and the opposites of the previous list are what its all about; but by this stage his house is under siege and he's about to get his bum blown out with a double barelled shotgun.  Good!Pacino is allowed to overact with so much charm its infectious, the action scenes are top notch and the sense of danger is perfick!  A great crime-does-not-pay film.Check out the DefJam documentary on the DVD to see how idiotic some rapper are (Puff 'I've seen it 63 times' Daddy still doesn't get it?!!! Come on lads, get with the plot!).In the words of myself ; bloody marvellous little film.  Put it on your to see list.",8,4,7,12 April 2004
Alien 3," Re-born on DVD as a classic sequel
","The original theatrical cut of this film, as many have already stated, was a disappointment to fans of the original two films. However, 'Alien 3' is not a forgotten film due to it's re-release on the DVD format in which it emerges as a classic film from an on form David Fincher.If 'ALien' was birth, 'Aliens' was Life, then 'Alien 3' is all about death. THe tone of the picture is all melancholy and gritty. The characters are a bunch of paedophs, murderers and possibly cat rapists if they put them in prison, I dunno. In this sense we don't really care what happens to them and are extra stressed about the whole thing because Ripley has to worry about unwanted 'bloodsports' as well as the Alien creature.The casting is perfect though, with a great ensemble of thesps to keep the feeling of genuinely and respectability going.The new DVD edition is a longer film and adds some more dimensions to the alien lifecycle, offers a much more tragic element to the part of the story involving trying to capture the creature, and adds some more iconic visuals with a new opening sequence. THe intended epic nature of the film is only visible in this cut and should be the only one viewed really.Very frightening with no 'action for actions sake'. Remember one thing - this is not a film trying to top CAmeron's effort or replicate Scott's - it is a decidedly down beat Fincher version of the world created in the first tow films.6/10 Theatrical 8/10 DVD re-release with re inserted scenes",9,1,5,19 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Would be a 9 if it wasn't for Jam Jar
","The critical backlash against this marvellous entry into the Star Wars series is what is known as unfounded favouring of nostalgia, a refusal to advance forwards and being a bunch of knob cheeses.Apart from the annoying JarJar Binks, Episode I is an incredible film, grand in scale and spectacle, introducing and elegant and historic - rather than futuristic - feel to Star Wars, additionally offering some great new characters.The style of the film is different to the originals in the sense that the effects, a main element of the saga, through the undeniable naturalism have lost the unique 80s style that fans have come to love over the years. Once the new trilogy is complete, however, I'm sure that a massive U-Turn will occur and suddenly Episiodes i-iii will be declared a new masterpiece.Think about it - does the original trilogy really have a better script than the new trilogy? The answer is no, the dialogue will always be simple and clich√©d (that is the way Lucas works). This, as some may disagree, is the deliberate - this is a fairy tale after all.The introduction of Darth Maul is the highlight of the story, his appearance before the stunning climactic light saber duel the veritable money shot of the piece.Somebody please re-cut this film without JarJar Binks and then I can rate it a nine.",7,0,1,11 May 2005
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I should be in the nines!
","Firstly, I cant believe that poor old E.T. isn't getting a better showing in the rankings than the high sevens - its a beautiful gem of a film and deserves to be at least a high eight.Anyway, this is one of those films made by Spielberg that helps to cement his status as the premiere fairy tale teller of all (film) time.The simple premise that not all aliens want to rip out our spines of lay chest bursters inside us a kill all our friends is a concept that has not been returned to since (apart from the dismal Cocoon).This is probably because nobody will ever be able to recreate the intense emotional journey that Spielberg has portrayed.  THe heart wrenching scenes between Elliot and E.T. at the end of the film will go to prove the exqisitely realised genuinity of the love and friendship that develops and actually exists (I mean that Henry Thomas - ELiiot - came to love the puppet as if he were real) is what makes everything in life worth it.Full of warm moments, clever touches and humour, E.T. is an absolutely essential watch for all fim fans.Timeless. 9/10",8,36,65,8 May 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Better left forgotten
","This is an un-necessary sequel to a trilogy that was better left alone after part three. THe whole thing is done in a comic book style and so stands out from the naturalistic attitudes of the other films.One reason to watch would be to witness the ALiens as fully realised CGI creatures - they are very impressive on land but weaker in the water scenes, looking a tad fake.The series has become a bit tired by this point (Alien-human hybrids - no thanks, that is, unfortunately, sh*t and not scary) and Weaver looks bored in the role.Ron 'Naughty Nick Nolte' Perlman is Great in it though! Overall a waste of time and money that should have been put towards a decent 'Predator' sequel methinks.Tosh but semi-entertaining: 5/10.",5,0,1,19 May 2004
Troy," Ashley Cotton and the sons of Troy dress to impress!
","This is a sterling effort at the epic genre by legendary 'Never Ending Story' helmer, Wolfgang Peterson. First and foremost, the casting of the film is expertly done, with all of the best actors that come to mind cast so that blood ties become perfectly believable indeed.Brian Cox may get a gong or two for his deliciously despicable portrayal of Agammenon that is so evil and conceited the audience - and a British one at that - cheered when he was killed.The cinematography is absolutely stunning and their are some brilliant wide-angle sweeps over the battles that bring the story to brutal realistic life. One problem with the battles, however, is that the close up work lacks continuity and appears like a sort of 'highlights' clips package.THe sets, costumes and style of the film cannot be faulted really. THere were some greeks next to me in the cinema and they all seemed perfectly happy to gasp and whoop in all the right places.There is a camp-factor about it all, with the guys getting their bums out all of the time and a particularly homo-erotic sparring session between Achilles (a brilliant, on form Pitt) and his cousin where they giggle like little girls, fighting with a veritable 'Ohh, smack my bum and I'll hit yours harder' attitude. That's before Bean shows up to break it up and talk some man-sense! He's great and steals the show as usual. Eric Bana is so much harder than Achilles - he's a natural warrior, whereas Achilles is a gods-blessed cheat - and their final battle was one of the most excruciatingly tense one-on-ones I've ever seen.Lovely music that sounds like a combination of Gladiator and Titanic. An absolutely essential blockbuster for 2004. 7.5/10WARNING: This film is completely ruined at the climax when 'Eastender's Ashley Cotton appears for a cameo. Please shut eyes when Paris releases the sword of Troy or the entire film experience is undermined and destroyed. Thanks.",7,0,1,18 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Fitting but flawed final instalment
","Only now does George Lucas feel ready to invest in a more adult representation of his Star Wars Universe. Back in the 80s his creative influence over Kasdan extended to the introduction of some hairy little gimps called Ewoks.This however, remains my only real complaint about the additional characters in the film. Its not that the Ewoks are unlikable or insipid - but the fact that these little bears are capable of defeating hardened Storm Troopers with a twig hit to an armoured bonce. This is a narrative complaint, as the characters and their environment of the Ewok village actually lend quite an evocative atmosphere to the Endor scenes - especially the saccharine sweet closing sequence.Personally speaking I think that Han Solo should have died for his friends in this one. Not only would it have added the element of tragedy that made 'Empire so great, but made the Rebels quest for freedom all the more poignant. It all seems far too convenient that the only people we see loose their lives are some unknown rebel pilots. The most emotional moment remains the point at which Darth Vader decides that love for his son is far greater than his desire for power over the galaxy and decides to lob the Palpatine down a power shaft that engineers (disobeying intergalactic health and safety law) had placed in the Emperor's lounge room. The score helps the tears well sufficiently at this point, as Anakins story reaches full-circle.The special effects are second to none, their combination of sophistication and simplicity becoming a unique style of its own. Highlights include the Battle of Endor (the space part of it) and the final showdown between father and son (quite a Freudian moment for all you psychology nerds out there).A brilliant, yet slightly immature end, to the saga. Some fun moments:1)Luke hiding ridiculously close to Vader and not getting noticed. 2)Han Solo surviving a Wembley Stadium sized explosion by hiding behind a log. 3)The Emperor gloating that the rebels are losing the space battle despite the ships being far too small to actually see who is winning. 4)Some one shouting 'Die Dickheads' as the Super Star Destroyer crashes.",7,0,1,10 May 2005
Alien," A landmark, a quality landmark
","Scott's 1979 'Alien' is one of the most emotionally manipulative films out there.  It is more horror than science fiction, mainly because the technology in the film is actually plausable and believable at the very least.When watching 'Alien' again for it's special edition release at the cinema I actually found myself afraid at moments I had seen time and time again, such is the strength of the tension created in the film.The Alien creature's life cycle seems second nature to most film fans now, but it must have been fascinating to see first time round.  Such is the modern-day legend created by the film that I was already partially aware of what I'd be seeing before I watched the film, even as a ten year old.THis is a great piece of cinema, shot elegantly and with plenty of twists and turns to keep horror, sci-fi and drama fans happy for a couple of tense hours.  Don't let the entire hour of 'build up' fool you-keep watchin and you're in for a hell of a ride!",9,0,1,19 May 2004
Lost in Translation," Sometimes films are a form of rehab...
","When a touching and poingnant a film as 'Lost In Translation' is made these days, it immediately faces tow big challenges.The self-proclaimed film 'conosieurs' out there may sweep it aside as too 'mainstream' for its subject matter to be taken seriously; and the casual film goer may not have seen enough Aliens, explosions or Keanu Reeveses in the trailer to warrant a genuine interest.  Of course Mr. Murray is there, but only those with a bit of cultural clout in their mix will pay any attention to that fact (more is the pity).Therein lies the problem.  Myself, I was going to watch Tom Cruise (as Tom Cruise) in 'The Last Samurai'; but it wasn't on at the time.  So I went to see 'Lost In..'  I wish I had chosen it from the start.  Apologies to all concerned.On that day I saw a film that perfectly encaptured the very human emotions that we have all felt - loneliness, rejection, friendship, love and even that weird sensation you get when you arrive in a different time zone - you know, when it all has a sort of cold haze and your eyes feel like they've disconected.It was such an effortless journey, speckled with subtle and warm humour, that I hardly noticed that it had ended and that there was a tear in my eye. Anybody who leaves this film untouched has not really 'been alive' (either that or they are a pathological killer).Mr. Murray was his usual amazing 'Ps. Im not really acting' self (which benefitted the film totally) with the rest of the cast as perfect as they could be.Coppola's script is subtle and well observed and the cinematography is soft and comfortable.  It feels as much like the synthetic cosiness of the hotel in the film as it could do.  Watch it and see for yourselves.I would recommend this film in full confidence that if you are 1% human you will enjoy it.  As the old saying goes, 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' and you will emerge as though all the emotional problems you've ever had (within reason) are put into perspective.Beautiful.  Watch it now.",8,0,1,22 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," We're getting there
","This entry has the dubious task of linking episode I to III (the one we all want to see) as well as introducing some of the key characters from the original trilogy.The Anakin we see in this film is an arrogant teen, skilled but hindered by his outlook. The best moment belongs to Anakin, at the point in which we see hints of Darth Vader, as he decides that the best option to solve the issue of his mothers death is to violently slaughter a load of sand people n cold blood. Top notch. He seems already on his way to inheriting his full-body asthma pump in this one.The special effects, once again, are amazing, although I'm not sure I'm a fan of digital film. Whereas in Episode I the FX seemed natural and part of the overall film frame - integrated - in this episode it all looks a bit too clean. The effects still look slightly pre-rendered (I would have liked to have seen them slightly more 'weathered'). It's a hard concept to explain, see for yourselves.This can't deny the fact that the action scenes are stunning and on an even larger scale than seen in Episode I. The light saber action is lacklustre compared to the previous instalment - in the sense that it is far too short. The Yoda/Dooku battle does make up for this somewhat, and is a genuinely impressive moment for fans.No problems with the CGI yoda, he's great. Mace Windu gets a larger role in this one, and there is a memorable face off between Jango Fett and Obi-Wan (now looking like a Nicky Clarke model with his golden hair and beard).It all seemed a bit soul-less though, we'll see how this changes in Episode III (after all they are meant to be viewed as one film, so we can let George off for now).",7,1,2,11 May 2005
Predator," Pure gold
","One of the best 5 action films of the 1980s and definitely in the running for the best action film tag line, Predator is an absolute treat from start to finish.Of course, if you are a retard of film you'll probably look down on it as disposable rubbish, which it is, but that is the very reason it should be embraced.Because this disposable rubbish is SH*T HOT! COME ON!The ever legendary Arnie is on top form in this one - he looks great, he cracks a few decent one-liners, and the part was tailor made for him so his woodenness doesn't show one little bit.THere are also appearances by Jesse Ventura and Bill Dukes so the 'daddies' quota is filled nicely. It's even got Action Jackson in it too.Brilliant FX and creature work from Stan Winston is amazing. THe alien itself is a beast; intriguing as well as a deadly b*stard in equal measure, hopefully ALien Vs. Predator will go into it's culture in the ways that Predator and the poor sequel have tempted us to wonder just what that may be.Because it's the first film in the 'series' it doesn't suffer from fan-boy syndrome and will stand in its own league as an introduction to a franchise, but a great film in its own right.",8,0,1,6 September 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Perfectly realised story about being friends
","These films stand out amongst all of cinema for technical accomplishent, storyline and formal elements.  They really do have it all - anyone who cannot enjoy them must be too removed from the material to fully appreciate them, or feel that they have to disjoin themselves from everyone who loves or likes the films - just because they can.But that is not what I want to dwell on.  For me 'Fellowship' is the most powerful of the three films because anyone who has ever been part of a group of true mates can relate to the events within the film.'Fellowship' - like Tolkien's book - is basically a 'road story'.  On the journey new bonds are made and tragically broken.  It also has alot to say about different races interactions, and how it is possible to all get on, if hangs-up were hanged up.THe hobbits are naturally friendly creatures and so we sympathise with them straight away.  We bond to Aragorn because he takes up the role of father to Frodo, Boromir becomes the dad of Merry and Pippin with Gandalf as the overseeing grandad that they all look to.  Most importantly of all - they're a bunch of mates who really care for each other.At first its just because they have to, but Jackson reminds us of the mutual bonding by including scenes such as the camping play fighting, Aragorn being calm and thoughtful with Pippin the idiot, or Frodo and Sam stumbbling home after a night on the razzle.When the Fellowship breaks up (this really begins with Gandalf's death) there is a genuine tradgedy.  None of us would like to think our own mates could be taken away from us but if there is a film that encaptures the sadness of such an event then its Fellowship.  The results are truly heart wrenching - and I don't mind sounding like a big girl for saying it.But as Gandalf says 'Hope remains', when we see Aargorn and the lads set out to rescue their caputred friends Merry and Pippin.  Frodo has Sam and Boromir showed his true worth when he gave his life for his boys.And we know, through the strength of the relationships shoen on screen, that one day they might all be together again, which is bloody marvellous really.Yes its a spectacle, yes its got a great storyline, but the essence of FEllowship is in the growing relationship between nine very different people, and how they come to rely on and love each other.See it now.  Its essential viewing.",10,0,1,24 March 2004
The Matrix Revolutions," The best reason to watch this film
","Well, as we all know, the two Matrix sequels were sadly a steaming pile of monkey s**t.  However, there is one good reason to watch part three...I'm not sure of his name but that geezer who leads the Mech defense of, ahem, 'Zion', thinks that by screaming progressively louder he will, infact, kill more sentinels than when he last screamed a bit louder.With this is mind the entire battle sequence becomes a cracking comedy moment.Try it now people (if you have wasted your money on a copy of it) and let's here if you laughed or not.  Feel free to start crying at this film's immense s**tness after you've given this saving grace a go!",4,1,2,21 December 2003
"I, Robot"," Plain and simple, a great blockbuster
","This film is really an update of Blade Runner. It's not in the same vein as that film; where Blade Runner was a gritty noir this is shiny and clean, with a hint of corruption underneath.The actions scenes are noting short of breathtaking, there is some hilarious dialogue and Wil SMith proves himself one again to be the daddy of the blockbuster.The CGI is particularly impressive, but does not lead the story, just enhances it. Sonny is a brilliant character - as impressive both in performance and looks as Gollum from The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.People will resent the comparison with the supposed best sci-fi of all time but they can swivel - it is just as good, but in an alternative way. It takes that films best themes and puts them in a more optimistic rather than throat slittingly depressing light.The twists and turns and little touches of genius are dotted around all over the film, but I won't ruin them if you haven't seen the film yet and are reading my review. I did however, find the reasoning behing the 'rise of the robots' as a bit weak and predictable.See it, you'll be entertained at the very least. If not, you'll probably love it.",8,0,0,26 August 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Bigger, badder, better!
","Obstensiably T2 is a remake of the original film.  It has exactly the same story line and character types, but the entire film is shifted along the scale of grandeur, and some interseting angles are explored.The worst kept movie secret ever (the T-800 is the protector) allows Cameron to examine how the machine responds to humanity once it is able to coexist with us.  The benefit of having a clean learning plate and superior intelligence means, that by the closure of the film, the Terminator is the most 'human' of all of the characters.To his credit Arnold does alot more than just go through the motions in this film, and manages to pull off a highly competent performance with some really poignant touches.  Cameron allowed some of his natural charm to appear on screen this time round - and well done to him for that!The T-1000 is truely the most horrible, atavistically fearful and primally evil villaine EVER in cinema.  He bloody petrified me, especially when I first saw the film years ago.The dialogue is tight and interesting and the actions sequences cement Cameron's position as the king of the genre.Probably the best action epic of all time, and a contender for the best sequel ever.  Amazing.9/10",9,1,1,5 May 2004
Van Helsing," For fans of the classics!
","For anybody who is familiar with the old Universal monster movies Van Helsing is a total roller-coaster, taking all of the aspects that made the vintage films great, and injecting them with LSD, speed and pyro.The CGI, firstly, is at least complete this time, unlike the decidedly PS2 graphics like SCorpion King from the Mummy sequel. Particularly impressive are the werewolf transformations and the vampiric healing abilities.Jackman carries his charisma well across the film, but unfortunately Beckinsale has none of the English charm that Sommers saw in Rachel Weisz - if only she would have done this one for him.The design and shooting of the action sequences is absolutely perfect -everything can be seen in it's full glory - it's all physically plausible (within the context of action/adventure!) and it never fails to surprise.David Wenham's character has a couple of good lines but he's generally pointless but fun (a bit like the film I suppose).A great ride with a few surprises, the film can't really be called frightening, but it's definitely worth a look for action fans and lovers of the brilliant 'The Mummy'.6/7-10",7,1,2,18 May 2004
Aliens," The superior sequel (but a matter of taste too)
","James Cameron took the bear bones of the original Alien (claustraphobia, fear, corporate greed and that legendary creature) and injected the entire package with amphetamines in order to create 'Aliens'.The film takes a similar structure to the original, with the entire first act being made up almost entirely of 'build-up', apart from a few gory nightmares to please the horror fans. In the special edition the tension is heightened by revisiting the planet from the original and seeing it colonized by naive humans.When the touch paper is lit, however, 'ALiens' really comes into its own. THe action is frenetic and violent, the creatures savagery unmatched, and the situation dire, to say the least. These humans get basically butt raped by the xenomorphs and are forced into a game of survival.The grunts vs. corporation power vs. unseen enemy gives the whole film an air similar to Vietnam movies, the special creature effects are stunning and the special effects have stood up to the test of time well. Stylisitically it could all be set in the same cinematic world as CAmeron's 'The Terminator' such is the director's consistency.The Alien Queen is, to put it bluntly Sh*t Hot! This is by far and away what everyone wanted to see from a sequel; bigger, badder and better. Don't forget thought that it is a re-invention of the franchise and a totally different type of film; but if we're all being honest then Aliens takes the original by the head and punches an extendable jaw right through its face!",9,0,2,19 May 2004
Resident Evil," No, no, no, no!
","For anyone who has played throught the videogames in the series (especially the GameCube remakes) will know that it was the immense tension, slow build up, film noir-like lighting and the gritty characterisations that made the zombie action so brilliantly scary.However, it seems that Paul 'Mortal Kombat' WS Anderson spent his time watching Kerrang! on cable in the run up to over seeing the design of the film.  Resident Evil, although catering mainly for the 'teen - rockers' faternity could also have appealed to a broader horror fan, or even been a more mainstream sucess (in the same way that 'The Others' was 'Poltergeist' for thesps).The entire thing plays like a two hour rock video.  Why is the installation so clean and new?  It was housed in  a rotting mansion in the games (with its decrepid grounds and gothic architecture) and merely placing a mansion in the film does not a plot point make.The zombies had CGI eczema and the amount of cast was OTT - why not have a few specific deaths instead of popcorn cannon fodder?  The music was terrible - just because it is horror and was made in the new millenium we had to put up with thrash metal. Hmmm.Paul's sequel will be just as crap, im sure.  God, I hated this film, as I'm sure you can tell - and you will too if you're a fan of serious and genuinely frightening horror.  This is just a media franchise film I'm afraid, and very unsatisfying.I gave it a 4 just because it had a vague resemblance to the game, but the potential that the game held, cinematically, has been devoured by this actually very poor film.This style was great in 'Mortal Kombat' - it was a good, fun, meaningless film (like the game) but in the case of 'Resident Evil', a narrative that holds deep emotioal and social meaning (and is subtly scary) it is as useful as a spoon.",4,5,10,22 March 2004
The Pianist," How not to handle the Holocaust...
","I have to say that my viewing of the Pianist was hampered somewhat by a visit to the Imperial War Museum in London where I saw images of the holocaust that were so disturbing I had to hold myself back from choking.I was intrigued to see how Polanski (he raped a fourteen year old girl by the way-but thats not why I disagree slightly with the film) handled the horror, and I was confused.Yes, this was about the Jewish repressionm torture, and eventual execution but the film felt like a general refugees story with some 'Look at the evil Nazis' set pieces.  In this respect I thought it was disrespectful to what I had seen actually happen in the stock footage from the war.THe characters were only established as Jewish because the Nazis were killing them - where was evidence of culture and heritage?  This would have made the destruction of this hertiage all the more tragic, but no, we didnt see it, so they could have been anybodies - the tragedy lay in the Nazis illogical motivations to eradicate the Jewish people, did it not?Choosing Brody was a mistake too- yes, his acting is brilliant, but if that wasn' a case of the casting director saying,  'Look, he has a big nose, he's quite trendy at the moment too isn't he?, he looks Jewish (stereotype!), let's hire him', then I don't know what is.'Private Ryan' managed to personalise this entire issue in one character and was emotionally sucessful, with Schindler's list presenting the same events from this film much more emotionally.  We did not know the victims - but we weren't supposed to, the alienation made created helplessness in the audience: with 'The Pianist' we're meant to identify with the characters, but unfortunately we couldn't, because they were cardboard cut outs, and so their tradgedy becomes almost farce, and therefore innacurate and unworthy of acclaim.I think it has become fasionable to praise this film, so make up your mind after you've seen it whether you like it or not.  Please.The formal elements are excellent though, with the editing a big achievement, keeping the pace gradual and interest inducing.  The music was good, and the ending quite touching, I also enjoyed the subjective POV shots during the combat sequences - the sense of space created was sublime.Narratively though, contrived and underplayed.  THe real thing was a whole different kettle of fish.  Believe it.5 out of 10 from me people.  Spielberg has done it a whole lot better already.  Backlash nets primed.",6,1,4,16 February 2004
Hellboy," Fun, original and glossy - but flawed
","Hellboy has an absolutely brilliant premise and the opening sequence pays dividends towards it.  This part of the film - the set-up - is most definitely its strongest aspect.  Its very dark and brooding, and the direction I wish the film had taken more strongly.We are, after all, talking about a demon in a human world.Ron 'Naughty Nick Nolte' Perlman manages to play the role of the lead character with enough self-mockery and charisma to not appear like a big red gimp, but the script does not allow the character to be truely Demonic unless you count appearance; he's like atrouble teenager, not pure evil being told what to do.  If a sequel is made it would be great to see original confusions and struggles with the character (not just grafting adolescence onto the body of a red bull can).Sorry - the make up is brilliant!The best charcter is the Nazi assassin - he should most deffo been left to live for the sequel.Lovely action scenes and some cracking SFX; its got so much more to give though and could be as rewarding as 'The Crow', if it tried just a bit harder to not shovell more and more popcorn fodder at us.5-6 out of 10.  Great for a lads night with a few beers.",6,0,1,12 April 2004
Schindler's List," Haunting and visceral realism
","I had not seen Schindler's List in it's entirety for a few years.  The last time that I viewed it I was a lot younger and couldn't really digest it's complexities to the full.Of course I was able to appreciate the excellence of it's aethestics and formalities, but it was the great depth to the characters that confused me: when you are younger you view the world in as black and white a vision as this film itself, as everyone knows.I was mesmerised by the performances of Liam 'I'm Retired' Neeson and Ralph Fienes.Even Neeson's occasionally shaky accent can't hinder the fact that in his character he has realised the ambiguity and hinted capitalist, turned ever so slowly into a humanist by what should have been apparent to him all along - namely the unmotivated slaughter of his workforce.  His motivations change ever so convincingly from money to conscience and by the end of the picture the most moving moment belongs to him and not to the survivors of the terror.Fienes is such a complex character it's untrue.  Spielberg has shot the pair throughout the film as equals-and-not-quite oposites.  They are frequently intercut going through the same actions and mostly in the same space on screen) shot with an equally spaced two-shot.  This brotherhood means that Fienes is hard(er) to detest than you might think.  At times he appears to take on board Schindler's advice and passificity.  He doesn't really hate the Jewish people eiether - he's a massacist, a lover of violence and a generally nasty bloke who just needs an excuse to abuse and kill.  At one point we see him distressed at a gun misfiring again and again - it is not the gun not working, but the fact that his resolve to kill is failing after the first click of the trigger that is distressing him, i feel.  At heart he is a vulnerable coward.The various acts of violence are perfectly integrated into the flow of the picture and therefore as unexpected and unmotivated as their real-life counterparts, unlike Polanski's 'Pianist' in which they were insulting setpieces.Spielberg's film has a much greater feel of authenticity than Polanski's and is much more powerful.  It is full of touches in which you can relate to and understand, moments the summarise the best (and worst) in human nature, whereas the Pianist will feel like just one big cliche of the holocaust, after viewing 'SL'.This really is a powerful film, its just a pity that nobody seems to have learned from what it is based on.8/10",8,9,13,5 May 2004
Dumb and Dumber," The superleague of comedy.

Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Better than the original in all departments
","Home Alone was a classic kids film, but like all kids films there are jokes put in there for the benefits of the adults.Home Alone 2 is full of em!  And it's better for it.  Like the first installment the spirt of Christmas is a constantly realised concept throughout, it is nostagic and optimistic without ever being sickly.This time around Uncle Frank is even more sadistic, Harry and Marv are even more stupid, and even the legendary Tim Curry makes an appearance as the consierge worryingly obsessed with ruining the life of an eight year old boy he has never met (whilst he is smooching with Cliff!).For anybody who has visited NYC this film will be even better than it already is.Get the fire on, have some cookies and ice cream, and enjoy a magical little film. 5/10'Don't worry Harry...I'LL get him!'",5,2,6,5 May 2004
The Mission," Tragic and moving, with 'powerhouse' performances
","SPOILER:  Jeremy Irons is brilliant in this film!'The Mission' is a masterful piece of emotional manipulation coupled with historical factuality.  THe events portrayed within the film no doubt occured in real life, but I expect the reality of the situation was much less touching than portrayed in the film.The film successfully romanticises the turmoil and sacrafice that the Jesuits and the natives went through during this colonisation period.  The entire film is 'build-up' to a climax scored to perfection that draws on all of your sympathies and sorrows, creating a genuine emotional response.It made me cry anyway.  I would reccomend this one to anybody who doesn't mind being saddened by a film, but it's not all bad, because so much good has been done by Irons et al before it is all destroyed that the overall message is one of strength and hope.The acting from Irons is unbelievably good, and De Niro has a small but powerful role that was impactual enough to get his bonce on all the promotional stuff.Such a touching experience.  Don't watch it alone or you'll have no one to prove that you're not just a big girl's blowse (believe me, there shouldn't be a dry eye in the house).Also beautifully shot. 8/10.",8,1,2,7 May 2004
Tombstone," From Rambo to Tombstone - miracles can happen!
","It really is hard to believe that George P. Cosmatos was responsible for Rambo III when you've seen Tombstone.Tombstone is a film so evocative of the old West that it almost feels as though you're on  a ride at Universal rather than watching a film.The best time to watch this one is at dusk on a warm summers evening with a breeze blowing through the room, at one with the film that places you on that wooden deck outside the sheriffs office, as the sounds of the play at the towm hall near the blacksmiths drift through the air.There is a brilliant recreation of the gunfight at the OK coral (apparently based on the testament of the real Wyatt Earp) and the chemistry present within the male lead roles oozes from the screen.THere are moments of pure machismo, granted, but overall the film is one that the female audience can still enjoy, as this film does recognise that half of the west was one by women.The scene in the saloon in which Kilmer and Biehn face off is legendary.  A great, great Western in the tradition of Dances and Unforgiven.7.5/10",8,1,2,5 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A New fairytale
","This film represents, I think, for many people, a new and vibrant mythology that will live on decades into the future and be passed on through generations in the same way that literary tales like Rapunzel or Jack and The Beanstalk are.The advent of the cinema means that the medium on which the story is told is film instead of paper. It's as simple as that.There are so many great moments in Star Wars thats its hard to pick out a singular event from the story to dwell on - but now that the Revenge of The Sith has finally elaborated on the Obi-Wan/Anakin compratriotship the final light saber duel between them is given a tragic excitement that wasn't there before the prequels.Many people will disown the special editions as OTT, ruining the original vision - b*llocks to that. See the Special Editions - they are aesthetically much better and the expanded visions of creatures and systems fits in more with the new trilogy.Look out for the Storm Trooper tw*ting his head against the blast doors in the death star and also notice that the fat sh*t pilot at the end is called Porkins.A timeless classic.",8,1,2,10 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of those rare sequels....
","The Empire Strikes Back is a large improvement over the original Star Wars in terms of drama and suspense. The special effects are more consistent and more impressive (but this is because of the obviously larger budget).The most significant development is the elaboration on the Skywalker/Vader relationship, as we are beginning to understand things run far deeper than just hero versus villain. Its actually quite pshycological in the sense that it taps into the 'sons' fears of becoming their 'Fathers' worst personality elements.But enough of all that what we really want to see is large scale assaults on hidden installations, breathtaking space pursuits, Vader getting stuck in with Solo and the like and Luke screaming like a little girl at the moment of revelation no body was expecting but that now seems ingrained in the public consciousness. Does anyone actually remember being surprised to find out that Vader was Luke's father? The Emperor makes his first appearance of the original trilogy in this film, and remains enigmatic and suspicious. Vader is also extra shiny and even more relentlessly evil, having no problems in cutting his own sons wanking claw from his arm.The music is once again integral to the flow of the story, which still struggles with some particularly hammy dialogue. Still an utter classic though.Best scene: Vader sends out the bounty hunters to track down Han Solo.",9,0,1,10 May 2005
Gladiator," Emotional, evocative, emphatic - and f**cking violent!
","This film really does have it all.It's got the best British director at the wheel, it's got the pure charisma of Russell Crowe, it's got sword fighting with Romans, it's got an amzing musical score, it's got great special effects, its got the best cinematography you've seen in years, it's got evocative historical accuracy, it's got a man fighting a tiger, it's got Ollie Reed (clearly p***ed on a few occasions)............the bloody lot then.THe mastery of this film is the way in which the heart-wrenching story of Maximus is interwoven into a historical epic. THe story would have been a success even if Gladiator was lacking in the human element, but the fact is that the unholy tragedy that befalls Crowe and his subsequent quest for revenge drive the rest of the film, and make all of the various actions scenes those of 'higher stakes' than normally expected (ie. the only risk is your own skin, here it is a whole set of moral beliefs and a legacy of love).Such a perfect fusion of drama, acting, action and musical score, this film is Hollywood at it's very best, with a British twist - humilty. See it as soon as you possibly can.9/10 A future classic.",9,0,1,18 May 2004
Goodfellas," A modern popularist classic
","First and foremost, much as many so-called film conosieurs would like to think, Martin Scorsese is not an underground name anymore - and Goodfellas marked his departure from exclusive to mainstream alternative.Try to forget the urban chique that now surrounds Goodfellas and watch with a mind to experience the visceral nature of this brilliant film.  Don't think of it on terms of whats 'cool' or what 'happens'; but why and how these events are occuring.Just try to experience Goodfellas from the perpective it was intended -of Henry Hill, not of a comfortable arm chair perspective where what is, in fact sickening violence and abuse, can appear as glorified and entertaining. Imagine it was you who were at risk and apply this to Scorsese's in-your-face-approach.Joe Pesci is amazing in this film, and once again DeNiro commands each and every moment he does not share with Pesci, with total charisma and power.The benchmark to which many Scorsese and other gangster films will be measured, for years to come, and a certified part of popular culture.Stunning.",8,0,1,19 May 2004
