The Rock," The best Action-Movie since 'Die Hard'--->The ultimate Thrill-Ride!!!
","This movie has everything, what is important for a blockbuster: action nonstop, perfect actors (cage and connery are wonderful) and a lot suspense. San Francisko is a really perfect location, and thanks to Michael Bay, who has given the movie some pathos and patriotism!",10,2,2,27 February 2002
2001: A Space Odyssey," The MOTHER of all Sci-fi-movies!!!
","The best films are those you can watch several times and get something different out of each experience. One day you might be keen on exploring a film's grand ideas. Another day you might just want a good story, some interesting characters or spectacular action.2001: A Space Odyssey is such a film, although many people find its seriousness and complexity to be intimidating. After all, it does pack into 139 minutes all of human development from pre-history through to the discovery of Greater Meaning, floating through space out somewhere near Jupiter. Who wouldn't find such a film intimidating?",8,0,2,2 October 2002
