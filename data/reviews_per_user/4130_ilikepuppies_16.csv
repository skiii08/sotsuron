Walk the Line," Blur the line
","This is not an homage piece, a la 'Ray.' There are too many praise-worthy aspects of the biography left out of this for that to be the intent. This one is about performance, and its relationship to real life. About walking the line, the fine line between the two.The gist is that June and Johnny live their 'real' lives, then allow that experience to overtly reflect in their performances on stage. And sometimes the performance drives the real life, culminating in a marriage proposal (and acceptance, finally) in the middle of a performance. All aspects of their public images are deeply rooted in experience, exaggerated and replayed on stage.But between 'performance' and 'reality,' which is which and is there even a line between the two? How much does performance play a role in our marriage proposals, our troubles, our joy? Our 'real lives?'--An aside. Reese is not a good actress. She's all head and hands. All exaggeration. The style of a stage performer transplanted into films. But here she plays a stage performer, which fits nicely.",6,0,2,14 January 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Some Guy from Out of Town.
","Sure this is funny. Hilarious. But underneath that overwhelming layer lie two others that are actually more interesting and in fact highly intelligent.Cohen has mastered the skill of almost forcing his subjects into brutally honest reactions to his antics. Normally, people will only offer as much of their own prejudices as they deem will be acceptable, given whatever situation they happen to be in at the time. But what he has learned to do is to create context in which ANYTHING is indeed acceptable, thus freeing his subjects' opinions from their formerly oppressed state. That, along with putting them on the spot with extreme unpredictability enables him to draw out their opinions in a stream-of-consciousness manner.The other (and most interesting) layer is that of uniquely ambiguous narrative. Is this a Kazahkstani documentary? A 'making-of' the documentary? A feature film about the 'making of?' A video travel journal? Truth is, it's bits and pieces of all of these and more, complete with stock-footage, pseudo-stock footage, etc. I feel that this narrative mish-mash lends an air of reality which results in an extremely engaging experience. And that's the trick that makes it so side-splitting. Footage of a comedian accidentally destroying valuables in an antique shop can be enjoyed in multiple contexts: ---Fully-staged movie scene in which all players are acting their parts ---'Candid Camera' style prank in which a put-on is staged and some actors are used while others are unknowing ---Caught-on-tape incident in which an authentic accident is recorded We get the humor of these levels simultaneously, and it overwhelms.I'd like another example of a film in which almost every 'character' was played by an 'actor' who was actually oblivious to his own role. Pretty unique stuff here. It's enthralling to watch someone step outside their own movie and into someone else's, especially someone this foreign to them.The template for this was surely Henson's 'Muppet Movie,' another landmark in narrative ambiguity (and another road movie). See the two back to back.",8,1,6,15 April 2007
United 93," Pointless.
","Films exist on various levels and serve different purposes. My favorites are commonly ones which exist on a visual/cinematic stratum. This film does not abide in that category. Another impetus for creating a film might be to deliver some sort of message or political stance. These are lesser experiences, but still can carry some weight if the message is particularly profound or artfully delivered. This group is where 'United 93' should belong. Should.At this writing, it's been nearly 5 years since 9/11, an event which altered the course of human progress. That said, I think it's inexcusable that the producers of this film had absolutely nothing to say about it that wasn't immediately obvious in the days following the attacks. All we have here is a sterile real-time account of events that we all know by now. The only point seems to be that it was dramatic and horrifying for those involved. And?The truth is that this movie actually resides in the most pointless of all classes. That is, the kind that is strictly a business venture. So until you hear that all profits are being given to victims' families or the like, avoid this mess. Or pay for tickets to a different film and sneak into this, if you must see it.",2,9,27,1 May 2006
The Notebook," Directed by you and I.
","What portion of the ultimate makeup of a Hollywood product is driven directly by the viewer? An interesting topic for debate, and this film has a lot to say within the context of that debate.One can easily see what happened here. The end is so obviously incompatible with the rest of the story it jars. We suddenly have this business about love's miracles and God. The book this film was based on has no death, a detail which test audiences will subconsciously sniff out nearly every time. And I believe that's what happened here.Try to quickly think of a modern film drama with no instance of death within. It's not that easy a task. That's because as the lineage of film progresses, more and more is demanded by the viewer to qualify a movie as engaging drama. Death lends a tone of seriousness that is nearly prerequisite these days. This tacked on variation of the original ending was clearly (at least partially) created in our own imaginations, that of the viewer.So what we end up with is a film that is ostensibly about love, inwardly about memories that ends with an incongruous statement about God, via beautiful death. The love element is provided by our book's author (Sparks), the memory slant by the filmmakers and the ending thanks to you and I.A side note: The overly sugared down tone of the film has been criticized as too safe and wholesome, but it works effectively for me considering that these memories are from the minds of the elderly and presented as an elderly person might wish.",5,3,4,14 January 2006
Madagascar," Kids beware.
","I take a vested interest in what we feed our children's minds. They deserve to be challenged to think. They need abstraction. Levels of thought. Something to exercise their brains and help cultivate their own senses of creativity. That said, Dreamworks should be ashamed of marketing this dreck to children.The whole world knows by now that if one has the 80 million dollars worth of backing, he can produce any half-presentable CGI animated feature, aim it at children and produce a profit of at least 5 times the investment, apparently even if the film is laced with primarily adult content, as displayed in this film. (How many 8-year-olds had a clue what the 'American Beauty' sequence was all about?)The Dreamworks formula is a simple, 2-faceted approach. First (and foremost), adults first. More energy is spent in attempt to entertain the 30-something demographic than any other. That way, parents are more willing to accompany the kids into the theater, doubling ticket sales. After all, the ultimate choice whether anyone will see the film lies with the parents. That's why these things are packed with campy disco hits and references to old films and TV shows, none of which the kids have a clue about.Second, inject just enough vacuous slapstick and physical comedy to appease the kids. It only takes a few laughs to make a child expect the DVD upon release.Oh, and if you have time, slap in any old excuse for a moral, in this case the thin statement about not giving up on friends.That's all there is to this, folks. Another Shrek, just a lazier version. Downright insulting to a child.Look no further than this observation: There is a scene in which the film's main characters gaze at the heavens, aghast of the universe's limitless possibilities. Oddly, this very film seems oblivious to that notion.Dreamworks can't escape from their zoo.",2,21,36,15 January 2006
Superbad," Something Like 8%....
","How does one evaluate the intentionally bad? This project is along the same lines as the student who gives a speech about how NOT to give a speech, thus securing inevitable success.There is a nested story within this which mirrors the film proper. It involves a child with an overwhelming impulse to sketch one phallus after the next, an impulse the character shares with the film-makers themselves. Each scene in this movie can be seen as another gratuitously vulgar sketch drawn by an immature child. A vomiting cop. A menstrual stain. A teenager's erection. And on and on.I imagine this was the impetus for this project, to create a truly superbad film, and it could have worked somewhat, had it actually been funny. Or clever in any way. Besides, the vision has been bent by market forces, a quaint moral being obviously tacked on by the monetary powers that be. Lenders, after all do have their own formulas to attend to. It's simple risk management.I didn't get that whole funk music connection, either. Guess it's just one false detail on a fake ID.",3,15,26,12 February 2008
Knocked Up," Exposed Stitching
","The only value in this project is that it is such an obvious lesson in how advanced the study of demographics really has become.The two largest groups film-makers (at least studio-subservient film-makers) aim for are men, and women. It's a risky and delicate practice to try to appeal to both within the same film, and there are various approaches to doing so, and the most common is to find some common ground between the sexes and exploit it. For instance, Spielberg's wild success came from appealing to the child in each viewer, a common ground shared across gender lines.This is different, in what seems a modern fashion, revealing its highly-engineered skeleton. Here there is no common ground. Instead these guys have attempted to merge two genres: the romantic drama (for the ladies,) and the stoner comedy (men enjoy a good laugh at themselves, you see.) To pull this off, a delicate interweaving of elements is required to tie the two genres together seamlessly, a requisite which fails here. Th result is jarring in that the two characters (from different genres) seem wholly incompatible. It's just too unrealistic.I personally thought the chick-flick half was done more competently. Great comedy is born of pain, but when that pain is emphasized the comedy saddens. And this is sad comedy to begin with.I also disliked 'Superbad' but feel it's a notch better than this one, given the fact that it doesn't make this same mistake of taking itself seriously.",2,0,2,7 June 2008
Ratatouille," A Gourmet Peasant Dish.
","What do you do if you find yourself in the wrong skin? If you find yourself in an environment so plebeian to your own exceptional senses and skills that you'd rather leave for a new world?Evidently the answer is that you make a movie about it. And the story continues that you leave for a more sophisticated place where you will take on the best in your craft, and succeed. Further, you will find your success by pulling puppet strings, or 'animating.' And on.The parallel nature of filmmaker's story/main character's story is no accident. Pixar pulls this multi-level trick in every film they make.As for all the other aspects of this film? Craftsmanlike.(I saw an animated character animate a character of his own just twice before, in Curious George, and first in 'Duck Amuck,' which is brilliant.)",9,1,2,11 August 2007
Shrek the Third," You Can Dress Up an Ogre All You Want, But....
","Interesting, this. With this series, Dreamworks has somehow built a seemingly unstoppable franchise on a foundation of unoriginality. In fact nearly every element of these is a reference to some other film. Instead of writing a joke, these guys simply refer us to another joke we remember from some other movie. We don't laugh, we re-laugh.The mainstream movie business seems to be leaning this way. Entire films are being shot as I type this based on nothing more than fond remembrances. Thin nostalgia. It's actually shrewd business tactic at its best. The idea is to double your demographic: Target kids AND their parents. Whatever was a fad for you when you were 7 years old is sure to re-emerge when your kids are that age. It's also the opposite of what say, Pixar does, which is to actually engage the viewer on a deep level. To take our imaginations somewhere instead of just our memories.Until this. Well, sort of. This is the first offering by Dreamworks Animation Studios that I know of that at least tries. That it fails is beside the point. They should be applauded for effort.It's their first attempt at clever construction, and here's the idea: The story here is told on 3 levels simultaneously. The first (and most annoying) is our collective experience in movie-land. Second is the movie proper, the irrelevant tale of an ogre and a future king. Third is the staging of a play, which is actually based on the other two levels.If the first two levels are mild celebrations on movies themselves, the important third is a lavish ticker-tape parade, and was the missing element in the first two Shreks. Ultimately though, I'm not sure it's possible to pull this off when you're constantly dragging your audience's intelligence down with all those toilet jokes. Maybe next time they'll lower their poop-joke quota.Wonder if Dreamworks has a future king in their midst.",5,0,0,28 May 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Casting choices.
","I am always captivated by how many different approaches to acting there are, sometimes within the same film even. Here we have three completely separate approaches, and the casting agent deserves a nice portion of the credit for why this film works.--Hillary. Everything she has done to date is founded on collaboration with other actors. She works, fighting to create a give-and-take style chemistry between herself and her costars. Constant eye contact. Seemingly no peripheral vision.--Clint. His acting is of and for the camera. One can easily see his awareness of the camera at all times. Scarce eye contact. He is after all the cinema's consummate tough guy, and his catalog of genre films has demanded this of him. Be aloof and emotionally out of grasp. Mug for the camera.--Morgan. This guy works in one direction: inwards. Watch him forcing his character to think--to react to others' lines as if he has never heard them and needs time to digest the words before answering. Always thinking, introspective. That's what makes him Hollywood's reigning narrator.So we have three wildly varying approaches all cast to fit their characters snugly. Someone had some real casting insight I think.The movie is a bit of a mess as a whole (especially the overly-cliché-ed script), but in the end it is the rich stew of acting that carries the day and pulls tears from us despite other flaws.",6,0,2,23 January 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," How to Control the Act of Controlling Control.
","Reading other reviewers' comments on this film is particularly interesting. They typically sense importance without fully understanding why, and rarely are they able to successfully illustrate why they find it so enjoyable.So let me start by attempting just that myself.To me, this is about control. Mankind is under the control of some extraterrestrial beings (or Gods) while struggling for control over each other. It's the same story told twice: We are given the technology to enslave each other, once by innovation of crude weaponry (bone), the other by advanced (supercomputer).The tip-off scene is the one in which our technological leaders hold a press conference to decide what to tell the rest of the species, how best to control them. It's not Hal who's fighting for mastery over the crew. Hal is merely a surrogate for said leaders, who are responsible for programming Hal to do everything he does. No, there is no computer malfunction here. Hal is programmed to eradicate the human pawns in the event that they begin to learn the truth. So there is no 'man vs. computer' theme, but more accurately, 'man vs. man-with-computer.' A huge clue: Considering that the ape who touched the monolith is the one who gained innovation, note which character touches the one on the moon.Also consider: Dave has been enslaved to the point where his very conscience is ultimately manipulated. As soon as he defeats Hal, those with authority over him move to plan B, and the very manner in which he experiences life is wildly altered.Kubrick also chose to start another discussion about control on another level, that of the film's control over us, and that's the root of most people's confusion with this experience. And that's the deal with the ambiguous ending. With a clear ending and concrete answers, there is nothing to discuss.The stylistic choice to romanticize space as the new nature is a further experiment in manipulation, that of the film-maker over the viewer. Check out the music. It's a symphony about the beauty of earthly nature. I know he has succeeded because the film feels even more important than what I can explain.I'll leave all talk about the technical aspects of this movie to other reviewers. Typically if one is discussing this primarily in that context, he/she is missing the point completely. But even the most clueless has been controlled to feel that this film is profound. And that's profound.Everyone should see this. Multiple times.",10,2,6,19 May 2007
Toy Story," They Don't Call it 'Playing' for Nothing.
","The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word 'play' when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing.So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift.It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People.None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store.These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best.",9,1,1,19 May 2007
Die Hard," Innovative on one level, tired on many others.
","The word 'innovation' is thrown around frequently concerning this film. This word is indeed apt, but on very specific grounds. Credit must be given to how the action hero's personality is treated here. In 1988 the summer blockbuster action hero's demeanor as dead-serious stud was near-universally accepted as the only way to do it. Here we have Bruce tear down the archetype by playing it anything but serious, and letting the viewer know it. A unique delivery given the genre, and I suppose Willis deserves almost all the credit. But when considering that an actor's delivery is usually a minute percentage of a film's makeup this movie falls flat.Consider: Common-man hero minding his own business is thrown into an oppressive situation. Reacts to oppression with a fountain of wisecracks. Proves that a lone righteous vigilante is far more effective than the combined efforts of the rest of law enforcement itself (represented here by the FBI, played by ugly actors). A seemingly irreconcilable personal relationship that is solved merely by our hero's courage ('Only John could irritate someone that much'). The obligatory--- one more villain crash the victory parade only to be shot by secondary hero--- bit. Lots of guns. Lots of big fireballs. Lots of money. Lots of punching. The list of tired movie clichés goes on and on. Not much original here.And though the hero's personality is celebrated, it ultimately comes down to the tried and true notion that his ability to kick ass is his most important attribute. Like any action blockbuster, we leave the theater having learned nothing from our hero, experiencing no profound admiration for him, but merely acquiring a desire to kick as much ass. A kind of hero envy. Not unlike how 'Over the Top' left us with the desire to enter an arm-wrestling competition. It seems that that quality is indeed all that matters. (The deaths of innocent civilians and FBI agents alike are ignored during the finale's party-down celebration.) All's well that ends well for the stud. The filmmakers here even show us how to channel our newfound heroic inspiration by showing the everyday wife punch out a journalist at the end.So while this film may have re-invigorated the genre (not re-invented) it certainly did not do so in a particularly healthy way.",5,19,42,25 April 2005
Stranger Than Fiction," Bunk Rock.
","Will Ferrell's comedic stance is centered around exposing all the uncomfortable little flaws inherent in existing as a human being. All those embarrassing characteristics we all would rather not mention about ourselves are trotted out one after another. That said, a comedic noir seems a perfect fit for him, since noir usually features a helpless main character being toyed with by a higher power of some sort.So far so good.The task these film-makers set out to achieve was to take the noir form and extend the narrative in a new direction. One in which our hapless victim actually takes control half-ways through, becoming the God who is doing the capricious toying.You see, I prefer to believe that it is actually Harold who is the author of this tale, writing about an author who is writing about him (who at one point is writing about her writing about him writing about her!). With help from an actual writing instructor, he is even depicted explicitly writing the very narration that he himself hears. Indeed it is Harold in control of the film at the end, and it is he who changes the outcome.It's a clever experiment with writing itself and is in fact a movie about its own screenplay. This idea of art about itself is really becoming a part of the very fabric of our culture. It's tricky business, but as demonstrated here, film-makers are finding ways to solve the various problems associated with bringing these notions to the everyday film-goer.But. What spoils this for me was the purposeless use of music. There seems to be a growing trend in which film-makers selfishly indulge in choosing songs based simply on their own personal tastes in music, regardless of relevance to the film. (Tarantino comes to mind.) This desire to refer to one's own record collection is quite an annoyance, and basically states, 'Look how great is my taste in music!' Simply put, punk rock (and specifically British punk rock) has no place here. Consider that the song Harold sings to his love interest is one that that particular character would never know at all, much less by heart. It is an esoteric genre piece which typically attracts an opposite personality type to that of Harold, an ultra-square IRS number-head.",5,1,2,15 April 2007
Casino Royale," Poker Face.
","Two quick points to make here.First, that opening chase. It's a staple of the series to begin the film with a speedy pursuit. Forget Bond films. This is one of the most exciting of its kind in any movie I have ever seen. The best exploitation of space. And the clever abandonment of gadgetry in favor of the human body only. (Is there a more clever gadget, anyways?)Second. Poker has inherently cinematic possibilities that have never been mined in any film I have seen. The game is many things, but is primarily an acting competition. Who's the most convincing? So there's room for all sorts of experiment in acting, yet films I have seen featuring poker all seem to rely on the 'poker face' instead. It's anti-acting instead of the potentially thrilling possibility of meta-acting. Bummer.Not that Craig could have approached pulling it off, anyways.",4,11,18,27 May 2007
Rear Window," Thrown into the film.
","These types of films really transcend for me if done skillfully. That is, ones about films. Sometimes even commenting about the very makings of themselves.Here our hero is a photographer (Hitchcock) who, upon experiencing a drama, gives his own treatment to the drama itself, as accentuated by the cop buddy, who tells him directly that he is creating his own version. God creates Hitchcock, who creates Jeff, who creates his story.Along the way there are various comments being made about film-making. The camera Jeff uses to get a better look. Also, the very tools of the trade are compartmentalized, each given a 'window' to be viewed through. One window for the score, one for the choreography, etc.But the thing that sets this film apart is the way the audience is pulled into the experience. The dark, comfortable theater is actually Jeff's apartment, a notion that remains consistent throughout. That is, until the end when we are thrown out of our 'window' and into the film itself. Now that's engaging drama.Jeff is also you and I, and we also are free to create our own versions of what we see, as I have done here.",8,1,3,5 January 2006
