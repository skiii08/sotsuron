The King's Speech," Feel good factor
","Great film, one that can be washed again. I am going to take m grand parents to watch the film as they said they remember the King's Speeches.Would recommend this film to anyone. As for the cast - they all play a great role, even the dogs although I don't cant imagine they barked on queue but maybe they did who knows but the people who were there.Colin Firth is great in every film he is in, bringing a more serious and subtle humour to the theatre that distinguishes him from Hugh Grant known for his romantic comedy. Firth for me brings the edge to great Drama.10/10 - Watch it buy it, watch it again.",10,2,4,26 January 2011
