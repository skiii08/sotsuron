Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You Won't be disappointed
","Okay, it starts out a little slow, and, I'll admit It, I was a little worried at first, but in the end this is a very good sci-fi movie. It's main flaw is that the film lacks a central focus, like destroying the death star, escaping the empire etc. Instead, it's like a two-hour set up for the next two movies in the series. Aside from that, this is not the Godzilla bomb that some critics have made it out to be. Once the film gets to the pod race, about a third into the movie, it turns into a Star Wars movie that's really a lot of fun. In the final battle scene, Lucas shakes off the director's rust and delivers a tense, layered action scene worthy of Star Wars. Also, the performances are actually better than the original movies (Go back and check out some of Harrison Ford's work in the originals and cringe).The special effects are simply the best ever filmed, and open a whole new door in movie making. The best thing to do is sit back and enjoy this movie, even Jar Jar Binks begins to grow on you after awhile.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
