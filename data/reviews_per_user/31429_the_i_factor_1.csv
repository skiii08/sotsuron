50 First Dates," A light, musical , feel-good romantic comedy
","This is one of the movies which holds you on to your seats right from the start till the end.Adam Sander is a nice decent guy (forget the first five minutes).Rob Schneider as 'Ula' is hilarious.Drew Barrymore,like always is cute and sweet.The movie starts off with the comments of the girls Sander has dated for a day or so because he tries to stay away from commitments.Then he meets Barrymore at a restaurant and we see a real change in him.Barrymore suffers from short-term memory and forgets everything the next day.the girl's dad and brother do everything to make her feel normal. most of the times she lives the same day everyday! Sander tries to meet her daily with the hope that he can last in her short-term memory and he has to start off afresh everyday.this is where the movie got its name (cos all the dates were their first).the movie's ending is really unpredictable and touching and you are going to love the way it happens. Barrymore finally ends up with the guy who made her fall in love everyday. the movie has a gentle flow in it and most of the scenes have really good Hawaiian and tropical music in the background which makes it all the more romantic.The director has used locations in Hawaii and Oahu really well to add to the effect. A must watch movie with subtle comedy and a good feel.",7,0,0,24 March 2006
