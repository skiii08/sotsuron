The Blair Witch Project," You had to be there...
","Unfortunately this film falls foul to time.Hollywood has realised so much found footage (but nicely polished, found footage) over the last ten years that this film doesn't age well. Anyone younger than about 10 when this was released tends to only enjoy Hollywood horror.For anyone who saw this film after its initial release, after the way it was initially promoted will probably not enjoy it the same way.I can see why people would hate this film. But I also don't understand the raving reviews.It was a great film if you take into consideration the promotion of it and that so many 'underage kids' found a way to view it.Although I can imagine anyone above the age of 15 when they initially viewed it had already been subjected to much better horror, which I also nie have.This is a film that you really had to be there when it came out and it had to be one of your first experiences of horror.",6,2,2,2 May 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," They just get worse
",To start I'll say the only reason this film got 2 stars was Michael Keaton.This is the worst cast Spider-Man I have ever seen (but I'm sure the next will be worse as that seems to be the pattern now). It was very poor acting and awful dialogue.The Spider-Man films ate unfortunately getting worse and worse as are the Marvel films which pains me as I have been a big comic book and Marvel fan for a long long time.If you are above the age of 10 this film is not marketed towards you.The Marvel franchise although it started well has slowly slipped and taken certain actors with it. RDJ who I once considered an amazing actor is slipping further and further and no can only be described as a competent actor (or simply just Iron Man). I really hope Keating gets clear of the franchise.,1,3,6,9 January 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Perfect ending for Star Wars fans.
","All the bitterness and hatred for this film is not from Star Wars fans. Yes the original trilogy will always be the best. Yes there are many things I hated about the prequels and many things I hate about the sequels.But as a Star Wars fan, this was a perfect ending. Not a perfect film, but a perfect ending to a story I have grown up loving.I did not read one review until after seeing the film, I did not watch the trailer.This was not a complex film, yet a lot of the hate is from people that say they didn't understand what was going on. I can only guess that they were not paying attention and had already jumped on the hatred bandwagon prior to watching.Watch the film, don't listen to the reviews, including mine. But if you claim to be a star wars fan but can find no redeeming features to this film you need to rethink if you are an actual fan.",8,1,4,19 December 2019
