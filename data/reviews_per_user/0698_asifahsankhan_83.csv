Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049 molds an alternate dystopian future thirty years after the original classic
","Being a fan of the original film I was not very optimistic that the sequel would be another cult classic. I also doubted that this would leave me feeling like I'd want to see it again just to understand what had gone on in its dark, mysterious and grim backdrop, as I had after seeing the original. Even if you have not seen the first film, movie goers can watch this and still understand what is happening and keep up with the storyline. It certainly is a joy to watch and well worth the 2 hours and 45 minutes viewing time.What began with Ridley Scott long ago has been vivified with new sharpness by director Denis Villeneuve. The last film I watched directed by Denis Villeneuve was the action-thriller 'Sicario' a film I enjoyed thoroughly and was visually excellent. Here he has directed a film that is just superb in every aspect from the acting to the visual effects and storyline, and leaves us thinking for days after watching the film. There is no doubt the cinematography and visual effects here are certainly draw dropping and stunningly gorgeous - there should be no doubt that Roger Deakins will be a shoo-in for an Oscar for best cinematography. I felt myself hooked from the get go even in scenes where there is no acting or storyline - just the backdrop and stunning visuals of the futuristic city make a truly awe-inspiring film.I don't want to get into any plot details at all and spoil the movie for you, certainly we would be here a long time and would reach no actual conclusion or 100% understanding of everything! However this is what made the first Blade Runner film what it was and again the director makes this a science fiction sequel that is also placed on that higher pedestal and would take some beating if there was ever anybody with the guts to make a third Blade Runner! Who knows, maybe in 30 years there will be another sequel!",8,4,8,28 March 2018
First Man," Not sure if we ever went to the moon but in the movie we always walk on it
","Midway through First Man, astronaut Neil Armstrong is asked by a reporter at a press conference how he feels about the fact that, should the Apollo 11 mission be successful and he lands on the moon, he'll go down in history.Armstrong can't answer the question. He impatiently snaps that NASA and the ship's crew plan to be successful. Buzz Aldrin, seated by his side, eventually has to step in to talk about the crew's great responsibility and excitement, while Armstrong stares intently into the middle distance.The stoicism that might have prevented a man like Armstrong, who was facing either death or a kind of immortality, from being able to articulate an answer in that moment is the heart and soul of First Man. The film is less concerned with delivering a triumphalist portrayal of the 1969 moon landing - which has been done before, we've all seen it - and more with probing what kind of person is able to white-knuckle through the physical, emotional, and psychological toll of this sort of mission and successfully pull it off.The answer is gratifyingly, understandably intricate. Like last year's Dunkirk, First Man funnels a historical moment through an intimate experience, reminding us that events that appear triumphant in history's rear-view mirror often come at the expense of pain and great personal sacrifice shouldered by real people. But the movie, first and foremost, tells Neil Armstrong's story. We're allowed to see it through his eyes, but in return, it asks us to respect what he went through - and that is not always easy.First Man is the story of Project Gemini and the moon landing through one man's eyes. At the distance of a half-century, the facts of the moon landing are well-known to most Americans: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, the culmination of a 'space race' between the US and the USSR.All these elements are present in First Man, but the challenge with any movie based on epochal historical events is to find a fresh story in familiar facts. In this case, screenwriter Josh Singer (The Post, Spotlight) adapted James R. Hansen's authorized biography of Armstrong. (Armstrong was famously private, but he granted more than 50 hours of interviews to Hansen and gave him access to private documents and family sources.)The resulting film, directed by Damien Chazelle (who won the Best Director Oscar for La La Land in 2017) is laser-focused on Armstrong's life, beginning with the tragic cancer-related death of his 2-year-old daughter Karen in 1962, prior to him being chosen for Project Gemini. Like the book on which it's based, First Man paints a portrait of Armstrong as someone for whom heroism was never a motivator, and who viewed notoriety with deep reluctance.That the movie never really reaches a state of full-blown exhilaration is likely to frustrate viewers who are looking to have their sense of ownership in its historical events reinforced. But rather than focus on American achievement, First Man pays its deepest respects to Armstrong and to the men and women who risked and sacrificed their lives to get to the moon. The movie sees Armstrong's reserve as both a blessing and a curse, a gift and a problem, but it's unequivocal in its admiration of his humility. And in this way, it feels less like it's forcing a myth onto the man who made it clear to his biographer that he wasn't seeking renown - and more like a statement of gratitude.",8,6,14,28 November 2018
Requiem for a Dream," This has got to be saddest film I've ever seen!
","Various unique stylistic elements that make up Requiem for a Dream, the plot is a tragic but quietly beautiful story about addiction and obsession. Adapted from Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel of the same name it is, without any doubt, one of the most depressing screenplays ever written. But the post-viewing feeling of emptiness is part of Requiem for a Dream's excellence. It's difficult not to love the film in spite of the story's cruelty, and admire the craftsmanship that made it.Here are the three key elements: The Movie: Darren Aronofsky's most noted film about 4 people indulged in drug addictions. They descend further and further down the spiral until their untimely ends. With lines like, 'In the end it's all nice'—turns out to be deliberately made or meant to deceive, all of us.The Weird Part: Aronofsky's disturbing look at addiction is topped off with Ellen Burstyn in arguably her greatest role as a woman overdosing on diet pills to get a role on her favourite TV show.The Weirdest Moment: Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and another prostitute are forced to have sexual intercourse using a double ended dildo.",9,0,0,27 June 2017
War Dogs," So yet another Martin Scorsese wannabe? So what? At least it was a good one!
","Based on a Rolling Stone article, and subsequent book, by Guy Lawson, 'War Dogs' tells the improbably true story of how a couple twenty-something meat-heads from Miami gamed the no-bid contract system then-Vice President Dick Cheney put into place to award government contracts. As if you needed any proof that was a terrible plan from the beginning, here come two idiots to prove just how easy it was. Miles Teller stars as David Packouz, a seemingly nice stoner stuck in a dead-end, degrading job, with a baby on the way and no way to support her. Enter his childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill), an obvious sociopath and con man with a plan to get rich selling guns through the new no-bid system.There are a lot of problems with War Dogs, but the performances aren't among them..... Teller is always watchable, and even though David is a bit of a wet noodle, and makes for the most gullible narrator in the history of ever, Teller's charm keeps him interesting enough. But Hill is the real standout, going in literal guns blazing as Efraim. Hill does not shy away from Efraim's excess or his pathetic over-doings, and he embraces Efraim's slimy amorality and turns him into what should be one of the great cinematic scumbags, alongside Tony Montana and Jimmy Conway. And that's the problem. As the film moves towards, sneakingly, wanting to pave its intention to copy 'Goodfellas,' and eventually does, makes it a waste to a somewhat enjoyable ending. So another Martin Scorsese wannabe? So what? (To be fair, eventually everybody rips Marty's Wiseguys or one of DeNiro's classic off at some point in their career).At least this was a good one!The conflict that comes of mouthy, aggressive and woefully under qualified wise-boys-wannabes entering into a world which is clearly more complex than they can instantly comprehend has become a modern dramatic boilerplate – As the American dreamers hammering bureaucratic weak spots for tidy personal gain. Yet where War Dogs offers a cautious celebration of reckless, industrious youth, the film itself is the product of a filmmaker who is utterly unwilling to scavenge for advantageous points of entry. But all that potential is wasted by Phillips' conflicting messages. He wants this to be condemnatory of the 'kill or be killed' economic mentality that ruined our economy, but he also wants us to care whether or not David and Efraim are still friends. (It's never clear, at any moment, why we should like Efraim at all, let alone hope he has friends.) He wants to excoriate Bush-era policies, but also revel in bros being bros in the Iraqi desert. And, like The Wolf of Wall Street, the economic commentary is compromised by the glut of wealth porn as the boys revel in their fast-made millions.Perhaps fans might have hoped for more comedic moments in 'War Dogs.' Because of Jonah Hill's comedic history (as well as that of Miles Teller), it could easily have been utilised more, which would have strengthened the character development between Efraim and David.Aside from its more obvious predecessors, War Dogs also takes a superficial, but interesting look at the cultural legacy of Brian De Palma's Scarface. Hill's Efraim Diveroli mounts a giant screen-cap canvas of Al Pacino wielding his 'little friend' on the wall of his office like a moral totem. He references the film, claiming that the pair are akin to high-rolling gangsters, getting things done like money-making machines, leaving the ethics of their endeavour for someone else to deal with. Phillips constantly finds ways to let his heroes of the hook, always taking their semantic swerving at face value. He is loath to just let their criminal conniving be judged as such. There's always the sense that this film will only work if an audience believes that the scampi-sh wars dogs themselves are full- bore idiots, and not pathetic bottom-feeders in hand-me-down cabana wear. And in the tradition of Scarface, Goodfellas, and The Wolf of Wall Street—so basically, all the classic American Scumbag movies — with a dash of The Big Short thrown in for a falsely moralising ending, War Dogs is a sweaty, bro-y, barely even sheepish celebration of Bush- era amorality dressed in coke and cash that squanders a brilliant scumbag performance from Jonah Hill, Miles Teller and a very watchable Bradley Cooper. What more could you ask for? Watch it, it's pretty good if you're in the mood and maybe even better if you're new to the genre.",7,0,0,30 December 2016
In Bruges," 'A great day this has turned out to be. I'm suicidal, me mate tries to kill me, me gun gets nicked and we're still in f-ing Bruges!!!!'
","'A great day this has turned out to be. I'm suicidal, me mate tries to kill me, me gun gets nicked and we're still in f-ing Bruges!!!!'Colin Farrell plays Ray, a young Irish hit man who botched his first job and ended up shooting an innocent young boy. He and his partner, the older, more seasoned Ken (Brendan Gleeson), are packed out of London by their overbearing crime boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes, almost unrecognizable with cockney accent and perpetual sneer) to the quiet Belgian tourist town of Bruges. They are to stay in Bruges until they receive further orders from Harry. They are urged to enjoy their time in the city, which Harry remembers from his childhood as being 'like a f-ing fairy tale or something.'This hilarious, moody, very violent film by writer-director Martin McDonagh is incredibly difficult to characterize. Is it a comedy? An action/heist flick? A downer drama? Hard to say. Whatever it is, it blends elements of all these genres brilliantly, features excellent comic performances by the three leads, and even while you're cracking up, you may find yourself pondering larger questions of death, morality, and purpose-why we are where we are, both physically and spiritually.This is a unique, and uniquely enjoyable film that, with humor, examines the conscience and the part it plays in our lives, our deaths, and, perhaps most poignantly, whatever comes in between. A word of warning: you must have a fairly high toleration for disturbing violence and extremely thick Irish accents.",9,0,0,2 April 2018
Rocketman," In an exceptionally demanding role with sky-high expectations, Egerton was spectacular.
","To be upfront, I am notedly critical of the biopic genre, particularly those that center around musicians and performers, primarily because a life's story does not provide a narrative structure with an actual plot. When the totality of a career is the crowning achievement of a life that is being depicted, the guidelines are often too vague to create an actual cohesive tale about said life. Biopics are the film counterparts to nonfiction biographies you can find at your local publicly funded library, and if you have not read one of those since doing a book report in Elementary School, you can be forgiven. While the material could be fascinating, the medium consists of a recitation of facts and events, as opposed to an actual story. In my opinion, biographies translate better into a documentary-style film, rather than a forced narrative out of a compilation of factually embellished, loosely connected significant moments.Having said that, it is to a film's credit when it tries to be creative with the material it is given, even as it is simultaneously handicapped by its ill-defined goals. 'Rocketman' attempts to remedy this obstacle by using Elton's group therapy in rehab as a framing device, where he recounts his life up until that point. It is not the most original technique ever utilized, but it does signify an effort to create an organized story. But ultimately, people do not go to see films like 'Rocketman' to identify if there is a narrative structure or not. Chances are that I am amongst the few who suck the fun out of an experience by demanding certain checkmarks that are irrelevant to most. The masses flock to the theaters to see Elton perform his many hit songs and possibly learn a little something along the way, and by that measure, 'Rocketman' succeeds beyond a shadow of a doubt. This is a film with exceptional performances and musical displays.If you are a fan of Elton John, and I believe that is a safe assumption if you are a viewer of the film, you shan't be disappointed with the renditions of most of his greatest hits in the film. The cast is brilliant with their singing, treating the songs like the true art they are, often incorporating elements of fantasy into the choreography that accompanies the lyrics. And to the film's merit, the songs are actively used as plot devices to facilitate character development, a technique that can often be difficult to effectively execute. The entirety of the productions of 'Saturday Night's Alright (for Fighting)', 'Your Song', and 'Yellow Brick Road' are personal favorites of mine, as they display the heights of heart and passion within Elton.Lead actor Taron Egerton deserves an immense amount of praise for his performance in this role. He fully encapsulates every aspect of Elton, including his display of exceptional vocal talents and energetic, rhythmic dance moves. On the more personal angles of Elton's life, Egerton totally espouses the pain and rage of the loneliness he endured, whether it be due to him coming to grips with his sexuality or the void left by the cold-heartedness of his mother and abandonment by his father, as well as the hedonistic lifestyle Elton embraced as a coping mechanism throughout much of his life. This role was exceptionally demanding and accompanied with sky-high expectations, and Egerton was spectacular.",8,3,5,16 July 2019
A Star Is Born," Apart from a rush ending, this is probably the best remake of the classic flick
","This is the third remake of a classic flick, the Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga film is an impressive spectacle that hits most of the emotional highs and lows audiences want from a movie that promises to take you on a melodramatic journey.Not melodramatic in a bad way, melodramatic in that everything is heightened - the triumphs are soaring, the tragedies are crushing. Musicals are not subtle beasts.Is it perfect, the most amazing movie you'll see this year? No, but it is pretty great.It's an electric experience, with Cooper borrowing filming and editing techniques from concert films, filling the frame with an undeniable energy. When Ally hits those first notes, you are completely with her. Her joy is your joy - that emotional transference from screen to spectator is seamless.Their chemistry is palpable - Cooper and Gaga are clearly on the same wavelength and they're able to have you invest in Ally and Jack's relationship immediately.Anyone who has seen any of the three previous versions, starring Janet Gaynor (1937), Judy Garland (1954) and Barbra Streisand (1976), will no doubt remember how it ends. But even for those who haven't, it's a familiar trajectory.The idea is that there are only so many stars - one must move aside for another. So the story isn't just about Ally's journey to the top of the charts and acclaim, it's also about Jack's descent and increasing irrelevance.Telling the downfall story requires more finesse than A Star Is Born is able to manage - the Garland version does this very well and it's inevitable that this version will always be compared to the ones before it.Cooper's performance as the sad and struggling Jack is brilliantly calibrated, and consistent throughout - he even nailed the physicality of it, from that leathered, fake-tanned face to the lower octave voice and the constant, sweaty sheen of an alcoholic.As a director, Cooper is exacting and meticulous with every detail - it's a real achievement for a first-timer.Sam Elliot as Jack's older half-brother and manager brings another level of humanity to the film while Dave Chappelle is always welcome in a dramatic role.The Garland version was able to tap into the dehumanizing side of the Hollywood studio system and the trappings of fame, but Cooper's A Star Is Born is more ambivalent about the music business.A Star Is Born is a satisfying and emotionally evocative epic, nevertheless. And perhaps the 'best film' this year.",8,0,2,13 December 2018
The Death of Stalin," Political savagery at its best!
","Armando Iannucci has written and directed two films in his career, and they're both among the best political comedies ever made. First there was 'In the Loop,' an extension of his British TV series 'The Thick of It' (he also created HBO's 'Veep') that used fictional U.K. and U.S. functionaries to satirize our two nations' political dysfunction and eagerness for war. Now he returns (with co-writers David Schneider and Ian Martin) with 'The Death of Stalin,' a breathtakingly dark comedy of errors that holds up the brutal Soviet dictator's final days and their aftermath as a mirror to current British and American quagmires.The fictionalized plot, which hardly exaggerates the truth, comes from a French graphic novel; Iannucci and company have added comedy to it, replaying horrific events as farce, turning everyone into greedy bumblers vying to be Stalin's successor, finding grim laughs in the minutiae of his reign of terror. ('Don't worry!' says the Radio Moscow director cheerily to the audience he's hastily assembling at Stalin's command. 'Nobody's going to get killed!') When a not-yet-dead Stalin is lying unconscious on his office floor, everyone who enters the room inadvertently kneels in the same puddle of urine next to his body.The masterstroke, however, is in the casting, and in the decision to have everyone speak in their native accents. So here's Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev, a loud buffoon and sycophant who keeps track of which of his jokes get the best laughs; Jeffrey Tambor as Georgy Malenkov, Stalin's gullible deputy (he weeps hilariously at the sight of Dear Leader incapacitated) whose idiocy makes him useful; Simon Russell Beale as Lavrenti Beria, a Cheney-like opportunist; Michael Palin as Vyacheslav Molotov, a befuddled bureaucrat who was on Stalin's to-kill list; Jason Isaacs as Georgy Zhukov, swaggering military commander; Rupert Friend as Stalin's raving conspiracy-theorist son. Stalin himself is played by Adrian McLoughlin in a rough working-class British accent, coming across like a street thug who rose to the top of a crime syndicate.The few women who are present in all this - Stalin's daughter (Andrea Riseborough), an anti-Stalin concert pianist (Olga Kurylenko), Khrushchev's wife (Sylvestra Le Touzel), even down to Stalin's secretary (June Watson) - happen to be the only reasonable, mature people in the story. This may have been a conscious choice by the filmmakers to comment on male paranoia and competition, or it may just be historically accurate.True to form, Iannucci packs the dialogue with petty sniping and profane insults, cheerfully mining laughs from ghastly true events. It's the sort of movie where you kill a political enemy, set him on fire, and then yell obscenities at the burning corpse. (Incidentally, it's been ages since we saw Monty Python's Michael Palin on the big screen, and Iannucci's snarky-intellectual banter is a perfect fit for him.) But where Iannucci's past work has had a fly-on-the-wall documentary feel, 'The Death of Stalin' is more elegantly cinematic, accompanied by classical music (Chopin, Mozart, and of course Tchaikovsky) on the soundtrack. He performs a delicate tight-rope act, conjuring thoughts of Brexit and Trump without laying it on too thick, and mocking political connivers of all stripes with eloquent savagery.",8,0,0,29 July 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Seriously, this was a good movie. Go see it – twice!
","'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story' is every bit as good as you've heard; even this non-'Star Wars' geek had great fun with it. I'd cheerfully give it a 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend you give it a try even if you don't typically enjoy the franchise.Die-hard fans are currently noting all of the things that make this film unique in the series: it's the first 'Star Wars' movie without a Jedi, the first without the trademark opening text-crawl, the first one without a lightsaber duel.Casual fans might be more impressed with more general differences. Two stood out for me.One, this is the first Star Wars film since 'The Empire Strikes Back' (1980) that seems aimed mainly at adults. Yes, the fairy tale elements are still there — we have an underdog orphan searching for her father, the requisite anthropomorphic aliens, and a humorous robot mascot (which surprisingly worked quite well). But those elements are absolutely upstaged by a bona fide war film, complete with tactics, strategy, panic, collateral damage and casualties. I remember thinking during a surprisingly gritty urban warfare scene that it was as though some filmmakers had taken a scene from a film like 'The Hurt Locker' (2008) and set it within the 'Star Wars' universe.Two, I think that this is the most human Star Wars movie we've had since 'Empire.' It wouldn't be 'Star Wars' without the aforementioned aliens and robots, and plenty of references are made to the Force and the Jedi. But this is a movie about ordinary people. Yes, there is one larger-than-life character who appears  force-sensitive? This universe's equivalent of Marvel's 'Daredevil?' (This was a confusing story element that didn't always work for me.) But we are presented primarily with all-too-human anti-heroes who feel fear, suffer, and die.Isn't that more exciting than watching cartoonish aliens fight armies of equally cute battle-droids? In this film's better moments, it made me feel like a was watching a 'real' war with 'real' people, and I was surprised to find myself actually rooting for the good guys in a 'Star Wars' film — this has been a series that I've long half-dismissed as being essentially children's stories.Seriously, this was a good movie. Go see it – twice!",8,4,8,22 January 2017
The Fan," This could've been a great film. And 'I'm as serious as a F**king heart attack!'
","Any other actor might have kept us guessing about where the plot was heading... but we were straight out lucky to have the greatest actor on the planet (that's Robert De Niro) playing the role of Gil Renard, a baseball freak fixated on centre fielder Bobby Rayburn (Wesley Snipes), who has traded up from Milwaukee to the San Francisco Giants with a wow $40 million contract. For De Niro, maybe, it was just another film role, just another character and yet another, brilliant performance, which would go unnoticed... The term 'method acting' is synonymous with Robert De Niro. With De Niro, there's no mystery. He flashes that sicko grin from his seat in Candlestick Park, and we duck. He learns he's about to lose his job selling knives (!), and we know it won't be long until the stabbing starts. That's the problem. You sit down to watch The Fan and wonder how De Niro is going to come up with something new after firing on presidential candidate Leonard Harris in Taxi Driver, kidnapping TV star Jerry Lewis in The King of Comedy, torturing lawyer Nick Nolte in Cape Fear and abusing stepson Leonardo DiCaprio in This Boy's Life, to name just a few of the victims De Niro has memorably stalked.Up till this point, 'The Fan' is badly rated because of Tony Scott's miss-direction, not crappy performances by the cast or anything like a bad plot line. It shows signs of finding fresh life in a stale formula even Jim Carrey couldn't sell with The Cable Guy. De Niro is so persuasive and moving that you wish the film would let him develop the character and dodge the slasher stuff. It's not to be. The Fan rides with De Niro, (and no one else, okay maybe the kids were fine as well) substituting crass exploitation for insight.Perhaps the late great director's brother, Ridley Scott could find gravity in this story; Tony Scott goes for the gore and the box- office gold. He strands his MVP, who is too skilled an actor to let himself get typed. De Niro will never be a typecast. A nut. One more flick like The Fan and he may discover he's created his own Frankenstein monster. De Niro is someone we knew from the moment we saw him for the first time on screen: How god damn good he really was...and still is... and can be. The film roles doesn't matter, seriously. What Bill Clinton Is To fries and a Big Mac, Robert De Niro is to psychos and mobsters. He can't get enough of them. De Niro eats those suckers for breakfast. Maybe he should change his diet after The Fan, (which he did actually). Because sometime you just need to skip your breakfast, you know, just to get your appetite ready for a bigger meal, for lunch. A pumped-up, pin-headed thriller from slick-trick director, the late Tony Scott, this could've been a great film. And 'I'm as serious as a F**king heart attack!'",7,1,1,5 January 2017
127 Hours," It is exactly 'an action movie with a guy who can't move.'
","Danny Boyle's biographical survival drama is based on the real life story of Aron Ralston's ill-fated trip to the chasm of an isolated slot canyon in Blue John Canyon, south eastern Utah and more specifically from his memoir 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place'. Set in April, 2003 – It follows adventurer Ralston (James Franco) as he hikes through a slot canyon.While climbing down it, he accidentally slips and falls. A boulder pins his arm against the canyon wall and he is stuck. His several attempts at removing the boulder and calling for help are to no avail. He begins recording a video diary on his camera (so as to keep a running dialogue with the audience) and rations his food and water. He then starts using his pocketknife to carve away parts of the boulder so as to unlock his arm.'127 Hours' is purely a James Franco show — there are other people in the cast, like a couple of hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) he briefly meets, and flashbacks to his sister (Lizzy Caplan) and his girlfriend (Clémence Poésy), all glimpsed in memories, but for the majority of the run-time of Danny Boyle's film Franco is alone on screen, doing a remarkable job of holding our attention with no one to talk to but his camera and his own increasingly desperate self.Wondering how on earth he got to that stage drives the narrative and provides all the tension we need. By also inter-cutting Franco's performance with flashbacks, what could have been a necessarily static film became quite dynamic! It is exactly 'an action movie with a guy who can't move'.",9,1,3,18 July 2017
Spotlight," More thrilling than most thriller movies!
","It's a story of unglamorous leg-work rather than thundering revelation. The drama here comes from the detail, and the reporters' slow realisation that their investigation could change the world far beyond Boston's city limits. The Church's power is revealed as smoke, mirrors and an unwarranted sense of deference, with journalism at its best proving its worth.Director Thomas McCarthy's great strength is in his refusal to pander to audiences, or to default to easy answers; the correct reaction to the team's work is horror rather than jubilation. And while admirable, the reporters take some blame upon themselves. This crisis, after all, developed under their noses and it took an outsider to force them to examine it. Similarly, the cast (Mark Ruffalo was freakin' good!) modestly play down their characters' achievements and reputations. There is no Oscar-bait grandstanding (well, maybe one moment) and they all look quietly dowdy without indulging in any unnecessary uglification. These journalist greats could happily have rubbed shoulders with Woodward and Bernstein in All The President's Men, and they bring down an even bigger institution.Talky and intelligent, this lacks the glib edge of Aaron Sorkin or the poppy zip of Tarantino. Given the subject matter, too much lightness would be inappropriate. Instead, its tone is led by its characters, moving from scepticism to revelation and the uncomfortable sense that we should all feel guilty for ignoring the secrets too hard to acknowledge.",8,1,1,28 February 2018
Insomnia," 'You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a f*%king plumber!' - Will Dormer (Al Pacino)
","Insomnia is directed by Christopher Nolan and was released in the year 2002. Walter Finch is the antagonist of the movie and is portrayed by Robin Williams. He is a really calm and cool villain who is always one step ahead of the hero, Will Domer (Al Pacino). Don't trust him by his innocent looks as he is capable of doing much harm that you can't even imagine. Even though Insomnia remains as one of the most underrated works of Nolan till date, Walter Finch is definitely one of the finest villains ever in the movies.Instead of darkness and shadow, the movie takes place in unforgiving, continuous brightness, the 24-hour daylight of a small town in Alaska in the summer months, where a teenage girl has been discovered beaten to death, her body showing signs of ritual killing. A grizzled LA detective is brought in to show the local cops how to take down a villain this scary – a detective who has accepted this godforsaken assignment because he is in trouble with the Internal Affairs department back in the big city. His investigation goes horrifically wrong and his bad conscience, his festering awareness of career mortality and his screwed-up circadian rhythms mean that he is driven slowly mad with sleep deprivation: a kind of fatal familial insomnia of the soul.Only those people who don't suffer from insomnia have the luxury of thinking it's a disturbing metaphor – when the simple physical condition itself is what is truly disturbing. So Al Pacino is inspired casting as the haggard detective Will Dormer, the policeman with the world's most ironic name. Nolan contrives a weirdly Inception dream- like chase between the two men across logs on a freezing river, and also sets up some terrific, Michael Mann-style head-to-head clashes as Dormer tells the creepy writer exactly what he thinks of him. 'You have no motivation,' snarls Pacino, You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a f*%king plumber!'",9,1,1,24 July 2017
Aquaman," Perhaps the Coolest DC superhero movie ever made!
","One of the most compelling aspects of Aquaman is the underwater superhero himself. While his initial casting was rather controversial, Jason Momoa absolutely nailed the role of Arthur Curry. Right off the bat, Momoa sold his performance to audiences as both a badass and charismatic character that everyone could root for. He had the perfect balance of snark that made Iron Man such an entertaining character and fervor that has made Batman such a big-screen spectacle. Even with these qualities, the future King of Atlantis was still a flawed protagonist. He wasn't a perfect character, which really only made him more compelling as the story went on.While the actual plot of the movie may have seemed incredibly familiar, being another one of the brothers fighting for the throne stories like Thor, Black Panther and The Lion King, it still did a decent job at making it stand out from the competition. While there were certainly familiar aspects that were similar to those other movies, like the duelling scenes in Black Panther, Aquaman still kept some originality in the matter in order to keep things unpredictable. Additionally, the movie did a great job of avoiding cop-out deaths in order to trigger emotional reactions from the audience, with all of the emotion in the movie developing from the story itself rather than from these cheap tricks that many superhero movies have ridden on recently.The absolute best feature of Aquaman, however, had to be its visuals. Whether the scenes took place underwater in Atlantis or in a city in Italy, nearly every shot of James Wan's was absolutely breathtaking. While previous DC movies like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice had clever framing, the shots didn't really stand out like the shots in Aquaman. The main difference that made this DC adventure stand far above Batman v. Superman was the color pallete. Previous DC movies attempted to have darker visuals with a desaturated look, whereas Wan and his team pushed the limits of color throughout the movie's entire duration. Its color and visual effects were even better than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which broke records with the amount of visual effects put into it.All things considered, Aquaman is a huge win for DC and Warner Bros. Pictures. Its narrative is compelling, the protagonist is well developed, and it's just a whole lot of fun to watch from beginning to end. This is definitely a movie that you will not want to miss in theaters, as the big screen is truly the best way to experience the visually stunning look that this brings to the table. At the end of the day, Aquaman may just be the best DC movie we have seen in years, possibly even better than last year's Wonder Woman. Hopefully this fantastic storytelling becomes a pattern for DC movies going forward.",8,1,4,21 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Humorous drama that tickles both your brain and body
","Ever since DP became a sensation and a worldwide phenomenon, die-hard fans have been asking for a worthey second entry. For a long time, superhero movies - not to be confused with films based on graphic novels, which is an interesting item of truth - have become a pinata for serious film critics and reasons are not lacking because we are talking about a cataract of conservative products, mediocre and totally interchangeable with each other. Typical examples of what happens when marketing and advertising discourse replace creativity and some kind of narrative, rhetorical and / or even formal talent (the stories of these 'cosos' are otherwise schematic , do not say anything at all and are even hyper redundant in terms of digital gadgets, today present in all sad pompous proposal of the mainstream). But perhaps the worst of all is that they bore with their childish and semi-televised dialectic - from the TV of yesteryear - oriented to reproduce ad infinitum the same antics.With this panorama it is not surprising that even the exponents who try to break a couple of rules of the format end up falling into the usual quagmire of non-development of characters, the most ancient political correctness, the humor for young children, that pathetic self-referentiality and constant a concatenation of prefixed niches of the market - it is not even possible to call them subframes - that can only appeal to a series of individuals co-opted by the most aseptic industry, the one that for a couple of decades has decided to ignore any nonconformist substrate at the level of the ideological basis of their 'toys'. Deadpool 2 is another link in this endless chain of perky fun-time itself (hobby products that do not even pass the time), which once again highlights the crisis of a cultural conglomerate that fetishes the most burned clichés.Pretending to be 'set sail' for the puerile level of superhero movies, this sequel to the work of 2016 essentially repeats the formula of its predecessor: many jokes with harmless puteadas, some very innocuous sexual allusion, scenes of action that are ironic, Tired questioning to camera and a cheap background melodrama that sabotages itself because the movie-read the Marvel factory-does not understand that because of so much 'attitude surpassed of everything', both beretta cancherism and so many plastic simulated CGIs, nobody can identify with these shiny but well-emptied jars from a rusty and insipid assembly line. In other words, DP2 is the perfect sequel to DP, specifically. Doubles down on everything that fans love about the original, nonstop graphic violence, gore, torture, sex, nudity, swearing, drinking, drug use, and more, so expect the same here, while it fixes some of the first film's issues. Also this one features the best post credits scene EVER. Yes! Deadpool 2 as the title says, gives the audience two end-credit scenes. Ladies and gentlemen, the wait for the scenes are worth it! Hilarious is the perfect word to describe how the audience feels of watching 'em. They don't relate much with the whole story but the crack jokes are powerful enough to make people care of the clips. The sequel is superior to its ancestor. It conveys silly comic drama that stimulates both your cerebrum and body.",8,134,318,14 May 2018
Midnight in Paris," 'These people don't have any antibiotics!'
","Gil (Owen Wilson) is a reluctant Hollywood screenwriter and a hopeless romantic who yearns for the Paris of The Twenties, who wants to live in a small loft and eat baguettes and write a great novel. He's tagged-along to Paris with his fiancée Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her conservative, wealthy parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) on the father's business trip in order to embrace the city. Inez wants to shop and spend time with her former professor Paul (Michael Sheen), a bombastic know-it-all who constantly spews factoids to the point he argues with a tour guide (Carla Bruni). Gil can't stand the pseudo-intellectualism and extravagance, and so one night, drunk from a wine-tasting, he wanders the streets to walk alone. While sitting on a lone staircase amid the chiming of the church-bells at midnight, an old-timely Peugeot from the 20's rolls up and a gaggle of drunk Parisians entice him to come with them to a party.Of course, Gil can only visit this world at midnight, and so he finds himself working diligently during the daylight hours on his novel to present it to his new Roaring Twenties compatriots when he gets magically whisked away at midnight by old-timely conveyance. Gil also must compete with his burgeoning affection for a mysterious muse he meets at Gertrude's home, the lovely Adriana (Marion Cotillard). The weird comedy of errors situation is weak but essential -- Midnight in Paris frames itself on romantic notions, and what would a romance be without romance, NE c/est pas? So what comes about is a moral tug-of-war, wanting to live and love this seemingly perfect enchantress -- one who gained the love of both Picasso and Hemingway -- or dealing with his catty and poorly named fiancée, Inez? To Gil's credit, he's not an unfeeling cad, so it's at least a battle, but at times it feels like using the Gallic shrug to dispel the infidelity. Tis Paris, Mon-Amie! Affairs come gratis with the befoul burgeoning.While Rachel McAdams is a wonderful replacement for Scarlett Johanssen, and Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy are brilliant as the grousing tea-baggier haves, it's really in the Twenties where the film is extravagantly magical. Before I gush madly about the clownishly wondrous stereotypical twenties characters, I must spend at least a moment expressing my love for Michael Sheen. His elitist Paul is something to behold the trailers can't even capture how wonderfully arrogant and aggravating he truly is in the part. And his American accent's pretty f*King boss too. I'm not as well versed on the non-American actors as I should be, so I'm probably leaving out properly being stunned as I should be, but virtually everyone who represents one of the famed figures plucked from history are cast and characterised perfectly. Alison Pill's drunken sauciness, Tom Hiddleston's properly coif-ed devotion, Marcial Di Fonzo Bo's explosive passion as Picasso -- they're all maddeningly perfect. They drive the narrative, but still manage to generate these hilarious moments with Gil. Kathy Bates is terrific as Gertrude Stein, Adrian Brody is the best I've ever seen him in an actor that I think is stunningly talented as the fiery Dali, and Corey Stoll is phenomenally brooding and yet exuberant as Hemingway.Owen Wilson must have been saving all of that energy from all his other slackest roles to bring it here. Since every Woody Allen lead essentially plays Woody Allen, Wilson does an admirable job. He reigns in the snobbish, instead infusing Gil with a childlike energy. Even when he complains, it's less grousing and more like a small kid bemoaning a 7:30 bedtime. It's the infectious and charming Owen Wilson, and so you're willing to ride with Gil through his magical time- travel adventures. The only failure in the film are the love interests. They have nothing to do, no fire of their own, save some mediocre attempts at plot driving. It's hard to root for Gil to choose anyone: even his ultimate choice. Woody Allen's love stories have always been cynical and pragmatic, but when you're writing a capital-R romance, you can't get away with that s*it.Paris becomes the ultimate star of Midnight in Paris, with a strangely appealing almost short film montage opening the film, and then several scenes that are so achingly poetic it's like watching the Pageant of the Masters. Since Woody Allen does his famous medium shot dialogue tracking shots, when set amid the succulent beauty of a Parisian landmark, it just enhances everything that much more. Since leaving London, Allen's scored himself an Oscar nomination -- and I wouldn't be shocked to see a few more from this darling little sleeper. Perhaps his eastward drift is going to be a boon. Logically, he'll either go Scandinavian or perhaps Italian. Eventually he'll settle into Asia, which seems to be where he's most comfortable these days. So while you're drinking in the explosive swords and cymbalists of this summer, give yourself a chance to appreciate this quiet little gem. It's a nice return to form for both Allen and Owen Wilson, and you'll probably be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",9,0,0,19 June 2017
The Prestige," 'Are you watching closely?'
","This is a Christopher Nolan film, that's the first thing to notice here. But it's no Dark Knight or an Inception. It's a Magic movie. And... The film will play a bunch off tricks with your mind and way faster than you can say: 'Abracadebra!!'Rival magicians Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale) have a long history of bad blood, beginning when Angier blamed Borden for the accidental death of his wife during a show. They part ways and Borden, with his illusion designer Fallon, creates a magic trick called 'The Transported Man,' in which he enters one cabinet and exits another immediately after. With the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Angier creates his own version of the trick with a mysterious machine.The story culminates with Borden finding a tank where Angier is drowning and being accused of Angier's murder. There are actually has two twists, one that is mundane and the other which is extraordinary, both based on the reveal of how the two men performed their separate tricks.On stage left, you have Christian Bale's ambitious magician, who reveals that he has pulled off all of his tricks over the years by actually being a pair of twins who have spent their lives acting as a single person. On stage right you have Hugh Jackman's self- destructive showman, who actually helps create a science fiction cloning device that allows him to pull off his illusions. It's two insane plot twists for the price of one, and you didn't see either coming.Angier's machine was actually a cloning device, and his clones were killed after each performance, drowned in a water tank. Borden's twist is simpler but more surprising: Like — he was actually identical twins, the two men each living half as Borden and half as the mysterious Fallon.A must see for everyone not just Nolan fans.",9,2,3,24 July 2017
Ready Player One," Ready Player One definitely entertains.
","Steven Spielberg, master of 1980s pop culture, helms Ernest Cline's rollicking sci-fi adventure tale, in which young heroes take on big corporation IOI inside the virtual universe of The Oasis, seeking three keys. These lead to the ultimate prize, an Easter egg granting ownership of late trillionaire James Halliday's (Mark Rylance) magic kingdom in which everything's a reference. The plot is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Halliday is Willy Wonka, and then there's the huge array of nods to 1980s pop culture. It's so meta it's basically South Park's taco, within a taco, inside a taco.But deep inside, this taco is empty. With ample opportunity to contrast the virtual utopia with the real world of the impoverished Stacks (towering trailer parks amidst dystopian Wall-E landscapes), Spielberg cuts between realities, with little of the flair of his far superior sci-fi Minority Report. In a virtual realm where your avatar can be literally any thing you like, references to gender or race are reduced to quick gags. The greatest confusion lies in the 'real is good' and 'big corporations bad' morality, which seems to want to critique the use of entertainment to distract the populace from real world politics and economics, but then says forget that, let's just have some fun!Aside from Rylance, the entire cast (even Ben Mendelsohn) struggle with two-dimensional characters and dialogue served with a whopping side-order of cheese. But is it bad writing or sly-satire of clunky 1980s teen movie dialogue? Still, this is Spielberg, and whilst it's over-puffed, over-stuffed and over-long, he delivers one stand-out sequence, serving up an amazing tribute to Stanley Kubrick, which also plays on how books and films are very different things indeed.Confused tone, message and target audience (it wants to be a family movie, but has a mature rating, with a few scenes that'll likely scare little ones, and a smattering of adult language), but the special effects CGI bonanza looks great. No drama or tension, but in terms of bold, brash, unashamed blockbusting popcorn munchers, Ready Player One definitely entertains.",8,1,4,25 April 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tomas Alfredson's adaptation of John Le Carré's novel, channels the author's atmosphere of moral decay with such admirable precision. . .
","Theaters would need only to pipe in cigarette smoke and the rattle of a failing Eastern Bloc HVAC system to make the experience immersive. . .Portrayals of the profession of intelligence in popular culture matter because they influence the perceptions of the customers of intelligence, congressional overseers, and even new hires into the business. The performance and capabilities of intelligence officers are often measured against standards established by film directors and novelists, from Brian De Palma to Tom Clancy. Perhaps one of the most enduring renderings of the profession is John Le Carré's Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which, since it was published in 1974, has been adapted to television, film, and two BBC radio series. The most recent addition to this collection is the Tomas Alfredson- directed film.Coming from a veteran of British intelligence, Le Carré's fiction offers a counterpoint to the glamorous spy tales of Ian Fleming and others. In his books, espionage is a high-stakes game of bluffs and double-bluffs played by unsmiling men in sparsely appointed rooms. Here, Gary Oldman plays one of the most famous of those unsmiling men, frequent Le Carré protagonist George Smiley, a British- intelligence lifer who, as the film opens, has been forced into semi-retirement following the high-profile failure, and subsequent death, of his mentor (John Hurt). When it becomes apparent that a mole remains in place in a position of power back at 'The Circus,' Oldman doesn't get to enjoy his time off for long.This review aims to address three questions concerning this addition: How does the movie differ from the novel and the 1979 BBC miniseries? (The BBC production is such a faithful rendering of the book that in this review the two will be regarded as essentially one version of the story.) Does the film realistically portray the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)—or any other major Western intelligence agency? Finally, is the movie likely to alter or reinforce popular perceptions of intelligence in general?Does the movie accurately depict the day-to-day life of the SIS? The upper tier of the SIS is reduced to six managers: their personalities and interactions have to stand for the accessible human factor of an obviously large and complex organisation. Strategic considerations and external politics are absent from their discussions. There are few hints about the size of SIS; at one point Smiley is told that the service has a total of 600 assets worldwide. It stretches credulity that these six men manage worldwide operations but play operational roles in the running of the asset Merlin or the dissemination of the Witchcraft product. The analogue would be CIA's second tier—the directors of the National Clandestine Service, the Directorate of Science and Technology, and the Directorate of Intelligence—meeting an asset, servicing a safe house, and briefing the product downtown. This organisational compression works very well at moving the story along in print, but images of senior executives sneaking through the shadows themselves is a stretch for anyone who works in the federal bureaucracy, much less in the Intelligence Community. They know the prevalent—and, after all, logical—tendency to delegate assignments down through the strata of skills and expertise.The movie's staging of the Circus offices is wonderfully effective: a claustrophobic world of crowded bullpens, ancient escalators, narrow corridors, and creaking dumbwaiters. It evoked for these greying reviewers their first experiences at CIA and NSA respectively, when paper files dominated the landscape. To exit the Circus, Smiley, and his boss, Control, weave their way through a maze of stairways, courtyards, and corridors. The editing of the film makes it seem like an hour's journey. It is consistent with Kim Philby's description of SIS Headquarters: 'A dingy building, a warren of wooden partitions and frosted glass window, served by an ancient lift.'The final intellectual stretch readers and viewers are asked to perform in each of the versions is in accepting that a major counterintelligence (CI) investigation could be carried out without the involvement—or even the knowledge—of CI professionals. The Cabinet Office official, Oliver Lacon, turns aside Smiley's suggestion to turn the inquiry over to MI5: The Minister won't have that. You know perfectly well how he and Alleline feel about the competition. Rightly, too, if I may say so. A lot of ex-colonial administrators ploughing through Circus papers: you might as well bring in the Army to investigate the Navy. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan compress Le Carré's labyrinthine plot, but don't simplify it. Its dealings and double-dealings will probably be better understood on a second viewing, but it only takes one to appreciate Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as a film. After establishing an atmosphere of nearly unbearable dread, Alfredson keeps thickening and chilling it. There's less snow here than in the Swedish director's previous project, the coming-of-age vampire film Let The Right One In, but Tinker shares its pervasive coldness. Much of the action transpires against a backdrop of overcast skies, Gray institutional buildings, and anonymous apartment buildings, which look the same on either side of the Iron Curtain. There's a sly bit of commentary in that detail, as if the Cold War had drained the light and beauty from its super-powered antagonists' homelands. But the toll is just as evident in Oldman's face as he stares past those around him, analysing the information, planning his next move, thinking more than most, and feeling only what he still lets himself feel.",9,2,2,27 June 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Spike Lee's powerful response to a troubled time

Ron's conversations on the phone with Duke are some of the most memorable and amusing in the movie, with the cop and his pals guffawing at the pomposity and ignorance of the Grand Wizard.The film will tickle you at one moment, and the next hit you with some of the foulest and most hateful language a person could use against black people, Jews and women. It's chilling, literally, like a dunk in a cold bath - and it's also impossible to pretend that you would have to go far to hear this sort of rhetoric used today. Welcome to 4chan, ladies and gentlemen.",8,9,19,15 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Tom Holland gives the best on-screen portrayal of teenage Spidey in a not-so-friendly-neighbourhood-plot, yet!
","Spider-Man: Homecoming's only achievement is that it makes you forget it's the third different Spider-Man – and second reboot – in less than 20 years. We saw Tom Holland's take on Peter Parker steal the show in Captain America: Civil War, but his first solo outing lets him loose and the result is a joy to behold. No chance of Spidey fatigue, here.Marvel movies succeed because they're not just superhero movies. Captain America: The Winter Soldier was a '70s conspiracy thriller; Guardians of the Galaxy a space opera. Enter Spider-Man: Homecoming, a frothy and witty John Hughes high school comedy that just happens to feature a superhero or two.It's charming. It's hilarious. And it proves that Holland is the best on-screen teenage Spidey in a not-so-friendly-neighbourhood-plot, yet.After the grand-scale conflict of Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man goes back to basics as a hometown hero. Cut to two months later and Peter is still waiting for that call, while living with Aunt May. Instead of battling the forces of evil, he's battling the usual high school issues, including unrequited love with senior Liz and popularity woes with his best friend Ned.But Peter soon spots his chance to impress Tony when he stumbles upon a black market weapons deal. He links the weapons to arms dealer Adrian Toomes (Michael Keaton/Batman gone Rogue now?), AKA Vulture, who has been modifying alien technology left over from Avengers' battles into deadly weapons.So, with the help of Ned, Peter defies Tony's orders to stay in school and sets out to become more than just your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man by stopping Vulture in his tracks, even if it means risking the lives of everyone he cares about.Let's get one of the main concerns out of the way first: this is very much a Spider-Man movie and not Iron Man 3.5. In fact, Tony is barely in it, popping by every now and then to play reluctant mentor, but often leaving it to Happy (you know, Jon Favreau) to keep an eye on Peter. It means that Holland is centre stage and it's suited to him. With pitch-perfect comic timing, his Peter is an endearing, believable teenager whose enthusiasm is impossible to resist.It helps that Holland is surrounded by an excellent young cast that you're happy to spend time with. There's good chemistry between Holland and Batalon, but Zendaya is the revelation, doing a lot with a little and delivering big laughs as Michelle. Homecoming's strongest set piece comes when Peter's classmates are in danger, a testament to the affection built up from their engaging performances.That set piece sees Spidey swing to the rescue when his classmates are trapped in the Washington Monument. The tense sequence makes good use of vertigo-inducing angles to add genuine peril — a rarity in a superhero movie — without forgetting character beats. Homecoming falls into a common Marvel complaint with a messy, overblown climactic set piece but, even then, manages to make it have a personal edge, much like the final battle in Civil War.But what Homecoming does avoid is Marvel's villain problem, with Vulture a better version of Iron Man 2's Whiplash, more grounded and empathetic. Keaton's performance avoids scenery chewing and is all the better for it, especially in one menacing confrontation with Peter. That's about as dark as the movie gets, though. This isn't Spider- Man 3.Homecoming also confidently deals with the reboot problem of telling the same story over again. So we don't have to see Uncle Ben die for the 100th time, even if his death is alluded to, and Peter's origin story is dealt with in a fun conversation with Ned. The confidence also extends to Marvel taking the Pi$$ out of itself a bit, with the Cap being the Butt of the joke, especially.Throw one of Marvel's best post-credits scenes into the mix, and you have one of their most entertaining outings to date. Spider-Man: Homecoming leaves you wanting to swing wherever Holland's Spidey goes next.(SIDEBAR: Tom Holland dazzles surely but I've seen better a Spider- Man Movie than this one).",7,8,21,4 July 2017
Closer," If you believe in love at first sight, take a look at closer.
","It seems there's love behind everything. Love shaped to resemble anything you can think of. And all too often, love made out to be the prize. I distrust anything and everything that makes love out to be immaculate and a source of endless joy. Subtle strokes of musical genius presented under the name 'The Blower's Daughter' by Damien Rice, accompanied two versions of Natalie Portman walking in utter self-confidence towards the audience (just short of The Purple Rose of Cairo)' Two versions of the same character, in fact, the person you don't know and the person you thought you knew. The story, or rather the vignettes sandwiched between those versions, and the metamorphosis that blended them close to seamlessly, were impressive all on their own. An uncompromising 'wake up and smell the (bitter) coffee and drink it down to the last sip while you're at it' sort of cinematic experience. A movie that, while mainstream, manages to bypass every mainstream hint of restraint and shows it to you like it is. No air brushing. No sugar coating. Here. Love isn't always pretty. Love can come your way escorted by black sheep: jealousy, selfishness, possessiveness, pride, cruelty, inconsiderateness, shamelessness, corroding dissatisfaction. Love - 'real' love as we've come to know it from our tour of the sugar coating factory that can be human creativity - often has a hard time standing a chance.",9,1,2,1 May 2017
Suicide Squad," For a SQUAD of an impressive-high-profile cast, not the best SUICIDE movie.
","Initially stylish but ultimately ridiculous and chaotic, the DC comics-based adventure 'Suicide Squad' also features some dubious moral values. Add to that the film's lurid atmosphere overall and its appeal, along with its appropriate audience, dwindles still further.And then, straight out of left field, there's Katana (Karen Fukuhara), a lady samurai whose deceased husband's soul is trapped in her sword. For no very clear reason, she winds up tagging along on the quest to quell the Enchantress' sibling as well.Writer-director David Ayer's film is barely passable while the action is chugging along. But scenes attempting to give moral shading to the characters -- and bonding them as a pseudo-family -- misfire completely. Viewers are supposed to be impressed by the fact that career hit-man Deadshot loves his young daughter, Zoe (Shailyn Pierre-Dixon), for instance. More persuasively, Diablo expresses his penitence for having misused the fire that shoots from his hands at will by refusing to employ this supernatural gift -- at least, that is, until the script really needs him to for the sake of an explosive finale.If there's any good news to be salvaged from this mess, it's that casting Viola Davis as a tough-as-nails government bureaucrat works quite well. Davis plays hard-bitten intelligence agent Amanda Waller. Waller's pet project is the creation of the combat team of the title, an ensemble of violent villains she's determined to spring from prison and put at the service of the government. Oh, did I forgot to mention, Margot Robbie? Come on, even the Joker fell for her surprisingly honest and accurate performance in this piece. Overall, enjoyable indeed. But nevertheless, for a SQUAD of an impressive- high-profile cast, not the best SUICIDE movie.",7,1,2,15 December 2016
Taxi Driver," 'Are you talking' to me?' —is one such line that will stun you forever!
","Some motion pictures produce the uncanny sensation of returning the spectator's gaze. Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver—a movie in which the most celebrated line asks the audience, 'Are you talking' to me?'—is one such film. It came, it saw, it zapped the body politic right between the eyes.The 12th top-grossing movie of 1976, Taxi Driver was not just a hit but, like Psycho or Bonnie and Clyde, an event in American popular culture—perhaps even an intervention. Inspired by one failed political assassination (the 1972 shooting of presidential hopeful George Wallace), it inadvertently motivated another (the 1981 attempt on President Ronald Reagan). The movie further established its 33-year- old director as both Hollywood's designated artist and, after Taxi Driver was awarded the Palme d'Or at Cannes, an international sensation—the decisive influence on neo–New Wave filmmakers as varied as Spike Lee, Wong Kar-wai, and Quentin Tarantino.Brilliant and yet repellent, at times even hateful, Taxi Driver inspired understandable ambivalence. (At Cannes, the announcement that it had won the Palme d'Or was greeted with boos.) How could reviewers not be wary? Taxi Driver is nakedly opposed even to itself, as well as the culture that produced it. For Travis, all movies are essentially pornographic; had he met his creators, he would surely, his history of Times Square, consider them purveyors of 'scum and filth.' It's the slow deliberation with which this lunatic kicks over his TV and terminates his connection to social reality that signals his madness—and the filmmaker's.No nostalgia, though: In other aspects, the world of Taxi Driver is recognisably ours. Libidinal politics, celebrity worship, sexual exploitation, the fetishization of guns and violence, racial stereotyping, the fear of foreigners—not to mention the promise of apocalyptic religion—all remain. Taxi Driver lives. See it again. And try to have a nice day!",10,3,5,31 October 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," One of my favorites from last year!
","Martin McDonagh is one of my favorite directors and from his first two films, I was certain I knew his brand: wildly witty, self-aware nihilism; the irreverence of Tarantino and panache of Guy Ritchie blended with quaaludes to a sweet, sludgy black. In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths were both favorites of mine, but their message - if one could charitably call it that - was 'Let's watch the world burn through a fogged-up funhouse mirror.'Three Billboards is a different, more mature animal. It has all the cleverness, and gleeful blasphemy, of his earlier films - unquotable monologues, manic fits of disproportionate violence. But it also has something serious to say, and is willing to take its brooding time saying it. In that sense, it's hard not to compare it to his brother's film Calvary. If Calvary asked the question 'What use is faith in a world whose institutions fail to earn it?', Three Billboards asks 'What good is anger when there's no one to absorb the blame?' It's a story of characters filled with righteous indignation and no proper place to funnel it. Mildred Hayes can't believe her daughter's murder hasn't been solved. Sgt Dixon can't believe his boss's good name is being dragged through the mud. In typical playwright fashion, improbably heightened events are used to tease out real emotions from real people: the point isn't what happens, it's how these characters would respond if it had. Perfectly scripted and wonderfully realized (Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson are particularly great), those responses are always earned. If you go in expecting an A-to-B storyline with lovable heroes, you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you're ready to soak in a few hours of gray, you'd be hard pressed to do better than this. One of my favorites from last year.",9,4,8,20 February 2018
Lion," Nicole Kidman, if unfortunate, right now, the 'Best Supporting Actress' Oscar must be hers to lose.
","Real stories of a somebody-got-famous are a dime in a dozen and about a thousand in couple of thousand in Cinema history. But the one in this film, involves no one you've ever heard of, doesn't star a soul you'll recognise for its first 40 minutes, and will rip you into a thousand pieces before it's over. 'Lion' tells the story of a lost boy: a five-year-old Indian called 'Saroo,' who grew up in the 1980s in the area around Khandwa. The film begins with him pilfering lumps of coal off a train with his older brother, 'Guddu,' and selling them to buy food. By the end of the first reel, these two are thousands of miles apart, wholly by mistake. Left sleeping one night on a railway station bench, Saroo woke up alone and scared, and stumbled onto a decommissioned passenger train. Before he knew it, he was speeding his way to Calcutta, with no one to help, no Bengali to explain, and a place name for his home town that no one at the other end recognised. This is a true story; a pretty inspiring and incredible one at that. It's a story of two halves, the first half full of the colour and drama of young Saroo's Indian childhood, with the second half (covering the adoption by a compassionate Sue and her husband John; Portrayed by Nicole Kidman and David Wenham respectively) focusing on the psychological toll of dislocation and loss of identity. Handled with intelligence and subtlety, this is a powerfully engaging drama.The excellent script, by the Australian writer Luke Davies, sticks rigidly to Saroo's own point of view as days, months, and eventually whole decades elapse with him effectively orphaned through freak circumstance. It's derived from a 2012 memoir by the grown Saroo Brierley, called A Long Way Home. He can only imagine the agony his mother and brother must have gone through, endlessly searching. So twenty five years later, armed with only a handful of memories, his unwavering determination, and a revolutionary technology known as Google Earth, he sets out to find his lost family and finally return to his first home. While Rooney Mara has a fairly limited function as Saroo's girlfriend, Nicole Kidman enriches the film enormously. It's a sterling, supportive performance by Kidman (who is one of my most favourite actresses). The script never lunges for cheap drama by forcing Saroo into a binary choice between mothers, and the most complex beats are about tip- toeing around, often counter-productively, to avoid hurt or betrayal.Patel in a role (and film) which infinitely improve on his breakthrough in Slumdog Millionaire. But Nicole Kidman is a fascinatingly strained figure, often barely keeping her grip. Right now, the Best Supporting Actress Oscar must be hers to lose.",9,0,0,12 February 2017
Nightcrawler," ' I'd like to think if you're seeing me you're having the worst day of your life. ' – Louis Bloom.
","But I'd like to say that if you're seeing him in that movie, you're having the best day of your life (or weekend at least). And you'll scream your lungs out with these words: What exactly the f*ck is up with the folks at the Academy? Good Ol' Jake never gets his nod at the Oscars unless he's Broken-some-backs?'Nightcrawler(s)' is a term for freelance cameramen, seen here roaming LA after dark in search of lurid stories to sell to TV: as the dictum goes: 'If it bleeds, it leads.'Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a venturesome beginner who demonstrates appallingly great at the exchange, being completely committed and hyper-composed, with the moral second thoughts of a moray eel.The experiences about the ethical opportunity of TV news are not really novel, yet what gives Nightcrawler its class is Gyllenhaal's alarming, now and then coldly comic execution as the beguiled screw- up, always vacantly gushing certifiable administration manual talk. Yet, underneath the enthusiastic beaver brilliance is a non domesticated soul, showed up – oil slicked hair, the thinness of a sleep deprived person austere and a glare that appears to be painted on to his eyelids, as though Lou is a recording gadget for all time exchanged on.There's solid support from Riz Ahmed as Lou's hapless en-roll, however the genuine shock is a show-taking Rene Russo as Nina, a hard- nibbled news manager on the falling flat station that offers Lou his reprieve. In an uncommon scene, Lou welcomes her to supper, consults for better terms and, as a major issue, demands this extensively more established lady laying down with him; the enthusiastic (and oedipal) fencing between the two is awfully convincing.Mental extravagance aside, Nightcrawler works adequately as an incline thriller, with the city night given a cool, metallic sheen by cinematographer Robert Elswit. It may not be pivotal, but rather Nightcrawler emerges as an appreciated peculiarity today, reviewing the kind of harsh dramatisations once made by executives, for example, Michael Mann, Sidney Lumet or James B Harris. Gilroy marginally blows it with a group satisfying climactic pursue, yet this is an appropriately grown-up excitement; and it contains the most critical new beast in sight, being the most miserably human.Louis Bloom is pretty much pure evil. Worse than that, he is the kind of pure evil that you might expect to find living right next door to you. Though ultimately just a man, Bloom has long abandoned any semblance of humanity in favour of pursuing any venture that will benefit him and him alone.This philosophy eventually attracts Bloom to the world of paparazzi-style news recording.The worst part is that 'Nightcrawler' leads us to believe that Bloom will ultimately get his in the end, but that doesn't prove to be the case. At all. Instead, we come to find that Bloom will not only avoid prosecution for his various crimes, but that he's found himself a very profitable place in the world of violent news reporting. Things could not have gone better for this madman.",10,0,1,19 May 2017
Baby Driver," All those fusses you're hearing about this Film ain't fake – It's 100% pure class of Entertainment!
","This film blends awesome action with a superior soundtrack in an original and logical way that makes it all an incredibly fun thrill ride, where the tunes bring the audience into the protagonist's head in a uniquely fun way that I've never experienced before.Imagine if OK Go videos were full-length films and you've only cracked half the technical excitement inside of Baby Driver. The 80's aesthetic that Wright is channelling extends far beyond just some of the song choices. It permeates from every choice in sets design, car models, wardrobe and even the characters. True to the colour palette of the decades the film is paying homage to, every aspect of the film is vibrant. The colours pop and draw us into the film like moths to a very inviting flame.The beauty of the film isn't just in the physical pieces, but in how Wright uses them in a complex ballet of moving parts to tell the story. This includes the often comical interactions with characters that are themselves semi-anachronistic archetypes of films past. We have the Bonny and Clyde duo working with the mercurial, unhinged gangster and the mob boss in businessman skin. There's even the misunderstood hero with a rough past falling for someone whose speed is the opposite of his own. The great unifying force that brings Baby Driver together goes beyond the way they interact with each other and includes how they interact with their surroundings.In addition to the edge-of-your-seat car action, Baby Driver is also the best and most convincing love story that you are likely to see in the cinema this year – making it an almost perfect date-movie, in that you'll likely fall in love with its leads, Baby (Ansel Elgort) and Debora (Lily James).Without getting into the film's minutia, which is revealed in flashbacks as the narrative progresses, Baby is an indentured servant of sorts to a criminal kingpin known as Doc (Kevin Spacey), who masterminds bank heists with the young man as the getaway driver.But, Baby is not just any wheel-man. He has supernatural skills behind the wheel, powered by an iPod mix that fuels and focuses his special abilities. Through the film's soundtrack, you hear the tunes he hears and you will believe a man can fly – through traffic – going any direction – as if he were Superman on wheels.Like any good anti-hero, our man just has to do one more job and then he's out and can walk away from 'the life' forever and, of course, things are never that easy. Just as Baby meets diner waitress, Debora, and falls madly in love, his world goes uncontrollably awry.In the past, Wright has always included a core theme into his films that everything else revolves around. This time it isn't zombies, aliens or even a cabal of evil exes, but something more relivable: moving music and fast cars. We've all been in the car when our favourite song comes on and we can't help but loudly belt it out while doing some very misguided form of choreography when you probably have both hands on the wheel. Or maybe it's just me? Either way, use that image and increase it exponentially.The film's choreography and car-epigraphy (what I lovingly call car movements set to music, duh) treats every object, including the cars, as a sort of character or an extension of their expression. Every action is synchronised to create a perfect punctuation for that scene. Every song choice mirrors and embodies the emotion of the moment.",9,20,38,27 June 2017
Split," Split garnered controversy for its alleged stigmatisation of mental illness but it was worth it!
","Let's start with James McAvoy who definitely gives, in my opinion, the best performance of his career. As Kevin Wendell Crumb, a sufferer of dissociated identity disorder (DID), who has 23 prominently different personalities, each with something peculiar or dangerous for his captives. Kevin's body chemistry changes with each personality, resulting in his 24th and final personality, 'The Beast', being capable of superhuman levels of strength, speed, mobility (allowing him to scale walls and ceilings), and a voracious hunger for human flesh. Yeah, sounds a bit too risky for all that to be the main plot- line for a film doesn't it?Well the film itself was as risky as ever as it garnered controversy for its alleged stigmatisation of a real-life mental illness which happens to be the most controversial psychiatric disorder, with no clear consensus on diagnostic criteria or treatment.McAvoy, from a general point of view, is absolutely incredible in this film, and he drove it all the way home. He had to inhabit so many different personalities for this role, and every single time he shifts, you can tell by his posture, the way he moves, and the way he talks. He's so automatic and smooth in his shifts, but he never stays in transition. It's instantaneous, and he gives everything he has to every second of screen time he gets. By the end of the film, it's almost like we've grown accustom to this man as compared to James McAvoy,and I forgot he was even in the movie. I also have to give Anya Taylor-Joy a ton of credit. The cute lady perfectly pulls off the stress, horror, and shock that her character needs to go through. I really didn't like Morgan, but she wasn't the problem with that film, but I've had a huge talent-crush on her afterwards. Seriously, she's incredible in The Witch!. I think she has so much ahead of her, especially in the horror and thriller genres. Next, this movie looks absolutely beautiful. The colours are dark and dreary, but they're used so well, and the lighting is perfect to set mood and to make an incredible looking movie. Shyamalan also uses the camera well for the most part. The movie has so many amazing looking still frames that allow you to think about everything going on. It doesn't need a fast-paced cut or dynamic sound design to pull out the thrills. We just see a lot of shots that linger on a character or a setting, and it gives the perfect amount of information and time necessary to process ideas yet still leave questions spinning in your mind. The first half is where this movie really excels in that area, and Shyamalan crafts the thrills so quietly and delicately that you don't even realise the small frog that's building in your throat. Split shows that Shyamalan can still do it when he stays small and returns to his roots. That talent is still inside him, and it came out for this movie.The first half and a few more is really, very good, and can blow you away. But to be frank, the reason why the first half of this movie is so breathtaking is because it's where the director, 'Shyamalan' excels. Well, now to be really really honest, if the first half is where he goes back to his classic thrills, the second half is where he comes unglued and lets everything fly. He did such an incredible job staying contained and quiet in the first half, but all of a sudden the movie introduces a few twists and turns that didn't work for me. Twists and turns are to be expected in a movie like this, but if Shyamalan continued on his path of containment, he probably would have been better off. I'll definitely outline which twists and turns didn't work for me in the spoiler- filled review, but for right now I'll just say that it was a combination of interjecting scenes and story arcs. Next, this movie has definite pacing issues. Overall, I like Split more and more as I think about it, (don't worry you'll do it too!) and I can't wait to see what Shyamalan is going to do in the future. I think Split is going to hold up in the same way that Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense, and most of Signs does. It's not even a movie that proves Shyamalan's not a dud. It's a pretty darn good movie, and it has to get you excited for an Unbreakable series. Who knows? Maybe Elijah Price comes back and teams up with The Beast to be the brains and brawn against David Dunn. We've been waiting for an Unbreakable sequel, and Split gives us some hope for that. It's also a great origin story of a villain, and another great Shyamalan thriller.Seriously, GO Watch it TWICE!",8,2,10,10 April 2017
Collateral," Cruise's most nuanced performance of the modern era, or any era of his career for that matter!
","First off, let me remind you: Tom Cruise is the 'movie star.' If you didn't know that already, then, hey, welcome to the planet earth (an apology in advance for most of my nonsense). A staple of cheesy '80s movies (Riskey Business, Cocktail, Top Gun, All the Right Moves, etc.) he escaped into the next two decades to front some very fine and profitable motion pictures and as of 2017, become one of, if not THE, highest paid actor in Hollywood (he is actually but the media won't claim it because he told them not to). But merely being paid well for acting doesn't mean you can actually act (but let's not point fingers shall we?). With the impending release of the Mummy, that same action movie with a different twist, Collateral is one of my favourite Tom Cruise movies and where he demonstrated his best work being on the opposite side of the law the main antagonist. AND it's right on the money!Collateral is hands down Tom Cruise's most nuanced performance of the modern era, or any era of his career for that matter. Playing off of mostly Jamie Foxx during the entire run of the film, Cruise plays the role of Vincent. He's just a guy who's in Los Angeles for a couple of days, with some time to kill. Actually, he has some people to kill as well, and he forces Foxx's character of Max to ferry him around from murder scene to murder scene in order to finish the jobs at hand. Naturally, Max puts up a fight and tries to escape with some rather crafty and unconventional means.However, Vincent wouldn't be very good at his job if he wasn't able to improvise and adapt to his environment, which means Max is going to have to put up a huge fight to escape his supposed fate.The reason that Vincent is Tom Cruise's best — and probably most important — performance of his career is that it's one of the rare moments where he plays someone we're not supposed to root for. Sure, he previously got to flex his villain muscles in Interview With The Vampire, but Lestat has more of a comedic edge to him that makes the character more enjoyable when he murders people in cold blood.Jamie Foxx's Character, Max is a decent guy, a taxi driver who is sort of in love with one of his passengers. He knows where she live since he's the one who carried her around in that taxi a coupe of times but can't seem to build up the courage to ask her out. Cruse's character, Vincent, on the other hand, is an existential sociopath. He wonders what our place on this Earth is all about, and so far the answers he's come up with aren't strong enough for him to stop killing people.The man is goal focused to the end, even taking some hits as he chases Max down during the film's action-packed finale. And just when you think he's about to close in for the kill, he's gunned down by sheer, dumb, cosmic luck. In that final moment, he realises that it's all for nothing. No one will notice he was there, because it was what he'd always aimed for. His goal was always to leave no trace behind, and he succeeds admirably.While he's the film's villain, and a cold-heart-ed killer; Tom Cruise manages to have some of that mischievous fun that he had with Lestat so many years ago.His performance as Vincent walks a tightrope of calm logic, fierce rage, and grinning idiot. Yet somehow, he gets you to feel just a little sorry for him at the end, as he's slumped over on that train – which calls back to the story told earlier in the film. I hope Cruise and director Michael Mann get to work together again at some point in the future, as this film brought out some of the best qualities of why he still remains an acting force of nature. If you've never seen Collateral, or haven't experienced it in a good long while, I highly recommend you do so. The film is as fresh today as it was back in 2004.",9,1,2,19 May 2017
Dunkirk," Dunkirk is an unrelenting Cinema triumph! (unmissable!)
","Watching Dunkirk at an IMAX Cinema is reluctant to be an unforgettable experience (for me it was, surely). Filled with unrelenting tension. From start to finish there isn't a minute's respite. With each gun battle, torpedo attack, aerial bombing and explosion, there's end-to-end action which is in equal parts gripping, thrilling and stunning. Expect your heart to hammer for the entire 107 minutes. I didn't hear a cough, sniff, barely an intake of breath from my fellow captivated cinema-goers. Nolan's Dunkirk will suck you in and spit you back out - in the best way. As a Briton, this was seriously important, valuing the details. The magnificent history of Britain has tales to fill almost every book in the world and this powerful document of an era, the World War II and one of Britain's greatest military expenditure (which was actually a retreat by all means), told in stark terms by the Dark Knight director, a Brit-phenomenon himself, Christopher Nolan was more than overwhelming and satisfying. How the evacuation of Dunkirk in May 1940 turned out: how nearly 400,000 mainly British (which means mostly English but don't forget our Scottish brothers) troops escaped from the beach and harbour of a northern French port while being bombarded by the NazisSurely, my main expectation with war movies is the terrifying gore (thanks Spielberg). Blood, organs spilling everywhere, limbs blown off; all an accurate depiction of war but just so awful to watch. There's hardly a drop of visible blood spilled in Dunkirk but it is still one of the most brutal and powerful war films I've ever seen.Steven Spielberg might have owned the Normandy beach landings while Clint Eastwood owns Iwo Jima, and now, Nolan has authored the definitive cinematic version of Dunkirk. Unlike those other battles, however, this last was not a conventional victory, but more of a salvaged retreat, as the German offensive forced a massive evacuation of English troops early in World War II. And unlike those other two directors, Nolan is only nominally interested in the human side of the story as he puts his stamp on the heroic rescue operation, offering a bravura virtual-eyewitness account from multiple perspectives — one that fragments and then craftily interweaves events as seen from land, sea and air. Coming from Nolan, the film retains the same legendary scale but it's blended with a more intimate and structurally fascinating project like his earlier works Memento and Following. Anyone who ever saw Memento knows Nolan is a fan of playing with time and structure, incorporating a pulsating suspense factor even without spelling anything out for the audience. Again, like a true master of cinema, he lets it all come together in sometimes surprising but enormously effective and even emotional ways. With sparse dialogue and an emphasis on three separate angles on the Dunkirk operation, Nolan creates three smaller elements that lead to a much bigger picture.No action movie is complete without an epic score and Christopher Nolan has once again teamed up with the infamous Hans Zimmer following the success of their collaboration for The Dark Knight Rises. Given the lack of dialogue, the score is the 'leading character in the film.' The soundtrack is the star of the film. With that, the film divulges into three interlocking chapters but is told from three different perspectives. There's 'The Mole, One Week', taking place on the harbour wall from which thousands were rescued and where we see a commander (Kenneth Branagh) trying to make sense of the disaster. There's 'The Sea, One Day', where we see civilian sailor Mark Rylance set off from the English south coast. And there's 'The Air, One Hour', in which RAF pilot Farrier (Tom Hardy) engages in dogfights with the Luftwaffe. There are other characters – young troops on the beach played Fionn Whitehead and Harry Styles; a disturbed soldier (Cillian Murphy) rescued from the hull of a sinking warship. Yet as much as these familiar faces give us something to grab onto, this is a war film without heroes or a straightforward story. The event is the story. If that means some of the film feels chilly, a little distant, it's at the expense of easy sympathy and simplistic drama.Sir. Churchill called Dunkirk a 'miracle'. The newspapers tagged it a 'triumph'. Nolan resists any punch-the-air celebration. Hans Zimmer's score scrapes away at you throughout, piling unease on unease before flirting with Elgar's war remembrance anthem 'Nimrod' and backing off, as if embarrassed. Questions are posed about the British government: a survivor asks a RAF pilot back home, 'Where the hell were you?'. The older generation owes a debt to the young: 'That old bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye,' observes one soldier. We hear Sir. Churchill's 'We shall fight on the beaches' speech, but the words come from the mouth of a dazed soldier, not the PM. There's no glory here, just survival. It's a sombre tribute that makes a distant war feel uncomfortably present.What was so brilliant about this war movie, as opposed to other blockbuster war movies, was the lack of any cheesy back story. There was no handsome soldier trying to get home to his childhood sweetheart, no lieutenant attempting to rescue a long-lost brother, no young boys crying for their mums, no romance - just a lot of actual war. The film was all the more real and heartbreaking for it.Never mind that Britain if stood alone at that precise point during the war, this film is like the Brexit version of British identity in a nutshell: proudly isolated, independent, not European, and strongest everywhere in the world.Go watch this in an IMAX Cinema if you can. This is a 2017 must- watch. A must see if you're English. A must see if you're Scottish. A must see if you're British.",8,5,14,26 July 2017
The Intouchables," One of the best Foreign films I've ever seen, period.
","I don't often get the chance to take in foreign cinema, but in the case of The Intouchables, I'm reminded of why I enjoy every opportunity to watch something fairly magical unfold on the screen. Sure, it sounds cheesy, but I have to say, the more foreign films I see, the more I find that I truly enjoy.The Intouchables, written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, is a total wild card, and it works in ways that are completely indescribable. The sense of purity and genuinity is evident throughout the film, and is wholeheartedly embraced by the audience. The Intouchables is based on the true-life events of Philippe (François Cluzet), a wealthy quadriplegic, and Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with a troubled background, who Philippe hires as his caretaker. The film follows the interesting relationship that develops between these two men - one of mutual respect and true friendship.While the foreign reception of this movie has been overwhelmingly successful, the stateside opinions of this movie have been fairly varied, most of which find this movie to be racist, demeaning, or otherwise offensive. I feel as though these opinions are somewhat ridiculous, as the movie itself doesn't ever make race an issue; unless you are trying to read into the fact that the white man is rich and the black man is poor, these men are more peers that initially meets the eye. The unexpected companionship of these two men results in fantastic comedic opportunities, and not only are they hilarious, but they are touching and emotionally raw.The true magic in this film shines through by way of the incredible acting talent, and their obvious fervor for their craft. It is no surprise that both actors were awarded the honor of Best Actor at the 2011 Tokyo International Film Festival; additionally, Omar Sy's performance as Driss helped him to edge out Jean Dujardin (The Artist) for the César Award for Best Actor. It is rare to find two individuals that have the connection that Sy and Cluzet share on screen, and their interaction is wholly refreshing.This and the remaining components of the movie all seamlessly work together to provide a satisfying backdrop for the heartwarming story. At one point, Philippe's lawyer displays concern over the choice of Driss as Philippe's caretaker, due to his questionable background. Philippe indicated that such was of no concern, and he was merely grateful to be treated as a person, not as someone with a disability.While I understand that many American viewers will maintain a perception that this movie is offensive on some level, I feel as though the way we as Americans view race is severely different from those in other countries. While I don't consider myself an expert or 'advocate' for awareness of racial discrimination, I find that the perpetuation of such through the media is unacceptable. Still, I think that this movie warrants an open mind, as it ventures beyond the obvious issues, and touches on a level of humanity that surpasses the pulling of the racism card.To be quite honest, this movie was probably one of the best movies I have seen all year. From a fantastic cast to an emotionally touching story that doesn't get lost or muddled in translation, The Intouchables has leaped its way to the top of my list for possible Oscar nominations (which isn't a far stretch of the imagination). I would definitely recommend this as a movie to put on your 'must see' list - I don't think you will be disappointed.",10,2,6,28 November 2018
Captain America: Civil War," BEST Marvel Movie so Far!
","'Captain America Vs Iron Man! Wrong. It's Bucky Barnes Vs T'Challa - Nope, wrong again. It's Bucky Barnes Vs Tony Stark - Oh, wait, it's Steve Rogers' movie. Avenge!'The preface should tell you what the film is all about. Yes, it's one hell of a film!But I'll show you how to criticise it, still. With his propaganda-poster jawline, WW2 promotional adverts to fitness inspirational videos and air of unimpeachable nobility, Captain America (Chris Evans) has always been one of the duller members of the Marvel universe.. Which is probably why, although this film or 'the Avengers 3 with a Boy Spidey and a giant Ant?' - outing bears his name, the film-makers have press-ganged (almost) every spare ounce of Marvel muscle to back him up. Oh yeah, it's not entirely the 'American War Mongering' spectacle titled Civil War (with Captain USA). Ignore the crap above, this is, as it should be, very much Cap's movie and Evans' Steve Rogers proves he's the heart and soul of the MCU. And no matter what, he's a good man - who has to make tough calls, who's essentially alone in the world despite the company of his superhero pals. His battle of ideologies with Tony is compelling, but it never quite evolves past the same argument being repeated throughout and both sides doing something to show why the other might be right. Guilt over collateral damage is what prompts some of them – Tony Stark, Natasha Romanoff – to sign an accord ceding responsibility for their actions to the UN. But Steve Rogers, AKA Captain America, demurs. The freedom to deploy a spot of unilateral ass-kicking where needed is what makes the Captain so great, and by extension America, also, great. But let's not get into that shall we? The scene is set for an internecine Avengers smack- down; the plot – hooked on an under- cooked vengeful grudge – is of secondary importance to the opportunity to watch them knock titanium alloy spots off each other. Fortunately, the zinging screenplay, by Marvel regulars Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, hits home almost as frequently as the punches.The Hulk-sized gap in the lineup is filled by an engagingly geeky Spider-Man-boy-dork (Tom Holland, a promising taster for the stand- alone upcoming Spider-Movie - where Captain is returning the favour by making an unusual cameo, I think, based on the trailer). While the little guy, the ANT-MAN got a round of applause in most of the theatres/cinemas, including the one where I was at and I didn't even try to be cynical about it. It was great. Downey turns in an uncharacteristically morose turn as Tony, even moodier than he was in Age of Ultron and in parts of Iron Man 3. He certainly has his good reasons for being down, although it does sap the movie of some of the charm and fun Iron Man has long been relied on to deliver. His differing ideology from Cap's is the crux of Civil War's philosophical and literal battle, but, like 2016's Other Superhero v Superhero Movie, this heady and repetitive debate also grinds down the pacing at times. Between Civil War and Batman v Superman, hopefully both filmmakers and audiences have fulfilled their need to address the issue of collateral damage and can once again embrace what superhero movies do best, namely pure escapism. That's not at all to say superhero movies can't or shouldn't address heroes' moral culpability or echo real world concerns, but continually lecturing to and piling the guilt onto the protagonists (and, by extension, the viewer) for superheroes doing what superheroes do is growing rather tedious and, frankly, taking the fun out of the genre.As much as Cap and Tony's relationship is put to the test here, it's ultimately Cap's Bro-man-tic devotion to Bucky that trumps all else. Sebastian Stan once again finds the humanity in his cold warrior killer, and even gets a rival to Cap's affection in Anthony Mackie's Falcon. Their relationship is played mostly for comic relief to help offset the overwhelmingly tense and even gloomy tone of the movie. Know who else brings the chuckles to Civil War? Your friendly neighbourhood and highly anticipated new addition to the MCU... (Hint: He was beaten by some crappy insect).Overall, the Civil War does a far better job of juggling so many different characters than AOU or even X-Men. Sure it has a very complicated story-line but it's one hell of a film which you don't want to miss out on. While memorising who is in which of the colour- coded, armour-plated exoskeletons can be challenging, the sheer force of so much super-powered personality on screen makes for a blast of a movie. And the best one from Marvel, yet.*A 'Spoiler' not necessary need to be 'Alerted' about: Stan Lee appears to mispronounce his own-created character's name: Tony Stark to Tony Something else!",9,1,3,29 April 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," A darker spin on the Harry Potter universe, in a visual feast and engaging cinema!
","Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a beautiful film. It looks like a cross between an Edward Hopper painting and Raoul Walsh's gangster pictures of the 1940s but with a heavy dose of magic in the foreground to boot. To watch David Yates' film makes for a wonderful juxtaposition of styles akin to the finest steam-punk.Set in 1920s New York, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them follows Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne, fresh from his Oscar win for The Theory of Everything) as he attempts to hunt down some mysterious monsters who threaten to unravel the secret magic community and user in tragedy.As this is from the pen of Harry Potter novelist JK Rowling, you can expect an ensemble cast of friendly and shady characters interacting in their own world of intricate details that is as threatening as it is tempting. It's Garden of Eden stuff on a Hollywood scale - something that David Yates mastered in the final Harry Potter films he helm- ed.In fact, it's a surprisingly dark affair with social satire undertones that border on Terry Gilliam territory (who would make an excellent choice of director for future films in the inevitable franchise).The less you know about Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them going in, the better so I won't spoil the surprises for the sake of this review but I will say that if you enjoy well crafted fantasy with gorgeous production values and a twee tone, you can't go far wrong with this. But of course try to have patience because these types of films need a little more concentrated viewing then most other.",8,0,1,10 April 2017
Jackie," Natalie Portman's show! She is the MAN here (that's right!)
","The murder of JFK has become, to many (not only Americans), a parable of our time. Not as legendary as a Shakespearian tragedy but nevertheless, soaked in conspiracy and oozing with interest and a thing for the internet. His brief tenure in the White House has been scrutinised and dissected like no other, nevertheless, the legacy of this once idolised figure remains largely intact. That legacy and its elaborate construction stems from a number of sources; Pablo Larrain's film focuses its attention on one in particular, Jackie Kennedy. The film follows the beloved first lady through the week following her husband's murder, chronicling her attempt to build a legacy not only for him, but for herself as well.The biopic (a contentious term when describing the film) uses a well-tested framing device, with an interview between a reporter and Mrs Kennedy serving as the springboard into recounting the events of the past week. The film does falter slightly here, trying too hard to create conflict between the two characters, which appears to be wholly unnecessary. It does however, provide Natalie Portman with the opportunity to add more complexity to her character, playing two roles: the grieving wife and the political spin-doctor.The flashbacks are told in a non-linear fashion, cutting between events throughout her time in the White House. The choppy and shattered nature of the film helps to capture Jackie Kennedy's psyche; the murder of her husband is juxtaposed with a re-staging of a 1962 White House documentary as this broken woman tries to piece together her legacy whilst in a deep state of mourning. The unique presentation of the film will be what divides cinema-goers, it's lack of cohesion means that at points it becomes episodic in nature and prevents it from offering a broad enough character study. However, for those of us worn-out by conventional biopics, Jackie should be absorbed and lauded as a diamond in the rough.The film's study of grief is captured with unflattering close-ups of Natalie Portman, shot in grainy 16mm and presented in a tight 1.66 : 1 aspect ratio. Cinematographer Stéphane Fontaine aptly captures the period and the bleakness of the situation. In the interview scenes, the Kennedy home carries a certain clinical quality, shots are overexposed and the home lacks character, mirroring the facade Jackie attempts to create. The stunning work of Fontaine is complimented by an ever- more stunning score by Meca Levi which seeps into your skin and haunts you, creating a surreal atmosphere that perfectly complements the chaotic nature of the film.Natalie Portman is astonishing in the lead role, worthy of the many accolades currently being thrown her way. The wispy and delicate voice is just one of the many components of this exquisite portrayal. Portman and Larrain synthesise the suffering, fear and conviction of Jackie Kennedy with single close-ups, capturing everything in such minute detail. The film rests solely on her performance and she delivers in abundance. 'Not another Camelot' she utters, words that, regardless of their meaning or intention, haunt this ghost story and its audience.The subject-matter may appear alienating for some, especially younger audiences unfamiliar with the first lady and her work. However, this isn't a character study in as much as an exploration of grief. This theme has the ability to resonate with anyone and everyone. It's an intensely intimate look at death, the heartbreak it causes and the lives it shatters.'Jackie' is a remarkably interesting film; its broken structure gives it a dreamlike quality drawing you into a world so entwined with myth and conspiracy and holding onto you like a vice. Levi's score will stick with you and Fontaine's beautiful work will captivate you, but its Portman's spectacular portrayal that will haunt you, much like the story itself.",8,4,7,6 March 2017
The Usual Suspects," Admit It: You Never Saw That Coming!!
","This is one of the most original cinematic stories ever told. 'The Usual Suspects' won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor, due to a fantastic cast and an awesome story with an even bigger plot twist.The Plot: Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), a Customs agent, brings Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), a small-time con artist with a limp, into a local Californian police station for questioning in hopes of discovering the identity of the mysterious criminal Kaiser Söze. Kint tells the story of how he, three other criminals, and formerly corrupt police officer Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) agreed to do a job for Söze who had vendettas against all of them. Kint explains that the job went wrong, and a man killed the others, including Keaton, before setting the ship they were all on board aflame. Kujan doesn't believe his story and instead forces him to admit that Keaton was really Kaiser Söze.The Twist: 'Who is Keyser Soze?' This is what everybody wants to know, as the viewer sees a crippled man named 'Verbal' Kint (who was part of a major crime alongside his partners) to the detectives assigned to the case.Crime lord Keyzer Soze is 'Verbal' Kint, who has just told detective Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) a pack of lies he's made up. As he's being released from custody, he steps out to the street and reveals himself as non-crippled. One of the greatest cinematic stories ever told and the greatest ending twist in film history. In what is arguably the greatest cinematic twist of all time, Kujan realises that everything Verbal told him during the interview can be found in pictures, clippings, and items around the office, revealing that Kint lied about everything. As Kint walks to his car, long gone from the police station, he drops his limp.The film ends with Kint reciting a quote by French poet Baudelaire: 'The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.' —Before the screen goes black, he adds, 'And like that he's gone.'This is the kind of twist that makes repeat viewings so rewarding. Once you know what's up, you can start to differentiate between the lies and the truths.Admit it: You never saw that coming!!",9,1,1,8 December 2016
Avengers: Endgame," An Epic semi-Ending to an Epic Franchise
","If there's also any single phrase that sums up the guiding principle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe it's this: Hold that thought. (Truth be told, with Endgame's running time of three hours, 'hold that bladder' would also apply.)But the bottom line is that it's as hilarious as mush as it is Heartbreaking.It's helpful, before going to see Endgame, to cast your mind back to the contradictory feelings of that final scene. This one focuses on the efforts of Cap and the remaining Avengers to implement a do-over - essentially rewinding the effects of Thanos' snap - feels at once sad and deeply satisfying, complicated and surprisingly comic. If many of us have grown up with the MCU, the films themselves have also grown more complex, like a fine wine.In a sense, Endgame is an example of the MCU cannibalizing itself, but it has always done so. And it does so here in a fresh way that is closer to homage than lazy appropriation. These affectionate flashbacks also serve as a tip of the hat to all the loyal fans who have held this sprawling mythology so dear.Spoiler Alert? Sure! THOR IS FAT!!!As high as the stakes are in Endgame, it is also a very funny movie. The humor of the story - some of which takes place in the future, five years after the end of 'Infinity War' - has to do with surprising ways in which the lives of certain characters have changed (along with their personalities and, in some cases, their physiques). If Infinity War was about failure, Endgame is, ironically, all about acceptance and moving on. After 11 long years, the Infinity Saga is finally, fulfillingly over.There is no post-credit scene. But oh, what a going-away party these old friends have thrown for themselves. You'd certainly be in more tears then you were during Infinity war's climax. Tears of joy for most, that is.",10,3,12,24 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," 'You're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.' - Tony Stark
","Warning: Major spoilers for Avengers: Infinity War below.When Avengers: Infinity War opened on April 27th, it exceeded even Disney's own lofty expectations, besting Star Wars: The Force Awakens for the biggest box office opening in history. Given that it's the film meant to bring together all previous 18 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Infinity War certainly had plenty of audience hype working in its favor. But it also had a secret weapon to help inspire interest: death.For years now, fans and critics have vocally assumed that when the movie's big bad, Thanos (Josh Brolin) finally came to battle The Avengers face to face, at least one beloved character would end up dead. Some felt it would almost certainly be Captain America (Chris Evans); the constant back-and-forth of contract negotiations made Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark another likely possibility. But as audiences discovered at the end of Infinity War, it wasn't just one character who died. It was half of the team, with Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Spider-Man (Tom Holland), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) just a few of the headliner characters who crumbled to dust when Thanos snapped his Infinity Gauntlet-clad fingers. And that doesn't even count Loki (Tom Hiddleston - who dies meanlessly), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Heimdall (Idris Elba), and Vision (Paul Bettany), all of whom bit the dust well before the movie's climactic moment.Thanos slaughtering half the universe, and half the characters built up as stars over the course of the past 10 years, was arresting, shocking, and utterly heartbreaking. It was a stunning ending. There was just one problem: it was totally meaningless.In the moment, the emotional impact of seeing all of those characters vanish is undeniably powerful. This is a franchise where no topline hero has truly died or even abandoned the series. I've seen the film twice, and both times, the audience in my theater has had the same gasping, horrified visceral reaction. It's a cinematic moment, unlike anything we've seen in modern blockbuster filmmaking. But the best way to gauge viewers' reactions to the ending is watching how they respond to the credits, and what comes after. Marvel fans have gotten used to two extra moments at the end of the studio's films: a mid-credits scene and a post-credits teaser, Infinity War drops the mid-credits scene, and subs in a title card, which crumbles to dust in the same way the fallen Avengers did. Both times I've seen the film, the audience has groaned audibly at that title card, as if they were hoping for some light-hearted moment of reprieve to make everything a little better. (The lone post-credits scene does tease Captain Marvel as a possible savior, but it's hard to get too excited after watching Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury disintegrate.)But the reason savvy movie audiences know to stay for post-credits sequences in the first place is the exact same reason the ending of Infinity War feels so cheap upon further reflection. This is an interconnected cinematic universe, with one movie setting up the next in an escalating series of introductions, team-ups, setbacks, and triumphs. No MCU film operates in isolation. And most fans of the series have an intrinsic awareness at this point that Infinity War sets up both Ant-Man and The Wasp (coming July 2018) and Captain Marvel (set for March 2019), which will inevitably set up the still-untitled Avengers sequel, and so on and so forth.If Marvel had killed off Captain America or Iron Man, audiences might have believed there would be no walkbacks or resurrections. Their characters have been milked by the MCU in numerous films over a decade, and it would not be hard at all to accept that their time had finally come. Instead, Thanos' grand act of destruction wipes out the characters that represent the future of the franchise. It targets the characters that Marvel's corporate parent, Disney, would simply never let go - especially since some of them already have sequels lined up.So once audiences step outside the theater and begin thinking about Avengers: Infinity War, what initially felt like a devastating loss begins to feel like the cheapest of stunts. People are just far too aware of the way entertainment is produced, promoted, and consumed to not recognize that none of these horrible deaths are actually going to stick. And to be fair, there is a positive element to that. Beloved characters dying is a downer, and an audience that truly believes their newest favorite character may be gone for good is an audience that could be disincentivized to check out the next Avengers installment when it rolls around. Instead, millions of Black Panther and Spider-Man fans - all of whom know T'Challa and Peter Parker will be back - will head into next year's Avengers movie eager to find out how their favorite characters will survive Thanos' wrath. The plot also sets up a potentially powerful torch-passing moment. The old-school Avengers survived Infinity War, but what if they eventually sacrifice themselves for real, in order to let the new generation of MCU heroes carry on the bigger fight?But even that calculation on Marvel's part betrays a certain amount of audience meta-awareness, a level of strategic thinking about the way corporations and studios position their intellectual properties to maximize their value across movies, TV shows, books, games, theme parks, and every other vertical possible. It's recognizing movies as pure business, rather than pure storytelling. And that may be the saddest lesson of Infinity War.I recall seeing The Empire Strikes Back when I was young. At the time, there were just two Star Wars movies. Darth Vader being Luke's father caused all kinds of good-guy vs. bad-guy cognitive dissonance, even for a child. Seeing Han Solo stuck in a block of carbonite and shipped off to a gangster was emotionally devastating, but it seemed all too possible that his story was over. There was no ongoing production pipeline to feed or larger ecosystem that required these characters to exist in perpetuity. The movie's cliffhanger ending set up a sequel, but there were no guarantees about how any of the storylines would actually turn out.It was a simpler time, and not just because we were younger. It was simpler because individual movies were still their own primary driving force. For audiences, there was no certainty about what could or couldn't happen when a storyline decided to get dark. For the simple experience of cinematic storytelling, it was a purer experience. In the days since I first saw Infinity War, I've wondered how its ending would have played in that environment. I would have been outraged, to be sure - but that outrage would have led to an even more potent catharsis when some of these 'dead' characters inevitably return to the land of the living.Instead, we got a facsimile of loss, a moment where audiences go through the motions, aghast that a movie had the guts to kill off a leading character, without having to deal with any messy emotional ramifications. In a way, it does seem like the most Marvel approach possible. These are comic book movies, where nobody can really die - even after we see them turn to ash.",9,1,4,17 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," An incredibly shocking history told in an incredible alternate way (DiCaprio and Pitt 10/10)
","I don't know why critics are being so harsh on the ending. For me, and for most people/fans I feel, it was awesome! Tarantino's always been a collage artist, a man cobbling together new stories from shards of the odd bit of cult culture here and there, and Hollywood sees him fully embracing that mode.This approach lets Tarantino cut loose, which is probably to the film's benefit, especially as we center on DiCaprio and Pitt as his leads. It's a bizarre thing to see former teen heartthrobs like these two suffer and flail about their closing careers, or to hear so many people call Pitt's character 'old.' (As one shirtless scene shows us, even old Pitt can still get it.) Of the two, Dalton has a harder time with it, his ego comically wrapped around the idea of his career fading. In one of his latest guest stints as a heavy on a Western, he connects briefly with his precocious eight-year-old co-star (an unstoppable Julia Butters) who reinvigorates his confidence as an actor, especially after an explosive breakdown in his trailer.DiCaprio is having particularly garish fun here, ripping into his signature Jordan Belfort-era intensity and turning his washed-up TV star into a petulant, gurning child, as you do when you're forced to contemplate cranking out spaghetti Westerns in Rome to keep your career afloat. On the other end of the spectrum is Pitt, all Southern drawl and stoicism, the kind of unstoppable Billy Jack figure who can fight to a draw with Bruce Lee (Mike Moh) and even hold his own in some tense confrontations with the Manson family. The two are gangbusters together, evincing even in their quiet moments the camaraderie of two men who've spent their lives together, Cliff being 'more than a best friend and a little less than a wife' to Rick. They shine even when they split apart for their separate stories - Rick's guest spot on Lancer and Cliff's unexpected detour to the Manson Ranch - but each feels of a piece with the other.As for the Mansons themselves, they play a much more peripheral part in Hollywood than one might expect from a gore-lover like Tarantino. Instead, they're another layer to the gonzo tapestry he's woven, a group of young nutcases who've taken over Spahn Ranch (where the fictional Bounty Law was shot) and who give the older Cliff no amount of discomfort. They're a group of kids resentful of the largesse of Hollywood, who want to 'kill the people who taught us to kill' through violent TV shows and movies; as one of cinema's foremost purveyors of bloodshed, it's a bold move for Tarantino to take.And yet, that self-reflexivity beats at the heart of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, a film made by a man who sees his own obsolescence coming. Just as Cliff and Rick barrel inexorably toward the 'end of the trail' for their partnership and the era of Hollywood that would take them in, so too does Tarantino see the same for himself. It's tempting to read it as an 'old man yells at cloud' feature, with its characters' many resentments toward young bucks taking their jobs. But it's just as easy to imagine Tarantino owning up to the limitations of your age and range, instead tipping his hat and riding off into the sunset. He's got one more film in him, but even if this were Tarantino's swan song, it wouldn't be a bad note to go out on.",10,141,250,28 July 2019
Mr. Nobody," 'As long as you do not choose, everything remains possible. '
","Mr. Nobody is a movie ' sci-fi' which I think is not intended to be a sci-fi movie. Well , the film is directed by Jaco van Dormael , a Belgian director who is actually (just like Richard Kelly, director Donnie Darko), in my opinion, can always release a ' one-hit wonder'. In addition, the film is also filled by a unique cast-full of variations and as if random; starting from the 30 Seconds to Mars vocalist Jared Leto, who desperately deserve the main role as Nemo Nobody, and Diane Kruger as Anna, her true love Nemo,. Judging from the cast- it is somewhat random, but apparently there is a purpose behind it all. Nemo narrates a voyage through several permutations of his life, following alternate paths. He chooses to grow up with each of his divorcing parents (Natasha Little and Rhys Ifans); has three separate and mutually canceling lifelong romances (Juno Temple grows into Diane Kruger; Clare Stone becomes Sarah Polley; Audrey Giacomini becomes Linh Dam Pham); and experiences various brushes with death. As if the Cloud Atlas-level juggling act weren't enough, Belgian writer-director Jaco Van Dormael throws in a hypnosis conceit and, courtesy of Nemo's sometime work as a writer, fiction within the fiction. In one iteration, Nemo appears as a TV scientist who lectures on string theory and entropy. The character's name alludes to both Jules Verne and The Odyssey, but Mr. Nobody's expansive literary ambitions turn out to have a powerful ordering principle: sentimentality.Well, in outline, Mr. Nobody actually tells about probability and parallel timeline . Wait! The outline was withdrawn by ignoring the final conclusion of the film. The plot in this movie actually does not start at the beginning of the movie, but after entering the teenage. It is said that Nemo Nobody's life was filled with choices, even since he was still not born. Because of ' Butterfly Effect' , Nemo was finally born in all choices and probabilities. Nemo himself said, ' It's hard to choose, ' but eventually he came to his own conclusion, 'As long as you do not choose, everything remains possible. 'It's a 'must see' film for every film lover. Especially the smart ones.",9,1,1,28 March 2018
Get Out," Just because you're invited, doesn't mean you're welcome.
","'Get Out' takes the initial premise of 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' and then twists it with 'The Stepford Wives' to create a compelling, thoughtful critique of white power. Peele, of course, isn't arguing that white people are out to hypnotise black people. Instead, Get Out is a stinging criticism of the white liberalism that carries itself as empathetic towards blacks, but that empathy only extends as far as white control. Peele isn't taking aim at Neo- Nazis and other whites who would angrily shout the n-word. They're a lost cause. Instead, he's looking at those who profess their lack of racism, but only do so if they can maintain their dominance over black people in the most insidious manner possible. As Chris pointedly notes to Rose at party full of white people, 'Has anyone here ever met a black person that didn't work for them?'The film is genuinely creepy. Instead of cheesy music and grotesque torture porn, Peele relies on the unknown to draw you in. What is happening here? The plot builds like a slow boil to a terror explosion. Clues to the outcome are evident from the first second, but it takes the entire run-time to pull everything together. It's such a joy to be surprised by a horror outcome. I don't think I've seen a genre film this inventive since Cabin in the Woods. The resolve is truly satisfying.My favourite aspect of Get Out is the intelligence of the characters. There's a lot to like, but beyond the deeper themes; the characters aren't morons. I cringe every time I watch a genre film and the characters don't behave logically. Chris and Rose are not fools. Something is amiss, enough to warrant wariness. Anyone in this situation would be unnerved as events play out. Credit again to Peele for writing characters that act rationally.'Get Out' doesn't replace the scares with humour – Peele is too smart to do that. Instead, he balances the fear with laughs and then laces everything with social comment and that unsettling tone. The fact that Chris is so eminently likable just underlines it. It all adds up to something of a treat – for everybody, not just horror fans.",8,616,938,17 March 2017
A Quiet Place," One of the most thrilling films of the 21st century!
","It's not just the grace before meals. Mom and Dad - per the end credits, Evelyn and Lee Abbott, played by real-life husband and wife Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, who also directs - have an easy emotional intimacy and awareness of one another that would be moving and enviable in any screen couple. Their slow dance to Neil Young's Harvest Moon - sharing earbuds because the blind monsters track their prey by sound, so any significant noise is potentially deadly - is the most tender screen dance in ages.Centrally, A Quiet Place offers an empathic portrayal of disability, namely deafness - the one disability that would seem most dangerous given the premise, but which turns out to hold a key to survival.This is by far one of the most thrilling films of the 21st century. Make no mistakes, be sure to see it.",8,2,3,17 April 2018
Call Me by Your Name," A 'Must See' coming-of-age tale!
","It isn't taboo-busting which makes Call Me By Your Name a deserving must see; it deserves a 'look' because, as great cinema should, it beautifully conveys the universality of a specific human story.It's a coming-of-age film, but one that achieves an unusual emotional immediacy. In northern Italy in 1983, 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) begins a relationship with visiting Oliver (Armie Hammer), his father's research assistant, with whom he bonds over his emerging sexuality, their Jewish heritage, and the beguiling Italian landscape. Depictions of same-sex relationships have been deemed Oscar-worthy before (Philadelphia in 1993; Brokeback Mountain in 2005 and, of course, last year's Moonlight), but this film goes further by allowing Elio and Oliver to escape the usually devastating consequences that cinema dishes out to its gay protagonists. Not only is Elio not struck down by a life-limiting illness, persecuted by unjust laws or turned out on the streets, he enjoys the support of a loving, emotionally intuitive family. Michael Stuhlbarg may have missed out on an Oscar nomination for the role of Elio's father, but the speech he gives on heartbreak will surely save audiences years of therapy by enacting the ideal parent figure we all wish we'd had.'Call Me By Your Name' celebrates the mystery and power of sexuality, and all its attendant danger, exaltation and tenderness. And most importantly it oozes nostalgic melancholy and avoids the cliches in many films about gay love.",9,0,3,22 February 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," If this franchise is to continue, it needs a readjustment from the standard we've been given...
","As far as swashbuckling adventures on the high seas go, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales – what a mouthful – is running on stagnant tides. It's amazing to think a film series based off of an amusement park ride would get to its fifth entry in the first place, a much wilder notion being that that fifth time out of the gate may actually offer up something new and inventive. That isn't to be the case, though, and this latest outing featuring the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow, still played by Johnny Depp and all of his crazy mannerisms, offers nothing special beyond the typical excitement to which we've been privy many times before. Dead Men Tell No Tales attempts to re-energise the Pirates franchise with fresh blood and a younger cast, but, without any creativity to back it up, it all ends up treading the same blockbuster waters.It doesn't help that Depp, still channelling rock stars of old, appears bored underneath the captain's hat and pirate flair that make up the character's grungy exterior. His eyes bulge and dart around as previously seen, and he delivers on the same mannerisms that made the character so memorable in the first place (and also garnered Depp an Academy Award nomination back in 2004). There isn't enough new about the character this time around, though, and, save for a brief flashback that depicts how Captain Jack Sparrow initially made his name, it's a completely forgettable performance this time around.I don't blame Depp for wearing out his welcome as Capt. Jack - would you turn down tens of millions up front, and even more on the back end, and probably a lifetime supply of do-rags, to return to the series? He doesn't write this stuff, which is almost exactly the same old stuff we've seen four times before. I didn't actively dislike the movie, but I rarely laughed at the jokes or felt the tingle of excitement during the action sequences. It felt more than ever like a rote exercise in Disney accounting, and the adding machine will continue to whirr and click and spit out receipts - the studio has already green-lit a sixth film. I'll see you right back here in a year or three.But if this franchise is to continue, it needs a readjustment from the standard we've been given, especially when it comes to Depp's character and performance. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales isn't a complete wash for the franchise, but it's a definite indicator this series needs to take a new, more exciting course if it is to carry on much longer.",6,3,12,30 May 2017
Hidden Figures," Just be prepared to eat someone else's dust...
","Hidden Figures is the kind of film that will endure nonetheless. It has a charismatic ensemble cast and a story that comes across so right in a time when everything seems so wrong.It celebrates the unsung, or at least largely unknown outside of their field; it calls out prejudice and denounces the marginalising of communities and genders; it makes mind-numbing mathematics appear accessible (proof, if you still needed it, of how movies are a grand illusion); and it appeals to those who are always looking to the stars – if not to dream about getting there, then at least to wonder about our place among them.The three central figures here, all winningly portrayed, are also trying to find their place in life while constantly being told what and where that place should be.They work in a colour-segregated building (this is the American South, after all, at a time when the Civil Rights Movement is only just gathering steam) as human 'computers', assigned to perform complex calculations on flight and space data by hand. Even washrooms are segregated, a point the movie stresses several times to (unfortunately) near-caricature levels which, to me, tended to diminish the impact of that particular aspect.Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) is a capable administrator long denied a supervisory role; Katherine Goble (Taraji P. Henson) is a mathematics prodigy who gets a big break when she is assigned as a computer to the all-white Space Task Group, only to face indifference – at best – from her colleagues; and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) dreams of becoming an engineer in a state where engineers are (a) male and (b) white, and the only option for her is to be allowed to attend classes at a whites- only school.The film collapses their respective struggles – which took place years apart – into one heady period in 1961 when the United States and Soviet Union were involved in a desperate space race, and the US was lagging behind.Now that sort of conflating is OK for the purposes of telling a dramatic story on screen, one that does not have the luxury of being read slowly over time like a book or historical record.While the three women and their families as depicted are real characters, most of the white folks (save for the astronauts) are not. Kevin Costner's Nasa boss Al Harrison is a composite figure, as are Jim Parsons' uptight statistician/theorist Paul Stafford and Kirsten Dunst's strict and aloof administrative supervisor Vivian Mitchell.Stafford and Mitchell are meant to reflect certain attitudes prevalent among white men and women in those times but this sort of conflating, on the other hand, renders them intentionally unsympathetic characters who might as well be cardboard standees with embedded voice chips.The same almost goes for Costner's Harrison, who comes perilously close to achieving escape velocity into the wild blue yonder of 'white saviour'. 'That's a very nice rocket, honey. Now you get to sleep so Mommy can run off to her night job of running a hip-hop empire.' - Moments of genuinely felt triumph, quiet suffering, and ebullient celebration (Mahershala Ali's proposal scene is surprisingly affecting in spite of its supreme corniness) will hold your attention between the absolutely riveting test flight scenes that culminate in John Glenn's (Glen Powell) attempt to become the first American to orbit the Earth.And although it is set over half a century ago in a distant part of the world, the film's core lessons still resonate and apply to any place and any situation today.If you've got a problem, and you choose to let prejudice, ego or other types of personal maladjustment blind you to parties that can contribute towards a solution... Well Just be prepared to eat someone else's dust...",8,2,8,26 February 2017
Mulholland Drive," Beware what you dream for... Silencio...
","David Lynch (One of my personal favourite directors) is a true indie film maker. He makes his movies his way and never seems too concerned with whether or not they're accessible or will find an audience. But every few years, one breaks through and goes beyond his own cult audience, hitting hard with mainstream success. Movies like Blue Velvet (1986 movie) and Lost Highway (1997 movie) will pop up, and remind regular movies goers that the dude who made Twin Peaks (TV series) is still around. The last movie of his that I remember breaking through big, was Mulholland Drive the 2001 movie.Lynch's themes are wild and unconventional: dreams materialised; crazy thought bubbles brought to life. Whereas Orson Welles' great film begins with a brief moment of surrealism – involving a snow globe and the cryptic word 'Rosebud' – but then proceeds in a more straight-forward manner, Lynch maintains the surreal atmosphere throughout. In this sense Mulholland Drive picks up where Citizen Kane left off. Its dream-like qualities give rise to many confusing and unexplained things that naturally encourage interpretation. But as critic Roger Ebert, one of the film's greatest champions noted: 'There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.'The best explanation is a long one which would suggest the old couple are judges of the jitterbug contest that Betty won and then at the end, signs of her innocent past come back to terrorise her. It answers some of the smaller puzzles, too, such as: who is Jennifer Syme, the woman the film is dedicated to? (An actress who appeared in Lost Highway, who died in a car accident.) The movie is hypnotic; we're drawn along as if one thing leads to another but nothing leads anywhere, and that's even before the characters start to fracture and recombine like flesh caught in a kaleidoscope. Mulholland Drive isn't like Memento, where if you watch closely enough you can hope to explain the mystery. There is no explanation. There may not even be a mystery.Perhaps it is no coincidence that David Lynch's mind-bending mystery-drama Mulholland Drive has been named by BBC Culture's critics' poll as the best film of the century so far. Its very roots lie in television: the film began as a failed TV pilot and was salvaged into feature-length format. If you've seen David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, chances are you've been arguing about it ever since. How is Diane, the failed actor, related to Betty, the fresh-faced wannabe? Was the end really the beginning? What was the significance of the creepy nightclub Silencio, and what was in that mysterious blue box? Who were the laughing elderly couple, and what did the cowboy have to do with anything? Is there a deeper meaning – or is it a mistake to try too hard to decipher anything that David Lynch does?'Mulholland Drive,' is such a film which even its most ardent fans admit is as maddeningly baffling as it is mesmerising, despite being named the greatest film of the 21st century by BBC, just to let you guys know: that it took me 4 months to figure out the plot.Sorry for the spoiler. It's also a reason why it's one of the 'Weirdest films of all time!'Silencio...",10,10,15,2 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Not a Star Wars movie . . .
","It's been quite a while since the release of the latest film in the Star Wars universe, so I'm figuring it's safe to release a review that has spoilers in it. But if you have not seen the movie, turn back! I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. So read no further if you don't want to be spoiled.The Last Jedi seems to have been the most divisive movie of 2017. It seems to have been a love it or hate it movie, and thankfully I'm in the group that thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel like people have put Star Wars way too high on a pedestal to the point where no matter how good the movie is, there's always going to be someone who hates on it because it's got the name Star Wars in front of it. What's not to love about Luke Skywalker creating a hologram of himself and sending it to the rebels aid thousands of miles away, Kylo Ren killing the Snoke or Rey beginning to master her Jedi powers?I get it, the tone of the movie was different than A New Hope and the Empire Strikes back, but if someone makes the argument that The Last Jedi is too 'kiddie' or 'goofy' I don't understand... (Have these people not seen Return of the Jedi? There's too many flatulence and belching jokes to count plus Ewoks are basically teddy bears. That's not even including Jar Jar Binks or any of the other weird stuff from the prequels).Nevertheless, this movie is not without it's faults. Princess Leia suddenly being able to not only use the force to Superman herself back into the ship, but also being able to survive in space at all was strange to say the least. Plus the side adventure with Rose and Finn ended up being meaningless and felt like unnecessary filler in this already much longer than normal movie run time.Overall, I like the movie a lot as a movie but not as a Star Wars movie. They kept the main theme of each movie being a war movie intact (the plot of the rebel ship being chased by the empire of course being a play on a naval battle). Mark Hamill was spectacular and he stole the show every time he was on screen. And the chemistry between Kylo and Rey was excellent. If you haven't given this movie a second watch I highly recommend it because it kinda gets better the second time around.",5,5,9,25 April 2018
Cold War," A beautifully composed poem of doomed love in Cold War Europe
","Less is most definitely more in Cold War. Using the same academy ratio and frosty black and white from the Oscar-winning Ida, the Polish auteur's new film tells the tale of a tragic romance between a musician and a singer, spanning fifteen years and the fractured continent of post-war Europe. We first see Wictor (Tomasz Kot) in the depths of a Polish winter in 1949, as he and fellow musicologist Irena (Agata Kulesza) putter around the frozen landscape in a truck, recording folk music wherever they find it.Along with administrative bureaucrat Kaczmarek (Borys Szyc), a school is set up to harvest young talent and create an ensemble to celebrate Polish musical culture and tradition. Competition is fierce but one candidate catches Wictor's eye, a young blonde student called Zula (Joanna Kulig). She's ambitious and sly and it's rumoured she killed her father: 'He mistook me for my mother and I used a knife to show him the difference'. Wictor falls hard and, despite the dangers inherent in the situation and the fact that Zula might even be informing on him, a love affair begins.As concerts are given and the school proves its value, so the state intervenes and folk music gives way to propaganda, with songs about the joys of agricultural reform and the wonder of Stalin. The group also tours abroad to export a vision of peasant authenticity and associated Soviet values. At this point, Wictor decides he's had enough and plans to use a trip to Berlin to cross with Zula to freedom and the West. Zula, however, uncertain and afraid, misses her chance and Wictor crosses alone.So their love affair becomes as fractured as Europe, but crucially their serial separations are caused as much by their own decisions as by any external political forces. Zula's lack of courage is one such moment, but she also tells Wictor: 'I would never have crossed without you'. Pawlikowski has structured his film in a series of economic scenes, separated by fade-to-black lacunas where years pass, unseen and mute, and opportunities are irredeemably lost. Lukasz Zal's simply sublime cinematography now replaces the snowy tones of Poland for the cigarette-smoke greys, nightclub dark and sharp neon whites of Paris. The music also evolves from folk to propaganda and then to jazz and a quick burst of drunken rock n' roll. Later, it will find an atrocious denouement in the kind of 'Boom-Boody-Boom' Eurotrash, giving the sense that the world has moved an insuperable distance from Wictor and Zula's beginnings.Wictor and Zula are both played with aplomb by Kot and Kulig, neither falling into the stereotypes that others would have them be. Despite his garret flat, he's not the tortured artist and, for all the damage done, she's no simple femme fatale. They are flawed and wilful - liable to jealousy and a free hand with the booze - but their mistakes are punished disproportionately and therefore unjustly. The borders might separate them, but they also imbue their love with a stoic tragic heroism. Pawlikowski's Cold War is dedicated to his parents, on whose love affair it is loosely based. It is an appropriately beautiful and sympathetic tribute. This is the refined work of an artist at the peak of his powers. A true masterpiece.",9,144,185,25 June 2018
Logan," If this is a Western, Logan is very reminiscent of broken-down antiheroes!
","Like Clint Eastwood's William Munny in Unforgiven-a trained killer nursing decades of regret and sorrow, with enough juice for one last mission. The dirty little secret few critics dare mention is that James Mangold's last film, The Wolverine, was just as good as Logan, if not better. Mangold proudly wears his influences on his sleeve; a pivotal scene sees Xavier and Laura watching a clip from George Stevens's seminal 1953 film Shane, about another grim gunfighter with a mysterious past. Logan prefers hand-to-hand combat, of course, but aside from that he's quite similar to Alan Ladd's character in that film, a trained killer who fought for the good guys but didn't consider himself one of them.Mangold is an excellent director with a solid, unheralded resume (including the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line and the Sylvester Stallone neo-noir Cop Land). But Jackman and Stewart are, quite simply, why Logan works-they're why the film doesn't just feel like a cheap exercise in bloody violence, and why its subversion of typical superhero-movie tropes feels organic (unlike with the X-Men spinoff Deadpool). The actors bring warmth and grouchy humor to the story, barking at each other like the married couple they've become, as they go on a road trip north with their young ward in tow.The story itself is a little all over the place-Logan and company ping-pong from location to location across the country, as the villainous Donald Pierce (Boyd Holbrook), a metal-armed bounty hunter, chases them in search of Laura. A long digression at the house of a friendly family of civilians feels a little forced; the film's bloody climax, involving a sniveling scientist (played to the hilt by Richard E. Grant) and another mysterious enemy, slightly overstays its welcome. No matter-anytime things get too out of hand, Jackman and Stewart are there to tether them back to earth, and at no point does a cosmic portal appear in the sky, or a giant purple supervillain start a monologue about magical gems.'Logan' is Jackman's latest, and possibly last, portrayal of Wolverine, the Marvel superhero he has played since 2000. If this is his final run at the role (comic-book characters do have a way of making surprise comebacks, so I'm wary), it's a peculiar milestone worth noting-he's our first superhero actor to officially age out of a role, a testament to the extreme longevity of some of these franchises. Will we get another Logan one day? Quite likely, no matter how foolish a proposition that might be; this is a world with a new Han Solo and a new John McClane, after all. All the more reason to salute Jackman as he rides out into the sunset; that's Logan's chief task, and it succeeds splendidly.",8,5,9,31 January 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," From Evolution to Exploration to Artificial Intelligence to Extraterrestrial Life to other Dimensions of Reincarnation. . .
",". . . this is NO such film that shies away from Allegorical Philosophies.The year was 1968.America was in the midst of The Space Race with the Russians. Man had yet to set foot on the moon, but the Apollo program was in full swing. The world was only a year away from taking One small step for man.There was probably never more attention and fervour surrounding space exploration than during that specific period in time. And that year, Stanley Kubrick released 2001: A Space Odyssey.One of the most ambitious films of all time.2001: A Space Odyssey begins with The Dawn of Man.In a fifteen minute segment to lead the movie, Kubrick shows a tribe of apes before and after they're visited by an obsidian obelisk.Prior to seeing the obelisk, the apes are shown living amongst the pigs, picking fleas, attacked by a leopard, and having a territorial shouting match with another pack of apes over their water hole.They're animals.The film famously features extensive dialogue free segments with filled with classical music. In fact, whenever music is used, there is no dialogue, and anytime there's dialogue, there is no music. As opposed to most films, which feature original scores, 2001 features famous classical pieces, legendarily opening with Richard Strauss Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and here as were brought into space, Johann Strauss IIs waltz, On the Beautiful Blue Danube.Were taken to an orbiting space station, and follow a man on-board. He briefly contacts his daughter via videophone, and then sits briefly with some contemporaries. In stark contrast to the flea picking, bone wielding apes, these people are cordial and civilised. Polite. Sophisticated. A group of international doctors sharing a drink in a lounge area on a space station.The talk turns serious. The lunar substation Clavius has fallen out of contact. Those attempting to reach it are receiving error messages, and it recently denied a request for docking. There's suspicion of an epidemic outbreak.Having the computer in control of every aspect of the mission turn on you is a dangerous proposition. A fact that the passengers on-board learn the hard way. Yet the most frightening moments of HALs arc don't lie in the cold, calculated actions HAL takes against the humans on Discovery One, but in the plaintive begging he makes for his life when hes facing shutdown.Im afraid, and I can feel it HAL keeps repeating over and over. Very human emotions. Was HAL indeed alive?But 2001 isn't a movie about a conflict with an on-board computer. Nor does it end when HAL is taken offline. Instead it continues when Dave, the final crew member alive on Discovery One, encounters the obelisk.What proceeds is famously open for interpretation. An extensive barrage of flashing lights and visual effects comprise a sequence signifying time travel? Inter-dimensional travel? Evolution to a non-corporal being? Death? Kubrick refused to state explicitly. No dialogue accompanies this final segment of the movie. It unfolds like a work of art in motion.It culminates in the sudden arrival of the pod in an all white room, decorated with pieces of fine art, containing a bed and a dinner table. There, Dave sees himself. Aging, dying, evolving.Thus Spoke Zarathustra sounds again as an embryonic being of pure light looks out over the surface of the Earth from outer space.This is a movie that challenges its audience. It has incredible aspirations. It paints across an enormous canvas, poses the deepest of questions, and then gives no easy answers. It shows, it does not tell. It makes the viewer think and feel, without telling them what to think and feel. This movie is the antithesis of modern movies that cater to the lowest common denominator. It is unafraid of pushing the boundaries of the medium, and breaking away from convention. Even with effects works over 40 years old, the movie still has the power to astound the viewer with its beauty.Imaginative. Impressionistic. Evocative. Thought Provoking. Astonishing. Epic.As Kubrick said he didn't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point, just add 'quotation mark' on that 2001 and you'll get the point.",10,4,6,14 June 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," If you think the title makes the movie sound penetrable, you have no idea.
","Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004 movie) has earned a place in moviegoers' hearts, not to mention plenty of 'best movies of the 21st-century' lists. The mind-bending romantic tragedy with Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet is the perfect pairing of bizarre screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and whimsical French director Michel Gondry. If you think this makes the movie sound penetrable, you have no idea. As the movie opens, Joel is seized with an inexplicable compulsion to ditch work and take the train to Montauk, and on the train he meets Clementine. For all they know they have never seen each other before, but somehow there's a connection, a distant shadow of Deja Vu. During the course of the film, which moves freely, dazzlingly, forward and backward in time, they will each experience fragmentary versions of relationships they had, might have had, or might be having. This film in particular, is actually about a man named Joel (Jim Carrey) who is heartbroken to find out that his girlfriend (Kate Winslet) has gone through a procedure that deleted every memory of him from her mind, so he decides to do the same. In the process, he realises that he still loves her, and will do anything to keep his memories of her.The movie is a radical example of Maze Cinema, that style in which the story coils back upon itself, redefining everything and then throwing it up in the air and redefining it again.",9,1,1,27 June 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Happily, gone wrong it has NOT! (Well. . . Kinda')
","Imagine if Disney announced a new live action remake of Fantasia and decided to keep Mickey Mouse in it. Try to envision how the photo- realistic CGI might look. Not a hand-drawn Mickey swanning around with a bucket-carrying broomstick, but an actual mouse the size of a person wearing a sorcerer's costume and walking on its hind legs. Also a broomstick that has arms and hands and walks on its, er, hind straw.Would this hybrid human-rodent and its transmogrified cleaning tool look just as magical in live action as they did in the 1940 classic? You wouldn't bet your house on it; the mental image required to picture such a visualisation is weird and preposterous. If Big Mouse executives decided to give the project a go-ahead one question would linger at the core of it: why bother?And so now, you think this film will end up as Disney's revamped and bizarrely note-for-note 'Beauty and the Beast' just as American filmmaker Gus van Sant treated British Cinema, Sir Alfred Hitchcock and his sacred thriller 'Psycho' as if it were a blueprint for his much maligned shot-by-shot pathetic 1998 remake.Condon's movie may not have a giant rodent or personified straw broom, but there are comparable alternatives – from the titular bear/boar/buffalo-like creature to a range of magical household things, including singing and dancing furniture. There are times when it will certainly seem not conformable; but not in fact enough to make anybody come out of the cinema with a firm belief that talking teacups belong only in cartoons or acid trips. In fact, those who predicted this wouldn't hold a talking candle to the animated original are in for a bit of a pickle and will be pleasantly surprised. The tale may be as old as time, but it's retold with freshness, charm and flair.Happily, gone wrong it has not. (Well. . . Kinda')There are a few minor fumbles, but you're likely to walk away with a lightened step, a broad smile and at least one song-worm in your ear.The story remains rock solid: essentially a sweet two-hand-er (well, one hand, one paw) in which two bookworms fall in love, helped along by an assortment of sentient household items. Everything hangs upon the casting of those two roles, but Condon has picked his leads well. Dan Stevens appears in human form during a new prologue, in which his vain prince is coped-up, caked in David Bowie eye make-up and surrounded by simpering female admirers, before an enchantress appears and zaps him with a frankly unreasonable curse. From then on, he's in full Beast mode, with a sub-woofer voice and giant horns, resembling the cooler, better-dressed brother of the Faun from Pan's Labyrinth. The CGI used to purify furry Stevens is variable in quality, but as Beast storms around his dank keep's exquisitely designed turrets, the performance is consistently strong. As much as he bellows, the wounded soul beneath the bombast is always clear.As for Beauty, Emma Watson immediately charms in her big opening number, in which the heroine suffers a village-worth's of idiots sharing (what should be) their inner monologues through song. Watson faces one difficult sequence after another — memorable vocalised songs, tussles with talking wardrobes, emotional exchanges with a grouchy Heffalump — but finds just the right combination of innocence and grit. Plus, she doesn't sound like Fran Drescher, which is an immediate advantage. Emma Watson is as wonderful as she is, tough, lionhearted character, rich in self-confidence and sass, with an inspiring disdain for the many injustices of a cruel patriarchal world.Condon's set pieces are old school, picture book, rococo, on-the- studio-lot style edifices, appealing in a very decent and honestly a cartoon lover sort of way. Works for a lot of you, kids!",7,14,32,13 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," 'It's Still Groot.' Infant or not!
","The visually stunning follow-up to Guardians of the Galaxy, has the same spark of cosmic brilliance that shone when we were first introduced to everyone's favourite, dysfunctional group of space misfits.If there's one truism in comic-book movie-making, it's that giant superhero team-ups are almost always sure-fire hits. (And then there's, ahem, crap like Fantastic Fours). What's less true is that superhero team-up sequels will have the same good fortune. All the right ingredients can be there—good cast, same director, bomb-ass CGI—and for whatever reason, the movie just doesn't ascend as high as its predecessor. Such is the rare case with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.Like any good mix-tape, James Gunn serves up a steady vibe. But as long as we're talking mix-tapes, think back to the first mix-tape your crush gave you. You remember the songs, the sequence, even the smell of the air wherever you listened to it. Now, quick: What was on the second mix-tape they made you? You remember some of it, but chances are you're having a tougher time remember if the opening track was by Steely Dan or Stevie Nicks. Or, y'know, any non-1978 equivalent. But GOTG2 ain't one of those. You're most likely to remember at least some of it quite easily. (Hopefully).To say the least: If you like superhero flirting, bonding, and not- too-graphic dick jokes, it's a hoot. There might even be a tearjerker or two. But if you're hoping for something radically different from the first Guardians, you might be disappointed.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is, at its very core, a story about family. Where its predecessor brought together five hilarious a- holes and helped them realise that there's more to life than stealing, revenge and running from your past, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 works to test their ties to one another only to further strengthen their bond.There are certainly flaws in the story structure and an aggressive case of trying to please fans by just recycling what worked in the first film, but at its core, Vol. 2 gives us insight into the sins of our fathers and certainly packs an emotional punch when it counts. It's loud, it's colourful, it's funny, and it's endearing. If you were a fan of the first, you're sure to enjoy the second. However, if you're looking for the greatest movie in the MCU to date, it'd be wise to level those expectations. Don't kid yourself into absolute fanatical- ridiculousness.To declare Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a beautiful film would be an understatement. Since Marvel actually did a some really good work and for the first time, bringing the new instalment loaded with some memorable goodies of visuals and stunning cinematography. However, the incredible visuals alone aren't what make Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a worthy sequel. Building on the dynamics within the core group of characters we already know and love, introducing us to an array of new and interesting guests, plus still managing to make us all howl with laughter one minute and fight to hold back tears the next, it's clear that Gunn's 'Guardians' are far more than one-hit-wonders.",6,3,6,19 May 2017
The Shape of Water," A socio-political fairy tale epic.
","In many ways The Shape of Water is a classic Guillermo Del Toro film. All the director's hallmarks are present: it's a fable, it's set against a socio-political backdrop, and it's about a monster.That first point is worth bearing in mind. Del Toro's films are always larger than life, and while that can work against him (Pacific Rim was too silly for many), here the broad tone helps offset the edginess of the material. And things get pretty damn edgy.That's where Del Toro seems to be trying something new. He's always had a taste for cinematic violence, but his films stayed pretty chaste until 2015's Crimson Peak. That film seems to have whet (wet) his appetite for kink, and here he really runs (swims) with it.This is a romance between two different species, one of them a fish-man imprisoned in a government laboratory. Del Toro never sugar coats the fact that the creature (beautifully performed by Doug Jones), is bestial, as likely to bite your fingers off as he is to wordlessly woo the cleaning lady.Sally Hawkins plays the recipient of the mer-dude's affections, a mute woman who takes care of her neighbour, an artist portrayed by Richard Jenkins. They are fantastic, as is the rest of the cast, all reliable heavy hitters.Michael Shannon plays, as he often does, a bureaucrat whose buttoned-down exterior masks a complete maniac. Of all the story beats his is the broadest. No prizes for guessing who turns out to be the real monster here.The film starts out with a level of whimsy comparable to Amelie, before delving into darker waters. Racism and homophobia begin to loom, and while the parallels Del Toro is drawing will be too clunky for some, the film's huge heart and good intentions are always on display.",8,15,25,24 April 2018
The Disaster Artist," To the Academy for not giving Franco a Best Actor nod well, guys: 'You're Tearing Me APART!'
","The Disaster Artist is definitely worth seeing. It's actually worth seeing more than once (which is what I'm going to do because I loved it so much). I haven't had this much fun in a movie since EVER!James Franco is a spot-on Tommy Wiseau who plays the character Johnny in The Room and James is amazing when he recreates The Disaster Artist scenes from The Room. Because James Franco put in so much dedication to this role, he is a wonderful Tommy and a wonderful director for the movie in general. He even stayed in Tommy's character when he was directing the movie!That being said, I think in order to really enjoy this movie, you'll have had to see The Room first. Trust me, you will enjoy it!!! I saw it for the first time a year ago and I have probably watched it at least 50 times now. Yes, it is an awful movie! But that is WHY it's good. Tommy Wiseau is absolutely perfect in the movie because you just can't turn away. James Franco really captures his essence in The Disaster Artist. And, he is now nominated for Golden Globes due to how amazing the movie is.The Disaster Artist is mainly about the relationship between the two main actors in The Room: Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero. And because of this, it is so interesting. They are the weirdest pair of best friends you could imagine! Tommy is so much older than Greg (even though he won't reveal his age or where he was born haha). This is why they're weird best friends. This shows that any friendship can flourish regardless of pointless differences. If two people click, they click. It's as simple as that.His performance was pretty amazing in my opinion, though. James Franco picked him to be Greg because he is his brother, and that is apparent. Even so, the storyline makes up for this. The other actors aren't the greatest either, but the movie is mainly about Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero's relationship in real life. The scenes that James Franco recreates as Tommy Wiseau are absolutely perfect! He put sooo much into this movie. If you are a James fan and/or a Tommy fan, you will like this movie. I guarantee it! And as for the Academy not giving Franco a Best Actor nod well, guys: 'You're Tearing Me APART!'",8,1,5,5 February 2018
Enemy at the Gates," A must see for every fan of the genre.
","'Enemy of the Gates' - Rumoured to be the most expensive European film ever made, Jean-Jacques Annaud's bloated Second World War epic is an audacious but no leaden rehash of 'Saving Private Ryan', complete with a lot of flaws and historical inaccuracies surely but not as nearly as it's polyglot miscasting. A British-French-German co-production - Set in Russia but shot in Germany, this attempt to give the Battle of Stalingrad its proper due is commendable. But the director's decision to focus on a widely discredited Soviet anecdote is misguided and undermines the film's credibility from the start.With the Nazis set to achieve a major propaganda coup by overrunning the city that bears the name of their Russian enemy, Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives in Stalingrad to kick the demoralised army into shape. Intimidation only goes so far, though, so one apparatchik, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), suggests they find a hero to inspire the troops.That hero is Vassily Zaitsev (Jude Law), a peasant from the Urals who happens to be a crack shot marksman or a Sniper if you play a lot of X-Box, which is no surprise since we're looking at Russia, the largest size-wise country is filled with more of these Snipers than the ambition to actually kill. Danilov builds the unassuming Vassily into a legend, trumpeting his exploits to such an extent that the Germans send their best sniper, Major Koenig (Ed Harris), to take him down.What follows is a series of one-on-one confrontations between the two men at various locales in the bombed-out city, juxtaposed with an unlikely and insipid romance between Vassily and pretty Jewish soldier Tania (Rachel Weisz). The opening scenes of chaos are as accomplished as those in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winner, but unlike Saving Private Ryan, from then on Annaud is not all at sea or at war. In fact he ensembles a pretty decent directional approach and tension-full script along with solid performances from his British leads.While for a war film, it has no notable 'extreme level brutality' on display or gores of Saving Private Ryan or any modern day slasher films as one might expect but it is nevertheless a must see for every fan of the genre.",8,0,0,24 July 2017
A Beautiful Mind," 'Hey everybody, let's go see a Film about Mathmatics!'
","As Saturday night propositions go, the pitch for 'A Beautiful Mind' is about as enticing as playing Happy Families with Fred West.But put Russell Crowe in the cinematic equation and Ron Howard's latest portion of Academy-friendly fare becomes a good deal more appetising. Just as the brusque Antipodean's intensity and screen charisma blinded audiences to the flaws in 'Gladiator', so he delivers another astonishing performance that more than compensates for this film's weaker facets.A (highly) fictionalised biopic of real-life maths whizz John Forbes Nash Jr, it follows the socially stunted prodigy from his professional beginnings as a nervous freshman at Princeton, through Cold War spy machinations, and his struggle to hold together his marriage to fellow mathematician Alicia (Connelly).Crowe is totally convincing - from 19-year-old student to OAP - giving a truth to Akiva Goldsman's occasionally twee dialogue and bringing fear and excitement to the most off-putting of subjects. Facing off with such a formidable, scene-stealing star would terrify a lesser actor than Jennifer Connelly, but she matches Crowe scene for scene. With a glamour and grace reminiscent of a 40s film star, and unafraid to suffer some unflattering close-ups of her angst- contorted face, the Golden Globe-winner delivers a performance that should see her secure a place on the A-list.Another supporting player who signals his Hollywood arrival is Brit Paul Bettany, as Nash's enigmatic best friend - fulfilling the promise he showed in both 'Gangster No.1' and 'A Knight's Tale'.In truth it's the acting that makes the movie, for while Howard does a good job of actually making sums exciting - and pulls off a masterful narrative shift halfway through - he can't sidestep the pacing problems of biopics that try to cram in their subjects' entire life - perfunctorily whizzing through decades in the final half hour.Still, such problems are forgivable as the tear-stained finale crowns a moving love story.Who'd have thought algebra could be so exciting?",10,0,0,24 July 2017
American Made," Tom Cruise flies high as a fictional Barry Seal reaching heights he hasn't in years!
","Well, after Fargo turned out to be a totally made up story, I'm sure that most people have doubts on this movie. The back story of Pablo Escobar flying in coke to the US is true, the Oliver North selling the weapons via the Contra and the Iranians is true, the drug corruption of Col. Noreiga is all true, many elements are true as far as the back story, which makes for a great story. Actually, there was a Barry Seal, who did smuggle drugs, so that's why this story works well. Plus they really nailed the period dress, cars and boats that made for a great atmosphere. Plus there are funny tie-ins like George Bush, Ronald Reagan and even Bill Clinton. There was even some debate whether George Bush, ex head of the CIA had Barry killed or was it Escobar in a book by Shaun Attwood.So was this better than Mummy?Definitely, better. It shows the difference a well developed plot and characters can make in a movie. Plus I think this role really is a good fit for Tom Cruise, since we all know him as Top Gun. We all naturally assume he's a good pilot, so it always helps to have that background. The pilot Barry Seal is this bored TWA pilot approached by the CIA to start photographing all the USSR/Cuba communist supported troops in Central America. Of course he jumps at the opportunity having grown bored in a job similar to what we all have in life.How well does Sarah Wright play his wife Lucy? She helps to build up the common man wife of a pilot for the movie. She is actually from Kentucky, so that really helps give the Old South feel to the movie. Barry has to convince her of his nefarious dealings with the CIA despite losing their vaunted health care. Not sure if that's a jab at private health care, but she makes the sauce of the marriage work in the movie and is a great partner in crime for Barry. One of the best contrasts that really shows both of their original country roots is her cousin JB, who goes on to create endless trouble for the two. He really defines country stupid all around, but especially fits in Mene, Arkansas for the most part. How was the Pablo Escobar introduction handled? I think for the small part he plays in the movie, the actors playing his gang are impressive. They are the ultimate downfall of Barry, since he can't untangle himself as one of the key suppliers for Pablo in the movie. Barry looks aside the danger in the first bust, where he ends up losing a whole tooth in a Colombian jail. Luckily, his CIA pal Monty Schafer shows up and bails him out.The real Seal made daily deposits of $50,000 to his Honduran account through the early '80s. The filmmakers show him frantically burying duffle bags of cash in his backyard until he runs out of room because, well, that's funnier. Liman and Cruise want the audience to have a good time watching Seal play one side against the other. So comic scenarios are concocted out of whole cloth. In the film, for example, Seal pays regular visits to Manuel Noriega to pick up intel and deliver government payoffs. In real life, he may have used one of Noriega's runways.Nonetheless, American Made is an undeniably good time. It's briskly paced and amusingly absurdist. Cruise has rarely been as magnetic, perhaps because he's portraying a human being and not the kind of bulletproof action figure he's played for most of the past two decades. One thing the film isn't, though, is thoughtful.Even when Seal finds himself at the center of what would become the Iran-Contra scandal or is saved from jail by a last-minute call from president Bill Clinton, Liman and co. never pause to give events time to take on meaning. While that's a legitimate artistic choice, it's also a missed opportunity.It's fine to make a screwball comedy with government agencies running in circles like bureaucratic Marx Brothers. But I can't help imagining what this movie might have been if Liman had cut the engine occasionally, allowing viewers a moment to reflect on its ominous mix of Hollywood and history.With all the talk of making the country great again these days, we could use a wake-up call. Liman's film almost offers an unsettling reminder of the nightmare 'Morning in America' often was.",9,0,2,5 February 2018
Whiplash," One of the very best films of the 21st Century.
","Teacher-student relationships have always been heavily romanticized in movies for years; the ability to inspire young minds to believe in themselves in order to accomplish great things is no easy task. As expounded on, a year before Whiplash, in Blue is the Warmest Color, we all want guidance, a mentor, in this unknowable world and we try to find that in various outlets; one of those being our teachers and educators. Damien Chazelle's sophomore feature Whiplash begins with Andrew (Miles Teller) coming to think he has found that person in the demanding, hot-tempered and never-satisfied force-of-nature that is enigmatic Jazz Band Conductor Terrance Fletcher (J.K Simmons). There is the old introspective exercise of listing the most difficult teachers to get through their classes, then listing the teachers you got the most out of when you were their student, most of the time with those lists coinciding with one another one-to-one. It speaks to the things that push our limits actually in fact come to define who we are.Miles Teller reaches new heights as the the promising upstart Drumming talent enrolled at a Juilliard-esque University Conservatory music program. He can only see the castles in the sky for himself, he just needs to find a way to build the foundation to them. His turn in The Spectacular Now as the free spirited teenager Sutter, who gets a lesson in the school of hard knocks put him on the map, made him a talent to watch out for in the future. Here as Andrew; however, the actor is the very antithesis of the easy-going carefree teen in his previous movie. The guy knows what he wants and becomes incensed, doesn't let anyone get in the way of that and will do whatever it takes to get it.J.K. Simmons, in the role of his career so far, plays Terence Fletcher, a jazz band director at a prestigious music school in NYC, who represents, in a sense, the darkest parts of our self-conscious. He hurls insults, screams with frustration, and even threatens with physical and emotional pain. He infuses doubt so that those who 'have it' are separated from those 'who don't', or at least from those who 'can't take it'. A little bit of Fletcher is in all of us, putting ourselves down when we lack the courage to do something we want to do, but don't have the nerve to act on.If you have struggled to succeed and/or believe there is some grand purpose to your life that has yet to reveal itself, then you may find Damien Chazelle's fabulous Whiplash strangely revealing.",8,0,0,1 May 2018
Kong: Skull Island," It's hard to hate a movie that wants nothing more than to take you on a ride . . . Giant ride that is.
","Jordan Vogt-Roberts (of the Sundance breakout The Kings of Summer previously) delivered a fresh, new experience that honours the essential elements of the iconic character and provides big, monster movie matinée for an epic fun-time. Written by Dan Gilroy (Nightcrawler), Max Borenstein (2014's Godzilla), and Derek Connolly (Jurassic World), the movie follows a team of scientists, soldiers, and adventurers on a journey to explore a mythical, uncharted island in the Pacific, as dangerous as it is beautiful.If it was only spectacle and size that defined a great genre movie then 'Kong: Skull Island' would have had it all- unfortunately that's not the case. Size does matter, but not over and above aspects of story-telling and technicalities other than CGI, that help make a movie experience more real and involving. The representation of Kong as protector to the native tribesmen , other dwarfed inhabitants and aggressor to the bunched -up rest who puts his survival in peril, is also not clearly drawn. How does Kong differentiate between one human and the next, especially when they all come from the same group who invaded his island and made an attempt on his life? That's a question left unanswered.Although none of that should bother you.It's hard to hate on a movie that wants nothing more than to take you on a ride, and that's precisely what Kong: Skull Island does. With some truly jaw-dropping visuals from director of photography Larry Fong (of Watchmen, Lost, Super 8, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice), a colourful cast of thin but endearing characters, and some of the most bad-ass Kong action committed to the screen, Kong: Skull Island is a solidly entertaining entry in the ape's ever-expanding lore. And be sure to stay after the credits for a little tease at what's to come next from the 'MonsterVerse.' My inner-child was grinning ear-to- ear.",7,2,4,25 March 2017
Arrival," 'Non-zero-sum game!'
","Who are they? Why are they here? What are their purpose on earth?These are the fundamental questions asked in the new movie Arrival. Director Denis Villeneuve's newest film is a smart tale of mankind's first contact with aliens that boast a sophisticated narrative and nuances, great visuals, and strong performances from its small but effective ensemble cast. 'Arrival' is one of these such movie treats; an intellectually intelligent Sci-fi that's highly likely to be regarded as a genre classic in the years soon to come. Dennis Villeneuve (who has quickly become one of the industry's greatest current filmmakers), who here worked with screenwriter Eric Heisserer in adapting Ted Chiang's short story for the big screen, has created a Sci-fi event free of what you'd call large scale alien infused spectacle but instead filled a film with a quietly powerful narrative and ultimately stunningly moving centre that drives this unique vision to grand and near close to perfect Sci-fi heights. With all that's played out, a movie like Arrival about understanding aliens who communicate in a very different way than we do sounds pitch perfect for the kind of a week we've all had. After all, language is the cornerstone of our society, and we live in two very different Americas. To make things even better, the film is the latest in a string of successes by Prisoners and Sicario director Denis Villeneuve.Centered around the intriguing prospect of Amy Adams language expert Dr. Louise Banks, whose battling to figure out a way to communicate with an alien race that has decided to pay earth a potentially deadly visit, Arrival's narrative is best left relatively unspoken about as its complexities will be enjoyed that much more by those that know only minimal details about where Villeneuve and his talented cast are taking us.Anchored by what could well very be an Oscar nominated turn, Arrival rides off the back of Amy Adams central turn and while the increasingly impressive actress is ably supported by Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker, Arrival really is her film.Touching, thematically rich and visually robust (albeit a tad too sentimental in parts), Arrival is an ambitious, ultra-intelligent sci-fi drama, custom made for those who like a shot of 'smarts' with their popcorn — the film, dealing heavily with memory and loss, bound to get an emotional response from a handful of viewers. Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), a high ranking military official, pays Louise a visit and informs her that alien life has been found on these pods. He also informs her that he needs someone with her particular set of skills to learn how to communicate with these aliens and understand why they're here. With the help of scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), Louise is to make contact with the aliens and find a way to break the barriers of oral and verbal communication to figure out what is happening. Meanwhile, Louise has memories of raising a daughter she never had.'Non-zero-sum game!' — a situation where one's win does not necessarily mean another's loss, and one's loss does not necessarily mean that the other party wins. But in Arrival it's all about using the Weapon Language, the Cornerstone of CivilizationDespite grand visuals, grey cinematography, and a triumphant score, the film's defining hallmarks are its strong narrative, its nuanced direction, and its beautiful acting. You might require some patience and dedication but you won't be disappointed — Have some wine coolers with this one — it's a terrific film!",8,3,10,22 December 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," It is a brilliant prison melodrama with an unusual title
","The movie has excellent acting, excellent cinematography, and great music. Its one of those roller coasters of emotion movies that in the end leaves you feeling good. It's one of the best book to film transitions ever. Stephen King's may be best known for his horror writing but this is not horror. The movies success starts with the brilliant Steven King novel that it was based on 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'. You can find the novella in a 1982 King collection, 'Different Seasons', along with a story, 'The Body,' that became the basis for the another top notch movie the 1986 smash 'Stand by Me'. It celebrates the triumph of the human spirit. It's not a simple feel good movie- there is a good deal of brutality in it. As one of the characters explains: 'this is no fairy tale world.'It is about a 20 year friendship between two men in a prison (in my opinion). In telling that story the narrative highlights the memorable moments. The film is also about long-term imprisonment. The movie is not driving towards it's conclusion. A lot happens, and the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. The conclusion comes about as just another story among other stories. The story teller just saves the best story for last.The Bottom Line: It can be as much a spiritual experience as it is a simple movie. Turned into a classic!",9,0,0,31 October 2016
The Big Short," The Best Film Made On this Moment in History... Almost!
","If anyone hasn't seen 'The Big Short' yet, it comes highly recommended. Not only just it uncover the absolutely fraudulent nature of Wall-Street, in the years prior to the Financial Crisis, but it breaks down the various financial technicalities into easily palatable and understandable metaphors.Anyone else thinks this movie looks like it is set in the 80s and not 2005? I refuse to believe I dressed like that 10 years ago. The film stars a whole skew of Hollywood leading me to take on the shady men. most importantly, Ryan Gosling. Okay forget that part. It really is quite a movie: entertaining and engaging, but also mortifying; As Roger Ebert's website puts it: A good alternate title might be 'American Horror Story.'The movie is a fairly accurate portrayal of the events surrounding the initial financial shock which culminated in the 2008/09 Financial Crisis and excels in mixing humour and serious candour to communicate its message.How accurate was the subject matter of the movie? Pretty accurate really, and it is much better than reading the scathing 663 page report from the US Government on the subsequent crisis.Surprisingly, the screenplay is almost as well-structured, informative, and entertaining an adaptation of a complex work of non-fiction as Nicholas Pileggi's and Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. McKay and Randolph focus on just the right number of characters and find inventive ways to keep the movie light, funny, and easy to understand; yet their approach almost never devolves into shtick or patronizingly juvenile spoon-feeding of information. Unlike most documentaries about the causes of the global 2008 recession, The Big Short doesn't work backwards, investigating abstract causes and effects. Instead, it gives us compelling, quirky protagonists we can identify with and intertwines the minutia of the financial system into the goals, obstacles, and story arcs of these men. Though McKay and Randolph utilize several narrative devices I don't love—multiple narrators directly addressing the camera, breaking story continuity to explain complex concepts in whimsical ways, video clip montages meant to set time and place or contextualise ideas—these are few and far between and, for the most part, they work.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for McKay's directing style. I wish McKay, the head writer for Saturday Night Live during one of its stronger eras, had more faith in the written word, but his bloated, semi-improvised comedy features rush through as many jokes as possible, never fully allowing a whole to form from the sum of its parts. The hurried approach is even more injurious to this primarily dramatic feature. The Big Short is not a patient movie and therefore it's far less potent than J. C. Chandor's tense and secretive Margin Call (2011)—still the best film made on this moment in history. And should've won an Oscar for 'best picture' rather than just getting a nomination. You are free to disagree. But this is a movie that uses both cinema art and irrefutable facts to make its case. It's strong stuff. Especially, the cast was spectacular!I began off feeling wary about this motion picture: the haircuts and garments of the primary characters were more '90s music-video than mid 2000s, and the occasionally shading de-saturated flashbacks to a few characters' back stories were a little on the inauspiciously typical side. Be that as it may, the story force, joined with the base mind of a significant part of the exchange, and the submitted acting going ahead underneath the hairpieces, all did their employment. What's more, they got over the irate, skeptical conviction behind the motion picture, which is that the real banks all occupied with fake, criminal action, and that the U.S. government safeguarded them out to the detriment of the little person, and that there's no sign that the banks wouldn't accomplish something like precisely the same once more. You are allowed to oppose this idea. Be that as it may, this is a motion picture that utilizes both silver screen craftsmanship and evident realities to put forth its defence. It's solid stuff. The Big Short is a blended pack that I in any case prescribe seeing. Superior to anything any account or narrative film, TV show, or radio program I've yet observed or listened, it clarifies credit default swaps, subprime home loans, collateral's obligation commitments, and other money related builds in clear, intelligible terms. It abstains from damning things down to the point of haughtiness, yet by one means or another remaining parts a somewhat unblinking standard stimulation.",9,0,0,15 January 2017
Platoon," Platoon focuses on the moral decay of the soldiers in the most unpopular war in modern American history
","Many great war films of the Vietnam conflict are centered around these themes of blurred morality and the uselessness of war, and Oliver Stone's Platoon is among the most well known. Stone, who wrote and directed the film and also served as an infantryman in Vietnam, first rose to fame for his war films that dramatized the infamous Cold War conflict. The main premise of his magnum opus are the inner conflicts within US forces deployed to southeast Asia, rather than the actual physical conflicts between them and the Communist-allied Vietnamese forces. More broadly, Platoon analyzes the 'duality of man' concept that has been studied in numerous other works, from fellow Vietnam War films like Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979), all the way back to the latter's source material and inspiration in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Platoon focuses on the moral decay of soldiers in American units, and how this contributes to their inability to fight their Vietnamese enemies. Charlie Sheen sums up this theme with his on-the-nose voiceover, 'We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves... and the enemy was in us.'Vietnam War-movies tend to be even harder to watch than most war flicks, as the lines between the 'heroes' and 'villains' are blurred more than in any other dramatized period of warfare in recent human history. In wars like World War II, which are widely known for being as black and white as military conflicts have become, the contrasting features between the heroic forces we are meant to root for and their opposing enemy platoons are well defined. That is almost never the case with the United States-North Vietnamese/Vietcong conflict in Vietnam during the overarching Cold War.That is not to say that most wars throughout human history have not been many shades of grey, with the winners and losers not always corresponding with the righteous and evil. But because of the guerrilla nature and infamous legacy of the Vietnam War itself - namely, the immense public protest against American involvement - the Vietnam War remains by far the most unpopular war in modern American history. With that said, most of the film is fantastic, from the aforementioned narrative to the grim lightning of the southeast Asian jungles that emphasize the film's tone, to the poignant, melancholic score.",8,12,14,2 February 2018
Wonder Woman," The DC Extended Universe finally finds a balance between troubled philosophy and thrilling action through Wonder Woman.
","Like it or not, 'Wonder Woman' kicked some serious asses this year as Cinematic justice was served with a female-lead movie, and by a Woman!The few critics who have written sexist/poor reviews of the film (for reasons that are generally nothing to do with its calibre just FYI) have been roundly dragged by the Wonder Woman fans online. The worst of which came from the fans of DC's rival itself and those who are mostly blog writers, garnered a fair amount of negative attention for his scathing, salivating review of the film, in which they criticised Gal Gadot (Because the film's star is Israeli, duh!) and accuses positive critics of 'grading on a big curve' (um, ouch!). Meanwhile, Wonder Woman continued (still continues) to smash the pitifully low critics and the expectations of every film industry out there.(Sidebar: The two best and utterly shockingly genre-shifting superhero films of this year: Logan and Wonder Woman both will go down in history as comic-book genre landmarks).Wonder Woman, the film represents a number of delicate balancing acts: between humour and gravitas; angst and adventure; full-blown, unvarnished superhero fantasy and the DCEU's usual unpacking of what those fantasies mean. But its most impressive balancing routine may be the one that plays out between Steve and Diana over whether the Ares myth is real, and whether the histories of gods, Amazons, and magical hidden islands have any place in the modern world. The movie's opening act on Themyscira is out-sized and mythic, but once the story returns to Steve's familiar, grubby world, Wonder Woman seems like a surreal figure, a children's story brought to life. The people who see Diana seem to recognise that she's larger than life, no less startling than a unicorn walking through 1918 London. And yet there are no heroes yet in their world, so the characters have a strong urge to treat Diana as just another strikingly beautiful woman — in other words, to protect her, sideline her, and politely diminish her. And without making a fuss about it, she is in no way willing to be diminished. She's a fish out of water in 1918 London, which gives Wonder Woman a fair number of comedy pegs and opportunities for banter — and also its strongest feminist leanings, as Steve tries to control and contain Diana, and she shrugs him off and does whatever makes sense to her instead. But she's also the ultimate home-schooled kid, confidently operating under assumptions that have never come up against real-world facts. Wonder Woman gets its philosophical bent from the conflict between her pure, untested idealism and the actual gruesome realities of war, and it finds rich ground in the gap between them.Such high stakes for women filmmakers and female superheroes — Jenkins' Wonder Woman is being hyped as a litmus test for whether modern cinema audiences will pack theatres to watch a superhero movie with a woman protagonist, and whether a woman director can bring the blockbuster action. But while Wonder Woman is supremely calculated in its gender politics and its gender role reversals, the question of how a female hero sees the world winds up being less interesting than the question of how an entirely self-assured hero sees it. The DCEU's Batman and Superman are both tormented by their solitude and their histories; as a one-of-a-kind being, Wonder Woman takes her solitude for granted, and her history is almost entirely of her own choosing. Her femininity is part of the story, for the way it makes even the other heroes in the movie underestimate and discount her. But her gender is never the story's primary thrust.Instead, Wonder Woman focuses on the horrors of war, the pleasures of camaraderie, and plain, old-fashioned super-heroics. The DCEU's Batman tortures criminals and tries to murder Superman, while Superman himself accidentally destroys cities, and is forced to murder villains. Wonder Woman simply fights injustice and saves lives. It is, frankly, a relief.This is indeed a tremendous win for a franchise that desperately needed one. Doesn't matter whether you're a Marvel fan or a DC fan, this isn't about you or your fandom, it's about the industry and the whole comic-book genre itself. This DC movie has the charm to burn. And that's no back-hand compliment. It's genuine praise. This is nit-picking of the highest order. Wonder Woman is a solid Crowd-Pleaser, so go join the crowd!",9,4,12,25 July 2017
Black Panther," Black Panther does a little more than an average MCU film
","With his regal demeanour, noble disposition, and unquestionable ability to kick an ass or 20, Chadwick Boseman's T'Challa proved himself worthy of the Black Panther suit in Captain America: Civil War. Had his solo film expanded on these three qualities, while delivering the necessary fights and funnies that define the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it would have made for a good film. Ryan Coogler's Black Panther does much more.Like most of the films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the plot runs by a tried-and-true blueprint. This time, it follows the footsteps of the first Thor with story beats surrounding royalties, loyalties, betrayals, outcasts and family secrets that feel familiar (sometimes predictable). However, they play naturally to the majestic and technologically advanced world of Wakanda.If anyone deserves to retire as kings and queens, it's the art department. There's so much creativity displayed in the makeup, costuming, sets, and sci-fi designs that a single watch cannot absorb it all. From the striking attire of the Dora Milaje warriors to the sand-like magnetic thingy-ma-bobs that power Wakandan tech, every detail adds wonderment to a world that imagines an African culture gifted with near-unlimited resources and untainted by colonialism.The poisons of history play a big part in Black Panther - not just with colonialism, but with any past act that later proves to be problematic. This is what powers Michael B Jordan's Killmonger, a vicious yet sympathetic adversary with enough depth to make him one of the more memorable villains in the MCU.However, the true knockout stars are Lupita Nyong'o as Wakandan spy Nakia and Danai Gurira as Dora Milaje general Okoye. They're given multiple times to shine using both their heroic fists and their stand-up comedy routines while sticking to their own rounded subplots.Weirdly enough, Get Out's Oscar-nominated star Daniel Kaluuya ends up falling a little flat as commander W'Kabi, using a casual 'did you just fart?' face for almost every confrontation. His relationship with Okoye also seems non-existent until the film coughs it up during an otherwise exciting climax. But those are minor complaints for a film that feels gargantuan in almost every other way.",6,1,2,29 April 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The (K)Night is Darkest just before the Dawn
","It is said that the darkest hour of the night comes just before the dawn. And as Harvey Dent promised you, the dawn was coming. It's here. In other words, It's time to really go and watch this film. No one is criticising it anymore. Because no need for that right now. The ones who intentionally downplayed it, well, they've served their purpose and were pretty good at it. Others are actually misguided or just misunderstood the darker tone as the film overindulging in the morbid atmosphere of 'Man of Steel', (and since it's a BATMAN MOVIE!), when in fact it was paving a path for the more humorous Justice League. And in between you get the upcoming epic: Wonder Woman. History was just in the making but in a way we weren't familiar with.As populist effigies go, the aloof, out-of-touch critic who who dismisses popular entertainment in favour of high-minded so-called 'art' that only they understand (or care about) is pretty evergreen – mostly because, like any good myth, it has one foot in reality. The business of entertainment reporting and cultural-criticism are such that critics are required to experience hundreds of films (or books, or games, or whatever other discipline) throughout the year, and thus grow more quickly tired of clichés and more sensitive to technical flaws. Plus, sometimes critics really do get it wrong. It took the 'establishment' film press around 3-4 sequels to notice that the Fast & Furious franchise was delivering on diversity and (nominally) progressive post-traditional family-dynamics like few other mainstream films had dared, but global audiences had been rewarding it for that all along. Conversely, the perceived 'elitism' of critics makes it easy for some to imagine them as powerful enough (or thinking themselves so) to use their platform to advance a nefarious agenda rather than critique from objectivity (whatever that means anymore(. That's the premise of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead (which Zack Snyder himself is angling to adapt into a new feature film) where the villain is an architecture critic who uses his influence to ruin the careers of artists in order to advance his own political/cultural worldview, and also of Ratatouille, where Anton Ego takes malevolent pride in destroying Gasteau in part because he objected to the chef's populist 'Anyone can cook!' message.There are more than just a handful of brilliantly realised moments, the acting is mostly strong despite the weak script (Affleck, Gadot, Cavill and Adams were superb but Affleck unexpectedly was the best!), and there's enough mythic raw material sunk deep in every scene that you can piece together a classic in your mind if you're feeling charitable; But Jesse Eisenberg's Luthor. . . Eisenberg's performance as the villainous Lex Luthor (Check: he was playing Lex Luthor right?) was, you know, not what I'd encourage, he literally JOKER-ed the SUPER out of the Villain! While it wasn't the worst but it did manage to break the film down a little. But was it really his performance that ruined the movie altogether before it even came out?Look: I get where he was coming from in his approach to his character. After all, he's playing a super-crazy villain with super- crazy mental problems. But every stutter, every tick felt very calculated and clichéd, as if he'd crafted his performance after taking a class in Super-villains 101. Ultimately, though, this one may be on director Zack Snyder. A more nuanced actor's director, like, say, Darren Aronofsky, might have saved the movie by asking Eisenberg to take it down a notch. Letting him run wild just didn't work.Now, why would you Rip-off of Heath Ledger's Joker? Or if not, why wouldn't you notice the damn fact that you're unintentionally Ripping a Clown off?Perhaps it was because Dawn of Justice is at least half a Batman movie, perhaps it was because The Dark Knight was just really freaking' good. Whatever the case, it was hard to watch Eisenberg's performance and not think back to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan's modern-day superhero classic. Eisenberg's speech patterns and mannerisms felt almost entirely lifted from Ledger's iconic performance, to the point where he walked the dangerous grey line between respectful homage and downright thievery. We understand why Eisenberg might have wanted to go that route; after all, Ledger won an Oscar for his performance, and set the bar extremely high for all super-villains to come. Still, the whole thing felt too familiar. In any other movie Eisenberg would've gotten a decent share of praise for his performance but this wasn't any other movie. It was the biggest film DC ever made. It's a Batman movie. It's a Superman movie. It's the best film we've been lucky enough to witness first hand.While it still deserved it's fair share of praise. Especially due to Ben Affleck's 'badass' portrayal of Bruce Wayne. Batman ruled.Comic books are, first and foremost, a visual medium. Such importance placed on making a good-looking project should translate over to films that adapt these stories for the big screen. While the phrase 'style over substance' holds a lot of merit, it should not impede efforts by filmmakers to translate images to the big screen in a way that resonates with audiences. Zack Snyder was trying to create a visceral experience that would not be forgotten, and he did accomplish this. Love it or hate it. AND the DVD fleshes out subplots and adds the much needed restoration of the cuts and character beats and yes, the additional scenes. Not only did the new cut feature additional footage, it also changed the rating of the movie to an 'R' from 'PG- 13' as several more brutal story beats were brought to light.This is a late review for the ones who haven't seen it yet. (Try to get the DVD and go see it now!)",10,3,5,28 April 2017
Blade Runner," Ridley Scott's Stylish Dystopian Masterpiece!
","Ridley's visionary portrait of a futuristic Los Angeles 2019 (more like Tokyo City, Japan to me) with its looming video-screened high-rises, neon- lit blimps, and rain-spattered noodle shops where the ordinary JOE's eat. As one of Britain's finest ever films, 'Blade Runner' went from cult classic to an universally acknowledged masterpiece. It's probably the most visually dense film, with every frame brimming with detail and vitality, every bit of chiaroscuro adding to the film's melancholy mood. And it's one hell of a Cinema landmark, which at the same time, works as a blissful 'aide-mémoire'—that some films just deserve a second freaking chance!At its initial release the film was a flop. To be fair, the theatrical cut of the film contained an unnecessary Harrison Ford voice-over as well as an ending that felt a bit too conventional for a film as bold as Blade Runner. Possible Reasons: It was the 80's and let's fact it, Ford wasn't exactly Robert De Niro who can god-smack the film's audience with just his narration skills and set the tone for it entirely. The rest of the blame can be given towards the studio executives whose moronic views, unnecessary edits and constant interfering almost ruined one of 80's most famous leading member of the Brit-pack: Ridley Scott's career. However, as Ridley began to work on a cut closer to his original vision and the film began to be seen by more and more people, it became considered one of the pinnacles of science fiction in film. For Ridley, this was extremely ambitious. Even today there's something about the scope and detail of the world that comes across as maddening and innovative. And the problem with ambitious creations is that not everyone is going to get it. While other Sci-Fi films from the same year (The Thing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) offered film audiences heavy doses of suspense, action and adventure, Blade Runner is a film where characters espouse philosophical treatises while behaving strangely.Even to this day I'm astounded by how many people love this film given the fever-pitched insanity of the final act. Rutger Hauer howls like a wolf, taunts Harrison Ford in singsong, drives a nail through his hand and then gives one of the most iconic (and, if we're honest, indulgent) monologues in cinema. Even while I giddily enjoy the last few moments of the film, I sometime ask myself how so many people can end up loving something that is this esoteric and bizarre.The film is saturated in melancholy, overshadowed by death and peopled by ghosts. Visually and bionically, it is awash with haematological whispers.It shows a gritty, Noir-like, rain-soaked vision of a Dystopic future Los Angeles in which government sanctioned bounty-hunters (Blade Runners) are used to track down and 'retire' human-looking robots known as Replicants. Loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, director Ridley Scott's film is a complex, thought-provoking meditation on what it means to be human. With its striking visual imagery, moody soundtrack and advanced special- effects, Blade Runner is that rare Science Fiction movie that spends as much time setting a mood as it does discussing its big ideas. And while it may not be as exciting or revolutionary as more action-oriented movies like Star Wars or The Matrix, its cerebral nature and thematic ambiguity is what has made it a cult classic and landed it atop many critics lists of the top Science Fiction movies of all time. Most Film Directors, who have finished a Science-Fiction film, tend to choose something a little more down to earth for their next project. Ridley, coming off with the Academy Award winning — 'Alien (1979)' — launched himself into something even more stylised and visually dense: 'Blade Runner (1982)' — Hailed for its production design, depicting a 'retrofitted' future, it remains a leading example of the Neo-Noir genre. Although the film under-performed in North American theatres, but has since become a cult classic. It's a movie that announces its impending awesomeness with authority. And style. Even, Ridley himself regards Blade Runner as 'probably' his most complete and personal film. Quick, go and watch this movie before it's 2049!",10,0,1,2 June 2017
Trainspotting," Choose Life. Choose Britain's Greatest Ever Film!
","'Trainspotting' – The knockabout 1996 heroin-addict ensemble piece which put Danny Boyle and Ewan McGregor on the map, immortalised Irvine Welsh's bestselling novel and proved a shot in the arm for 1990's British Cinema and it's greatest creation.It is the 1996 British black comedy-drama film which starred Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle, and Kelly Macdonald. A classic which underwent the direction of Danny Boyle, the narration of Ewan McGregor and a screenplay by John Hodge based on the novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh — resulting in an unexpected pop culture phenomenon, defining not only the 90's generation but setting the future tone for British Film Institute as well. It's a film that made British cinema seem exciting again and restored its golden period rather than a fusty factory of period dramas which was ongoing for half a decade. And it became a classic that is still being talked about today, with a sequel finally on the way in less than a month. It is often described as black comedy, but I would liken it more to a drama with a crude, dark sense of humour. Trainspotting is the rare drug addiction-tale to tackle serious material without taking itself too seriously.Although set in Edinburgh, almost all of the film was shot in Glasgow, apart from the opening scenes, which were shot in Edinburgh, and the final scenes which were shot in London. The film showcases the misadventures of mainly five young men in Edinburgh trying to find their way out of joblessness, aimlessness to aimless relationships and relentless drug addiction. Some are successful, while others hopelessly are not. The title, 'Trainspotting' is a metaphor. The 'Trans- Potters' are people playing a kind of game is to watch the trains go all day and record their numbers. This game is synonymous with boredom and from all forms of addictive or compulsive activity, so you can make a comparison with the drug. But the metaphor can also represent, as Renton sees trains to take, opportunities to stop the drugs and leave his friends, but he does nothing, except at the end where he took his chance and chose the train (of life). The film's story-line eventually divulges into an epic tale of struggle with both addiction and poverty through the lives of these young drug users or heroin addicts, trying to make their own journeys.Renton, a pro heroin-addict, played by McGregor is the main protagonist. He is also the narrator as the film centres around his life and the scuffles he undergoes with addiction. Although he eventually wants to change his life and quit heroin. But his willpower gets caught in between his junk habit and his never-ending lust for one final shot before he'd quit or can finally quit. He believes: when you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. Human relationships and all the other things really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.All the characters in this film, apart from Renton are also well defined and have very specific characteristics. However, they share the same idea: to escape society's rules by taking drugs, each in his own way. They refuse to integrate the universal mode and the consumer society, much more despaired than they are. This aversion is clearly shown by the image of the parents of Renton, leading a sordid life and bouffant of entertainment in their pathetic homes. Mark, Spud and Sick Boy choose drugs to touch the bottom, that is to say, the sense of life.McGregor is more than ably abetted by a superb supporting cast, including Jonny Lee Miller as suave, Byronesque sociopath Sick Boy, Robert Carlyle as snarling, repressed, hard-drinking psychopath Begbie, and Ewen Bremner as the endearingly inept Spud. Their behaviour towards one another is often deplorable, but the film is propelled by an underlying sense of camaraderie. As critic Roger Ebert so astutely observed at the time: 'The reason there is a fierce joy in Trainspotting, despite the appalling things that happen in it, is that it's basically about friends in need.'The actual theme of the film was rather simple. Friends are your companions through bad times and good times as they say but with Renton's situation, these friends are actually an option. Would you take them or not? Being comfortable and at ease with your friends is good as long as we know our limitations because friends can't always prank you on what's on their minds.",10,1,2,25 March 2017
The Deer Hunter," The most emotionally shattering Vietnam War movie ever made!
","Michael Cimino's filmmaking journey was hardly a bump-less ride. It seems that his name is unfortunately doomed to go down in history as of a director whose third film completely ruined his career—Heaven's Gate not only led a distinguished American studio into bankruptcy, but also enraged critics and the audiences to a degree of making every Cimino's future project destined to fail, both critically and commercially. After his second feature, the world simply expected him to keep delivering in the future. It's extremely difficult to live up to that kind of expectation when you introduce yourself to the world with a film like The Deer Hunter. The gloomy all-American epic story of three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania deeply and differently affected by the Vietnam war completely swept the United States off their feet back in 1978, earning five Academy Awards and turning the world's spotlights on Cimino in the process.The movie has two important themes: friendship and war. With 'The Lord of the Rings' featuring a somewhat full-blown friendship between Frodo and Sam (that sometimes borders on being overly- sentimental but works), 'The Deer Hunter' represents a portrait of true, powerful friendship. This is superior to any of the scenes between Frodo and Sam in 'The Lord of the Rings,' the characters here are more realistic and empathetic, the performances more convincing. When he finds Nicky surrounded by men putting wagers on his life, Michael tries to bring him home, but Nicky just spits in his face. To reveal his feelings for Nicky, Michael holds a gun to his own head. 'Is this what you want?' he taunts. 'I love you, Nicky.' And then he pulls the trigger and the barrel clicks: empty. Michael's face suddenly drains, a reflection of his inner relief.The reason why the film is lengthy is because it rolls out like a legend rather than a documentary and its greatness is blunted by its length and one-sided point of view, but the film's weaknesses are overpowered by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, John Savage, John Cazale and Christopher Walken. But it's the De Niro character, Michael 'Mike' Vronsky, the one that somehow finds the strength to keep going and to keep Savage and Walken going. Both on and off-screen, De Niro, as usual plays his part brilliantly. He survives the prison camp and helps the others. Then, finally home from Vietnam, he is surrounded by a silence we can never quite penetrate. He is touched vaguely by desire for the girl that more than one of them left behind, but does not act decisively. He is a 'hero,' greeted shyly, awkwardly by the hometown people.The film perfectly manages to close it curtains (for America as well) with everyone at John's bar, singing 'God Bless America'. And they reverentially (freeze-framed) raise their beer mugs to Nick, as Michael toasts 'Here's to Nick.'In truth, Cimino's The Deer Hunter has not aged as well as its younger brother, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), but there are many legitimate reasons for this. Apocalypse Now was always imperfect, and, in ways no one could have anticipated; its very messiness, inscrutability, and shoehorned ending only gain stature as the perfect metaphor for the imperfect fiasco that was Vietnam.",10,4,8,25 July 2017
Life," 'Its curiosity outweighs its fear'
","Calling Daniel Espinosa's Life an Alien retread is the easy thing to do. Both are tensely claustrophobic science fiction films with a violent extraterrestrial that's loose and in search of the crew. But it's also a very reductive comparison considering they are nothing alike beside genre conventions. The missions are different. The time period is different. And the creature's motivation is as dissimilar as can be. Life also can't help but stand apart on its own for one reason: it could actually happen tomorrow. We aren't readying deep space probes to find forgotten spacecraft. Mankind isn't tempting fate by forcing its control over the unknown (yet). What we are doing, however, is looking. We are visiting Mars and taking samples. We are experimenting with re-animating dormant microbial life.Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick aren't therefore creating a horrific scenario out of thin air with H.R. Giger aesthetics and sky's-the- limit reach as far as imagination. They're instead writing about the pitfalls of the next logical step. If we find a single-celled organism trapped in crystal that's lived as recently as 450,000 years ago, we will attempt to bring it back. Call it science or hubris or both, it's imperative to continue our study of biology and perhaps a key to solving disease on Earth. So, like the CDC's Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), Reese and Wernick extrapolate the worst-case result of this and let it happen. North does this to ensure fail-safes aboard the International Space Station; the filmmakers do it to watch the aftermath of failure.We therefore know these astronauts. They're like those who inhabit the ISS every year. There's North's microbiologist in charge of everyone's safety against the mysterious organism they hope to study. There's David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), the resident physician and ex-Marine who's been in space for over a year; Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), the mission specialist with the engineering know-how to fix mechanical issues and operate the station's robotic arm while spacewalking; Sho Murakami (Hiroyuki Sanada), the navigator/pilot awaiting the birth of his first child back home; Commander Ekaterina Golovkina (Olga Dihovichnaya), the woman in charge of the mission; and Hugh Derry (Ariyon Bakare), the scientist tasked with coaxing their Martian awake. They're all qualified to be there and each possessed by a mixture of fascination and fear.So what happens? The usual. But saying that doesn't mean it's boring. It's instead as authentic as a science fiction film can be since everyone stays in character and works towards finding a balance between curiosity and caution. While we get some fun with Reynolds playing the group's cocksure cowboy whose job it is to catch the shuttle holding their prospective specimen that's hurtling through space off-course, the camaraderie between all is actually quite entertaining itself because they enjoy each other's company. They're watching each other's backs and having a good time while operating in the awe-inspiring realm of space's vacuum. They go about their business and keep their well-oiled machine rolling. And they remain on the opposite side of glass from Derry and the alien. Space is old hat. Aliens are not. The creature isn't built to be scary, but real. This is a living entity with undifferentiated cells—meaning its entire make-up is one hundred percent eyes, muscle, brain, and nerves. Its rate of growth is exponential as Derry feeds it, their relationship harmonious and civil as though it were a pet until an accident changes the dynamic. Like humans have done for centuries, we react as soon as something surprising occurs. We play with fire despite not knowing whether our experiment can be burned. We're cognisant to the reality that we've hurt it in a way to put its defences up, but we're too impatient to let its fear play out. So we poke, prod, and intimidate until it has but one choice: to fight back.Our mistake is assuming we're at the apex of the food chain. This may be true on Earth (and only because of our capacity to invent and use weapons), but not necessarily elsewhere. It only takes one mistake, no matter how well meaning, to turn the tables and move from offence to defence. Whatever you think you can do to stop this thing will just as likely make it stronger. To place logic and earthly properties onto it is to become trapped within a box devoid of escape. There's no malicious intent or superiority on behalf of the alien (coined 'Calvin'). It simply needs food, air, and water. Unfortunately, it has the means to acquire those things in ways that render us impotent to stop it.Its quest for freedom leads to a cat and mouse chase we've seen before. But familiar doesn't mean ineffective. Motivations are revealed early and each character stays true to them. Their actions are believable and the overall severity in response to their situation is pertinent to mankind's existence. It's a suspenseful journey from one death to the next as they constantly underestimate its instincts and overestimate their pragmatism. One could say Life is also a metaphor for our earthly actions. To continue assuming we know what's right by treating the 'other' as enemy is to facilitate our own destruction. Searching to discover isn't the same as searching for power. And believing we're prepared for what that hubris delivers is nothing short of suicide. This film understands that cost.",7,4,10,1 May 2017
Deadpool," 'Bad Deadpool - Good Deadpool Film!'
","If anyone else could be cast to play Deadpool, he certainly doesn't exist in this universe. After Ryan Reynolds's dramatic failure in the Green Lantern film, he has returned to the comic book world. Reynolds is absolutely phenomenal as the foul mouthed, and witty anti hero. I mean he is just superb! He completely owns the role, and gives a fantastic performance. If Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, then Ryan Reynolds IS Deadpool. He is also such a liveable character, and by the end of the film, I genuinely cared about Deadpool. I never thought I'd say that. All of the performances are great. No one holds a candle to Reynolds, but I will say not one person was miscast here.Deadpool is a unique film, and a huge gamble. Both Marvel and the studios bringing us this film took a major risk. This is a beloved character, and his world is very different than other Marvel films. Right off the bat, this film is consciously self-aware. It knows its a comic book film with comic book characters, and it actually exploits it. Many times, Deadpool turns to the audience and tells us what we're all thinking. It was so different, and it worked so very well. The narrative itself is also different. It's very non-linear. The events of the film don't play out in a normal straight narrative.One of the trademarks, nay, the trademark of Deadpool is his sense of humour. This film is by far one of the most hysterical films I have seen in some time. The writing is so perfect, so sharp, and so full of witty banter, and thankfully, it all works. Not one joke, that I remember, fell flat. The film had me laughing constantly; from the opening credits, all the way to the after credits scene.As for the action, it's also very satisfying. Many action films today are butchered by terrible camera work. For whatever reason, many modern action films are using shaky cam. Instead of clear, steady shots, the DP will go hand held, and shake the camera violently. The worst example in recent memory of this is, Taken 3. Thankfully, there are films like this, and others, that know exactly how to do a good action scene. Director Tim Miller and cinematographer Ken Seng do a brilliant job creating slick, good looking action. Not only is the action brutal, and extremely bloody, it's just co clear and well handled. The fights are really great here. I couldn't help but be reminded of Tarantino's, Kill Bill films while watching Deadpool. They are incredibly similar in their style of fight scenes.Sitting in the cinema, the inner critic in me struggled internally. I kept thinking afterwards about the film. What were the flaws? I don't often see a film without pointing out the negatives. Even films I really like, or even love, have flaws. I'm certain that if one sits and picks this apart, you will eventually find some flaws. Perhaps the overall story is paper thin. Perhaps the villain wasn't very compelling as character. Then again, Ajax was honestly serviceable. Ed Skrein gave a great performance, and by the end, you really hate the bastard. He's a generic, or a dick, British villain and the film makes fun of that!'Deadpool' and Guardians of the Galaxy were both huge risks that ultimately paid off, big time. As a film, it's nearly perfect. The film does exactly what it needed to do, and more. It introduces Deadpool, sets up his character, and gets you to like him if you didn't already. The non linear narrative was refreshing to see in a superhero film. Everything about this film was different and unique. It's self awareness and breaking of the fourth wall work well; really well. The direction is great, Ryan Reynolds is phenomenal, and the script is fantastic!",9,91,145,14 December 2016
Cloud Atlas," 'Everything Is Connected'
","In general films released today follow a broad structure of three acts, with the setup, the obstacle and the resolution. There are some films however that bend and manipulate this structure and try and create something more fluid. Then there are films that are pure and utter madness. A chaos of ideas and themes that distinctly do not follow the classical structure. Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, Cloud Atlas is a sprawling epic, historical, science fiction film that covers six distinct time periods from early settlers in the United States to a post-apocalyptic savage land after the 'fall of humanity' and it's quite unlike almost any other film around.To say that Cloud Atlas gets confusing would be an understatement. Directors Tom Tykwer, Lana and Andy Wachowski have suggested that artistic expression is meant to be confusing and boundary-pushing and they've certainly put their money where their mouths are here. The narrative sweeps along tying characters and their actors together by shared roles and themes, investigating fate, history, love and progression.The film itself was never destined to be popular. When David Mitchell published a novel featuring six different stories set in six different time periods, nested one inside the other like Russian dolls, Hollywood said an adaptation was impossible. When the Wachowski Siblings bought the rights to the book, studios were still doubtful. Even after the film had been financed, investors backed out left and right. Nobody but the filmmakers seemed to believe that audiences could handle a movie this big.Although, despite the haste, I adore Cloud Atlas. It's huge, smart, ambitious, profound—everything a Hollywood film ought to be. And I'm not alone in saying so. The movie received a ten-minute standing ovation at its premiere at most Film Festivals—a sign that the filmmakers had created something very special. Only later did the negative buzz begin. But those movie-goers who enjoyed Cloud Atlas didn't just like it—they loved it, passionately. Some have even called this film a masterpiece. So who's right?",9,0,1,24 July 2017
The Thin Red Line," It's not 'that other war movie of 1998'
","'The Thin Red Line,' being released so close to 'Saving Private Ryan', is destined to be called 'that other war movie of 1998.' This is very unfortunate and definitely very wrong. For, 'The Thin Red Line' is not just another brutal war movie. It is a visual and thematic masterpiece. In any other year, this would've probably been the highlight, rather than being dubbed as an imitation of Spielberg's war-epic.For sure, 'The Thin Red Line' is not as disturbing to watch as 'Saving Private Ryan' is. Even though, this film capture the war- genre more accurately. It is a complete fiction, (so is Saving Private Ryan) but at least this one is more true to the horrors of warfare. Though not as nearly as graphic, the directing seems to produce a very suspenseful and uncomfortable connection to the battles at hand. Thus, be warned that parts of this movie can be very hard to watch, and are certainly not for everyone. The violence at least is not an end in itself, and serves to illustrate the sacrifice and madness young men endured in WWII to fight for our freedom. In these respects, 'The Thin Red Line' is similar to 'Saving Private Ryan'. One might well ask why watch two such gruesome features in one year?The actors in 'The Thin Red Line' are making one movie, and the director is making another. This leads to an almost hallucinatory sense of displacement, as the actors struggle for realism, and the movie's point of view hovers above them like a high school kid all filled with big questions. My guess is that any veteran of the actual battle of Guadalcanal would describe this movie with an eight-letter word much beloved in the Army.The bigger problem which will come to mind when people seen it in recent years: the voice-overs of the characters' thoughts. The problem is that not one of these voice-overs is realistic in the least. They all seem to be written by the same poet or philosopher who has never actually been to war, but has seen a couple good war movies and read a few war novels. He is thinking in the style of 'The Grand Poetry of War,' which is sharply at odds with everything that is happening on screen. Their thoughts are not real, nor do they seem to be real; they are obvious fabrications meant to manipulate us into thinking of war in romantic terms. The language is beautiful, and the metaphors accurately describe the horrors of war. But unless the company shown in the movie is made up completely of Yale English professors, the voice-overs feel far removed from the individual thinking the thoughts. On the other hand, the Japanese throughout are totally depersonalised (in crucial scenes, their language is not even translated with subtitles); seen as enemies so much as necessary antagonists--an expression of nature's compulsion to 'contend with itself.'Sidebar: 'Saving Private Ryan' wins in terms of scary scenes, but nothing like the constant terror seen in the eyes of Malick's actors. And they all manage to do this with a relatively small amount of screen-time.",8,0,2,29 June 2017
Annihilation," A 'Heart-Popping' Thriller!
","A few months from now, there will a daily heat index to monitor and football derbies to watch and weekend beach trips to plan. And you'll still be thinking about the closing moment of Annihilation.I would not dare delve into it, only to say that it's one of the sci-fi thriller's many searing images. This is the brand of film that moviegoers should crave: Cerebral in its story and heart-stopping in its pacing. You thought Alex Garland's previous film, Ex Machina, was wickedly disturbing? The English writer-director delivers a similar meditation on the cutting power struggle between man and science - only now he's been given a sky-high budget. The result is a stellar, dazzling wowzer that opens itself up to theories galore. That's the mark of a true Thumbs Up.Annihilation is a ferocious, feral, female-centric update of fearsome monster classics like The Thing and Alien. Garland shows an unerring hand in building a sense of unease about what evil lurks in a forest that's been taken over by some kind of 'other,' and then making it pay off. An enjoyable film for most of you. 
But a 'Must-See,' surely.",9,2,5,17 April 2018
The Nice Guys," A funnier version of Lethal Weapon
","I saw 'The Nice Guys' just when it came out since it was coming from the same writer as the original Lethal Weapon movie, (while not to mention the two lead actors are from Canada and NZ) one has to wonder if that same magic has been captured again in this weird looking 'buddy movie' or not, right? The 1970's: Captured 90% but Recreated 200%.Set in 1970's Los Angeles, The Nice Guys sees a pair of detectives hunting down information in relation to a missing porn star, who's disappeared from the public eye in what appears to be a suicide. Sounds pretty standard, right? Like any good plot, there's a massive conspiracy going on underneath the surface.When they first meet on screen, Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) assaults his (soon to be) partner, Holland March (Ryan Gosling). This important scene sets the tone for what is to come later, as the two, who both exude a strong screen presence, have a natural chemistry with one another.It's like a remake of The Classic Odd Couple as Nice Guys, starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe - while you might get a turn-off instantly just by looking at the poster or the mediocre trailer but take my advice: go for it! Laugh your arse of with some real laugh out loud moments in this movie.Shane Black, famed for another buddy cop movie in Lethal Weapon, has managed to recreate some magic in terms of entertainment and straight out fun. Perhaps his re-pairing with Lethal Weapon producer, Joel Silver, helps here somewhat.Both Crowe and Gosling play their roles well, and believably so at that. Russell Crowe has always been believable as a hard man in movies, and he is well cast here. Gosling, on the other hand, has a wide variety of roles behind him that are memorable, and this is another that can be added to that long list.But as under-rated as it is, it is filled with truly hysterical moments, several bits of physical comedy that Gosling pulls off throughout the movie, combined with the excellent straight man work by Crowe, the two actors become a surprisingly brilliant comedy duo, carrying 'The Nice Guys' past one or two flat jokes, needed edits and a cluttered finale.",10,2,4,24 July 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," To be honest, one is reluctant to enjoy this film
","'Who was more insane? Me, or every other person?' In 'Mad Max: Fury Road,' Miller has pushed his Gilliam-esque vision of a world gone distraught to its sensible extraordinary. Never again are the general population of Max Rockatansky's reality just scroungers for oil or power; they have been changed into animals of condition, either left with one characterising need or left with no similarity of reason. 'Fury Road' is a fierce film, yet the rough demonstrations in this world don't feel like subjective activity beats—they rise up out of an entire absence of different alternatives or a firm feeling of straight-up madness. Mill operator's new vision of Max isn't a warrior. Or maybe, he's a man driven by the recollections of past sins to do minimal more than survive. He strolls with the phantoms of those he couldn't spare, and his voyaging allies have pushed him to the edge of rational soundness. While meandering at this edge, Max is abducted and changed into a strict blood sack for a non domesticated warrior named Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who serves the impulses of his twisted ruler, Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne, who additionally played the reprobate Toecutter in the first 'Mad Max'). From the begin, Miller gives you no opportunity to 'straightforwardness' into this world or the story he needs to tell. The edge rate is quickened, the altering is hyperactive, the awful person talks through a veil that makes a large portion of his exchange garbled (shades of Hardy's Bane from 'The Dark Knight Rises'), and the terrible dreams of Miller's turned future come quick and incensed. Immortan Joe is a scarcely alive irregularity of nature, continued breathing by tubes associated with his face and served by correspondingly distorted half-people with complete names like Rictus Erectus (Nathan Jones) and The People Eater (John Howard). One of Joe's most striking warriors is an effective lady known as Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), who, as the film opens, is driving an escort from Immortan Joe's fortification to the oil refinery Gastown when she digresses off kilter. Things being what they are Furiosa has captured Joe's 'reproducers,' the ladies he keeps detainee with an end goal to make a male beneficiary. She's taking them to 'the green place,' to well-being. Obviously, Joe sends his men after Furiosa—including Nux, to whom Max is still appended— and whatever is left of 'Mad Max: Fury Road' comprises of one since quite a while ago supported pursue over the unforgiving desert. Except for one centrepiece of discourse, the film happens altogether moving, speeding, pursuing, ricocheting, and detonating over Miller's seared scene. As an impression of more edgy circumstances, Miller has redesigned the necessities of his future world from wares like oil to immaculate survival. Max has been rethought as a battling, driving machine, a man who 'discovers his own specific manner,' pushing ahead trying to surpass his apparitions. Nux is a mentally conditioned goon, a man-animal who trusts that he will pass on and be renewed subsequent to relinquishing himself for an excursion to Valhalla. Max in the long run ventures into the part of the activity legend, at the same time, in one of his most brave moves, Miller gives the heaviness of the story to Furiosa, a lady who clutches the main thing that could give her trust in this vicious world—the people to come. Theron does apparently the best work of her vocation here, cunningly passing on the drive in Furiosa's spirit in a way that powers the whole film. She accomplishes more with a singing gaze or held jaw than most performers could with a page of discourse. Furthermore, one shouldn't underestimate the strengthening message at the heart of this film—Eve Ensler, creator of 'The Vagina Monologues' counselled with Miller on the script—which proposes that ladies, as the makers of new life, will, intrinsically, dependably be the sexual orientation that holds hardest onto seek after what's to come. Furiosa takes a gander at the craziness of the male initiative around her and chooses that's the last straw. When one of Furiosa's wards starts giving birth and still safeguards herself and her yet-to-be-conceived youngster (subsequent to being shot no less), it's hard not to see 'Fury Road' as a response to the macho jabber that so frequently characterises the activity class. 'FURY ROAD' is the most amazing activity stunt you've found in years, you truly require just hold up a couple of minutes to see something better. This is a film where you continue imagining that its achieved its zenith and afterwards, mysteriously, that minute is abandoned in the tidy. Fury Road' was destined to be sufficiently noteworthy as an unadulterated specialised achievement—a film that chuckles despite blockbuster CGI bashes with a portion of the best altering and sound plan the class has ever observed—but then Miller goes after an option that is more prominent than specialised ability. He holds high up the activity layout that he made with 'The Road Warrior' and contends that Hollywood shouldn't have been replicating it for as long as three decades, they ought to have been expanding on it. 'Fury Road' was a test to an entire era of activity producers, asking them to take after its nervy way into the class' future and, similar to Miller, attempt their hardest to make something new.",8,4,6,22 January 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Mel Gibson Reaches Toward Redemption with a wounding and phenomenally effective Hacksaw Ridge
","Mel Gibson may not generally be a decent executive, but rather he's never a moronic one. His Hacksaw Ridge, is limit and viable, a photo vigilantly made for greatest impact: Whatever nuance it gets originates from its grapple execution by Andrew Garfield, who plays Desmond T. Doss, a genuine World War II trooper who—as a pacifist— declined to convey a weapon however whose boldness spared the lives of no less than 50 men in his unit amid the Battle of Okinawa. What could have pulled in Mel Gibson to the tale of Desmond Doss, a man whose offbeat religious convictions made him an untouchable among his companions, yet who, once the framework had figured out how to grudgingly suit him, functioned ponders and spared souls through sheer drive of conviction? Desmond was a dedicated Seventh Day Adventist and radical who served as a US Army doctor at Okinawa, sparing 75 lives while never lifting a weapon – and the inquisitively perfect subject for what is verifiable and what's going to be seen as Gibson's rebound motion picture. Hacksaw Ridge is an incredibly moving and wounding war film that hits you like a crude topside of hamburger in the face – a sort of essential shaded Guernica that twists on an extra large screen with a group. It is Gibson's first film as a Director since Apocalypto in 2006 – and, all the more appropriately, since a series of embarrassments and open disrespects detoxified his profession in the years that took after. Its account of an untouchable discovering reclamation through superhuman levels of agony is unadulterated Gibson: you could even call it the third part of an informal set of three that likewise takes in Apocalypto and The Passion of the Christ (2004), with the exception of you sense Gibson will return in future to this story over and over, maybe as a result of a profound situated doubt it might likewise be his. It likewise owes a critical obligation to Gallipoli (1981), the Peter Weir First World War epic in which Gibson won his first routine driving man part. In Hacksaw Ridge, that part is taken by Andrew Garfield, an on-screen character who has never struck me as remotely Gibson-like before – however here, his pushed-up hair, foolishly great looking components and nervous physicality sum, intentionally or something else, to a resemblance that is excessively uncanny, making it impossible to disregard. The fundamental distinction is the voice, which Garfield makes high and mindful, nearly Forrest Gump-like. In connection to the hard world around him, Desmond is a man Topsy-turvey – in spite of the fact that the case of his beyond any doubt heart-ed confidence will bit by bit convey others around to his edge. Not that the story was light on religiosity in any case, yet Gibson doesn't spell on Christian imagery, bringing stigmata-like injuries, a drop underneath the earth and a sun-haloed climb to his legend's close to home Passion on the field of fight. War is hell-fire, yet through Hacksaw Ridge, Gibson figures out how to harrow it. There's great power in the blood.",8,3,8,26 January 2017
Donnie Darko," 'Life is one long insane trip. Some people just have better directions.' — Donnie Darko.
","The actual plot of 'Donnie Darko' —During the presidential election of 1988, a teenager named Donnie Darko sleepwalks out of his house one night, and sees a giant, demonic-looking rabbit named Frank, who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. He returns home the next morning to find that a jet engine has crashed through his bedroom.

Alien: Covenant," The 3rd Best 'Alien' MOVIE in the whole 'Alien' MOVIE Franchise. . .
","'I gotta take a leak,' announces one character during a dicey moment when it's probably best not to wander off.'Don't go too far,' says his partner, watching him as he scampers off into the outer-space equivalent of the woods surrounding the cabin in a slasher movie. It's hardly a spoiler to say in the history of scary movies, when someone says they have to go to the bathroom, they rarely just do their business and happily return to the flock.The 'Alien' franchise is something of a chronological Rubik's Cube, in that the movies coming out now predate the movies from the 1970s and 1980s on the fictional time-line.This makes for some on screen techno-anachronisms.Example. Ridley Scott's 'Alien: Covenant' takes place prior to the events of the original 'Alien' (1979), but since it was filmed in the mid-2010s, it's an impressive technical achievement, with amazing CGI special effects plunging us deep into outer space and deep into the future.If you go back and watch 'Alien' (as I did), it's a great movie — but of course it has those late 1970s special effects and production values (and hairstyles), and a nearly 40-year-old vision of what computers and space travel and synthetic robot beings would be like in the year 2122.'Alien: Covenant' is set 10 years after 'Prometheus,' which took place in 2093, so now we're in 2103, about two decades prior to the events of 'Alien,' and if that doesn't mess with your mind, wait until you see the Dueling Fassbenders portion of the current movie.This is the third-best 'Alien' movie, with James Cameron's 'Aliens' as the standard-bearer, and the original (directed by a young Ridley Scott) close behind. There are high-faulting' references to the likes of Byron and Wagner and Shelley — but at its core, 'Covenant' is a glorified monster movie, with some great 'gotcha!' scare moments and, yes, a number of scenes in which a number of supposedly super- smart characters do some really stupid things that get them killed dead-dead-dead.There's only conscious entity aboard Covenant: Walter, a next- generation synthetic who looks exactly like David, which is convenient seeing as how Michael Fassbender plays both synthetics. Everyone else is in the midst of a multi-year cryogenic hyper sleep — but Walter has to awaken the crew when a freak accident plunges the ship into emergency mode.The beloved captain of the ship dies, leaving the by-the-book, self- doubting Oram (Billy Crudup) in command.(Sidebar: It's a bit of a distraction that the quickly-killed-off captain of the Covenant is played by a well-known star. We keep wondering if this character is going to somehow return, because why else would a popular leading man take such a tiny role?)Key crew members aboard the Covenant include the smart and resourceful Daniels (Katherine Waterston), who was married to the late captain; the calm and collected Karine (Carmen Ejogo), who is married to the CURRENT captain (Crudup), and the wisecracking, cowboy-hat-wearing' pilot Tennessee (Danny McBride), who is married to the tough-as-nails Faris (Amy Seimetz).(All of this coupling makes sense, when you consider the goal of the mission is to land on a distant planet and stay there for the duration.)When the Covenant receives a mysterious distress signal, Oram believes it could lead them to a paradise planet even more suited to human life than their original planned destination. Ignoring Daniels' warnings, Oram directs the ship to the mysterious but lush, warm and inviting planet.Of course, there's trouble lurking just around the bend. It's only a matter of time before nasty creatures rear their ugly heads and bare their sharp teeth, and various crew members are dispatched in gruesomely entertaining fashion.Also occupying the planet: none other than David, the synthetic from 'Prometheus,' who tells the crew he's been here for the last 10 years.Enter the Dueling Fassbenders.David becomes a sort of mentor to Walter, even though Walter is the more advanced and sophisticated synthetic. Fassbender's work in these two roles is an understated wonder to behold; he creates two distinct characters that often interact with one another, and he manages to infuse each synthetic creation with unique personality traits.That said, at least one bit of interaction between Walter and David is just goofy and unintentionally funny. And a big plot revelation deep into the story is one of the least surprising 'twists' in recent film history.'Alien: Covenant' includes a number of nods to the first two 'Alien' movies, to the point where it sometimes plays like a Greatest Hits collection. At least they're covering a classic.This is the 3rd Best 'Alien' MOVIE in the whole 'Alien' MOVIE Franchise. . . If nothing else, it's powerful potent performances from Waterston and Fassbender won't disappoint you.",7,15,31,31 May 2017
All the President's Men," Just 'Follow the Money' and see the Most Powerful (Yet Seemingly Fictional) Political Thriller!
","'All the President's Men' may be more historically inaccurate than accurate but it sure details a depth of political corruption at the time seemed unfathomable. Doesn't mean one can actually do less these days though, but when people seem to be genuinely pleased that newspapers are indeed dying, what they are essentially saying is that one of major tools to monitor the proper workings of government is no longer necessary. Thus, corruption can continue unchecked, democracy eroded even further.When I first watched this film, that's over 20 years after it's release. I had no idea about any of the details of Watergate whatsoever. I mean, I was a mare child in some classy school in London.Over 30 years before that was, Richard Nixon, impeached for spying on and sabotaging his political rivals and it all came to light because a handful of burglars got caught breaking into National Democratic Headquarters, which were located in an apartment complex known as 'Watergate'. The story was revealed due to a couple of reporters at the Washington Post, Woodward and Bernstein. That's it, that's all I knew. I didn't even know Woodward and Bernstein's first names. Just the bare minimum (I mean, I think ANY American should know that much, no? But I'm 150% English. With added 50% of USA and rising? that's 200% from both worlds).Here's the thing though. It doesn't matter that you don't know who Bob Haldeman was, you'll figure out enough of what's going on via context, and then the rest of the movie will work its magic on you. By the time the credits roll you'll be saying, that was so awesome, even though you still couldn't tell me what John Ehrlichmans title was at the White House. I've explained the level of complexity in the story as way of illustrating all the challenges this movie overcomes. What winds up happening isn't that the complexity overwhelms the viewer the viewer picks up on the necessary elements and enjoys the movie, while the Watergate-knowledgeable viewer winds up having a film full of details and minutiae to cherish.How do they do it? By focusing on the excitement of it. The adventure. All the President's Men is a thriller, people!! This is the greatest detective story of all time. Woodward and Bernstein were on a quest for the truth, and the truth was being protected by the most powerful people on the planet, with the full force of the government behind them!Woodward and Bernstein slowly come together as a team, and then slowly come to realise exactly what they're dealing with. Their suspicion grows. Evidence mounts.But as the story builds, so does the pressure. The stakes. Other newspapers are racing them to find the truth and to break the story first. People are trying to discredit them. At one point, their editor, Ben Bradlee (portrayed by Jason Robards, who won an Academy Award for this role) tell them, Were under a lot of pressure, you know, and you put us there. Nothings riding on this except the, uh, first amendment to the Constitution, freedom of the press, and maybe the future of the country. Not that any of that matters, but if you guys f*ck up again, Im going to get mad. Goodnight.He wasn't exaggerating, either. Had the Nixon Whitehouse succeeded in blocking their investigation and remained in power, who knows what the consequences would have been for the press. It certainly wouldn't have boded well for the Washington Post, as Nixon most assuredly would have done everything in his power to bring them down.'All the President's Men' is truer to the craft of journalism than to the art of storytelling, and that's its problem. The movie is as accurate about the processes used by investigative reporters as we have any right to expect, and yet process finally overwhelms narrative -- we're adrift in a sea of names, dates, telephone numbers, coincidences, lucky breaks, false leads, dogged footwork, denials, evasions, and sometimes even the truth. Just such thousands of details led up to Watergate and the Nixon resignation, yes, but the movie's more about the details than about their results.That's not to say the movie isn't good at accomplishing what it sets out to do. It provides the most observant study of working journalists we're ever likely to see in a feature film (Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein may at last, merciful God, replace Hildy Johnson and Walter Burns as career models). And it succeeds brilliantly in suggesting the mixture of exhilaration, paranoia, self-doubt, and courage that permeated the Washington Post as its two young reporters went after a presidency.Newspaper movies always used to play up the excitement and ignore the boredom and the waiting. This one is all about the boredom and the waiting and the tireless digging; it depends on what we already know about Watergate to provide a level of excitement. And yet, given the fact that William Goldman's screenplay is almost all dialogue, almost exclusively a series of scenes of people talking (or not talking) to each other, director Alan J. Pakula has done a remarkable job of keeping the pace taut. Does History still repeats itself?",8,2,2,14 June 2017
The Martian," 'In your face, Neil Armstrong!' — The Martian.
","If it's the goal of great science fiction to boldly go where no man has gone before, Sir Ridley's 'The Martian' might be a rare trodden turf, and typically Skeptical of science fiction movies dealing with space travel, yet. While it's no 'Interstellar,' spinning off from Andy Weir's everyone-was-reading-it-on-the-bus bestseller, as much as it is a Robinson-Crusoe-in-space, it's a jet-black comedy about laughing in the face of mortality.This well-crafted film intricately embedded thought-provoking science, real controversial decisions pertaining to space, and futuristic science applications humans have yet to develop.'Mission Control' monitoring, in the movie, the large TV screens plastered in every angle accurately captured the darkness, timing and adrenaline involved in finding a solution within a 3-5 minute span before potential explosions were to cause deaths. 'You do the math. You solve a problem. Then you solve the next. Then you can come home.' Running a mathematical analysis for 560 Sols straight, all by and for a nozzle botanist to stay alive simply on, hey Potatoes! - it takes a skilled team to find real-time solutions.There's a fictitious scene served to brilliantly re-ignite a real concern echoed in the Space community about launch safety. Rocket launches are risky, and successful rocket science is about proper certifications being met. In the movie, the NASA director orders that the return flight's thrust and weight certifications be skipped in order to save time in returning to Mars. His decision led to excessive vibrations and bending moments within the launch, which exploded the rocket into pieces mid-air. This scenario is real. That's almost bloody accurate!Chaos Theory is used for more than space travel. It predicts new technology, new weather systems, and even explains how the human brain's neurons fire together in Neuro-plasticity. Though in travel, humans have never been on a spacecraft that has flown to Mars partly because the 'gravitational assist' effects on the human body are not fully understood yet.Don't forget it's been four decades since Sir Ridley Scott first made space travel so uniquely terrifying with 'Alien;' here, he and Damon fill the film with fresh, deadpan pleasures, storm that kick- starts the narrative, what lingers are the crew's panicked faces, helmets aglow like Chinese lanterns. There is not always much adrenal drama: the default mode is problem- solving. But put The Martian next to its peers and it shines. In particular, between its last-man-standing plot and the presence of both Damon and Jessica Chastain, the overlaps with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar are downright curious. And The Martian is nimble everywhere Nolan's film galumphed; it's a movie in which the greatness of the human spirit meets the wonder of gaffer tape. Furthermore, this must be a new frontier to explore, if 'The Martian' is put in contrast to Britain's spectacular cinema landmarks: 'Moon' to 'Gravity' to 'Interstellar' it'll look like a 70's disco classic remix album: While it is a great science fiction film that intricately embeds thought-provoking science applications humans have yet to develop, you'd hardly call it a Scott 'Masterpiece' stretching itself, or the boundaries of where an effects blockbuster can take us. It's less a space odyssey than this genre's equivalent of a high-climbing log flume that's also very enjoyable to watch.'They say that once you grow crops somewhere, you officially Colonised it. So, technically, I Colonised MARS. In your face, Neil Armstrong!' — Mark Watney a.k.a 'The Martian' a.k.a 'the Greatest Space Pirate—Botanist' to ever step foot on the 'RED Planet: MARS,' and COLONISE it by growing fresh—POTATOES, harvesting his own S%it!",8,1,2,12 July 2017
Atonement," 'Extraordinary' is one such term that utterly goes with this British Cinema finesse
","You know the book. If you use public transport, you'll recognise it as the one everyone was reading circa 2004. There was that Booker Prize shortlisting, the reams of laudatory articles about its author, Ian McEwan. And then arrived the inevitable film adaptation, which should by rights be as stilted and anaemic an affair as most big-screen versions of 'serious' fiction, a (Merchant) ivory tower of self-important emoting from RSC heavyweights. Except that this quality-drenched effort is as stilted as a belly-dancer.The movie's opening act is like a breathless celebration of pure heedless joy, a demonstration of the theory that the pinnacle of human happiness was reached by life in an English country house between the wars. Of course that was more true of those upstairs than downstairs. We meet Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley), the bold, older daughter of an old family, and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), their housekeeper's promising son, who is an Oxford graduate, thanks to the generosity of Cecilia's father. Despite their difference in social class, they are powerfully attracted to each other, and that leads to a charged erotic episode next to a fountain on the house lawn.There's a careful contrast between the gilded youth of Cecilia and friends, literally glowing in Seamus McGarvey's burnished cinematography, Robbie's earthier colours and Briony's cold little face, pinched with self-importance, all setting up a conflict to come.But it's the tone that sets this apart from more traditional, ever-so-slightly-fusty inter-War dramas. Mature actors barely get a look in - near-cameos from Brenda Blethyn, Gina McKee and Vanessa Redgrave aside, no-one over the age of 30 even registers. Magical-realist underwater scenes make the stately home seem an idyll, but the oppressive heat that radiates from the screen hints at tension, sexual and otherwise, bubbling under the surface. The most erotic sex scene in years - this despite the fact that both parties remain almost fully dressed - can't ease the growing dread. Even aside from the World War glowering on the horizon, it's clear that something is about to go horribly wrong.To say much more about the details, however, would be to risk unbalancing a plot as delicately calibrated as clockwork. If you've read the book, you know what's coming. If you haven't, count yourself lucky, and watch with your heart in your mouth as events build to a climax barely halfway through.",10,0,0,14 April 2017
