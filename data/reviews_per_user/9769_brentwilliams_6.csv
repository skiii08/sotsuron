Blade Runner 2049," Sooo boring and forever-taking
","How did this get an 8? I really tried, really wanted to like this. I love almost all sci-fi. But it was so boring. So many still shots of Gosling brooding. They could have shortened it easily by a half hour. Just dragged everything out. I wish it was more exciting. Barely any action. The action it did have was good. Just so hard to get into and pay attention.",1,4,6,7 September 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Worst science fiction movie ever made.
",I watch mostly sci-fi and I've never seen a sci-fi movie I didn't at least kind of like. Until now. This is literally the worst sci-fi movie ever made. It is sooooo boring. Too much time was spent just showing landscapes or a ship landing or Gosling just broodingly staring at the camera. Like get on with it. You could have made it easily a half hour shorter. Not that shorter is better in general but I would have rather wasted 2 hours of my life than 2.5 or whatever it was.,1,3,11,29 January 2020
Hereditary," Awful.
","This is one of the 3 movies in my life I have turned off. I watched about an hour. Like I didn't even care about what happened in that car accident with the little girl because there was absolutely no character development up to that point. No 'attachment' to the characters (or their heads lol). They did a poor job of making the characters seem real or 3-dimensional.
How this boring snoozefest got over a 7 rating is beyond me. Thankfully I learned to turn movies off when I get that feeling before I wasted a second hour of my life.",1,2,5,15 February 2020
Hereditary," I've only turned off 3 movies in my life and this is the 3rd
",Horrid movie. So slow. Just annoying and stupid the whole time. I got about halfway in and turned it off. How can this be rated any highee than a 3 is beyond me. Save yourself 2 hours and don't watch.,1,2,9,7 July 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Terrible terrible movie with outstanding acting.
","I almost turned it off so many times, but I kept thinking to myself that something had to happen. Nothing happened. Many regrets.That acting was great. They did a great job. Especially considering that they had no story to work with and nothing happened.If you want to get bored for two hours, go outside and watch kids play on the streets. That would be more entertaining.If you're going to make a movie about a superhero or someone with super powers, at least make it interesting. If you're going to make a snooze-fest, then don't call it something cool like Birdman insinuating he's gonna fight some bad guys or something fun is going to happen because it didn't.",1,5,10,30 March 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," One of the worst movies ever.
","I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on this piece of crap. Please stay away. I have never given a review bad or otherwise on imdb so please heed my warning.I kept expecting something to happen. The whole movie. But nothing happens. There are some legit stellar performances and outstanding emoting... for nothing. There is no point. (And I don't mean in a Seinfeld kinda way either. )I thought there would at least be some humour to make up for it. But nope. And the ending. Oh your god! Pointless. Supposed to be deep but failed miserably.How? How did it get over 4 stars nevermind 7?! Bunch of Hollywood brainwashed zombies if you asked me. Trust me. If you want to be entertained, stay away!",1,2,5,27 August 2018
