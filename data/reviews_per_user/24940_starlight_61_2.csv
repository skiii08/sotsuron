Casablanca," Bogart at his very best...
","When Hal Wallis and Michael Curtiz paired Humphrey Bogart with Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre...well, that combination in and of itself was sufficient to make the movie a 'box office' smash. However, the year was 1942 and the subject matter and scenario in 'Casablanca' was quite the contemporary issue for that time. No one could know the events that would occur in the following years, as the world waged the brutal battles of World War II. Yet, out of the growing global chaos, Curtiz was able to direct a masterpiece that will continue to rank among the best films ever made. This is classic, quintessential 'Bogey' at his very best. Starring as Rick Blaine, with his sharp, if not, brash style, Bogart gives such life to this character with incredible precision, that he's worthy to be remembered for the classic line 'Here's looking at you kid...'Matched with the stellar performances of the other cast members, this movie will always be an industry standard for it's brilliance and consuming style. If you're a fan of classic films, you must see this one!!",10,2,2,12 February 2003
Citizen Kane," A victory in filmmaking!
","Looking back to 1941 when this film was made, it still amazes me how this film succeeds on so many different levels. It should serve as a tool to those who would think that making a movie is easily accomplished, when it is obvious that to produce a film of this quality it takes a great deal of imagination and effort. This single movie has pushed the boundaries of film making to new limits and opened the door for directors and producers to explore the unlimited possibilities when given the freedom to do so. Citizen Kane is a victory for all who love great movies!!",9,2,4,30 January 2003
