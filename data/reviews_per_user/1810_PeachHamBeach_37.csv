Alien 3," Good on many levels, but not the best of the ALIEN films.
","WARNING: DEFINITE SPOILERS.ALIEN 3 is a great example of how too much meddling ruins a promising movie. This movie went thru so many re-writes and director changes it's a wonder it ever got made at all. 20th Century Fox meddled until their meddlers got sore. I can't believe someone thought a wooden planet full of monks was plausible. Luckily, this was changed into a max security prison filled with 'YY' men, rapists, pedophiles, sociopaths, serial killers, you name it. Ripley and the survivors from ALIENS are in hypersleep when a fire breaks out aboard the Sulaco, and the escape lifeboat is jettisoned and crash lands on Fiorina 161, the prison planet.One of the problems I had with this film is the fact that since everyone's head is shaved, and almost everyone is British, I had trouble differentiating one character from another. There weren't enough closeups, so many of them simply looked too 'alike' for me to get to know characters. Yet everyone did a marvelous job acting, and characters such as Warden Andrews (Brian Glover), Golic (Paul McGann), and Mr. Aaron (Ralph Brown), AKA '85' were amusing as they tried to deal with Ripley's presence in their orderly world. Charles S. Dutton gives a great performance as Dillon, the 'leader' of these prisoners, who are trying to live lives of order, atonement, and godliness after committing such heinous crimes. The other problem I had is: how did 2 eggs get aboard the escape pod? How??? Did Queen Bitch lay them before her last attempt to kill Ripley, Newt and Bishop??? If you've seen the film, you know what happened with egg #1, but in the theatrical version, victim #2 is a dog, and in the 'Assembly Edition,' an ox.Weaver of course is still as commanding as ever, and got an Oscar nom for this portrayal of Ripley. Not because she shaved her head either, but because she gave us even more layers. For the very reasons I was angry about the beginning of the film (the deaths of Hicks and Newt), we got to see a Ripley who has lost so much. She had developed a very deep relationship with Newt, which would have balmed the pain of losing her own daughter (outliving her due to 57 years of hypersleep drifting in space), and she had had an undeniable chemistry and friendship with Hicks as well. She's lost everyone now, and she's not even afforded more than a few hours of closeness with Clemens (Charles Dance) the prison's chief medical officer. I enjoyed the 'Assembly Edition' so much more than the original cut. There was a much better look at the individual characters. Even though the ox was a clumsier animal than a Rottweiler to use as the unlikely host to a chestbuster, it was interesting to me. Having an alien more 'doglike' than humanoid was very interesting as a twist. I also liked the addition of Junior (Holt McCallany, an actor I've liked since seeing him on CSI Miami) attempting to redeem himself after that horrible scene of Ripley nearly being raped. Another standout is Danny Webb as Morse, who after being hateful to Ripley for bringing lots of problems, one in particular, with her when she crashed, ends up a hero.Again, not my favorite, but as long as the 'Assembly Ed.) exists, it has its merits, and once you get used to the disappointing beginning, it's quite a good story with great acting.",7,4,4,21 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not so bad, gets better the more you watch it
","I give this flick an 8 mainly because of Jar-Jar. I don't want to be ultra hateful, but I think this is the only creature Lucas created that is close to insufferable. He's silly without being funny and amounts to barely more than a few wasted pixels and almost every scene could have been left on the editor's floor. He has one or two redeeming milliseconds during the ground battles on Naboo with the droids of the Federation, but it's too little too late. They could have brought back Chewbacca and had him fighting, since he apparently has a long lifespan. At least Chewie doesn't say stupid things in some Afro-Jamaican/Creole accent.Moving along, THE PHANTOM MENACE, while nowhere near the classic status of the old trilogy, is a movie that I've found much more enjoyable once the complex political plot lines are understood. This is probably the most politically charged film in the saga, where rapid changes incur constantly. First there is greed over taxes and trades, then threats of starvation, political lies and manipulations, double identities, darker motives disguised as simple greed for more money, and as religiously as politically, the rise of a power in the Force whose training resembles the great Jedi, yet use their power for the Dark Side.Even the performances of certain actors don't seem as bad to me six years later. I may have had certain expectations and was just being unfair. I had a problem with Jake Lloyd at first. I thought Anakin should have been even older than nine when he is discovered. Anakin seemed to be a character geared toward drawing children in to Star Wars. He seemed too sweet-natured and had dialogue that was irritating when all you wanted was to watch him blow up the Federation battleship. Now I don't feel as nitpicky about it. Nobody in the film can match Jar-Jar for ability to annoy anyway. To boot, Lloyd even has many impressive moments, and given his age, he deserves some praise for what he brought to the saga.Years ago, it seemed to me that Natalie Portman's performance was boring and stilted, but when I watch it now, it's great. Her Queen Amidala/Padme is intelligent, courageous and a natural leader. Sometimes the very beautiful makeup and costumery appear to drag her down physically, but her dialogue during the disputes with the Federation and the Senate is strong, and the strange elegant accent the Queen speaks in only add to the mystery and uniqueness of the character.The plot is simply this: The Sith and the Trade Federation are in league to gain power over the galaxy. They tax unfairly and threaten to stop commerce with certain planets who don't wish to let the Federation get away with greed. The Sith are at first unknown to be behind the scheme, but when the Chancellor Valorum sends 2 Jedi to investigate the ViceRoy of the Federation, a Sith named Darth Sidious tries to have the Jedi disposed of. The Jedi Knights, Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and the young padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) escape and go to Naboo to warn the young Queen of the intentions of the Federation to come arrest her and force her to sign a treaty giving the Federation power over her planet. In a battle, the hyperdrive of her ship is damaged and they are forced to land on the desert plantet Tattooine. The Queen sends her servant Padme along with the Jedi to find a parts dealer. There, as fate, luck, or the will of the Force would have it, they cross paths with a little slave boy and his mother, who basically did the same thing as Mary, the mother of Christ. Qui-Gon Jinn is touched by the boy's generous selfless nature and does a special blood test that reveals that the Force's power is strong in the little boy. Perhaps his admiration for the boy's goodness clouds his judgement. Qui-Gon, while a good and skillful Jedi, is not held in the same high regard as Knights like Master Yoda or Mace Windu. His plans to train Anakin Skywalker are met with disapproval by the Jedi Council, and he defies their recommendations. Yoda senses a lot of fear in the child, simply because Anakin is worried about his mother, Shmi (Pernilla August) remaining behind in slavery. I don't think it's so wrong for a child to love and worry about his mother, but it could be that even this kind of fear is a trait that leads to Darkness.The heavy politics come about when Queen Amidala is set before the Republic to bring accusations of abuse of power against the Federation and the Viceroy. Senator Palpatine convinces Amidala to vote Chancellor Valorum out of office in favor of a stronger executive. I still do not know why Palpatine was able to influence such a decision, as Valorum was 'our strongest supporter against the Federation'. It was Valorum who sent the Jedi to confront the Viceroy. Still, Palpatine gets his way, and becomes the replacement Chancellor, promising to solve everyone's problems. We all know, of course, he is Darth Sidious, the founder of the evil Sith. He already has an accomplice/apprentice, Darth Maul, who was sent to Tatooine to kill the Jedi Knights and capture the Queen.If you watch this film and forget about how much you loved the old trilogy, you will have less of a problem paying attention to its complex plot, which is a really good one that establishes the origins of the famed Galactic Empire. It all started with greed and lust for power. Nothing will ever take the old movies' place in my heart, but I have respect for the new movies and appreciate George Lucas for getting them made so that we could have the whole interesting story.",8,1,4,16 May 2005
Star Trek," It took a while to warm up to it, but...
","It's official. I like it. I'll give it an A- or 8/10 stars. I was proper mad when I found out they were going to rearrange the time-honored timeline...destroy planet Vulcan?! Kill off Spock's beloved human mother?! Have Uhura be Spock's girlfriend?! BEWARE: MAJOR SPOILERS!!!!!Now I know what to do. Whenever I decide to have a Trek-a-thon of movies and shows, I'll watch the old stuff first, chronologically...Enterprise, TOS, TAS, and the first 6 films with the TOS cast. From there, I'll choose to either watch the Next Gen and its films, followed by DS9 and Voyager, or I'll insert these 2 JJ Abrams movies in right after THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY. Either way, all it is is an alternate timeline, alternate reality. In the future, Spock gets on the bad side of a 'very disturbed Romulan' named Nero. Older Spock (Leonard Nimoy yay! :D ) ends up going back to the date of Kirk's birth where he witnesses Nero completely rearrange the original reality. Kirk's Dad is supposed to have lived to see his son's accomplishments in StarFleet, but instead he is killed just moments after baby Jim is born. In the new reality, Spock is the designer of the Kobayashi Maru test. (In THE WRATH OF KHAN, the dying Spock declares, 'I never took the KM...what do you think of my solution?') In the new reality, we have a troubled, immature Kirk whose Dad was never in his life instead of the Kirk we're accustomed to. A little 'Tom Cruise-ism' has been liberally applied. How many times has the Tomster played arrogant, childish twirps who have to overcome something and live up to Daddy's legacy? Even the APPLE during the simulation of the Kobayashi Maru...remember A FEW GOOD MEN????!!! LOLSure, I gripe. But I'm not a purist. I ended up really liking this new film in spite of being sure I'd hate it. Chris Pine's Kirk grows up fast, thank God, and becomes much more likable as the film progresses. Zachary Quinto (Is it KEEN-TO? Or QUINN-TO? Sorry if I've butchered it before!) makes a wonderful Spock, and has great chemistry with Pine. Both of them pay great homage to Shatner and Nimoy, and even though I didn't see it before, Pine has been able to channel Shatner's vibe. I'm on the Spirk bandwagon too. Now whenever I look at pictures of Pine and Quinto or the young Shatner and Nimoy, one word comes to mind: T'hy'la...Soul Mate :) Surely I'm not alone in believing that by the 23rd century, the New Civil Rights battle will have been resolved, and people will be evolved enough to accept same-sex relationships. One can hope!I adore the new Bones (Karl Urban) and the new Sulu (John Cho) is very cool. The new Chekov is wonderful too...Anton Yelchin is one of the best actors out there...perfect choice! I'm sorry...I have no issue with Zoe Saldana, but the new Uhura was really dull compared with the original, and I'm not just saying that because a pairing between her and Spock is not only illogical but BORING! And speaking of boring, they really have gall when they say Nero was a better villain than Kruge, or Shinzon, or Ruafo, or Tolian Soran. Nero is BORING. The only thing that kept him afloat as a villain were the horrifying special effects (black hole eating Vulcan) and that huge, ugly ship of his! 'It did happen! Don't tell me it didn't happen! I saw it happen! Don't tell me it didn't happen!' Oh puh-leeze! Nero is THE most forgettable villain.Still sounds like I hated it? Nope, not even with the terribly borrowed concept of 'parasitic creature who will make you talk!' Ripped right from WRATH OF KHAN. The story overall is very engaging (even when Kirk is ejected from the Enterprise and ends up on 'Hoth' with the same crab creature who terrorized Anakin and Padme in ATTACK OF THE CLONES! LOL) and most of the cast are really great and give enthusiastic performances, including Bruce Greenwood as Capt. Pike. At the conclusion of this first foray into a new timeline, Kirk and Spock will begin their long friendship (and t'hy'la-ship too, if only in my imagination!) aboard the Enterprise. I am already 99.9999% sure I'll love Benedict Cumberbatch in the sequel to this film. Whether or not I love the film INTO DARKNESS remains to be seen. But I probably will. In spite of the dozens of complaints I've made about this prequel, I enjoy the crap out of it!!!",8,0,0,5 August 2013
Alien: Resurrection," As a standalone, fun & surprising, as a part of the ALIEN legacy, kind of silly!!!
","PLEASE, BE SMART. IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS FILM AND DON'T WANT SPOILERS, DON'T READ THIS REVIEW!!!!!!!!! ALIEN: scifi, drama, horror, with a first-rate cast and very spare dry comic relief. ALIENS: scifi,action, horror, with a VERY likable cast, and some fitting comic hysteria from Bill Paxton. ALIEN 3: scifi, drama, horror, a very gifted first time director, and again, very spare comedy, almost no comedy at all, and acting wise, surprising for all of its other disappointments.ALIEN: RESURRECTION...hmmmm...as a standalone movie, this is kind of a treat as a scifi, horror, camp-comedy. Some pluses: Like ALIENS, it has a lot of action and gunplay, and like ALIENS, it has human villains and hordes of vicious aliens. And I LOVE John Frizzell's score. Completely awesome, evoking horror and suspense. The only score I like better is Jerry Goldsmith's from ALIEN. The cast is pretty good, though I thought a few characters were pointless.As a member of the ALIEN franchise...perhaps not so much. Minuses: I hated Michael Wincott's sleazy and uninteresting Elgyn and was happy to see him offed early. Kim Flowers' Hillard was pointless as well. Ron Perlman's Johner was insufferable in his character and dialogue: 'So Ripley, I heard you, like, ran into these things before...So, like, what did you do?' Winona Ryder. As with Ash, there is a big 'reveal' scene with Call. But she absolutely has no place in this kind of film. Why would an android complain about being 'disgusting'? Just no. Pluses: I liked Dominique Pinon's Vriess most of the time. I liked Gary Dourdan's Christie, but he was one character whose death was not only too damn early in the film, but totally ridiculous. Was it a suicide to save Vriess' life? Or did an alien grab him once he hit the water and take him under and kill him? Hitting the water from a ladder is not instant death, but the way Vriess was wailing, 'Don't do it, Christie!' you would swear it was! More pluses: Brad Douriff played the 2nd most evil scientist I have ever seen in history. J. E. Freeman narrowly exceeds him. This movie is a great scifi illustration of pure instinct vs. pure evil, and Wren is one evil bird. I have always seen the alien xenomorphs as instinctual creatures, not evil ones. Like lions, tigers and bears, they will kill you, but it's not because they are evil, it's because that is what they are hardwired to do, by God, by nature, by evolution, or whatever. Douriff, Freeman and their cronies? Evil as hell. The unholy glee with which these people watch the facehuggers attacking a crew up KIDNAPPED men is very sickening. So, see below...Big minus: It was bad enough to realize the scientists are evil, no doubt seeking to build an alien army that would strike fear in the hearts of anyone opposing some fascist government somewhere. For this same reason, it was hard to really empathize with any of the pirate crew. The humans are the more evil of the villains. Big plus: The aliens are only animals...at least until now. Sigourney Weaver delivers again, though I'm not sure why anyone felt this film had to be made. Maybe because ALIEN 3 was so dark and ultimately depressing. And most certainly, it's preposterous to think the evil scientists could clone an ALIEN queen, as well as a Ripley, but she is great fun nevertheless. Anyway, this ain't the Ripley who died. In their evil experiment, the scientists created a Ripley who has lots and lots of alien DNA in her. In short, she is an alien who is physically a lot more strong, and mentally, a lot less kind-hearted, than her deceased human ancestor. She has just enough of the real Ripley in her to almost remember Newt, but otherwise, she grins instead of frowning when the evil scientists horribly overestimate their ability to 'tame' and to 'train' the aliens, and horribly underestimate the aliens' endless capacity for ingenuity. Because these aliens are also descendants of a human being, Ripley, they are 'smarter,' and not above killing one of their own and using it as a means of escaping their cells. Of course, the alien in ALIEN and the aliens in ALIENS were descended from humans as well.Ripley 8 is like the aliens, half innocent predatory animal, half intelligent and kind of evil human. She only begins to realize how awful those scientists are when she meets her seven 'sisters' in the medical lab, how they heartlessly keep one clone alive with tubes and machines. Ripley 8 only begins to become our hero yet again when she decides she must not let her 'children' live to destroy everyone on pitiful earth, which looks like it's been thru a few nuclear holocausts lately.I see I am really Over-analyzing this movie. It's great to see the evil Wren get his ultimate reward from one of his victims. It's also great to see the other evil scientists end up in cocoons, but wait! The Queen that they created along with Ripley 8, the OTHER mama to the fearsome xenomorphs evolves from having an insect reproductive system to a human one! No more egg-laying!!! What?! Yes, Queenie now has a uterus!!! She's having another baby!!! What a busy Mom!!! And the only thing freakier than the Newborn itself is Douriff's delirious and hilarious verbal cooing, 'Beautiful, beautiful little baby!!!' That newborn is the stuff of night and daymares, be warned!!! Strangely enough, many, including myself, feel a little sad (as well as VERY repulsed) by the newborn's death sequence.4 out of 10 .",4,0,0,22 December 2014
The Impossible," tortuously beautiful
",Amazing film about the horrific tsunami that struck the countries in the Indian Ocean region and killed hundreds of thousands. The movie becomes tortuously suspenseful in the middle and towards the end when the husband searches doggedly for his wife and oldest son and the wife fights for her life after being severely injured.The acting is impeccable (especially from Naomi Watts) but even more astounding is the cinematography and scenes of Watts and the oldest son Lucas fighting against the vicious flow of the killer wave. The scenes of their bodies being battered and pummeled by debris underwater...almost more than I could stand.,10,1,3,23 May 2013
The Notebook," Wow, I was surprised!!!
","Back when THE NOTEBOOK was just a book written by author Nicholas Sparks (I almost always get him confused with Nicholas Evans)I heard critics saying things. They weren't really mean. They weren't even snarky. They were kind of playfully saying that Sparks and his work were 'unabashedly sentimental'. I tuned into the movie starring Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner and Gena Rowlands last night, expecting a mediocre, and very sentimental romantic drama full of hearts and flowers and moosh.Boy I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film!!! It was very romantic, full of sentiment and sweetness, but it wasn't full of fake mooshy slobbery sentiment. It felt real. Even the end, which I won't reveal, in all its heavy emotion and absolution, felt real, not overly sentimental. I'm certain some felt it was trying to paint a picture of flawless, perfect love, but in fact, their love and relationship was flawed and in need of nurturing just like anyone elses'.The performances of Gosling and McAdams as the young 1940s couple were terrific, but the heart and soul of the film are Garner and Rowlands as a present day pair of friends in a nursing home for people with Altzheimers. All the heartbreak of this affliction and how it destroys memories was compelling. The real meaning of love and commitment in married life and how you stay with your mate through good times and horrible times was beautifully realized here, as one party reads to another from a sacred story notebook in hopes of resurrecting precious memories, even if the disease snatches them back over and over.I plan to read the book soon. Sometimes sentimentality is good.",10,0,2,14 April 2006
The Terminator," Review of the Special Edition DVD
","I've reviewed this classic movie before, but now I'm gonna review the DVD. To start, I must say that although they had their rationale for deleting the 'terminated' scenes, as they were called, I think they definitely should have left that one scene in where Sarah Connor calls her mom and tells her to hide in the cabin, and where she finds the listing of Cyberdyne Corp. in the phone book. This scene established Sarah as one who is willing to try to take matters into her hands to stop a nuclear war and a horrible future. She talks to Reese about getting rid of Cyberdyne and they get into an arguement about whether or not that is a mission objective and Reese ends up chasing Sarah into a wooded area. I think the beauty of the woods, flowers and waterfalls was important too, because Reese starts crying and saying how all of this is destroyed, and the future is nothing but blackened, charred ruins littered with the skulls of attempted human genocide. What a terrific, powerful scene. I adore Michael Biehn, and I didn't realize what a great actor (and crier) he is!!! Maybe the other 'terminated' scenes were okay to delete, although they were all delightful. The one where Sarah practices her 'wholesome waitress' routine was cute. The one where she talks about Disneyland and hot dogs might have seemed silly, but it really brought home how foreign our world is to Reese, as did the crying scene. The tickling scene might have seemed silly to the editor, but I thought it really made a point: after all the violence and bleakness Reese lived through, to be with the woman he's always loved and idolized, to lay in a cozy warm bed with her experiencing the simple joys of life for the first time (I still wonder if Sarah devirginized him, since he said he'd 'never' had any special someone in his life) seemed to bring everything into perspective. The scene where you discover that the factory was Cyberdyne Systems was important too, but I'll let these scenes slide. I really think they should consider releasing a TERMINATOR with the scene in the wooded area included. Nevertheless, I still consider this film as one of my favorite sci-fi films, and my favorite James Cameron film. I still admire who he infuses humanity with action and adrenaline, and the missing scenes were wonderful.",10,64,85,19 April 2003
The Terminator," Violent, Gory, Metallic, Raw and Surprisingly Touching and Humanistic
","Although I loved TITANIC as much as anyone,  THE TERMINATOR is my favorite James Cameron movie.  It was raw,  gritty,  violent and although it has its own technological wonders,  they are far fewer than the ones in Cameron's newer movies,  and I liked the lack of frills.  This story about a woman running for her life from a futuristic cyborg programmed to assassinate her is more human than technological.  I hope that Cameron never loses that quality because I've always admired it and noticed it in every one of his films from THE TERMINATOR to ALIENS to THE ABYSS to T2 to TITANIC.  There's lots of special effects,  but he never fails to breathe life into his human characters.  I am like a lot of people,  I really like Michael Biehn and every movie I've ever seen with him in it.  He never gets the kind of attention he deserves,  and this early role of Kyle Reese,  the human soldier who risked ultimately everything to travel over time to help protect Sarah Connor,  was the first nuanced hint of his amazing talent and is still my favorite role of his.  And I'm certainly glad I'm not strange for thinking that the brief love affair that the two had was a touching and fitting though very surprising ingredient to the story.  To me, the talk that they have about the bleakness and pain that Reese knows is in the future and the sudden and unexpected discovery of their love is making a subtle,  yet profound statement,  like saying hope in the stead of hopelessness,  life in the place of lifelessness,  and joy and love in the place of hate and violence and pain. Okay,  I'm corny,  but this movie really did leave me with the corniness you read.  And last but not least,  Arnold Schwarzenegger as the huge,  ammoral killer,  a real treat,  the icing on the cake,  and my favorite lines: 'Twelve guage auto loadah...Phase plasma rifle with a forty watt range...uzi nine millimetah!!!'  : )",10,0,0,20 October 1999
Alien," Suddenly became tied with 'The Thing' as my fave sci-fi/horror!
","As a younger kid, it was ALIENS rather than ALIEN, and though I still love Cameron's ALIENS and its balls to the wall constant action and acid-shed, I have very recently come to love the subtle power that is the first ALIEN. I must first say that much of this adoration comes from the beautifully sinister score by Mr. Goldsmith, and, as I very recently learned, a piece from 'Romance' by Howard Hanson. This became Ripley's theme of defeating the Alien at the end of the film. But I also love Sigourney Weaver, who will always be Ripley. If they dare to remake this film, I won't go see it. We need to learn to quit 'needing' to remake everything and accept the classics as they are, products of their time. I am sick to death of CGI. This film is a real classic, directed by the innovative Ridley Scott, and its cast includes Tom Skerrit as the temperamental and not-so- sensible Capt. Dallas, John Hurt as the tragic Kane, Veronica Cartwright as yes, the weepy but understandably terrified Lambert, Harry Dean Stanton as Brett, a mechanic of few words, Ian Holm as Ash, the science officer, the incomparable Yaphet Kotto as Parker, who was somewhat of a comic relief for a while here, and then went on to an amazing dramatic career, and last but not least, Jonesy (I'm a cat lover, OK?)The story is simple...a space 'towtruck' called the Nostromo is 'lured' by a signal to a small planet to investigate. They wouldn't bother. They are only a commercial civilian vessel after all, but their employers have ordered them to investigate via 'Mother' their ship's computer. You know the rest, or if you don't, you need to watch this peerless film. Then follow it up with ALIENS. After, you could check out the impeccably acted but disappointing ALIEN 3 (mainly due to the fact that they killed off Michael Biehn! Rackin Frackin critters at 20th Century Fox!!!), and if you have an hour or so to waste, ALIEN: RESURRECTION.",10,2,4,16 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not nearly as awful as many think, but there ARE some glaring faults!!!
","First of all, Hayden Christensen rocks, y'all!!! If Lucas had picked Ryan Phillipe instead, it would not have worked. Jonathan Jackson??? I forget who else. Thank God they didn't get picked!!! Hayden embodies what Anakin is all about. He's damn gorgeous first and foremost, and his first very dark moment is superbly acted!!! Bad acting, overacting, bah!!! Whoever says this stuff doesn't know what they're talking about, either that or the actor they were voting for didn't get this iconic role. Either way, Anakin's anguish and rage and hate are evident when he murders the Sand-People and then when he confesses everything to Padme. 'They're animals and I slaughtered them like animals!!! I hate them!!!' God, what do people want???!!! I was fully aware of the 'quick, easy' path of the Dark Side when I saw this!!! Hayden Christensen IS Anakin Skywalker, and his performance is one of the high points of this less than perfect installment of Star Wars.The other great things??? There really are quite a few. The love story is convincing. Maybe people will always remember Han and Leia as having the most memorable love story, but Anakin is not a cocky anti-hero and Padme is not a smart-alecky orphaned princess. Every character, new and old, has their own personality. What did people want??? A lot of groping and smooching??? I wasn't all that offended by some of the 'hokey' love lines between the two. They teased each other, talked a lot about their roles in life, and eventually fell in love. There was probably a lot of love there even when Anakin was only 9 and Padme was but 14. Anyway, the romance element was just fine. I believed the two loved each other, so the purpose was served.Big faults: Way too much CGI. The chase of the changeling on Coruscant was good. The attempted executions using clawed and fanged beasts wasn't too bad, but so many cartoon characters!!! The slobby friend of Obi-Wan's who worked in a diner. The Kaminoans. The Genesoans. The droids that fought the Jedi and the clones. Heavens to betsy, there is such a thing as overkill. Luckily, the CGI didn't overwhelm the story as badly as it could have. The pacing is more confusing than PHANTOM MENACE I should also point out. The end was confusing. And maybe that was intentional...are the clones really to help the Jedi and the Republic, or were they made especially for the Separatist movement and the Sith??? While AOTC is not the best of the new STAR WARS trilogy (I think REVENGE OF THE SITH will definitely take that title) the harsh criticism it has gotten isn't deserved.I DO think ATTACK OF THE CLONES wasn't a good title. It should have been simply THE CLONE WARS BEGIN or something.",7,0,1,14 May 2005
Forrest Gump," Portrait of INNOCENCE in its purest form...
","I have an 8 year old sister who is autistic. She is pure innocence.
MIGHT BE SPOILERS...So is FORREST GUMP. Yes, he is present at history's most renowned events: the manifestation of young Elvis Presley,  the integration of the University of Alabama, the War in Vietnam and all the controversy surrounding it, Watergate, and the shootings/assasinations of various famous politicians, among the many. But his presence at these events is purely coincidental.
Forrest Gump is born to a single woman, and although we never really find out WHY he is like he is, it's pretty evident that he was born with some degree of brain damage. He's not retarded, but he is very slow, very naive, and again, very innocent. Perhaps he is an alcohol syndrome baby. His natural father is gone and nobody knows where or why. Maybe he has a degree of autism from immunizations gone bad or something.Point is, Forrest Gump is NOT STUPID. One person said this film celebrates stupidity and ignorance. I see neither stupidity nor ignorance in this character. What I see I've already listed above.He loves his mama and looks to her for answers and wisdom. He believes in her. She has always been there for him and with him.  He loves his friend Jenny, who has been sexually molested by her father and is obviously flighty and troubled. Forrest's love for her follows her all over the nation, from a strip club in Tennessee, to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury hippie scene, to the cocaine-laden disco clubs of NYC in the late '70s.
As if to prove to people that purity is a good thing, even if it's because of brain damage, God showers good fortune on Forrest Gump in the form of a prosperous shrimp company. His friend Lt. Dan, having been crippled during the War, shares the wealth with him. And finally, even though it's really too late and she had her own reasons, Forrest gets to marry his Jenny.And at least he has Little Forrest to devote his pure life to.One of my favorite movies!!!",9,0,2,28 August 2003
Gone Baby Gone," Superb thriller!
","I don't know a whole lot about how well this movie did in fests, at box offices or with the awards ceremonies...have to look that up soon. All I know is, Ben Affleck ought to be given lots of awards for this. It is an outstanding drama and a nail biting thriller. A superb cast including Casey Affleck, Titus Welliver, Ed Harris, and Morgan Freeman (who is incapable of anything less than perfect acting) about the abduction of a tot in Beantown, and how members of her family hire 2 private investigators to 'augment' the search, GONE BABY GONE should seal Ben Affleck's talent and credibility once and for all.There is not much negative I can say about it. The only problem I had was a few too many F words every other sentence at first, but after some time, it toned down a bit. It wasn't any worse than GOOD WILL HUNTING, and the Southie of Boston is not a sweet, cuddly neighborhood.The plot is as twisty and complex as any high quality thriller you can compare it to, including one of my recent 'brilliant but cancelled' TV series, KIDNAPPED. The acting, writing and cinematography are top quality. Casey Affleck gives a wonderful performance as the main character from whose viewpoint the story is given.The ending is not easy to watch, resulting from a dilemma about morals and ethics. You feel angry, but you're not sure who to be angry at, and you're not sure if there was any way for the story to come out well from all angles. The ending is another reason this film is excellent. Nothing is force fed to you, and you make your own decision whether things should have been done the way Patrick did them.I'll give it an A+.",10,0,0,8 April 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," Far exceeded my expectations
","I don't think I'm prejudiced for Chris Evans, because I will admit right out that I wasn't very fond of the 2nd FANTASTIC FOUR movie, and I wasn't too impressed with THE PERFECT SCORE or the LOSERS either, although I like all the actors in all the movies. I figured THE FIRST AVENGER was going to be really bland, a weak story hidden behind spectacular visuals and costumery and set design. But it turned out to be wonderful. Perhaps it's because I love Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee Jones so much. A movie is made a million times better with them involved. Set during WWII, CAPTAIN America, is rife with patriotism and American pride and idealism. One young man, undersized Steve Rogers (Evans) feels cheated out of being able to serve his country because of his fragile appearance and multiple health issues. After attempting several times to be selected, he is approached by Dr. Erskine (Tucci) who is working with the army to build supersoldiers with a special serum. That's all. Watch the movie if you haven't yet. I enjoy it because it has a strong story, good pace, and memorable characters who are fleshed out. I didn't like THE GREEN LANTERN or THE HULK. I'm not a comic book connoisseur. But this one was very enjoyable for me.",8,0,2,26 August 2012
The Thing," Still my all time favorite sci-fi/horror!!!
","The silly saying, 'You can't touch this' surely applies here. With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood 'jumping' out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.",10,37,42,22 May 2008
Cold Mountain," Flawed but good war epic
","SPOILERS POSSIBLEFirst let me get my gripes out of the way: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, whose work I usually admire, was purely IRRITATING in this movie!!! I don't know why his comic relief didn't work for me, but it just didn't. Talking about having to take a dump, rambling on about his curly hair, and above all, his appetite for sex, which shouldn't be surprising, being that he's a 'man of God'. Still, it was just bad, really bad!!!Gripe #2, the ending was just a wee bit melodramatic, but I can forgive that. The music is absolutely beautiful, the instrumental theme and the songs by Allison Krauss. The score should have won an Oscar. The cast, aside from Hoffman, was terrific. Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renee Zellweger (a great performance as a toughened farm girl), Brendan Gleeson, Jack White, Kathy Baker, Giovanni Ribisi, Natalie Portman, Ethan Suplee, and Eileen Atkins (as a somewhat scary old woman living in the woods), all were wonderful. In spite of what a lot of reviewers said, I found the pace somewhat fast and easy to follow. The story kept me engaged. It only took a big blundering trip and fell down when Hoffman appeared on the scene. Thank God his irritating character was killed off relatively fast. While Inman is trying to find his way home to Cold Mountain, Ada is learning how to run her farm, and learning to be tougher than the Southern Belle she was in the beginning.Lots of action, romance and wonderful characters. I give this movie an A- or a B+.",Null,0,0,12 October 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not bad for a second sequel
","This is the third chapter of the TERMINATOR franchise, and it's pretty good with its more modern (the first and second films were made before most of us began making the internet a part of our everyday lives) knowledge and post 9/11 viewpoints.John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now about 25 (?) years old. Sarah Connor has passed away from leukemia and John is sort of drifting through life, just waiting it seems, for the next assassin to cross time and try to end him before the nuclear holocaust takes place.Enter the TX aka the Terminatrix (kind of silly, don't you think? Just because Kristanna Loken's a sexy vixen type?) who is quite well played by the actress, who obviously studied Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick in the preceding films. Like the T1000 in the second film, TX is a liquid polymer advancement on the original 101 (again, Good Arnold).The film is mostly about how TX begins to kill off future soldiers for the Resistance Movement. She succeeds for the most part, but she can't seem to get to John or his friend Kate Brewster (Claire Danes). While being chased by TX, John, Kate and 101 will find out more about Skynet, and the role Kate's father will play.Though it's a good storyline, this third film doesn't seem as 'fun' as the first two, in spite of the stunts, effects, costumes and everything. It just doesn't feel the same. Though Stahl does a good job acting, his John Connor ought to have been much more vigilant by this point, and he seemed to think that just because Judgement Day didn't come in 1997, he was in the clear.",7,0,0,22 April 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A good sequel is a rarity...
","True, T2 is much more up to date special effects wise (one of the first films to use CGI instead of head puppets or anamatronics or stop-motion), but that's not the reason I like this sequel. There are lots of reasons. Among them: Robert Patrick's delicately featured T1000 comes across as almost scarier and more ruthless than the original Series 101 (Arnold's role reprised, sort of...he's GOOD in this sequel), more screen time for Earl Boen as Dr. Silberman, and of course, Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.Sarah, in the years since learning about the future, and giving birth to her son John (Edward Furlong, whose performance I appreciate much more than I used to, in spite of the sometimes annoying 'chill out dickwad' stuff), has been using all her energy training and preparing John, always on the road and on the run. When she tries to blow up a software factory, she is arrested, declared insane, and stuck in an institution run by Silberman.I always appreciate a Cameron film restored to its original length, and really enjoyed a scene with Sarah getting a visit from the late Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn :) who implores her to find a way to escape the hospital and find and protect John, who has been in the foster care system. Her suspicions that Skynet has sent another assassin are true, but like before, a protector has also been sent.Before long, Sarah, John and the 101 are on the lam, and learn a great deal about a man named Dyson (Joe Morton) who will play a very huge part in the advancement of Cyberdyne Systems and Skynet.Like Roddenberry, Jim Cameron is a prophet of sorts. In 1991, most of us little people barely knew anything about the internet. The next chapter of the story, RISE OF THE MACHINES, will further explain what Kyle Reese was raving about in the 1984 film.I still like the original TERMINATOR better than its successors, but T2 is a film I've come to appreciate a lot more...restored footage always helps and I wish filmmakers would just stop cutting scenes out. Who cares about theatres? If a DVD movie is 4 hours plus, a person can turn it off and come back to it later.",9,2,2,22 April 2011
Aliens," Megatons of FUN
","LOTS OF SPOILERS. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM, DON'T READ THE REVIEW!!!This is many peoples' fave of the ALIEN franchise, and with good reason. It has a deepening of Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) character (if you watch the version with lots of restored footage), more info about the girl Newt (Carrie Henn) and how she came to be orphaned and a lone survivor of a colony of over 100 people called Hadley's Hope, and lots of great characters. The prequel to this film had a pretty small cast and felt claustrophobic at times, but ALIENS seems to move more briskly, even though it's set on the same planet.Boy, Weland-Yutani must be the epitome of evil, greedy, petty corporations. Nearly 6 decades after Ripley and Jonesy went into stasis after destroying the first Alien, this bunch of bureaucratic turds are STILL mad that she blew up the Nostromo. The oh-so-generous jerks decline to press criminal charges against her, but they revoke her license so that she has to start her life over again working at a crappy new job. Barely back on earth for a few weeks or so, she gets a knock on her door from one Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser, before MAD ABOUT YOU) and an inexperienced Lt. Gorman (William Hope), who leads a corps of Marines. They practically beg Ripley to accompany them to the planet LV426 because suddenly the terraforming colony overseen by Weland-Yutani Corp. has not been heard from in a while and nobody can raise them. Suddenly, Ripley's account of the fearsome, acidic xenomorph seems to be a likely factor. Among the many memorable characters are Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn, who is loved worldwide for his portrayal of this and his character in THE TERMINATOR), a low key, levelheaded marine who has to take over once Sarg Apone is killed, the obnoxious and hysterically funny Prvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton, another all time favorite of mine for 30+ years), Prvt. Vasquez (played by another Cameron/Bigelow regular, Jenette Goldstein, a wonderful chameleon of an actress), and the benevolent android Bishop (Lance Henriksen, yet another Cameron legend) who is nothing like the devious Ash of the prequel.Needless to say, the entire colony, save Newt, has been destroyed. As I learned in the sequels, these aliens use humans not only as hosts with which to reproduce, they kill and use them for food as well. In the very first battle, most of the marines are slain, or worse, kidnapped and made into hosts for the facehugger parasites that hatch from eggs, leaving a handful of survivors. Their mission a bust, they attempt to leave the planet and make plans to 'nuke the site from orbit' to ensure the annihilation of this hostile species. Suddenly Mr. Burke is very vocal about his opposition to these plans, and it's not long before he is revealed to be yet another corporate pig with greedy plans to get rich. He is the true villain here, and worse than Ash, because Ash was an android programmed to do what he was told.Many harrowing but action packed battles later, many of our survivors are no more, and we finally meet 'the bitch.' Enough said. I had very high hopes about the ending...but I was in for an unpleasant surprise in the next installment of the franchise. Perhaps my 2nd favorite Cameron film. 10 stars.",10,4,8,22 December 2014

Macho muscle bound guys with big, loud cars playing annoying rap music, racing and crashing. What a plot.

She can do far better and has done far better.It didn't win me any brownie points for Vin, and to prove it, I tuned into XXX and tuned out after about 5 minutes.If this is what the general public wants, oh well...but I like my mind to be entertained too, thanks.",Null,0,2,8 September 2003
28 Days Later...," Not the scariest movie since THE EXORCIST...
","...not even close. The only time I even flinched was when Jim set off the car alarm by accident! Still, 28 DAYS LATER is a very enjoyable horror movie. I don't know why they call it a 'zombie' movie. There were no zombies. They weren't 'undead'! The 'monsters' depicted are people infected with a virus. A nasty one indeed, with rage and blood-red eyes and other yucky symptoms. The playfully twisted personality of Danny Boyle is what really makes this horror film (not my favorite genre of course) work for me. I loved TRAINSPOTTING and SHALLOW GRAVE, and this film has those bits of dark humor throughout. Loved the grocery shopping scenes and the soundtrack.The strong cast is another reason I enjoyed it. Each actor had a role for the viewer. I love Cillian Murphy (the soul whose confusion, fear and later, strength and resolve we all experience from the start of the film),Brendan Gleeson (the heart! more on that below) and Christopher Eccleston (the brain that ends up losing ability to reason), and I really enjoyed Naomie Harris (the brawn, relentlessly brutal when she's wielding that huge knife), who I hadn't seen before this film. The characters of a film to me are very important, and these characters, all their interactions and experiences, the family dynamic (Gleeson, in particular gives a beautiful performance as the father figure to the little cluster of survivors), make this one several cuts above the standard crappy horrors that are coming forth these days.Took me a while to warm up to it, but it is actually quite the classic.",8,0,1,16 August 2010
Velvet Goldmine," So much fun I didn't care about the confusing plot twist!!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILAGE!!!I am a big fan of color, glitter, and glamour!!! The citizens of the glam-rock era are way ahead of their time as they invent fashion and music that the new wavers of the '80s only IMITATED!!! If you like to see boys with lipstick, eyeshadow, high heels and blue hair, you will love this!!! If you are a fan of Queen, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, KISS, The Cure, Boy George, or Orgy, you will love this!!! Brian Slade (played by the delicately beautiful Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is the undisputed king of glam rock. With his electric blue hair and skin tight silver catsuit, he reigns supreme. But for some unexplained reason, he knocks himself off his throne, unintentionally of course, and his fans turn against him.A decade later, a British newspaperman named Arthur (Christian Bale) is assigned to find out what became of the once regal Slade. Along his journey, he remembers his own dabblings in the Glam Rock lifestyle, and his encounters with the famous rockers Slade and Curt Wild (a flamboyant, 100% pure fun performance by Ewan McGregor!!!). In interviews with Slade's first manager (Michael Feast) and wife Mandy Slade (a great turn by Toni Collette), Arthur begins to piece together the mystery of Brian Slade, pop idol de-throned.At the very end came a twist that I to this day cannot figure out. Tommy looks nothing like Brian did. I can only assume plastic surgery was involved. But why trade in such a flawless face???!!!In spite of the confusing stuff at the end, I will always like VELVET GOLDMINE!!! It's a keeper for any fan of McGregor, Rhys-Meyers, or Bale!!!",Null,3,6,5 November 2004
Gran Torino," A Treasure on Wheels and Reels!
","What is it to be truly happy? What's it like to be a part of a family, for real? This is the only Clint Eastwood (aside from MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN...which he directed) movie I have ever truly enjoyed. Without spoilers, I will say that towards the end of the film, Mr. Eastwood has to do something big and heroic and macho, in true 'dirty Harry' fashion, but it didn't detract from how much I admired this 2008 effort about a grouchy old veteran of Polish descent, who projects hatred towards Asian people. His wife has recently died, his son and grandkids don't want anything real from him, especially not relationships, and the only thing he seems to lavish affection on is his classic 1972 Gran Torino. The only person he knows who seems to want to reach out to him is a young priest (Chris Carley) and of course he is rebuffed.The old man's new neighbors are a family of Hmong, and after the teenage boy (Bee Vang) tries to get in good with a local Hmong gang by attempting to steal Mr. Kowalski's treasured car, the old man responds with his usual racist scorn. But slowly, after getting to know the boy and his sister (Ahney Her) and their large family, after becoming acquainted with their unique culture, Mr. Kowalski finds an unlikely family, and against his grumpy will, finds himself caring about them and risking his own hide to protect them from the viciousness of the gang their cousin belongs to.Without being preachy, this film accomplished what CRASH tried to several years ago. Kowalski lets go of his prejudice against Asians, gets to know a family and a culture, and suddenly has real friends for the first time in a long time. It is a unique, touching and refreshing film about the sometimes preachy concept of 'racial harmony'.",9,0,3,7 May 2010
Garden State," Coming out of the dark
","I finally decided to watch this indie because it had been compared on many points to another film I love, called THIS SPACE BETWEEN US. Both films are about how tragedy can cause a young person to withdraw and shut down emotionally, and how one comes to the point of either 'do or die' when faced with the decision to live again or just exist.Andrew Largeman (director and actor Zach Braff) is an up and coming actor in LA who is paying his dues working in a Vietnamese restaurant. He seems normal at first glance, but Andrew is often plagued with severe headaches and nightmares of himself dying in a horrific plane crash...but not really caring.One day he gets a call from his father (the great Ian Holm), who also happens to be a psychiatrist. Mother has died unexpectedly, from drowning in the bathtub. As Andrew makes the trip back to his old home turf in New Jersey, attends the funeral, and is reunited with old friends (including Peter Saarsgard (sp?) he hasn't seen in a decade, we learn that he has become estranged from his father. We learn that Andrew, at age 9, had a role in the tragic accident that left his mother paralyzed from the waist down. We learn that although it is not really Andrew's fault, that a defective kitchen appliance was to blame, Andrew has been living with guilt and depression ever since, and that Andrew's father DOES blame his son. For one reason or another, Mr. Largeman has placed his son on several antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, insisting that they are for Andrew's well being.While staying with his Dad, Andrew becomes acquainted with a bubbly young woman named Samantha (Natalie Portman), and their friendship soon becomes love, and Andrew makes the first real decision he has ever made for his life: to stop the medications and try to 'feel' again, even if it's pain and guilt over the fate of his mother, and the misery in the relationship he has with his domineering father.I haven't watched a whole lot of SCRUBS or much of the other films Braff has been in, but I was very impressed with his acting and directing. GARDEN STATE is another pleasant 'people' film, a small and quiet little story. The ending seems a little surreal, as does the plane crash sequence at the start. Speculation has been made that Andrew died in that crash and that Sam was in the telephone booth crying because she had heard about the crash. The white setting of the final scene does have a dreamlike quality. My own interpretation: Andrew did get off that plane and decide to stay with Sam, and that the whiteness of the final scene was symbolic of Andrew coming out of his world of depression, numbness and misery into the 'light'. It was effectively poignant.The 'lightness' at the beginning, in Andrew's room as his dad was phoning him with bad news? A sterile and phony 'light' that his dad imposed on him with the meds.It gets an A from me.",9,0,1,8 April 2009
World Trade Center," A great and reverent Oliver Stone movie
","Stone is known for political button pushing, but in WORLD TRADE CENTER, starring Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena as two NY port authority policemen who are literally buried alive beneath the wreckage of the WTC collapses, the director tells the story without any digressions. It's simply the true life story of John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, as well as the story of a horrible day that assaulted America and then brought us together.When the Twin Towers are hit by the hijacked planes, the brave men and women of the FDNY and the NYPD, along with the PA police, risk their lives to try to save thousands of innocent lives. When Trade Center 2 (the south tower) collapses, McLoughlin, Jimeno, and a fellow PA named Pezzulo (Jay Hernandez) survive, but soon they are buried by tons more debris when Tower One falls. While they struggle to stay conscious through the excruciating pain of their injuries, their loved ones back home anxiously await word from them.Jimeno was buried about 15 hours, McLoughlin about 22. Most of the movie is centered on them as they talk to each other and keep each other alive. It is quite dark on screen for a lot of the film and that kind of affects how much I enjoyed it, even though it's probably realistically presented. They were practically entombed. Luckily, you get to know the wives of these 2 men: Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is pregnant with their second child. Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello) is wondering if she'll ever get a chance to try to be close to her husband the way they once were.The film also showcases Michael Shannon as a dedicated Marine who decides to go to New York and help in the rescue operation that saved the lives of the 2 PA policemen.I like this film because it has no political subtext. It is what it is. A story of the real heroes of 9/11.",9,1,2,14 September 2013
Into the Wild," I'm sorry...I thought I'd really like this, but no.
","WARNING...MORE SPOILERS THAN USUAL!Emile Hirsch plays Chris, a young man brought up rich and privileged, but he dislikes his parents, thinks they're assholes. And actually, he's right. The parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden) fight in private and project phoniness in public. Sure, they're assholes. But instead of just moving out, getting his education, and making something of himself, he decides that society is just too sick and ugly to live among people in general. He decides that the only way to live a truthful and fulfilling life is to ditch our cash-happy rat race and live in a shitty bus up in the Great North somewhere...oh, except that he doesn't live there full time, only when the weather's tolerable.Otherwise, he's all over the place, and frankly, I lost track of what time frame we were in, what town he was in, and lost interest in the story in general. But I watched it to the end, hoping that perhaps this very young and self righteous brat would just get this out of his system. There are better ways of 'getting back' at your hated parents than roughing it in the harsh elements, eating poisonous berries, and slowly starving yourself until your body gives up the ghost. Sean Penn's writing is sometimes pretentiously poetic and other times just plain poor. I'm sorry, because I like most of his work. This, however, just melodramatic drivel, a story that really didn't need telling.",3,5,6,9 December 2012
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Freedom isn't cheap
","WARNING SPOILERS!The courage and resilience of the Irish during the War for Independence against Great Britain is depicted better here than in any other film I've seen about the IRA.Constantly subjected to acts of terrorism and humiliation from the Tans, a group of men from Cork have had all they can stand and join the campaign to get British tyranny out of Ireland for good. Among this group of guerilla soldiers is Teddy O'Donnovan (Padraic Delaney is an actor to watch for!) and his younger brother Damien (Cillian Murphy), who is planning to finish his medical training in London. Reluctant to get involved at first, Damien sees one of his best friends brutally murdered for no reason at all by the Tans. The constant cruelty by people who abuse their power changes his position.The film is about the unpleasant demands and duties facing these soldiers, and about the very high price of freedom. There comes a time when it seems freedom is accomplished, but there are conditions that must be met and a treaty that must be signed. It's hard to know who to side with. Teddy and those who think like him want the bloodshed to end, and he's convinced that a completely independent Ireland is just not possible when the British Empire has so much power. Damien, his friend Dan (Liam Cunningham), and others feel that this treaty is a slap in the face to those who have given their lives and suffered. Damien and Dan see that if they don't continue the battle to rid Ireland of all British dominion, the same suffering will go on and on, and their comrades will have died for nothing. Civil war breaks out among the Irish, pitting friends (and brothers) against each other, and the results are excruciatingly tragic.The film draws your emotions in as you watch the injustice, the ruthless physical and mental tortures, the difficult and terrible reality that in war, you follow orders. The execution of Damien's friend Chris Reilly (John Crean) is one of many very disturbing scenes, so be warned. I very much appreciated the role of the women in this film. The characters of Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald), Peggy and Bernadette were well developed and integral to the plot. Director Ken Loach lends sensitivity to this brilliant but brutal story, and his unusual style of direction (described lavishly in an R1 DVD extra) is interesting. I plan to see more of his work!",10,1,4,2 September 2010

","Face it, it's not GONE WITH THE WIND or TITANIC but it's a great comedy. I'm not even a KISS fan, although I learned a lot of their good songs here, but I love this hilarious raunchy comedy complete with lots of bad language, physical humor, a bit of nudity and even some really gross-out puking scenes. It's just a good time, that's all it is. I love the '70s rock and disco music, the clothing, the Stretch Armstrong doll, and the Lip Smackers Lip Gloss Christine used.

Die Hard," Still one of the most clever action films of recent years!
","Yes, believe it or not, I have always digged DIE HARD the original. The 1990 sequel wasn't too bad, but the '88 original is the very best. Just so you know, I have never hated Bruce Willis, past or present. I just think that several of his more recent films have been turkeys.This is the film that made him a superstar, being that mostly he was known for MOONLIGHTING at this time. With striking green eyes and a memorable personality, Willis was indeed 'leading man' material even in these early days. What makes this film a good one for Willis is that he played not a macho grunting void like what Arnie had been playing, but a real guy, a guy who ended up exhausted, battered and probably in need of several pints of blood by the time this ordeal was over for everyone.NYPD cop is invited by his old boss to come out to the West Coast for Christmas, which is also where his recently estranged wife lives. An uneasy reunion at the wife's company's Christmas bash is trying to take place when a group of mostly German terrorists (or are they???) invades the towering high-rise where Willis' cop and the ex-wife are. This renegade group is lead by one of my very favorite actors, the always delightful and amazing Alan Rickman.To make a long story short, the obviously focused and experienced group of criminals takes Willis' wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and her co-workers hostage. Willis manages to be in a position where he was undetected by the group and therefore able to separate himself from the other civilians who are know being terrorized. Being a cop, he tries his best to undermine the efforts of Rickman and company.A truly lovable ally for Willis is Sargeant Al Powell (Reginald ValJohnson), one of the few LA cop characters who has the intuition to help Willis rather than persecute him for his contributions to the battle being waged. The FBI, as per usual, is made to look like a bunch of buffoons, but Robert Davi is hilarious and I couldn't help but love all characters, even the jerks, like Dwayne T. Robinson (RIP Paul Gleason!) Even the terrorists themselves are brilliant, and there are countless moments of subtle hilarity and comedy coming from everyone.The only flaws I have ever noticed are bits of bad editing here and there, but so what? This is an action-packed, engaging, memorably written and acted, touching and often times funny film that is perfect every year at Christmas. After 20 years, it is more of a classic than ever before.",9,1,1,13 October 2007
Con Air," Malkovich and Buscemi are worth watching it
","This is typical fare from the Jerry Bruckheimer machine, which cranked out such razzberry-worthy mega-blockbusters as THE ROCK, ARMAGEDDON (my money back???), GONE IN 60 SECONDS, etc. Nic Cage (whose SUTHIN' ACCENT needs a ton of practice) plays Cameron Poe, a parolee from Mobile, AL, who after serving an 8 year sentence for manslaughter, is finally going to meet his little girl and reunite with the wife. The plane he is boarding to go home in is about to be taken over by a bunch of career criminals like Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), Cyrus Grissom (John Malkovich) and Pin-Ball (Dave Chapelle), who are planning to pick up a Columbian Drug Lord at Carson City, and fly off to a non-treatied country.
Malkovich is always a gleefully naughty villain. Chapelle is a good comic relief, although the whole movie really is a comic crime adventure. Mykelti Williamson as Poe's pal Baby-O is a good support. M.C. Gainey as Swamp Thing, the wacky con who pilots the fugitive plane is a hoot--- just the wacky insane look in his eyes will bust your guts!!! Steve Buscemi as the Marrietta Mangler a.k.a. Garland Greene, is right where he goes best, as a psycho who says a lot of things that disturbingly make sense!!!Colm Meaney and John Cusack play federal agents who oppose each other's tactics as much as they oppose the actions of the convicts.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The darkest chapter, the end of the tunnel, then the light of 'a new hope' on the horizon...
","Well, my only disappointment with Episode III is that I felt Anakin's reaction to Padme's death was ruined by the Darth Vader mask. I was hoping to see the burnt and crippled Anakin told about Padme while he was being repaired in the hospital. I would have liked to see Hayden's face, see him cry in anguish, knowing that after everything he did to 'save' her, he actually was the one who killed her. Not by the death choke, but by killing her belief in him, killing her will to live. How horrible to learn that your husband has turned to evil when you're about to give birth to his children??? If you loved Anakin as much as she did, nothing could save you. Her hope and faith in him was destroyed, and that was a very powerful and emotional scene when she said, 'You're breaking my heart!!!' Natalie Portman is to be commended for such a strong supportive role. Anyway, back to Anakin. Once that mask was on, he was indeed more machine than man, and the whole 'anguish and grief' thing with Vader just didn't do it for me. Also, to see Anakin struggling to breathe before the mask was placed would have been great. I was under the impression that he absolutely could not breathe without a ventilator, and then the mask/apparatus of the Vader mask. I'm sure his lungs were scorched severely when he was burned alive. The scene with Anakin falling near the lava and him beginning to burn was deeply disturbing and well done!!! To me, burns are the most horrible injuries, so painful and disfiguring. When Darth Sidious 'saved' the life of Anakin, he proved to me just how evil he was. Instead of being merciful and letting Anakin die, he put the poor thing on life support, so that he could continue having an 'apprentice' to use for his dirty work!!! Anakin Skywalker is such a tragic character. I realize now that STAR WARS is in fact not just the story of how Luke Skywalker undermines the plans of the Emperor and Lord Vader, but it's the story of two children and their father. Anakin/Vader is in all six films, Luke is in but 3, or 4 if you count the newborn Luke. When you look to the side of the war and the awesome special effects of these films, you find a very original and wonderful family story. Sorry if I'm annoying anyone...I just got back and I'm feeling rather heavy-hearted. The film is not a happy one. But it's absolutely brilliant and the darkness is necessary. There's nothing sadder to me than seeing a gifted, handsome young man, happily married to a beautiful woman with children on the way, fall prey to an evil, ruthless, ambitious coward who hides behind the retiring facade of a senator. Anakin is lied to, manipulated, brainwashed, and set to work as an assassin who murders men, women and children. In the end, he loses everything, his wife, his children, his friendships, including with Obi-Wan, all because he made the grave mistake of allowing himself to believe that somehow the Dark side would give him the power to save Padme from death. Now I understand why the death of Shmi Skywalker lead Anakin to kill. He never understood why it was so important not to get too close to anyone, because the fear of losing them leads to the anger and rage that would end in even more death and suffering. It's terrible that a Jedi isn't allowed to marry, but now I see that it's really not in a Jedi's best interest to get too close to people. I have to offer defense for Christensen. So many on here think he's a lousy actor. Sorry, you're wrong. His emotional, tumultuous performance is what impressed me above everything else. I saw the scenes where Anakin is crying shortly before he really gives himself over to evil and kills the Jedi younglings. It's an amazing transformation and very skilled acting.I see, too, why Darth Vader becomes so ruthless and emotionless. Having lost everything he ever loved and cherished, having lost his whole life, he decides to abandon everything about what he was. 'That name no longer has any meaning for me.' Now he is an evil agent with no agenda except to please his Master. What a sad existence for him. I don't want to sound like a lovesick teenager (I'm 35 actually) but Hayden Christensen is BEAUTIFUL, especially so in Episode III. And I think the reason that the story of Anakin/Darth Vader ends up successful is because this monster, this robotic Sith Lord in a gruesome mask that probably made millions of 6 year olds wet their beds at night after a trip to the theeater in 1977, was once a very beautiful, very young, very impressionable young man with his whole life ahead of him, who was too headstrong and ambitious for his own good, as George Lucas said. It would be easier to continue looking at Vader as a monster to hate if he hadn't began life in such a promising way. It's only too relieving that in Episode VI, Anakin's humanity is revived by his son Luke.REVENGE OF THE SITH is very dark, very tragic. It's pretty violent when compared with the other films. It's great that R2 is around for some light laughs when he tries to help the Jedi with elevators and fights off a bunch of parasitic droids who land on fighters and try to disassemble them. EwanMcGregor gives another great performance as Obi-Wan Kenobi, probably his strongest performance of the 3 new films. Episode III is a satisfying movie that explains and answers questions and provides a good bridge extending to the old trilogy, where 'hope' for the galaxy lies. A big thank you to George Lucas. I love STAR WARS now more than ever!!!",9,2,5,22 May 2005
Inception," Nifty premise, a fun movie, but not perfect
","I have to admit, this is a first for me, a movie about the world of dreams. Plotwise pretty original, though I can't honestly say I remember the plot of DREAMSCAPE from 1984. The special effects are dazzling, naturally, and the plot is fun. You don't even care whether or not it's possible to 'control' the course of your dreams (I've found it impossible), let alone the 'layering' of dreams. Each layer has a different landscape, and anyone who loves action and battles and stunts will enjoy this.It's not perfect. They never explain the apparatus used in inducing sleep. Is it some kind of intravenous device? Also, the moral implications of invading a rich man's mind and plant an idea (intellectual rape IMO) for the benefit of another rich man are never discussed. I suppose I am to keep in mind that these are professional thieves working for corporate pigs who don't give a crap about ethics.Though Cillian Murphy gives his all, his character is not given an opportunity to be anything more than the victim in a conspiracy. He really isn't afforded a chance to be a solid individual, and if you're familiar with his work, you've come to expect character, not just actions, even in a Chris Nolan movie (his Scarecrow was the most amusing ingredient in BATMAN BEGINS). Like one review said, Murphy's reaction to his father's actions regarding a second will (which is nothing more than an implantation by his greedy peer Saito) was cut short before it could have any true emotional impact on viewers.Actually, aside from Cobb and Mal (see below) none of the characters are truly developed as individuals. Sure, you get a funny little homoerotic vibe between Eames (Tom Hardy) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon Leavitt), and Ellen Page, like Murphy, tries to lend her depth to the architect Ariadne. Still...If not for the mangled emotions of Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) over his beautiful late wife Mal (Marion Cotillard), this film might have been nothing but action. DiCaprio and Cotillard are honestly the only two actors who are really given more to do than just action sequences. Their complex relationship, before and after Mal's demise, is a very surprising and beautiful and necessary part of the film.I've asked myself whether INCEPTION is fiendishly clever and original or completely ridiculous. In some ways, it's both. Some elements disappointed, but I can't say I didn't buy it or that I don't enjoy watching it every few months.",7,2,11,20 April 2011
Scream," Devilishly clever spoof!!!
","I still relish this hilarious, ultraviolent first of a trilogy starring Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Drew Barrymore, and Rose McGowan. It's got very clever above standard writing, terrific scares, and load of belly-laughs, which really is what makes it fun. I don't usually crave standard horror where there is lots of blood but no laughter. I think my favorite scene is where Billy and Stu stab each other as part of their big scheme to frame Sid's dad for the killings. Arquette is wonderful, had lots of great comedy lines. McGowan's character is mean to Arquette, but it was sad to see her go!!! Jamie Kennedy is the heart of the movie, he is adorable!!! Any naysayers that declare this is NOT horror: Well, it is a spoof, a parody. But there are so many scares that will make you leap out of your couch, and so much blood and screaming, that it's safe to say that the horror element is very strong. It's a horror comedy!!! A++++",10,0,0,10 April 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," Truly mesmorizing
","This movie is one I can watch over and over and never get sick of.  As a matter of fact,  after all these years,  there are still parts that I don't understand fully.  I love movies that take me a long time to figure them out!!!  I don't have the intellect required to just give a rundown on what it's about,  except that it's a facinating,  sophisticated,  brilliant psychological thriller (not a horror movie by any standards).  It is terrifying but not because of blood,  violence or gore.  Rather,  it chills you to the bone with what is unseen and unknown.  Jodie Foster (an actress of unmatched intensity and one-of-a-kind performances) stars as Clarice Starling,  an FBI trainee who is just a week away from becoming a full-fledged agent.  At the request of Behavior Field Science agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn),  Starling travels to a Baltimore psychiatric hospital to meet renowned serial murderer and former psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins) hoping to gain insight on how to crack unsolved serial murder casees.  From the moment they meet,  their relationship is riveting,  separated by differing values and a sheet of glass,  yet united in eerily intimate ways.  It's this intimacy that leads to an offer made by Lecter to Starling,  an offer that might be the chance of a lifetime for Starling to make a difference,  to save a life.  This movie is enormously entertaining,  but it's also intellectually stimulating and challenging, and not very many movies are like that to me.  Presently,  The Sixth Sense is a well-done addition to this few and far between genre,  though not quite as frightening as 'Lambs'.  I credit a lot of the chill factor of this movie to Hopkins,  whose soft-spoken eloquence only served to enhance the undeniable evil Lecter represented.  The lighting in the cell made his usually soulful blue eyes seem fish-like and lifeless,  as if to transmit to the viewer the absence of soul and morality.  Excellent work!!! ****",10,0,0,7 September 1999
Tombstone," Fun Fun Fun From Beginning To End!!!
","WARNING...MIGHT BE SOME SPOILERS!!!This is the best 'new' Western movie I've ever seen and it's still one that I can watch and it's never stale or loses its power.  It's got a terrific all star cast (without the really big tiresome annoying names)and it's just pure entertainment,  action,  comedy,  drama.  I just love Kurt Russell, he's perfect as the most famous of the three Earp brothers,  Wyatt,  a former U.S. Marshall who migrates from Kansas to the silver-rush boomtown of Tombstone, Arizona, hoping to strike it rich and live a more peaceful life as a civilian.  He meets up with his brothers Virgil (another perfectly cowboy-ish actor, Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). There are a couple of snags in the way of happiness for Wyatt though.  His wife is addicted to laudenaum (an old time version of morphine) and there is a gang of vicious criminals who frighten even the sheriff and mayor of the little boomtown. Lead by Ringo (the always magnificent Michael Biehn) and Curly Bill (Powers Boothe) these Cowboys wear red sashes and wreak havok on the streets, shooting innocent people,  terrorizing the local businesses and generally making life miserable for everyone in town. Eventually, Virgil and Morg get fed up with the Cowboy Gang and decide to get involved with a campaign to get rid of them,  much to Wyatt's chagrin...all he wants is to live life in peace,  without guns and violence.  But he soon finds out that there will never be any peace until someone shows the Cowboys that their violence and mayhem won't be tolerated.  With the help of their loyal friend Doc Holliday, (Val Kilmer's finest moments!!!) who is suffering with 'consumption',  The Earp Brothers wage an all out war that includes the famous 'Gunfight At the O.K. Corral'.  There are some sad, wrenching moments of violence and death and blood, some heartfelt romance and Doc Holliday's smart aleck one liners make for some great comedy relief!!! I give it ****!!!",Null,0,1,18 May 2002
Flight," My God this was awful!
","Just horrible. Denzel has always been a 'hit and miss' kinda guy IMO. I admire his acting ability, but this movie is just absurdly bad. I am not a prude, but gratuitous nudity in a movie never sits well with me. I usually enjoy Zemekis' movies too, but this is a festering turd of a disaster of a disaster flick. Denzel plays Whip, an airline pilot who does every drug on the street and guzzles the juice as well. Before the first five minutes, you lose all ability to sympathize or like the guy. And what's with the F word every other word? AGAIN, I AM NOT A PRUDE, but dialogue is destroyed by the overuse of profanity. This was why I didn't like PULP FICTION either. The only remotely entertaining and riveting scenes are of course the malfunction of the stabilizer and the ensuing crash scene. After this, the movie descends further into caca and chaos, not sure which direction or genre to adopt...spiritual odyssey??? Comedy??? Mystery??? No...just a damn mess!If you want something better, skip this atrocity and just watch the episode CUTTING CORNERS/FATAL ERROR of AIR CRASH INVESTIGATION, which I am told FLIGHT was inspired by.",1,4,7,17 March 2014
Apollo 13," The best film of 1995
","Me and my Mom saw this at the theatre in the summer of 1995 and it was such a beautiful satisfying movie experience. I continue to marvel at the skill in which Ron Howard spinned the tale based on the true incident which happened in April 1970. I adore this movie, even to the point of being corny!!! Let me just say that everything, from the music to the period detail, was beautifully brought to life.  I loved all the guys in Houston with their 1970-looking hairdos, clothing and horn rimmed glasses,  I loved the big honking (now antique looking) TV in the Lovell's living room, I loved Kathleen Quinlan's retro clothing and earrings (she's such a lovely woman and actress) and I loved the acuracy of the rocket, the command module, the lunar module (that spidery looking guy) and the little pod with the parachutes. The cast was absolutely perfect. Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell, the commander of the Apollo 13 mission to the moon, was brilliant, and brought all the excitement and anticipation...and then disappointment and fear, to life. Bill Paxton is always a joy to watch, portraying astronaut Fred Haise, whose wife is pregnant. Paxton displays a childlike joy in his excitement about 'flying in space' for the very first time. Kevin Bacon was quiet and strong as Jack Swigert, a 'bachelor' astronaut, and his feelings of guilt over what happened to the spacecraft were very tangible to me. Gary Sinise was a fabulous support as astronaut Ken Mattingly, who was supposed to be the pilot, but was held back from the mission because of exposure to measles.  Ed Harris, ahh, Ed Harris. I love this guy. He turned in a fiery, commanding, yet lovely performance as the head of the flight operations in Houston. The stress that Gene Kranz must have been under looked exhausting coming from Harris. While the crew of Apollo 13 awaits a plan for re-entering Earth's atmosphere safely, they encounter problem after problem, loss of power, loss of breathing oxygen, increase in toxic CO2 gas, freezing cold because of the lack of electicity,  a kidney infection in Haise, inappropriate weight, velocity and angle for re-entry, and if all that weren't enough, their parachutes might not open and the heat sheild might have been damaged to where the astronauts would be incinerated before they can return to earth!!! Oh yeah, and a typhoon in the south Pacific too!!! This movie is over two hours long, but it is so absorbing, so interesting, and so riveting, that not one milisecond is boring. The supporting cast also features Xander Berkely, Clint Howard, Loren Dean and many other familiar faces whose names escape me, as the hard working, wonderful staff of experts in Houston who were DETERMINED to bring the three men of Apollo 13 home alive. This movie was perfect. I can't say a bad thing about it. It deserved Film Of The Year for 1995 (I don't even remember which film got the award, so it must not have been all that memorable) and I think it is Ron Howard's finest film to date.",Null,0,0,26 February 2003
Contact," One of my favorite sci-fi films!!!
","Jodie Foster really should have gotten a third Academy Award for this truly enthralling adventure film. She plays an astronomer who gets grant money for a project that is criticized by many respected people in her field. But one night, she hears a pulsating signal from space, and from there, watch the film!!! The great cast includes the beautiful Matthew McConaughey as pretty much a love interest. I like that for once a film shows a female protag with a male love interest in a genre that is mainly populated by men. Also in the cast are Angela Bassett, James Woods, David Morse, William Fichtner, Tom Skerrit, Jake Busey, and John Hurt. My favorite scenes are always when Jodie walks across the walkway toward her spaceship with the ocean hissing and the machine whirring below her. And then the journey she takes, beautiful!!!",Null,0,2,20 April 2004
