The Devil's Advocate," typical hollywood- burning up a good idea
","I liked the idea for this film. I liked the general themes and issues. The majority of the acting (excepting mr reeves of course, whose 'supreme shock and surprise' face looks exactly like his ' i've just discovered that my badger is a quadruped' face) is excellent; beyond question.The film is woefully executed, there is no suspense. We are told from the start that there are bad people who look especially bad in the 'hero''s eyes and ...wow... they really are bad.Pacino (as always) is the devil, but he is the devil the whole way through the film. He sticks his hand in the font and makes it boil; scary - if we hadn't been treated to a hell of a lot of his evil winks and leers in the process.Hello director, the things that the script said about being the least expected thing were pandering to the least intelligent things on the planet. Treat your audience with more than big names, there are people out there with half a brain that could have walked out twenty minutes into this film and told everybody else what would happen in the end.Verdict?

American Psycho," why?
","Why do most questions on this site centre on what actually happened in the film?In any film the reality that we are presented with is not any actual reality. it depends entirely upon a directorial eye. With this in mind it is hard to judge the success of the film.There are moments of postmodern brilliance (when he shoots at the cars and they explode with a single shot), and there are equal moments of frustration (anyone for pastiche?).It could never be the book (what could?) and that is not the point. this is a film, it is not great. but there are great things about it.",Null,0,1,17 March 2004
