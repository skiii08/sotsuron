Angels & Demons," Angels and Demons
","After the ridiculous amount of hype that surrounded the release of The Da Vinci Code it was only a matter of time before Dan Browns 'other' Robert Langdon novel got the big screen treatment with Ron Howard returning as director and Tom Hanks (sans mullet) playing the said Robert Langdon.This time Robert Langdon finds himself embroiled in another church cover up when the Illuminati rise from the underground and attempt to destroy the Catholic church and the only man capable in the entire world, of stopping this event, is of course Robert Langdon.Tom Hanks is fine as Robert Langdon and kudos for him for being brave enough to wear Speedos in todays critical era and to say some of his lines in such a straight and serious manner without sniggering. The rest of the cast were fine, although Ewan McGregors Irish accent faltered on many occasions.The plot, like the novel, has enough twists and turns to keep the audience engrossed and some of the set pieces, especially the 'fire' scene are very unsettling to watch. There was a good mix of suspense and action to break up all the talking and trips to the Vatican Archives (which was not anything like I pictured them to be when I read the book!)The sets were gorgeous to look at - replica or not the locations were impressive.No matter how intelligent this movie, or indeed any of Dan Browns novels claim to be, what they essentially boil down to is a grown up treasure hunt, with an intelligent man, sprouting exposition which, when read appears incredulous, but when spoken on the big screen, is at times down right laughable, in the chase to find this particular movies 'holy grail'. I would give the movie 8/10 but perhaps that is being overly generous. It is a very entertaining movie granted, but the entire success of Robert Langdons mission depended solely on the fact that in 400 years not one of the cleaning ladies in Vatican City moved any of the conveniently placed statues which so helpfully (literally) pointed out the way in every church - either that or the Illuminati where in charge of the cleaning. Dan Brown is given a lot of criticism for his writing. He is not going to be remembered amongst the great modern writers, but what he good at is tapping into all the clich√©s and tricks used to keep the reader hooked, with constant cliff-hangers and interesting snippets of fiction portrayed as fact and like him or loath him - it works. Angels and Demons is a very watchable movie and the fact that these types of movies are still very profitable is probably a conspiracy Da Vinci would be proud of",8,8,16,15 May 2009
The Young Victoria," Almost reining supreme
","The Young Victoria follows the early years of Britain's longest serving monarch Queen Victoria (Emily Blunt) through to her marriage to Prince Albert (Rupert Friend).All the usual ingredients of a costume drama are present and of course that is a good thing. Where would a costume drama be without the flamboyant dresses, beautiful countryside or the complicated dances? The ingredients were all present but that does not mean to say that they were there in the right quantity, mixed together correctly or were cooked at the right temperature. What this ridiculous metaphor is attempting to say is that although it had the makings of a great drama it did fall short.As with all stories following the British monarchy we are treated to life at court, conspiracy and conniving but this all fell quite short of the mark. The viciousness or desperation that makes such good viewing just wasn't there. It felt as though it was all just mentioned in passing. The ever dependable Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne and Mark Strong (who is everywhere these days) as Sir John Conroy were very watchable at trying to play the political game but to be honest very little happened.The best scenes in the whole movie were those that focused on Victoria and Albert. Their game of chess was filled with tension and absorbing to watch. Although the movie was clearly about Victoria's younger years I think that it should have focused more on her life with Albert They had nine children together and lived happily together up until Albert's death. The fact that she lived for almost forty years without her sole mate is heartbreaking and this would have given some good strong emotional scenes but this opportunity was missed.The music was actually very imposing and the coronation music actually sounded like the start of the Champions League coverage which was also very distracting It was a very enjoyable movie but it just lacked that defining moment where Victoria transformed from this sheltered teenager into a strong willed women who reined supreme. It gets a 7/10.",7,5,14,7 March 2009
Star Trek," Living long whilst prospering
","I am not a Star Trek fan. I know who Captain Kirk is, I have heard of Spock, Scotty and a Klingon, although admittedly all I know of them is if you get one of the starboard bow you are screwed. I went to see Star Trek not to pick plot holes, inconsistencies with the original or to have a bitch in general - I went solely because it looked like a good movie.The opening scene focuses on George Kirk, father of James T, becoming Captain of the Enterprise and rescuing eight hundred people in a total of twelve minutes, sacrificing his life in the process. The opening battle was beautifully shot - the sound of the explosions were muted and we had the pleasure of hearing a simple orchestral score over the action. It was the kind of shot a lesser movie would have ended on rather that opened with. This was a good sign.The movie follows the known crew of the Enterprise though their first battle with the Romulans the leader of them being Eric Banas Nero whose reasons for his mass genocide of the Vulcan race was actually the most confusing in cinematic history. The plot, apart from the confusing Romulan back-story was very strong and there were some genuinely funny moments, all of which were intentional. Simon Pegg, Karl Urban and Chris Pine were all very capable of playing such legendary characters but the casting of Winona Ryder as Spocks mother did throw me slightly -either her life of crime as aged her drastically or else her digital ageing was completely unnecessary - just cast someone of the appropriate age or if you feel the need to add a star cameo for the love of god pick an actual star!I was pleasantly surprised about how good this movie actually was. I am glad it was an early summer blockbuster as it may have gotten lost in the Transformers2 of T4 hype but it thoroughly enjoys its success and if there is a sequel I would go and see it.I would give the movie a rare 10/10. I don't know if it was consistent with the original series and I don't care that I probably missed a ton of in-jokes and throw backs to the TV show but what I do know from my complete and utter newbie point of view is that last night I saw a bloody impressive movie. Bring on the sequel.",10,4,14,9 May 2009
Coraline," Coraline
","Coraline follows the story of a young girl (voiced by Dakota Fanning) who has just moved into a new house with her parents (Terri Hatcher and John Hodgman). As her parents are too busy to spend time with her she goes exploring and comes across a doorway in the living room wall which leads her to an alternate reality where she meets her Other Mother and Other Father and a the usual morality tale ensues.This children's movie is directed by Henry Selick, the genius behind The Nightmare Before Christmas the kids film that adults enjoy more than any child so although it is bright and colourful be warned that the plot itself is told in a really dark manner which is not suitable for young children. The Other Mother is a fantastically scary Character that even Maleficent would have nightmares about. There were a couple of five to six year olds that were not happy during some of the scarier moments of the movie and to be honest I was more scared during Coraline than I have ever been during an adult horror movie.Unlike most children's films there is a very strong story being told on screen and there is something very unsettling about the buttons for eyes idea.The version I watched was in 3D and there were some nice moments but this movie, although gorgeous to look at is all about the story so if you cant see it in 3D then do not worry.There isn't the usual celebrity voice cast which is refreshing and the movie contains some very clever set pieces and characters.I would give it an 8/10. It is a fantastically brightly coloured, dark in content story which is not suitable for children under five and adults over twenty-three.",8,1,3,5 May 2009
Pirate Radio," The Boat Rocks
","Its not often I will see a comedy in the cinema, in fact the biggest laughs from me in the cinema usually come from movies that are unintentionally funny. The last time I honestly saw a laugh out loud comedy (twice) in the cinema was Hot Fuzz and it is important to note that it was British. The last few comedies I have the displeasure of watching in the cinema were The Accidental Husband and I honestly think I died a little inside after those long ninety minutes and Pineapple Express, a movie that would have been so much better if the Pegg/Frost/Wright team had thought of it first. Key point - they are British and they made Hot Fuzz.I don't know what it is with American comedies - I don't get the Superbad/Knocked up humour that is constantly topping the box office. The Frat Pack are now old and embarrassing (Ben Stiller hasn't made a decent movie in years!!) and the Uma Thurman/Jennifer Aniston school of comedy was never funny to begin with. Maybe its just that I don't get America humour any more. I cant watch Friends. I have never watched Ugly Betty and I have even lost interest in Family Guy. The only America comedy show that I will watch and laugh out aloud to is South Park, a show that does parody, satirical humour and down right silliness to brilliant extremes. Maybe that says more about me. Maybe I am stuck in the past with my love of Pythonesque humour and bitterness as in the wonderful world of Black Books. Maybe my comedy taste hasn't moved on to the strange world of gross out and dorky teens having awkward sexual encounters with baked goods or themselves and don't get me started on Juno and you know what?Thank God for that.The Boat That Rocked is British and I am grateful for that. If it were an American comedy it would have been set on the crystal clear waters of Miami with beautiful skinny girls lying on beaches and surfers surfing whilst looking like they were at an Adonis convention, but no The Boat That Rocked is full of unattractive misfits (Bill Nighy, Nick Frost, Philip Seymour Hoffman et al) , each one with their unique personality, radio broadcaster style, and all containing a passion for music.The movie takes place in the late 60's where pirate radio was at its peak and the biggest pirate radio station of them all is Radio Rock, which is situated on the North Sea on an old rusty boat.The plot was admittedly paper thin. Pirate Radio station pushes boundaries and annoys Parliament. Parliament tries to abolish pirate radio station. Pirate Radio station rebels. There was also a 'who's the daddy?' sub-plot thrown in. It wasn't the strongest of plots but I didn't care. The characters were all so likable and the big bad British Parliament so over their top in the evilness you did become emotionally invested. You are invested to such a high degree that when the final act comes, which made the last 30mins of Titanic seems like a trip out in a riverboat, it was really hard to watch. Not only are you involved with the characters on the boat, you also realise that you are totally in love with the Boat itself - it became like the Serenity for the sea.The soundtrack was awesome and although there were quite a lot of montage scenes I didn't mind as they were always fun - most notably the stag scene to Lazy Sunday Afternoon by Toy Dolls and a fabulously touching underwater scene to Father and Son by Cat Stevens. There are a few key scenes to look out for - the Spartacus scene were they all decide one by one to stand up to the law, Simon's Dusty Springfield scene and the entire final act. Some people will not like it. Some people will complain about the perhaps to simple plot but I say embrace it. Enjoy the enjoy the silliness, enjoy the music and just roll with it.9/10. It loses the point for having Duffy sing over the end credits - the sound track was so impressive and original only to lose it at the very last second.",9,3,10,4 April 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Wolverine claws at box office (awful awful pun)
","In 2002 X2 arrived and marked one of the strongest Marvel sequels ever made and inevitably in 2006 X3-The Last Stand arrived and boy did it suck. A change of director caused a change of setting, style, tone, character development and to be frank skill. The man who brought the world Chris Tucker almost single-handedly killed of a franchise so here we are three years later in 2009 with the X-Men Team dropped and replaced by the first of a new Origins series and of course we start with Wolverine, the show hog of the first three movies.The opening sequence follows Wolverines back-story from a brief childhood scene to his many cameos at each major war America has been involved in - so there are quite a lot. James (young Wolverine) and Victor (Young Sabertooth) travel the world together and in true montage form Victor strays further towards the dark-side whereas James becomes more moralistic with each war. At the end of the opening credits montage we are introduced to William Stryker. James and Victor are recruited into his mercenary programme, which include mutants as Agent Zero, Beak (rather pointless) John Wraith (token black character), Fred Dukes, who literally grows into Blob and Wade Wilson played by the scene stealing Ryan Reynolds.The hype surrounding the Wade Wilson cameo was huge and it would be interesting to see just how large that role was intended to be. Ryan Reynolds had about ten lines in total but completely stole the show as anyone who fights with swords in an automatic machine gun era generally would. This didn't surprise me and I was ready for all the Deadpool Origins rumours that would no doubt start but the fate his character met has made be doubt that would ever happen which is the most depressing part of the whole movie.Obviously the most important aspect of any Wolverine story is adamantium and we were treated to a strong solid explanation as to how he came to be equipped with his adamantium skeleton and claws and it was done in such a way that justified Wolverines need for vengeance against Stryker and Sabertooth and he enlists the help of Remy le Beau, Gambit, and escapee from The Island (stupid name), a facility Stryker had set up to experiment on mutants to create a super mutant.Fans of Wolverine, X-Men and Marvel either love Gambit or hate him. There are those who think it is sacrilege that the only mention of Gambit in the X-Men movies is his name flashing up on a computer and there are those who think that he would add nothing to proceedings. I am a 90's kid, I watched the X-Men cartoon so I am the former. I was eagerly awaiting Gambits first appearance on the big screen and I wasn't disappointed. The accent wasn't quite what I was expecting but was anyone ever honestly expecting a good Cajun accent? If anything it is most likely a Gambit Origins movie we will get when you see how his character was left hanging in the end -Wolverine ditched him and he never caught up with Scott Summers and Emma Frost so never got to join the X-Men¬Ö..nice cameo at the end by the way! Live Schrieber was very good as Sabertooth - as good as Jackman is Wolverine. They played off each other well but they were both out performed in the fight stakes by Weapon 11 in the final battle but if ever there is a call to have Sabertooth in a movie I hope they have Schriebers number on speed dial.I was looking forward to Wolverine but I was nervous too. If this movie bombed it would probably mark the end of the X series and poor cold water on any future attempts at a spin off but luckily it was a good movie. It was quite slow to start with but once injected with adamantium the movie picked up pace and we were off. As with most action movies the love interest scenes are the weakest but that is just part and parcel of any movie.I would give it 7/10. It loses a point for the lack of Deadpool, Gambit, the pointless lumberjack scenes (just get on with it) and a point for throwing in a full naked Jackman waterfall scene without prior warning as I nearly choked on my Smarties trying to get my neck craned at the appropriate angle at such rapid speed. Other than that it was all good.",7,1,4,2 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Americas make the Action. The British make fun-and do it better
","I discovered Shaun of the Dead a few years after it was released and it is one of my favourite films so I had very high hopes for this film. I have a habit of getting so excited about a film it turns out to be such a let down in the cinema - see X3 and Eragon for a reference so as much as I was excited about Hot Fuzz to be honest I was expecting to be let down badly.How wrong was I.This film deserves to be more of a cult classic than Shaun of the Dead. It is def one of the best comedies that I have ever seen.It is hard to know where to start when you are reviewing a film that you have to look really hard to find a flaw in........It took almost every action movie clich√©, and completely took the mickey clean out of it, and what made it funnier is that they played it straight.There are so many lines and scenes that will be memorable for a long time, the fence scene, the cornetto scene (both parodying their last film), anything involving the swan, the Andies and the rest of the police staff. I thought that the cast singing The Cardigans 'Love Me' at the end of Romeo and Juliet was priceless. One of the biggest laughs came from the Bill Baily revelation at the end of the movie.The gun fight in the supermarket was fantastic. Andy yelling in pain because he got the dolmio sauce on him and the other Andy got mad as he thought he got shot was hilarious. The whole did you say anything conversation between Danny & Angel when Angel put Lurch in the freezer was probably the best exchange between the two and completely mocks crappy cheesy one liners after a battle, although it could never beat Ripleys 'Stay away from her you b*tch!' from Aliens The 'backdraft' line has got to be the funniest off screen line since Bill Murray in Ghostbusters yelling 'the flowers are still standing!' when he was messing around with the table clothes in the hotel whilst the others were trying to capture slimer The homo erotic subtext through out the film 'I won it for you' was probably the funniest thing throughout the whole movie. Michael Bay will probably wishes that he had played the relationship between the cops in Bad Boys 2 in an ironic way.I loved the product placement of vodafone when Angel was travlleling to the village. Nomally in American films it is the latest flashy car or watch but here apart from vodafone we had cornetto (if you would call that product placement), special K and Dolmeo.I have never felt the need to comment on the lighting of a movie before but I though that the way Danny & Angels faces were light up bright red during the opening the boot scene was like the scene from Road Kill where the brothers and Venna open the boot to find the CB radio - although most people will say that it is a Tarintino moment. Also Angel going into the shop and setting the cash down on the table also reminded me of Road Kill to. The other brilliant lighting moment was when the neighbourhood watch people were sitting around with their torches and they all turned and shined them on Angel, and he was perfectly lit up. I think that this is making fun of scenes in movies where candles can light up a whole room.I also loved the fact that there was a dramatic montage of the police officers filling up the evidence room with all the but guns etc only to have the usual lets get the big guns out montage which is usually found in cop movies - see Bad Boys and Miami Vice.There was one overly gross out killing (reporter) and one jump out of your seat moment (danny suddenly appearing after the hotel fight with Lurch) but because these were so unexpected they were brilliant.If i had to pick a flaw, it would be the overly loud slamming of doors etc. This was annoying the first few times but you got used to it.Although it mocked action movies the action in it was nothing to be ashamed of and was probably more exciting the anything Michar Bay could come up with. I think that because Pegg and Frost are not big, fit, over muscled, American cops it made the shoot out so much better.Anyway this is clearly an overlong and rambling review so I would give it a 10/10. Americans bring the action. The British take the P!ss and come out on top.",10,1,3,17 February 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Pirates Drowned at Sea
","I went to see Pirates 3 the day after it opened and to be honest it was a huge letdown.The plot was over crowded and messy. There were reports that it had not been completed by the time shooting had started and it showed.I don't mind and ensemble cast but this movie will be used as an example in later years to prove why less is more.There was just to much going on.Johnny Depp was as consistent as ever as Jack Sparrow, and that is nota compliment. Yes he nailed his performance as Jack yet again, but one character does not make a movie. I did not like all the Jacks when he was hallucinating through out the movie it didn't work and it looked as though the writers had a bad day and thought 'I know lets just add a few more Jacks for comic relief to hide the fact that we don't know where the plot is going yet!' Orlando Bloom hardly had any screen time, not that I am complaining. He sailed off into the Sunset in Davey Jones ship and hopefully will stay out to sea collecting souls for ten yearsKeira Knightly got even more screen time in Pirates3 and has gone full circle from damsel in distress to ass kicking Pirate leader which is a good thing Captain Norrington the most fleshed out character went from being a major player in the Pirates 2 to having a bit part in Pirates 3 and to add injury to the insult he was killed of in a quick sword fight by a character he had never met before for no particular reason.Bootstrap Bill went insane and killed Norrington for no reason then sailed off with Will. No actual real point of this character We had more of the comedy pirates and more of the comedy British soldiers to add even more comedy to an already unfunny film. Don't get me wrong - some of the comedy worked and only some of it. The movie was in danger of being to expensive and full of its own smugness for its own goodBarbossa was back and we can all be thankful for that. Geoffrey Rush stole the show and was clearly enjoying himself all throughout the movie.The Black Pearl crew were all back and had a few fun moments.The meeting of the Pirate Lords was interesting and was a fun idea. The Keith Richards cameo added to the films self importance. He served no purpose and was just a pat on the film makers back. He added nothing in the long run to the film apart from a few pre-release headlines.The action was very good though - especially the action at sea and the battles on the ships. It was exciting to see all the Pirate ships line up against all the British Soldiers. I did not like the super size Tia Dalma/ Calypso it looked bad and served no purpose in the end as she jumped into the sea in a huff never to be seen or spoken of again - so much for hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.Pirates1 was a fantastic film and still is and Johnny Depp thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination for trying something a bit different, but Pirates of the Caribbean did not ask for a sequel nor to be made into a trilogy. Films are sometimes better left alone and not turned into a trilogy just for the sake of it.The Pirates trilogy is just a money making machine and clearly ran out of ideas and steam at the end of the 2nd one. Of course there will be people who will defend this movie to the death, but honestly enough is enough. Pirates3 ended with a hint of a 4th and judging by the amount of money this one has made it is a possibility.I give this movie 4 out of 10. A point for the action, a point for Barbossa, a point for the score which was again very good, and a point for me - for actually sitting through the whole 2hour plus saga.Don't rent then movie - you wont watch it until the end.The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has now officially drowned in its own hype.",4,1,3,16 June 2007
Cloverfield," Running scared - right to the top of the box office
","I love it when you go to the movies to see a film that you know very little about - The Sixth Sense was one and look how that turned out. With Cloverfield there was so much mystery and so many rumours I avoided everything but the trailer until I went to see it.The movie starts off with Robs farewell party which is shown quite a bit in the trailer. It is there we meet our cast - Rob, his true love (which unfortunately for everyone he only realises this after the first attack) Beth, his brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily, Hud who acts as the cameraman and sarcastic commentator, a character which you will either love or hate and the girl that he loves Marlena. The characters are all pretty much one dimensional but it doesn't matter - there is no time to delve into their back story and get to know then - we know all we need to know from the party.After a very quick introduction to everyone the attack on New York begins and the head of the Statue of Liberty is one of the first casualties in the attack. It was one of the most memorable moments of the trailer yet it was still shocking to see it happen so early in the movie.Following the first attack Rob receives a voice mail message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment across town and Rob sets of to rescue her along with his friends. Not since Lord of The Rings have a small group of people out walking suffered so much drama, heartache and action - and it was great fun to watch.Once you get used to the hand held, unsteady movements of the camera it really added to the panic and chaos. We saw the explosions, monsters (the big one and the small ones) and action from the point of the characters, who were usually running in the opposite direction. This added to the tension and excitement as you were only really seeing snippets of what was really happening in the city - we pass by ambulance crews working on the injured and a mass army operation complete with tanks and loud explosions, but these are only in the background as the main focus remains on our small group of characters reaching Beth's apartment What makes the action work is the fact that the characters are just normal everyday people - they do not produce shotguns or start quipping witty one liners at the danger. They are running for their lives in terror and again this works so well with the unsteady camera - there are no slow-mo Michael Bay money shots in this film!! There are some very memorable scenes such as turning on the night vision in the underground tunnels - even though you knew what was obviously going to happen it was still scary, the death scene in the tent in the army base - I am still not sure what actually happened but I know that it was gross and the helicopter evacuation.I am not intelligent enough to think of a clever and thought provoking metaphor for the monster attacking New York as that is it not why I go to the movies - I go to be entertained and I left the cinema feeling buzzed, excited and thoroughly entertained by Cloverfield and because of this I would give it 10/10.My only grip would be asking why the characters walked everywhere - I would've stolen one of the many cars that were abandoned about the streets of NYC - but then again I suppose that it is easy to be critical when you are sitting in the safety of a cinema screen and not running for your life",10,2,3,17 February 2008
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Sweeney Todd - a cut above the rest?
","There is nothing better than seeing a good musical on the big screen and Sweeney Todd does not disappoint.All the usual Tim Burton boxes are ticked - dark gloomy atmosphere, eccentric characters, Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp. The only box left un-ticked is Danny Elfman.I'm one of the few people who cannot see the attraction with Johnny Depp, I never bought into the Captain Jack hype or liked his version of Willy Wonka but Sweeney Todd is the first film I have seen Johnny Depp in and have been completely immersed in his performance. His singing, whilst very good, is not on par with other Hollywood stars such as Hugh Jackman or Ewan McGregor but his performance cannot be faulted he embodies Sweeney to the point that you forget that it Johnny Depp playing a character. The rest of the cast - Alan Rickman plays his usual villain - only this time he sings, Sacha Baron Cohan plays his usual crazed European - only this time he sings, Timothy Spall plays his usual villain lackey - only this time he sings, whilst clearly all playing roles they are famous for are good additions to the production, Sacha Baron Cohan getting a few good laughs,especially with a surprise accent related revelation!It is Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Sanders who steal the show. Helena is perfectly cast, regardless of her relationship with the director and all the big dramatic songs are left for young Sanders who will be compared to the Artful Dodger and for all the right reasons.There is a little sub-plot involving Sweeney's daughter Johanna (Jayne Wiesner) and a young sailor Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower) but they get rather short changed and are given little to do.The songs are all fittingly dark set against the geographically incorrect but appropriately gloomy London. Although none of the songs have the catchiness you would expect from musicals they are clever - special mention must go to Worst Pies in London, A Little Priest (personal favourite) and Pirelli's Miracle Elixir.The film looks gorgeous, with the colour all faded it illuminates the blood, and to be frank there is a lot of blood. The film is quite violent but once you get over the first initial graphically killing you accept the over-dramatic blood splattering. Overall I would give the film 9/10. It is a very enjoyable film which doesn't have a happy cast sing-a-long ala Hairspray at the end which fits in perfectly with the films gloomy tone. It loses a point for the wasted romantic sub-plot between Johanna and Anthony - Johanna getting the award for worst singer and song in the whole movie with Green Finch and Linnett Bird.Definitely recommended for all fans of Tim Burton, musicals and dare I say it, even the legions of Johnny Depp fans through out the world - although this one is still not a convert.",8,1,3,20 January 2008
Ocean's Thirteen," Unlucky 13 - I don't think so
","I loved Oceans 11 when it was released. It was slick, funny, entertaining, had a fantastic original script and had a huge A list cast.I hated Oceans 12. It had all the things mentioned above with the addition of Catherine Zeta Jones and an embarrassing Bruce Willis cameo. The problems with Oceans 12 is that it had all the ingredients as Oceans 11 but got so caught up in its on self importance and fame and ultimately became so bloated with stars and in jokes it became a mess.I didn't want to see Oceans 13 but after some promising reviews and good trailers, there I was on opening night.Gone are Catherine Zeta Jones and Julia Roberts as Oceans 13 was not their fight. This was the correct decision, their inclusion in the movie would have been unnecessary.Plot Not overly complicated. Reuben gets screwed around by Bank over the opening of a new casino so Danny, Rusty and the gang vow to get revenge by ruining Bank financially and so it begins.They set out to ruin opening night by fixing all the machines etc to pay out big money. Their plan is foiled by the discovery of a computer inside the casino that can tell if you are cheating or if you know that you are going to win. This is a nice touch and it was fun and interesting to watch how the gang would get around this problem - although there was never any doubt that they would.Cast All of the original 11 had returned. They are a great ensemble cast and all work so well together. This time we get even more of Turk and Virgil (my favs) and even less of Bernie Mac so I was happy. Virgils trip to Mexico to rig the dices as they were being made only to start a protest and get the factory shut down was funny, was made even funnier by Turk going to sort him out and joining in the riot. Virgil and Turk are so great - they should have their own spin off! lolYou can tell the Damon, Clooney and Pitt are all buddies in real life they all just work so well together.It was a nice touch that in scenes with just Clooney and Pitt we cut to them in mid conversation which turned out to be pretty funny as we had no idea what they were on about!Ellen Barkin was OK in the role she was given. - nothing much to say about her role at all.Matt Damons nose was great and it was apparently not a prop for props sake. Apparently a big nose is still good for a few laughs in today's sophisticated age!! A little cameo from his characters father at the end was a nice touchTerry Benidicate was back in a small role which was nice as he is a fun character. Seeing him on Oprah - a long running joke through the film was funny!Best Line This would have to go to Rueben. I cannot remember the full line which I am really annoyed at, but when he is in bed speaking for the first time and he gives of a list of comments and ends with 'Linus crying' = very funnyHonourable mention must go to Turk and Virgil Turk - Is it in yet? Virgil - I hate that question!Payoff There was never any doubt that Oceans11 were going were going to succeed in their plan but watching them pull it of was a fun journey!Overall This film was so much better than Oceans 12. I am glad that they left out CJZ and J.R, but I am not saying that they are the reason for Oceans 12 being the weakest of the three no no no .I would give it 7/10. It loses a two points for being the third movie (one point lost for each sequel). This is because Oceans 11 was never meant to be a franchise - Oceans 11 wasn't made with sequel in mind.It also loses a point for the cheesy in jokes at the end - Clooney telling Rusty to go have a couple of kids, Pitt telling Clooney not to put on so much weight in between and Damon for saying I will see you when I see you.There is a slight chance that we will see Oceans 14. It is necessary? No. It is needed ? No. Will I see it? Yes.",7,1,3,16 June 2007
Watchmen," Watch it
","After worries of legal battles and murmurings of delayed release dates Watchmen finally arrived on the 6th March but I will confess that up until one year I ago I had never heard of the Watchmen. It wasn't until I discovered that Jeffrey Dean Morgan was cast as The Comedian it caught my attention and forced me to read the graphic novel.I had never read a graphic novel before the Watchmen and thought I would struggle through it but I read it in a matter of days. I couldn't put it down. The initial excitement for JDM turned into genuine excitement for the movie itself and I was not disappointed.I absolutely loved everything about it. The characters were exactly how I imagined them to be. Jackie Earle Haley was superb as Rorschach, my favourite character in the novel. His story was the one I enjoyed reading about most and it transferred so well onto the big screen. If it had of been a Rorschach movie I would have been happy. The prison scene and Rorschach's back-story were my favourite parts of the book and also the best parts of the film One teeny tiny grumble (I feel that I should had at least one complaint) is that the first time I heard his narration I thought it was Christian Bale's Batman talking. The gravely voice sounded so similar but within one scene that was quickly forgotten about.The other characters were also very well played. Night Owl(2) (Patrick Wilson) and The Silk Spectre(2) (Malin Akerman) played well together on the big screen. I wasn't a big fan of Laurie's when reading the novel but I warmed to her in the movie version although the same cannot be said for Dr Manhattan. I totally understand the point of his character, I can see how he began to lose touch with humanity and I appreciate the irony of the only 'super' hero not wanting to get involved but there is something about the character that I just don't like. I really detested the conversation he and Laurie had on Mars in the novel and I disliked it just as much in the movie. The fact that he was constantly telling her 'you will go to Dan' or 'you will cry at the end of this conversation' really just angered me. He is just one of those characters that you come across at times that you just cannot warm to.There has been criticism of Matthew Goode being cast as Ozymandias, but once I just accepted that he wasn't that great at an American accent he was fine. As a Supernatural fan, of course seeing JDM play The Comedian was a major part of going to see the movie. He was awesome. The Comedian is has essentially all the ingredients for a super villain but by the end of the movie you cant help but like him. The rape and the Vietnam scenes were uncomfortable to read about and just as uncomfortable to watch. You know you have got a major bad-ass on screen when someone can fire a few rounds from a shotgun and not blink - JDM did just that in the riot scene on the streets of New York and I was very impressed.The action was also very good. Perhaps there wasn't as much action as some people were expecting but when it arrived it came with a bang - and it was very graphic in parts, especially one scene with a chainsaw that even Leatherface would have flinched at.The ending differed slightly from the book but I thought the movie ending was actually better and easier to understand but other than that it was faithful to the original text. Although it was left completely out of the movie Tales of the Black Freighter has been filmed and will be on the DVD and I am satisfied with that as it was almost as engaging as the main plot.I would give the movie 10/10. I had been waiting for the movie for months and when it arrived it did not disappoint on any level - even the soundtrack was awesome. I would recommend it to anyone but I would also suggest that you read the novel too.",10,2,7,7 March 2009
Knowing," Knowing - I wish I didn't (very spoilery)
","Watching the teaser trailer will pretty much sum up the entire plot for you, as is expected with all Nicolas Cage movies. Man find page with numbers. Numbers mean something. Man tries to find out what the problem is. Man is thought to be crazy. Man is correct - ha! to the doubters. Just swap 'page with numbers' to 'map' and you have the exact same synopsis for two of Cage's other blockbusters Knowing starts off with the most boring credit sequence in the history of film. Just names over a weird overly ominous score. We then get a bit of back-story as to the origins of the numbers. Turns out some creepy kid wrote them for a time capsule which will be dug up in fifty years. The children, whether they lived fifty years ago or in the present day were far to excited about the time capsule. If this was the movies version of reality then I knew I was in for a tough evening. Once the back-story finishes we were then treated to another boring credit sequence. This time we got the ominous score and the names going over what looked like someone messing about on Google Earth with a dodgy internet connection.We are introduced to Cages character John and his son Caleb. Cage apparently lectures at MIT but he, his class and the audience have no clue what he is rambling on about. The only thing that is clear is that EveRy SinGle SyllABle Must BE ProNounced when he teaches. At home he and his son are dealing with the upsetting loss of their wife and mother who has be deceased for almost a year - long enough for wallpaper to peal of the walls, the garden to become overgrown and the house to decay at a rapid pace. Its clear who took care of the upkeep and maintenance of Casa De Cage.The film maker doesn't drag out the time capsule story for too long and this I honestly thank him for. Caleb gets the page with the numbers and John finds the page and within seconds sees that the numbers are predicting all major disasters from the last fifty years. If you think it appears ridiculous reading that you should see the scene where John has to explain it to his MIT colleagueThe plot as awful moves on and we meet Diane and her daughter Abbie, who like Caleb is beginning to hear whispers. They serve no purpose plot wise whatsoever although Rose Byrne does get praise for the most hysterical performance of the year so far - she was one frantic cry away from 'wont somebody please think of the children'. Whilst all the number excitement is going on there are four weird guys, who can only be described as the Pet Shop Boys and Spike from Buffy's strange love children, are stalking John and his son. They are creepy for the first few times we see them but then their constant staring and seriousness becomes unintentionally funny.They finally kidnap the two kids and we are all grateful as we realise we are heading towards the end. We follow John as he chases after them into an overgrown wood, he calls frantically for the return of the his son, who appears out of nowhere holding a big white bunny. . Turns out the four 'Spike Shop Boys' gave him the bunny as a gift and they are all going with them to be safe. I forgot to mention that the sun is going to flare out and kill us all. That is the last thing that the numbers predicted. Anyway it turns out John cant go as he cant hear the whispers. Then all of a sudden a big spaceship appears, the four guys literally melt into green aliens and as Nicolas Cage drops to his knees in an over dramatic fashion in disbelief the audience nearly starts to cry along with him. The four aliens, who have very obvious Angel Wing type shadows, two kids and two bunnies all go off into space as the earth dies, taking poor John along with it.We do get a 'nice after earth is destroyed' scene with the two kids in white clothes running through a CGI corn field towards a big CGI tree which I am assuming is supposed to represent the tree in the Garden of Eden. Or something. By that stage I think I slipped into shock at the sudden, and unexpected introduction of aliens.The movie was awful. The entire cast was awful. The acting was awful. The script was awful. I want to meet the person who wrote the alien ending, shake him by the neck and as 'Why?' I will admit though that the two set pieces - the plane crash and the subway crash, both of which used the ever-present threat or terrorism to cheaply were actually quite good. We were also treated to some fantastic Cage overacting during the crashes and him trying to emote afterwards which almost makes it worth it.I would give the movie 3/10. It gets the points for the two set pieces. It loses the rest of the points for everything else being so awful. It has topped the box office and that is due to the appearance of Nicolas Cage - an actor who has been living on borrowed time, phoning in the same old performance for years now. Even playing the always fun game of watching his wig, his weird elbow powered run or his genuine inability to act isn't fun any more and that is the saddest thing about the whole movie.One thing that will keep me awake at night is the bunnies! What is the significance of the bunnies?!",3,10,19,29 March 2009
Disturbia," Disturbia in American Suburbia
","Disturbia topped the US box office for three weeks and although that is not a marker for the quality of a film I was excited when the UK release finally arrived.After the death of his father in a car crash Kale (Shia LaBeouf) goes from the happy suburban kid with no worries to a withdrawn, hoodie wearing emo and after failing a Spanish test he punches his teacher and is sentenced to three months house arrest, wherein he fills his time by spying on the neighbours; from a man having an affair, to the cute blond swimming in a very skimpy bikini.Kale, along with his friend Ronnie and the bikini girl Ashley begin to spy on the standard creepy neighbour with murderous tendencies and so the chase begins between the practically unstoppable killer and pretty teens.It takes Disturbia a while to get going, with a few false starts and cheap scares but once chase starts it does become engrossing to watch, and thankfully the film doesn't head down the oh so fashionable but extremely un-entertaining 'gorno' route.All the cast are fine - especially the comic sidekick Ronnie, who has more lives than a cat.David Morse, who plays Mr Turner, is very creepy and is very believable as a Hollywood Killer.Shia LaBeouf, with his natural charm and likability continues to make a name for himself as a upcoming star and has the ability to carry a film on his own. In Hollywood action films there is usually a scene where the main character, for example, Will Smith stands in a tight tee-shirt and cocks his gun as he prepares for the final battle, and in Disturbia we have the nerdy, but strangely cute Shia LaBeouf cocking a pair of garden shears. It was just a short scene but I thought it was a nice touch.Overall Disturbia isn't exactly ground breaking and there are no surprises as to how the film ends but it is fun to watch so I would give it a 8/10. It loses a point for the bikini scenes (how many times a week does that girl go swimming? And more importantly where the hell did she disappear to during the final showdown?) and also loses a point for all the product placement i.e. Apple and Xbox should have been credited as co-stars.Overall Disturbia is nothing new - but then again I suppose If it isn't broke don't fix it.",8,1,2,16 September 2007
Monsters vs. Aliens," Monsters v Aliens
","A long time ago in a land far far away, well the year 2001 to be precise Shrek arrived and set the benchmark for modern day animation. Shrek had the one thing that many other children's films did not have - the adult factor and because of this a franchise was spawned that peaked at Shrek2 and died an undignified death at Shrek the Third. Every animated movie since the release of Shrek has desperately tried to gain adult acceptance as that is were the true money lies and on the Easter Weekend we were treated to Monsters v Aliens.It stars the usual big Hollywood names in the trendy fashion that is voicing a CGI kids film. This time we had the talents of Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogan (who is more than everywhere these days), a British Huge Laurie as the Monsters and Keifer Sutherland hamming it up voice style as General Monger. I don't know what it was, maybe because I actually liked the actors voicing the characters but I thought they were all great. Reese Witherspoon did a great job as Susan (Ginormica) and Seth Rogan is apparently just as funny doing voice work (and gaining most of the laughs) as the literally brainless B.O.B.The story is as basic as it gets. Monsters are imprisoned. Aliens attack. Monsters fight Aliens and are accepted into the world. Although the story is basic that isn't a criticism. It was simple enough for the young kids to follow but it is the telling of the story and all the little side scenes such as those involving the President of America and all the daft clich√©s were for the adults.The animation was fantastic to look at. It had all the polish of Pixar without the over smaltzy Disneyness that usually accompanies it and was just as funny as the rough and ready Ice Age series (which in my view outranks Shrek any day of the week!) There were some very funny set pieces and the action was fast and exciting. There was nothing to scary for very young children but there is enough action that the older kids (and adults!) will be impressed by. I will admit to laughing out loud on more that once occasion especially at the 'global warming - convenient truth' quip that no body else in the audience seemed to pick up on.I would give the movie 8/10. It is an animated movie that you can actually volunteer to take your kids to and enjoy it just as much as they can. There probably will be a sequel but if you look at Shrek (again) the second one is always better!!",8,1,3,14 April 2009
Enchanted," Enchanted - you will be
","I grew up with Disney movies. I am now 22 and still love them so when I heard of Enchanted I couldn't help but be excited.It is just a fantastic movie - it took all the usual Disney clich√É¬©s which work in their own wonderful way in cartoon form such as signing beauties, dashing princes, housework loving animals and introduced them to the real world of people.I loved the little shout outs to the Disney classics, such as Giselle appearing in the bubbles as she was cleaning the floor and the chandelier moment during the ballroom dance.The cast were fantastic - Amy Adams and James Marsden just went for it and gave it their all. I do think that James Marsden stole the show from everybody. It was fun to watch Patrick Dempsey's stern lawyer finally give into the fairy tale happy life that Giselle lived by, however I do think that Susan Sarandon was under used as the wicked step-mother and she could do very little with the character with her very limited scene time.What made the movie great was Disney making fun of itself. It if had of been another company making fun of Disney it wouldn't have worked just as well.This is a very limited review but I would give the movie 10/10. I haven't enjoyed a film as much at the cinema in a long time - it was fun, happy, colourful - everything you would expect from a Disney movie - Kids will love the film for what it is and adults will appreciate the irony. A thoroughly enjoyable movie all round",10,2,3,20 December 2007
Twilight," Twilight - has lost its shimmer
","2008 marked, what feels like the first Christmas in ages without a Harry Potter movie, and this year we were treated to the launch of another novelised franchise -Twilight.Twilight focuses on the romantic relationship between a seventeen year old girl Bella and her complicated boyfriend Edward Cullen - the complication being that Edward is in fact a vampire, albeit a 'vegetarian' vampire.A lot of the dialogue was lifted straight from Meyers novel and did not make a successful translation from page to screen and a lot of the intimate scenes between Bella and Edward were just clunky and awkward. The scene in the science lab were both characters meet each other for the first time looked clich√©d and amateurish. There was just to much melodrama for me - even the piano score was a bit to much.The special effects look cheap and nasty. They would have just been better not showing Edward running through the trees or the director should have watched some wushu movies just to at least get the impression of running through the trees correct and don't get me started on Edwards twinkling skin.The most entertaining part of the whole movie was the actual Cullen Family, who, as they did in the book, have a much greater presence than the two main characters, and unfortunately, as in the book, their screen time is very limited.Overall the movie was OK - I liked the book much better, although, after the second book in the series I gave up because I was bored¬Ö¬Ö I would give Twilight 6/10. If you haven't read the book or heard of Edward Cullen before you go then avoid at all costs as the awkward dialogue, terrible effects and teen romance will make you cringe with embarrassment. Twilight is best watched and appreciated by those who already love it.",6,1,3,20 December 2008
Ghost Rider," Smoldering Fire
","DISCLAIMER - For the record I know less than nothing about the Ghost Rider comics, so my opinions (for the little that they are worth) are from a movie fan only I was looking forward to Ghost Rider since I saw the trailer but as it got closer and closer to its release my interest in the film had completely gone, which is unusual for me as I usually enjoy Marvel movies.Anyway, after the FF2 trailer and the full trailer for the 300 the night began to pick up.... that was until young Johnny Blaze said his first lines. He was just a bad actor all round. There was one scene were he laughed at the devil and it was just embarrassing to watch!! The young Eva Mendes character was cast by the looks of it because she looked exactly like the real Eva Mendes! They just weren't anything special and after the first 10 minutes i was beginning to get really worried.Before we go on it is important to note that I do not see the attraction with Nic Cage, I have only ever seen Gone in 60 Seconds, Face Off (free with my first DVD player) and National Treasure and he was OK it all three. I know he is an Oscar winner but to be honest that means jack all when you take into account some of the actors that have one the award over the years. There was a scene were he was watching TV and was pointing and laughing at a monkey karate chopping a brick and that was so awful to watch..... The few attempts of the Cage sarcastic humour were few and far between and even then they were poorly written, although the scene were Johnny was following the camera van was amusing. The camera guy survived though - that is unusual. I just didn't like the daytime TV watching Carpenter loving side of the Rider I do not know what age Johnny Blaze is but Nic Cage was just to old. It is tempting to insert a remark about the wig but it pretty much speaks for itself, you can see the wig and its two assistants credited at the end of the movie. He also had teeth so perfect i think that they were CGI and there was one shot (the lets show off my body scene) where i swear to God i thought that a body had been photo shopped in it was so toned and tanned.Eva Mendes was OK. nothing to say about her really apart from the fact that she had a really fantastic push up bra on throughout the movie..The chubby sidekick, who was also the side kick in Just Like Heaven was OK. Was surprised that he got killed in the end, then I remembered he was the chubby side kick so he was pretty much screwed from the get go......The baddies were cool though. I liked the fire, air, water and earth thing that they had going on. I liked how it was an unofficial rule that they all had to wear long coats!! There was a fantastic dramatic pause between No Heart and his 'father' when they were having their conversation. The fact that the devil was No Hearts father was supposed to be a great revelation but there was a definite giggle amongst the audience There is no denying that the film picked up when the action started. When he became the Rider is when the movie really started and you could feel the movie suffer whenever he changed back into normal mode. The action was good, and I will admit i got quite engrossed during the final battle.I liked how the line 'I'll fight fire with fire' was kept for the very end. He meant it in a metaphorical sense and a literal sense. The line had so many meanings on many different levels its writing at its finest. Honourable mention must also go to the 'I haven't got a sole but I've got spirit' line.The most memorable scene for me was when Blaze and the old Rider were making there way out to the town for the final battle. I just looked amazing the two of them riding out together. It was honestly spoiled for me when it was revealed that it was the old Riders last ride. He used it up, turned his horse around and rode off home and out of the movie. Clearly he didn't want to help out and die in a blaze of glory in the final battle.Overall the movie was verging on the so bad is it actually good mark. I would give it a 6/10. Entertaining movie, not great on any level. It is def one for the cinema as it needed the dramatic big screen to help make it watchable. I honestly think if I had waited and rented it I would not have watched it the whole way through. I would have got 5/10 if not for the fantastic remix of Ghostriders in the Sky during the end credits!",5,4,8,9 April 2007
I Am Legend," A Legend In The Making?
","I had been looking forward to this movie since the trailer and the more I heard about it the more I wanted to see it.The movie starts of with Robert Neville (Will Smith) hunting dear in a deserted, desolate New York (a sight that is always unnerving to see). It was a fantastic opening to the movie as we get to see New York, the city that doesn't sleep, in such a scary state and from thereon we learn that Emma Thompson found a cure for cancer some years earlier which caused the outbreak of a deadly disease almost wiping out mankind - with the exception of Will Smith.There are few actors who can literally carry a film on their own so whether you like or loath him you have to admit that Will Smith is one of those actors who can achieve this (can you imagine if Tom Cruise played Robert Neville??) There are some very tense scenes such as when Sam runs into the building and one very sad death scene which will take you by surprise about how much you care for this little character but overall the anticipation and build up was all for nothing when you actually get to see the 'vampires'.They all looked like Imhotep from The Mummy Returns before he became fully human. It is a fine example of CGI ruining a film - I honestly think that if the 'vampires' were played by real people they would have been scarier and much more believable.There were a few parts of the film that really annoyed me - Will Smith must have it written into his contract that he must have the coolest car known to man in all of his movies. Driving full throttle down deserted New York in a Ford GT looked cool but completely out of place. Why did Anna and Ethan swing by New York on their way to Vermont? I'm not a geography expert but did they swim across the river to New York on the way? Neville claimed that the 'Vampires' had now lost all recognisable signs of human behaviour yet they were clearly following a leader (Imhotep), and were capable of mimicking Neville's own trap and capturing him. I actually thought at one stage that the leader was P'd of that Neville was testing the cure out on his girlfriend and had come to rescue her! Overall though it was an entertaining film and I would give it a 7/10. I loses a point for being a remake, a point of the Ford GT in New York and a point for the disappointing look of the 'vampires'.Go and see the movie and allow yourself to get caught up in it but if you are like me you will spend the whole movie waiting for one of those mannequins to move their heads - now that would make for a scary film!",7,0,1,30 December 2007
Shrek the Third," 3rd Times a Charm - or is it?
","A few years ago we got Shrek - the anti fairy tale hero and a movie that made fun of the fairy tales and concepts that Disney has spewed out over the years and as a result we got a fresh, fun and quirky children's film which had some great adult humour too. A sequel followed and who didn't fall in love with Puss in Boots? 2007 is the year of the trilogy and after the letdown of SM3 and POTC3 it is now Shreks turn to attempt an adequate 3rd helping.Did it succeed? - I just don't know. Not exactly a committed statement from someone who is attempting to review the movie, but I cant figure out if it was good or as good as its predecessors.The cast were all back and the voices all great as usual - no real qualms there.The plot - The King dies (in a very funny scene!) and leaves Shrek the new King unless he can persuade a young Arthur, a relative of the Kings to take the throne. Whilst Shrek is off on his quest to persuade Artie to become the new King of Far Far Away Charming enlists the help of the villains and losers of fairytale lore and invades the Kingdom determined that they, for a change, should be the ones to have a happy ending - and to put the icing on the cake - Fiona is pregnant! As usual Pinocchio, Gingy, The Three Pigs and the Wolf are all back to help and are as amusing as they have ever been.There are some very amusing scenes with Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, who in all honesty were much much funnier than Donkey and Puss. More screen time with them would've been greatly appreciated. I hated Snow White when I was a kid but after seeing her turn all bad ass and sing the Immigrant Song I have changed my opinion.Artie also had some fun scenes - the overacting scene was very funny!! It was actually Prince Charming who stole the whole show with his very evil, yet also very camp plan to kill Shrek during a play he and the other villains were performing. It was all a bit odd but still amusing non the less.I felt that Donkey and Puss were a little underused and that the inevitable body swapping storey arc was thrown in at the last minute. It wasn't that funny, or to be honest necessary.I thought that there were less fart and poop jokes than usual but they were saved until the end of the movie for Shrek and Donkeys kids and lets not forget Shreks 'poop speech' This brought a huge wave of silence as those types of jokes stopped being funny a long time ago - and I went to a Sunday afternoon matin√©e! I did laugh at parts though and there were some genuinely funny and clever scenes don't get me wrong but it just felt that something was missing.As usual the soundtrack was fun with some good songs on there - not overly convinced by Fergies version of Barracuda but that's a minor issue.Overall I would give it 7/10. It loses a point automatically for being a sequel (personal rule), losses another for the under use of Fiona, Puss and Donkey and a final point for the very unfunny body swapping idea.Kids will love it of course, but the magic and spark that attracted adults attention in the first one has definitely gone. It will make millions at the box office and even more in toy and game sales but lets have Shrek end on a reasonable high. It wasn't as much of a let down as some the threequels we have had this year but the franchise has all but run out of steam. Lets just have the Puss in Boots spin off to create some freshness to a very good franchise .",7,4,5,8 July 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Fantastic Sequel
","For the record I realise that FF:ROTSS was not pretending or trying to be a serious, thought provoking film with subtle digs at the war in Iraq or the collapse of todays modern society. It wanted to be a fun, entertaining family summer movie and that is exactly what it was. The cast all play well of each other. This time around there seemed to be more Ben and Johnny, which was great for comedy value. The 'rock slide' line had the audience (pretty much sold out) in stitches and it was really good to see the fun side of Ben. Ben seemed much more relaxed and had accepted his new lifestyle and powers 2nd time around. Bens relationship with Alicia was cute, I'm glad we got to see a bit more of her. As much as I liked The Thing in the first film, he really shone in the second one and I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed it when he was on screen. Reed was still as nerdy as ever. He took charge more this time around and was more of a team leader His speech were he tore shreds of the General was great fun to watch and yes I was so hot for him right then There had been a lot of bad vibes surround Jessica Alba as Sue, but I thought that they were unjustified. She never is going to be a fantastic (no pun) actress but she was fine here. There were rumours of another Jessica Alba underwear shot but all I saw was her naked shoulder when she was lying on the pavement unless of course I blinked and missed it. Her hair was OK. Her hair was not OK during the Japanese wedding scene. I didn't like the style. At least it will give all the hair haters some ammunition. I didn't quite know what to make of Johnny, at times I felt quite sympathetic towards him like when Reed shouted at him for almost getting every body killed and other times he came across as bratty. He still got all the fun lines through and he still was my favourite. He almost stole the show again but Ben and him were equal and his scenes with Sue were much better. The dad would be proud hug at the first wedding in the movie was sweet. I don't get Doom at all. I'm not experienced with the Fantastic Four comics but he is just a real weedy villain in this movie. Anyway Doom stole the board and got his butt kicked by Johnny and fell into a river never to be spoken of again. I'm sure he will be even more p'd off and turn up in the third one for even less screen time. The SS looked great and there is no denying that. The voice was fine. Some more action involving the SS would have been nice.We saw an awful lot of what he could do in the trailers so I felt a little bit let down with what screen time he actually got. The chase scene with Johnny seemed shorter in the film when I actually thought this scene would have been longer. I don't quite understand how he stopped Galactus and saved the world - but it looked good anyway and I've heard that it is all set up nicely for a SS spin off. We got a few snippets of back storey from SS but some more detail would have been nice. Alicia is a great character. I like the way she can completely see through Johnny and I hope that they keep Alicia and Bens relationship going into the next film. The General acted annoyed all through the movie and i enjoyed him being taken down a few pegs by Reed and had not much sympathy for him when he got fried by Doom. Surely if had the experience and intelligence to be a General in the United States army he could see right through Dooms oh so obvious evil scheme. He clearly didn't read the internal email about Doom being evil! The plot wasn't exactly taxing but it didn't matter as on the whole it seemed to be wrapped up nicely in the end complete with oriental wedding with the same Minister showing up in Japan - which was pretty funny! It was perhaps a bit to convenient that Doom woke up just as the SS arrived but that's timing for you. If Doom had the means and ability to speak to the SS face to face could he not have figured out how to knock him of his board by himself? How did Doom know where to meet the Surfer. The whole part with Doom joining the good guys just did not work for me at all. I was never sure about the Fantasticar as it always seemed cheesy to me but I am so glad I was proved wrong. The flying scenes were great to watch especially when it split into three parts! Johnny taking on everyone's powers looked cool. I don't understand how he managed to have all four powers at once but it doesn't really matter and his fight with Dooms was definitely the best in the movie. I thought that it was a bit on the short side though. Overall it was how all sequels should be - more action, more comedy and made on a grander scale! It set out what it intended to do very well I would give it 8 out of 10. It loses a point automatically for being a sequel and it losses another point for the whole Doom joining up with the General to capture the Surfer. I just didn't buy that at all. There will be haters of that movie, many of whom hated the movie before they even saw it, but it is definitely a solid, fun family movie!",8,2,5,16 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Curiously engaging
","I will confess that when I first watched the trailer I didn't get it. I didn't really understand what the movie was about. It wasn't until the third or forth time that I viewed the trailer something clicked and made this one movie I had to see.This was very much a movie about story over performance. I am not a huge Brad Pitt fan, I don't find him particularly talented or, on a more shallow basis attractive, but once you got used to his wavering accent you could become totally absorbed in Benjamin's story.The transformation of Benjamin ranging from his elderly form right down to his younger appearance was amazing to watch. The special effects were seamless. It was hard to point out the stage in the movie where the real Brad Pitt appeared.The supporting cast were fine, the most light-hearted moments came from Taraji P Henson as Benjamin's adopted mother Queenie and Jared Harris as Caption Mike although there is the argument that both roles were playing caricatures and as ever , Cate Blanchett played her part with the usual talent and grace that we have come to expect.Benjamin Button is the nicest and most polite character to have appeared on the big screen since Forest Gump and at times he did come across like Forest with his naive simplicity. Cate Blanchett had the harder job of getting the audiences sympathy as there were times when Daisy was just down right horrid to poor (simple) Benjamin but come the end of her story she had won me around.There were moments were I felt tears welling up and these were mostly the hospital scenes, that at times, interrupted the story telling, as the virtually unrecognisable Cate Blanchett was almost to accurate in her portrayal of a cancer patient.I would give the movie an 8/10. It was a movie that you could totally lose yourself in - you do not feel the long running time.I felt it had to lose a point for the Hurricane Katrina references at the end. It was a nice idea that Benjamin would return for Daisy but if we buy that ending then we really must blame Benjamin for creating one of the worst hurricanes in recent times. The ending could have worked but tying it into a recent real life event just didn't. It was clumsily done.I loses as other point as I am Irish and Captain Mike annoyed me as I don't actually know of any Irish Men who speak in that accent.Overall it is a love story about two people meeting at different stages of their lives and trying to hold on to the time they have together . -aww",8,0,2,1 March 2009
Transformers," Transforming the Box Office
","I had been looking forward to the Transformers ever since the teaser trailer was released and in this bloated summer of sequels I was looking forward to seeing something new - Transformers completely passed my by when I was growing up!CAST & CHARACTERS: The cast were fine - Shia LeBeouf an actor whose career status is definitely rising was very good in his role and had some fine comedy moments as did Kevin Dunn and Judy White, who played his parents. Josh Duhamel & Tyrese Gibson were fine as the obligatory one dimensional soldiers - the fact that Captain Lennox has a baby daughter is as much character development that we got. John Voights Defence Secretary just seemed to fall apart towards the end and lost all sense of order and control. John Turturro played the oh so clich√©d secret agent and a really strange way. Shia LeBeouf asked his character if he was on drugs and by that stage I was also wondering the same thing. Megan Fox has got to be one of the worst actresses on the history of the planet - a very very attractive actress also a very very untalented one. There was an actual attempt of character development in the fact that she had a criminal record for stealing cars and this proved very useful later on in the movie Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson were two very unlikely code breakers. Then don't forget the, almost comes as standard Bernie Mac cameo. The man is not funny people. I cannot think why this man is in movies.PLOT: I do understand how Michael Bay films work plot wise -we get one line of sensible dialogue for about ten explosions. We are introduced to Sam Witwicky giving a report on his great great grandfather who went exploring in the Artic Circle and stumbled across Megatron frozen in the snow. Many years later Sam is selling glasses that his grandfather wore to the Artic on EBay, one of the many subtle product placings in the movie. But really, lets be honest with ourselves - who came to see Transformers for plot?? I didn't for one - I came to see an action movie were big super intelligent robots come to earth: some are there to help and some are there to destroy. There was a mention of finding a big cube at various stages. I did notice a mocking dig at George Bush as the President on AirForce1 but it was all a bit unnecessary ACTION: In a Michael Bay movie it's action that matters and not plot and here we got plenty of it. Plenty of explosions, action and thrills to satisfy even the most hardened Michael Bay fan. It was just loud and unsubtle and to be honest it was great!THE TRANSFORMERS When the Autobots were on screen the movie really picked up. Each had their own personality and style. The scene were they were all in the Witwicky garden was very funny - silly but still funny. We were all so into the movie that when Bumblebee got attacked by the humans I was grabbed by a friend and told to 'do something!!' and when Jazz got killed the whole audience was devastated. The Decepticons, all complete with silly names such as the Destructor and BoneCrusher, actually all transformed into cooler vehicles than the Autobots, but were never going to win. Megatron actually got the biggest laugh when he flicked away a human in disgust. The fact that the Transformers could feel pain and could get hurt seemed to make them seem more human - and made you care for them further, especially since they all had human like eyesPLOT HOLES There were some: What happened to the group who stayed at the Hover Dam? Maggie, Glen, Agent Simmons and the Defence Secretary? Are they still there now? We seemed to forget about them at the end. Why would it be helpful to send Shia LeBeouf off to a helicopter to get the cube to safety? Surely Megatron would just blow it - and low and behold he did!! Why did Optimus Prime tell us that the Autobots were all hiding yet, there he was standing as bold as brass on top of a big hill? Plot holes yet - but do they really matter in the long run? NoOVERALL I was not disappointed. I knew I was going into a Michael Bay film and I knew what to expect. There will be many people who will automatically hate it because of Michael Bay and will criticise all the explosions and noise, but they seriously need to get over themselves and just enjoy a summer action movie for what it is without looking for a deeper meaning. I didn't care that the characters were a bit clich√©d and one dimensional. I didn't care about all the product placement - A Nokia cameo is almost as expected as a Bernie Mac one these days and who doesn't want the new Camaro? I would give it an 8/10. It loses a point for Megan Fox and Bernie Mac and it loses another for the few plot holes that were scattered about the film. Transformers should be seen in the cinema so it can be enjoyed at maximum effect. It deserves credit at least for not being a sequel in a summer full of threequels (I know there were cartoon movies made before this one!). Is a Transformers 2 needed ?¬Ö.erm no. Will I see it?¬Ö¬Öyep!!",8,14,25,29 July 2007
Taken," Taken
","At the age of 56 Liam Neeson oddly decided to take the lead role in an action movie. My first thoughts after seeing the trailer were accurately along the lines of 'What the hell - did Clive Owen not answer his phone on casting day?' but alas here we are.I don't know why Liam Neeson as an action star confused me, after all this is the guy, who in a single montage, trained Orlando Bloom to save the people of Jerusalem from the mighty Saladin, trained Obi Wan Kenobi and hell he even trained what is now the only credible Batman, so I suppose you have to give the man the benefit of the doubt that he can hold his own in the fight against evil Albanians.Plot: Liam Neesons 17 year old daughter goes to France and gets herself kidnapped before she even unpacks her beret and The Neeson single handily sets out to bring her back - at what ever the costs (ohh he is so intimidating with his perma-frown!) A few keys points about the things I learnt have from Taken: Don't stand in the middle of a busy motor-way and look smug - you only have your own self to blame when it ends messily.All Americans, or those who pretend to be American are good.If you want to blend in when in France brown bags and long bread sticks are the way to do that.Liam Neeson actually has the force which is how he was able to sense how, when and who took his daughter by simply just walking around her apartment.The Neeson can outrun a 2008 Audi.All foreigners, or those who pretend to be foreigners are evil.Just by calling yourself Jean-Claude you can in fact fool the half of France and the evil foreign Albanians that you are a fact a French citizen even though you are an American with a thick Northern Irish accent who speaks only English.Don't get me wrong the movie was very entertaining but the vast majority of the laughs were unintentional. There was also something very unsettling about the 'shopping for girls' scene as it was so dehumanised.There was one question though that were left unanswered: How in the hell can they justify casting Maggie Grace as a 17 year old? Four years ago she was playing an 18 year old on Lost and here were at the end of 2008 and she has de-aged yet again and don't get me started on her run - she makes Phoebe from Friends run look elegant.It is a great action movie with some laughs. If you want to be entertained and just enjoy a silly action movie then this is the film for you - 7/10.If anything I feel privileged to contribute to The Liam Neeson Retirement Fund where he can now retire to the Green Green Grass of L.A.",7,0,3,11 October 2008
Drag Me to Hell," Dragged to Hell and back
","Sam Raimi has returned to his horror movie roots with Drag me to Hell, a movie staring Alison Lohman as Christine Brown and Justin Long as her college professor boyfriend, annoyingly named Clay. Christine finds herself playing the quiet, blonde, homely, formerly fat, farm girl now working in a bank role. As she is up for promotion Christine unwisely asserts her new found authority on an elderly woman who has fallen behind on her mortgage payments. Mrs Ganush, (a fantastic Lorna Raver) doesn't take to kindly to her eviction attacks Christine in the bank parking bay and puts a curse on her causing her to be literally dragged down to hell in three days time. It all seems quite run of the mill but Drag me to Hell is a horror movie that is actually intentionally funny. The fight between Mrs Ganush and Christine in the car is one of the most original and hysterically entertaining fights between two females ever to be shot.The plot moves on towards more conventional horror movie expectations and if you allow yourself to let go and enjoy the movie all the usual scares and jumps are there. What makes Drag me to Hell stand out is the fact that whilst the scares are happening and the tension is building the outcome is so purposefully full of black humour you cant help but laugh. All this is done without one drop of blood, with the exception of a scene in the bank which was more of a shout-out to past Raimi movies. The general trend in Hollywood is 'the more gore - the less scares' and Drag me to Hell used this formula in reverse so well.The s√©ance and graveyard scenes were so tense yet also so ridiculously bizarre (the talking goat to name but one!) you couldn't help but laugh through your fear.As with most movies you have to suspend disbelief and as a movie lover I do judge each movie on its own merit and take it for what it is but even my imagination will never be able to believe Justin Long is a professor of psychology. If I had to pick a fault in the movie then that would be it.I would thoroughly recommend Drag me to Hell. If the recent overindulgence of gorno doesn't do anything for you (it doesn't for me) then this is a solid return to supernatural horror. I would give it an 8/10.",8,1,4,30 May 2009
Defiance," Defying the odds?
","The first time I saw the trailer for this movie I was sold.The story takes place during WW2 in which three Polish brothers Tuvia Bielski (Daniel Craig), Zus (Leiv Schreiber) and Asael (Jamie Bell) escape the Nazi invasion of Poland by escaping to the vast forest of Belarus, along with various other escapees they meet along the way.The opening scenes of the movie were very uncomfortable to watch - they were in black and white and looked as if it were original footage from the 40's. I am to lazy to research whether or not it was, but they were effective as seeing prisoners getting shot at close range by the Nazi soldiers was very unsettling.After this we jump straight into the movie with Zus heading home with Asael only to find their parents killed and they escape to the forest with another younger brother and meet up with Tuvia. Here is where they decide to hide.Zus and Tuvia disagree about the growing number of refugees joining their group, which is growing at a rapid pace and eventually Zus leaves the Bielski group and joins the Russian Army who are stationed nearby.The three main characters are all very well cast. Jamie Bell is fine as the younger brother caught between his two older brothers while Craig and Schreiber play well against each other. Schreiber is actually the best actor in the whole movie - you actually would not be surprised if his character defeated the entire Nazi party on his own. This bodes extremely well for Wolverine which is released in May 2009!! The supporting cast unfortunately are not worth mentioning at all. They are all predicable bit players that lack complete originality. The old intellectual and the young intellectual who bicker constantly until a respectable friendship grows, the pretty girl, the feisty girl, the jerk, the pregnant one, the one who risks his life to save the main character etc, etc, etc.The Russian army made a few appearances and were the usual crazy, furry hat wearing, vodka drinking Russians that are usually portrayed in film. The most annoying thing about the Russian army is that they all spoke in Russian, a sure sign that a movie has a misguided view of its own brilliance, while the rest of the cast spoke in an Eastern European accents.The movie did play as very serious and rightly so but there was some brotherly bonding moments which added a few minutes of light hearted relief to proceedings.One scene that did not play well at all was Tuvia giving his 'going into battle outnumbered but we shall be victorious' speech on a pure white horse to a group of terrified weaponless villagers. The scene is very overused and here is was very out of place and ridiculously cheesy.The action when it appeared was quite brutal but it did not overshadow the story of the people living in Bielskis camp which was the main focus of the movie. The community struggling through the winter and their increasing desperation for food were uncomfortable to watch.I would give it an 7/10. It just lacked that extra special something that puts it up there with the great war movies. A good effort though in telling the untold story of a family that saved more Jewish refugees during WW2 that Schindler.",7,4,9,10 January 2009
1408," Checking out of 1408
","As a lover of movies there is nothing better than going to the cinema to see a good horror movie no matter what the sub genre is.Our main character in 1408 is Mike Enslin, played very well by John Cusack. Mike is a writer and after the tragic death of his daughter he leaves writing novels behind and creates his own, albeit, rather unsuccessful '10 Ten Most Haunted¬Ö' franchise.The movie starts of with Mike travelling to a haunted hotel to investigate whether or not it is actually haunted, but in no way does Mike actually believe in ghosts or actual hauntings.After a good 20mins Mike receives an anonymous postcard informing him about a mysterious and dangerous room at the Dolphin Hotel. Mike sets of to the hotel only to be informed by manager Samuel L Jackson, who is not playing a cop or bad ass mutha, that room 1408 is haunted and that many of his clients have died unnatural deaths and ¬Ö¬Ö¬Ö.shock horror ¬Ö¬Ö.even natural deaths in that particular room.So off Mike goes to room 1408. Here it is were John Cusacks performance really shines. You have to bear in mind that four the next hour it is basically Mike alone reacting with the goings on.Instead of running around shrieking in a pair of hot pants as is the norm in modern horror movies, Mike tries to logically explain what is going on and how the staff of the Dolphin Hotel are trying to put the frighteners on him.Just when you think that the movie is all sewn up in a totally predictable way and we can go home for the night the twist comes, and I don't want to spoil anything in great detail but what I can say is that it is one of the biggest disappointments in movie history. The twist served no real purpose but to extend the movie for another thirty minutes and supply the audience with another inferior ending to wrap the movie up.There was no conclusion or explanation as to why the room was evil but I do know that if it was all sewn up there would be no need for a much inferior sequel staring a lesser known actor.There is no doubting that there were some jumpy moments throughout the movie, but someone quietly sneaking up behind you isn't really that scary.The movie was saved by John Cusack who went from a sarcastic unbeliever to a terrified wreak. Samuel L Jackson showed up to give us some background information and as it is probably written into all his contracts he provides the movies only 'F' word.The 1408 also wins an award for the most pointless CGI scene ever - who ever thought that the audience would need to see a special effect of someone turning a key in a door is very deluded.Don't get me wrong the 1408 is an OK movie and I would give it 7/10.It loses a point for Samuel L Jacksons use of the 'F' word, it was predictable and as much as I love Samuel L Jackson, he just wasn't believable as a hotel manager. It loses two points for the twist and the ending. I would rather they just ended it at the twist as the actual ending was just as predictable and to be honest boring.John Cusack did save the movie and it would be worth seeing it just for him - and this comes from someone who wouldn't call herself a huge Cusack fan.I would say to you - go and see the movie - it is entertaining but you will come of the cinema thinking that it could have ended so much better.",7,0,1,2 September 2007
Casino Royale," My First Bond
","I went to see James Bond last night. It was the first ever James Bond movie i had ever sat through - i did watch about 20mins of Goldeneye but turned it off in disgust as the wonderful Sean Bean was killed (only to be told the truth a few days later by my overly amused friends).I wasn't expecting much and i cant explain why. I will go and see anything in the cinema, i will watch and usually love any crap that Hollywood produces but for some reason James Bond did not appeal to me!!.Half the group wanted to go and the other half didn't. I didn't have a choice as i am still in the badbooks for making everyone go and see The Hills Have Eyes (best horror/remake of the year IMO).We decided not to prebook our tickets and leave it up to fate whether we got in or not. WE did of course and we where in our seats a mammoth 30mins (a record even for me) before it started, that is even after the usual drama of trying to work the pick&Mix and doing a quick toilet run.SO after a near perfect run with the trailers (Eragorn, 300 and Deja Vu) the film began.I can officially announce that James Bond wins the Neenee-b prize for the worst opening credits of the year. It was like a hippie playing poker on LSD in the 1960's. that is the only way to describe it.I do have to admit that the first 20mins with J.B chasing a guy with a bomb through a building site was fantastic - it was really well shot and the action and stunts where real looking which is what made it so good.After that to be honest it went down hill. There was a confusing story line about a poker game, with the villain being chased by another villain only for neither of those two villains to be the real villain. At the end i found it hard to figure out (or to care - 2 1/2 hour long movie people!!) who the main Bond Villain was.The poker playing scenes where good. I felt quite smug that i knew what they were doing and i was quite amusing when they kept panning over to the Bondgirl and the other guy and he kept telling her (but really the audience in an overly obvious manner) what was happening!! I must say that Bonds co-star was the sexiest, voluptuous most expensive looking co-star in movie history. I mean after seeing the Sony Ericson phone close up for about the millionth time i almost sprang up in my seat and ran out of the cinema to my nearest car phone warehouse in order to buy one. The product placement in the film so effective and subtly done(please note sarcasm!! lol) Daniel Craig was fine as Bond, and yes i did inhale quite sharply when he came our of the pool but the true star was the gorgeous Aston Martin DB9. If it was me that was driving i would have saved the car and not the bond girl. I think that a few of the audience members felt the same as after the car role there was a few gasps for the death of the car.Judi Dench was great as M, which so we have learnt is not a randomly assigned name - which sets us up nicely for M in her own super spy/grandmother type spin off movie!! I cant complain about the casting There were some amusing bits but weirdly the torture scene got the most laughs, but then again I'm from Ireland and we are all mad anyway.........It went a bit Titanic towards the end with all the nautical terror. The bit with the girl behind the metal gates i think was a scene stolen right out of Titanic - i have expected Kate Winslet floating by on a big door.Overall it was OK. From what I've been told it was the best Bond in years and i will take other peoples word for it. Daniel Craigs performance gets an 8/10 (he loses 1 point for climbing on board a movie franchise, enabling him to become world famous, have his own computer game and appear in many sequel and he loses another point for being upstaged by a car) The film for me gets a 7/10. It was a bit overlong as it refused to end but overall it was a much better to see my first James Bond film than sit through The Guardian!!!",7,1,3,18 November 2006
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard Lives Forever!
","Die Hard was released in 1988 and lets be honest it was and still is one of the best action movies out there, so of course some good, but albeit inferior sequels followed and nearly twenty years later we have the fourth Die Hard instalment.Was it needed? The answer simply - no.Was it worth the ¬£5.50 to see it? The answer simply - hell yeah! The action was non stop, fast paced, adrenaline pumping action. The set pieces were phenomenal. The tunnel scene was just amazing to watch. The fight scenes, especially the one between John and Mai was fantastic entertainment. The fighter jet -v- truck battle on the bridge was also very impressive.Bruce Willis may be the wrong side of 50, but the man still looks good in a tight tank top and can still throw some hard looking punches.Justin Long, a distant member of the Frat Pack, plays the nerdy side kick very well and has some very amusing lines, including one about a grazed knee and his asthma! Of all the actors in Hollywood I never would've picked him for this role but he was perfect.I was worried about John's daughter as I thought they would turn her into a wimpy damsel in distress but I am so glad that I was proved incorrect (for a change!) The baddies, except an evil Timothy Olyphant, who we don't see enough of, were all the usual stereotypical hairy eastern European were all fun, and all met there demise in all sorts of interesting ways created by the great John McClane.Also the great Kevin Smith appeared as Freddie the Warlord what more could you ask for? What's that I hear? You want a plot? Well apparently Timothy Olyphant's character warned the US Government about the failures in their security system and they 'Crucified' him. He then seemed to go insane, gather a motley crew consisting of Maggie Q, the Eastern Europeans and the Nerdy Computer Guys in a plan to prove to the US Government just how easy it would be to place the Country into the dark ages, and naturally chaos ensues and only John McClane bring them down, protect a computer hacker and save his daughter (all at the same time of course!) People will argue that it is unrealistic, how can one man survive such a beating blah blah blah¬Ö but who cares its an action movie people!! If you have to pick faults in the film, I would go for the over use of the word 'Armageddon' Also Yippe I Ki Yeah Mutha *BANG* doesn't have the same ring to it - that was a bit of a cop out! Most critics will say - leave you brain at the door and just enjoy the action I say - bring your brain with you and just appreciate and enjoy a good action movie when you see it and allow yourself to be entertained. You don't need to make an excuse to enjoy the movie people! I give it 9/10 - it loses a point for being a sequel (personal rule!)",9,1,3,8 July 2007
300," 300 outa 300!!
","This is one of my picks for film of the year and it was finally released in Ireland last week and I have finally gotten to see it! There is no doubt that the trailer for The 300 is one of the best trailers out there. It looked fantastic, although fantastic trailers sometimes turn out to be much better than the movies themselves, for a reference see Miami Vice.I was not disappointed.I was also not at the battle of Sparta myself (although towards the end i was so into the film i nearly got out of my seat and joined the Spartan front line), so I don't care that it was not an accurate historical account of the battle.OK so the scenes with talking, mostly those involving the Queen and the Council (there is clearly deleted scenes, one of which will no doubt involve the Queen and the Traitor, and will probably be included in the extended edition, after we have all bought the original DVD), were used by the vast majority of the cinema audience for bathroom breaks and the dialogue was a bit cheesy in parts, but it didn't matter. The battle scenes, backgrounds and music more than made up for it. It was one of the few movies that i have seen where i could have just watched them fight without any talking at all.As with all sports movies, we only focus on a few of the team and to follow that rule we only get to know about 5 of The 300. The King, The Captain, The Quiet One, The Comedy One and The Young One. All of whom were great in their own roles. The Persian leader, was freakishly tall and covered in gold was scary looking and had wonderfully plucked eyebrows and some of the characters like the Deformed Spartan who looked like Gollum's ugly cousin looked great too. Although at the end Deformed Spartan wore this ridiculously pointy hat which caused a giggle to run through the cinema There was a fantastically choreographed fight scene involving The Comedy One and The Young One, it was like a dance. All of the battle scenes were great. From Rhinos, to elephants, and the scene where the Spartans pushed the Persians into the sea where just so well done. The film really worked with the stylised look.the whole rock music theme really worked. The was a scene where the Spartans were all walking toward the Persians with the music blaring loudly was stolen right out of any football movie you care to chose Some of the great lines from the Trailer where there. The 'Tonight we dine in hell' one was my favourite from the trailer but when The Comedy One said his 'fight in the shade line' i think that i actually swooned. The 'no retreat, no surrender' line brought a smile to my face as its the title of a bad Jean Claude Van Dam movie and can also be found on some old murals which lurk around over here (Ireland!) One of my friends complained that the Spartans were all Scottish. I didn't mind. If you want to pick a group of tough people who will fight to the death to protect their country and family you might as well pick anyone with a Celtic background (Celts never back down from a fight!! lol).One of the downsides was the fact that with the exception of the Queen, all the women whether they be oracles or slave whores all had to have at least one breast showing. There were that many overly pointy nipples on screen at one stage i thought about going to A&E afterwards to make sure i was normal!!! I also appreciate that slow mo makes battle scenes look more impressive and there was a lot of slow mo used in this film and all of it worked don't get me wrong, but the film only lasted about 1h45mins. If it was all played at normal speed we would've been finished in about an hour. Not exactly value for money.I like the fantasy element of the battle. I didn't mind the big dumb ogre and the big fat thing with spikes for hands but i draw the line at Sitar playing Goat. It looked so bad it could've been an extra from the Jabba the Hut dance scene in Star Wars.Overall I would give this movie a 9/10. Just for the look of it. The writers aren't going to win any awards for the dialogue etc but the movie worked better when no body spoke at all. There was some comedy throughout the film and I would've liked more screen time for The Comedy One but only because he was my favourite Spartan. It loses a point for the sitar playing goat only because it was so out of place, even in this film! I will buy the DVD when it comes out, but this is a film that will only work best when you see it in the cinema, my tiny 6 speaker surround sound will not do the film justice at all.",10,0,5,1 April 2007
Slumdog Millionaire," Excellent movie - my final answer
","If someone told me in January 2008 that a film about some street kid winning Who Wants to be a Millionaire, based on the novel Q&A, would be a front runner for all the major awards I would have laughed in their face, but here we are in January 2009 and that is exactly what has happened.With Danny Boyle directing, we follow the story of Jamal, a teenager from the streets of Mumbai who has just won the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. With the authorities not able to comprehend how Jamal could win the show and not scholars and doctors he is arrested and told to explain how he did it. The answer is simple - he just knows the answers.We are then treated to a series of flashbacks starting from his early youth and working their way up to the present day, with each flashback intertwining and showing us how he came to know about the answer to the questions.It is a beautifully shot film (right up there with Sunshine), with all the vibrant colours of India contrasting starkly with the brutal life of children trying to survive the streets.Danny Boyle has always been skilled when it comes to soundtracks - who can forget the iconic 'perfect day' scene in Trainspotting and here it is no different as Slumdog Millionaire is accompanied by a loud, banging, Bhangra soundtrack which fits in so well, especially tracks such as Paper Plane, Millionaire and O¬ÖSaya (I have downloaded the soundtrack already!) The three main characters, Jamal, his brother Saleem and love Latika are all played by three separate actors, and you cannot fault any of them, especially the child actors who are just so absorbing to watch.It is just a fantastic movie that more than lives up to its hype - it will be impossible not to leave the movie not feeling uplifted. 10/10 in every way and yes that is my final answer (no apologies for the pun).It is also worth staying through the end credits were we are treated to an all singing all dancing Bollywood ending performed by the cast.",10,1,3,18 January 2009
The Proposal," I Do ....maybe.....if no one else offers
","PLOT: Successful B!tch is about to be deported and needs to marry her long suffering and easygoing assistant to stay in the country. They are stalked by an immigration officer and head up to Alaska to meet the grooms reasonably quirky family. Unlike frosty Alaska the Successful B!tches heart begins to melt. They fall in love. They fall out. They re- fall in love. They get engaged for real. END PLOTIf you have read this and are thinking - 'Hey! You have totally spoiled the movie for me' then where the hell have you been living since the dawn of time? All romantic comedies must follow the same beats. It's the law, it's probably in the American Constitution somewhere so as with most rom-coms The Proposal doesn't rely on the story for originality or shocks but rather on the performance of the leads and supporting cast, as we already know before the teaser trailer has ended that they will in fact, live happily ever after.Nowhere in cinematic history has the two leads in a movie been as preened, polished, groomed, styled and perfected as Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. They are barely human. They exist solely to be beautiful. Even if they are covered in mud or almost drowned in the Alaskan sea they still pull of dowdy in the most preened, polished, groomed, styled and perfected way.Bullock and Reynolds have the advantage of being naturally charismatic and both can to comedy competently up to standard rom-com expectations. If the movie had starred Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey then you know you would be in for a tough ninety minutes.The problem is Bullocks character, when in New York and in b!tch mode never really seemed that threatening. Is it possible for Bullock to be unlikeable? She lacked that extra bit of bitterness and sharpness that someone like Meryl Streep could easily just phone-in to her performance. This meant that the inevitable softening of her character Margaret didn't really pull any emotional punches as she didn't come off as particularly mean or distant in the first place. I am not heartless though, when Betty White (a name I probably should recognise but I honestly don't!) gave her a necklace which is a longstanding family heirloom it was quite sweet to watch her realise that she was an accepted member of the Paxton family.Reynolds was just Reynolds, walking around with two out of his small selection of looks. This movie we were treated to 'confused' and 'smart ass'. You can tell them apart by how far he opens his mouth and widens his eyes. As with all rom-coms there is that one character who is there for the purpose of obtaining cheap laughs. He is usually a male most likely to be effeminate in nature or an in-your-face-homosexual, as, we all know - gay people are hilarious (apart from Will and Grace). The Proposal went the other way with Oscar Nunez' who stars (so I have read) in the American version of The Office playing the roles of the town stripper, shop assistant and vicar. The audience seemed to really enjoy his strip routine and were in hysterics when he popped up out of the blue to marry Margaret and Andrew (Reynolds) but me - not so much.Apart from Bullock and Reynolds there is nothing more beautiful than rom-com New York. It is as preened, polished, groomed, styled and perfected as can be. It does look gorgeous but it was totally upstaged by Alaska. It turns out Alaska isn't all husky dogs, igloos and Sarah Palin (pitiful attempt at political humour) as the location was gorgeous and to be honest I would take small town Sitka over uptown New York any day of the weekI think that the only flaw in The Proposal is that I was there to see it. The audience in the packed out screen two were thoroughly enjoying themselves, laughing out aloud at the tiniest little thing whereas the most I could muster up was a smile at Gammys fake heart attack. I didn't sit there stone faced the whole time and I did enjoy the movie for the time filling ninety minutes that it was but I don't think I laughed once as I found nothing particularly funny in the entire movie.The Proposal could be compared to an old repeat of Friends - you watch it for easygoing familiarity and comfort and not for high class and witty humour. I would give it a generously watchable 6/10; you know going into the movie that you wont be watching anything remotely original but the charisma of Bullock and Reynolds give it an extra few points.",6,0,3,1 August 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Bigger is Sometimes Better
","Bigger is Sometimes BetterI am a Simpsons fan in the sense that if someone quotes from an episode or goes - do you remember that episode of The Simpsons when¬Ö I know what they are talking about. I haven't seen every episode, far from it, but I know enough about the family to be excited about The Simpsons Movie.The movie opens with in a cinema with Itchy and Scratchy The Movie playing. Homer then begins to complain loudly about having to pay for something he can see for free on the TV and points to the cinema audience calling them all idiots. That appeals to my sense of humour and thought it was hilarious. I knew from that moment on I would not be disappointed.The most amusing part came from a child in the cinema who when the 'To be continued' sign came up asked if it was over! PLOT: Homer spills some waste from Spider-Pig (or Harry Plopper), even though he was warned not from Marge, into the river and this causes a toxic meltdown. President Schwarzenegger picks from a selection of options - He was elected to lead and not to read - and Springfield is trapped inside a huge dome. The Simpsons escape to Alaska and in the end return to save Springfield. The plot sounds as though it would fit quite easily into a twenty minute cartoon but the summary of the plot does not do it justice. The script is full of gags and is more than adequate to keep an audience glued to the screen for ninety seven minutes.CAST: All the cast is back and that is no mean feat. The Greenday Cameo at the start was very funny - especially their homage to Titanic!! Was this perhaps a subtle dig at The Simpsons Movie sinking Titanic? (terrible pun intended!). Overall This is a very short review because I don't want to give to much away and list all of the many gags and funny parts. I will say keep a look out for the jump over Springfield Gorge as you can see the ambulance which crashed into the tree during Homers famous previous attempt at jumping the Gorge.I would give it a 9/10. A very enjoyable film that was worth the wait.",9,1,5,29 July 2007
Atonement," 10/10
","Its not often that you can go to the cinema and use the word 'beautiful' to describe a film, but in this case the word 'beautiful' does not do Atonement justice.The story follows a young teen named Briony played very well by Saoise Ronan, who witnesses her older sister Cecilia (Kiera Knightly) and gardener Robbie, whom she has a crush on (James McAvoy as close as he will ever get to an Oscar) making love in the library. After this she sees her cousin Lola being attacked in the garden and as a childish act of revenge, not fully realising the seriousness of her actions lies to the police and frames Robbie.The story jumps on a few years and we see Robbie conscripted to the army and Cecilia, who has now left her family working as a nurse in London and a now grown up Briony training as a nurse trying to atone for the damage that she has caused.I had not read the book before going to see the film and for the first time ever I am glad that I did not. There is an unexpected twist at the end of the movie that is absolutely devastating as we do not get the ending that we are accustomed to and if you become as engrossed as I was there will in all likelihood be tears.The film is shot to perfection by Joe Wright, who now will be officially known as the director that made Kiera Knightly grow up and shake of the awful Pirates movies.Every shot is just gorgeous to look at.There is one long scene showing the evacuation at Dunkirk which on its own deserves an Oscar. It was not like usual war time scenes, all patriotic and noisy. I was very quiet apart from a group of soldiers singing in an old band stand. It is a very poignant scene and will be remembered for a long time to come.This film is a shoe in for at least a couple of Oscars, and for once a film in the Oscar hunt has managed to quietly show its worth without any desperate Will Smith 'give me a Oscar please' performances. James McAvoy and especially the young Saoise Ronan deserve at least a nomination.I would honestly give this film a 10/10. It is hard to pick a fault in one of the best films of the year.",10,12,22,9 September 2007
