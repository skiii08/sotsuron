Walk the Line," humble and great storytelling
","Normally I'm not a great fun of Hollywood biopics as a genre but in this case it works just perfect! I don't think there could've being any better way to bring life of Johny Cashon on screen. The choice of actors is fantastic. It was also a beautiful surprise for me to hear them both sing so well. And I'd like to mention that the chemistry between the two of them is just breathtaking. About the director Jamed Mangold. He's already done some real good films and with 'work the line' he proves one's again his talent for the storytelling. He's this rare type of a film director who are not seeking to bring his persona all the time in each of their movies, if you know what I mean, he's just wants to tell a good story.",9,1,2,24 May 2006
