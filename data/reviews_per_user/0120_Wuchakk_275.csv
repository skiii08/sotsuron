The Blair Witch Project," Three amateur phukkin filmmakers stumbling around the phukkin woods of Maryland
","Released in the summer of 1999 three weeks after the mockumentary 'Curse of the Blair Witch' debuted on TV, 'The Blair Witch Project' is a found-footage film that covers the last days of three amateur filmmakers who wander around the woods of Maryland bickering and cussing.I'm not a fan of found-footage films because they're not entertaining by their very nature. Since these types of movies are supposed to be 'found footage' they come across as interesting as home movies of family/friends vacations, except that something weird or horrific is taking place. In this case, the three youths are baffled by the evidence of someone (or something) harassing them in the woods, which gets increasingly terrifying. It starts with mysterious piles of rocks and then stick figures; finally someone disappears and they later hear him/her torturously yelling in the distance.The movie runs 81 minutes and that's just too long for the content. It could've easily been cut in half and would've been more effective for it, but they obviously had to make it 'feature length.' The Maryland woods and Heather Donahue's curvy butt can only maintain your attention for so long. The mockumentary 'Curse of the Blair Witch' was a great set-up for this film and it's entertaining for what it is, but it's only like half as long. Watching three people stumble around the forest in home-movie quality footage cussing at each other is just tedious and unentertaining. For me, it's total dullsville; a snorefest. A good example of a movie that takes the 'Blair Witch' template and makes a vastly more entertaining movie is 2013's 'Another Kind,' but that's mainly because it's an actual movie and not 'found footage.'

Despicable Me 2," Gru goes secret agent and falls in love while the Minions are kidnapped
","Released in 2013, 'Despicable Me 2' is the sequel to the hit 2010 animated film. This time Gru is propositioned by the Anti-Villain League and teams up with Agent Lucy Wilde to find out who stole a mutagen known as PX-41, which turns subjects into aggressive monsters. Gru is convinced that the presumed dead supervillain, El Macho, is responsible while the leader of the Anti-Villain League concludes he's incompetent. Meanwhile Gru goes on his first date, many of his Minions are kidnapped and Margo becomes infatuated by a boy at the mall.Like the original, 'Despicable Me 2' is zany, consistently amusing and often laugh-out-loud funny. It's hard to determine which one's better as it's simply a continuation of the story with a more James Bond bent and a smidgen of 'Gremlins.' Lucy's a great addition and you can't help but hope a Mulder-Scully relationship develops between Gru and Lucy.The movie runs 98 minutes.GRADE: A-",8,0,0,15 September 2015
The Mask," Top-of-the-line comedy/drama/fantasy/thriller with Jim Carrey based on the Dark Horse comic book
","RELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Chuck Russell based on Mike Richardson's comic, 'The Mask' stars Jim Carrey as a bank clerk who is an extraordinarily nice guy, but too much of a pushover when it comes to confrontations. He inadvertently finds a mask of Loki, the Norse night god of mischief and, when he puts it on, he becomes his true self, the person he is WITHIN: a cartoony romantic wild man. Peter Greene plays the head antagonist while Peter Riegert plays the police lieutenant who investigates the havoc in the wake of The Mask.Jim Carrey's breakout year was 1994 when his three hugely popular movies hit the theaters: 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,' this one, and 'Dumb and Dumber.' The following year he appeared in 'Batman Forever' and the sequel to 'Ace Ventura.' 'The Mask' easily ranks with his best films. When I first saw this flick in the late 90s I didn't know anything about the Dark Horse comic, so when Carrey's character first puts the mask on I didn't know what to expect and so was thoroughly taken aback by the kinetic flurry of thrills and laughs.Cameron Diaz appears on the babe front and the film really highlights her winsome appeal and ravishing figure, not that I was ever enraptured by her (then again, I don't NOT like her either). The song & dance routine featuring The Mask & Tina (Diaz) at the Coco Bongo nightclub is knock-it-out-of-the-ballpark entertainment. Remember those great song & dance routines in Coppola's 'The Cotton Club' (1984)? Parts of 'The Mask' are like that, but with a silly, comedic and over-the-top dynamism. The stunning Amy Yasbeck also has a significant secondary role (be sure to watch the deleted scenes to discover what happens to her character; it's hilarious in a black humor way and should've never been cut from the movie).THE FILM RUNS 101 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & San Pedro Bay, California.

Saturday Night Fever," Great snapshot of the disco era with compelling characters and story
","RELEASED IN 1977 and directed by John Badham, 'Saturday Night Fever' is a drama/musical detailing events in Brooklyn where a group of Italian-American youths led by Tony Manero (John Travolta) work dead-end jobs, rumble with Hispanics and meet babes at the local discothèque where Tony is a champion dancer. Donna Pescow plays his needy wannabe girlfriend while Karen Lynn Gorney plays his dance partner for a big contest. This was a huge hit in its day and the catalyst for disco fever throughout the world. To this day you'll see people mimic Travolta's iconic dance stance with one arm pointing upward and the corresponding leg out. John was in the prime of his life at 22 during shooting (a great inspiration for guys to get in shape) and already popular due to TV's Welcome Back Kotter. 'Saturday Night Fever' shot him to stardom, making him a household name. The movie's hit status was deserved because of its emphasis on the ordinary, but interesting protagonists and their entertaining drama, not to mention the dynamic dance sequences and popular soundtrack featuring the Bee Gees. There are several quality scenes, including one with the magnificent Brooklyn Bridge as a backdrop. Watch for 19 year-old Fran Drescher making her acting debut in a glorified cameo. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 58 minutes and was shot in Brooklyn, New York City. WRITERS: Nik Cohn (story) and Norman Wexler (screenplay). GRADE: A-/B+",8,1,2,31 March 2018
Whip It," Coming of age with the roller derby girls
","Released in 2009, 'Whip It' was Drew Barrymore's first and (so far) only full-length film in the director's chair. Drew also co-stars, but she's a side character and non-essential to the plot.The story revolves around 17 year-old Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page), her parents (Daniel Stern & Marcia Gay Harden) and her best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat). Bliss is involved in the world of beauty pageants due to her mother's obsession, but becomes fascinated by a group of roller derby girls while visiting nearby Austin, TX. She decides to try-out for the the Hurl Scouts.'Whip It' starts out slow and only mildly interesting but it ultimately won me over. This is basically a coming-of-age drama using the roller derby as a backdrop and stage. Since Ellen Page takes center focus, and does a great job, 'Whip It' should appeal to fans of Page. I'm not a fan; I can take her or leave her. Thankfully, there's enough good here to draw in other folks.I especially like the roller derby girls and their camaraderie & competition. The girls include Juliette Lewis, Kristen Wiig, Eve, Zoe Bell, Ari Graynor, Eli Bleiler and Sydney Bennett. What I love about these women is that they have womanly curves and aren't walking sticks with big breasts. Take, for instance, the so-called Manson Sisters, played by Kristen Adolfi & Rachel Piplica; both are just jaw-droppingly gorgeous throughout the film and worth the price of admission -- stunning examples of womanhood.There's a subplot about Bliss falling for a guy in a rock band (Landon Pigg) and there are other characters, like the coach, the derby announcer and the Hispanic manager of the restaurant Bliss & Pash work at (Andrew Wilson, Jimmy Fallon and Carlo Alban respectively), but this is mainly about Bliss, her family, Pash and the derby girls.FINAL SAY: The drama in this coming-of-age flick is a mixed bag; I found the love story kind of tedious but enjoyed Pash and the family dynamics of the Cavendar household. The best part, of course, is the derby action and the ravishing derby babes in all their glory.The film runs 111 minutes and was mostly filmed in Michigan with some shots of Austin, TX.GRADE: B",7,2,4,13 August 2013
The Avengers," The Hulk steals the show!
","Hyped as the greatest superhero film ever made, 2012's 'The Avengers' is an entertaining superhero team flick. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), introduced in 2011's 'Thor,' comes to earth intent on an otherworldly invasion and total conquest. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) of the Federal agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gathers together 'earth's mightiest heroes' to prevent the invasion – Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, The Black Widow, Hawkeye and, believe it or not, the Hulk.The film's hype and record-breaking success raises expectations that are letdown by a set-up that goes on & on and isn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time is spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which creates a somewhat one-dimensional vibe. Lastly, although Loki is an excellent villain, the otherworldly army known as the Chitauri are stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who are way too-easily slaughtered, excepting the colossal mechanical snake-creatures.Despite those few negatives, there are numerous highlights: Scarlett Johannson as Black Widow; straight-laced and Old-fashioned Captain America at odds with the overly-hip Tony Stark/Iron Man (Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. respectively); Chris Hemsworth as the noble Thor; Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury; a touching subplot concerning the Black Widow & Hawkeye (Jeremey Renner); and Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner.Speaking of Bruce Banner, the Hulk easily steals the show. The best scenes and literal punch lines have to do with the Hulk. As much as I like both the '03 and '08 film versions of the green goliath, this is the definitive rendition.FINAL WORD: 'The Avengers' is definitely an entertaining superhero team flick, but it has its shortcomings. A slow build-up, the one-dimensional setting and a weak army of foes work against the movie, but it's filled with a myriad highlights, including the Hulk and the witty dialog. The third act delivers the goods as a wholly kinetic and engaging superhero team flick.The film runs 142 minutes.GRADE: A-",8,3,8,8 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Entertaining sequel with mediocre story
","Released in 2007 and directed by Jon Turteltaub, 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' brings back Nicolas Cages as Ben Gates, along with his assistant, Riley (Justin Bartha), hot girlfriend (Diane Kruger) and father (Jon Voight). This time Ben's great grandfather is accused of co-conspiracy in Lincoln's assassination and so Ben & Co. travel wide and far to clear his name. The first stop is Paris, then Buckingham Palace, then the White House and ultimately Mount Rushmore. Their misadventures include kidnapping the president (Bruce Greenwood) and desperately seeking to find Cibola (see-BOWL-uh), the legendary Native American City of Gold. Ed Harris appears as the villain, Helen Mirren as Ben's mother and Harvey Keitel as the chief Fed. It's best to watch the original 2004 movie first so you're familiar with the main characters. This is a slickly-made, fun sequel and there's a lot to like about it if you're a fan of the first movie and the Indiana Jones flicks. But it somehow pales in comparison to the nigh great original. Something about the story fails to fully engage; and the increasingly absurd clues become eye-rolling. Thankfully, there are several highlights, like the sequences with the president. And you can tell the cast had a good time together. The score is kinetic, composed by Yes' Trevor Rabin, like the first film. The movie runs 124 minutes and was shot in Virginia, Maryland, Washington DC, South Dakota, Southern California, England and Paris.GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)",5,0,0,2 December 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino's amusing super-assassin bizarro world
","RELEASED IN 2004 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' completes the story of 2003's 'Vol. 1' and fills in the holes. Former assassin, The Bride (Uma Thurmon), seeks vengeance after the murder of her fiancé & friends at a wedding rehearsal in El Paso. She takes on formidable thugs Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hannah) to finally get to ringleader Bill (David Carradine). Gordon Liu plays master martial artist Pai Mei while Michael Parks is on hand as Esteban Vihaio.This part of the duology is more dialogue-driven than 'Vol. 1,' fleshing-out the characters and answering many questions. Such as: How is The Bride such an unconquerable fighter? How did Elle lose her right eye? Why did Bill conduct the wedding massacre? How does Budd spend his retirement? The problem is that the characters are all cartoony caricatures, and merciless assassins to boot. It's impossible to give criminal scum 'more depth,' at least as far as caring for them goes. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Moreover, the story is too shallow to warrant such epic treatment and would've been more effective if both films were condensed into a 2.5 hour flick, cutting out the fat.Still, the movie's so offbeat that it's entertaining in the manner of 1996's 'Mojave Moon,' but better. It's an interesting combo of spaghetti Westerns, 70's martial arts flicks, Bond-isms and all-around Tarantino quirkiness. But suggesting that the 'Kill Bill' flicks are cinematic masterpieces of auteurism is overdoing it. Take, for instance, the ridiculous closing credits, which run well over 12 minutes: The plot and characters are unworthy of such pretentious veneration. If you want masterworks by Tarantino, see 'Django Unchained' (2012) and 'Pulp Fiction' (1994); or even 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009) and 'Jackie Brown' (1997).Still, the movie's strangely amusing, the cast is good (especially Carradine) and Bill's Superman analysis is insightful. The Bride's training with Pai Mei is arguably the best bit.THE MOVIE RUNS 137 minutes and was shot in Southern California; Beijing, China; and Mexico.GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",7,0,1,24 November 2016
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A not bad sequel, but kinda dull
","Released in late 2014, 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' is the third part in the franchise based on Suzanne Collins' popular books. A new nation, Panem, exists in post-apocalyptic North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government led by the pompous President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and others (Natalie Dormer) from the obliterated District 12 go to the supposedly destroyed District 13 to hook up with President Coin (Julianne Moore) and her associates (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Mahershala Ali) where Katniss becomes the 'Mockingjay,' the symbol of revolution for the oppressed districts of Panem. Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson are also on hand.I'm not a huge fan of The Hunger Games films, but I'll watch 'em. I gave the first one a 7/10. This second sequel is a natural extension, but there isn't a lot of action and the drama isn't very compelling, but it's okay. It comes across as drama for teenage girls, which shouldn't be surprising since that's the target audience of the books. Nevertheless, Jennifer's a likable protagonist and I appreciate the realistic air and overall ambiance, as well as the entire dystopian concept. It just needs more oomph, which I hope we'll get with the final film.Lorde's song during the credits is a highlight ('Yellow Flicker Beat').The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Georgia, Germany and Utah (the lake where Katniss sings).GRADE: C+",5,0,2,6 September 2015
Changeling," Unbelievably true story of a hideous crime and police corruption
","***MILD PLOT SPOILERS*** (without giving away the ending)Clint Eastwood's 'Changeling' (2008) stars Angelina Jolie in the true story of a single mother whose young son goes missing in 1928 Los Angeles. The LAPD contact the mother, Christine Collins, several months later and say they found her son, but when she sees him she knows it's not her child. Nevertheless, the LAPD insist that it is, even though he's three inches shorter and circumcised, and pressure her to take him home on a 'trial basis.' When Collins continues to protest the arrogant police captain issues an order to put her into a mental institution. Evidently, the LAPD aren't interested in finding her real son, but rather in saving face and protecting their tarnished reputation. Will Christine Collins get out of the asylum? Will she ever find her son or, at least, find out what happened to him? Will the LAPD be held accountable for their corruption?***END SPOILERS*** Clint Eastwood is an expert filmmaker who rarely delivers a clunker regardless of which genre. 'Changeling' is a drama/mystery with some thriller aspects. I'll be honest with you, my wife bought this movie on DVD and I didn't think I'd like it; the plot didn't interest me and neither did Angelina (she's fine, but I can take her or leave her). However, within 25 minutes I was absorbed into the story and captivated until the end. After it was over I researched the true story of the 'Wineville Chicken Coop' kidnapping and murder case. The case was so repugnant the town changed its name to Mira Loma in 1930.It's not necessary to say anything more. If you're in the mood for a drama/mystery based on an unbelievably true story look no further. Eastwood also composed the score.The film was shot on location in Southern California and runs 141 minutes.GRADE: A",9,2,3,14 July 2014
The New World," Arty, draggy historical romance
","I've seen four of Terrence Malick's movies -- 'The New World' (2005) and his three previous efforts, 'Badlands' (1973), 'Days of Heaven' (1978) and 'The Thin Red Line' (1998). He's an arty filmmaker who isn't interested in making conventional 'blockbusters.' His three earlier efforts are all well-done and in some ways great. For instance, his pictures are always beautiful and imaginative, but there's also an airy, leisurely quality that will turn off some viewers. My favorite, by far, is 'The Thin Red Line,' a flawed masterpiece about the taking of a hill during the Guadalcanal Campaign in WWII. It successfully transcended it's storyline to seek answers to life's most profound questions. I guess Malick does this in all his films to some degree, but he was particularly effective with 'The Thin Red Line.' I mention this to stress that I'm familiar with Malick's films and understand his approach. I was really looking forward to 'The New World,' a historical drama detailing the establishment of the 1607 Jamestown, Virginia, colony with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and others (Christopher Plummer, Wes Studi, etc.).Shot near the actual locations on the Chickahominy River, Virginia, the film -- to be expected -- is beautiful to look at and the costumes, casting, etc. are all top-of-the-line. Unfortunately, for me, the pace is tedious and the themes aren't compelling enough to keep me spellbound. It's more than a tale of discovering a new world or new culture (for both sides); it's mostly a romance, which doesn't do much for me. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe because the pace was too draggy or possibly because I don't find Kilcher as Pocahontas all that captivating. Don't get me wrong, she's excellent in the role; I just don't find her anything to go ga-ga over, as Smith and Rolfe do in the story.One problem I have with the movie is the ridiculous romanticizing of the Natives as super-virtuous. Exhibit A is when Smith reflects in a voice-over: 'They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, no sense of possession.' Why sure! If the Indians had no sense of possession why did they attack the settlement when the Englanders failed to leave the next Spring? Why were tribes in regular warfare all over the Americas? Are we to believe not one of the Natives knew what a lie was? Or jealousy, envy, greed and slander? I get that the naturals weren't yet defiled by European-styled urbanization, but to suggest the above is pretty absurd. You can't tell me there wasn't a brave or two who had his eyes on young Pocahontas and felt a 'smidgen' of jealousy when Smith stirred her romantic interests.The only way I can get past such nonsense and enjoy the movie is the fact that the voice-over in question was SMITH's idealized, romanticized perspective of a people with which he was enamored. In other words, it wasn't reality; it was his temporarily clouded opinion.BOTTOM LINE: 'The New World' will be more appreciated by those who enjoy arty romantic films. For me, I'm in the middle: I see the good of the film -- even the greatness -- and value it, but I can't deny the film's shortcomings as far as a viewing experience goes. Regardless, it's great to be able to go back in time and visualize how it was when the Jamestown colony was established, highly romanticized as it is portrayed here.The film runs 136 minutes (long enough) and the extended cut 172 minutes.GRADE: C+",5,0,1,24 May 2014
Walk the Line," Solid biopic of Johnny Cash with a captivating third act
","Released in early 2005 and directed by James Mangold, 'Walk the Line' is a biopic of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix): His rise to fame, his travails with alcohol & drugs, his first marriage to Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin) and his ever-tightening relationship with June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Robert Patrick (the T-1000 from 'Terminator 2') and Shelby Lynne play Johnny's parents. This is a solid drama that naturally works better for people interested in the inimitable Cash. The first two acts are decent, but nothing great. However, I pleasantly found myself really entering into the story with the third act, which focused on Johnny in his self-made pit of despair and his angel of deliverance, June. I don't have a problem with Phoenix playing the musical icon, except that he was a full half a foot shorter than the towering Cash. Witherspoon is a nice fit for the humble June who was decent-looking, but by no means some hot starlet. In the movie, Vivian (as played by Goodwin) is clearly hotter than Witherspoon. In real-life Vivian was Italian American with an exotic look; she obviously had a splash of African blood running through her veins (nothing wrong with that, of course). Some criticize the movie's portrayal of Cash & his guys auditioning for Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) of Sun Records the same day Johnny worked up the courage to visit the studio in Memphis, hoping to get a recording contract. While they did audition for Phillips and scored a record contract it wasn't the same day and they didn't play 'Folsom Prison Blues,' but a less incendiary song, ''Hey Porter.' However, it is true that, after auditioning with mostly gospel songs, Phillips told Cash that he didn't record gospel music any longer because it wasn't selling, at least not the dispassionate tripe Johnny was trying to sell. It was once rumored that Phillips told Cash to 'go home and sin; then come back with a song I can sell' (lol), although in a 2002 interview Johnny denied that he made any kind of statement.Another problem is the generally negative portrayal of Vivian who, by all accounts, was a good, supportive wife. The problem with their marriage wasn't Vivian, but rather Johnny's increasing addictions and infatuation with Carter.ADDITIONAL CAST: Waylon Payne appears as Jerry Lee Lewis, Tyler Hilton as Elvis and Shooter Jennings as Waylon Jennings. The film runs 136 minutes (extended cut 153 minutes) and was shot in Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas and California.GRADE: B",7,0,0,15 February 2017
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not funny, just stupid, intentionally offensive and phony

With a documentary crew in tow, Borat interviews various people (who are unaware it's all a joke) and eventually becomes intent on meeting and marrying Pamela Anderson.As my title blurb says, 'Borat' isn't funny; it's just stupid, intentionally offensive and phony. As far as the latter goes, the last part with Pamela Anderson is totally contrived and goes against the very directive of the movie -- to film people without their knowing the documentary's fake and showing their authentic responses to the weird and idiotic Borat character.The fact that this POS grossed $128,505,958 in America alone tells you where we are as a society and explains the mass support for someone like HiLIARy.

The Incredible Hulk," Comparing the '08 and '03 versions
","I just viewed the '03 and '08 versions back to back and it's interesting comparing their strengths and weaknesses because they're essentially the same movie. The main difference is that the '08 version omits the conflict Bruce has with his father and exchanges the Absorbing Man (Bruce's father) for the Abomination.The 2008 version starts out better than the 2003 version, more interesting and entertaining, but tends to lose steam by the third act with the ultra-cartooney fight between Hulk and the Abomination. By contrast, the '03 version starts out slow and relatively boring but strongly revives interest by the 90-minute mark when the Hulk has that spectacular rampage that starts in the desert and ends in San Francisco, which lasts a whole 22 minutes. In fact, this rampage is easily one of the most entertaining action pieces in the history of cinema and worth the price of admission. The '08 version has some quality action, for sure, but nothing that even comes close to the main rampage in the '03 version.Edward Norton in the '08 version plays a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana. Not that Bana isn't likable, it's just that he's simply too much of a tall, muscleman to fit the role. He looks like he could kick some serious arse without even becoming the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept.Although the Hulk in the '08 version has a grittier overall appearance, the filmmakers opted for a snot-greened hue, whereas the '03 Hulk has a better shade of green. Furthermore, '03 Hulk looks more realistic and less cartooney, although the facial features of the '08 Hulk are excellent.The '03 version also shows the Hulk jumping around with incredible leaps – almost flying – as he does in the comics, which the '08 version barely implies. The likely reason for this is that the filmmakers rightly realized they couldn't even touch Ang Lee's film in this area. Of course the '03 Hulk is bogged down by the origin story, while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes. To make matters worse for the '03 version, changes were made that slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In Hulk '03 the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table. The '08 version changes the Hulk's origin as well, making it similar to the TV show, plus tying it in to the 'super soldier' serum. The '08 version wins the prize on this front.Some say that the '08 version opts for brawn over the brainy approach of the '03 version, but -- with the exception of Hulk's fight with the Abomination at the end -- this isn't even remotely true. Each film has a lot of drama and I was impressed with the reverent, realistic tone both films have in their non-hulk portions. Banner's relationship with Betty Ross is particularly well-done and moving, especially in the '08 version. Great job by the principles here -- Bana, Norton, Jennifer Connelley and Liv Tyler.Great soundtracks in both versions. So, both films are quality Hulk flicks with some great moments and the '03 version with its spectacular 22-minute Hulk rampage, but each have their strengths and weaknesses. Take the best parts of both and you'd have an incredible Hulk film! (sorry) Needless to say, if you're a Hulk fan it's necessary to purchase BOTH films.GRADE: B+",7,0,1,10 April 2012
Antz," Decent animated insect flick
","Released in 1998 and produced by DreamWorks, 'Antz' is an animated adventure/comedy about a colony of ants where one of the workers named Z (voiced by Woody Allen) feels insignificant in a system of rigid conformity. He meets Bala (Sharon Stone) and they escape the colony to find the mythical 'Insectopia,' which might not be the paradise they anticipated. Meanwhile, arrogant General Mandible (Gene Hackman) seeks to liquidate the lowly worker ants once they finish a mega-tunnel.This is a solid animated flick with many chuckles, but I found the opening act rather dull. The story really picks up when Z and Bala discover the outside world and the myriad hazards thereof. The end reveal of where the colony is located made me bust out laughing.Part of the fun of animated movies is trying to place the voices of the characters. Hackman was easy to figure out, as are Sylvester Stallone and Christopher Walken. Other actors who contributed include: Dan Aykroyd, Anne Bancroft, Jane Curtin, Danny Glover, Jennifer Lopez, John Mahoney and Jim Cummings. How does 'Antz' compare to Pixar's 'A Bug's Life,' which was released about the same time in late 1998? Generally speaking, 'Antz' is more adult-oriented and darker while 'A Bug's Life' is more family-oriented and colorful. When it comes to animated 'bug' films, I much prefer the nigh-genius of DreamWorks' 'Bee Movie' from 2007.The film runs 83 minutes. GRADE: C+/B-",5,0,1,5 December 2016
Requiem for a Dream," Unrelenting denunciation of drug abuse
","I didn't discover Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000) until after discovering its great score. We've all heard this powerful score somewhere over the last dozen years or so since it's been cut & pasted ad infinitum, but I wasn't aware of its name or what film it was originally derived. I finally tracked it down to 'Requiem for a Dream.' The reason it was hard to uncover is because the movie was unsuccessful at the box office, likely due to its NC-17 rating, even though it's generally regarded as a near masterpiece, albeit in the downbeat sense.'Requiem for a Dream' is a film about substance addiction, legal or illegal. The film stars Ellen Burstyn as a Brooklyn widow who has to deal with her addict son (Jared Leto), whom she loves too much to render the necessary 'tough love.' Jennifer Connelly plays the son's girlfriend and Marlon Waylans his best friend, both equally addicted.The film utilizes various creative picture/editing techniques to relay its tale of a slow descent into hell on earth. The characters are understandably kind of pathetic and the story is only moderately absorbing, until the end, that is. The climax is a powerful indictment of drug abuse, legal or illegal. So potent, in fact, that I literally wept (!).The NC-17 rating mainly has to do with a shocking climatic scene involving Connelly's character at some stag party, but there's an R-rated version that relays all the information you need to know. I've seen both and, although I prefer uncensored films, the edited version is worthy. Besides, the cut scene is available on youtube for anyone who's interested.BOTTOM LINE: While the story is only mildly absorbing it has great acting and is filled with kinetic filmmaking, which is both interesting and sometimes annoying. But the ending is pummeling in a horrifying sense, and the score is a veritable masterpiece. However, the film's unrelenting denunciation of substance abuse keeps it from being entertaining in the conventional sense, which isn't a problem for me, but it might compel others to never want to see it again, if at all.GRADE: B+",7,0,1,26 March 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Solid return of the franchise after 16 years, highlighted by Liam Neeson
","A Jedi Knight & his apprentice (Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor) escape a blockade with their new Gungan friend, Jar Jar Binks, and the handmaiden of Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). Upon damaging their vessel, they find sanctuary on a planet where they meet a slave boy, a gifted pilot and engineer, who may be the prophesied 'Chosen One.' Meanwhile, the supposedly extinct Sith resurface, including Darth Maul (Ray Park).'Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace' (1999) is the fourth Star Wars film and the first of the prequel trilogy, followed by 'Attack of the Clones' (2002) and 'Return of the Sith' (2005). It marked writer/director George Lucas' return to the popular franchise after 16 years, the previous film being 'Return of the Jedi' (1983).Star Wars is fantasy packaged as science-fiction or 'space fantasy' whereas Star Trek is dramatic science-fiction in a space-travel context. I've always preferred the latter because it's more adult-oriented, but I don't mind a Star Wars flick now and then and 'The Phantom Menace' is entertaining enough.There's a new cast of characters along with a young version of Obi-Wan Kenobi and R2D2, C-3PO, Yoda and Jabba. Liam Neeson stands tall as the no-nonsense Qui-Gon Jinn, McGregor is solid and Portman is attractive at the young age of 17. Also notable is Hugh Quarshie as Captain Panaka.I didn't mind the loathed Jar Jar Binks and I enjoyed the wondrous underwater sequence and the thrilling podrace in the first half (even though the mother allowing her son to enter the life-and-death contest is unlikely, not to mention the Jedi knights condoning it). Unfortunately the climax comes down to the clichÃ©d 'big battle sequence' and it's predictable who's gonna die in the corresponding duel. Yawn. Still, 'The Phantom Menace' is all-around entertaining if you have a taste for Star Wars.The film runs 2 hours, 16 minutes.GRADE: B-/B",6,0,1,11 December 2019
Sucker Punch," Spectacular production and women, but so-so story
","I've seen 2011's 'Sucker Punch' twice now and it struck me the same both times. Like I said in my title blurb, it is a spectacular production with absolutely stunning women, particularly Abbie Cornish and Emily Browning, and it is entertaining in many ways; unfortunately, the story is only moderately interesting.Browning plays 'Baby Doll' in the 1950s, whose wicked stepfather takes her to a mental asylum to receive a lobotomy. He wants to shut her up to hide his crimes, of course. She resorts to fantasy to escape her predicament, imagining herself and the other people at the asylum in a mob-owned brothel. When she's forced to dance at the 'brothel' she withdraws further into wild fantasies involving feudal Japan, World War I German soldiers, a dragon and an assortment of other bizarre imaginations.There's some depth here. The film's not all hot babes in lingerie and CGI-laden action fantasies. But I'll have to watch it a couple of more times to figure it out. The multi-layered nature of the plot -- reality turning to fantasy and then fantasy within fantasy -- is somewhat off-putting and tends to take one out of the story. As it is, the entertainment value is pretty much limited to the women and the outlandish action sequences. The story of the girls trying to get out of the brothel or asylum is only mildly compelling. Still, it's not bad and I may upgrade my rating after future viewings.The film runs 110 minutes and the extended cut 127 minutes (I own the shorter version and that's more than enough for me).GRADE: C+ or B- (but the women are a definite A+)",6,0,0,28 July 2013
3:10 to Yuma," The price of redemption -- READ THIS if you had problems with the ending
","This remake involves the capture of a notorious outlaw, Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), who is then escorted to the town of Contention to await the train to Yuma, where he'll be hanged. A desperate rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), hires on for the escort job because he needs the $200 for his family to survive. Wade plays psychological games the entire time trying to corrupt Evans, but things turn out differently.The cast is outstanding (which also features the beautiful Gretchen Mol and Peter Fonda), the New Mexican locations are great and the score ranks with the all-time best. Most importantly the picture is engaging throughout its 2 hour runtime, not to mention the story gives the viewer a lot to chew on.The first hour of the film is realistic but what turned me off during my initial viewing was the second hour's mounting implausibilities. Thankfully, most of these can be explained.One issue is when a man burns to death locked in a wagon carriage. The quibble is that he doesn't scream enough in fiery torment. But watch the scene and you'll clearly hear him yelling in the background. Evan's loss of a limp at the climax is more of an issue, although this can be explained by an adrenaline rush.One problem I had was that Ben Wade (Crowe) came off as super-human. There was seemingly nothing he couldn't do, even while handcuffed. I suppose this could be explained by the fact that there ARE people who are incredibly gifted to the point of being nigh super-human. In any event, this is not a realistic Western like, say, 'Wyatt Earp' or 'The Long Riders.' No, '3:10 to Yuma' is a MYTHIC Western with an potent message. If you can't handle strong mythic elements in Westerns look elsewhere.When I first saw the film I didn't get the ending and it turned me off. But it was clear that there was more to the picture than what first meets the eye so I decided to view it again. It DOES make sense, it's just that you might miss it on your initial viewing because the events flash by so quickly. When you DO see it, it'll blow you away.***SPOILER ALERT*** DO NOT READ FURTHER UNLESS YOU WANT AN EXPLANATION OF THE FILM! Wade is a confident and talented man who smugly looks down on others, acting like a disciple of Nietzsche who has no moral obligation to anyone, least of all God. He senses simple purity in Evans and plays the role of tempter, trying to corrupt Evans and win him to his way of thinking. But as they wait in the hotel room it is Evans who 'converts' Wade, in a sense. Evans doesn't accomplish this in any type of contrived manner, he accomplishes it simply by being WHO HE IS -- an undefiled, courageous family man who stubbornly refuses to give up on hope, faith, life, righteousness and family.As they're waiting, Wade sketches a picture of Evans in a book. It is later shown that this sketch was made on an opening page of a Bible. This reveals that Wade came to view Evans as a Christ figure, at least subconsciously, and that Evans is clearly a type of Christ in the story.What exactly was it that caused Wade to 'convert' and support Evans? (1.) He saw in Evans a man that refused to be bought -- a man who refused to be corrupted by filthy lucre, which was something he never experienced before. (2.) Evan's son insisted that there was still some good in Wade despite his wicked history. Regardless of Wade's denial, the kid was right. The idea that SOMEONE saw a glimmer of good in him, that SOMEONE out there BELIEVED in him despite his past evil deeds ultimately moved him and compelled him to support Evans. (3.) Wade turned evil because he was abandoned as a kid. He saw in Evans and his wife a REAL family -- parents who stayed together and refused to abandon faith, hope, righteousness and family come hell or high water. He became convinced that Evans and his family were worth supporting, even perhaps dying for. (4.) Evans made a deal with the Pinkerton that if he successfully got Wade to the train the Pinkerton would make sure Evans' family got $1000, which would bail them out of their hardships. Wade wanted to make sure the family got that money. Somewhere deep inside he wanted to redeem himself of his wicked past and this was the opportunity. This could be the beginning of a new life.(5.) Wade's relationship with Evans lasted only a few days but he found something that was missing in all his other relationships - a friendship based on respect rather than familiarity or shared events. Great friendships like this can happen quickly similar to love-at-first-sight. Such relationships are conducive to transparency, which explains why Evans reveals to Wade the real reason he lost his leg in the war.After Evan's brutal death Wade has an even greater revelation: To see a truly undefiled man -- a simple but GREAT man -- murdered by a group of immoral swine fills him with disgust. You can see it on his face. Yes, he should be thankful that his men remained loyal to him but this was about their only redeeming quality. To truly start a new life he would have to be judge and executioner of the corrupted souls who would pull him back down into the slime.Why did Evans have to die? Because redemption can only be paid via the spilling of blood. It was the price for Wade to live and have a new life.GRADE: A",9,1,2,19 August 2011
The Expendables 2," Another fun action flick full of veterans from the 80s & 90s, better than the first
","Released in 2012, 'The Expendables 2' stars Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, the leader of a group of mercenary veterans who are hired by the CIA to do their dirty work. In this case their mission is to go to Albania to retrieve something that was on a plane that crashed; they're accompanied by technical expert Maggie Chan (Nan Yu) to make sure they get it. When one of their younger members is murdered by a villain so villainous his name is Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme), their quest for revenge brings them to Bulgaria, an abandoned Russian military base, a friendly village and a mine of enslaved workers. Chuck Norris has a glorified cameo while Charisma Carpenter reappears in a small role.The Expendables franchise is a great way to get all those action stars from the 80s & 90s together for a fun action flick that balances quasi-seriousness with amusing moments and over-the-top action scenes. This one's even better than the first IMHO. Maggie works well with the team and they should've kept her for the third one; Nan Yu's a cutie who's intelligent and formidable to boot, plus she has good chemistry with Stallone. The Bulgarian sequences are top-rate.The film runs 103 minutes and was shot in Louisiana, Bulgaria and China.GRADE: B",7,0,0,17 November 2015
Iron Man 3," Worthwhile, but a bit of a letdown compared to the snappy 'Iron Man 2'
","Released in 2013, 'Iron Man 3' stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark in this third installment where Shellhead takes on the so-called Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and A.I.M. (Advanced Idea Mechanics), led by Killian (Guy Pearce). After Stark's personal world is destroyed, he is left to survive by relying on his ingenuity and instincts to rise from the ashes and protect those closest to him, like Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). In the process Tony seeks to answer a question that has haunted him: Does the suit of armor make the man or does the man make the suit of armor? Don Cheadle and Jon Favreau are on hand as James Rhodes (War Machine) and Happy Hogan respectively while Rebecca Hall plays an agent of A.I.M.After the absolutely kinetic (and inexplicably criticized) 'Iron Man 2' this third part of the trilogy is a bit of a letdown. It's a quality superhero movie, but the first act is lethargic compared to the dynamic initial reel of the previous movie. Things pick up in the second act as Stark is separated from his loved ones and presumed dead, forced to team up with a brainiac kid. While some claim that the movie's 'more serious' than 'Iron Man 2,' it has the same tone and the same main characters/cast; the amount of 'more seriousness' is marginal.People say 'Iron Man 3' plays better on repeat viewings, so I'll update this review after future viewings. But I was letdown by the lame representation of the Mandarin, the ambiguous powers of the A.I.M. operatives, the myriad Iron Man suits functioning without a person in them and the fact that everyone and their brother dons the Iron Man armor or parts of it. For instance, Pepper morphs into a veritable superheroine at one point. Nevertheless, it's not bad at all and the cast is great with Rebecca Hall and Guy Pearce effective in their roles.The movie runs 130 minutes and was shot North Carolina, Southern California and Miami.GRADE: C+",5,0,1,14 May 2016
Marie Antoinette," Luxurious, carefree life in the Palace of Versailles before the storm (the French Revolution)
","RELEASED IN 2006 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, 'Marie Antoinette ' chronicles France's iconic but doomed queen, Marie Antoinette (Kirsten Dunst), from just prior to her betrothal & marriage to Louis XVI at 15 in 1770 to her reign as queen at 19, her eventual decline, and the close of her reign with the fall of the Palace of Versailles, located a few miles West of Paris.This is an opulent and beautifully stylized interpretation of the historical events combining period tunes with anachronistic modern music (new wave, post-punk and electronica), which successfully humanizes the historical figures and their world for a contemporary audience. The first two acts effectively show what life in Versailles was like for royalty & nobles in the 18th century; but the last act subtly conveys the looming upheaval of the brutal French Revolution, which was the consequence of foolish spending and blithe, luxuriant living without concern for the common people. THE FILM RUNS 2 hours 3 minutes and was shot in France with studio work done at Pinewood Studios, England. WRITER: Sofia based her script on Antonia Fraser's book Marie Antoinette: The Journey. BOX OFFICE: With a budget of $40 million, the film took in a little over $60 million worldwide. GRADE: B+/A-",8,1,2,1 January 2018
The Ring," The mysterious atmosphere makes this film
","'The Ring' is a psychological horror film from 2002, an American remake of the 1998 Japanese film 'Ringu', which in turn was based on the 1991 book. The story revolves around a VHS tape that is cursed: whoever watches it will die in seven days. A reporter (Naomi Watts) catches wind of it and watches the video. She starts to sense that the curse is real and tries to find the answer.Shot mostly in Washington state (with some parts in Oregon and California), 'The Ring' is a polished film with a nice, haunting vibe, which can be attributed to the excellent cinematography, the thick forests and constant rain. Watts and Martin Henderson are worthy protagonists as well.Unfortunately, the back story of the ghostly girl is convoluted and too much is left unexplained (Why do horses go nuts on two occasions? Why is the little girl evil? Where did she come from? And the chronology of the back-story is hard to figure out), but maybe the answers are there if you rack your brains. I'll do that the next time I watch the film.Another positive is that the ghostly element is actually rather chilling. This is important to me because ghost flicks normally bore me. After all, what can an immaterial ghost do to you anyway? Not much except maybe make objects fly in a whirlwind of negative energy. So what's to be scared of? They're dead and can't do any significant harm. 'The Ring' effectively changes this and makes the apparition frightful. Other films have followed suit, like 2004's 'The Grudge' and it's sequels.Speaking of subsequent films, many of them have taken elements of 'The Ring' and made better films, at least as far as the story goes; for instance, the excellent 'From Within' (2008). But it's hard to beat the mysterious ambiance of 'The Ring.' Some complain about one or two false endings, but the movie couldn't end without revealing what killed the girl in the opening teaser.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: B",7,0,0,16 January 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the top five action/adventure films ever made
","The biggest blockbuster of 1981, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' introduced the now-iconic Indiana Jones, played by Harrison Ford. The film is a series of globetrotting adventures as Jones and other characters seek the lost Ark of the Covenant and (gulp) dare to open it.'Raiders' ranks with my top five films of all time. Not only is the action/adventure exhilarating from beginning to end, the story's compelling and the characters are interesting. Ford is excellent, of course, but you also get Karen Allen (Miriam), Paul Freeman (Belloq), Ronald Lacey (Major Arnold Toht), Wolf Kahler (Colonel Dietrich), John Rhys-Davies (Sallah) and several more (e.g. Denholm Elliott). Rhys-Davies and Lacey are standout examples of the excellent supporting cast.Everything about 'Raiders' magically works and you can tell the incredible effort that was put into making it. While Steven Spielberg directed it, George Lucas & Phillip Kaufman came up with the story and Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay. Needless to say, it's significantly better than the three sequels/prequels, as well as the direct-to-video/TV ones. Don't get me wrong, most of the other Indy adventures are worthwhile, but none capture the beginning-to-end magic of the original.The film was so successful that a hoard of movies clearly borrowed from it in the ensuing decades. Some quite successfully, like 1999's 'The Mummy,' and others not-so-successfully, like 2001's 'The Mummy Returns.' Speaking of the latter film, it has a lot going for it, including the Indiana Jones appeal: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc., but it's all for naught as the plot and characters are merely a clothesline to string together continuous action and F/X sequences. It's all style and 'excitement' without substance. 'Raiders,' by contrast – fun as it is – includes an interesting story, character depth and even some fascinating insights. On top of this is the string of action sequences second-to-none: The jungle treasure opening, the Nepal bar brouhaha, the streets of Cairo chase, the Well of Souls in Tanis sequence, the plane episode, the truck sequence, and, of course, the thrilling and horrifying opening of the sacred Ark.The jungle scenes were shot in Kaua'i; the Cairo/desert scenes in Tunisia; the Nazi submarine base in France; the college scenes in Hertfordshire, England; the D.C. scenes in San Francisco; and other scenes in Stockton, CA, and England.The film runs 115 minutes.GRADE: A+",10,2,5,4 February 2015
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter?
","It works for me.'Resident Evil: Afterlife' (2010) is the 4th installment in the series, which started with 2004's 'Resident Evil'. These are the only two films I've seen in the series so I obviously don't consider them 'must see' movies and, yet, I have to admit to being thoroughly entertained when I do. They're basically superhero vs. zombies flicks with loads of style and pizazz. You can't take 'em too seriously and, yet, the stories & characters are ironically dead-serious.I call these 'superhero' flicks because that's what Milla Jovovich is as Alice in a 'last people on earth' scenario. She's dressed in a skintight black outfit with a weapons harness and looks stunning throughout. In this segment she meets up with Claire (Ali Larter) and they fly to a Los Angeles prison where a small group are holed-up against the legions of zombies. They seek to get to an offshore ship, a thought-to-be safehaven from the hordes.Writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson is an expert at making great-lookin' movies with a cool sense of style. In addition, the score and soundtrack are excellent.Being based on a video game, which I've never played, there's loads of action, which gets cartoony at times (e.g. the giant with the axe).The best part is the women. It's hard to choose who's better: Milla or Ali. They're both great, but Ali might have the edge. As magnificent as these two are, they throw in more, like the gorgeous Kacey Barnfield.Taking it for what it is, 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' is a dang entertaining movie.GRADE: B+",7,1,2,7 October 2013
Deja Vu," Denzel Washington tries to deter a terrorist attack upon looking back in time
","After a terrorist explosion of a ferry in New Orleans, an ATF agent (Denzel Washington) joins an experimental FBI surveillance unit that uses space-folding technology to find the culprit and maybe even avert the disaster. While looking in the past he starts to fall for a notable victim of the tragedy (Paula Patton). Val Kilmer plays the head FBI agent and Jim Caviezel the antagonist. Adam Goldberg is on hand as a tech geek.While watching 'Deja Vu' (2006) I couldn't help thinking of 'Enemy of the State' (1998) because of the kinetic editing and advanced surveillance technology. Turns out they were made by the same director, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott's brother, who unfortunately jumped off a bridge in Los Angeles in 2012, ending his life at 68 years-old. (Ridley claimed it was due to his secret struggles with cancer while others say it was due to two antidepressants known to cause suicidal thoughts or paranoid ideation).'Deja Vu' is good, especially the compelling last act. Although it may not be as great as 'Enemy of the State,' the filmmaking expertise is off the charts, particularly in regards to the depictions of surveillance technology. It's mind-boggling to think of the effort that was put into making everything gel and dynamically move along without confusing the viewer. However, it admittedly does get a little convoluted in the second act with the experimental observation equipment, which culminates with a thrilling-but-highly-unbelievable past/present car-chase sequence.Another problem, a minor one, is the revelation of the terrorist, which brings to mind someone like the infamous Timothy McVeigh. Never mind that 99% of the terrorist attacks the world over are by radical Islamists (e.g. 9/11, Orlando, San Bernardino, Chattanooga, Fort Hood, Boston Marathon, Paris, Nice, etc.). Shh, don't tell anyone.The film runs 2 hours, 6 minutes and was shot in New Orleans.GRADE: B",7,0,0,6 May 2019
Training Day," Great urban thriller
","In 'Training Day' Ethan Hawke plays Hoyt, a rookie cop on his first 24-hour training day with the L.A.P.D. narcotics division. Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?'Training Day' had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six weeks as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of 'Training Day' is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, the latter ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in 'Runaway Train' or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in 'Apocalypse Now,' etc., etc.As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, 'I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir.' How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.Additional actors include Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Eva Mendes, Charlotte Ayanna, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre.The film was shot in L.A. and runs 122 minutes.FINAL WORD: 'Training Day' is an excellent urban thriller with an ultra-captivating performance by Washington.

Friday Night Lights," Gritty realistic version of 1999's 'Varsity Blues'
","Released in 2004 and based on H.G. Bissinger's true-life book, 'Friday Night Lights' details the 1988 football season of the Permian High School Panthers of Odessa, Texas. Billy Bob Thornton plays the resolute yet caring coach who has to deal with the pressure to win while Connie Britton plays his wife. Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Derek Luke, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson and Lee Thompson Young appear as the players, amongst others. Tim McGraw is also on hand. While based on a true story, the film borrows heavily from 1999's 'Varsity Blues, which concerned a central Texas team, about 300 miles southeast of Odessa. But, then again, 'Varsity Blues' no doubt borrowed from Bissinger's book and made a fictionalized version of the events. In any case, 'Varsity' is a Hollywoodized version of a Texas champion football team whereas 'Friday Night Lights' is a docudrama. Whether you prefer one or the other depends on what you want. In my opinion 'Varsity' is the better film simply because it's more entertaining and entertainment is the name of the game in cinema. Yet 'Friday' is a compelling realistic take on the same topic. With the exception of Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), 'Varsity' has far more memorable football players; in 'Friday' they're bland by comparison. However, Thornton is noteworthy as the coach. Speaking of which, the character of the coach is the most significant difference between the two films. In 'Varsity' the coach (Jon Voight) is power-mad and abusive whereas in 'Friday Night' he's determined yet goodhearted.

Lone Survivor," Solid war/survival flick
","The film is based on the 2005 American operation in Afghanistan where four SEALs are dropped off near a remote Afghan village to survey a Taliban leader. The mission is compromised when the team runs into three Afghan civilians. Once the Taliban hears of their presence it's four SEALs against a veritable army. Can they make it out alive? I thought this was a solid war/survival movie. It's very realistic, except maybe for the scenes of the SEALs falling down the rocky slopes of the mountain a couple times (how could they even walk after such falls?). The first 45 minutes presents a nice build-up to the action and then it's intense throughout most of the rest of the movie.The final act shares something that I didn't know about this operation, which involves an Afghan village. I not going to say any more because I don't want to spoil it.This is just a straight war/survival flick based on a true story and on that level it works well. It's not American propaganda, as some criticize; it simply honors these courageous men, including some Afghanis. It may lack the depth and greatness of films like 'Platoon,' 'Rambo' (2008) and the original 'Apocalypse Now' (not that lame 'Redux'), but it's still worth checking out.I can't give the film a higher rating because it's not something I care to see again anytime soon. It works for what it is, but it's too one-dimensional and there's one aspect of the story that wasn't true to the real story; it's an obvious cinematic addition to heighten suspense and it's just eye-rolling.GRADE: B-",6,0,1,8 June 2014
Wind River," Murder mystery on a wintery Reservation in Wyoming
","RELEASED IN 2017 and written & directed by Taylor Sheridan, 'Wind River' chronicles events at the remote Wind River Indian Reservation where a curiously barefooted young Native woman is found dead in the wilderness; a Fish & Wildlife tracker (Jeremy Renner) and an FBI agent (Elizabeth Olsen) team-up to solve the mystery. Graham Greene plays the Reservation police chief, Gil Birmingham appears as the victim's grieving father and Jon Bernthal & James Jordan are on hand as security guards at a drill site. There are several others. The film is based on hundreds of actual stories similar to it. The issue of assault against Native women on Reservations, many mysteriously disappearing, has existed since the inception of the Reservation system, but in the past 15-20 years it has exploded and yet gets no attention, which was the motivation for the film. In ages past the tribes (e.g. Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho) would migrate out of the area during the unrelenting winters, but the Reservation system basically forces the tribespeople to permanently stay where people weren't meant to live year round (or so it is argued).This is a straight-forward crime drama/murder mystery/thriller taking place completely in wintery conditions in the remote modern American West. The story starts kind of dull, but interest slowly builds until everything eventually explodes in the second half. If you like stories where the clues slowly lead to the culprit/culprits you'll probably like this movie. Renner is a quality taciturn Westerner and likable Olsen with her cutie face & figure is strong on the female front. The action scenes are effective because they're sudden & realistic and not over-the-top cartoonish. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 47 minutes and was shot in Utah (Coalville and Park City Studios) and Wyoming (Wind River Reservation, Fremont County and Lander). GRADE: A-",8,1,2,4 March 2018

Wayne starts a relationship with a hot Asian rocker (Tia Carrere) while a smooth-talking TV producer tries to take advantage of them (Rob Lowe). The movie was released in 1992 when the 80's rock/metal culture was already fading due to the advent of grunge, but this can be excused on the grounds that the movie can be traced to a comedy sketch from 1987 when hair rock/metal ruled.The main actors are well cast, Tia is stunning while Garth is hideous and often annoying, but otherwise likable. The movie is dumb, but consistently amusing while only occasionally laugh-out-loud funny. The best parts include the 'we don't sell-out to sponsors' sequence and the Scooby-Doo false ending, as well as the 'no Stairway' joke.'Waynes World' is a solid comedy, but you have to be in the mood for a goofy comedy rooted in 80's rock/metal culture.

Unbreakable," What if superheroes are based on reality?
","Released in 2000, 'Unbreakable' was M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to his most successful movie, 1999's 'The Sixth Sense.' The plot revolves around a man (Bruce Willis) who becomes increasingly aware that he possesses superhuman abilities, including invulnerability. This attracts a man on the opposite end of the spectrum who can barely go a week without injuring himself (Samuel L. Jackson). The latter is seriously into superhero-type comics and begins to see the truth about the former. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark play the wife & son of the protagonist while Leslie Stefanson has a glorified cameo.The movie scores high points for originality as the idea that superheroes are based on real-life people adorned with extraordinary powers is intriguing. The tone of the movie is akin to the slow drama with spiritual undertones of Shyamalan's other films, like 2002's 'Signs.' Unfortunately, the ending feels arbitrarily tacked-on and leaves a sour taste. Then again, it might enhance repeat viewings.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Philadelphia.GRADE: B",7,0,1,4 October 2015

A meek new guy who knows little about tanks, Norman (Logan Lerman), joins the crew and must learn to kill. Making a final push into the heart of Nazi Germany, the Fury crew makes a heroic stand when their tank breaks down. Writer/director Dick Ayers wrote the screenplay for 2001's excellent 'Training Day.' In 'Fury' he successfully shows the soldiers' view of WWII through the eyes of a Sherman tank crew. I know of no other war film that sets out or accomplishes this; Oddball and his crew from 'Kelly's Heroes' (1970) perhaps comes closest.I mainly judge films by whether or not the story keeps my attention. After all, what good is great action, thrills and incredible special effects if the story (or the way it's told) is dullsville, like, say, 'The Mummy Returns' (2001) or 'Man of Steel'(2013)? 'Fury' kept my attention from beginning to end and the characters are all memorable. Speaking of which, the three remaining crewmembers are 'Bible' (Shia LaBeouf), 'Coonass' (Jon Bernthal) and 'Gordo' (Michael Peña). 'Bible' is fittingly an evangelical who strives not to lose his spirituality while brutally annihilating people in the name of war, whereas newcomer Norman is a mainline Christian (Episcopalian). A handful of scripture passages are quoted during the course of the movie, including a couple near the end by Wardaddy. This is an interesting revelation because Wardaddy has become hardened by the war after three years fighting from North Africa all the way to the nucleus of the Nazis. This implies that he was a devoted believer before the war but only a glimmer of his former spiritual affection remains. There are other quality character bits interspersed throughout the film, like how annoying drunk bastages may not be so bad once they sober up.Beyond the above, the film offers the typical tragic insights about the nature of war. The long final stand in the last act may be unlikely, but it makes for a heroic and thrilling ending to a war movie (yes, it's a MOVIE, not a friggin' documentary). At the end of the day 'Fury' arguably ranks with the best WWII movies, like 'Where Eagles Dare' (1968), 'Enemy at the Gates' (2001), 'The Eagle has Landed' (1976), 'Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957), 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), 'The Thin Red Line' (1998), and 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009). As far as comparing it to the overrated 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), the first half hour of that movie is great, but the rest of it leaves much to be desired (remember the lame dog tag sequence?); 'Fury' is leagues better IMHO. The melancholic and moving score by Steven Price is a highlight. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma), Anamaria Marinca (Irma) and Jason Isaacs are featured in fairly notable roles. Speaking of Emma, the brief romance between her and Norman is decidedly forced, which is one of the few negatives of 'Fury,' but I get the point of that sequence.THE FILM RUNS 134 minutes and was shot in England.GRADE: A-",8,5,12,14 December 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Refreshingly different alternative WW2 drama/adventure
","RELEASED IN 2009 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, 'Inglourious Basterds' takes place during the German occupation of France in WW2 and revolves around a ruthless 'Jew Hunter' Nazi (Christoph Waltz), a beautiful young theater owner dripping with vengeance, a German war hero who pesters her and a brutal team of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by Lt. Aldo Raine.This was my first taste of the popular director's eccentric repertoire, although I've since seen all of his movies except 'Death Proof' (2007). The first time I tried to watch 'Basterds' I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don't get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn't ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.I eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn't some typical war flick. Strangely, the 'interminable dialogue' pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn't hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.There ARE elements that bring to mind 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn't kick-in until the final act, but 'Basterds' is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.All effective films have quality characters and 'Basterds' has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.Like Tarantino's other great movies ('Pulp Fiction,' 'Django Unchained' and 'Jackie Brown'), 'Basterds' pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic 'blockbuster' syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they're in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer's limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it's an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.THE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.GRADE: A-",8,1,4,2 December 2011
Dawn of the Dead," Horrifying and INTENSE
","'Dawn of the Dead' is the 2004 remake of the original 1978 classic horror film.THE STORY: When dead people start coming back to life it seems like the end of the world. A group of people (led by Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jack Weber and Michael Kelly) hold up in a shopping mall to survive while the dead increasingly congregate outside. What's going on? What can they do? How can they survive? And is there any hope? Although the basic plot is the same as George Romero's original film the characters and storyline are completely different; hence, this is more of a re-envisioning rather than a true remake. Personally I prefer it this way. We already have the original so let's see a different take. No? I just saw this film last night and it was so freakin' horrifying and INTENSE I couldn't sleep for two hours. This, for me, reveals the true effectiveness of a horror flick -- whether or not you can sleep afterwards. In this sense 'Dawn' is a 5/5 Star film all the way.What I liked about the story is that it takes the material seriously; there's no, goofy, campy, unrealistic vibe. What would it be like if dead people REALLY started coming back to life and seeking out living flesh to eat? This is the approach the filmmakers take here.One reviewer complained that it was unrealistic that the characters on occasion would laugh, smile and joke around during such a dire, hopeless situation. But this isn't unbelievable at all. It's a natural defensive mechanism of the human psyche to try to have fun, joke and make the most out of a bad situation. I've seen it numerous times in my life and the lives of others over the years (car accident, hospitalization, destruction of property, serious illness, death, etc.). Besides, the film more than adequately portrays the downside of human reaction -- depression, violence, grief, madness, etc.The only negative I can cite is the speeding-up effect used in the Third Act. It worked at times but too often it came across as awkward or amateurish and just served to confuse the viewing experience.Some people didn't like the zombie birth scene but I found it well-done and effective.The original was filmed at the Monroeville Mall near Pittsburgh, PA, while this remake was shot at the (now demolished) Thornhill Square Mall in Ontario, although the story takes place in Milwaukee.The theatrical version runs 101 minutes (the version I saw) and the Director's Cut 110 minutes.BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a truly intense, horrifying flick you can't go wrong with this 2004 version of 'Dawn of the Dead.'GRADE: A-",8,2,2,12 March 2014
Iron Man 2," Highly entertaining superhero flick
","Released in 2010, 'Iron Man 2' naturally continues where 2008's 'Iron Man' left off. With the knowledge that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is also Iron Man being made public, he must contend with serious heart problems, Daddy issues, alcoholism, a competing rat (Sam Rockwell), a mysterious new employee (Scarlett Johansson), a personal assistant who is now CEO and who also loves him (Gwyneth Paltrow), a friend who becomes a War Machine (Don Cheadle), Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) and a vengeful Russian with ties to his father's legacy (Mickey Rourke).I like this sequel better than the popular original because I generally don't like 'origin stories,' as far as superhero movies go. More than that, 'Iron Man 2' brims with confidence and is just full of kinetic entertainment from beginning to end, highlighted by a rockin' soundtrack and some curvy cuties, most notably Scarlett as The Black Widow (the character's film debut). On top of this, the writers add some meatier elements to the table, like Tony's father/son issues and his sad struggle with alcoholism (which comes straight from the 80's comics, the first superhero to be depicted with this problem). The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and New York City.GRADE: A-",8,1,2,29 March 2016
Lords of Dogtown," The birth of skateboard culture
","In the mid-70s, the accomplishments of the innovative Zephyr skateboarding team of Venice, California, are dramatized based on events chronicled in skater Stacy Peralta's documentary 'Dogtown and Z-Boys' (2001). John Robinson plays Stacy, Emile Hirsch plays Jay and Victor Rasuk plays Tony (aka T.A.). Heath Ledger is on hand as Skip Zephyr while Rebecca De Mornay appears as a struggling mother.While I suppose 'Lords of Dogtown' (2005) is a sports flick, it's just as much a coming-of-age movie detailing growing-up on the bad side of Venice, aka Dogtown, the birthplace of America's skateboard culture, which influenced the world.It reminded me of the dissolute environment depicted in 'River's Edge' (1986) with elements of Jim Morrison's hedonistic misadventures from 'The Doors' (1991), but combined with skateboard action, like skating in dry backyard pools and various competitions. It's a good movie with slightly amped-up events (so what else is new?), but somewhat hampered by a curiously dismal air with occasional dialogues that don't work. Maybe I found it slightly depressing because it reminded me of the glory & shame of my teen years. The 70's soundtrack is great, however.The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area, including Venice Beach, Imperial Beach and Santa Monica.GRADE: B-",6,0,1,13 May 2019
Alien: Resurrection," A combo of the first three with a couple fresh ideas
","Two hundred years after Ripley's death in the previous film (Sigourney Weaver), she wakes up as a clone in a space station, which also serves as a colossal vessel. Scientists there are experimenting with xenomorph/human eugenics to create, I guess, the ultimate living weapon. Meanwhile a ship of smugglers visits the station when (big surprise) the aliens escape captivity. Winona Ryder and Ron Perlman play space pirates while Dominique Pinon and Michael Wincott are leaders at the station. Brad Dourif is on hand as a scientist.'Alien Resurrection' (1997) is the fourth film in the series and combines elements of the previous three while throwing in a couple of new things. The diverse cast is great but I started to get bored by the end of the first act. Thankfully, the movie perks up with an outstanding underwater sequence that recalls 'The Poseidon Adventure' (1972), albeit more amped up.The peripheral cast is highlighted by the voluptuous Kim Flowers as Hillard and the formidable Gary Dourdan as Christie. But you just know they're the equivalent of red shirts in Star Trek.If you've seen the first three entries, there's no pressing reason to see this one. It has a been-there-done-that vibe. However, if you appreciate those films and want more of the same with a new cast, 'Alien Resurrection' is well done for what it is, proficient sci-fi/horror. Armchair critics have been too hard on it. While it lacks the mystery of the first movie and the suspense & utter horror of the second, it has more pizazz than the relatively subdued third installment.The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes.GRADE: B-/B",6,0,0,17 June 2020
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Entertaining romcom marred by incongruent porn-ish elements
","RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Nicholas Stoller, 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is a romcom starring Jason Segel as Peter, a genial musician from Los Angeles who composes music for a popular detective show, which stars his hottie girlfriend, the titular Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). After she breaks up with him he vacations at a resort in Hawaii where, unexpectedly, his ex & her rock star beau (Russell Brand) also happen to be staying. Mila Kunis plays a concierge at the resort who takes interest in Peter. This is a compelling, amusing romantic comedy with Segel likable as the protagonist and Bell winsome and charismatic as his ex. Brand is great as a Jim Morrison-like rock god who doesn't drink; the way he performs on stage is laugh-out-loud funny (poking fun at rock stars). The resort locations are a highlight and the story is sprinkled with several notable guest stars (Bill Hader, Jack McBrayer, Maria Thayer, Taylor Wily, Paul Rudd, Da'Vone McDonald, Jonah Hill, etc.).Unfortunately, there are several NC-17 (aka porn-ish) scenes that I wasn't expecting since the version I watched was supposedly rated 'R.' I'm talking about several scenes of simulated sex, including one involving fellatio, as well as full-frontal male nudity right out of the gate (Seriously?). I basically ignored these scenes or rolled with them and laughed. I'm sharing this info for those who don't care to see a movie mixed with nigh-porn elements. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 51 minutes and was shot in O'ahu, Hawaii, and Los Angeles, as well as studio work done at Universal City, CA. WRITER: Jason Segel.

The Hunger Games," Worthwhile dystopian adventure
","Released to theaters in March, 2012, 'The Hunger Games' is a post-apocalyptic film based on Suzanne Collins' popular book. A new nation, Panem, exists in North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government, which hosts the 'hunger games' annually, a brutal reality show featuring 24 contestants from Panem's 12 subjugated districts. The contestants, called 'tributes,' range from ages 12-18 and there can only be one winner since it's a survival fight to the death! The first thing that impressed me was the realistic air and overall ambiance of the film, as well as the entire dystopian concept and story set-up.Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as the two 'tributes' from District 12, Katniss and Peeta, are quality protagonists and I like the ambiguity of their feelings – are they for real or for show.Lenny Kravitz stands out as one of the few caring characters from the Capitol, while Woody Harrelson is effective as the drunken adviser to the tributes, a past victor of the hunger games. Also on hand are Elizabeth banks, as the creepy but sorta winsome host of the District 12 tributes; Donald Sutherland as Panem's dictatorial president; and Wes Bentley as his right-hand man with a beard Satan himself would covet.For me, the weak point of the film is the long third act, which constitutes the hunger games themselves, a fight-to-the-death in the forested wilderness (shot in the mountains of Western North Carolina). I anticipated this to be the best part, especially since I love survival stories and the wilderness, but it just wasn't as suspenseful or thrilling as it could have been. At the same time, it wasn't bad. The additions of the dubious 'mockingjay' sequence and artificial horror-dogs who for some strange reason can't overtake the protagonists mar the film.I thought the name of the nation -- Panem -- was really strange, until I discovered that 'Panem' means 'bread' in Latin, as in the popular phrase 'bread and circuses' (panem et circenses), which is figurative of superficial appeasement to pacify the masses. In the film, President Snow said something to this effect to Seneca Crane (Bentley). On top of this, the film shows flashbacks of Peeta intentionally burning literal bread and throwing it to the starving Katniss, which saves her. The bread motif appears elsewhere as well: as a parachute offering to Katniss from District 11 to show her their gratitude for her kindness to Rue (Amandla Stenberg) and the bread parachutes given to the tributes that communicated covert information.I was a bit bewildered by the ending, since it left some things up in the air, but I suppose it leaves room for sequels.When the credits began to role a song came on that just blew my mind; my wife motioned to leave, but I couldn't leave my chair while this awe-inspiring tune played. It's 'Abraham's Daughter' by Arcade Fire, an incredible piece. Check it out on youtube.FINAL WORD: If the long third act were better I wouldn't hesitate to give 'The Hunger Games' an A-level rating. As it is, it's a good dystopian adventure with some excellent aspects, like the entire set-up, the protagonists and closing song.The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes.GRADE: B",7,2,7,5 June 2012
Mississippi Burning," Great Deep South drama
","Based on the 1964 civil rights workers' murders in Neshoba County, Mississippi, the film details the investigation of two FBI agents who travel down there to solve the case. One of them (Willem Dafoe) does everything by the book while the other (Gene Hackman) mingles with the people to sniff out the culprits. Their vastly different approaches create tension, but they both have their strengths and weaknesses.This is just a great film about the injustice of one group of smallminded people wanting to suppress another and those who seek a more perfect world.Hackman stands out as the main protagonist, but Dafoe is good as well. Brad Dourif and Frances McDormand play the couple that the Hackman character zeroes in on. He knows the husband is guilty and his wife is the weak link because (1.) she's also oppressed and unhappy, (2.) she sees the injustice going on and doesn't like it, but knows there's realistically little she can do to stop it without incurring the wrath of her husband & his colleagues, and (3.) she enjoys the agent's flirtations and he senses it.The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in the heart of Mississippi.GRADE: A+",10,1,2,24 June 2014
The 13th Warrior," Good Viking Adventure -- Could've Been Great
","The story of 'The 13th Warrior' comes from Michael Crichton's novel 'The Eaters of the Dead' which combines the legend of Beowulf with a historical account of an Arab diplomat who meets and dwells with the Vikings after being banished from his homeland due to an adulterous liaison.Antonio Banderas stars as the Arab while the hulking Vladimir Kulich heads the Viking cast in the Beowulf role of Buliwyf (pronounced in the film BULL-vie). Speaking of Kulich, he would've made for an excellent Mighty Thor back in the day!The plot of the film is great: Once Banderas meets up with the Vikings, they run afoul of a tribe of cannibalistic Neanderthals who masquerade as fearsome bears and live in a mysterious cave complex. Banderas is selected as the lone non-Viking to assist the 12 Norsemen in ridding the communities of the threat, hence 'the 13th warrior.' The cast, characters, story, locations (Campbell River, Vancouver Island), sets, costumes, score (Jerry Goldsmith), and cinematography are all of the highest order.At a little over an hour and a half the film moves along briskly with a lot of action. Make no mistake, 'The 13th Warrior' is put together extremely well -- this is a Class A film all the way -- but some story elements seem to be underdeveloped. This is probably due to the conflict Michael Crichton had with director John McTiernan. Crichton insisted on reshoots and cut at least 30 minutes of McTiernan's work, reportedly important character-developing scenes.We see this in the very prologue of the film: The story of Banderas' banishment from his homeland due to his indiscretions is literally relayed in a matter of a couple minutes. And at the 8 minute mark we are introduced to the Vikings with very little mystery and zero suspense build-up. The contrast of the sophisticated Arab culture with the coarse, rugged Norsemen is great, but I would have enjoyed seeing these characters fleshed-out a bit more. After all, the more we know the individuals, the more we care about what ultimately happens to them.Which brings us to the final 30 minutes of the film involving Banderas and the Vikings infiltrating the cannibal's cave stronghold and a final Neanderthal attack on a Viking village. The visuals of these scenes are awe-inspiring but they fly by so quickly that the viewer is left disoriented and strangely uninvolved, not to mention unmoved by the story's outcome.All this reveals that 'The 13th Warrior' COULD have been an outstanding 140-minute Viking epic, along the lines of 'Troy,' 'Braveheart' or 'Gladiator;' instead we are left with a brisk, action-oriented, near-throwaway Viking popcorn flick. I would love to see a Director's Cut some day but Vladimir Kulich opines that it will unfortunately never happen.Nonetheless, I appreciate the film as is. It's a good Viking adventure flick that's very professionally put together, despite the post-production problems. It's one of those films that gets better with each viewing, probably because everything flies by so quickly on initial plays.Despite it's flaws, 'The 13th Warrior' isn't too far from rivaling Kirk Douglas' brilliant 1958 'The Vikings' as the greatest Viking film ever made (of course, there aren't many). A Director's Cut could possibly even topple 'The Vikings' from its lofty, coveted perch. Better than both though is the awesome TV series 'Vikings' that started in 2013.The film was shot in British Columbia: Campbell River on Vancouver Island, Williams Lake and Pemberton, British Columbia.GRADE: B-",6,1,4,11 March 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An okay goofy pirate adventure, but kinda boring and forgettable
","I don't go to the theater too often. A film really has to light my fire to get me to actually go out and see it. Well, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' got me interested enough to go see it when it was released in the summer of 2003. Why was I so interested? Probably because I occasionally enjoy fun adventure films in the manner of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981) or 'The Mummy' (1999). 'Black Pearl' is a film of this ilk.WHAT WORKS: The film looks and sounds great, which includes the actors, costuming, cinematography, locations and score. Johnny Depp as pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow is a notable character; Sparrow comes off as a young Keith Richards gone Pirate. Keira Knightley is beautiful as Elizabeth Swann; and Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom & Lee Arenberg are all fabulous in their roles.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: When I first saw it in 2003 the film struck me as too long for such lightweight fare (2 hours and 23 minutes). It also struck me as boring and forgettable for some reason. I decided to see it again recently and came away feeling the exact same way. What makes it boring and forgettable? I don't know, it's hard to pinpoint. Maybe because it's too drawn-out; light film fare like this works best at around 80-95 minutes. Maybe it's because many of the characters are unable to die because of the curse, which naturally creates a lack of suspense. Mostly it's because the story and characters, although fun, are absurd and superficial. Also, I suppose it's too much to expect to glean some morsel of depth or truth from a film like this.CONCLUSION: 'Black Pearl' is a fun, goofy pirate adventure; it's okay but far from great like, say, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or even the 1999 version of 'The Mummy.' It's overlong, overly light, kinda boring and ultimately forgettable. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not a fan and can't recommend it, except maybe to kids. But if it trips your trigger that's great.GRADE: C+",5,5,10,13 March 2014
The English Patient," Romance, drama and adventure
","Remember the Seinfeld episode wherein Elaine Benes proclaimed how lousy and slow this movie was? ('Why don't you just diiieee!') Well, that was enough to prevent me from seeing 'The English Patient,' until recently, that is. I finally decided to kick back and watch the film to see for myself if it was as bad as Elaine said it was (or as good as so many others contended).First of all, the film isn't nearly as long as rumored; it's only two hours and twenty minutes (not including the end credits). Compare that to, say, 'Titanic' which is almost an hour longer or 'Lawrence of Arabia' which is an hour and a half longer.Secondly, as long as one is psychologically prepared to see a drama/adventure flick and not an action film, the story sustains interest quite well. Some sequences are slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Needless to say, if you're a big fan of 'Armageddon' -- essentially a two and a half hour trailer with its never-ending quick (and irritating) edits -- you will not like this flick.One might criticize the ignoble and unfaithful character of the lead players. While this is understandable, I don't feel the movie justifies or glorifies their actions -- it's simply a story about REAL people with REAL flaws who make REAL mistakes (just like you and me) and must suffer the consequences. And suffer they do. Besides, there are some highly likable and noble characters in the cast, like Kip and Hana.In light of the criticism of how long and boring this flick is, I was delighted to discover quite a few scenes filled with suspense, action and high-adventure. For example, the plane crash scene (the second one), the desert storm sequence, the bomb-about-to-explode episode and the fight-to-the-death in the train scene, just to name a few.As many reviewers note, the desert cinematography is marvelous; in fact, the movie is worth seeing for this alone.BOTTOM LINE: 'The English Patient' has elements of 'Lawrence of Arabia,' 'The Bridges of Madison County' and 'A Passage to India;' if you're a fan of the style, pace and realism of these movies then 'The English Patient' is for you.GRADE: B+",7,0,1,12 March 2014
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Fun Persian adventure is spectacular, but convoluted with no depth
","Released in 2010 and directed by Jim Mike Newell, 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' stars Jake Gyllenhaal as an adopted son of the king of Persia and Gemma Arterton as a princess of a nearby kingdom. They team-up after the former becomes a fugitive with a magic dagger. Ben Kingsley, Richard Coyle, Toby Kebbell, Alfred Molina and Steve Toussaint have supporting roles.Based on the video game, this was supposed to be the start of a franchise in the mold of the Pirates of the Caribbean flicks, but it was not to be due to disappointing box office results. The first 45-50 minutes are great, reminiscent of the various Sinbad movies but with no-seafaring, way more action and all-around superior production values. It's like the Conan the Barbarian films, but less dour and brooding; sorta akin to 'The Mummy' (1999) and 'The Mummy Returns' (2001). Like my title blurb says, 'Prince of Persia' is spectacular as far as production quality goes, but after the first 50 minutes it goes downhill with a needlessly convoluted plot and one action scene after another. There are a lot of amusing and 'exciting' things going on, but the story fails to hook; everything morphs into a tedious blur. On the positive side, Jake's a heroic protagonist and Gemma is ravishing in an offbeat way, although the filmmakers shoulda taken more advantage of her presence.The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in Morocco.GRADE: C+",5,0,2,12 November 2016

Rosemary Harris returns as Aunt May while James Franco returns as Harry Osborn. There's this ongoing myth that 'Spider-Man 2' is a great movie. While Doc Ock is excellently realized the movie is severely flawed by two subplots: Since when are Spider-Man's powers dependent upon Peter's confidence level? He received them via a radioactive spider bite, which has nothing to do with faith/belief.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A Top Superhero flick
","I admit that 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' started out pretty shaky with the cartoony action sequence after the opening credits (Stryker's force raiding a facility in Nigeria), but the film found its footing and kicked total axx. I like it for the most basic reason people like movies: The story and its characters pulled me in and kept my attention; I was entertained, pure and simple. How so? For one thing, the movie effectively accomplished precisely what it set out to do – unveil Wolverine's origin. It shows Logan's early family, however brief; it establishes his relationship with his brother, Victor; it shows his participation in all the American wars since the Civil War in an excellent opening credits sequence; it establishes his relationship with Stryker and the US government; it shows his inner conflict between universal morality and being an animalistic killing machine; it establishes his capacity for true love and heroism (Kayla and the old couple, as well as going back to save the mutants at the end); it shows how his bones became reinforced with adamantium; it effectively shows how he lost his memory; and why he's known as Logan/Wolverine.This isn't some mindless action/CGI flick with little dramatic valleys or depth, as some have criticized. As just noted, the film starts out with a dramatic sequence from Logan's youth and proceeds with the dramatic montage of various wars during the opening credits. This effectively sets the tone that 'Wolverine' is a serious superhero film, like the three X-Men films before it. From there we get touching moments with Kayla, both early in the story and later; as well as dramatic lulls with Victor, Stryker, the old couple, the black guy in New Orleans (I forget his name), Gambit, Cyclops and Professor X.As far as depth goes, we get Wolvie's intense struggle between flesh and spirit, which we can all relate to one way or another – will he selfishly and greedily use his powers to be a moral-less killing machine at Stryker's beck & call or will he use his powers for the good of humanity? Will he take the high pay from the government or will he be content making $18,500 as a lumberjack? We also get his discovery of love with a moving relationship with Kayla, his later struggle with betrayal, and then understanding and forgiveness for Kayla's plight (her concern for her sister). Not to mention a certain character's powerful admission of genuine love at the end. Furthermore we get Victor's headfirst plunge into lawlessness with zero respect for life other than his own but then – surprisingly – evidence that he still possesses a sense of loyalty to his blood kin. This shows that even one of the main villains isn't one-dimensional. In addition, near the end we see Cyclops as a boy trusting the still small voice he hears somewhere within, which leads to salvation and Xavier, an obvious type of the Holy Spirit or what have you.One aspect I really liked was the build-up of mystery regarding Stryker's 'island' lab for mutant experimentation. When Wolvie & Gambit fly over it and it's location is finally revealed it's a thrilling revelation. From there the final act just builds to an explosive climax with the creative destruction of something, the deliverance of the mutants and the revelation of how Logan completely lost his memory.As far as all the criticism about Wolvie's claws, particularly in the bathroom scene, so they look a little cartoony, so what? They're obviously a reflection of the comic medium of which the film is adopting. Let me end by addressing some other common criticisms: The helicopter explosion: This was thrown-in for the explosion and simply to show Wolvie's ultra-coolness. Logan would have no concern about the explosion due to his mutant healing factor; after over 150 years – so many wars and so many mortal wounds – such an experience was now mundane.The dialogue in the non-action scenes: I thought a lot of this dialogue was witty and busted out laughing 7-10 times during the film. As far as the verbiage being weak, it's a Wolverine flick where most of the characters are warriors or kids, not James Fenimore Cooper.Kayla's moon parable: This was worth it just for the hilarious 'Koo-koo-ka-choo' line and I found it a very creative touch. Not only does the legend link to Logan & Kayla's relationship, including Logan accusing her of being the 'trickster' later in the film, it provides Logan his namesake, Wolverine! In short, it wasn't some worthless tale thrown in just to show Kayla was Native American.Criticisms about Deadpool: The movie is showing Deadpool's FIRST appearance only; after all, it's 'X-Men ORIGINS.' As far as his twirling head and the laser eyes destroying the tower – how awesome and creative! Film is a visual medium and they knocked it out of the park with this one. As for Deadpool being silenced, stick around for the post-credits scene.The bullet to the brain (SPOILER): This was the perfect way to explain Logan's complete memory loss. Think about it: Being shot in the brain is the closest to death Logan would ever come, but his healing factor kicked in and renewed the damaged brain tissue. His restored brain would be as good as new, but with Logan's memory wiped clean.The inclusion of mutant kids as hostages supposedly just for the fun of putting names there: The movie's called 'Wolverine' so it focuses mainly on him, but it's also called 'X-Men Origins' and so naturally details the very beginning of the X-men. I enjoyed seeing Cyclops as a kid in the film, but I'm glad they didn't take the focus off Wolvie by getting bogged down with Cyclops' story or anyone else's.GRADE A-",9,1,2,10 August 2013
Alexander," Great Movie if You're into Gay Romance
","Are you in the mood for a great historical adventure epic in the manner of 'Troy,' 'Braveheart' or 'Gladiator'? Well, you're not gonna get it with this godawful flick. 'Alexander' is a 3-hour unfocused bore.Worst of all, the viewer has to endure the overlong running time witnessing Alexander (Colin Farrell) and his best friend, Hephaistion (Jared Leto), absurdly exchanging romantic looks at each other throughout the picture. Although they (thankfully) never do more than hug, the flick gives the vibe that it may turn into a gay porn film at any moment.Is this the mighty, world-conquering Alexander the Great -- a whiney, girly-boy who likes men? Writer/director Oliver Stone obviously played the homosexual card to be hip. Sadly, because of Stone's twisted delusions, this is how Alexander is now going to be perceived and remembered by many. If Alexander came back from the grave he'd beat Stone to a pulp for defamation of character.Catch this one only if you're into gay romance fantasy.GRADE: D-",2,2,5,12 March 2014
The Mummy," Indiana Jones Horror Story
","If you think 'The Mummy' (1999) is a remake of the glacial, ultra-serious classic of the same name, think again. This version is just as much an action/adventure (and comedy) as it is horror; and not 'horror' in the sense that it's scary, but rather horrific. Also, be ready for quite a few laugh-out-loud parts.Everything magically works, granting the viewer a highly entertaining romp. Brendan Fraser is perfect as the Indiana Jones wannabe. Rachael Weisz is so cute it's hard to take your eyes off her (WATCH OUT for her opening library scene). Arnold Vosloo is great as the mummy Imhotep and Oded Fehr is memorable as Ardeth Bay, the Magi guardian of the City of the Dead. John Hannah offers some comedic amusing moments as Eve's brother and Kevin J. O'Connor is perfect as a selfish, disloyal, greedy little weasel.'The Mummy' is not great ponderous art as in, say, 'Apocalypse Now' or '2001: A Space Odyssey,' but it is great adventure and horrific fun. On that level, it's filmmaking of the highest order.The movie runs 2 hours, 4 minutes, and was shot in England, Morocco and Glen Canyon, Arizona.GRADE: A-",8,1,1,11 March 2014
The Others," Spectral happenings on an estate in the Channel Islands after WWII (no spoilers)
","RELEASED IN 2001 and written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, 'The Others' is a haunted house flick about a woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in an old manor on one of the Channel Islands with her two photosensitive children immediately after WWII. After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there's a one-dimensional pale 'look' to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.Everything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid.

Troy," 'Where does it end?' -- 'It never ends.'
","If Homer's mythical epic 'The Iliad' is based on a factual story, that story is magnificently depicted in Wolfgang Petersen's 2004 epic 'Troy.' In other words, don't expect any goofy 'gods' or 'goddesses' like Athena popping out of thin air because 'Troy' is a realistic portrayal of the Trojan war.More than that, 'Troy' is arguably the best sword & sandal epic ever put to film. You name the picture -- 'Samson and Delilah,' 'Spartacus,' 'Ben-Hur,' 'Ulysses,' 'The Viking Queen,' 'Conan the Barbarian,' 'Braveheart,' 'Attila,' 'The Odyssey,' 'Gladiator,' etc. -- 'Troy' is superior. At the very least it's as good as some of the better flicks just noted, like 'Ben-Hur,' and far edges out 'Spartacus' and 'Samson and Delilah.' As for more recent sword & sandal epics, like the overrated 'Braveheart' or 'Gladiator,' 'Troy' blows 'em out of the water.Roger Ebert is a great writer and critic, but his mediocre review of 'Troy' is all wrong. Ebert's major criticisms, believe it or not, are the main reasons I have such high respect for this film: He complains that Petersen omitted the many Greek 'gods' & 'goddesses' and gripes that the actors perform their roles as believable people and not larger-than-life caricatures. This can, of course, be respectably done, as in the 1955 film 'Ulysses,' but this is not what Petersen was shooting for in 'Troy.' His goal, as already noted, was to depict the actual Trojan War on which Homer's myth is based. (Even if it never really took place, wars LIKE IT did).Regarding Brad Pitt's heavily criticized performance as Achilles, I couldn't care less about Pitt until seeing this movie as he does an outstanding job portraying Greece's greatest warrior. No, he's not the bulkiest warrior to ever grace the earth, but he's fast as lightning, confident, expertly skilled and deadly accurate. Even his voice completely fits the role. Eric Bana (from 'Hulk') is also great as Hector, Achilles' Trojan counterpart, who's sick of war and just wants to live a life of peace with his family. These two have a showdown in the film and it is without a doubt the greatest mano-a-mano sword & sandal duel ever filmed.What's interesting about the picture is that you never really end up rooting for one side or the other. When Achilles and Hector have their powerful face-off, my wife and I couldn't decide for whom to root. Maybe that's the point. Don't get me wrong, Agamemnon could be viewed as the villain in this picture, and I wasn't rooting for Menelaus when he fights Paris (Orlando Bloom, who seduces Helen, Menelaus' wife), but neither the Greeks nor the Trojans are painted as the 'good guys' or 'bad guys.' They're just people at war, and in war there's no real glory, as Hector points out... and it never ends, as Achilles states. An additional point is that living in a state of war is a JOYLESS existence. And both Bana and Pitt get this across well.As for beautiful women, there are only a couple mentionable: Diane Kruger plays Helen, 'the face that launched a thousand ships.' Some have complained that she's too plain for the role, but I disagree. I'm not a fan of hers or anything, but she looks pretty dang sharp to me (not to mention has an impressive behind shot). Besides, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. If Paris deems her worthy of starting a war, who are we to disagree? Also on hand is cutie Rose Byrne who plays Briseis, the virgin priestess whom Achilles converts to the pleasures of the flesh.I should point out that 'Troy' was one of the most expensive pictures ever made at the time and it definitely SHOWS on the screen. Make no mistake, 'Troy' is breath-taking just to WATCH -- the colossal armies, ships and battles are awe-inspiring to behold, not to mention the Maltan and Mexican locations. And the CGI effects are outstanding for the time, not fake-looking like the Rome & Coliseum scenes in 'Gladiator.'Another complaint by Ebert is that the dialogue is lousy; nothing could be further from the truth. There are great pieces of dialogue interspersed throughout, including Achilles' comment that the 'gods' envy people because we're mortal and 'Everything's beautiful because we're doomed.' Thankfully, there's not one goofy one-liner anywhere to be found.James Horner's score should also be mentioned. If you enjoyed the soundtrack of 'The Passion of the Christ' you'll love this one because it's just as good/serious/reverent/powerful. For instance, the intense percussion during Achilles and Hector's showdown is magnificent.Interestingly, Brad Pitt, who plays Achilles, injured his Achilles tendon during shooting. Fitting, no?FINAL WORD: If you're in the mood for a sword & sandal epic, 'Troy' more than fills the bill. The story captivates from the get-to and never lets up the entire 2.5 hour runtime (technically 2 hours, 42 minutes, with credits). It extravagantly visualizes the Trojan War for you, something I never did until seeing this mind-blowing, outstanding piece of cinema.GRADE: A+",10,44,51,11 March 2014
Dead Poets Society," Seize the day; be Exceptional!
","Released in 1989, Peter Weir's 'Dead Poets Society' is one of the most inspiring films ever made. It ranks with my all-time favorite movies.THE STORY: John Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences -- both good and bad.THE CINEMATOGRAPHY AND LOCATIONS are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.WHAT WORKS: For the most part, the film never takes a wrong turn. It captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter.This is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Although Roger Ebert criticized this scene as 'so moving he wanted to throw up,' he's dead wrong. The scene is both unexpected and potent. That such a great writer & critic as Ebert would criticize this scene (and the movie itself) tells me he watches WAY too many movies. He gave that Roadrunner cartoon 'King Kong '05' a perfect rating though (rolling my eyes).The film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: 'the letter kills' (referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school); the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration and spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd by his angry father (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian abuse); and so much more.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well but that's always the case, even with the best of films.POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS:First, there's the objection that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to 'seize the day.' I disagree. The kid really started to 'seize the day' but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, both good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to 'seize the day.' Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. These VARYING results make the story realistic.Another criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were 'homo erotic.' This interpretation could only be derived by an ADULT in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules at a prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with a group of guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. I assure you that not one of us had a gay thought. In the film, in two the cave meetings one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school while the others look on in awe; on a couple of other occasions a couple of the guys bring porn pages of WOMEN. I think that pretty much quells the 'homo-erotic' theory.Most of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look -- but BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action', gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you 'sieze the day'? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.FINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like 'Witness' and 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but 'Dead Poets Society' is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you already have. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.The film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).GRADE: A+",10,0,0,23 May 2011
Terminator Salvation," Action over substance
","The first couple Terminator films are easily two of the greatest sci-fi/action flicks in history. The problem with the third one, more than anything else, was that it was largely just more of the same; and you can only recycle the same plot so many times before it gets stale. This explains the filmmaker's decision to set this 2009 Fourth installment in the post-apocalyptic future where the machine-controlled Skynet is at war with the surviving humans, otherwise known as The Resistance. A few characters from the previous films are featured: An older John Conner (Christian Bale), his dad -- Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) -- who's actually just a teenager here (such are the complexities of time travel) and the T-800 Schwarzenegger Terminator (CGI, of course). Beyond these we get some new characters, the best being Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), followed by Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). Also on hand are Conner's babe Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mute girl named Star and Helena Bonham Carter, who's somehow hooked up with Skynet. On the surface everything is of the highest filmmaking caliber. The problem is there's not enough character development or intriguing respites. So what we end up with is a plot that's merely an excuse to string together a bunch of cool post-apocalyptic action sequences with people who are constantly grim, shouting and killing, people we neither know nor care about. It's like putting on an extreme metal cd that's full of hyper drumming, buzzsaw riffing & screeching/grunting vocals from beginning to end. It's simply too much. There are no valleys to contrast the over-the-top highs and so it cops a samey-sounding, dull vibe. In other words, the very energy and excitement meant to impress & move the consumer backfires due to extreme overkill. That's why they call it 'overKILL.' It's a curious thing but all too true. Be that as it may, there are enough worthwhile elements to give the film a mediocre grade of 'C' <ul><li>Marcus Wright is an intriguing protagonist who thinks there's no good in him until Blair informs him otherwise.</li></ul><ul><li>At about the 45-minute mark there's a good campfire scene in the desert between Marcus and Blair sharing a warm moment in a world gone mad. If the film contained more scenes like this it would have been more effective.</li></ul><ul><li>There's a decent revelation in the second hour concerning one of the main characters.</li></ul><ul><li>Bryce Dallas Howard has a very uniquely beautiful face. She also has better curves now that she's older. (Would I even be mentioning inconsequential stuff like this if the movie were engrossing?)</li></ul><ul><li>There are a some interesting ruminations about the nature of being a human and being a machine, or both. </li></ul>Bottom line: If you love action you'll get it here -- there are motorcycle-bots, fish-bots, giant-bots, flying-bots, Schwarzenegger-bots -- all trying to terminate the protagonists. Strangely none of the myriad action sequences rival the ultra-thrilling ones in the previous three films and it's difficult to discern why beyond the reasons already cited. The first two films successfully captivate the viewer from the get-go and the suspense builds to avalanche proportions. Even the third installment accomplished this to a lesser degree, although the plot was old-hat by that point (2003); still, it was a decent entry. 'Terminator Salvation,' on the other hand, fails to ever truly captivate and instead opts for wall-to-wall action, creating dull overkill. That's too bad, but it has it's moments; it's thankfully not as bad as 'The Mummy Returns' in this regard. Not to mention it'll likely play better on repeat viewings in light of the convoluted plot. The theatrical release runs 115 minutes and the director's cut 118 minutes. The film was shot in New Mexico. Here's how I grade each of the Terminator outings: T1: A+ T2: A+ T3: B+ T4: CT5: C+",5,3,5,8 June 2011
Aquaman," Lame superhero joke no longer
","Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) lives with his father on the Maine Coast, a caretaker of a lighthouse. With the mentorship of Vulko (Willem Dafoe) and the revelations of Mera (Amber Heard) he discovers that he is the half-breed heir to the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. As the rightful successor to the throne, he must tangle with his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to save the surface world from destruction. Meanwhile Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) seeks vengeance on Arthur for the death of his father.'Aquaman' (2018) is a colorful superhero flick featuring a flashy action scene for every 5 minute lull. It's reminiscent of 'Thor' (2011) and 'Thor: The Dark World' (2013), but with spectacular undersea realms instead of Asgard & realms nearby. Yet the drama was better in those movies whereas here it feels like the creators were in a rush to jump to the next action sequence, which might make 'Aquaman' 'thrilling,' but less compelling story-wise.Still, it's very eventful with loads of energy (maybe TOO eventful for its own good). And I liked the balance of underwater scenes to surface scenes with spectacular locations, including the Sahara Desert and Sicily. Meanwhile Amber is stunning as redheaded Mera. Even Nicole Kidman shows up as Arthur's mother, Atlanna. Speaking of Arthur, Momoa is magnificent as the protagonist and will forever change the public's generally weak perception of Aquaman.The film is a bit overlong at 2 hour, 23 minutes; and was shot in Australia (Hastings Point, Amity Point, Southport, Main Beach & Currumbin Beach); Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada; and Morocco (Erfoud & Merzouga).GRADE: B/B-",7,0,0,4 January 2019
X-Men," 'X-Men' laid the foundation for all the great Superhero flicks to come
","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and a small percentage of humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant 'X' gene. Two mutant leaders, who are old friends, take totally contrasting positions: Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a 'Brotherhood of Mutants' with an attitude of superiority. Unfortunately, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality: 'X-Men' (2000), 'X2: X-Men United' (2003) and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006).'X-Men' naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are introduced and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and nobly opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as adolescents Iceman and Pyro. Both groups of mutants meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor, which is the weakest part of the film, but not bad.When 'X-Men' debuted in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since 'Superman' (1978) and 'Superman II' (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the quality of many of those films.The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes with several interesting deleted scenes available.GRADE: A-",8,0,1,10 April 2012
Spider-Man 3," The best of the three?
","I think so. 2007's 'Spider-Man 3' is easily the most entertaining of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks. The first one (2002) was very good but bogged down by the hero's origin story, which becomes uninteresting on repeat viewings; I also wasn't too crazy about the Goblin's helmet (a minor cavil); the second one (2004) featured a great villain, Dr. Octopus, but was horribly marred by two absurd subplots: one that revealed how Peter's spider powers are somehow linked to his confidence level (Huh? I thought he attained his powers through a radioactive spider) and the other concerned Peter revealing his secret identity to a random group of New Yorkers on the subway with the conclusion that they'll keep his identity secret because they're so thankful for his crimefighting heroics -- Why sure! This third installment takes the good elements of the first two films, minus the origin tale & stoo-pid subplots, and goes into total overdrive. What we end up with is easily one of the most entertaining superhero flicks ever made, not to mention it possesses a wealth of spiritual insights, which is a mark of all great films. Some complain that there are too many villains -- the second Green Goblin, the Sandman and Venom -- but weren't the various Green Goblins (or Hobgoblin) and the Osborns always hovering close by Peter/Spidey to some degree in the comics? As for the Sandman, there wasn't enough depth to him to qualify as the sole villain in a feature film blockbuster; hence, the addition of the parasitic alien that becomes Spider-Man's costume for a brief time and, later, possessing Eddie Brock and becoming Venom. On the surface it appears like there would be too much going on and the film would fall prey to overkill, but Raimi is a master filmmaker by this point and somehow makes it all gel. The 2 hours and 20 minute runtime was necessary for this success. Yes, there are a couple of jarring shifts here and there, but wasn't that the way it was in the comics? One minute Peter's involved in some type of drama and a few frames later Spider-Man's saving the city from the latest nutjob in a costume. Like I said, the film delivers on an entertainment level with loads of action, laughs and melodrama. For instance, when Pete gives into the pull of the alien parasite and becomes the Dark Peter it's hilarious and fun. The film would have been effective with just this, but what propels it into the realm of greatness is the depth of the characters and the numerous potent insights into the human condition: <ul><li>Harry Osborn struggles with his hostility and rivalry toward Peter.</li></ul><ul><li>Themes of humble remorse, friendship, faithfulness and sacrifice are touched on.</li></ul><ul><li>The universal conflict of flesh/spirit, id/super-ego is powerfully explored as Peter grapples with his dark side.</li></ul><ul><li>What at first appears to be a lame reinterpretation of Uncle Ben's murder becomes an awesome illustration of the power of honesty, repentance and forgiveness.</li></ul><ul><li>On the surface Peter Parker appears to be the least likely person to be a hero, let a alone superhero. He's kind, meek and physically almost frail. There's absolutely zero machismo posturing with him (until he gives in to the flesh egged on by the alien parasite). And yet he has no qualms about turning on the daring power when required, and then switching it back off once it's no longer necessary. Simply put, Peter Parker is the quintessential male role-model, a gentle and noble evil-fighting warrior. </li></ul>You wouldn't think such potent themes would be effectively addressed in a mere superhero flick, but you'd be wrong. What made Marvel Comics head and shoulders above all other comic brands was not only their creative characters & action, but their maturity and intriguing explorations of morality and the human condition. Even as a 10 year-old boy I was able to clearly see this greatness in Marvel as opposed to other brands (don't get me wrong, other companies had some good stuff as well, it's just that Marvel was in a league of their own). On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy! For Gwen they needed someone with a winsome innocence and a babelicious hotness and Bryce Dallas Howard is a pretty good fit. My only gripe is the constant unmasking of Spider-Man, the Goblin and Venom for the obvious purpose of seeing the actor's faces when they speak. This was annoying and unnecessary. CONCLUSION: 'Spider-Man 3' is easily the best of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks -- it's the most entertaining and it has the most spiritual depth. It ranks with the top superhero films of all time. GRADE: A",9,2,4,23 June 2011
Thor: Ragnarok," 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people'
","RELEASED IN 2017 and directed by Taika Waititi, 'Thor: Ragnarok' covers events in Asgard & surrounding realms when Thor's older sister, Hela (Cate Blanchett), takes over Asgard while the God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth) is banished to a garbage planet run by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). Thor proceeds to put together a dubious team to (try to) take back his home world. Tom Hiddleston plays Loki, Mark Ruffalo Bruce Banner and Tessa Thompson Valkyrie. Anthony Hopkins and Benedict Cumberbatch are also on hand as Odin and Dr. Strange respectively. I'm a fan of the first two Thor flicks, but this one is the best. It has the most compelling plot, the most interesting guest stars, and adds a little more humor to the proceedings while keeping a nice balance between the amusing parts and the serious ones. Some parts are even moving, like The Executioner's story arc (Karl Urban), whilst some are profound (e.g. Odin's revelation about Asgard). Much of the humor is laugh-out-loud funny.Blanchett is utterly badaxx (even hot) as the villainess and, believe it or not, this is the best depiction of the Hulk yet on the screen. He has more dialogue here than in his four previous appearances on the big screen combined (i.e. 'Hulk,' 'The Incredible Hulk,' 'Avengers' and 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'). In addition, the guest appearance by Dr. Strange is exceptional.Like 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016), Marvel just knocked it out of the ballpark with this one. THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 10 minutes.

Match Point," 'Fatal Attraction' for the new millennium (sort of)
","DIRECTOR/WRITER: Woody Allen. RELEASE DATE: January 20, 2006. GENRE: Psychological drama. RUNTIME: 2 hours, 5 minutes. LOCATIONS: London and the English countryside. THE PLOT: Chris (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is an ex-tennis pro from Ireland and Nola (Scarlett Johansson) a struggling sultry actress from Colorado; both are (unconscious?) social climbers attempting to marry into a rich English family. Chris marries Chloe (Emily Mortimer) even though he passionately lusts for Nola, the latter whom ultimately breaks from the family and the UK. When she returns to London Chris reignites their passion, which can only lead to tragedy. And only luck can save him. 'Match Point' is the antithesis of the modern 'blockbuster' and all it's moronic trappings -- there's no quick editing, no CGI, no goofy one-liners, no explosions and no promise of $400 million at the box office. No, 'Match Point' is movie-making based simply on good writing and cinematic storytelling. The first hour plays out like a nigh tedious drama but the second builds momentum like a snowball slowly morphing into an avalanche. Be forewarned, if you don't have the stomach for an hour of soap operatics avoid this movie. For those who do, however, 'Match Point' is rewarding, unpredictable and original. Underpinning the drama is the theme of luck. The film starts out with a tennis ball hitting the top of the net; at that point the ball will fall on one side of the net or the other, depending solely on the luck of the player. At first, this seems unrelated to the story, but wait till the end and you'll see everything connect. It's amazing how good writing & storytelling can create a 'Wow' reaction much more so than the most elaborate overkill action sequence with all its requisite cgi and explosions. I sensed a somewhat sad emptiness in the characters; most of them are neither likable nor unlikable (although Chloe is super-sweet albeit naive), they're just human beings trying to find meaning and fulfillment despite their physical riches or lack thereof. Their innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of religious faith and they search for meaning in the secular world of Dostoevsky, Sophocles, the visual arts and Verdi's operas. Only the mother and main protagonist, Chris, come off unappealing; the mother is just annoyingly snobbish, whereas Chris is so blatantly selfish and flat (not to mention devious) I find it hard to believe any of the characters in the story would find him appealing, let alone worthy of marrying into the family and becoming a prominent part of the business. But this just reveals that they're out of touch with their 'spiritual compass.' What's ironic is I strangely found myself rooting for Chris in the final act, which doesn't make sense since I'm completely opposed to his (lack of) character and what he does (I can't say more because I don't want to spoil the film). This testifies to Mr. Allen's greatness as a filmmaker. Or maybe I temporarily rooted for him because, regardless of the outcome, I realize no one ultimately 'gets away' with anything in life -- lucky or not. The love, I mean lust, scenes between Chris and Nola struck me as ultra-steamy and authentic. This is exactly how a man and woman in illicit passion would secretly go at it. Case in point: the 'rain scene' is potent. Needless to say, 'Match Point' is a must for Scarlett Johansson fans. As to the 'Fatal Attraction' reference: No, you don't have to worry about psycho slasher clichés. 'Match Point' is smarter and more subtle than that.GRADE: A-***SPOILER ALERT*** Someone offered this insight about the story: 'Tennis is a game designed by a creator with a set of rules. You win the point if the ball goes forward or lose the point if the ball falls back. The ring doesn't bounce forward across the other side and into the water and you immediately think Chris has lost the point and will be found out. But since life itself has no designer, and there are no true rules, it turns out that it was actually good luck for Chris because the ring was found by a bum with a history of petty theft and therefore he, not Chris, was thought to be the murderer.'While this is an intriguing insight and legitimate interpretation, it doesn't rule out a Creator or the fact that there are intrinsic moral laws in the physical universe. For instance, if there are no such laws why does Chris almost have a nervous breakdown after committing the murders? After all, if no such laws exist then it's impossible to break them and meaningless to be upset about it if you do. Why does he see non-literal ghosts of the victims? Obviously he broke an ironclad moral law and was now experiencing the guilt thereof. Yes, luck worked in his favor at the end of the story and this is in line with the insight of one of the wisest persons who ever lived: 'I have seen something else under the sun: The race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong, nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned; but time and chance happen to them all' (Ecclesiastes 9:11).Yet, this doesn't preclude the existence of God or that there will be a judgment day in the Supreme Court of the universe. As Christ said, 'There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs.'Simply put, the idea that evil people 'get away' with their crimes is an illusion.",8,4,5,28 January 2011
Midnight in Paris," Magical movie about Paris, making your own 'golden age' and finding the right mate
","RELEASED IN 2011 and written & directed by Woody Allen, 'Midnight in Paris' chronicles events when an American writer (Owen Wison), his hot fiancée (Rachel McAdams) and her parents visit Paris. Incredibly, the nostalgic writer finds himself going back to the 1920s each midnight and meeting iconic artist/writers. Michael Sheen plays a 'pedantic' academic.Allen's movies are the perfect antidote to conventional CGI-laden 'blockbuster' drivel. 'Midnight in Paris' is magical because (1.) Paris is such a charming city, which is thoroughly showcased, including the picturesque prologue, and (2.) the plot involves a fantasy element. Concerning the latter, there were 2 or 3 scenes where I didn't buy what was going on, but it was only for a moment and the movie quickly recovered (remember: movies are supposed to 'take you away' to another place/time/situation and make you believe it through cinematic wizardry). In any case, the morals of the story are commendable and effectively driven home. Woody has a good eye for women without resorting to sleaze. And the charismatic McAdams is showcased in all her jaw-dropping glory; modest Léa Seydoux too, to a lesser degree. The ravishing Marion Cotillard is also on hand in a significant role, but her beauty is diminished by the 1920's look/apparel she's straddled with, but that's not really a problem. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour & 34 minutes and was shot in Paris. ADDITIONAL CAST: Tom Hiddleston, Alison Pill, Corey Stoll, Marcial Di Fonzo Bo, Adrien Brody, David Lowe, Olivier Rabourdin and Kathy Bates.

Sleepy Hollow," Great Spooky Flick for the Fall Season!
","Although I respect Tim Burton as a great filmmaker, I'm generally not a fan of his films; they usually strike me as eminent examples of style over substance (which, in a sense, isn't his fault since he's not usually the writer). Plus the films he usually picks to direct simply aren't my cup of java (for instance, I have no plans to catch 'Edward Scissorhands' anytime soon). But who can deny his talent for visuals and overall production? This guy knows how to make a film LOOK good, that's for sure.As for 'Sleepy Hollow,' this is Burton's stylish 1999 take on Washington Irving's classic tale about Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman starring Johnny Depp as Crane and Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman. The story is set in 1799 and involves Crane, a constable from New York City, sent to the Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of gruesome murders where the victims are decapitated. As usual, Depp is outstanding. He portrays sleuth Ichabod in a very human manner, e.g. he's afraid of spiders and amusingly passes out on occasion.Other than Depp, four things really impress me about this picture: (1.) I love the spooky Fall atmosphere; it obviously takes place sometime in gloomy November. (2.) I always thought the concept of the headless horseman was insipid, but 'Sleepy Hollow' depicts him (it?) in such a horrific/supernatural fashion that he's actually scary, not to mention skilled with weaponry and virtually unstoppable. I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley, or anywhere else for that matter! (3.) Miranda Richardson was almost 41 at the time of filming, but -- man -- is she gorgeous! Nuff said. Christina Ricci also looks great and so does Claire Skinner in a small role. (4.) 'Sleepy Hollow' lacks the goofy vibe that some of Burton's films possess; the material is presented in a respectable, generally serious manner, albeit not as ultra-serious as, say, Hammer horror. Speaking of which, 'Sleepy Hollow' strikes me as a modern Hammer film more than anything else. Maybe that's why Burton gave Christopher Lee a cameo. Needless to say, if you love Hammer -- and who doesn't? -- you'll appreciate 'Sleepy Hollow.'The last half hour or so is packed with action so if your attention starts wandering, don't worry, it picks up big time. The plot's a whodunit and it gets kinda convoluted so you'll need to pay attention. Not that you HAVE to because 'Sleepy Hollow' is such a cinematic feast you can enjoy it even if the complications of the plot lose you.There's nothing else to say except to re-emphasize that 'Sleepy Hollow' is definitely the ideal creep flick for the autumn, or any time really.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot in England and New York.GRADE: A-",8,1,1,11 March 2014
The Hateful Eight," Creative Western whodunit is an amusing black comedy, but also profane and repugnant
","RELEASED IN 2015 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, 'The Hateful Eight' is a Western about a cruel bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) taking an outlaw woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in to Red Rock, Wyoming, to hang. Along with a black bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the new Sheriff of Red Rock (Walton Goggins), they hold up at a rural haberdashery during a blizzard with several dubious characters (Tim Roth, Demián Bichir, Michael Madsen, Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum). Dana Gourrier and Zoe Bell appear in small roles.This was Tarantino's second Western in a row after 2012's 'Django Unchained,' which ranks with the best Westerns of all time. This one's not as good, but it certainly has its points of interest, like the great wintery wilderness atmosphere, which is to die for. Moreover, the plot is intriguing. It's basically an Agatha Christie whodunit a la Murder on the Orient Express transferred to the Old West. Roughly 90% of the film takes place in the haberdashery and, less so, a stagecoach. It's basically a theater play masquerading as a movie and I found it a unique setting for a Western.The movie starts out with spectacular Colorado winter cinematography highlighted by an excellent Ennio Morricone score, his first full-length score in over three decades (!). Compelling extended dialogues have always been Tarantino's strong suit; and so it is here. The amusing melodramatics are entertaining and the story keeps your interest despite the one-dimensional setting. Everything's SO exaggerated that you can't take it seriously. The movie's intentionally offensive and you have to roll WITH the excesses to be entertained; otherwise you'll hate it.On at least one occasion the overindulgences don't work, like the disgusting fellatio sequence. I get that Marquis (Jackson) was lying to the other guy to compel him to draw, but we didn't need a visual on his fabricated story. It's sordid excess that has no place in a Western or any other movie, except gay porn, but Tarantino obviously included it in order to be 'edgy' or whatever.The excellent opening with the figure of Christ dying for our sins keys off the theme, which is humanity's fallen condition and dire need of redemption. The title, 'The Hateful Eight,' is a perversion of 'The Magnificent Seven.' The latter celebrates the noble and heroic whereas this movie parodies the base and odious. Tarantino is poking fun at our petty hostilities that separate us based on race, gender, sectionalism, faction-ism, envy and rivalry. Furthermore, men divided by hatred of culture and race can unite in hatred of something else, in this case misogyny.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 47 minutes.GRADE: B",7,6,13,17 October 2016
Gettysburg," Lazy and Sappy Look at The Civil War's Turning Point Battle
","For a full decade or so I was what you'd call a 'Civil War Buff.' I formally and informally studied the 5-year ultra-bloody engagement. I've been to Antietam in Northern Maryland, the bloodiest single day of the war, Vicksburg, Mississippi, and, of course, Gettysburg (amongst other less significant sites). When I was at Antietam one of the eye-witness quotes was: 'Bodies filled the entire field with every imaginable wound.' I was so overwhelmed tears flowed from my eyes.Why do I bring all this up? I just want you to know how INTO the Civil War I was (and still am, to a lesser degree), not just on an intellectual level, but an emotional one as well.So in December 1993 my then-fiancÃ© and I went to the theater to see the over-four-hour-long 'Gettysburg' with much interest. All I can say is it was VERY DIFFICULT to sit through this entire film in one sitting.'Gettysburg' has a lot going for it: an all-star cast, including Tom Berenger (Longstreat), Martin Sheen (Robert E. Lee), Jeff Daniels (Chamberlain) and Sam Elliott (Buford); great authentic Gettysburg locations; good battle scenes; a commitment to historical accuracy; and thousands upon thousands of Civil War reenactors.The subjects of the Civil War and Gettysburg are immensely interesting. You would think, therefore, that 'Gettysburg' would be overflowing with life, but that's hardly the case. It takes FOREVER for things to get going. Plus there's an undeniably lazy and unexciting feel to the settings and dialogue when the forces aren't actually fighting. One has to REALLY CONCENTRATE to listen to and get through the interminable dialogue. Plus the mawkish melodrama factor is high.Part I is highlighted by Chamberlain's defense of Little Round Top and his mad bayonet charge while Part II ends with the South's infamous Pickett's Charge. Both of these sequences are great and they give the viewer a good feel of what it must have really been like, which is one of the reasons I enjoy seeing historical films.The score is only half good. You'll definitely hear spots of brilliance but way too often it's sickeningly ultra-'heroic' or melodramatic.One aspect I liked was seeing the officers and soldiers pray while standing in line right before significant engagements. Yeah, it's hard to be an atheist when you're about to walk straight into friggin' cannon fire.BOTTOM LINE: There's a lot to respect about 'Gettysburg.' It's a story about war and the men who engage in it, pure and simple. There's no female cast members, no forced romances. Unfortunately it's bloated, melodramatic and just plain lazy. Trust me, the REAL Gettysburg battle was anything BUT lazy and uninteresting. Still, if I concentrate hard to pay attention to the dialogue and non-action events in the film, I get a lot out of it. In other words, if you're braced for its shortcomings it's worth owning or renting. I'm glad I own it. But don't expect something great like, say, 'Glory.' The battle of Gettysburg took place July 1-3, 1863 and was a huge victory for the North, the turning point of the war, in fact (along with Grant's simultaneous siege of Vicksburg). After the failure of Pickett's Charge, General Lee and his troops retreated back to their own territory. The war would go on for another two long years (almost) as the Confederates continued to put up an incredible and courageous fight, but the odds were against them. Gettysburg and Vicksburg were the seeds of their impending doom.General Meade congratulated his men for driving the Confederate invaders from the North's turf. But President Lincoln was upset because he wanted Meade to DESTROY Lee's army, not allow them to safely retreat back to their Southern sanctuary. Lincoln groaned: ' 'Drive the invader from our soil'? My God! is that all?' Four months after the battle of Gettysburg, on November 19th, Lincoln came to the small town and gave his potent 'Gettysburg Address' to honor the fallen soldiers and motivate continued Northern commitment and victory. So many people died at Gettysburg they were STILL burying the dead (!!).GRADE: C",4,2,5,14 March 2014
We Were Soldiers," Square-jawed officers who weep at carnage and fresh-faced GIs who die too young
","Released in 2002, 'We Were Soldiers' stars Mel Gibson as Col. Hal Moore who leads the first major battle between Americans and the North Vietnamese Army in The Battle of Ia Drang Valley over four days in mid-November, 1965. Sam Elliott costars as the seasoned NCO and Barry Pepper as a bold photographer while Madeleine Stowe appears as the Colonel's wife. Greg Kinnear is also on hand as a helicopter pilot while Keri Russell plays a soldier's wife.The movie is based on the book 'We Were Soldiers Once and Young' by Col. Moore and the aforementioned photographer, Joe Galloway. As such, 'We Were Soldiers' is a straight-forward realistic depiction of the battle and the first film depiction where Moore claimed 'Hollywood finally got it right.' This reminds me of something someone I know who fought in Nam said: All the other films about the war from the late 70s to late 80s didn't strike him as the way it really was, but after seeing 'We Were Soldiers' he said, 'That's the way it was.' Be that as it may, it doesn't make it as good as 1986' 'Platoon' or 1979's 'Apocalypse Now.' The former is so great because the platoon in the story is a microcosm of many platoons and their experiences throughout the war, which might come across as 'too much' because the filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame. Incredibly, 'Platoon' fleshes-out no less than a dozen memorable characters with its grunt's-eye view of the conflict while telling a compelling story. By contrast, 'We Were Soldiers' only presents about four memorable characters during the battle and, while it's a solid war flick, it simply isn't as compelling.As for 'Apocalypse Now,' it's useless to compare the two because (1.) the original version of 'Apocalypse Now' (as opposed to the horribly flawed 'Redux') is a downright cinematic masterpiece; (2.) it's way more than just a war movie; and (3.) its theme is deeper than the conventional and patriotic portrayal of the realistic 'We Were Soldiers.' If you're not familiar with the theme of 'Apocalypse Now,' it's basically this: Capt. Willard (Sheen) comes face-to-face with two Colonels during his mission up the river to assassinate the rogue Col. Kurtz. Both of the colonel's names start with 'K,' which is no accident. Col. Kilgore (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he 'loves the smell of napalm in the morning.' War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war. Col. Kurtz (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard.'We Were Soldiers' instead opts for a simple portrayal of the first major battle of the infamous war and the bravery & horror thereof. The story essentially proposes the question: What would happen if you drop 400 American soldiers into a valley crawling with 4000 soldiers of the NVA? The fighting is presented realistically, brutally and relatively coherently given the chaos of the intense conflict. Col. Moore truly loves his men and Gibson carries the movie with the peripheral help of Elliot and Barry Pepper. On top of this, the movie gives quite a bit of time to North Vietnamese side of the story, which enhances the story.Some people have rolled their eyes at the Morro Bay locations of central coastal, California, but if you look at Galloway's real-life pics of the battle they chose a great stand-in for the grassy valley. I guess people don't realize that Vietnam isn't all conventionally tropical jungle.The film runs a little overlong at 2 hours and 18 minutes and was shot in Morro Bay, Pasadena and Fort Hunter Liggett, California; as well as Fort Benning and Columbus, Georgia.GRADE: B- (6.5/10 Stars)",6,0,0,7 January 2016
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Newman and Redford in arguably the first modern Western
","Released is 1969 and directed by George Roy Hill, 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the eponymous outlaws and key members of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang headquartered near Dubois, Wyoming. After robbing one train too many, the head of Union Pacific hires a six-man team of skilled lawmen to apprehend the duo and so they flee to Bolivia with Sundance's lover & schoolteacher, Etta (Katharine Ross). Strother Martin, Ted Cassidy, Jeff Corey and Cloris Leachman are featured in peripheral roles.The gist of the story is historically accurate, with the movie starting in the late 1890s and ending with the outlaws' deaths in November, 1908, which means the picture encompasses about 9-10 years, although it seems more like a couple of years. In any case, this was a state-of-the-art Western when it was released and a huge success at the box office. The production quality, tone and theme are comparable to 1967's 'Bonnie and Clyde.' It's a very 'modern' Western, arguably the first (although a good case could be made for 1967's 'Hombre'), and therefore holds up well today, hardly seeming dated; that is, disregarding 'Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head,' which plays during an interlude at the end of the first act. In spirit, the movie inspired future great modern Westerns like 'The Missouri Breaks' (1976), 'The Long Riders' (1980) and 'Unforgiven' (1992), all superlative Westerns that don't seem to age as the decades pass.While Redford was already appearing in significant movies, this is the one that shot him to stardom and he went on to star in notable Westerns like 'Tell Them Willie Boy is Here' (1969), 'Jeremiah Johnson' (1972) and the great 'The Electric Horseman' (1979), the latter taking place in the modern day, of course. As for Newman, it's hard to believe he's the same actor that starred in the aforementioned 'Hombre,' as his character couldn't be any more different as Butch Cassidy, a fun-loving, witty train robber (in 'Hombre' he's the opposite: a laconic, mirthless white man raised by Apaches).Although the tone is similar to 'Bonnie and Clyde,' I don't think it's on the level of that film. I also don't understand the gushing it often receives. Yes, it's good, but at the end of the day, it's about two thugs who were on a collision course with premature death due to their own folly. Newman and Redford are entertaining as the pair, but it's hard to sympathize with fools who stubbornly insist on carrying on their idiotic thuggery even though they have the awesome opportunity to start a new life.There are two sequels worth checking out: 'Wanted: The Sundance Woman,' a 1976 TV movie starring Katherine Ross, which shows what happens to Etta after leaving the duo for America; and, especially, 'Blackthorn,' a 2011 release starring Sam Shepherd as Butch Cassidy in his old age in Bolivia, which presupposes that he somehow survived the ending of this movie.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and California. The script was written by William Goldman.GRADE: B",7,1,2,9 June 2017
Crash," Provocative psychological drama
","THE STORY: Peoples of differing ethnicities and social-economic levels 'crash' into each other in Los Angeles over a two-day period. These people include: <ul><li>A white cop who's angry over the downside of affirmative action and abuses his authority (Matt Dillon).</li></ul><ul><li>His young white partner who objects to the abuse and actively tries to counteract it (Ryan Phillipe).</li></ul><ul><li>A black TV director who feels emasculated over the racism he experiences and ultimately blows up (Terrence Howard).</li></ul><ul><li>His light-skinned wife who doesn't know when to shutteth up (Thandie Newton).</li></ul><ul><li>An Hispanic locksmith (Michael Peña) and his young daughter with an 'invisible bullet-proof cloak.'</li></ul><ul><li>A Persian shopkeeper who needs a scapegoat after his store is horribly vandalized, not to mention his daughter and wife.</li></ul><ul><li>Two black car thieves (Ludacris and Larenz Tate), the latter the younger brother of a detective, Graham (Don Cheadle).</li></ul><ul><li>Graham's beautiful partner and bedmate, Ria (Jennifer Esposito), and her mother, a maid to...</li></ul><ul><li>The District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock).</li></ul><ul><li>An Asian man who gets hospitalized and his frantic wife racing to see whether he's alive or dead. </li></ul>'Crash' is reminiscent of another L.A. drama, the 1991 masterpiece 'Grand Canyon,' but has enough nuances to stand on its own. For one thing, 'Crash' is even more serious and dark. As you can see above, this is a very involved story with numerous interwoven story lines; it ain't no mindless popcorn 'blockbuster.' A casual viewing won't cut it. It's not that type of picture. Most of the negative criticisms about the film are by people who didn't watch closely and then lambaste the film with criticisms that aren't even legitimate.For one thing, the film is about so much more than racism; it also addresses stereotypes, hypocrites, the capacity for good and bad in every human soul, second chances, passive correction and shame, self-sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness, abuse of power, the last straw, manhood & emasculation, giving someone a break, true friendship, misunderstandings, favoritism and more. *** SPOILER ALERT *** Furthermore, not every character is racist as some critics insist. Brendan Fraser's character never shows any racism and the only reason his wife (Bullock) blows up with racially-charged statements concerning the locksmith is because she just got robbed and shoved to the pavement at gunpoint by two young black guys. How would you or I react after such an experience? Also, Matt Dillon's cop partner never displays racism in the truest sense; why else would he radically come to the defense of the director who has a fit or pick up a young black male hitchhiking? (What happens later is a misunderstanding not real racism). What about the detectives Graham and Ria and Ria's housemaid mother? (Yes, Graham makes one derogatory statement about Hispanics, but that's it; he's hardly racist). These are all main characters. Then there's the criticism that all the protagonists are 'essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes.' This is completely untrue. Graham and Ria (black and Hispanic) are successful detectives; Cameron is a successful black TV director; and the Hispanic locksmith is a family-oriented working man, not a criminal or gangbanger. Yes, there are some people who fit the stereotypes, like the two young black male thieves and the racist/abusive white cop, but one of the thieves becomes shamed for his lifestyle & hypocrisy and the racist cop is willing to risk his life for a woman of color, thus redeeming himself (from the guilt he felt over abusing his power the night before), besides his white partner is anything but a white racist who abuses his authority. I could go on but this is enough. One critic criticized the film with this multiple-choice question: 'You are involved in a car accident on a busy street. The other driver is Asian. Do you: a) Wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay. b) Exchange insurance information with the other driver. c) Scream and yell, 'damn chinks don't know how to drive!' 'If you picked C, you'd love Crash.' This car-crash scenario DOES take place in the story, but he's leaving out some important details -- A woman & man are rear-ended by an Asian lady. Why don't they call the cops? Because they ARE cops and there are other cops on the scene. Why does the lady detective talk back to the Asian woman? Because the Asian woman is having a fit and throwing racial slurs (she's Hispanic). This is WHY she talks back to the Asian woman, not to mention she's a cop and therefore in a position of authority. Why does the Asian woman have a fit anyway? Because she's rushing to the hospital to see if her husband's alive or not. So, you see, the witty little multiple-choice question doesn't actually fit the reality of the film. *** END SPOILER *** Another criticism is that the racism in the story is not subtle like it is in real life. Well, haven't you ever seen anyone blow up like in the movie? I have. In a city as big as L.A. how many such blow ups happen over any 48-hour period? Yes, there's a lot of raw emotion and hard-to-watch scenes, but there are undeniable glimpses of love, hope, redemption and forgiveness as well. If you're in the mood for a well-made psychological drama with numerous insights to the human condition, don't miss out on 'Crash.'",9,0,3,7 June 2011
The Beach," It's... different.
","I watched 'The Beach' shortly after it came out in 2000 and it left me kind of perplexed, although I was fairly entertained and the story kept my interest.The story involves an American youth, Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), traveling in Thailand who learns of a paradisical beach hidden on an island off the coast many miles away. He ends up hooking up with a French couple and they travel to the island together.The reason 'The Beach' leaves people a little puzzled is because it's so many thing. It's an adventure, a drama, a romantic triangle and an art house film with existential commentary. But somehow it all comes together and works as a whole, sort of.The beach community is somewhat of a modern hippie commune. Even the most equalitarian communities have a leader or leaders. In this case it's Sal (Tilda Swinton). Richard realizes he'll have to maintain her favor in order to remain in the paradise, even if her subtle demands are disrespectful and ultimately authoritarian. Since The Beach community is a paradise, anything that takes away from their sense of bliss must be removed. As they say, out of sight out of mind.Shot in Thailand, the film runs 2 hours.FINAL WORD: 'The Beach' is an unusual film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. There's really nothing else like it. And it's worthy of repeat viewings.GRADE: B+",7,1,3,20 June 2013

Final Destination 2," Solid sequel, maybe a notch better than the first film
","The first 'Final Destination' movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper, as an invisible spiritual presence. A group of people, mostly youths, escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways, usually involving an unlikely chain reaction. The opening tragedy in the first film was a plane crash; in this second film from 2003 it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.There are currently five films in the franchise and they all tell the same basic story with different characters and some nuances; they're all of the same high quality of technical filmmaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same, although the fifth film throws in an interesting new twist (Death's victim can find a substitute).Ali Larter returns as a secondary protagonist while A.J. Cook takes the reigns of the 'final girl.' Keegan Connor Tracy also has a considerable role in the female department while Sarah Carter has a smaller part. While this is a quality assortment of women, the creators coulda done more with them. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum Michael Landes stars as a state trooper. Jonathan Cherry, Terrence 'T.C.' Carson and James Kirk are also on hand. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his second of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.I actually like this one a little better than the first one, but like that film, the second half isn't as strong as the first. Is the final scene supposed to be horrific? Cuz it made me bust out laughing.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area, including Campbell River (although the events take place around New York City).GRADE: B/B-",7,0,1,31 October 2018
The Way Back," Better to die free than live under the shackles of communism
","'The Way Back' (2010) takes place circa 1940-42 and details a group's mad escape from a Siberian gulag through the cold, desolate Soviet wilderness into Mongolia, across the great Gobi desert, through mountainous Tibet and ultimately freedom in India. The film was inspired by Slavomir Rawicz' popular book 'The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom,' but not based on it.After records of Rawicz' release from the gulag by the USSR in 1942 were unearthed the veracity of the book was called into question; others suggest that, although the circumstances of the story may not have happened to author Rawicz, they're apparently based on real events with real individuals, like Polish soldier Witold Glinski.Moreover, in light of the millions of prisoners carted away to Siberia during that time period, isn't it likely that a handful of them successfully escaped and had experiences similar to those shown in this movie (and the book) regardless of whether or not they made it all the way to India? In any event, director Peter Weir has plainly stated that the film is largely fictional and only inspired by the book, which may or may not be a true account.The group's natural leader is Janusz (Jim Sturgess), not because he has any leadership charisma but simply because he spent half his life in the woods and KNOWS how to survive in such an environment. As Solomon said, 'A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge increases strength.'Also along for the haul is a cynical American called Mister Smith (Ed Harris), a Russian hooligan named Valka (Colin Farrell), a comic accountant, an artistic pastry chef, a priest, a Pole with night blindness and a teen-aged girl named Irena, played by Saoirse Ronan, who incidentally celebrated her 16th birthday on the set.This a story of survival. The group faces freezing nights, lack of food & water, bugs, death, the never-ending Gobi desert and the Himalayas, not to mention the inevitable moral questions that arise from such a life or death situation. Some have complained that the film involves too much walking, but that's the whole point: the film's about a 4000-mile escape on foot to freedom.It drives home some powerful messages that will be pondered well after viewing:<ul><li>The government in communistic or extreme socialistic states is a cold, uncaring, demonic machine that will immediately squelch dissidents through any measure possible, including torturous coercion, slander and execution.</li><li>Such godless governments are a vile social infection that spreads and must be escaped at all costs.</li><li>Is this socialistic disease now spreading to America? Of course it is and it's been obvious for quite some time (the Dems).</li><li>Better to die free than live in a gulag (aka labor camp or reeducation camp) or under dictatorial socialistic governments.</li><li>No matter how bad it is, at least you don't have to live in a gulag.</li><li>Mongolians and Tibetans are people of true honor.</li><li>Saoirse Ronan is a precious young lady.</li></ul>In addition, the film features a great score and spectacular locations, shot in Bulgaria, Morocco and India.FINAL WORD: 'The Way Back' is a must if you love survival stories like 'Flight of the Phoenix' (especially the original version) or 'Sands of the Kalahari,' as well as films like 'Lawrence of Arabia,' 'Black Robe' and 'Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Khan.' It's unique but it has the same general tone. Stay away if you have ADHD or solely relish films with conventional Hollywood plotting and roll-your-eyes BS, not that there's anything wrong with that, lol.RUNTIME: 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A-",8,2,5,23 May 2012
The Doors," A hypnotic film, but it emphasizes the negative side of Jim Morrison and is filled with fabrications
","RELEASED IN 1991 and directed by Oliver Stone, 'The Doors' chronicles the Southern California band The Doors and their rise and fall between 1966-1971. The film focuses on charismatic singer Jim Morrison (Val Kilmer) who falls into alcoholism and drug-addiction. He flew to France in March, 1971, to join his girlfriend, Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan), and pursue a different career, but died the next summer due to his ongoing substance abuse. The other band members are played by Kyle MacLachlan (Ray Manzarek), Frank Whaley (Robby Krieger) and Kevin Dillon (John Densmore).I'm not old enough to remember The Doors. The first time I heard of them was when my older brother asked me if I knew of them. I busted out laughing saying, 'The Doors? Why don't they just call themselves The Window Sills.' Yeah, I thought the name was pretty lame until I discovered Morrison's reasoning behind it:There is what is known; And there is what is unknown; In between are the doorsAnother thing that won my respect was their song that was used in the opening of 'Apocalypse Now,' which is my all-time favorite film (the original version, not 'Redux'). After that I bought their 'Best Of' album and my impression was that their sound was horribly dated, even THEN. Over time, however, I've come to respect The Doors' music because it's so unique. They don't sound like anyone else. They have a weird, moody vibe, even their 'hits,' augmented by a strange carnival feel. Over top of it all is Morrison's commanding and haunting vox. I prefer their more artistic songs like 'Riders on the Storm' and 'The End' as opposed to their 'hits,' but who can deny the catchiness of 'Light My Fire' or the goofy charm of 'People are Strange'?The film focuses on Jim Morrison and leaves the viewer with the impression that he was a miserable artistic-genius type who had no sense of moderation; he sought to escape his personal struggle through loose sex, substance misuse and rock 'n' roll. His excessive self-abuse eventually spilled over to those closest to him and ultimately landed him in a premature grave. His body lies in Paris, a mecca to his fans who have spray-painted the surrounding monuments with gaudy graffiti, some of it profane. The image this leaves you with is that Jim Morrison is no fun to be around, even in death.So 'The Doors' is pretty much the ultimate story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. Stone said he based his view of Morrison, as depicted in the film, on 160 transcripts of people that actually knew him or were around him and the band. From these documents emerged a central truth about Morrison's final years, an image of wild excess. Because of this, I was left with a bad impression of the man. I felt Morrison was a spaced-out, immature jerk, abusive to both himself and others, foolishly sacrificing his life and talents on the altar of alcohol & drug idolatry.Yet this was only part of the truth. Thankfully the 37-minute documentary on the 'extras' disc, 'The Road to Excess' (1997), balances things out. One of Morrison's sweethearts, wiccan Patricia Kennealy (played by Kathleen Quinlan in the movie), the guitarist and another guy offer the other side of the story. They properly point out that Stone's film only shows Jim's 'wild & crazy' side, emphasizing that the events depicted in the picture, while sometimes true, aren't 'all that happened.' They unanimously describe Morrison as genuine, innocent, shy, loving and gallant, an amazing person who made those around him feel important, as if he was their best friend. Robby even states that Jim was 'the most influential person I've ever met.'In addition, the documentary features numerous clips of Morrison himself, clearly showing him to be a fun-loving, nice and sane person rather than the spaced-out, abuse-driven dude shown in the film. Needless to say, the documentary helps round-out one's image of the man.BOTTOM LINE: Val Kilmer doesn't just play Jim Morrison, he IS Jim Morrison. This is no small feat and vital to the film in light of the fact that he appears in practically every frame. He should have won an award. In any case, if you're in the mood for something that captures that late-60s counter-culture vibe 'The Doors' is worth checking out, but it tends to exaggerate things in the name of mythmaking, which is usually the case with movies. For instance, Jim never lit up a closet door with Pamela locked inside (rolling my eyes), the idiotic Thanksgiving dinner sequence never happened and the naked revelries at concerts (and the bonfire) are overblown fabrications. Still, the movie's mesmerizing in a spaced-out way and highlighted by The Doors' music throughout. Unfortunately, the first half is superior to the second half, which becomes too unpleasant, offering a very limited and unflattering impression of Morrison. That's why it's essential to also watch 'The Road to Excess' on the bonus disc or, better yet, the excellent 2009 documentary 'The Doors: When You're a Stranger,' which exclusively uses footage and photos from 1966-1971. Another problem with Stone's movie is that it loses its dramatic pull in the second half in preference for hypnotic yet chaotic visual mayhem, not to mention outright lies. Lastly, in 'The Road to Excess' Oliver Stone makes a couple of really asinine statements. Commenting on Morrison, he states: 'To live life intensely and well and die young and achieve everlasting fame & glory is the greatest. It's Achilles, it's Alexander, it's... Jim Morrison.' Huh? Another dubious line is: 'The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom.' Is he on drugs? Jim's road of excess led straight to an early grave, not enlightenment.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours 20 minutes.

The Polar Express," Some kids with creepy dead eyes take a dreamlike trip to the North Pole on The Polar Express
","A boy from Grand Rapids, Michigan, is at the age where he no longer believes in Christmas, as far as Santa, his elves and flying reindeer go, but a magical train appears in front of his home on Christmas Eve and whisks him away on an adventurous trip to the North Pole with several other kids.'The Polar Express' (2004) was based on the 1985 Christmas book and was the first mainline movie to use motion capture animation for all its characters beginning to end (think Gollum from 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy). Some people think the animation is weak, but I feel it creates its own world and has its own charm. It holds up as long as you can adapt to those creepy dead eyes of the characters.Some people love this movie while others think it's weird, like a Twilight Zone Christmas flick. Roger Ebert, for instance, loved it and gave it a perfect grade. I'm sorta in the middle. I see its good points and appreciate them, like the haunting winter ambiance, parts of the trip to the North Pole (e.g. the quasi-rollercoaster ride) and the kids' investigation of the Christmas factory. But there are some meh parts and dubious sections like the whole last act with the multitude of elves and the towering Santa who looked like he was modeled after 6'5' Christopher Lee with a pillow strapped to his mid-section.The movie's interesting in some ways but also quaint in a cheesy way, as well as peculiar and lifeless.The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.GRADE: C",5,1,3,30 November 2018
Elf," Destined to be played on TV every Christmas the rest of your life
","Released in 2003 and directed by Jon Favreau, 'Elf' is a Christmas dramedy/fantasy starring Will Farrell as an orphaned infant who tows away on Santa Claus' sleigh and isn't discovered until he's at the North Pole, where he's adopted by Papa Elf and named Buddy. After growing up as an elf, he travels to New York City to meet his father (James Caan) and he starts a relationship with his neglected younger half-brother (Daniel Tay). Buddy starts a relationship with a department store worker (Zooey Deschanel) and helps spread Christmas cheer as Santa (Ed Asner) arrives to the city.This is an all-around entertaining Christmas flick highlighted by Farrell's goofiness as the quasi-elf.

Lost in Translation," True love transcends sexual expression
","RELEASED IN 2003 and written & directed by Sofia Coppola, 'Lost in Translation' was a big hit in 2003-2004. It's about an aging actor, Bob Harris (Bill Murray), who's in Tokyo doing commercials for a week. His home-life is mundane and he's experiencing a bit of the mid-life crisis. He runs into an attractive 20 year-old something woman, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), who's in Tokyo with her photog husband (), but he's gone most of the time and takes her for granted.This is a mature, semi-arty film and you have to be in the right mode/maturity level to appreciate it. I said 'maturity level' and not 'age' because some people are pretty mature at 16 while others are completely immature at 50. For me, the story, music and visuals pulled me into these characters' temporary world for the 102-minute runtime.The film succeeds as an amusing social commentary and a deep love story, as well as a visual/musical delight. I'll only focus on the deep love element. It's been noted that the story originated from Sofia's experience with an aging actor when she was younger, possibly Harrison Ford. Sofia is obviously Charlotte, while Charlotte's husband is Sofia's ex and Anna Faris plays the role of the other woman, which would be Cameron Diaz in real life. So there's a lot of reality in the picture.But it's not just a cathartic piece. Sofia has some potent insights to offer on the nature of true romantic love. For one, love transcends age difference (Bob is about 35 years older than Charlotte). For another, it's possible to be married and experience romantic love for another. Not that this ever justifies adultery, it's just a fact. As the story progresses you'll see how comfortable Bob and Charlotte are with each other, how they look into each other's eyes, the windows of the soul, in a profoundly naked sense. This can happen in the flash of a moment where the two people just KNOW, or it can take place over a period of time, as is the case with Bob and Charlotte (which is a handful of days). They see the same things and speak the same language, and I don't mean English. But this presents a conundrum for Bob. Bob COULD take advantage of Charlotte because she's so lonely in a sea of people, which is one of the movie's themes; she's also inexperienced and vulnerable. Will he or won't he take advantage? ***SPOILER ALERT*** Don't read further if you haven't seen the film.If Bob loves Charlotte so much, not to mention his wife & kids, why does he have a one-night stand with the lounge singer (Catherine Lambert)? Bob slept with her to release sexual tension that had been building up between him and Charlotte. This was a moral failure, but keep in mind he was drunk (another failure but, have pity, he was going through a mid-life crisis). While all this is obvious, it goes deeper...Bob could have taken advantage of Charlotte if he wanted to but didn't because he genuinely loved her, which is revealed at the end. Bob could sleep with the singer because he didn't love her (not that it justifies his actions). Simply put, true love transcends sexual expression and sexual union does not equal love.The ending is powerful and tear-inducing. No CGI, explosion or action stunt can compare. It's just an older man and a too-young woman embracing in the midst of 20 million strangers. Tears flow, kisses are given and unheard words are whispered. They could never be a couple, even if they weren't married, and they know they'll never see each other again, at least on this physical plane, but their love has been expressed and will be treasured for eternity.GRADE: A",9,2,3,30 August 2011
American Sniper," Tribute to Hero Chris Kyle (R.I.P.)
","Clint Eastwood's 'American Sniper' (2015) is similar to 2014's 'Lone Survivor' in that they're both straight war flicks based on true stories, the former taking place in Iraq and the latter in Afghanistan. While these movies are similar in theme, tone and quality, I give 'American Sniper' the edge.Most reading this realize that Kyle was murdered in 2013, along with Chad Littlefield, as they were helping some piece of sheet with his post-traumatic stress disorder. In February, 2015, the scumbag was sentenced to life in prison without parole.Since 'American Sniper' is about a recent American hero with, by far, the most kills of any American sniper in history (on record, that is), it's obviously pro-American and, consequently, indirectly ant-liberal. As such, the film gets raves from conservatives and utter loathing from far-left types. (Why a loony leftist would even want to see a movie like this is puzzling. Who goes to a movie they know they won't like? Which goes to show that many of the leftists who give 'American Sniper' the absolute lowest rating didn't even view it). As for me, I don't evaluate movies based upon their patriotism or political leanings; I grade them according to their quality, the most important thing being whether or not the movie is compelling. Someone can make a movie that perfectly agrees with my perspective on life, but if it's mediocre, unimaginative and boring then it's not a good movie and I'll say so.That said, I found 'American Sniper' worthwhile because it's the first movie I've seen to offer a first-hand look at what it was like to fight in Iraq. Bradley Cooper is very convincing as the humble yet resilient Kyle. So this is a solid war flick that somewhat addresses the negative effects of war and it's sure to please (particularly) conservative/patriotic types, but it lacks that special perspective or flair that marks great war films, like 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Platoon,' 'Fury,' 'The Thin Red Line,' 'Where Eagles Dare,' 'Glory,' 'Ride with the Devil,' 'All Quiet on the Western Front,' 'The Young Lions' and 'Paths of Glory.' The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Morocco and Southern California.GRADE: B",7,12,22,26 April 2015
Forrest Gump," Numersous Secrets to Success are Shown in 'Forrest Gump'
","YEAR OF RELEASE: 1994 WRITERS: Winston Groom (novel) and Eric Roth (screenplay) DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis RUNTIME: 2 hours 22 minutesI haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.'Forrest Gump' is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any credence to their judgment ('American Beauty,' best picture? Please) but 'Forrest Gump' is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exaggerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talent.-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: 'If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.'-- Mastering your talents will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).-- Keep your word.-- Pray and have FAITH.-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means 'struggles with God' (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a 'golden connection' in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: 'One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.'Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiancé at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).'Forrest Gump' is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.",9,4,6,11 March 2014
Southpaw," Modern mishmash of the Rocky films with a raw urban tone
","Released in 2015, 'Southpaw' tells the story of a champion boxer (Jake Gyllenhaal) who suffers tragedy and loses everything but his talent, drive and daughter. With the help of a trainer (Forest Whitaker) he seeks to get his crown back, plus revenge. Rachel McAdams plays his wife, Oona Laurence his daughter, 50 Cent his manager and Miguel Gomez his nemesis.The movie doesn't hide the fact that it's a modern amalgam of the Rocky movies, like II, III, V and VI. While the score is by James Horner the soundtrack is by Eminem with two impressive rap/metal songs: 'Kings Never Die' and 'Phenomenal.' Some people think this limits the film's appeal, but it also could be argued that it fits its raw urban tone. On that note, there's fluent cussing so stay away if that turns you off.Believe it or not, I've never seen Gyllenhaal in a movie before, although I recognize him, of course. He always struck me as one of those Hollywood pretty boys. I bring this up because nothing could be further from the truth with his role in 'Southpaw' where he's the furthest thing from being a 'pretty boy.' Here, he's thoroughly convincing as a street tough who thinks with his fists and understands little about finance and the business side of boxing.I was mainly interested in this movie due to McAdams, but her role is relatively small. Nevertheless, the movie pulled me into its story and entertained me for a couple of hours. Beyond that, it's a good lesson on humbling thyself and never giving up.*** MINOR SPOILERS*** Some people complain at how quickly the champion boxer loses his great wealth but, for one, it was a matter of several months, not a couple weeks. Furthermore, His accountant mentions that his funds are being burned through; he obviously had a payroll. Then it is noted that the house is mortgaged, he has zero income because he stopped fighting and his tax return was due. He then takes the HBO deal and in the first fight foolishly assaults the referee, which incurs a huge lawsuit. I would assume his purse would be withheld as a result.Also consider the fact that Mike Tyson made and lost $300 million. Yes, Mayweather and Pacquiao make gigantic money but look at other champions in other divisions. Unless you're a boxing fan you don't know the earnings of the best cruiserweight or the best bantamweight. While these guys are making good money, it's not on the Mayweather level. The movie establishes the character as rich but there's a big difference between $5 million rich and $500 million rich. Plus he wasn't tight with his money. He was buying Rolexes and cars for his buddies, not to mention legal costs; all this stuff piles up. Moreover, it's implied that the accountant and manager were taking more than their fair share.People have made and lost millions and billions in real life, so how is it so implausible for some street tough – who clearly knows next to nothing about the financial world – to lose his wealth in this movie? ***END SPOILERS*** The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in and around the general Pittsburgh, PA, region (Indiana University, Washington and McKeesport), as well as Las Vegas for the final act.GRADE: B",7,0,0,8 April 2016
Ant-Man," Ant-Man?
","Released in 2015, 'Ant-Man' stars Paul Rudd as Scott Lang, a cat burglar who is offered redemption and the opportunity to be a hero. Michael Douglas plays his mentor, Hank Pym, and Evangeline Lilly Pym's daughter; meanwhile Corey Stoll co-stars as the heavy.In my vast arsenal of old comics I have only one issue where Ant-Man is the main star: Marvel Feature #10, which featured Hank Pym as the hero, not to mention his wife, the Wasp, AKA Janet van Dyne. The character's run in that comic ceased with that very issue. By the 80s Scott Lang, a good-intentioned thief, became Ant-Man after stealing Pym's Ant-Man suit to save his daughter. With the encouragement of Pym, Lang became Ant-Man full-time.The movie is based on these events and I was surprised at how entertaining it is considering how relatively minor the hero is. The movie even makes a joke about this when Ant-Man comes face-to-face with the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Speaking of which, it's great to see the Falcon in action. It's also great to see Yellowjacket who, in the comics, was Hank Pym after Lang took over as Ant-Man. In the movie Yellowjacket is the villain (Stoll), which is okay since Pym's Yellowjacket in the comics sort of became a villain when he had a mental breakdown and was eventually divorced by Janet, the Wasp. The filmmakers incidentally did an excellent job with the Yellowjacket suit.'Ant-Man' was a surprise hit at the box office and understandably so. It's a quality superhero flick done with style and brimming with confidence. It's nothing more than this, but that's all it needs to be. It's nice to see Michael Douglas who was, believe-it-or-not, 70 years-old during shooting. He shines in the movie as Pym and could easily pass for ten years younger. I also really liked the Quantum Realm sequence when Lang is reduced to microscopic size.The film runs 117 minutes and was shot in Georgia and San Francisco, CA.

The Godfather: Part II," The ongoing story of Michael Corleone is mostly one-note drama while the story of young Vito is compelling
","RELEASED IN 1974 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, 'The Godfather: Part II' is part sequel and part flashback to the first film with the main story focusing on Michael (Al Pacino) in the late 50s as the stalwart Corleone son who has taken over as 'Godfather' with events taking place at Lake Tahoe, Miami, New York City, Havana (during the Cuban Revolution), and a congressional committee in Washington DC. The flashbacks concern Vito Corleone as a kid in Sicily and his arrival to Ellis Island with the story focusing on Vito's life in New York City when he was in his mid-to-late 20s (Robert De Niro) where he cleverly and boldly establishes himself as the formidable new Don.MAIN CAST: Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom, while John Cazale appears as the weakest Corleone son, Fredo. Diane Keaton returns as Michael's wife, who tries to put out of her mind her husband's shady business with Talia Shire reprising the role of Corleone sister, Connie.The good news is that the flashbacks pertaining to Vito (De Niro) are good, starting with the shocking opening scenes. The saga of Michael (Pacino), by contrast, is relatively dull, particularly the first half, which mostly involves overlong scenes of talky drama. Michael's story simply lacks the energy and highlight-every-15-minutes of the prior film. Moreover, Pacino is thoroughly one-note solemn as Michael, lacking the character's interesting story arc in the first installment and the dimension of the third. I'm not blaming Pacino, as he simply played the role as written and does it well. I'm just saying that he's not a very captivating character, particularly compared to Brando or De Niro as Vito. He's just too one-dimensional and therefore uninteresting. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half culminating with an explosive showdown between Michael and Kay, which had to happen in light of the climatic scene of the previous movie.The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Life's hard enough without taking that shady route.Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with some highlights, but IMHO it's not in the same league as the first movie in overall entertainment. It's good for what it is, but it's overrated by people who can't see beyond nostalgia-tinged glasses. If you're a fan of the first film it's almost mandatory that you watch this one; just don't expect the same dynamic greatness. I know it's sacrilege to say this, but Part II is on par with Part III in tone and quality, although I personally give Part III the edge in all-around entertainment value.THE FILM RUNS 3 hours & 22 minutes (overlong) and was shot in Sicily & Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy; the New York City area; Lake Tahoe, California; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; Acireale, Catania; Las Vegas; and Washington DC.

Frances McDormand plays the small town cop who investigates matters when the 'victimless crime' spirals out of control.It goes without saying that 'Fargo' has a big reputation and it's well deserved. It has influenced many films, like 'A Simple Plan' (1998), 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead' (2007) and 'Frozen River' (2008). What 'Fargo' has that none of those movies have is a sense of humor. While the events are sometimes shocking and a few of the characters represent the worst in humanity, the movie's spiced with humor and I laughed throughout.

","A mass epidemic strikes Earth which makes people go crazy and commit suicide, but only IF they are not blindfolded and SEE the mysterious phenomena. A group of Californians find succor in an abode with covered windows. One woman (Sandra Bullock) and two children try to make it down a remote river to find sanctuary, blindfolded.

The reason for the apocalypse is what makes 'Bird Box' standout and, thankfully, there are no zombies, yet it's the least of these for a couple of reasons.For one, I didn't find the dramatic dynamics of the group all that captivating, but it was okay. If you're a fan of Bullock you'll probably like this movie more than me. I appreciated Rosa Salazar as Lucy, but her role isn't that significant. Meanwhile Rhodes and Malkovich are effective.The concept behind the mass crisis is where the movie fails. It's sort of explained and yet it isn't. There are too many inconsistencies and what appears to be plot holes. It's basically a bunch of malarkey and reflects lazy writing.

"Good Morning, Vietnam"," The other side of the Vietnam War – decent but overrated
","Released in late 1987 when Vietnam films were popular, 'Good Morning, Vietnam' chronicles the real-life story of Airman Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) as a DJ in Saigon, 1965. While Cronauer is a hit with the troops he incurs the wrath of his superiors for what they consider irreverent and subversive tendencies. When he's off the air Cronauer pursues a cute Vietnamese woman (Chintara Sukapatana) while befriending her brother (Tung Thanh Tran). Forest Whitaker plays Cronauer's friend at the station while J.T. Walsh and Bruno Kirby play his nemeses.While categorized as a war comedy, 'Good Morning, Vietnam' is more of a war drama with amusing touches, simply due to Williams' antics. The film was a box office hit when it was released and hailed by critics. Roger Ebert, for instance, gave it a perfect rating. I didn't see it until a couple of nights ago – 27 years after its release – far removed from the hoopla of the period, and found it decent at best, although somewhat amusing. An example of the film's limitations can be seen when Cronauer performs in the presence of the troops in the second half; the sequence is somehow unconvincing. Nevertheless, there's an unexpected twist in the third act that piqued my interest and the movie is a necessary companion-piece to films like 1986's 'Platoon' in that it provides the non-grunt, political side of the infamous conflict.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in Thailand.GRADE: B-",6,1,2,12 May 2015
Watchmen," The 'Apocalypse Now' of superhero films
","Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, 2009's 'Watchmen' takes place in an alternative 1985 where Nixon is serving his fifth term and costumed vigilantism is illegal. A former masked crimefighter named The Comedian is murdered, prompting his previous teammates to investigate the crime. Things get complicated as the backstories of most of the Watchmen are revealed and worldwide nuclear war looms.For some reason I was never interested in the Watchmen and therefore never read the graphic novel, even though I had the opportunity. Why? The fact that it took place in an alternative reality turned me off, as did the peculiarities of the team members, which Moore intended as satire, I later discovered. That said, this is mind-blowing. 'Watchmen' is an adult-oriented superhero flick with a convoluted plot, strong characters and total originality. The latter two score high marks with me any day.Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) stands out with his gravelly voice and extreme right-wing ideology, although he's not very likable. He's impressive yet, at the same time, kind of pathetic. The character was based on Steve Ditko's The Question.The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) exudes great charisma and is reminiscent of The Punisher, if he were a jokester. Unfortunately, The Comedian's arrogant & hotheaded and has a weakness towards the ladies, not to mention cold-blooded murder.Night Owl (Patrick Wilson) is another strong character, obviously based on Batman or Blue Beetle. Unlike the previous two he's very likable. I always thought his costume looked really lame in the graphic novel but, as depicted in the film, it kicks axx.Dr. Manhattan (Greg Plitt), named for the Manhattan Project and based on Captain Atom with a dash of Mr. Fantastic, is an almost God-like being who can do pretty much anything. He's so detached from the human experience that he walks around totally nude and has no time for his woman, Silk Spectre II. He'd rather hang out on Mars -- literally! Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) stands out due to her sexy costume more than anything else, not to mention Akerman's drop-dead-gorgeous looks. The character was based on Phantom Lady and Black Canary. Silk can't handle Dr. Manhattan's increasing aloofness and consequently diverts to Night Owl for human warmth.Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) is Silk Spectre II's mother and has a pretty significant part. Like her daughter, she's hot, albeit in a whole different way.Ozzyosbourne, whoops, I mean Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is the least developed character and loosely based on Charlton Comic's Thunderbolt. He's ultra-smart, ultra-quick and kinda foppish.Another highlight is the hypnotic score by Tyler Bates mixed with a quality soundtrack (e.g. 'The Sound of Silence,' 'All Along the Watchtower,' etc.)BOTTOM LINE: The film is long, dark, mature, dialogue-driven and convoluted, but the strong characters and originality win the day. No moronic 'blockbuster' trash here. Not to mention Silk Spectre II and her mother are extremely easy on the eyes. As far as superhero flicks go, there's really nothing else like 'Watchmen.' It's even more atypical than the X-Men and easily one of my favorite superhero flicks, maybe even THE favorite. 'Watchmen' is like the 'Apocalypse Now' of superhero films!RUNTIME: Theatrical Cut: 162 minutes; Director's Cut: 186 minutes; The Ultimate Cut: 215 minutes COMPARING CUTS: I own both the theatrical cut and Director's Cut. Although the theatrical version is just fine, the DC is worthwhile for extended dialogue to existing scenes in the theatrical cut; the biggest addition is an attack on Night Owl's Mentor, Hollis Mason, at the hands of a thug gang and Night Owl's subsequent brutal revenge at a bar. Despite the convoluted plot, I had no problem following the story in the theatrical cut, even though I've never read the graphic novel. The filmmakers did an excellent job cutting out the fat in the theatrical version, so to speak. So don't think you'll need to purchase the DC to understand the story; it's not necessary. My recommendation is to check out the theatrical version first and only purchase the DC if the theatrical cut left you wanting even more, which is what it did for me. Even so, I PREFER the theatrical cut; it's leaner and just all-around better. GRADE: A",10,4,7,10 June 2012
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkien's adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws
","RELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular 'Fellowship of the Ring,' to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. The rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond). This three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it'd be sinful to give it a lower rating. There are problems, however, at least for those who aren't uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could've been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn't care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant. Fifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren't much more than glorified cameos. 'Mythica: A Quest for Heroes' (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. Despite these negatives, 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.

Man of Steel," Overkill in the second half (i.e. boring)
","The curious thing about movie action is that too much of it can be boring. Such is the case with the second half of 'Man of Steel.' The first half is a decent origin story for the hero, but the second half devolves into so much mindless action that I found myself bored despite all the 'exciting' things going on. Say what you want about 2006's 'Superman Returns,' but it didn't make this mistake. 'Superman Returns' had great character development and was engrossing, and more so as the story progressed. 'Man of Steel' is the exact opposite: The more the story progressed the more detached I became.'Man of Steel' has a lot going for it. For one, the cast is superb. Henry Cavill is the best actor to play Superman yet, and Amy Adams (Lois), Michael Shannon (General Zod), Russell Crowe (Supe's dad) and Kevin Costner (Clark's stepdad) are all fine here, not to mention Zod's female assistant, played by Antje Traue, who steals the show! Like the original 1978 'Superman' with Christopher Reeve, the sci-fi in 'Man of Steel' is stellar, only more so. Despite this, the first half's origin tale isn't as engrossing or entertaining as the first half of the '78 version. Still, it's not bad. Things go wrong in the second half, however, where one action scene is lumped on another with top-of-the-line F/X. It's similar to the Terminator films where two or more invincible inhumans pummel each other through walls and buildings, and humans shoot billions of ineffective rounds into them, except that the first three Terminator films keep your interest (especially the first two).FINAL WORD: So my feelings are mixed on 'Man of Steel.' In many ways it's great filmmaking, but they fumble the ball in the most important department -- an interesting story and characters you care about. They somewhat succeed in the first half, but the second half is an overload of 'exciting' action scenes that quickly wear out their welcome and bore the viewer.The film runs 143 minutes but seems longer.GRADE: C+",5,3,8,16 June 2013
Grease," Iconic campy musical of high school life in late '50's Southern Cal
","Released in 1978 and directed by Randal Kleiser, 'Grease' stars John Travolta as a high school greaser in 1958 Southern California, who takes interest in a new clean-cut girl from Australia (Olivia Newton-John). Stockard Channing plays the leader of the Pink Ladies with a bad rep who romances the leader of the greaser Thunderbirds (Jeff Conaway). Didi Conn and Dinah Manoff play two other notable Pink Ladies while Frankie Avalon has a song & dance cameo. This iconic musical/dramedy is campy, but kinetic and all-around entertaining. The main cast was in their physical prime. The race in the storm drain scene is a highlight, as is the school dance contest. The movie runs 110 minutes and was shot at Huntington Park High School, Burbank, Malibu, Bellflower, Venice & Los Angeles, California. The script was written by Bronté Woodard & Allan Carr from the original musical by Jim Jacobs & Warren Casey.GRADE: B",7,3,3,9 July 2017
Footloose," 'A time to mourn and a time to dance' - Ecclesiastes 3:4
","RELEASED IN 1984 and directed by Herbert Ross, 'Footloose' chronicles events in the small Western town of Bomont where dancing and loud music have been outlawed because of an accident that killed some kids years earlier. Preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) rebels against the legalistic measures while taking liking to a new student from Chicago, Ren (Kevin Bacon), whom her father (John Lithgow) disapproves of because he perceives Ren as a 'troublemaker' who wants to change the town laws against dancing.Also on hand are Chris Penn as Ren's 'country boy' pal, Willard, and Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend, Rusty. Penn's character is real fun and Sarah was a real cutie back in '84.I stayed away from this film because of Roger Ebert's scathing review and the fact that I thought the story was about some big city fop moving to a small town and dancing on the tables of the local high school, etc. I was wrong (and so was Ebert). The protagonist, Ren, is no dandy; in fact, he can kick some arse if necessary. And you never see him dancing through the halls of the high school or whatever. He's a professional-class gymnast and his dynamic solo work-out at the factory is simply a matter of blowing off steam, which is a form of healthy venting.Although I stayed away from 'Footloose,' the film acquired a respectable following and this inspired me to finally view it. I now understand why it's so popular. 'Footloose' has that cinematic magic that pulls you in and gives you a good time. This is just a really entertaining movie with an exceptional soundtrack of songs made for the move with no less than six top 40 hits, like the title track by Kenny Loggins and 'Holding Out for a Hero' performed by Bonnie Tyler, plus a couple of other significant ditties, e.g. 'Bang Your Head' by Quiet Riot.Surprisingly, 'Footloose' also has depth and is actually moving. We understand Rev. Shaw Moore's grief, but his rigid law-ism isn't doing his people or town any good. I like how Shaw isn't made out to be the clichÃ©d villain. This is a good man thinking he's doing the right thing for his town, and in many ways he is, but the legalistic spirit he cops is sapping the life out of him, his family, his congregants and his town. Does he have the wisdom to see his error and re-route?BOTTOM LINE: Footloose is easily the best of the Big Three 80's dance movies and actually made significantly more at the domestic box office than 'Dirty Dancing' ($80 million compared to $65 million). It has heart, a great cast, a superb soundtrack, all-around entertainment and real-life mindfood. It's also based on a true story that occurred in Elmore City, Oklahoma. Actually, there were similar towns with the same laws throughout America (and maybe still are). THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in areas 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City, on the eastern side of Utah Lake. WRITER: Dean Pitchford.GRADE: A",9,7,12,15 June 2013
Cast Away," One-of-a-kind type of film
","I went to see 'Cast Away' in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded-on-deserted-island movies like 'Mysterious Island' (1961), but was somewhat disappointed. Why? Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks' character in the film, Chuck Noland, is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small. As such, there's zero social interaction, except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson, and there's very little exploration of the island because it's so small. On top of this, the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous. Despite this, 'Cast Away' was a surprise hit at the box office.Viewing it a second time, I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it, but there's still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act. So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure; this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you. There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.As noted above, the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out, but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues. Some questions the film might provoke: How exactly does a certain Fed-Ex package save Chuck's life? Where's God in all of this? The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to 'Dick and Bettina', but at the end to just Bettina, what does this mean? Why the angel symbol of all things? Where does Chuck decide to go at the end? Like I said, 'Cast Away' is a one-of-a-kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it. But, when you are, it's very satisfying and even... enlightening.The film runs 143 minutes.GRADE: B-/C+",6,4,6,11 October 2013
The Thing," Stuck on a remote station in Antarctica with... The Thing
","RELEASED IN 1982 and directed by John Carter, 'The Thing' stars Kurt Russell as the helicopter pilot of an eleven-man crew at a research station in Antarctica who encounter a ghastly shape-shifting alien that perfectly replicates the appearance of its victims.This is basically a sequel to the 1956 film and even includes footage from that classic sci-fi/horror. The creature is unconventional to say the least and this adds an eerie component to an already otherworldly and confined Antarctic setting.There are no females and therefore no romantic complications. The characters are thin so the story focuses on the thing and how the crew tries to track it down and eliminate it, if they can. The nature of the gruesome entity, how it functions and how it can or cannot be killed leaves you with a lot of questions. The ending is haunting.'The Thing' may not be as great as gushing devotees insist, but it's solid sci-fi/horror with some pretty horrific scenes, although only one really creeped me out (the blood scene) while another made me bust out laughing (the torso jaws).THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 48 minutes and was shot in Alaska & British Columbia.

Armageddon," First, there was '2001: A Space Odyssey,' and then...
","...'Armageddon.'Lol, okay maybe it suffers from too much modern blockbuster syndrome, but I couldn't help thinking that 1998's 'Armageddon' was the 1990's '2001: A Space Odyssey.' I visualize the sci-fi progression something like this:1968: '2001: A Space Odyssey' 1979: 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' (which towers alone in the Trek franchise -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH) 1986: 'Aliens' 1998: 'Armageddon'Some might object that I omitted 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope' (1977), but it really doesn't fit the list. Don't get me wrong, it's good for what it is, but it's just too kid-oriented.In any event, I hated 'Armageddon' in the late 90s and never cared to see it again. My dislike was a combination of the whole 'blockbuster' syndrome with its fast-editing to please those with ADHD approach and, believe it or not, Roger Ebert's scathing denouncement, which illustrates the power of words.Well over a decade later I picked up a copy earlier this year (super-cheap) and finally viewed it a couple nights ago. Wow, was I entertained! Despite my dislike of fast-editing techniques, the story pulled me in right away and held me to the end. Yeah, some of the melodrama is too much, like Willis' scene with his daughter (Liv Tyler) near the end (rolling my eyes), but the filmmakers actually put some depth into the story and it mixes well with the action and humor. Their best move was to focus on character so that we knew and identified (with) the many individuals before the last hour's non-stop suspense and action kicked-in.Speaking of the humor, there are some laugh-out-loud lines, like the one on not paying taxes, ever.Furthermore, the star-studded cast is great and I especially appreciated the inclusion of Keith David and Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP).The film is rather long at 2 hours and 31 minutes (the DC adds two additional minutes), but the story maintains your attention and the suspense, action and F/X are literally senses-shattering.FINAL WORD: Yeah, it's a shameless, over-the-top 'blockbuster,' but it tries so hard to entertain that you can't help but respect it. Besides, in addition to the disasters, action and humor, there's some actual depth to the characters and story. Take, for instance, Willis' character stumbling upon Affleck and Tyler during an intimate moment where Affleck literally covers her with kisses while she just eats it up. Willis stops, looks, and reconsiders his stubborn position. Then you know why he does what he does at the end.GRADE: B+ or A-",8,0,3,15 December 2012
The Village," A Unique Film of Beauty and Mystery
","Released in 2004, 'The Village' is not a horror film; it's a romantic mystery. Not a 'mystery' in the sense of a murder mystery, but rather all-around mysterious. It's a 'What if...?' tale. The set-up presents the viewer with a slew of questions, which are all answered in the final act. The fun of the film is to see if you can figure out the answers before they are revealed, but that's not the only reason to appreciate it.THE PLOT: A small village in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1897 is surrounded by foreboding woods that harbor mysterious creatures. The villagers are pretty much imprisoned in the hamlet. Something happens that prompts a young blind woman to risk a journey through the dangerous woods to find medicines in another town.Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, stars as the innocent blind protagonist while Joanquin Phoenix plays her strong-and-silent loved one. Adrien Brody is effective as the detestable village idiot. Also on hand are Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt as the town elders, who know more about the situation than they let on.Director & writer M. Night Shyamalan portrays the locations with an aura of beauty and mystery. On top of this the score is fittingly haunting and beautiful. As such, the film is a feast for the eyes and ears.There's one potent scene I must mention *** minor spoiler***: Near the end, the blind girl finally encounters a person from the outer towns. The contrast of the innocent, secluded blind girl and the outsider is well captured. The outsider questions the mysterious girl but ultimately discerns that she is genuine. This is an extraordinary scene -- ranking up there with the all-time best in cinema (much like the mysterious Native American bar sequence in 'Wolfen').Although the end-revelation in Shyamalan's 'The Sixth Sense' was outstanding and arguably better than the the one in 'The Village', I personally prefer 'The Village' overall. Bottom Line: If you have a taste for surreal mystery and rustic beauty, don't miss out on 'The Village.' It's a moving, one-of-a-kind picture.GRADE: B+ or A- ***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read further if you haven't seen the film.There are two main mysteries: (1.) The nature of the creatures in the woods, and (2.) the reality of the village itself. The truth about the 'creatures' may be discerned by some viewers before it is revealed, but, I gotta admit, my wife and I didn't figure it out (and she's good at predicting story elements). As to the second mystery: There's no way a viewer could figure this enigma out as long as s/he accepts that the story takes place in 1897, which both the film and the DVD jacket indicate. The only way you could unravel this puzzle is by considering the possibility that it does not take place in 1897. My Wife and I never considered this possibility (after all, why would they lie?) and so were unable to discern the truth.Beyond all that, the film has a potent subtext. It's an allegorical slam against socialism in general and, in particular, that humanity-destroying socialist experiment known as Sweden. Its title is a riff on Hilary Clinton's socialist polemic 'It takes a village (to raise a child).' Shyamalan shows the deadly consequence of entrusting the care of our children to the socialist state. The movie opens with the village's burial of a young child and begins the final act with the death of a product of village upbringing: a dim-witted, craven murderer.The movie focuses on the sad fate of the young adults who manage to survive their socialist upraising while retaining a remnant of hope for a better future. The pure-hearted and intelligent Ivy is ultimately seduced by power and welcomed into the inner-circle of village leaders where she will promote the utopian lie of peace within the community and chaos outside, meanwhile continuing to bury the young and execute the useless. Her love interest, the obedient Lucius, is unfit for the inner circle but will be useful as a goon-enforcer for the village as he carries on the Elders' practice of terrorizing its own citizenry in the guise of forest monsters.As with Sweden, the village is dependant on Western capital. Its appearance of self-sufficiency is a facade. It was built with, survives on and is protected by the wealth of capitalists. This can't last forever, of course. As Margaret Thatcher put it, the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.",7,1,3,6 April 2013
The Revenant," Hugh Glass has a bad day
","Released in late 2015, 'The Revenant' stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Hugh Glass, a man who in real life survives a mauling by a grizzly bear and makes his way crawling and stumbling 200 miles to Fort Kiowa, in South Dakota, after being abandoned without supplies or weapons by fellow explorers and fur traders during General Ashley's expedition of 1823. Vengeful, Glass then sets out to confront his trapping partners who left him to die. The movie's loosely based on these events, but the locations are far removed from the Missouri River area of South Dakota, which makes for a more scenic experience in light of the locations being spectacular. The story was first made into a movie as 1971's 'Man in the Wilderness' starring Richard Harris and John Huston. Whereas that movie has the better story 'The Revenant' has the better filmmaking. It's not just that it's a more expensive production with outstanding location shooting and quality actors, but also the modern filmmaking technique is superlative. If you like wilderness survival/adventure movies then 'The Revenant' is a must. While the film runs over two and a half hours it kept my attention throughout and didn't seem that long. It's thoroughly realistic except that it's marred by Road Runner-like sequences (you'll know what I mean). The film runs 156 minutes and was shot in Alberta, British Columbia, Montana, Arizona, Mexico and Argentina.GRADE: B",7,0,1,8 May 2016
Cold Mountain," Civil War Odyssey
","A Confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) deserts in late 1864 to return to the mountains of western North Carolina and his one true love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Inman experiences many different people, events and obstacles on his long journey while Ada has her own problems to deal with: death, grief, the ruthless 'home guard,' starvation/poverty, and a house & farm she doesn't know how to run, that is, until the practical Ruby (Renée Zellweger) comes along.Based on the 1997 novel by Charles Frazier, 'Cold Mountain' (2003) involves two stories that ultimately intertwine and is reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey. In light of Inman's journey home, the film is episodic but, thankfully, never loses its sense of cohesion. The story shows how the war destroyed or corrupted the South on practically every level, not just the soldiers who went off to fight, die, be maimed, desert or suffer defeat, but everyone left behind as well. Every person Inman meets on his journey is somehow damaged or sullied because of the war.For example, in the case of the family in the large cabin the husband's friendliness is dubious. All the eligible men have gone to war and those who return are maimed and scarred. Is it any wonder that the women are love-starved and try to lose themselves in drunkenness and casual sex? As for a couple scenes of overt sexuality, the book & film are contrasting drunken carnal lust with intimate committed love.These scenes are adult-oriented, so be forewarned. I should add that the 'kitchen table woman' is actress Melora Walters, who played George Costanza's date in 'The Hamptons' episode of Seinfeld. Meanwhile Natalie Portman shows up for another key sequence.Then there's the immoral & looney 'Reverend' Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who may tempt some to view the film as 'anti-Christian,' but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending. Not to mention likable, but shakey religionists like Veasey exist in real life.Not everyone can handle 'Cold Mountain' because of its hardcore depiction of the horrors of war, madness and immorality, but it's not all death, misery and darkness; these are commendably counterbalanced by the beauty of life, love, loyalty, companionship, poetry and music. 'Cold Mountain' is an all-around well-made motion picture that cuts the fat out of the book for a more effective story.The film runs 2 hours, 33 minutes, and was shot mostly in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania, but with some scenes done in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.GRADE: A",9,1,1,12 January 2011
American Psycho," The opposite of 'Deathwish'
","'American Psycho' (2000) didn't look like a promising film for me. On the surface, the plot is essentially the reverse of 'Deathwish.' In 'Deathwish' a respectable citizen in New York City forsakes the law to secretly kill criminal scumbags in the name of justice; in 'American Psycho' a scumbag in New York City masquerades as a respectable citizen while secretly murdering innocent people.I didn't think I'd like this film because the main character is, well, an American psycho (Christian Bale), which means it's impossible to care about him or root for him. In fact, pretty much the only people in the film that you might care about or root for are the psycho's secretary, Jean, and the detective (Willem Dafoe).So the film starts off with a strike against it, but then I found myself getting into the story, meaning I was entertained, and that's the name of the game in cinema.I also got the joke. 'American Psycho' is not a serious horror movie or drama; it's a black comedy or satire. As such, it's impossible to take seriously and be scared; and there are quite a few amusing or laugh-out-loud scenes (like the head in the fridge).Thankfully, 'American Psycho' has meaning beyond the surface. It's a commentary on the emptiness of America's materialistic, irreligious modern culture. Our innate moral compass has been lost with the passing of spiritual faith as we desperately search for meaning in secularism, materialism, pompous titles and the outward images of success, which generally leaves us looking good, but spiritually bereft. Life becomes virtually meaningless beyond the mechanics of the grind and everything that goes into it. People become mere objects to compete with or fulfill selfish desires. Etcetera. ***SPOILER ALERT*** And then the final act strongly hints that none of the murders are real; it's all in his mind and he's going deeper into insanity.***END SPOILER***I don't know if it's because of Bale's subsequent fame as the Batman or what, but 'American Psycho' has become a popular cult film since its poor performance at the box office in 2000.This is a hard R-rated film, so stay away if you're not in the mood for heaps of violence, gore, nudity, sex and cussing.The runs 102 minutes and was shot in Toronto and New York City.GRADE: B- or C+",6,0,0,7 October 2012
North by Northwest," It has its points of interest, but any 60's Bond flick is a better choice
","When an ad executive in Manhattan (Gary Cooper) is mistaken for a government agent by a foreign spy & his cronies (James Mason, et al.) he finds himself a fugitive traveling by train to Chicago wherein he meets a woman that seems to have his favor (Eva Marie Saint). After a curious encounter with a crop dusting plane everything culminates at Mount Rushmore, South Dakota.'North by Northwest' (1959) is an adventure/thriller by Hitchcock with a huge reputation. It obviously influenced the James Bond flicks of the 60s, which started three years later with 'Dr. No' (1962), but it's very toned down by comparison because the hero in this case is not a trained spy. It's entertaining to a point, but also seriously overrated due to some glaring problems...Jessie Royce Landis plays the protagonist's mother when she was only a little over 7 years older than Cooper and it's too obvious; the story drags too much at this point (when he's hanging out with his mother); his chance meeting with a key character on the train (Saint) is too coincidental; their make-out sessions are premature, unconvincing and painfully dull; what happens to the plane is stupefying; the crop dusting encounter supposedly takes place in rural Indiana when it's clear that it's nowhere within a thousand miles of Indiana (actually it was shot at the southern end of Central Valley, California, outside of Bakersfield); speaking of which, the geography is too noticeably disingenuous: e.g. during the drunk driving episode there are no cliffs like that on Long Island (it was actually shot at Potrero Valley, Thousand Oaks, CA, and obviously so).Still, there's enough good here to enjoy if you favor Hitchcock & the cast and don't mind quaint movies.The film runs 2 hours, 15 minutes (unnecessarily overlong).GRADE: B-/C+",6,1,2,26 December 2019

Doctor Zhivago," Russian political upheaval of the early 20th century through the eyes of a passive doctor/poet
","Released in 1965 and directed by David Lean from Boris Pasternak's novel, 'Doctor Zhivago' is a historical drama/adventure focusing on the eponymous Russian physician/poet (Omar Sharif) who, although married to Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin), falls in love with Lara (Julie Christie), the wife of an austere political activist (Tom Courtenay). They experience the hardships of the First World War and then the ensuing Russian Revolution. Rod Steiger plays the semi-villainous Komarovsky while Alec Guinness plays Zhivago's half-brother. Klaus Kinski has a small, but memorable, role during the train sequence. 'Doctor Zhivago' was a massive event in the mid-60s and it stands the test of time. To appreciate it you have to favor David Lean's style, which is epic and artistic, but also mundane and realistic (and, sometimes surrealistic, like the sabre-wielding Cossack attack on the peaceful protesters in Moscow). Perhaps the best part of this movie is its great Winter ambiance. Its weakest part is the leisurely and nigh-impenetrable first hour in Moscow, but once Zhivago & family flee to the Urals it's mesmerizing to the finish.While Zhivago is a likable, peaceable protagonist his ultimate unfaithfulness to Tonya is ignoble and duplicitous, but the story reflects reality. It's not like husbands having mistresses on the side is rare, and even more so if you include thought life. The movie runs 200 minutes and was shot in Finland, Spain and Alberta, CanadaGRADE: A-***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie)I've heard the movie criticized on the grounds that there are no scenes at the field hospital showing Zhivago and Lara falling in love. Response: From the standpoint of the married Zhivago it was love-at-first-sight (or, better described, totally-intrigued-at-first-sight) when he first sees Lara at the apartment wherein her mother tried to commit suicide. Yuri has the same 'Whoa Mama' response when he subsequently sees her shoot Komarovsky at the party. Even their initial non-meeting in the streetcar where they merely brush shoulders the camera immediately cuts to a shot of the roof of the trolley where there are literal sparks flying from the electric line (!). When they finally meet-up at the field hospital several years later Zhivago falls in love with Lara during the six months working together and 'fesses-up at the end. It's clear that Lara pretty much feels the same way, but she nobly encourages him not to do anything that would make it necessary to lie to his wife, Tonya. This shows that there were no hot romantic scenes up to this point in the story. Nada. The two were simply working together in a mundane war situation where they developed unspoken feelings for each other over the course of the six months. This was all the prelude to the third act where they happen upon each other at the town in the Urals and proceed to have a steamy affair. As far as I'm concerned, there's enough romantic drama in the third act. Their encounters before that were just preparatory stepping stones to their forthcoming intimate relationship.",8,1,2,30 October 2016
American Beauty," Morally Confused Garbage
","This film is hard to believe. Although it is well-made and generally sustains interest, it's message is poisonous.The main protagonist is a teenage drug peddler. He sees artistic beauty in things like a corpse with its brains blown out.A neighborhood gay couple is portrayed as blissful and well-adjusted; by comparison the two heterosexual couples are miserable and dysfunctional. One heterosexual father quits his job during his midlife crisis and starts an affair with a high school cheerleader (!); the other hetero father is a sadistic control-freak. One heterosexual mother is a materialistic adulterous, the other a zombie. Their kids are lost.It is revealed that the reason the one father is such an abusive hate-monger is because he denied his homosexual tendencies all his life.The overall message of the film rings loud and clear: Embrace homosexuality and you'll be happy, have a normal family and you'll be miserable.If you're a homosexual and want encouragement for your chosen lifestyle then pick up this flick. All others should avoid like the plague.GRADE: F",1,5,10,12 March 2014
The Alamo," The Awful Truth: A small group of brave men waiting to be massacred by a veritable army
","Released in 2004 and directed by John Lee Hancock, 'The Alamo' is a Western about the 1836 siege and fall of the famous Spanish mission-turned-fortress by Santa Anna's army of a couple thousand disciplined troops. The Alamo is defended by a ragtag assortment of roughly 200 soldiers, militia men and volunteers, including the famous frontiersman & politician Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), loose cannon Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) and by-the-book militarist Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson), the latter two regularly butting heads. Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) is on hand as a significant peripheral character. The more popular John Wayne version from 1960 is just all-around more entertaining than this generally dreary rendition, although this version certainly earns points for being more realistic plus giving Santa Anna considerable screen time (excellently played by Emilio Echevarría), the latter of which the Wayne version doesn't do at all. Not to mention, this version ends with the humiliating defeat of Santa Anna & his army in a mere 18 minutes just six weeks after the fall of the Alamo. The rallying cry of Sam Houston & the Texian Army was naturally 'Remember the Alamo!' You could say that Wayne filmed the Spirit of the Alamo with everything that goes with it, like big historical speeches, while the newer film goes for a more realistic telling, including de-mythifying the various legends. When it comes to historical accuracy, this version is about as close as any Hollywood movie gets. But keep this in mind: No movie has ever been made, or will ever be made, about the Alamo that's thoroughly accurate, except for the obvious gist of things. Why? Because ALL of the defenders were killed. Even the Mexican eyewitnesses who were there disagreed on the major events that took place. For example, there are those who claim Davy Crockett was killed in the assault, as shown in Wayne's version, while others say he survived the battle along with 5-6 others only to be captured, lined up, and executed, as essentially depicted in this film. So any movie you see about the Alamo is going to contain a lot of conjecture.Dimitri Tiomkin's score in Wayne's version is a dramatic, thrilling and tragic multifaceted piece that captured the slow build-up, eventual battle and aftermath. Carter Burwell's score in this version is mediocre by comparison; while certainly adept and adequate, it's essentially a funeral dirge that puts a dreary overcast over the proceedings. BOTTOM LINE: I've seen this version of 'The Alamo' twice and have mixed feeling about it. I prefer the more modern, realistic tone of this version to Wayne's rendition, as well as the time devoted to Santa Anna & his men, not to mention the inclusion of the Battle of San Jacinto. On top of this, the movie's spiced with numerous good-to-great bits, but – overall – it just comes across too flat and dull. Something needed to perk it up out of the cinematic doldrums. The depiction of the Battle of San Jacinto does this, of course, but it's the last 12 minutes of the film and too little too late. Perhaps too many cooks spoiled the broth. The movie runs 134 minutes and was shot in near Wimberly, Texas, forty miles north of San Antonio GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)",5,0,0,18 August 2016
Heartbreak Ridge," A more comedic version of 'The Dirty Dozen,' but taking place in 1983 and starring Clint Eastwood
","Clint Eastwood's 'Heartbreak Ridge' (1986) stars Eastwood as a tough, soon-to-retire Marine gunnery sergeant who conflicts with the brass and his former-wife (Marsha Mason) as he takes command of a spoiled recon squad. The platoon is eventually deployed to Grenada in late October, 1983, in order to prevent a communist takeover and rescue some med students.Thirteen years after 'The Dirty Dozen,' Eastwood recycles the plot and adds a lot of hip comedy. Although it's not a great military flick like 'Dozen' it has its points of entertainment, but you have to roll with the odd mixture of believable military training drama with heavy doses of amusement, mainly revolving around the cartoonish character of Cpl. Stitch Jones, played with fervor by Mario Van Peebles. If you can acclimate to this odd mixture, there's a lot to enjoy here.It helps that the movie hooks you in with the opening jail fight involving the hard-living Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood). His reunion with his ex-wife and their potentially developing relationship is another hook. Some parts are kinda meh, but there's enough good here if you're in the mood for a military training flick in the form of 'The Dirty Dozen' meeting 'Top Gun' (1987) mixed with an edgier version of Gomer Pyle.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes and was shot at Camp Pendleton, Southern Cal, as well as Santa Clarita (café), San Clemente (bar), El Toro (airfield homecoming) and Vieques, Puerto Rico (Grenada).GRADE: B-",6,1,2,18 December 2018
Apocalypse Now," The greatest film ever made, but not 'Redux'
","The original 'Apocalypse Now' is an awe-inspiring masterpiece and is my all-time favorite film. Memorable scenes abound, starting with the mind-blowing opening with Willard (Martin Sheen) having a mental breakdown in his sweltering Saigon hotel room to the tune of The Doors' 'The End.'Speaking of Sheen, people overlook the fact that he expertly carries the film. His haunting narration is one of the most effective narrations in cinematic history and hooks the viewer into the nightmare-adventure.I could go on and on about the noteworthy scenes, but I'll resist, except to comment on Col. Kurtz: Was he really insane or actually an unrecognized genius? General Corman informs Willard: 'He's out there operating without any decent restraint, totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct. And he is still in the field commanding troops.' And, yet, Kurtz was accomplishing what the US military couldn't or wouldn't do because of political complications and niceties. I bring this up because, as I've aged, I've come to see that I'M Col. Kurtz in some ways -- operating 'out there' beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.The script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with 'K,' which is no accident:COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. glorifies it. The fact that he's a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he 'loves the smell of napalm in the morning.' War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there's no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he's part of the system and plays the game of war.COL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It's horror itself and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can't have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth.The 'Redux' version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 53 minutes of material that he originally cut. Very little of the added footage improves the film. Most of it simply drags it down; the rest is either boring and unnecessary or adds a dimension of silliness, not to mention being dubiously scripted and acted.The first let down of 'Redux' is revealed when Captain Willard hooks up with the boat & crew who are to escort him up the river to find Colonel Kurtz. In the original there's a water-skiing scene on the river which dynamically introduces us to the absurdities of every-day life in the field in Nam (with the Rolling Stone's 'Satisfaction' blaring). In 'Redux' this part is cut-and-pasted to an hour LATER in the film, horribly muting the original's introduction to life-in-the-field. (I realize WHY Coppola did this -- because the scene was originally intended to be shown AFTER the boat crew steal Kilgore's surfboard -- but he made the right decision to omit the board-theft scene and place the water-skiing scene near the beginning).The introduction of Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) in 'Redux' is good. The charisma of this air cavalry colonel in all his swaggering glory is perfectly showcased in this brief snippet; but the scene's so brief it's unessential.Four main new sequences definitely DON'T work: The scenes involving the theft of Kilgore's surfboard are silly, badly scripted and unnecessary. In fact, they ruin Kilgore's perfect swan song in the original. Moreover these scenes reveal a goofy side to Willard that mar his grim mystique in the original.The additional bunny sequence during the rain storm is also silly and unnecessary; it's a huge letdown even if your sole desire is to see some more skin.The longest added sequence involves the French plantation mentioned in the 1991 documentary 'Hearts of Darkness - A Filmmaker's Apocalypse.' Small bits of this piece work and enrich the film (like the ghostly discovery of the plantation), but on a whole it's too long & talky (where it's impossible to understand the heavily-accented dialogue without subtitles) and simply bogs the film down.The final added scene that is unnecessary and arguably reduces the potency of the original film is the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of underwhelming Time magazine articles to the caged Willard. While it could be argued that this sequence destroys the great mystique of Kurtz since it's the FIRST and ONLY time we get to see him CLEARLY in broad daylight, it could also be argued that it's the key scene showing that Kurtz ISN'T insane at all, just trapped in the remote jungle with no place to go because he 'got off the boat.'So Coppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film. The new footage of 'Redux' should've simply been relegated to the 'deleted scenes' section of the DVD. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and 'Redux' proves it.GRADE: Original version: A+ , Redux: C+",10,6,10,14 March 2014
The Patriot," The Carolina theater of the Revolutionary War brought to life
","Released in 2000 and directed by Roland Emmerich, 'The Patriot' is stars Mel Gibson as peaceful South Carolina farmer Benjamin Martin who is driven to lead the Colonial Militia during the American Revolution after a wicked British colonel (Jason Isaacs) murders his son. The late Heath Ledger plays the older son with cutie Lisa Brenner playing his wannabe girlfriend. Rene Auberjonois is on hand as a pastor-soldier for the Militia while TchÃ©ky Karyo appears as a French officer on the side of the Americans. Joely Richardson plays the sister of Martin's late wife, and potential love-interest.The basic plot was taken from 1965's 'Shenandoah,' but there's more than enough difference for 'The Patriot' to stand on its own. As my title blurb points out, the movie successfully brings the Revolutionary War to life, focusing on the Carolina campaign. Speaking of which, the South Carolina locations are excellent, particularly the Old Spanish Mission swamp encampment, shot at Cypress Gardens, Moncks Corner. The only part shot outside South Carolina was the British Headquarters, filmed at Stratford Hall Plantation, Virginia.I'm not a big Gibson fan and there are too many Hollywoodisms for my tastes but, other than that, 'The Patriot' is an entertaining way to acquaint yourself with the Revolutionary War.

Van Helsing," Big Dumb Blockbuster Monster Fun
","Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's 'The Mummy,' he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel 'The Mummy Returns,' a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and 'exciting' things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's 'Van Helsing,' although not as bad.THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies, etc.It won't take long for the viewer to perceive that 'Van Helsing' shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic Universal monster movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' (1992) with the over-the-top thrills of Indiana Jones and the flair of classic monster parodies like 'The Vampire Happening' (1971) or 'Young Frankenstein' (1974) and you'd have a good approximation.The film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves. Others look quite good, like the flying vampire brides and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with 'The Mummy Returns' the film is strangely tedious despite all the manic happenings. Thankfully, there are worthy hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna. I wish there was more.Speaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (speaking as someone who's not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran and Elena Anaya are also striking as two of Dracula's wives, Marishka and Aleera. Needless to say, excellent job on the female front. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role. Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), David Wenham (Carl), Kevin J. O'Connor (Igor) and Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein's monster) are all entertaining or effective.At the end of the day, though, 'Van Helsing' barely rises above the limitations of what it is: a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Considering the $160 million thrown into it, it shoulda/coulda been better. The story needed time to breathe and less constant mania. The movie's also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes. Still, it's better than 'The Mummy Returns' and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Czech Republic, Rome and Paris with studio work done in Southern Cal and Orlando, Florida.GRADE: B-/C+",6,3,5,26 November 2012
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Kick axx continuation of the sylvan fairy tale about slaying diabolical witches
","In Medieval Germany, Hansel & Gretel (Jeremy Renner & Gemma Arterton) are now adults and formidable witch slayers, not to mention considered heroes in the community. When numerous children turn-up missing, they trace the problem to an unholy celebration orchestrated by a grand witch (Famke Janssen). Fetching Pihla Viitala plays a redhead villager accused of witchcraft.'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' (2013) is a dark fantasy/action/comedy/horror that takes the German fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm and envisions events about twenty years later. Imagine the excellent 'Season of the Witch' (2011) meshed with the fantasy elements of the fable and you'd have a good idea of this movie. 'Dracula Untold' (2014) and 'Snow White and the Huntsman' (2012) are good contemporary associations, but 'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' is noticeably superior.This movie just kicks total axx from beginning to end with Gemma jaw-dropping as the take-no-sheet heroine and Renner rising to the challenge. The witches are ee-vil and worthy of nothing other than immediate slaughter, which is basically the siblings' modus operandi. There's a lot of thrilling action and gore, some of it so over-the-top it's amusing; there's even a terrible troll. And the movie LOOKs great.

Kirsten Dunst plays his wannabe girlfriend, Mary Jane, while James Franco plays his best friend and rival, Harry Osborn. Willem Dafoe is on hand as the schizophrenic Norman Osborn, who's also the Green Goblin. Cliff Robertson & Rosemary Harris play Peter's Uncle & Aunt while J.K. Simmons appears as newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson.Although it was 2000's 'X-Men' that ushered in the modern superhero film, it was 'Spider-Man' that drove it home. The movie remains an exhilarating example of the genre and is markedly superior to the merely competent reboot 'The Amazing Spider-Man,' which came out just 10 years later. Compare the costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest.There are some flaws: The second half isn't as compelling as the first and the apartment fire sequence is eye-rolling in that there's zero smoke in the abode. Then there are changes from the comics, some which work great (e.g. scrapping Spidey's web-shooters in favor of intrinsic web-powers) and some which are just acceptable (e.g. MJ's noticeably different disposition). But such quibbles are made up for by the movie's overall mojo. Simmons nails it as the quirky & kinetic Jameson.'Spider-Man' remains the second best Spider-Man film, second only to 'Spider-Man 3' (2007), not including 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' (2017), which I haven't seen yet.The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in New York City & Los Angeles, as well as a few other areas in New York and Southern Cal, e.g. the cemetery scene in Valhalla, NY.

There's a dead prostitute nearby that he gets blamed for murdering, but he can't remember much of anything. Several people seek him in the ensuing night hours: a somewhat mad doctor played by Kiefer Sutherland, a detective played by William Hurt, his estranged wife played by Jennifer Connelly, a hot woman of the night played by Melissa George and a bizarre group of pale bald males in black trench coats. The story follows Murdoch as he tries to piece together reality and escape the perpetually dark city.You have to be in the mood for a movie like this because it takes place entirely on elaborate shadowy sets with CGI backgrounds, etc. The first time I tried to watch it I gave up after 20 minutes. But, if you're in the right mode, this is a cool sci-fi flick with elements of horror/mystery and film noir. It never devolves into predictable blockbuster dreck and is thought-provoking. The revelation of the nature of the city is well done. In addition, Sewell makes for a top-rate protagonist and William Hurt is always likable. Many complain about Kiefer's offbeat performance, but the role called for it. If you don't like it blame the writers.On the female front you have Jennifer Connelly when she was still curvy and ravishing (by the early 2000s she lost too much weight and lost her sexiness). Melissa George is gorgeous in her small role as a bad girl.My interest in 'Dark City' was spurred by Roger Ebert's exuberant accolades. He was so impressed by the illusion of the vast scope of the city, which can be attributed to the well-done CGI backgrounds and accouterments beyond the immediate exemplary sets. Of course, this is no big deal today, but at the time it was still fairly new technology.Some people compare 'Dark City' to the more popular 'The Matrix' and for good reason since they have similar themes and 'The Matrix' was actually shot on some of the same sets, but it came out over a year later in 1999.The film runs 100 minutes and the Director's Cut 111 minutes; it was shot on sets in Sydney, Australia.GRADE: B+",7,2,3,29 April 2015

Aliens," One of the best monster movies
","I prefer James Cameron's 'Aliens' (1986) to its predecessor, Ridley Scott's 'Alien' (1979), mainly because the story is more compelling. People often say 'Aliens' is more of an action film than 'Alien,' but it's not a mindless action film and, in fact, the action doesn't even start until a FULL HOUR into its 2 hour and 18 minutes runtime (the extended cut runs about 16 minutes longer). The best horror/action movies take this route -- taking their time to build character and suspense before unleashing the horrific mayhem.Some complain about the screaming little girl, Newt, but -- hey -- she's a little girl and I think the situation calls for this sort of response. Others complain that Bill Paxton is too whiny as one of the Marines, but isn't this the way SOME people respond when facing overwhelming defeat -- even hardened militarists -- particularly by hideous extraterrestrial monsters? Another complaint is that the Marines are depicted as dumb, arrogant 'oo-rah' types, but I used to be a Marine and this was the way the over-the-top ones acted and, furthermore, these are the kinds of Marines that would qualify for such a dangerous mission -- the (over)confident wackjobs who would get the job done and done right.The initial confrontation with the aliens at the hour mark is one of the most horrific sequences in cinematic history; and the Marines are thoroughly humbled. The rest of the film shows the surviving group literally sweating-it-out trying to figure out how to get off the planet alive where annihilating the creatures becomes a secondary objective.Ripley's motherly love for Newt is a good addition and it humanizes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The sequences with the alien Queen make for a dynamic and extended climax. Also, Lance Henriksen is notable as the 'artificial human' and Paul Reiser as an effective love-to-hate quasi-villain.On the downside, the film is noticeably setbound, but that's par for the course for these types of sci-fi films, e.g. Star Trek. Another negative -- for me at least -- is that the film features no curvy babes, but this was the case with the first film as well, so it's to be expected. Besides, I think the female crew is more believable without someone like Juno Temple or Megan Fox aboard, lol.The bottom line is that 'Aliens' is easily one of the greatest monster films of all time, surpassing even the first film in the series and leagues better than the next two.GRADE: A",9,1,2,16 June 2014

Michelle Rodriguez is on hand as Dom's babe while Matt Schulze plays an angry member of his gang.'The Fast and the Furious' (2001) was the beginning of the popular street-racing franchise that currently has eight movies with two more planned. The over-the-top action is akin to 'The Road Warrior' (1981) while the tone mixes the comic book melodrama of 'The Warriors' (1979) and 'Torque' (2004) with the more serious air of 'Grand Canyon' (1991) and 'Training Day' (2001). (Yes, I realize 'Torque' and 'Training Day' debuted after this one; I'm just providing comparative references).Speaking of the tone, there's no goofiness and the actors take everything dead seriously, which is good in my book, but the flick has several unintentional laughs because, while quasi-realistic, the thrills & posing are so exaggerated.Brewster and Rodriguez are effective in the feminine department, but neither do much for me personally. There are a few good-looking ladies in the periphery, however.The soundtrack contains several dynamic urban numbers, including the excellent 'Deep Enough' by Live.The movie runs 1 hour, 46 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & nearby areas (San Bernardino, Hemet, Malibu, Westminster, Beverly Hills, etc.).GRADE: B",7,2,2,8 May 2019
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Focuses on the best characters and an interesting story
","'X-Men: Days of Future Past' (2014) starts in an apocalyptic near-future where mutants are being wiped out by Sentinels, government-made robots created for this very purpose. The X-Men and Magneto decide to send Wolverine's consciousness back to his body in 1973 to prevent the Sentinels from attaining their mutant-killing powers.This is easily one of the best X-Men films because of the interesting plot and the focus on the most interesting characters. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) has been the top X-Men since day one so you can't go wrong with making him the focal point. James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart are excellent as Professor X, as are Michael Fassbender as young Magneto, Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique and Evan Peters as Quicksilver, the latter in a small but highly entertaining role. Nicholas Hoult as Beast gets an honorable mention and Bingbing Fan is notable as Blink, particularly her stunning face.The plot is convoluted and yet easy to follow if you're familiar with the franchise's story arc. The film is all-around compelling. It has the confidence to slow down and be pensive while throwing in the requisite thrills and not forgetting to be entertaining. For instance, the creative and amusing way Quicksilver takes down a bunch of security guards at the Pentagon, which is one of the movie's top scenes. Lastly, I like the way Magneto's great power is illustrated (you'll see what I mean).The film runs 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot in Québec, Canada.GRADE: A",9,1,4,5 October 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Captain America and the Falcon and The Avengers
","Released in 2016, 'Captain America: Civil War' chronicles Cap (Chris Evans) leading an Avengers mission that results in the loss of many innocents. As a result, the Federal government and UN, represented by Everett K. Ross (Martin Freeman), want to take the reins of The Avengers. While Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a few others reluctantly support this measure, Cap, Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and some others categorically oppose it, which naturally pits the team against one another. Meanwhile, villains like Zemo (Daniel Brühl), Crossbones (Frank Grillo) are on the loose, creating further problems.I'm a big fan of Steve Englehart's outstanding run on the comic in the '70s, which was the precursor to Mark Gruenwald's notable work 10-20 years later (his run lasted a whole decade!). What I loved about the comic was the relatively realistic tone, the interesting relevant issues and the fact that Cap & Falcon were the perfect representation of the USA. You'll see these elements in 'Captain America: Civil War.' The occasional interludes with Cap's babe, Sharon Carter (Emily VanCamp), are reminiscent of the comic. Speaking of The Falcon, I like the way the writers took the basic concept and made him better; for instance, the way his wings deflect bullets and the nature of his 'pet falcon' Redwing.Since the plot ties into Cap's leadership in The Avengers we get numerous guest stars in addition to the ones already mentioned: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), The Vision (Paul Bettany), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and War Machine (Don Cheadle). As if that wasn't enough we also get Ant-Man (Paul Rudd), The Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and, believe it or not, freakin' Spider-Man (Tom Holland), with a glorified cameo of a hot Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), lol. How the movie can juggle all these characters and keep it from getting out of hand is uncanny.Lastly the core question of the titular 'civil war' is interesting and timely: Should the government usurp control over The Avenger's autonomy? Should this incredible team of superhumans become the pawns of the government? Captain America rightly says 'No way.' The movie runs 147 minutes and was shot in Puerto Rico, Atlanta, Germany, Iceland and Brazil.GRADE: A (8.5/10)",9,13,28,5 July 2016
American History X," Brutal, visceral drama on hateful tribalism and escape
","Released in late 1998 and directed by Tony Kaye from David McKenna's script, 'American History X' is an urban drama about a former neo-Nazi leader, Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), who tries to prevent his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), from taking the same path of hate he did. Current events are shown in color whereas flashbacks are depicted in B&W. Stacy Keach plays the behind-the-scenes mentor of the neo-Nazis while Avery Brooks appears as Danny's principal. Elliott Gould is on hand as a Jewish history teacher who is interested in Danny's mother (Beverly D'Angelo).During the first half I found some of the dramatics dubious, to be nice; you can tell that kinks needed worked out in the script or the acting. After viewing the movie, I found out that the director felt the same way, insisting that the film needed more work; he also objected to Norton re-editing scenes without his approval and even wanted his name removed from the credits.If you can roll with the palpable flaws, however, you'll likely find yourself immersed in the world of the characters by the second half. While the topic is unpleasant and there are some hard scenes to watch, 'American History X' shoots for greatness and in some ways grasps it. For instance, there are a few moving, artistically-staged sequences, like the aftermath of the dinner-scene-from-hell and the climax. This is what I look for in great dramas, but rarely get. Norton's powerful performance is another example of the film's greatness.Someone criticized the movie on the grounds that it simplifies complex issues, but how else can you tackle a subject like this and do it justice in a 2-hour movie while keeping it entertaining? Besides, nothing was so simplified to be unbelievable, as far as Derek's character arc goes. Someone else panned the narration, but – aduh – I guess he didn't get that the words are Danny's essay assignment for his new 'class' with the principal, which explain the movie's title.The overriding theme is that that all races/ethnicities tend to stick together and are in an undeclared war. The skinheads aren't really singled out because the movie plainly shows that their hostilities are mirrored in the other gangs, albeit with different verbiage and accouterments. While antagonistic tribalism is rampant it can't stand in the face of genuine relationship and the corresponding love and respect.ADDITIONAL CAST: Fairuza Balk plays Derek's girlfriend while Jennifer Lien and William Russ appear as his sister and father. Guy Torry is on hand as an inmate Derek slowly befriends while Ethan Suplee plays a hulking neo-Nazi.The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles (Venice, Venice Beach, Fairfax, North Hollywood).GRADE: A-",8,1,2,22 February 2017
Pearl Harbor," A fine drama/romance combined with great war action
","'Pearl Harbor' (2001) is a Titanic-ized version of the tragic events of Pearl Harbor -- a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of December 7, 1941. It's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the dramatic-romantic part of the story BETTER be good, and it is -- and it's believable too (except for the premature sex part, which inaccurately transfers modern sex morals to the early '40s). This first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. I didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but I was wrong, as we see some quality action when Rafe (Ben Affleck) goes over to Europe to fly for the British. Believing him to be dead, his girlfriend (Kate Backinsale) and best friend (Josh Hartnett) spend a lot of time together and naturally develop a relationship; but ***SPOILER ALERT*** Rafe miraculously survives, which leads to some more action ***END SPOILER***.Many criticize the acting and dialogue of the drama, but I found nothing wrong with it. In fact, I found it quite well done and realistic. For instance, the film shows that Danny (Hartnett) was abused by his father while growing up. Later while dancing & drinking Evelyn (Beckinsale) comments to Rafe how shy Danny seems to be while Danny is shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. Rafe responds that Danny is like a brother to him, that Danny's father abused him and he therefore lacks confidence. This is REAL, my friends. Much later, after it is believed that Rafe is dead, Danny goes to Evelyn's apartment fumbling & stumbling to ask her out. The conversation is, of course, awkward. He then walks away, speaking under his breath, 'You're such an idiot!' This is good, realistic stuff.The film also shows that the timid average-looking man (Danny) can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man (Rafe). It's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.As for the Pearl Harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. Critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? -- Go ahead and state them. Seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? I'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe Jimmy Doolittle's boot laces weren't right -- Oh my God!!), but what film ever has everything 100% right? They for certain got the gist of the event right, what more do you want? Get a life.You want accuracy? The subplot with Cuba Gooding Jr. as the winning Navy boxer Doris Miller is a true story. Research it, it's a fascinating story.The film is also respectful of the Japanese' viewpoint as they plan, prepare for and carry out their attack. I felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. They spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression.There's also a great scene showing the Japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. It's very realistic.After the attack I knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so I was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details The Doolittle Raid, the first American bombing mission over Japan. More great war action.I never even knew about this bold bombing mission until I saw this movie. It took place a mere 4.5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack on April, 1942. The raid is notable in that it was the only time in U.S. military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. 16 modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around Tokyo. Unfortunately this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland China to land, crashland or bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is. Most of the Americans made it to China and safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. They paid dearly for helping, however, as it is estimated that the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese, vengefully searching for Doolittle's men! What evil bastages!! Incidentally, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle is greatly portrayed by Alec Baldwin in the film and, true to history, the picture shows Doolittle taking part in the daring mission. More historical accuracy.Some criticize that the Doolittle Raid doesn't belong in the film, but nothing could be further from the truth. If all the movie showed was the Pearl Harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. Showing the successful Doolittle Raid makes the film end on a positive note. What effect did the raid have at the time? It caused American moral to soar from the depths to which it had plunged after Pearl Harbor. It has the very same effect on modern viewers.CONCLUSION: In light of all the criticism I kept waiting for 'Pearl Harbor' to stumble and fail, but it never happened -- there's not one misstep. Yes, the viewer has to be open to and patient with the opening drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer CARE about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. I d have zero interest in seeing the 'Transformers' films, but this is fine movie-making. It provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.GRADE: A",9,1,1,12 March 2014
The Usual Suspects," Who IS Keyser Söze? Who freakin' cares?
","Released in 1995 and directed by Bryan Singer, 'The Usual Suspects' is a crime drama/mystery about five thugs who decide to team up and get revenge on the police (Keven Spacey, Gabriel Byrne, Steve Baldwin, Keven Pollak and Benicio Del Toro). After their successful operation, the five are manipulated by the legendary criminal Keyser Söze into taking a much riskier gig. One is captured and he's interrogated by the police (Chazz Palminteri & Giancarlo Esposito). The big question is: Who IS Keyser Söze? Pete Postlethwaite is on hand as Söze's right-hand man while Suzy Amis plays the babe of one of the thugs. This is a 'twist ending' flick and, honestly, the film is too reliant on it. The whole movie is just 'wait for the twist,' it isn't actually that entertaining to sit through. In fact, most of the dialog is pretty boring; and only had some value in the end. Moreover, the main characters are just foul-mouthed, tough-guy low-lifes, although Spacey's character is somewhat interesting. As such, it's next to impossible to care about them. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Yes, the ending is clever in some ways, but everything that goes on up to that point isn't really worth enduring. As far as the twist goes, I was able to pinpoint the identity of the mystery man down to two people; and I was right. But there are some interesting details to the twist that I doubt anyone could figure out without first knowing the ending and then re-watching the flick. But, after watching, I'm not interested in seeing it again. The story and the characters aren't worth it. The film didn't make me care enough to watch again. Filmmakers must understand that, for a movie to be enduring, it has to be about the journey not the destination. And, for me, the convoluted journey in 'The Usual Suspects' is just dull and laborious. If the characters were worthy and I cared about them I might be more interested, but that's not the case. Then there's something that I experienced a couple of times while observing the five main guys babble back and forth: I had the overwhelming sense that these were just actors playing 'hip' tough-tawkin' hooligans rather than the characters they were supposed to be. This is never a good sign. I can't believe the high rating this movie has on IMDb; the movie's seriously overrated.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Los Angeles area and New York City. GRADE: C-***SPOILER ALERT***I want to emphasize that this review does not criticize the film based on pretending to 'know the twist all along' (as stated above, I was able to figure out who the mystery man likely was, but not the other details). The problem is that the entire movie is based around listening to a guy make up a bunch of stuff. Gee, so all we really know is there was a ship that got torched and Kevin Spacey's character doesn't really have a limp. Okay, thanks for wasting my time with everything else. Great storytelling (rolling my eyes).",4,1,3,29 November 2016
Inside Out," Imaginative animated flick about what goes on in your mind
","Released in 2015, 'Inside Out' is a Pixar animated movie about the goings-on in a girl's head as her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco and she considers running away. The movie depicts emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust scrambling around to help the girl make the right decisions.I'm not the best person to appraise flicks like this because I don't typically watch animated pictures, but this one interested me because of the creative plot; I wanted to see how the filmmakers visualized the happenings inside a person's mind. In some ways it's reminiscent of Dr. Seuss and 'The Wizard of Oz.' In any case, it's imaginative and entertaining. I love Anger and I wanted Joy to knock Sadness off one of those cliffs. Bing Bong is a cool (goofy) character as well.GRADE: B+",7,3,24,2 February 2016
Die Hard 2," Big, dumb, fun action flick tries hard (or dies hard) to entertain
","RELEASED IN 1990, ' Die Hard 2: Die Harder' is the second of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. The story takes place at Dulles Airport in D.C. as John McClane (Bruce Willis) attempts to avert disaster when rogue military operatives seize control of the airport with plans to rescue a drug lord from justice (Franco Nero). Meanwhile McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is stuck in the air circling the airport with her nemesis from the previous film (William Atherton). Dennis Franz plays the head cop (with an attitude) at the airport while William Sadler plays the lead terrorist. John Amos appears as the head commando while Art Evans is on hand as a reasonable cop and Tom Bower as a helpful janitor.The Die Hard flicks fill the bill if you're in the mood for a big, dumb, fun action flick. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean 'dumb' in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable thrills rather than character defining drama or deep themes beyond 'genuinely good people may be flawed and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.' The story isn't as engaging as 2007's 'Live Free or Die Hard,' but it was good enough and the action scenes are out of this world. They're so over-the-top (with obvious plot holes) that you could write the movie off as absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone so it helps the viewer go along with the ridiculous things that happen rather than tune out.The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's 'The Gauntlet' where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's 'The Mummy Returns.' Thankfully, 'Die Hard 2' pretty much evades that ditch by giving us entertaining characters and a relatively compelling story.THE MOVIE RUNS 124 minutes and was shot in Colorado, Michigan and California.

Flashdance," The dance version of 'Rocky'
","Released in 1983, 'Flashdance' is a drama/music/romance film starring Jennifer Beals as, Alex Owens, an 18 year-old welder in Pittsburgh who dreams of being a professional dancer and longs to be accepted into a prestigious school. She dances at a nightclub in her spare time, which is contrasted by the strip club across the street, owned by a sleazebag who tries to lure the respectable dancers into his seedy lair (Lee Ving). One of her friends aspires to be a figure skater (Sunny Johnson) and another friend a stand-up comedian (Kyle T. Heffner). Meanwhile her tall, dark and handsome boss takes a liking to her (Michael Nouri). This is an entertaining dance flick with the requisite early 80's soundtrack. All the dance sequences were performed by the uncredited French dancer Marine Jahan, who later sued the producers for not crediting her (the brief break-dancing scene was done by a dude). While the wide-eyed Beals and Jahan are in top shape and comely enough, I favor Sunny (the skater).I was impressed by the quality characterizations for a relatively short sports movie. I call it a 'sports movie' because that's essentially what it is – 'Rocky' with a female protagonist and dancing instead of boxing. I also like the Pittsburgh locations. Despite my positive feelings, the less-popular 'Heavenly Bodies,' which came out 9½ months later and stars cutie Cynthia Dale, is superior IMHO. The film runs 95 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles. GRADE: B",7,0,1,4 June 2015
Resident Evil," Brilliant, mysterious, intense and creepy sci-fi-horror
","Paul Anderson's 'Resident Evil' was released in 2002 and is based on the video game of the same name. I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red poster & DVD cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing (not knowing it was 'Resident Evil'). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- something happens, but I don't want to give it away.That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the DVD. The set-up is intriguing and brilliantly executed.***PLOT SPOILER*** (Don't read the next paragraph unless you want to know the basic plot) A biological 'accident' causes the supercomputer that runs an underground complex to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. This installation is called The Hive. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and a commando force is sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer -- the Red Queen -- to shut down the facility and kill the people. It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies, which may sound totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable, for a sci-fi movie anyway. Milla and the commandos slowly discover the truth. Can they get out alive? ***END SPOILER*** POSITIVES: <ul><li>As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.</li></ul><ul><li>The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.</li></ul><ul><li>Milla herself is stunning.

Avengers: Endgame," How can they possibly save half of all living beings in the Universe?
","How are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in 'Infinity War' weren't just a dream): magic or time travel. All I'll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of 'Back to the Future II' (1989).'Endgame' (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.Everything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff's edge, and much more.Unfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can't concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie's overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.GRADE: B-",6,3,9,5 July 2019
Dirty Dancing," Entertaining hit with lush Appalachian locations, but the writing doesn't respect the intelligence of the viewer
","RELEASED IN 1987 and directed by Emile Ardolino, 'Dirty Dancing' stars Patrick Swayze as Johnny Castle, a working-class dance instructor at a mountain resort in the Catskills in 1963. Jennifer Grey costars as 'Baby,' the 17-year-old daughter of an affluent Jewish doctor vacationing at the resort. She takes the place of Johnny's dance partner after his partner gets pregnant, albeit not by Johnny. Baby naturally develops a crush.This was the hit romantic drama of 1987, but it actually didn't make as much at the domestic box office compared to the other two dance flicks of the 80s: 'Flashdance' (1983) made $95 million and 'Footloose' (1984) $80 million while 'Dirty Dancing' brought it $64 million. The two main cast members are a highlight. Swayze was in his prime and Jennifer Grey cute & nimble, like a fawn. In reality Grey was 26 years-old during filming, although she passes for late teens pretty well. Swayze, however, was 34 and looked it, albeit trim and fit.The lush Appalachian locations are outstanding and the story keeps your attention but you'll roll your eyes at the idiotic misunderstanding where Baby's father assumes Johnny's the one who got his partner pregnant and, for some strange reason, no one sets him straight. Not to mention, the characters always say the wrong thing at the wrong time, which perpetuates the misunderstanding. Also, the sexual union of Johnny & Baby is both premature and unbelievable in light of the time period, Baby's age (17 years-old) and her upbringing. Frankie Avalon was once asked about his early 60's 'Beach' movies if the male-female relationships were as 'squeaky clean' as portrayed and he answered (paraphrasing): 'As a teen back then 'going all the way' wasn't even considered an option.' The obvious exception would be disreputable kids from the 'other side of the tracks.'Moreover, the fact that Johnny is having sex with the doctor's daughter, a minor at that, can't win any points in his favor. Hence, even without the misunderstanding there's little reason for the father to warm up to Johnny. So why does the doctor show respect for Johnny at the end, a dude who's fornicating with his under-aged daughter and is clearly much older than her as well, although it could be argued that he's naïve and doesn't necessarily know they're having sex already. Flaws like these smack of lazy writing and are offensive to anyone with an ounce of intelligence.If you can look past these problems, however, the film is entertaining. The dance sequences shown in the staff area are akin to vertical sex with clothes on. I guess that's why it's called 'Dirty Dancing,' huh? Yet this is another flaw of the movie: these scenes are so amped-up and choreographed they shout to the viewer via megaphone: 'This is A MOVIE; it's NOT REAL.' Nonetheless, Grey's a cutie, Swayze's The Man and the beautiful Appalachian locations are a highlight, filmed at Mountain Lake Resort, Pembroke, Virginia, and Lake Lure, NC.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 45 minutes.

Quantum of Solace," Decent Bond flick marred by ridiculous quick-editing
","Released in 2008, 'Quantum of Solace' is the second Bond film with Daniel Craig as Agent 007. Bond seeks revenge for the death of his babe in the previous film as well as those responsible for an assassination attempt on M (Judi Dench). The trail leads from Italy to Haiti to Bolivia and Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a world-renowned developer of green technology. Greene is intent on securing a barren area of Bolivia in exchange for assisting General Medrano stage a coup there (Joaquín Cosio). Since the CIA looks the other way, only Bond stands in Greene's way with assistance from a retired spy and two beauties (Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton). M wonders if she can trust Bond or if his need for vengeance has corrupted him.Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond and I appreciate the serious vibe of his installments. The problem with 'Quantum of Solace,' the 22nd Bond film, is the rapid-fire editing during the action scenes. Take, for instance, the opening chase-sequence that takes place on the tollway that leads through mountain tunnels from Nice through Monte Carlo and down to Portofino in Italy. It's a spectacularly scenic area. Unfortunately you won't see much of it here, just quick flashes; more importantly, you'll hardly understand what's going on due to the moronic fast editing. The camera switches about 3 or 4 times per second! I have no doubt that the filmmakers think such quick angle changes convey energy, but when it's done this fast all it does is confuse, disorient and annoy the viewer. It wouldn't be so bad if this was the only sequence put together like this but, no, after Bond's initial meeting with M (Judi Dench) there's another ridiculous rapid-fire action scene.The filmmakers need to get a grip on this fact: James Bond is not a mindless action hero! He's too smart for that. He's the ultimate 'cool' attitude. Violence for him is an irritation resorted to only when necessary. He exists for the mental play, the checkmate and, later, the martini – shaken, not stirred; the babe too, of course. The only way the average viewer can successfully make it past the 25-minute mark of 'Quantum of Solace' and enjoy the movie is if s/he drinks a pot of heavily-caffeinated coffee beforehand. If you do this it's an entertaining Bond picture, but it's not in the top tier of the franchise.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in England, Italy, Austria, Spain, Panama (standing in for Haiti), Chili (the Atacama Desert) and Baja California (the last two standing in for Bolivia).GRADE: C+ or B-",6,0,1,30 October 2015
Independence Day," Blockbuster Sci-Fi with overdone comedy and inanities
","Released in 1996, 'Independence Day' (or 'ID4') chronicles events as the earth is threatened by malevolent aliens who wipe out entire cities. Bill Pullman plays the US President, Margaret Colin his aid and Mary McDonnell his wife. Will Smith plays a hotshot pilot and Vivica A. Fox his babe. Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid, James Duval and Brent Spiner are also on hand.I saw this movie when it was released while on vacation during the height of its hype (incidentally, at the very theater in Aurora, CO, where The Dark Knight Rises Massacre would occur 16 years later). While fun and entertaining as most blockbusters are, it didn't match the hoopla, so I've had mixed feelings about it ever since. On the positive side, the main characters are likable and there's a warmth to their relationships. I also like the feel-good quality of the movie in that it brings the whole world together to face a common enemy, despite our differences. In other words, it's not just Independence Day for America, but for Planet Earth. I also like the tie-in with Area 51, which shows that some thought was put into the script beyond just blowing up iconic buildings and whole cities. The scene where the captured alien utilizes Dr. Brakish Okun's vocal chords to speak is well done. Also, Margaret Colin looks great throughout.What I don't like is the mixture of serious sci-fi with overdone comedy and the numerous 'Yeah, right' moments. Comedy works with serious sci-fi/adventure/drama/thriller/horror as long as it's not overdone. The Terminator flicks are good examples, even Star Trek. In 'ID4' too much of the comedy and inanities take you OUT of the story rather than take you IN. The comedic asides seem disjointed from the plot rather than enhancing it. Despite the likable characters and warmth thereof, they too often come off empty and adolescent. The story focuses on the alien threat and human response so there's little character development of value. I enjoy a sci-fi flick even when its fantasy extends into the absurd and far-fetched, so long as there is some payoff -- some message of significance, some portrayal of what might or could possibly be, some character development that draws the viewer into the story and provides some basis for caring about what's happening. There's not enough of this in 'ID4.' That said, there's a lot to enjoy as a shallow sci-fi blockbuster with a likable cast and some thrilling sequences. The key is not taking it too seriously since it doesn't take itself seriously. The film is overlong at 145 minutes and was shot all over the USA with establishing shots from around the world.

The Dirty Dozen," Great World War II flick about a group of outcasts
","Released in 1967, 'The Dirty Dozen' stars Lee Marvin as a tough Major who enlists and trains a group of criminal soldiers for a risky mission behind enemy lines on the eve of D-Day. If they survive they might be pardoned. The all-star cast is a highlight and includes Charles Bronson, Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, John Cassavetes, Robert Ryan, George Kennedy, Donald Sutherland, Clint Walker and Richard Jaeckel.The long first act involves the training of the undisciplined soldiers, the shorter second act their first test in war games with another platoon, and the last act their dangerous mission in Brittany, France, which involves an assault on a lavish château that's hosting a meeting of high-ranking German soldiers. Killing as many as possible should hamper the German response to D-Day.The film's long at two and a half hours, but it masterfully sustains your interest because it focuses on the characters. When the raid on the château finally comes you KNOW these characters and are rooting for them. Unfortunately, most of 'em don't make it.The château assault presents a controversy: Was it right for them to throw grenades and gasoline down air vents to blow-up German officers AND their women in the bunker underneath the château? A couple of the members of the dozen ask the Major if he was sure he wanted them to do it and he told them to do it. So the soldiers were just following orders, which doesn't make it right. Keep in mind that their original mission was to kill as many high-ranking officers at the château as possible to pave the way for a successful D-Day operation, so that's precisely what they did. The women could be considered collateral damage. I'm not saying this justifies their actions, but we were in a state of war and victory was necessary for the war to end and restore peace. The film was shot entirely in England.GRADE: A",9,0,4,22 May 2014
Gone with the Wind," Scarlett, Rhett, Melanie, Ashley, Mammy and Tara
","Released in 1939 and directed by Victor Fleming, 'Gone with the Wind' chronicles events at a Georgia plantation and points nearby before, during and after the Civil War. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable star as Scarlett and Rhett while Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard play Melanie and Ashley. Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen appear as Mammy and Prissy.This is certainly an iconic movie and obviously spectacular in its day, but it was outdone by the same production team seven years later with 'Duel in the Sun' (1946), which is just an all-around superior movie and holds up better all these decades later. Some people wrongly diss 'Gone with the Wind' for depicting plantation life and the requisite slavery, not to mention portraying it in a relatively neutral light, but this institution was a fact-of-life in the Deep South at the time and, believe it or not, not all slave owners were inhuman monsters dripping with evil.The opening act is weak with its hokey writing/acting. I half expected the peripheral cast to break out in choreographed song & dance at any moment. Once you get used to the quaint vibe, however, the story pretty much takes you in and really perks up with the burning of Atlanta. Unfortunately, Scarlett is a weak protagonist. She's selfish, neurotic and annoying despite her physical beauty. In the second half, just when you think she's redeemable, you find out you're wrong. Rhett isn't much better, but at least he has that charismatic gleam. Actually, I'm kinda impressed that they used these two as the protagonists because they're definitely antiheroes long before the antihero came into vogue. Melanie and Ashley are the true heroes of the movie, particularly the former.Another problem is that, except for establishing shots (in Arkansas and Georgia), the movie was filmed in Southern California, including the outdoor sequences, and it's too obvious. An additional issue is that the last 45 minutes are generally weak for several reasons and the story just goes on & on when it seriously needed to wrap up. And then there's the hilariously delivered final line by Scarlett. Still, the movie's iconic and there's enough good here to make it worth checking out, as long as you can handle old-fashioned melodrama.For a more realistic depiction of the Plantation Era, albeit on a TV budget, check out 1980's 'Beulah Land,' which was shot on an actual plantation and points nearby in Natchez, Mississippi.The film runs 335 minutes (5 minutes shy of 4 hours).GRADE: B-",6,1,6,25 June 2017
The Butterfly Effect," It is said that the mere flutter of a butterfly can impact things halfway around the world
","Released in 2004 and directed/written by Eric Bress & J. Mackye Gruber, 'The Butterfly Effect' is a sci-fi/thriller/horror starring Ashton Kutcher as a young man who suffers blackouts during significant events of his life. In college he finds a way to remember these lost memories and, more significantly, alter bad events by supernaturally traveling to the past via focusing on the words in his old journals. Unfortunately, changing the past has unforeseen repercussions. Amy Smart plays his girlfriend and William Lee Scott her psycho (or maybe not) brother. Melora Walters appears as his mother while Elden Henson plays his pal, Lenny.This is an ambitious movie that cogently shows how changing one element of the past has a ripple effect, both positive and negative. The constant change in timeline makes the story seem jumbled at first, but the movie finds its footing and everything ultimately makes sense. Kutcher is surprisingly good in the lead role while Amy is solid in support, and fetching. Where the movie sometimes goes off the rails is the exaggerated behavior of some of the characters throughout. The way they act just doesn't ring true and it comes across goofy, like characters in a comedic slasher flick. It's as if the writers don't understand how real people act in the situations in question; even wackos don't behave as portrayed. As such, these sequences come off surreal at best. But, if you can handle this glaring flaw, 'The Butterfly Effect' is a worthwhile quasi-horror flick, although be forewarned that icky topics are breached (but thankfully only breached). The film runs 113 minutes while the Director's Cut with the originally-intended ending runs 120 minutes. The consensus is that the theatrical version is superior to the bleak, cold and grotesque climax of the Director's Cut. The locations are awesome, by the way, shot in the Vancouver area.

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," The last seven months in the life of Jesse James
","Released in 2007 and directed by Andrew Dominik, 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' stars Brad Pitt as the famous outlaw in a chronicling of the last seven months of his life. The movie begins with the Blue Cut Train Robbery that took place in Missouri on September 7, 1881. Casey Affleck co-stars as Robert Ford, a 20 year-old member of Jesse's gang, who kills James for the reward, but also (presumeably) because he and his brother, Charles (Sam Rockwell), feared Jesse was going to kill them. The final 25 minutes detail the Ford brothers lives over the course of the next decade after James' execution on April 3, 1882. Paul Schneider,Garret Dillahunt, Jeremy Renner, Sam Shepard, Mary-Louise Parker, Kailin See and Zooey Deschanel have notable support roles.This is a funereal, realistic Western consisting of long dramatic sequences spiced with flashes of violence. Although critically praised, it bombed at the box office and some people scoff at it as a slow bore, but I found it pretty mesmerizing, even haunting. There are numerous highlights during its 2 hour and 40 minutes, like the opening train robbery, the outhouse rendezvous between Schneider and See, the tense gunfight in the upstairs of a frontier house, Jesse's death and the interesting aftermath.The movie makes a point of depicting Jesse as a paranoid man on his way to an early grave because of his foolish choice to be an unrepentant outlaw. At least Frank James (Shepard) had the scruples to leave outlawry and move east. Jesse is shown lamenting what his life had become and even shooting one of his comrades in the back, like a coward, not to mention abusing an adolescent. Yes, Ford later shoots Jesse in the back, but it had to be done. Jesse's days were numbered due to his own bad choices. Plus Robert and his brother were afraid that Jesse was going to shoot them at any moment. Also keep in mind that Jesse wasn't no frickin' Robin Hood; he stole from the rich and regular folks alike and gave to... well, himself. In light of all this the title of the movie is purely ironic, but when the legend becomes fact, print the legend, as they say.The Alberta and Manitoba locations are picturesque, but they don't look like Missouri and Kentucky (and surrounding states), where the events took place. These are Eastern states, albeit 'midwest.' The locations in the movie look like what they are -- the northern prairie. 'The Long Riders' (1980) is more accurate on this count.GRADE: B+",7,0,0,16 October 2016
Blue Crush," Hope for scum
","Released in 2002, 'Blue Crush' tells the story of three young female surfers in Hawaii who support their lifestyle as maids at a high-class hotel. Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) has dreams of going professional, but she has to get over her past failures and her family's breakup to succeed. In the meantime a vacationing NFL quarterback (Matthew Davis) romances her and she has to determine if their relationship is real or just a fling (for him, that is). Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake co-star as Anne Marie's surfing friends.As you can see, 'Blue Crush' is a 'sports film' in the manner of 'Karate Kid' and a host of others. Although some of these movies go the comedy route -- e.g. 'Cloud 9' and 'Bad News Bears' -- 'Crush' is a serious drama with fun flashes.Filmed on the beaches/resorts of O'ahu, Hawaii, this is a beautiful and exhilarating film to watch, the perfect remedy if the weather in your area has been dreary.There's no profanity, raunch or t&a exploitation but, to be expected, the film features some good-looking women in swimwear throughout its 104-minute runtime (dudes too, if you're a woman). By 'good-looking' I mean realistically so, not like 'Baywatch' which normally featured masses of ultra-hot babes swarming the beaches.For the first hour the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, nothing great but moderately entertaining for this type of flick, and then something happened at the the 58-minute mark that struck a chord with me. Anne Marie hits the waves with her friend (Rodriquez) to prepare for the Pipeline Masters as we hear the song 'Youth of the Nation' by P.O.D. This sequence touched me for some reason. The music & lyrics are emotionally potent and effectively set the tone for the remainder of the film.'Youth of the Nation' exemplifies the zeitgeist of the new millennium just as 'My Generation' perfectly represents the mid-60s and 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' typifies the 90s (I was gonna say 'and just as 'Muskrat Love' typifies the 70s' as a joke but decided not to, lol). Anyway, everyone's heard the song by now but if you're not sure go to youtube and listen to it with lyrics; it's an incredible piece, to say the least, and dig those heartrending lyrics! It's reality, my friend.For me, the film's just compelling enough to give a marginal thumbs up. Fans of surfing and Bosworth (or any of the other actors) will appreciate 'Blue Crush' more than me. But I was moved by the above musical interlude and one other thing...What affected me most with the story is the picture of the three maids, impoverished and disdained by the snobs but full of youthful zeal and hope. It strangely reminded me of something I experienced on my last trip to Southern California. I was leaving the last showing of a theater late at night and spied the janitorial crew coming in to clean with their mops & buckets. They were Mexicans, mostly young, and possibly illegal aliens. Everyone walked by them as if they were invisible, like they were the scum of society or something. But I made a point to acknowledge them and smile. I don't feel I deserve a medal for this or anything; it's just that I made a decision long ago that, no matter how far I go in life, I'm not going to look down on or ignore those in a more modest position. Why? I don't know, maybe because I'M scum.The film runs 104 minutes.GRADE: B-",6,0,0,12 March 2014
Saving Private Ryan," Great WWII war action in France, but too much of the drama is weak
","RELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg, 'Saving Private Ryan' (SPR) is about the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from June 6-16, 1944. The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.No one's supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.In between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn't find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I've seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie, e.g. the original 'Apocalypse Now' (1979).Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps.In light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as 'the greatest war movie ever made.' Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired.I've heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken 'verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion.' I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father's stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it's resolved (ooh, the Captain's a high school teacher, whoopee).Nevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can't beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 49 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France.

The Pianist," A Jewish musician trying to survive the German occupation of Warsaw
","Released in 2002, 'The Pianist' is Roman Polanski's account of the real-life Hebrew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) whose family was banished to the Warsaw ghetto with thousands of other Jews after the German invasion. Szpilman is separated from his family members when they're carted off to be slaughtered and does whatever he must to survive until the Allies defeat Germany. He's dependent on others while hiding out and, like they say, sometimes help comes from the most unexpected sources.Like 1993's 'Schindler's List,' 'The Pianist' is a thoroughly realistic WWII drama that addresses the Holocaust with flashes of violence and atrocities, only marred by the stereotypical boorish depiction of practically every member of the Wehrmacht. Needless to say, you have to be in the right mode for a movie like this and you have to be willing to invest a solid hour before things get interesting; by the final hour you'll be hooked until the end; that is, unless you have ADHD and consume only cartoony 'blockbusters.'Some have complained that Szpilman's a lousy protagonist for this type of movie because he never does anything heroic and essentially waits it out. Answer: That's why it's called 'The Pianist' and not 'The Warrior Jew' or 'Rambo 5: Kraut Killer.' He was a simple musician who did what he could to survive, but that's not all he does; he also smuggles weapons into the ghetto, which are used later in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. When he eventually hides out in various apartments he doesn't have a weapon. What's he supposed to do, run into the streets and take on German soldiers by himself with a club or a kitchen knife? Even going out with a machine gun would've been foolish and suicidal. Szpilman's a survivor who does some minor heroic things. For those who demand a more standout hero, look no further than Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann); he's the hero of the story. The movie effectively shows the pianist's view of the war, which is the window through which the viewer observes the historical events. 'Schindler's List' shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Gentile who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the top and views both Nazis and Jews from a position of safety. Oskar Schindler naturally had a more panoramic, birds-eye view of the Holocaust whereas 'The Pianist' shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Jew who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the bottom and sees both Nazis and Jews from a position of danger. The former is a better film for understanding the machinery of the Holocaust while 'The Pianist' is a better film to watch if you want to know what it was like to experience the Holocaust first hand as an ordinary Jew.The movie runs 2½ hours and was shot in Poland (including Warsaw where the events in the movie take place) and Germany.

Seabiscuit," Hope for the broken via a quirky, forsaken race horse
","During the Depression, an undersized, 'lazy' horse named Seabiscuit becomes a champion, lifting the spirits of both its team and that of the nation. Jeff Bridges plays the owner, Tobey Maguire the jockey and Chris Cooper the trainer. Valerie Mahaffey is on hand as the owner's wife.Based on the real story, 'Seabiscuit' (2003) is reminiscent in tone of another timeless historical drama starring Bridges, 'Tucker: The Man and His Dream' (1988) by Francis Ford Coppola. I prefer the underrated 'Tucker' because it's snappier and less vague, but 'Seabiscuit' ain't no slouch.Like the historically-based 'Jeremiah Johnson' (1972) the manner of storytelling respects the intelligence of the viewer to sometimes read between the lines. One of the best parts is the build-up to the race with War Admiral and the thrilling race itself. Not knowing the real-life events, a couple of the twists were surprising. The first act, however, seems bogged down by extraneous details about the owner.The film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes and was shot in California, New York and Kentucky.GRADE: B",7,0,0,31 January 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Amusing send-up of slasher hillbilly flicks
","RELEASED IN 2010 and written & directed by Eli Craig, 'Tucker & Dale vs. Evil' is a comedy/horror about genial West Virginian hillbillies Tucker & Dale (Alan Tudyk & Tyler Labine) who visit their newly acquired rundown cabin-in-the-woods wherein they are mistaken as psycho hilljack killers by a group of vacationing college youths.This is a well-done lampoon of flicks like 'Deliverance' (1972) 'Wrong Turn' (2003) and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974). Besides being consistently amusing, what works best is that you get to know Tucker and, especially, Dale, as well as the main girl (Katrina Bowden), who's very reminiscent of Christine Taylor (from 'The Brady Bunch Movie'), albeit taller. Freckled cutie Chelan Simmons looks her best clad in daisy dukes throughout. The coniferous woods give away that this was shot in the Great Northwest and not West Virginia, where the events purportedly take place.

Revolutionary Road," What if Jack & Rose married and settled into the conventional American grind?
","The Wheelers are a couple with two kids living in the suburbs of Connecticut in the '50s. Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) marches off to the big city five times a week, ten hours a day, to a job he hates whereas April (Kate Winslet) takes care of things on the home front, including their hardly-seen children. April's dream of being an actress has failed and she vents her frustrations on Frank. Emasculated, he has a meaningless affair to prove his manhood to himself. Meanwhile April suggests a wild idea for them to move to Paris because Frank's war tales describe it as a place of exhilaration and April desperately wants him to regain that aura of vitality he had when they first met. Will they escape the comatose corner they've painted themselves into or will they join the masses of (supposedly) living dead in their midst?Eleven years after their mega-hit 'Titanic' (1997), Kate and Leonardo reunite for 'Revolutionary Road,' released in January, 2009. Kate has shed her unappealing baby fat and is now a curvy beauty whereas Leonardo is a man and no longer has that boyish vibe.I enjoy a good drama now and then, like the excellent 'Snow Angels' (2007), the potent 'Grand Canyon' (1991) or the masterpiece 'Dead Poets Society' (1989), but 'Revolutionary Road' fails to achieve the greatness of those films, mainly because the characters and their story are fairly boring. The film's just not that engrossing, which is my core criterion for evaluating any flick. In quality and theme, it's reminiscent of 'Joe Versus the Volcano' (1990).Like 'Joe,' it's a slyly offbeat drama despite being about American conventionality. The best parts involve Michael Shannon as John, the mentally disturbed son of the real estate lady (Kathy Bates), a fascinating character. Everyone else in the Wheeler's lives thinks their plans to give up their suburban paradise are crazy (big surprise). But John sees the brilliance and necessity of the plan. In other words, the only person who 'gets' the plight of the Wheelers is this nigh-insane dude. But he's not really crazy. John is gifted at seeing through a facade to get to the core of a matter, the awesome or awful truth. And he has no inhibitions about speaking his mind, good or bad. At heart, John is a beatnik, the 50's precursor to the hippie. He represents the first wave of the 60's counter-culture, a generation of youth who discerned the cracks in the post-war 'paradise,' and rebelled, for better or worse.Some important questions are raised: Is life just having a marriage, a family, a well-paying job (you loathe) and a nice home in the pleasant suburbs, plus cigarettes and drinks without end? Or is there more? What about love? What about genuineness? What about unrealized, unused or ignored talents and dreams? What about (gasp) God?'Revolutionary Road' has some other positives: it's expertly made, has a good score by Thomas Newman and evokes some haunting moments.Some have suggested that the film is one POSSIBLE outcome if Jack had survived the end of 'Titanic' and married Rose: The once spirited, carefree Jack settles into the robotic grind to pay the bills while Kate is left frustrated at home in suburbia. Regrettably, it's overall mediocre due to the unengrossing characters and their story, which of course links to the theme its espousing.Yet it does have flashes of greatness and it makes you reflect on its points. In some ways, the same message is addressed in 'Dead Poets Society' (and 'Grand Canyon,' to a lesser degree): rejecting the box society tries to confine you, throwing caution to the wind, and going after your dreams. The difference is that 'Dead Poets Society' (and 'Grand Canyon') accomplished this with absorbing stories whereas 'Revolutionary Road' doesn't. Generally speaking, that is. Yet it's still worth catching if its themes trip your trigger.The film runs almost 2 hours and was shot in Connecticut & New York City.GRADE: C+",5,1,2,31 October 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," Freedom from the shackles of 'civilization'
","David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia may be well over 50 years old now, but it stands the test of time like all truly great works.The movie details T.E. Lawrence's experiences as a British liaison who inspires the Arab revolt against Turkish rule during World War 1 (1916-1918).At 3 hours and 47 minutes this is a LONG movie but somehow strangely hypnotic. The awesome music plays a huge part in this effect.If you're weary of the moronic approach of too many modern films (too much CGI and roll-your-eyes action, etc.) Lawrence of Arabia is the perfect antidote.It's mainly the story of a European man who sheds his stuffy 'civilized' upbringing to revel in a new-found freedom in the desert wilderness as he integrates with the Arabs and basks in their glowing acceptance. He accomplishes this by, first, disregarding his superior's orders and honestly relating to the Arabs and, second, by proving himself unbiased to any specific tribe and willing to risk everything in helping them to defeat the Turks.Those spoiled by modern blockbusters won't likely appreciate 'Lawrence of Arabia' but those who have an eye for artistic cinema will revel in it.GRADE: A",9,3,5,8 June 2014

In tone & quality the movie's akin to 2008's 'From Within,' but more haunting and less talky, not to mention without the awkwardly overt commentary on Christian legalism vs. wicca. The film scores good marks in the female department with Bailey Spry ('Annie' in the prologue), Maika Monroe ('Jay') and Lili Sepe ('Kelly'); Olivia Luccardi too ('Yara').COMMENTARY ON MAIN THEME (Don't read until you see the movie): The premise isn't juvenile at all, as some clueless critic suggested. In fact, it reflects real life as the potentially fatal curse for loose sex is akin to venereal disease, albeit spiritually rooted. It's the casual-sex-equals-death motif of slasher flicks but deeper. The 'monster' in the movie represents the repercussions of meaningless sex, which may be physical, psychological or spiritual, but there is a price to pay. Two of the characters are childhood friends and their union is the antithesis of casual. Note the subtle yet potent climax. In addition, there are interesting subthemes to be gleaned, like the safe suburbs vs. the danger of the rundown inner city.

The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.This is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016) and 'Thor: Ragnarok' (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is 'Iron Man 2' (2010). If you haven't already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing 'Infinity War,' as well as 'Black Panther' (2018) and the two 'Guardians of the Galaxy' flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you'll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.'Infinity War' is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn't conducive to suspense or great drama. It's merely decent with overkill CGI. The big battle in the closing act with the easily slaughtered four-armed dog-creatures is curiously dull; moreover, the attempts at humor sometimes feel forced and fall flat, but several jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, e.g. 'Rabbit.' Thankfully, the film adds moving drama and gets extra points for a bold, poignant climax, which sets up the 2019 sequel 'Endgame.'THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 29 minute and was shot in New York City, Scotland and Philippines with studio work done in Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayetteville, Georgia.

Sharon Tate (Margo Robbie) & Roman Polanski are neighbors with Jay Sebring always hanging around (Emile Hirsch). Meanwhile the Manson Family nutjobs are lurking in the background, prepping to attack.'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood' (2019) is Quentin Tarantino's 9th full film and, for me, ranks somewhere in the middle of his oeuvre. It may not be as great as 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) and 'Django Unchained' (2012), but it places well with 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009), 'Jackie Brown' (1997) and 'The Hateful Eight' (2015).A famous director once succinctly defined a great movie as such: Three good scenes, no bad scenes. While the second part of this definition is debatable with 'Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood,' seeing as how the movie could've certainly been tightened up (there are some dull sequences), there's no doubt that it fulfills the first part.My three favorite scenes are: The amusing satirical Bruce Lee confrontation; the great Spahn Ranch episode, which effectively creates an underlying sense of menace; and, of course, the entertaining hippie attack in the final act.Thankfully, there are numerous additional gems: The friendship and respect of Rick and Cliff; the audacious flamethrower sequence; Rick's breakdown with the precocious girl actor (not actress); the beautiful women throughout; the great cast, including several celeb cameos; the entertaining soundtrack; Brandi, the pit bull; Rick's meltdown in his trailer; Rick finally pulling off a quality acting scene via ad libbing; George Spahn not remembering Cliff; everything (surprisingly) turning out to be precisely as so-and-so said; the allusion to what MAY have happened to Cliff's nagging wife (Rebecca Gayheart) on the boat; the way it should have turned out on that infamous night; and the heartwarming close,The film runs 2 hour, 41 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: A-",8,3,7,16 September 2019

","Released in 2012 and directed & written by Quentin Tarantino, 'Django Unchained' stars Christoph Waltz as an ex-dentist who befriends an ex-slave, Django (Jamie Foxx) in West Texas a couple of years before the Civil War; they team-up as bounty hunters once they realize how good they jell. The second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a Mississippi plantation owned by pompous Southerner 'Monsieur' Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) in order to rescue Django's wife (Kerry Washington). Samuel L. Jackson plays Candie's overly loyal house slave.This is an excellent American Western with Spaghetti Western elements featuring Tarantino's typical artistic flourishes. It takes place in the West AND in the South, which is reminiscent of the underrated 'Nevada Smith' (1966), one of my favorite Westerns. Waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he & Foxx have good chemistry. There's a nice mix of interesting dialogues, amusing moments and over-the-top action. Unfortunately, but to be expected, Tarantino goes overboard with the 'n' word and the blood-letting, the latter to the point of cartoonish-ness. Nevertheless, this is an original Western that is vibrant with creativity, including stunning locations, cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrack/score, which includes cuts by Ennio Morricone, like the excellent 'Hornets' Nest,' the imaginative 'The Braying Mule' and the moving 'Ancora Qui.' It's all-around superior to 'The Hateful Eight' (2015) because it's not limited by a one-room whodunit plot (although 'Hateful' has its unique points of interest).The movie runs 165 minutes and was shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Evergreen Plantation & New Orleans, Louisiana; and several locations in California (Lone Pine, Alabama Hills, Semi Valley, Melody Ranch, Santa Clarita, Independence & Los Angeles). The cast includes numerous peripheral notables, e.g. Ato Essandohs, Don Stroud, James Remar, Bruce Dern, Ato Essandoh, Franco Nero, Don Johnson, Amber Tamblyn and several others.GRADE: A",9,0,1,3 July 2017
Peaceful Warrior," Great bits of wisdom with contrivances
","'Peaceful Warrior' (2006) is one of those 'almost good' films. It's a worthwhile movie but it's too formulaic and just seems to lack the necessary mojo to pull it out its pedestrian plotting.Based on Dan Millman's hit 1980 book that I've never read, 'Peaceful Warrior' is reminiscent of 'The Karate Kid' and 'Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story' albeit with gymnastics substituting for martial arts.Although I enjoyed the constant stream of wisdom that flowed from Nick Nolte's character, 'Socrates,' the film took a wrong turn with him almost immediately by implying that he had the power to instantaneously levitate 15 feet. From there it gets even weirder. By the end of the film one wonders if he's even real at all. I felt this took away from his character rather than make him more intriguing. Regardless, Nolte does a respectable job in the role and, again, I did enjoy his many gems of wisdom throughout. Some say his philosophies reflects a Buddhist mindset, but I saw Biblical Christianity. For instance:<ul><li>The stress on service and humility, i.e. servanthood. </li></ul><ul><li>'Putting out the trash,' i.e. putting off the old man (the flesh) and putting on the new (the spirit). </li></ul><ul><li>Random thoughts are not you but they can become you if you embrace them and allow them to control/lead you. </li></ul><ul><li>Joy despite the mundane. </li></ul><ul><li>Discerning the real spirit of others (in the compassionate sense, although sometimes for protection). </li></ul><ul><li>Give to those who ask of you. </li></ul><ul><li>Turning the cheek as one's initial response to antagonism (but, keep in mind, you only have two cheeks, facially speaking).</li></ul>And much more. These are axioms, universal truths that are true regardless of one's lineage, culture or present belief system. It's this aspect and the character of Socrates that make the film worthwhile.Other than that, though, the story is too formulaic. The plot mechanics are just too obvious. The viewer's aware of the contrivances just as much as the peripheral actors, who fail to pull off the material because of it. But the main four or so actors do a splendid job despite these negatives (Nolte, Scott Mechlowicz, Amy Smart and Agnes Bruckner).GRADE: C+",5,0,2,3 December 2011
Ghost Rider," 'You can't live in fear'
","Mark Steven Johnson's 'Ghost Rider' (2007) combines Faust and Spider-Man and mixes in elements of all the variations of the Ghost Rider comics up to the present, including the 50's Western hero, but it's main inspiration is the 70s-80s comic featuring Johnny Blaze as the protagonist.What makes Ghost Rider appealing? Well, the only thing cooler than a guy in black leather and chains driving a Harley is a flaming skeleton in black leather and chains driving a supernatural flaming Harley. That pretty much explains it.THE PLOT: Johnny Blaze and his father make a living as Evel Knieval-like stunt riders in a carnival. When Johnny's dad is diagnosed with cancer he is misled into making a deal with the devil. His father is healed of the cancer but Satan makes sure he dies in a stunt accident. Because of Johnny's foolish deal he is cursed to become the nigh-invincible Ghost Rider -- a supernatural flaming skeleton.Some criticize Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze because Blaze is supposed to be about 30 years old, while Cage was around 41. Yeah, someone like James Franco would have been better for the role, especially since Franco looks exactly like Mike Ploog's version of Blaze, but Cage does a fine job. Besides, Cage is in great shape and I know guys 25 years old who look older than him. As for Eva Mendes, who plays Johnny's girlfriend, she's ten years younger than Cage and is both voluptuous and adequate in the role.Some criticize the film as too serious, others as too goofy, but the fact is that 'Ghost Rider' has the same general tone as all the other superhero flicks released since 2000. It's a serious story for the most part, although completely unbelievable due to the subject matter, with some humor thrown in for good measure. In other words, it's neither deathly serious nor a campy goof-fest; it rides the line between these two extremes.If all you want out of 'Ghost Rider' is an entertaining supernatural superhero flick 'Ghost Rider' delivers and is worth viewing for this purpose. But the film delivers on a deeper level. Here are a smattering of noteworthy elements: <ul><li>Note that Johnny is misled into 'selling his soul' to the devil and has to face the negative consequences of his decision. Few people will literally 'sell their soul' to Satan as shown in the story but we can all relate to the struggle with the evil that exists within our own hearts. If we decide to live according to the inclinations of our lower, destructive, selfish nature are we not, in a sense, 'selling our soul' to the devil? (regardless of whether you view the devil as a literal spiritual being or merely as a symbol of potential human evil). Whenever we choose to live according to this lower nature will we not automatically perform evil and, in that sense, fulfill the devil's will? (ditto).</li></ul><ul><li>Peter Fonda as Satan is perfect and entertaining, as is Sam Elliott as the old Westerner.</li></ul><ul><li>Love is an important theme in the story. Johnny 'sells his soul' for love of his father. He didn't do it for greed or some other carnal purpose. This is agape love, self-sacrificial love, love in it's highest and purest form. This puts Johnny on God's side (as Elliott's character observes in the film) and makes him a serious threat to the devil's purposes on earth.</li></ul><ul><li>We also witness Blaze's great love for Roxanne and vice versa, as well as Mack's love for Johnny, etc.</li></ul><ul><li>This is contrasted by the total absence of love in Satan's kingdom. The devil hates his son and vice versa. This is a fitting depiction because God is described as love in the Bible; and since Satan has chosen to separate from God and be His enemy, he has naturally separated himself from love and become love's enemy. Hate in all its ugly manifestations is therefore the essence of the devil's kingdom and relationships.</li></ul><ul><li>When Blaze first turns into the Ghost Rider and goes for a ride in his flame cycle he causes great havoc wherever he goes. You'll note that this is much toned down in his later excursions as Ghost Rider. The explanation? Johnny simply didn't know how to control the supernatural hellfire and 'spirit of vengeance' during his initial conversion.</li></ul><ul><li>Although it's supposed to be amusing, it makes sense that Johnny would listen to The Carpenters in his down time. Blaze's daredevil lifestyle and his problems with the Ghost Rider curse would understandably cause him a great deal of stress. Listening to Karen's ultra-soothing voice would be a great pacifier.</li></ul><ul><li>There's a great scene of Ghost Rider riding off the top of a skyscrapper, whipping his chain in exulting fury, and then riding full blast down the building smashing into the pavement below as police and onlookers observe in total disbelief.</li></ul><ul><li>In the comics Blackheart was the only comic character that ever sent chills down my spine (in Ann Nocenti's Daredevil). I didn't get this feeling from Wes Bentley's portrayal in the film, although there's a hint of that. Regardless, Bentley does a fine job in the role. And Blackheart's total ugly wickedness is certainly revealed or demonstrated here and there.</li></ul><ul><li>There's a great musical interlude featuring the Ghost Rider and the Caretaker (Elliott) riding through the night desert for hundreds of miles to San Vengaza. Fittingly, the song is a modern hard rock version of 'Ghost Riders in the Sky' (I love that song! Who doesn't?) </li></ul><ul><li>The picture was filmed in Victoria, Australia, and the city of Melbourne.</li></ul><ul><li>The Ghost Rider himself (itself?) is a triumph of special effects. Needless to say, the film is enjoyable just to look at.</li></ul>GRADE: B+",7,1,1,24 April 2015
X-Men: The Last Stand," A good finale to the original trilogy
","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant 'X' gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a 'Brotherhood of Mutants' with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - 'X-Men' (2000), 'X2: X-Men United' (2003) and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006).'X-Men: The Last Stand' is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma over taking a cure in order to have human intimacy, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict symbolizing the universal clash of flesh and spirit (id and super-ego), Cyclop's grief and astonishing discovery, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.On the downside, the big clash on Alcatraz Island feels routine and dull. They should've kept the focus on the Dark Phoenix, but the producers probably felt this would take away from the other characters, plus they wanted the clichéd big battle sequence. Nevertheless, there's enough good here to appreciate.GRADE: B+",7,3,4,10 April 2012
Good Will Hunting," F***, Will Hunting (the character) isn't that f***ing good
","I don't usually talk like that; I'm just poking fun at the characters in the film. If you find that blurb offensive you'd better skip this movie.'Good Will Hunting' (1997) tells the story of a young genius, Will Hunting (Matt Damon), who comes from a tough neighborhood in South Boston and works as a janitor at MIT. A Math professor, Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgård), posts a difficult problem on the board and is amazed to discover that Will solves it. Will gets in trouble with the law but Lambeau gives succor and enlists the help of psychologist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams) to get him on the right path. Meanwhile Will is falling for a Harvard girl (Minnie Driver).The plot of a genius janitor is great and I thought I'd like the film more than I did, but a couple of things really bog it down. For one, Will Hunting is not a 'good' person, as the title suggests (I'm sure they were being ironic). In fact, he's so smart he's stupid. Doesn't he know that smoking will destroy his body and send him to an early grave? But that's the least of Will's shortcomings. He's arrogant and unnecessarily mean. For instance, Professor Lambeau visits him in jail and Will's first words are, 'What the f*** do you want?' Could anyone be that stupid? How about, 'Hi, I'm Will. Who are you, Sir?' I get it -- he's from a tough neighborhood and was abused as a kid, but 99% of guys from tough neighborhoods who were abused as kids don't talk unnecessary sheet like Will does in this film. In fact, too much of the cussing rings untrue. Will and his three friends from South Boston (including Ben Affleck) use the f-word practically every other word and it strikes an inauthentic chord. Yes, I get it -- they're trying to act like hooligans from a rough neighborhood -- but they try too hard and it comes off contrived. I should add that I hail from a hooligan-oriented neighborhood where the gang cussed, drank & smoked like sailors, but even we could construe eight words together without throwing in the f-word. I have no problem with realistic cussing in films; in fact, I prefer it. But when it's so over-the-top that it seems artificial it detracts from the drama. Furthermore, Damon doesn't LOOK like a tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks (neither does Ben, but he's a little better). Matt's miscast because he just looks too soft with his baby-face. I think he knew this because he tries too hard to be a tough punk, and it shows. The fact that the main protagonist is thoroughly unlikable takes away from the story. Who cares about some disrespectful punk who doesn't care to better himself, genius or not? As a result, the drama isn't nearly as compelling as it could've been. When Sean (Williams) finally gets Will to break at the end, I wasn't much interested. Still, if you can handle the trying-too-hard-to-appear-tough acting and dialog, 'Good Will Hunting' is worth catching if you like dramas. For one, Robin Williams is great in an atypical role as a serious psycho-therapist who is able to handle Will and overcome his (genius) defense mechanisms. Skarsgård is also excellent. And please don't take my criticisms the wrong way because there IS some good drama in this film, but it's buried underneath contrived writing and the corresponding performances (mainly Matt and Ben).Incidentally, Minnie and Matt hooked up after this movie, so the romantic sparks are real.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot on location in Massachusetts and Toronto.GRADE: C+",5,3,5,12 September 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," That Damned Ring
","RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving 'Fellowship' of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour. This three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there's a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there's not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you'll likely appreciate this installment more than me. There are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they're also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be. Another problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that's about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. 'Mythica: A Quest for Heroes' (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. Despite these negatives, 'The Two Towers' was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. GRADE: B-/C+",6,0,1,10 March 2018
The Mist," Good monsters, great ending, cartooney social commentary, truly thought-provoking
","THE STORY: A strange mist falls upon a Maine village where numerous townspeople hold up in a supermarket. Within the mist lurks strange insect-like creatures, big and small. Two groups slowly develop within the market: 1.) The sane group who just want to work together and survive and 2.) The increasingly-lunatic apocalypse mongers.Let me first address what doesn't work, and then we'll look at the film's many positives: WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The initial set-up of the story is fine until about the 35-minute mark when I started rolling my eyes at the character stereotypes and their unbelievable actions. For instance, Thomas Jane's black neighbor is ridiculously paranoid of imagined slights and it's just not believable.Then there's the clichéd self-righteous, hate-mongering, doomsday-obsessed 'Christian' played by Marcia Gay Harden. I'm not saying people like this wacko don't exist (after all, Jesus plainly stated 'There will be false prophets; you'll recognize them by their fruits'), it's just that she doesn't come off believable. She also lacks the charismatic flair necessary to convert half of the people to her lunatic fringe.These are just two examples; there are more cartooney stereotypes that tempted me to tune out, the worst being when the wacko group attempts to sacrifice a guy. It was dumb, but I persevered on the grounds that the people in the store are a microcosm of the American melting pot. Hence, most of the people are TYPES rather than realistic individuals.Another negative is that a full 90-minutes of the 2-hour runtime takes place IN the supermarket (or adjoining pharmacy), which gives the film a confined vibe. The good news is that the ending is truly worth the wait.WHAT WORKS: The explanation given for the mist and the creatures is surprisingly plausible.Some have criticized that all the characters are unlikable, but this simply isn't true. For instance, Thomas Jane is a good protagonist. All hell's literally breaking loose but he keeps his head at all times.There are numerous other likable characters like the beautiful Laurie Holden who plays the schoolteacher Amanda. Amanda is truly spiritual, full of love, mercy and compassion. She's the antithesis of the Pharisaical Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). For instance, Carmody goes on and on with her religious blather and Amanda simply responds, 'You're too Old Testament.' Amanda wouldn't say this unless she was familiar with the differences between the Old and New Testaments. This would indicate that she's likely a Christian of some sort, which is substantiated by her truly loving spirit (not that non-Christians can't be loving, just that agape love is the core fruit of the Christian faith, which is why Jesus taught that false prophets can be plainly recognized by their lack of this fruit ~ Matthew 7:15-23. Agape love is one-and-the-same as the 'fruit of the spirit' detailed in Galations 5). Why do I point this out? Because it's tempting for Christians to write off 'The Mist' due to the character of Mrs. Carmody, who doesn't paint Christianity in a very positive light, to say the least.But, again, Jesus said there would be people like this, and there ARE. They're counterfeits. Notice during Mrs. Carmody's solo prayer in the bathroom where she essentially boasts of herself to God, a definite Pharisaical trait. Amanda then enters the restroom, full of love and understanding. Carmody responds with venomous, horribly insulting words, a clear indication that she's not truly what she claims to be.I'm a Christian and am therefore in contact with believers all the time and I can honestly tell you that the majority of Christians don't even remotely resemble Mrs. Carmody. Most Christians in my social circles sincerely walk in love and try to serve God even while they're flawed human beings who have weaknesses and make mistakes. And, yet, there are some hateful legalistic zealots like Mrs. Carmody. One woman I know insists on being addressed as 'Apostle Harris' at all times, even though she's not an apostle in the remotest sense. She's got to be one of the most joyless, unkind, hostile people I've ever met (she once 'rebuked' me for not praying over a cupcake!!!), yet she masquerades as a supposed Christian leader. Nothing could be further from the truth. She's false, pure and simple.As noted above, the story starts to feel overly confined due to the one-dimensional setting, but the climax is truly worth the wait (NO SPOILERS). At about the 1 hour and 45 minute mark the film takes on a truly mysterious and awe-inspiring vibe as a handful of people escape into the foreboding mist. The score at this point becomes equal parts ominous, beautiful and otherworldly.The potent ending is controversial. Some hate it but it makes a powerful point: Never give up hope because you never know how close you are to the dawn.FINAL ANALYSIS: I highly recommend seeing 'The Mist.' Even though it recalls other horror films, it possesses its own uniqueness. Yes, some of the characterizations are cartooney and contrived, but -- again -- the characters are a microcosm of multicultural society. Besides the ending is incredible (even if you oppose one certain aspect) and the story truly is thought-provoking. It successfully provokes the viewer to ponder long afterwards. My wife and I had a nice long discussion on the various social/religious issues and other points. This is a sign of a very worthwhile picture despite its obvious dumb elements.GRADE: Borderline B+ or A-",8,1,3,28 October 2011
A Quiet Place," Decent horror flick, but the family members make too many exasperating blunders
","A family tries to survive on their farm in rural New York while blind indestructible creatures prowl the landscape. The creatures find prey based on sound so they have to be careful to be quiet at all times. Emily Blunt plays the pregnant mother and John Krasinski her husband (Krasinski also directs).'A Quiet Place' (2018) is a well-made horror flick that brings to mind 'Signs' (2002) with ferocious creatures that mix the xenomorphs of 'Alien/Aliens' with the extraterrestrials of 'War of the Worlds' (2005). They're basically a knock-off of the monster in 'Cloverfield' (2008), albeit the smaller size of the creatures in those previous flicks.While this movie gets a lot of praise in some circles, the constant mistakes of the family members gets frustrating and tiresome. I love the tone, however, as well as Emily Blunt and the sumptuous Hudson River-area locations.The film runs 1 hour, 30 minutes, and was shot in the state of New York, about 50-65 miles north of the Big Apple (Beacon, Pawling & New Paltz), except for Little Falls, which is another 110 miles northwest.GRADE: C+/B-",5,0,0,18 May 2020
Ghostbusters," Fun horror/fantasy comedy with Murray & Aykroyd (etc.) but a tad overrated
","Released in 1984 and directed by Ivan Reitman, 'Ghostbusters' chronicles events when three former parapsychology professors (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd & Harold Ramis) set up shop in Manhattan as a curious specter removal service. Annie Potts plays their secretary while Ernie Hudson hires on as one of the team. Sigourney Weaver appears as the wannabe girlfriend of one of the ghostbusters (Murray) while Rick Moranis plays her geeky neighbor down the hall. There's always been some confusion about ghosts: Are they the disembodied souls (life forces) of dead people stuck on this plane? Are they 'flashes from the past'? Or are they demons (aka fallen angels or evil spirits) deceiving people into thinking they're 'ghosts'? 'Ghostbusters' interestingly addresses all three, sort of, which I found interesting. It's an amusing horror comedy with a classic early 80's cast and soundtrack. The F/X are well-done for the time, although quaint today, which I suppose is part of the movie's charm. Yet I think the high ratings are largely due to nostalgia because I wasn't entertained nearly as much as I thought I'd be. 'Men in Black' (1997) took this prototype and arguably made a better film. Still, 'Ghostbusters' is a fun, iconic flick and certainly worth checking out if its attributes trip your trigger. The movie runs 105 minutes and was shot in New York City & Los Angeles with studio stuff done in Burbank, California. The script was written by Aykroyd & Ramis.

Coyote Ugly," Fun and snappy, but too predictable with little depth
","Released in 2000, 'Coyote Ugly' is a drama starring Piper Perabo as a singer/composer who leaves her home in nearby New Jersey with her dad (John Goodman) to try her hand at the music business in the big city. For money, she gets a gig at a nightclub hotspot where the female workers dance on top of the bar for entertainment, amongst other things, like dumping ice on customers now and then, spraying others with the soda gun and occasionally pouring liquor on the bar and setting it aflame (Why Sure!). Maria Bello plays the owner of the bar while Adam Garcia plays the girl's potential beau.Perabo plays a thoroughly winsome heroine and the movie's fun with a kinetic soundtrack (with, for example, 'Pour Some Sugar on Me' playing twice). After the first act though the movie never really takes off and the story becomes predictably bland, albeit still entertaining.While the movie wasn't a big hit, it was moderately successful at the box office and has become a semi-iconic film. A mere 2 years after its release I was in Las Vegas and there was an establishment called Coyote Ugly with an alluring woman dancing out front on a raised platform to draw in customers. That was my first exposure to 'Coyote Ugly' and I asked my brother-in-law about it; to which he informed me it was a movie. One of the problems with the film is that the girl dancing out front of that Vegas nightclub was far more fetching than any of the actresses dancing in the movie. The women simply aren't curvy enough to engender much fascination. Perabo is arguably the best, followed by blond cutie Izabella Miko, but Miko and the rest (e.g. Bridget Moynahan and Melanie Lynskey) seriously looked like they needed to gain about 15 lbs. at least. But, I suppose if you like women with the shape of 12 year-old boys you might appreciate this element more than me.Another problem is the emphasis on the nightclub lifestyle and the soused antics thereof. If bars are your thang then you'll probably favor this movie more than I did. Thankfully, the protagonists eschew the drunkard lifestyle and the movie's to be commended for this (the filmmakers obviously wanted to 'have their cake and eat it too').But those are minor quibbles. The biggest problem with 'Coyote Ugly,' beyond the story being predictable, is that there's no meat on the bones, so to speak. Take the subplot with the boyfriend and his big revelation scene; it was underwhelming and weakly executed, to say the least. Moreover, I just saw the movie last night and I can't even remember if the protagonist 'makes it' in the music business at the end. That's how forgettable the film is.A couple of years after the flick was released my wife asked a 9 year-old girl what her favorite movie was and she enthusiastically said 'Coyote Ugly!' That tells you something about the film's depth.The picture runs 100 minutes and was shot in South Amboy, New Jersey; Atlantic Beach, Long Island; New York City; and Tower Theatre & Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles.

Gran Torino," 'Dirty Harry 6: The Golden Years'
","Clint Eastwood stars as Korean War veteran and retired automaker Walt Kowalski, still living in the old Michigan neighborhood that's falling apart around him (which reminds me of my late grandfather in New Haven). Kowalski's wife has just passed away and he's as cantankerous as ever -- scowling and growling at everyone and everything, including his Hmong neighbors who hail from Laos. Something happens that warms his relations with this family and he slowly becomes closer to them than his own kids and grandchildren. He naturally takes on the father-figure role with the two Hmong teens, in particular mentoring Thao (Bee Vang) on how to be manly and productive. Unfortunately there's a brutal Asian gang that preys on the teens and serious tensions rise. A showdown is inevitable.If you can imagine Dirty Harry in the role as the Asian mentor in 'The Karate Kid' and the teen as Asian instead of white you'd have a pretty good idea of 'Gran Torino,' except that the violence is darker and there's profuse cussing throughout.'Gran Torino' is greatly entertaining throughout its runtime. Although it's a serious drama it's also consistently hilarious without being a comedy, if that makes any sense.Some describe Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) as racist but this isn't really so. His many racist remarks throughout the film are dispersed evenhanded across the board, whether the recipients are white, Asian, Black or Hispanic. I think he realizes we're all human beings and we all have our strengths and weaknesses, potential for good or bad, regardless of race. His sharp remarks are simply his way of breaking the ice with people and relating to them. He dishes it out but also takes it. I'm not saying it's right, just that it's the way he is. The fact that he isn't really racist is proved by the close relationship he develops with his Hmong neighbors -- closer than his own flesh and blood. Would a real racist be open to such a relationship? A lot of themes are addressed, including second chances -- it's never too late to make up for past mistakes even if you're almost 80 years old. Walt obviously failed to develop close relationships with his two sons but a new 'son' is thrown into his lap as if a gift from above. This time's he's intent on doing it right.I liked the way the 'generation gap' is blown to smithereens in the story. Walt and Thao aren't just father/son figures they're friends. I can't help but think of God and Moses (Exodus 33:11) and Jesus and his 'friends' (John 15:14-15), but I digress.I also liked how the film addresses blood v.s. spirit. The story shows that spirit is thicker than blood. I'm not saying blood relations aren't important but truly precious souls are able to see and walk beyond kin or race parameters. Despite his gruff exterior, Kowalski is such a soul, which explains why he is able to BE Thao's spiritual father and friend. Blood doesn't prevent him from discerning his granddaughter as the spoiled brat she is and seeing Thao's humility and goodness despite his mistakes.There are many other important themes -- love, courage, sacrifice and redemption.Lastly, 'Gran Torino' addresses some of the same issues as 'Crash' but does it more effectively, not to mention humorously.GRADE: A",9,0,2,10 March 2014
The Longest Day," The Allies invade France while Hitler sleeps
","RELEASED IN 1962 and directed by several directors, 'The Longest Day' chronicles the Normandy invasion by the Allies on June 6, 1944, known as D-Day when American, British and Canadian forces boldly landed on five beaches over a fifty-mile stretch.What's interesting about this classic war flick is that they used Americans to play Americans, Brits to play Brits, Germans to play Germans and French to play French. In addition, each of the segments was shot by five different directors, including the parachuting episodes.The all-star cast includes luminaries like John Wayne, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, Robert Ryan, Eddie Albert, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Sean Connery, Jeffrey Hunter, Steve Forrest and Roddy McDowall. Furthermore, the opening military percussion-oriented score is superlative. The movie saves the compelling invasion of the Normandy beaches for the last act (unlike the mawkish 'Saving Private Ryan,' which starts with it).Unfortunately, the movie loses points for the B&W photography, which is inexplicable for such an all-star early 60's blockbuster. There are also some hackneyed or awkward parts, like the scene where a ravishing French woman & her bicycle suddenly appear at the railroad tracks by two skeptical German soldiers. Why Sure! Another arguable problem is that the ambitious scope of the film prevents the story from focusing on any one group of notable characters, which make the proceedings seem like a thrilling docudrama rather than a gripping action/drama.Nonetheless, 'The Longest Day' is a must to catch a glimpse of what it was like on D-Day on several fronts, not to mention you get to see the proverbial big picture.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 minutes shy of 3 hours; and was shot in France.

X-Men: Apocalypse," Ranks with the best in the X-Men franchise
","Released in 2016 and directed/co-written by Bryan Singer, 'X-Men: Apocalypse' has the team go up against the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), whose origins date back to ancient Egypt. After thousands of years in stasis, Apocalypse is immediately disillusioned by the state of the world and so recruits a team of worthy mutants, including a dispirited Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to purge humanity and craft a new world order over which he will reign. Professor X (James McAvoy), with the assistance of Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), leads a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction. Josh Helman is on hand as Col. Stryker.This sixth film in the franchise (not including the several spin off films) easily ranks as one of the best. It includes many of the best elements of the X-Men and everything I would want in a great X-Men flick:Professor X's ongoing goal for an educational sanctuary for interesting mutants from all over the world; his love for Moira (Rose Byrne); Magneto's increasing mastery of his great powers and his struggle to go on the offensive against prejudiced humanity; a greater focus on Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and his potent power, both of which were neglected in the original trilogy; an outstanding actress to play Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), who is far better than the bland Famke Janssen; Olivia Munn's ultra-hotness as Psylocke; a worthy subplot on Weapon X with the corresponding guest appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); an excellent collection of young mutants, like Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Havok (Lucas Till), Angel (Ben Hardy), etc.; a worthy main villain in the mold of Dr. Doom and Thanatos; an epic, apocalyptic final act (sorry); I could go on and on.This isn't to say the movie doesn't have faults, however; the cartoony overblown prologue in ancient Egypt is Exhibit A.The film runs 144 minutes and was shot in Quebec, Canada (Greenfield Park, Montreal and Oka).GRADE: A-",8,0,0,9 April 2017
Meet Joe Black," Captivating commentary on love, life and death
","The Grim Reaper (i.e. the Angel of Death) comes to take billionaire industrialist Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) but instead decides to take a holiday in the corporeal universe by possessing the body of a young man (Brad Pitt). Death's deal with Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death materializes as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His 'holiday' is complicated when he falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).'Meet Joe Black' (1998) is a re-imagining of the 1934 film 'Death Takes a Holiday' (which I've never seen). It has the confidence to take its time at almost 3 hours, but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good 'fish out of water' stories like Spock in Star Trek, 'Starman' (1984), etc.Yes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter touches. I would compare it to 'The Green Mile' (1999), another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.Despite its fantastical premise, 'Meet Joe Black' consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience - love, life, death and numerous others, e.g. betrayal, rivalry, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond. One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law (Jeffrey Tambor) offers a definition of love to Joe Black: To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay, presuming they're penitent. This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.'Meet Joe Black' cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office. Fortunately it has gone on to garner an enthusiastic following and rightly so 'cause this is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking and genuinely moving. I consider myself a masculine man, but tears flowed through approximately 1/3 of the runtime. This is a sign of a potent and affecting picture.It's a travesty that dreck like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' makes gazillions of dollars and garbage like 'American Beauty' are hailed as masterpieces while true gems like 'Joe Black' are often overlooked. The good thing is that time was on Joe Black's side. The word got out.The film runs 2 hours, 58 minutes, and was shot in Warwick, Rhode Island (Aldrich Mansion); Manhattan; and Teaneck, New Jersey.GRADE: A/A-",9,1,2,10 March 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Decent sequel with mature tone & listless story, but excellent (shocking) final act
","Released in 2014 and directed by Marc Webb, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' stars Andrew Garfield as the troubled, but likable hero with spider powers who struggles with relationship issues with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and battles Electro (Jamie Foxx), a humble electrical engineer transformed into a living electric generator. Dane DeHaan is also on hand as Harry Osborn, who has a startling transformation of his own. Sally Field plays Aunt May while Felicity Jones appears as Felicia.It's best to watch the first film before this one because some story elements transfer over. It features the same main cast and has the same tone, so if you liked that one you'll probably like this sequel. Thankfully, they fixed Spider-Man's costume, noticeably the mask & eyes. While I like the mature, sometimes reverential tone, the story feels listless, particularly the part revolving around Electro (which is thoroughly changed from the comics). Foxx is fine; I just found the character, as written, uninteresting. Ditto with the other convoluted subplot. DeHaan works better as the second villain (I'm not going to say who, but it's obvious if you know anything about Spider-Man).Thankfully, everything perks up in the final act where the creators do something bold. I didn't think they'd do it and found it almost shocking, although they didn't milk it for it's potential (but they did well enough). Even the Rhino shows up.The movie runs 142 minutes and was shot in New York (The City, Rochester & Long Island) and Los Angeles.

Back to the Future Part III," Marty & Doc visit the Old West
","Released in 1990, 'Back to the Future Part III' stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen who travels back to 1885 to save his friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Mary Steenburgen plays a woman that catches Doc's eye in the Old West while Lea Thompson plays a McFly ancestor. Thomas F. Wilson returns as the villain, both as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen and Biff, while Elisabeth Shue returns as Marty's girlfriend. There are also numerous Western icons featured in peripheral roles.On paper this should've been a great ending to the trilogy and I expected it to be. Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't take advantage of the great possibilities of Marty & Doc being in the Old West and the movie bogs down in the second act with several dull sequences. So it's definitely the least of the trilogy, but there's enough good here to make it worth catching for fans of the franchise. There are several amusing bits and the ending is worth waiting for.

Patton," 'Old Blood and Guts' valued courage and resolve above all
","RELEASED IN 1970 and directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, 'Patton' stars George C. Scott as the charismatic general during his WWII campaigns in North Africa and Sicily, as well as France & Germany following the Normandy invasion. After the invasion of Sicily, Patton was reprimanded for slapping a cowardly soldier suffering battle fatigue (in real life it was two soldiers on separate occasions in the course of eight days in August, 1943). The fiery general was removed from command for eleven months while his junior in age and rank, Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), was selected to command the First United States Army for the invasion of Normandy.Meanwhile, Patton was assigned to London as a decoy to deceive the Germans in a sham operation called Fortitude. The ruse was successful because the German High Command respected Patton more than any other Allied commander and deemed him crucial to any plan to invade mainland Europe. Immediately following the successful invasion, he was put in command of the Third Army in the final Allied thrust against Germany where the headstrong general, once again, proved his mettle as his forces favored speed and aggressive offensive action.Patton was an interesting character who maintained a flashy larger-than-life image in order to encourage his troops; and he didn't hesitate to get his hands dirty with them. While other officers tried to blend-in with the troops on the battlefield, Patton brazenly displayed his rank insignia. He was a romantic who valued bravery and tenacity above all. All this is effectively conveyed in this ambitious war flick. It's interesting to observe the North African and European theaters of the war from the standpoint of the Allied generals, mostly Patton and Bradley, rather than the typical perspective of the infantry.THE FILM WAS WRITTEN by Francis Ford Coppola with additional material from Edmund H. North (based on the factual accounts of Ladislas Farago & Omar N. Bradley).

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Solid set-up, but falls apart in the second half
","Released in 2007, 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' continues the adventures of the Fantastic Four with Reed (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue (Jessica Alba) getting married, but their wedding is interrupted by a literal herald of global destruction, the Silver Surfer (voiced by none other than Laurence Fishburne). Michael Chiklis, Chris Evans and Julian McMahon return as The Thing, the Human Torch and Dr. Doom respectively, not to mention Kerry Washington as Alicia Masters. Andre Braugher and Beau Garrett are on hand as General Hager and Capt. Frankie Raye.I've been a fan of the Fantastic Four since my childhood and felt that the 2005 movie was a very good set-up for the series despite fumbling the ball with Dr. Doom and a mediocre action climax. With the presence of the Silver Surfer and Galactus I was expecting a great sequel, but it was not to be. The first half is quite good, however, with the main cast comfortable in their roles and obviously having a good time. But something goes awry in the second half where the proceedings get dull. It's hard to pinpoint the problem, but clearly they needed to work some kinks out in the script. On the positive side, Dr. Doom is better portrayed than in the first film. Despite my criticisms, there's enough good here to give 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' a lukewarm 'thumbs up,' just don't expect greatness.The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in British Columbia, California, New York City, Germany (The Black Forest), China, Japan and Greenland.GRADE: B-",6,1,1,4 April 2016
Men in Black II," Fun sequel, but not as good as the first one
","Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith and Rip Torn return in this sequel about a secret government agency based in New York City that deals with extraterrestrial interactions on Earth.Like the original 1997 movie, 'Men in Black II' (2002) is amusing & thrilling in the first half, but loses its mojo a bit in the second half where some of the jokes fall flat. If you've seen the first film, there's no need to see this one; but, if you want more with slight variations, then check it out. It's the lesser movie, but it still fills the bill for when you're in the mood for fun & thrilling popcorn entertainment.On the female front, Linda Fiorentino is absent, replaced by Lara Flynn Boyle as the villain and Rosario Dawson as a pizzaria employee that catches Jay's eyes. Meanwhile, the stunning Paige Brooks appears in a couple of small scenes.The next two sequels are: Men in Black 3' (2012) and 'Men in Black: International' (2019); the latter is the only entry in the series (so far) without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.The film runs 1 hour, 28 minutes, and was shot in New York City & surrounding area (e.g. Fire Island for the Post Office scene), as well as Los Angeles/Culver City/Pasadena.GRADE: B-/C+",6,0,0,24 May 2020
Rules of Engagement," Quality war-drama, better than 'A Few Good Men'
","Released in 2000, 'Rules of Engagement' is about two Marine officers, Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hodge (Tommy Lee Jones), who have a relationship going back to Vietnam. Childers is charged with murder after leading a team to the Yemen embassy to save the Ambassador and his family during a violent 'demonstration' (more like an all-out attack) and calls on Hodge to defend him. To save face, the National Security Adviser (Bruce Greenwood) wants Childers to be the scapegoat at all costs, disregarding blatant evidence to the contrary. Can Hodge, an alcoholic and mediocre lawyer at best, save his buddy who once saved his life? Guy Pierce plays the prosecutor while Ben Kingsley & Anne Archer play the Ambassador and his wife.This is a war-drama by the maker of 1973's 'The Exorcist' and 1977's 'Sorcerer' similar in tone/plot to 1992's 'A Few Good Men.' I like 'Rules' better, despite some flaws (like being contrived). It may not have an iconic line like 'You can't handle the truth!' but it has quality combat action (which 'A Few' didn't have) and the story of the protagonists is just more compelling IMHO. The movie's effectiveness hinges on Jackson and Jones convincing us of their characters, their relationship and their crisis, which they easily do. Some critics have decried the film as 'racist' (naturally), but it's more like telling the awful truth with 2012's infamous Benghazigate scandal lending support. Director Friedkin said the movie's not anti-Arab, anti-Muslim and certainly not anti-Yemen, it's anti-terrorist. Bear in mind that the King of Morocco had to read and approve the script before the filmmakers could use Morocco for locations and nobody participating from the Arab side of things felt the film was anti-Arab.One critic complained about a peripheral character not resurfacing at the end, but why pan a story for NOT being predictable?The blurb at the end makes it seem like the movie was based on a true story, but it's not. It simply reveals what happens to the characters after the story ends so the viewers aren't left in the air.The movie runs 128 minutes and was shot in Morocco (substituting for Yemen), South Carolina (Vietnam), Virginia and Washington DC.GRADE: B+",7,1,3,17 September 2015
Kelly's Heroes," Amusing all-star WWII dramedy/action flick with Eastwood and Savalas
","Released in 1970 and directed by Brian G. Hutton, 'Kelly's Heroes' is a war dramedy starring Clint Eastwood as the title character who convinces Sgt. Big Joe (Telly Savalas) & his platoon and a free-spirited Sherman tank commander (Donald Sutherland) to spend their three-day leave on a gold heist at a French village. The events take place 12 weeks after the Normandy invasion.'Kelly's Heroes' was obviously inspired by 'What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?' from four years earlier. Carroll O'Connor even plays the same basic role, a general who mistakes the misdeeds of Allied soldiers as brave, selfless combat; and arrives on the scene to commend them. The picture miraculously combines zany comedy with serious war action and is highlighted by the fun, eccentric theme song 'Burning Bridges' by The Mike Curb Congregation. Of course the all-star cast is great with Sutherland standing out as Oddball. People complain that Oddball was anachronistic since he was a late-60's hippie type, but his crew resembled Gypsies and, besides, there are laid-back free-spirited types in every generation.While the film is overall superior to 'What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?' it's inferior in that it lacks a female cast member in the form of the jaw-dropping Giovanna Ralli. Actually, the film was slated to have a female role, but it was cut from the script prior to filming. The stunning Ingrid Pitt was cast, as she worked with Eastwood two years earlier in 'Where Eagles Dare.' Ingrid was virtually climbing on board the plane bound for the set in Yugoslavia when word came that her part was cut. The fools.The film is a little overlong at 144 minutes and should've been cut by about 15-20 minutes, but the compelling last hour makes up for the flabbiness.

Million Dollar Baby," Female 'Rocky' with a downbeat and contradictory close
","Released in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood, 'Million Dollar Baby' stars Eastwood as a cantankerous boxing trainer who owns a working class gym in Los Angeles, which is maintained by one of his former boxers, the narrator of the story (Morgan Freeman). A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she's too old at 32 and he 'doesn't train girls,' probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier. Eventually he begrudgingly agrees.The bulk of the film is basically a female version of 'Rocky' (1976), except that I prefer the potent drama in this one. The three main characters are well fleshed-out with an all-around reverent tone, not to mention an occasional bit of mild amusement. Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it's touching.The third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat. It departs from sports movie formula with a message that contradicts everything the first two acts pushed, which is inexplicable. Sure, I 'get' the point: A certain person basically sacrifices everything to do what's (supposedly) best for the situation and honor the will of a dearly loved soul. Nevertheless, it's a dark turn that leaves a sour taste because it refutes the positive message of the first two-thirds of the story.The film runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles.GRADE: B-/C+",6,1,3,19 December 2018

Meanwhile, gangsters who want the briefcase follow them with intent to kill (Mike Starr and Karen Duffy). Teri Garr and Charles Rocket are also on hand.I was hoping for a funny and entertaining flick in the manner of 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' and 'The Mask,' both released the same year as 'Dumb and Dumber,' but, unfortunately, 'Dumb and Dumber' just isn't that funny. There are a couple laugh-out-loud scenes, like the karate fight, but most of the jokes either fall flat or are so dumb they're not funny (and I'm speaking as one who likes dumb humor – GOOD dumb humor). Another thing that didn't appeal to me was the potty jokes, which also weren't funny. Thankfully, there are a few things that make the film worth checking out, like the camaraderie of the two protagonists, Holly's incredible beauty, the road-trip element and the great locations.The original film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Providence, Rhode Island; Pennsylvania; Nebraska; Utah; and Colorado.

Guardians of the Galaxy," 'The Avengers' of space
","The Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in 1969 and in various Marvel comics of the mid-70s, like The Defenders, before appearing as the main attraction in Marvel Premiere in 1976-77. The Guardians are like the Avengers (or Justice League) of space, a superhero team with a revolving door line-up.This popular 2014 film was based on the 2008 version of the team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). The movie details how these characters meet and become the Guardians of the Galaxy as they square off against Ronan (Lee Pace), Nebula (Karen Gillan) and the intimidating Thanos (Josh Brolin). Michael Rooker is also on hand as Yondu, the space redneck who kidnapped Peter Quill (Star-Lord) from earth when he was a boy.I'm only familiar with the 70's team, which included Star-Lord, Gamora and Drax, as well as the villains Thanatos and Ronan. It was fun seeing these characters come to life on the big screen. The movie combines elements of The Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars and is a thrilling blockbuster that's fun, but probably too goofy at times for people who prefer the dead seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy. As far as galaxy-traveling superheroes go, I prefer the more-serious-albeit-still-amusing tone of 'Thor' and 'Thor 2.' Despite that cavil, I liked the way these independent, misfit anti-heroes slowly learn to gel as a team and even care for each other as the story progresses. Their initial selfish goals morph into a noble universal cause. Gamora is my favorite character, followed by Drax, Rocket and Groot.

The Evil Dead," Low-budget cult horror classic has a great first half, but a redundant second half
","RELEASED IN 1981 (but not until April, 1983, in the USA) and written & directed by Sam Raimi, 'The Evil Dead' chronicles events when five Michigan State students travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. Havoc ensues. This is a cult classic movie and the famous director's first full-length feature. It only cost $350,000 to make and was shot in 1979, as well as the first weeks of 1980. Bruce Campbell makes for a quality protagonist and there's a good trio of girl-next-door types (Ellen Sandweiss, Theresa Tilly and Betsy Baker), but Raimi only really takes advantage of these feminine resources with Sandweiss as Cheryl. The first half of the movie is great, which involves the five students' arrival to the cabin and the initial possession/attack sequences. It's atmospheric, well executed and compelling. The second half, however, is redundant. While each new attack ups the ante it's basically more of the same in the same setting (the cabin). Don't get me wrong, the second half is effective chaotic & chilling horror with loads of cartoony gore, but it's too one-dimensional with no meaty subtext to chew on. It's just people being attacked by hideous creatures, one after the other. This simplistic approach CAN work, as witnessed by 1972's 'Gargoyles,' but in that movie the initial gargoyle attacks led to a captivating confrontation in their hellish cave complex in the last act. The latter half of 'The Evil Dead,' by contrast, is just one attack after another in the same general setting. This might work for 11-14 year-olds who are wowed by cartoonish gore and constant diabolic thrills, but it doesn't work for more mature people who require some element of mindfood or, at least, variation to keep interested. Another negative is the final gory sequence which is decidedly low-budget and cartoony, albeit creatively and expertly done on a film student level.

The Piano," A girlie romance (that I don't really like), but outstanding
","I'm going to do something that I don't usually do and give a 'thumbs up' to 1993's 'The Piano' even though I don't particularly like major aspects of the story. Why? Because everything else about the film is exceptional on every level -- the beautiful dense forest cinematography of New Zealand's North Island, the realism of the Maori and the 1850's colony, the beautiful piano score, the great acting, etc.THE PLOT: A mute Scottish woman, Ada (Holly Hunter), and her daughter (Anna Paquin) go to a New Zealand plantation to meet her husband, Stewart (Sam Neill), an arranged marriage. Ada is slowly seduced by a gruff worker on the plantation, George Baines (Harvey Keitel), as she gives him piano lessons.The story is Exhibit A on why arranged marriages aren't a good idea. After all, how can you be 'one flesh' with someone for the rest of your life if you don't even like him/her or find him/her attractive? This is an adult historical drama with inoffensive, but overt nudity and adult themes, like control, sexual repression, sexual growth and the search for true love. Even though this is a girlie romance movie and I find elements of the drama dreadfully boring -- like Stewart's final confrontation with Baines (where you can barely make out the dialogue) -- the film makes up for it in every other department. It's in the realm of overall atmosphere -- the realistic, awesome, beautiful and harsh ambiance of 1850's New Zealand -- that the movie shines.The film was shot on location in New Zealand and runs 121 minutes.GRADE: B",7,0,2,1 July 2014

","Released in late 1996 and directed by Robert Rodriguez from Quentin Tarantino's script, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a crime thriller/horror film starring George Clooney and Tarantino as two violent thugs in Texas who take hostage a disillusioned ex-minister (Harvey Keitel) and his son & daughter (Ernest Liu & Juliette Lewis). Hiding in their RV, they escape into Mexico where they stop at a desert strip joint in order to rendezvous with their contact in the morning (Cheech Marin). Unexpectedly, the bar preys upon its patrons.Mixing 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) with 'The Lost Boys' (1987) and 'The Evil Dead' (1981), 'From Dusk Till Dawn' pulsates with hip energy and flair. Clooney shines in his first feature film as the antagonist-turned-protagonist. Salma Hayek's dance routine is jaw-dropping and iconic. The movie blends weighty spirituality with extreme irreverence, violence, gore and comic booky evil for a highly entertaining flick. It's not scary at all; but it's fun and thrilling, with thoughtful dialog.ADDITIONAL CAST: Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Danny Trejo, Michael Parks, John Saxon and Kelly Preston.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Barstow, Lancaster and Los Angeles, California; Chihuahua, Mexico; Redmond and Seattle, Washington.GRADE: A-",8,0,1,2 March 2017
Jurassic World," Been there done that (and better too)
","I was interested in seeing 'Jurassic World' (2015) because (1.) I love dinosaurs, (2.) I love island adventure and (3.) it's the third top-grossing film in cinematic history, as of this writing. I thought that it would be at least be as good as the first movie (1993), which – contrary to popular opinion -- I never felt was great because the story and characters were never that compelling. Yes, the dinosaurs were great and the t-rex and velociraptor sequences are exceptional, but most of the rest of the movie was average at best, even forgettable, although Sam Neill, Jeff Goldblum and Ariana Richards were effective. Despite my criticisms, I gave the film a solid grade of 'B' or 7/10 Stars.The second film (1997) and the third film (2001) were serviceable, but forgettable and somehow a letdown, which brings us to this fourth film in the series, a whopping fourteen years after the previous sequel. So how does it stack up? While 'Jurassic World' is better than the two previous movies it's not as good as the first one. In fact, the plot's pretty much a retread with marginal changes. The big difference here is that it's 22 years later and the original Park is now a Disneyworld-like tourist attraction called Jurassic World owned by Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and ran by an all-business woman named Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). Chris Pratt plays the male protagonist, Vincent D'Onofrio the bad guy, Omar Sy the token black dude and BD Wong the token Asian scientist. Katie McGrath is on hand as the boy's hired quasi-nanny at the park, Zara, but she's not fleshed-out as a character; flesh-eaten maybe, but not fleshed out.Actually, that's the main problem with this movie. The characters have little depth, although Bryce shines as the preoccupied-with-work Aunt and Pratt has the gravitas for his role. Unfortunately, the two kids (brothers) are decidedly dull. My wife thought so as well, so it's not just me. The writers should've worked-in the older brother's girlfriend to spice things up or, at least, some other girl at the park.Nevertheless, there are a few effective sequences or concepts, like the Pterosaur attack on the tourists, the rousing Indominus/t-rex fight and the earlier revelation about the former.The movie runs 126 minutes and was shot mainly in Hawaii, but also California and Louisiana.GRADE: B-",6,7,17,23 August 2015
Silence," Great filmmaking, cast and locations, but strangely inert (overlong) story
","Released in late 2016 and directed by Martin Scorsese based on the novel by Shûsaku Endô, 'Silence' chronicles events in 1640 when two Jesuit priests (Andrew Garfield & Adam Driver) journey to Japan to check on the persecuted church and find out what happened to their mentor, whom it is rumored fell from the faith (Liam Neeson). Issei Ogata is on hand as the sadistic, but seemingly reasonable Japanese inquisitor.The Jesuits were a society of Catholic missionaries started in 1540 in response to the spreading evangelism of the Protestant reformers. They were an essential part of the Roman counter-Reformation. With this in mind, the seeming Christianity portrayed in the movie is decidedly Catholic in nature, with the requisite unbiblical stuff, like confessions to priests, icons, rosary beads, etc.In tone and theme, 'Silence' is reminiscent of movies like the excellent 'Black Robe' (1991), the solid 'The Mission' (1986) and the surprisingly great 'Black Death' (see my review). There are also elements of 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957). If you appreciate any of these films you might appreciate 'Silence,' but it didn't work for me. Sure, Scorsese is a great auteur and so the filmmaking is top-of-the-line – the cinematography, the cast, the costuming, locations and score. Unfortunately, the story's not compelling and I never connected with the main character, despite Garfield's quality performance.There's some worthy mindfood (or spiritfood) to glean from the proceedings, however, like: Why does God allow the excruciating persecution of His faithful? Why is He silent? IS He silent? Can a believer be restored after cowardly denying the Lord in the face of torture/death? Can a Christian hide their faith while living in a thoroughly hostile culture? But I didn't buy for a second that the Japanese couldn't conceive of a Deity that transcends physical nature, like the sun, sea or mountain. While the idea may have been alien to their communal mindset at the time, it's absurd to think that no individual man or woman could discern the obvious (see Psalm 19:1 & Romans 1:20).Although I'm sorta glad I saw it, 'Silence' is curiously dull and overlong; and so I never care to see it again. There are far superior movies that tackle similar topics. Those who give it the highest possible rating must be fanatical devotees of Scorsese.The movie runs 161 minutes and was shot in Taiwan and the Cathedral Of Saint Paul In Macau, China.GRADE: C-",4,1,2,9 April 2017
Logan," Quasi-'superhero' movie focusing on the grim reality behind the comic book
","Released in 2017 and directed by James Mangold, 'Logan' takes place in 2029 when loner Logan, aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), is a weary Uber driver near the border in West Texas. No new mutant has been birthed for 25 years and Wolvie lives with the Alzheimer's-suffering Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and the albino mutant-tracking Caliban (Stephen Merchant) in an abandoned smelting plant across the border. After a mysterious new mutant girl enters the picture (Dafne Keen), Logan, Xavier and the lass flee for possible sanctuary in North Dakota hounded by a malevolent security team from the dubious corporation in which the girl originated. Donald Pierce plays the arrogant cybernetics-enhanced chief of security.This is the third and arguably the best Wolverine movie, although I slightly prefer 2009's underrated 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' (2013's 'Wolverine' was okay, but overall meh). 'Logan' focuses on aging & death contrasted by new birth and the potential thereof. For a superhero flick, it's gritty realistic with compelling drama & characters and an entertaining road trip, not to mention loads of hard R-rated violence. The movie explores the possibilities of what would happen when high-powered mutants become aged and diseased.Some of classic Marvel Comics' best moments were when one of their superheroes, e.g. The Thing or The Black Panther, was thrust into an everyday scenario, like talking to regular folks on the street or shopping at the market. There's a lot of this in 'Logan.' It dares to slow things down and focus on the characters and is the better for it. One of the best extended sequences is the trio's meeting with a hospitable black family (Eriq La Salle, Elise Neal & Quincy Fouse) after a highway mishap somewhere north of Oklahoma City. This episode is Exhibit A in why 'superheroes' can't mix with regular folk for too long, for their own welfare.'Logan' ranks with the best superhero movies because, like 2009's 'Watchmen,' it dares to be different. It's anything BUT a conventional superhero flick. Unfortunately, it's overlong at 141 minutes. The movie should've ended shortly after the trio's arrival to their destination, with some kind of potent dramatic close. But the filmmakers insisted on tacking on yet ANOTHER action-packed attack by the antagonists and it therefore ends on a tedious, redundant note. Disregarding this caveat, 'Logan' is a great 'superhero' flick.My favorite mutant, by the way, is the chubby black boy.The film was shot in Rio Rancho, New Mexico; Newhall, California; and Pauls Valley & Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The screenplay was written by director Mangold, Scott Frank & Michael Green.GRADE: A-",8,5,13,22 April 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Quality Superhero team flick, actually better than the first one
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015) is a quality superhero team movie. The first movie (2012) was so over-hyped that it was almost impossible NOT to be let down a little. It started good, but the set-up went on & on and wasn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time was spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which created a somewhat one-dimensional vibe; lastly, although Loki was a worthy villain, his army of Chitauri were stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who were basically just canon-fodder for the Avengers.I like this one better because the 'origin' element is out of the way and the setting isn't one-dimensional. There are numerous locations (England, Seoul, Bangladesh, South Africa and Italy), and additional characters like Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Ultron (voiced by James Spader) makes a worthy villain and the over-the-top action sequences are balanced out by quality character bits, like the Black Widow/Hulk/Banner relationship. Furthermore, the third act delivers with the requisite earth-threatening crisis.When I heard Olsen was going to play Scarlet Witch a couple of years ago I was disappointed because she definitely didn't have the curves to pull-off a woman like Scarlet Witch, but she obviously gained weight for the role and looks great. She has a striking face and is quite a convincing actress. Taylor-Johnson is fine as Quicksilver, but I can't help wondering why they didn't use Evan Peters, who played the character in 2014's 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' There are so many quality superhero movies at this point that a new one is pretty much just more of the same. So 'Avengers 2' creates a bit of a 'been-there-done-that' vibe, but it's well done for what it is. What makes me grant it a fairly high rating, besides the positives already noted, are a couple of moving parts, the subplot about Thor's hammer and the revelation of another character in the third act that I wasn't expecting, which elicits a 'Wow' reaction if you're familiar with the comic and even more so when you observe the tie-in to the aforementioned hammer.Lastly, there's a lot to take in with 'Avengers 2,' which makes it worthy of repeat viewings.The film runs 141 minutes.GRADE: A-",8,2,6,2 August 2015
Annie Hall," Talky romcom with Woody Allen and Diane Keaton is consistently amusing
","A twice-divorced neurotic stand-up comedian in New York City (Woody Allen) details his perspective on life and his relationship with the scatterbrained Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).The best movie I've seen by Woody Allen is the excellent 'Match Point' (2005), but that was a crime drama/romance/thriller whereas a lot of his films are talky romantic dramedies, which is the case with 'Annie Hall' (1977), winner of Best Picture and other awards at the AA. Was it worthy of all the accolades and does it hold up? Well, I laughed consistently if that tells you anything.The movie uses techniques that were probably innovative when it was released in 1977, like Annie's immaterial essence doing something else why her body's in bed with Alvy (Allen). The dialogue-driven approach is refreshing (today, that is) and the way Alvy sometimes breaks the fourth wall is amusing. I also enjoyed seeing the mid-70s period in the background, like 'Messiah of Evil' (1973) on the marquee and a billboard featuring DESTROYER-era KISS.The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in New York City & Long Island and the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B",7,1,1,17 February 2019
Blood Diamond," Man, I'm glad I live in America!
","Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond' (2006) takes place in the late 90s during the Sierra Leone Civil War between government soldiers and rebel forces. The title refers to diamonds mined in African war zones and sold to finance conflicts, thereby profiting warlords and diamond companies worldwide. The film depicts many of the atrocities of this war, including the rebels' amputating people's hands to discourage them from voting in upcoming elections (!). Yes, this is shocking, but as the characters say in the movie: TIA. That is, 'This is Africa.' The story involves Rhodesian Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a man with a haunted past who has made himself a key player in the business of conflict diamonds. Amidst the extreme political unrest he meets the beautiful Maddy (Jennifer Connelley), an American journalist who actually cares about what's happening, and Solomon (Djimon Hounsou), an honest African fisherman whose son has been taken by the rebels to be brainwashed and fight for their cause. Archer's sole interest in Solomon is that the fisherman knows were a huge blood diamond is buried, which could be Archer's ticket out of Africa.I'll be perfectly honest with you, I didn't know anything about this civil war or 'blood diamonds' until seeing 'Blood Diamond,' so the film is successful just by being educational.Although the story takes place in Sierra Leone (coastal northwest Africa) the film was shot in Mozambique (coastal southeast Africa) and South Africa. Regardless, the locations and cinematography are excellent, as is the score.Although the story is only moderately engaging and moving, the acting by the principles is great. We are treated to an interesting moral conundrum with Archer. Will he selfishly steal the blood diamond or keep his word and split the profits with Solomon? Will he continue to justify his part in perpetuating the problem of blood diamonds or will he risk his life by unveiling what he knows so Maddy can get the news out? Dicaprio is notable in the role. But the best character, by far, is the undefiled Solomon; the film successfully makes the viewer cheer for him and his cause.The film runs 143 minutes.FINAL WORD: This is a solid political thriller and educational to boot.GRADE: B",7,0,0,29 March 2012

Tommy Lee Jones plays his senior partner, Rip Torn the head of the agency, Vincent D'Onofrio a possessed hick and Linda Fiorentino an attractive coronor.'Men in Black' (1997) is wildly amusing in the first half, but loses its energy a bit in the last act. Nevertheless, it fills the bill for when you're in the mood for fun & thrilling popcorn entertainment. It inspired three sequels as of this date: 'Men in Black II' (2002), 'Men in Black 3' (2012) and 'Men in Black: International' (2019) with the last one being the only movie in the series without Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.The film runs 1 hour, 38 minutes, and was shot in New York City & surrounding area (e.g. Jersey City), as well as Semi Valley, CA (the saucer crash sequence) and nearby Los Angeles/Culver City.GRADE: B-",6,0,0,24 May 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Inventive drama/romance with Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet and so much more
","A man (Jim Carrey) discovers that his babe (Kate Winslet) had her memory of their relationship removed via the medical procedures of an innovative company. He decides to get the surgery as well, but as the technicians (Mark Ruffalo & Elijah Wood) conduct the procedure he changes his mind! Can he escape with his memory intact and possibly save the relationship? Tom Wilkinson plays the doctor and Kirsten Dunst the secretary.'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' (2004) is a drama/sci-fi/romance hybrid that's so confusing during its first half that it fails to captivate (and is even annoying) but, if you persevere, everything starts making sense by the midpoint, ushering in an entertaining and insightful second half. The movie's depth naturally makes it improve on repeat viewings wherein it's more understandable as you put the pieces together.Viewers who complain that a certain person is too dramatic, selfish and high maintenance to put up with for more than a month didn't get the closing moral, which is both true and profound: Couples can (and should) realize the flaws of their mate, which they genuinely don't like, but it's 'Okay.' That's true love.There are also unexpected peripheral gems on unethical behavior in a supposedly professional environment, secret relationships, discarding unwanted skeletons, and more. Lastly, curvy, vivacious Winslet shines and it's nice to see Carrey in a serious role.The film runs 1 hour, 48 minutes, and was shot in the New York City area (Yonkers, Montauk, Mount Vernon, Manhattan and Brooklyn).GRADE: A-",8,0,0,20 November 2019
Taken," Kill 'Em All
","Released in the U.S. in January, 2009, 'Taken' is one kick-axx movie! In fact, it's the best I've seen in a long time.THE PLOT: Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose 17-year-old daughter is abducted by Albanian sex-slavers while vacationing in Paris. Neeson immediately flies to Paris and utilizes all his skills to find his daughter and mercilessly punish anyone involved in the sex-trade who gets in his way.'Taken' plays out like a James Bond flick but without the goofiness and boring parts. Once Neeson gets on the trail of the sex-slavers it's non-stop suspense and action until the end.What makes the film work so well is that, like Neeson's character in the story, the viewer is left totally outraged by the sex-slaver's abduction of his daughter; hence, you're passionately rooting for him throughout the rest of the flick.It's true that Neeson is a veritable one-man-army in the film but it's presented in such a way that the viewer is able to suspend disbelief. In other words, it SEEMS believable. More than that, you WANT it to be believable because you want him to get his daughter back and annihilate the scumbags. Besides, Neeson is realistically portrayed as a father ruthlessly driven and pulling no punches. He has the emotional edge and determination that the slavers lack. He's an unstoppable force pure and simple.The film addresses a scary subject -- the sex-slave trade. This really happens. I know of two beautiful young girls locally who have disappeared while vacationing abroad; one was in Cancun and the other in Africa. The parents and siblings are left devastated and scarred for life. What happened to the girls? No one knows, but the sex-slave trade is a very real possibility. Not to mention the Natalee Holloway case; Urine Van der Sloot confessed in an interview that he sold Natalee for $10,000 and a boat came and picked her up. This would explain why no remains have been found. Although he later retracked the statements the strong possibility remains that Natalee may have been sold into the sex-slave trade.The moral of 'Taken' is simple: Anyone involved in the sex-slave trade deserves nothing but instant and merciless obliteration from this plane of existence.Incidentally, I read Roger Ebert's review before seeing the film and he gave it a mediocre 2.5/4 Star rating. Nothing could be further from the truth. 'Taken' pulls you in and and takes you on an enthralling thrill ride throughout its runtime. Not to mention it's well made on every level. But let's remember that Ebert gave the overrated and pretentious 'No Country for Old Men' a perfect 4/4 rating. Unbelievable.The film was shot on location in France and runs a short-but-sweet hour and a half.GRADE: A",9,1,1,13 March 2014
The Mummy Returns," Bigger is NOT always better; here it's overKILL
","I'm a fan of the first movie from 1999 and was naturally looking forward to this 2001 sequel. I originally saw it at the theater with two friends; after about 10-15 minutes we were all bored by the bombardment of action and F/X. We just laid back in our seats in tedium for the remaining couple hours.It's a curious thing that too much action and F/X in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true; and 'The Mummy Returns' is Exhibit A. I usually give certain movies second and third chances in the hope that my first impression may have been in error, which I've done with this one over the years. Unfortunately I keep finding myself relatively detached from the story even though there are all kinds of exciting things going on; or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.'The Mummy Returns' has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. (although some of the CGI is woefully cartoony, like the Scorpion King at the close). It has great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a forgettable piece of cinematic dung. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. 'The Mummy Returns' abandons the characters while the plot is utilized as a clothesline for action and F/X sequences.The flick curiously has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails to absorb the viewer. It is unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance or overKILL: having all the right elements, including budget, and yet stupefyingly fumbling the ball.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes (overlong), and was shot in England, Morocco, Jordan and Egypt.GRADE: C-",4,0,1,11 March 2014
Grindhouse," Zombies, dancing skanks, rednecks and killer stunt cars
","'Grindhouse' (2007) features two separate movies: 'Planet Terror' by Robert Rodriguez and 'Death Proof' by Quentin Tarantino. Together, they're called 'Grindhouse' because they're a deliberate attempt to recreate the experience of a double feature at a B movie house in the mid/late 60s-70s with the prints intentionally marred by scratches and blemishes or, in one case, a whole reel supposedly missing. Trailers for fake movies, like 'Machete,' are also part of the package.'Planet Terror' involves a biochemical outbreak in central Texas that (big surprise) turns people into zombies and the ragtag group that teams-up to fight 'em, led by Freddy Rodríguez and Michael Biehn, the latter a sheriff. Hotties Rose McGowan and Marley Shelton are on hand, the former acquiring a machine gun implant in replace of her amputated leg. (How exactly she pulls the trigger to massacre zombies is anyone's guess).The movie comes across as a melding of 'Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!' (1965), 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968) and 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978), but with the modern tone of 'Slither' (2006) with its gross, deliberately offensive black humor. McGowan is a highlight throughout, especially her opening go-go sequence whereas Freddy Rodriguez is surprisingly formidable. Their romantic arc is kind of touching. Another point of interest is the quality cast, rounded out by the likes of Bruce Willis, Josh Brolin, Naveen Andrews and Fergie. At the end of the day, though, 'Planet Terror' fails to rise above the low-budget sorta-genius of Syfy schlock like 'Flu Bird Horror' (2008), 'Wyvern' (2009) and 'Sasquatch Mountain' (2006) even though it cost literally twelve times as much. GRADE: C.'Death Proof' involves an embittered stuntman (Kurt Russell) and his psycho obsession with murdering young women of dubious character with his death proof stunt car (but only the driver's side). The first half is very good, hindered only by the inane chatter of the girls. This kind of dull drivel goes into overdrive in the second half, particularly involving Zoe Bell, Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson, but is rewarded by a thrilling car chase in the country that's supposedly Tennessee, but obviously Southern Cal.Russell's character is perversely charismatic and the movie perks up whenever he's on screen. There are no less than eight female co-stars playing mostly classless types (but not all of them) and, depending on your tastes, four of them are quite alluring,: Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito and Sydney Tamiia Poitier (yes, Sidney's daughter). GRADE: C+/B-.The two movies and additional trailers run 3 hours, 11 minutes. Unless you have that kind of time to blow, I suggest watching the movies singularly.OVERALL GRADE: C+",5,0,2,14 October 2018
The Last Samurai," Likable, but Lacks Originality
","'The Last Samurai' is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinematography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from 'Dances With Wolves,' a very superior film. One could also cite 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Last of the Dogmen' as films with similar plots. (Although 'Dogmen' is basically a rip-off of 'Dances With Wolves,' the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in 'Samurai' where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in 'Dogmen' wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from 'The Last of the Mohicans.' BOTTOM LINE: Although 'The Last Samurai' could be subtitled 'Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,' it's still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced 'Samurai' will likely rate 'The Last Samurai' higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP -- especially 'The Last of the Mohicans' and 'Dances With Wolves,' which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.GRADE: C+",5,1,2,12 March 2014
Where Eagles Dare," One of the greatest action/adventure films ever made
","RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Brian G. Hutton, 'Where Eagles Dare' is a World War II adventure about handful of commandos parachuting into the wilderness surrounding a German castle-fortress high in the Bavarian Alps. Their mission is to rescue a captive general before the Germans can interrogate him. However, not everything is as it first appears.The film is not a conventional World War II flick. Alistair Maclean wrote the script based on his novel and thus the movie is, unsurprisingly, a spy thriller just as much as it is a war picture. Keep in mind that spy flicks were super-hot when the film was released (e.g. James Bond). Are 60's spy films plausible? Realistic? No, they only have the veneer of plausibility and realism; underneath it's all escapist fantasy. So it is with 'Where Eagles Dare.'The opening with the breathtaking Alps and Ron Goodwin's exhilerating score is one of the greatest cinematic openings in history. From there you get intrigue, thrilling action scenes, a magnificent castle, Richard Burton at his charismatic best, two beautiful women (Mary Ure and Ingrid Pitt), surprising plot twists, cable cars, a suspenseful escape and a don't-see-it-coming ending, not to mention Clint Eastwood.Speaking of Eastwood, he plays a taciturn American lieutenant, second fiddle to Richard Burton, the British leader of the operation. Believe it or not, Burton's charisma is so out of the ball park that Eastwood pales by comparison. Of course, this has a lot to do with the way their roles were written, but you still have to give Burton credit for blowing Eastwood, who's no slouch, out of the water.Some complain about the utter ruthlessness of the Allied commandos, particularly the characters played by Burton and Eastwood, but they're Special Forces on a secret mission, not conventional soldiers in infantry combat. They're professional killing machines, which is why they were given the job. There was no room for mercy in this operation at this stage in the war.In any case, it's exciting to see Burton & Eastwood and their team mow down scores of Germans. The film's so well-done and compelling that you sorta don't realize how unbelievable it is while watching. This is because it lacks the cartoonish-ness of, say, 'Rambo 2' and 'Rambo 3' and maintains an air of realism throughout (which is different than saying it's realistic).FINAL WORD: 'Where Eagles Dare' is one of the greatest action/adventure films of all time and is as-good-or-better than any war flick you care to name. The exhilarating score itself is worth the price of admission, as is the opening. If you're in the mood for a World War II flick, 'Where Eagles Dare' is at the top of the list.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 35 minutes and was shot on location in Austria with studio work done in England.GRADE: A",10,2,8,15 March 2014
From Hell," From Alan Moore, the Hughes brothers and Johnny Depp
","RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by the Hughes brothers, 'From Hell' details the Jack the Ripper slayings in the slummy Whitechapel district of London in autumn, 1888. Johnny Depp plays an opium-addicted detective while Robbie Coltrane appears as his colleague. Heather Graham is on hand as a prostitute that captures the Detective's interest.The film was based on Alan Moore's graphic novel of the same name. Moore condemned the change of his 'gruff' version of Frederick Abberline with an 'absinthe-swilling dandy,' referring to the protagonist played by Depp. In real life, there's no evidence that Abberline 'chased the dragon' or that he had 'psychic visions.' Speaking of real life, Moore's graphic novel was based in large part on the royal conspiracy theory popularized in Stephen Knight's 1976 book 'Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution.' This is one of several theories on the identity of the slayer. True or (probably) not, it makes for a good story.'From Hell' plays like a Hammer film, but with a blockbuster budget in the modern era. A couple of comparable Hammer flicks are 'Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed' (1969) and 'Taste the Blood of Dracula' (1970). 'From Hell' even shares a minor subplot with the latter (high society 'gentlemen' in the Victorian era secretly partaking of taboo hedonistic pleasures). Like Hammer's Gothic horror catalog, you can expect top hats & black coats, cobblestone streets, alluring women, a ghastly killer (or monster) and lush colors.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 2 minutes and was shot in Prague, Czech Republic, and England (Boscastle & Goldings).GRADE: B",7,1,1,15 May 2018
National Treasure," Modern 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' in America
","If you can imagine a 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'-type story taking place in modern America, you'd have a fairly good idea of what 'National Treasure' is like. Nicolas Cage plays the Indiana Jones-type treasure hunter, Benjamin Franklin Gates, accompanied by his partner (Justin Bartha) and romantic interest (Diane Kruger), the latter a historical document scholar who gets dragged into the wild proceedings.THE PLOT: Gates feels he has no choice but to audaciously steal the Declaration of Independence to save it from his nemesis (Sean Bean). The document has an invisible clue on its flip side, which supposedly leads to a vast, coveted 'national treasure.' Can Gates successfully swipe the document, elude the Feds, and ultimately find the ancient fortune before his murderous, greedy rival? And can he simultaneously 'get the babe' as well? 'National Treasure' put a big grin on my face throughout its entire 2-hour run time. Like 1981's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' you're not supposed to dwell too deeply on the events because, if you do, the implausibilities will start to mount up. Nevertheless, even though this was made to be a fun, eminently entertaining ride, it still somehow stimulates ruminations and interest in American history. Not a bad by-product, no? A handful of miscellaneous items: Diane Kruger, who played 'the face that launched a thousand ships' in 2004's 'Troy,' is super sharp and all-around pleasant on the eyes.The score is modern with thrilling orchestrations intermingled with HEAVY progressive guitar riffs. It was composed by, believe it or not, Yes' guitarist/songwriter Trevor Rabin. Like 'Conan the Barbarian,' 'Last of the Mohicans' and 'Where Eagles Dare,' this is a soundtrack worth owning; it's that superlative.The protagonists are all likable; heck, even the head Fed, played by Harvey Keitel, is likable.The chases are thrilling.The film was shot on location in Washington D.C., Philadelphia and New York City.Jon Voight plays Gate's father.Like 'Raiders' this is a family-friendly experience -- upbeat with no needless cussing, sex or gore. The movie leaves you with a good feeling.CLOSING THOUGHT: Despite the fact that Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper gave it 'thumbs down' -- Roeper even calling it 'Howling, howling BAD' -- 'National Treasure' was a huge hit with audiences in 2004. This proves that critics like Roeper see WAY too many movies. They can't even lighten-up enough to enjoy a fun, thrilling, historically-stimulating popcorn flick. Implausible? Yes (at times, anyway). Bad? No.Make no mistake, 'National Treasure' is an entertaining quasi-believable adventure film. It's got the mojo.The movie runs 131 minutes. GRADE: B+ or A- (7.5/10 Stars)",7,1,1,14 March 2014
Reservoir Dogs," The cuss-oriented squabbles of lowlife crooks for 99 minutes (and no women)
","RELEASED IN 1992 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, 'Reservoir Dogs' is a crime drama/thriller about a diamond heist gone disastrously wrong in Los Angeles wherein the surviving thugs bicker back-and-forth in a warehouse about which of their members is a police informant. The main thieves are played by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn while Lawrence Tierney appears as the old salt mastermind.This was Tarantino's first feature film, costing only $1,200,000, and it has quirky glimmerings of future greatness, as seen in 'Pulp Fiction' (1994), 'Jackie Brown' (1997), 'Kill Bill' (2003/2004), 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009) and 'Django Unchained' (2012), but 'Reservoir' didn't work for me. It's hampered by a low-budget vibe, which I can handle, but not the uninteresting lowlife characters, their self-made conundrum, their interminably dull dialogue and the one-dimensional setting where about 80% of the story takes place in an old warehouse, not to mention no females in the main cast.Still, it's interesting to observe Tarantino's first serious stab at filmmaking and it has its moments of genuine entertainment. It's a lesson on humble beginnings, which shows potential while not being up to snuff.THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & Burbank.GRADE: C-",4,0,5,4 June 2018
The Great Raid," The most successful rescue mission in American history
","Released in 2005 and directed by John Dahl, 'The Great Raid' is a WWII war flick based on the real-life rescue of Allied POWs and civilians from a Japanese camp near Cabanatuan City in the Philippines. On January 30, 1945, the United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas saved more than 500 from the POW camp from ensuing death (the Japanese were ordered to 'liquidate' all prisoners before evacuating in the face of MacArthur's advance). Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Max Martini, Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen and Marton Csokas star.The rescue, along with the liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the POWs to share the truth about the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities. While the raid had no strategic value, as far as winning the war goes, it sparked a new wave of resolve in the war against Japan. Not to mention, it remains the most successful rescue mission in USA history.Although the movie was shot in 2002, it was pulled from release schedule on several occasions before finally having a limited released in August, 2005, with little-to-no marketing. Was it any wonder it failed to garner an audience and box office success? Be that as it may, this is a solid WWII flick based on a true story. The prisoners of the camp are the survivors of the infamous 60-mile Bataan Death March of April, 1942. The movie's not politically correct in that it shows the truth of the brutal savagery of the Japanese military. The actual raid doesn't take place until the 95-minute mark, but it's worth the wait; the build-up is informational and keeps your attention. While not great, this is a well-done and informative war flick. I'd watch it any day over 'Saving Private Ryan.'The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Bribie Island, Queensland, Australia, with the Manila sequences shot in Shanghai, China.

Pulp Fiction," The cream of the crop of quirky crime thrillers
","RELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) is a drama/thriller/black comedy about two hit men in Los Angeles (John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).The lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it's easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue's witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film's stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90's films and beyond.I put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with 'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let 'em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film's worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it's a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God's grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn't and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.Both Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can't go wrong with 'Pulp Fiction.' It's top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Roger Avary.GRADE: A",9,0,2,3 April 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Action-packed and amusing space fantasy with moments of depth and wonder
","RELEASED IN 2017 and directed & written by James Gunn, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' chronicles the Guardians meeting Star-Lord's father, Ego (Kurt Russell), and visiting his beautiful planet, which turns out to be (I'm not going to give it away). The Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in 1969 and in various Marvel comics of the mid-70s, like The Defenders, before appearing as the main attraction in Marvel Premiere in 1976-77. The Guardians are like the Avengers (or Justice League) of space, a superhero team with a revolving door line-up.The popular 2014 film and this sequel were based on the 2008 version of the team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot or, more specifically in this movie, Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Also returning are Gamora's vengeful sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), and Yondu (Michael Rooker), the space redneck who kidnapped Peter Quill (Star-Lord) from Earth when he was a boy. Elizabeth Debicki has a significant part as statuesque Ayesha, a haughty gold-skinned queen. The movie combines elements of The Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars and is a thrilling blockbuster that's fun, but probably too goofy at times for people who prefer the dead seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy. As far as galaxy-traveling superheroes go, I prefer the more-serious tone of 'Thor' and 'Thor 2.'Despite that cavil, the movie's entertaining as an amusing space fantasy blockbuster. It includes loads of action, character-defining parts, several classic rock staples and moments of wonder, not to mention the highlight (cuteness) of Baby Groot. A lot of elements come straight from Jim Starlin's Captain Marvel and Warlock comics from the 70s, not to mention Stan Lee & Jack Kirby's stuff from the 60s, albeit more goofy. THE MOVIE RUNS 136 minutes and was shot entirely in Georgia (Cartersville, Atlanta & Pinewood Atlanta Studios, Fayetteville). GRADE: B",7,1,3,1 September 2017
Titanic," All-around excellent accounting of the doomed ship
","The hype surrounding James Cameron's 'Titanic' when it was released during Christmas, 1997, and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way. Few films could live up to such ballyhoo. Nevertheless, viewing it apart from the mass hoopla, it shines in all-around greatness.The movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent Titanic from April 10-15, 1912. This is one of the greatest tragedies in human history. There were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men, women and children aboard. Why? Because the Titanic was so great they thought she was unsinkable. When it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold North Atlantic.This is a movie and not a documentary and, as such, includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer. This is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it. As far as I'm concerned, the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is excellent. Rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother (Frances Fisher) to marry the pompously rich Cal (Billy Zane). Jack, by contrast, is a dirt poor wandering artist who's free as the wind and brims with life, love, and humble honesty.Rose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob, no matter how handsome and wealthy. She's attracted to Jack because he's the antithesis of Cal. By contrast, her mother views Jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family. The 'Unsinkable' Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is another significant personality. She's new enough to 'high society' to still relate to the 'commoners' and so goes out of her way to help Jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy. Thrown into the mix is Cal's priceless diamond necklace for Rose and what happens to it.Speaking of which, there's a modern story (1996 anyway) that brackets the main plot. Bill Paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace, Suzy Amis as Rose's granddaughter and Gloria Stuart as old-aged Rose. Gloria was 85-86 years old during filming and she just shines in the role.The casting and acting is exceptional, particularly the main performers. It's no wonder that DiCaprio and Winslet went on to great success. In addition, the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificent.Yet it's the powerful subtext that inspires most. What good is great wealth without love, virtue, respect and freedom? In her untainted teenage idealism, Rose would rather die than have this. Jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and, therefore, possesses the former as well, even if you can't see it (if you know what I mean). Rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind. Some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle, but – remember – she grew-up with her life-stifling, greedy, fear-mongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard. Have some compassion! As for the fate of the necklace (***SPOILER***), Rose didn't cash-in on the diamond because she didn't want to rely on Cal for money; and she didn't give it to her granddaughter or the treasure-hunter because it wasn't hers to give. Since the insurance company paid out on the policy Cal's dad took out on it, the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found; it was no longer the property of Hockley or his heirs, and it wasn't the property of Rose either, because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest. She came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or, if that was not possible, to legal authorities. More importantly, the necklace was a reminder of her promise to Jack to 'Never let go.' She thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go, particularly since she finally returned to Jack's watery grave (***END SPOILER***).It wouldn't be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by James Horner and the theme song sung by Celine Dion. Great movies are great because their producers take the time & effort to achieve excellence on every level.Needless to say, because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciate 'Titanic.'GRADE: A",9,2,4,27 November 2014
Thor," More than just a superhero flick
","Released in 2011, 'Thor' is based on the long-running Marvel comic book. The comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms -- the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories.The film is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).THE PLOT (minor plot SPOILER): Odin the 'Allfather' is about to anoint Thor as the next king of Asgard, but his son displays folly, arrogance, disrespect and rebellion, forcing Odin to discipline him. Thor is stripped of his godhood and his incredible hammer, Mjolnir, and banished to the earth with no more power than any mortal his size. Thor encounters Jane Porter & her colleagues, as well as the US Government, in his quest for Mjolnir and redemption. Meanwhile his jealous brother Loki enacts schemes in Asgard, forcing the Warrior's Three and Sif to leave and find the exiled Thor. Loki sends The Destroyer to eliminate his brother, which also threatens the thunder god's new group of mortal friends.You couldn't ask for a better cast: Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Anthony Hopkins as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki and three total babes as Jane Porter, Jane's friend Darcy and Lady Sif -- Natalie Portman, Kat Dennings and Jaimie Alexander respectively. Some complain about the Asian and African actors in the roles of Hogun and Heimdall, but Hogun always seemed to be modeled after Mongol-types. And who says there aren't other races on Asgard anyway? The Norse encountered some Asgardians many centuries ago spurring their mythology, which naturally didn't include (then) far-off races, but who says the real Asgardians weren't racially diverse? Some criticize the film as campy because it deals with Norse mythology and the fact that the whole realm of Asgard can seem outlandish and cartooney. Yet the movie isn't about their mythology but about the actual Asgardians, who are very real in this story.'Thor' works so well because it's more than just a bunch mindless superhero mumbo jumbo and exciting action/CGI. The deep themes include the pitfalls of arrogance, juvenile rebellion, jealousy, rivalry and deceit, as well as the universal nobility of humility, repentance, courage and sacrificial love. Then there's the 'fish out of water' element of Thor exiled to earth and the curious things he does. On top of all this, we get a complex and interesting villain for a change. Sure the movie has a comic booky vibe, but that's what 'Thor' is based on. To dismiss it as a campy superhero flick is grossly inaccurate.The film runs 115 minutes and the Earth episodes were shot in New Mexico.The DVD features 4 deleted scenes, a 'Road to the Avengers' featurette, a director's commentary and a few trailers.FINAL WORD: I don't think you could ask for a better film adaption of the Thor comic and the thunder god's adventures in Asgard, Earth and elsewhere. The addition of the Destroyer is a plusGRADE: A-",8,3,6,28 September 2011
The Godfather: Part III," Michael Corleone seeks redemption while a young buck takes over the shady business
","RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, 'The Godfather: Part III' stars Al Pacino as aging Mafia don Michael Corleone in 1979, who seeks to legitimize his work in New York and Italy and avow for his sins. He mentors his bastard nephew, Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia), while trying to steer his teenage daughter, Mary, away from him (Sofia Coppola).MAIN CAST: Diane Keaton returns as Michael's ex-wife, Kay, while Talia Shire reprises the role of sister, Connie. Franc D'Ambrosio is on hand as Michael's son, Antonio, who wants to leave law school and become an opera singer. George Hamilton co-stars as B.J. Harrison, essentially taking the place of Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) as Michael's chief financial adviser and attorney. Eli Wallach plays an aged don and Joe Mantegna the gangster Michael put in charge of Little Italy after semi-retiring. Raf Vallone plays a dubious Cardinal and Bridget Fonda a fornicating reporter in a small role.Part III is on par with Part II in tone and quality, but I give this one the edge in overall entertainment value. Michael (Pacino) has much more human dimension here as opposed to his one-note grim depiction in Part II. His scenes confessing his sins to a priest in a Vatican City garden and, later, with Kay in Sicily are good examples. There are several other highlights amidst the drama, like the break-in scene at Vincent's abode, the Atlantic City massacre, the street festival hit, the entire closing opera sequence that juxtaposes the performances of the play with various violent attacks and the aftermath.Andy Garcia brings fresh blood and vitality to the trilogy in a pretty significant role, as does Sofia in a relatively small part. Winona Ryder was originally cast for the part, but she was too sick to perform and so Francis chose his daughter at the last minute and she's fine in the role. Does anyone seriously think Winona Ryder would have taken this peripheral part and done it any better? I heard all the ridiculous criticism over Sofia's performance before viewing the film and therefore kept waiting for a serious train wreck, but it never happened. She did a fine job for a side character who's an unseasoned, slightly self-conscious (i.e. wooden), flirty teen. To those sheeple who have joined the idiotic critical feeding frenzy: Shut the fudge up and get a life! The moral of the story rings loud and clear: Choosing the life of organized crime will result in a grim life of constant heartache and premature death all around you. Needless to say, Life's hard enough without taking that foolish route.Bottom line: This is a worthwhile crime drama with several highlights, but it doesn't rank up there with the first movie, which stands alone. If you're a fan of the first two films it's almost mandatory that you watch this one. It lacks the thrilling greatness of the first film, but it's about equal to the second, although I favor this one a little.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 42 minutes (or 2 hours 50 minutes, the longer version) and was shot in Sicily and numerous places on mainland Italy, including Vatican City; the New York City area; Atlantic City, NJ; and Lake Tahoe, California.

The Fountain," Aesthetically pleasing and spiritually rich, but not compelling
","Released in 2007, 'The Fountain' features three stories in its plot: The main story is that of a modern-day medical researcher, Tom (Hugh Jackman), trying to find a cure for cancer, which would save his dying wife, Izzy (Rachel Weisz). The other two stories involve a conquistador (also Jackman) in Mayan country trying to find a legendary 'tree of life,' and a bald space-traveler (Jackman again) in a bubble partaking from the 'tree of life' therein. Ellen Burstyn is on hand as Tom's superior in the medical facility.If you're familiar with director Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' (2000) then you know he's more interested in creating cinematic art than popcorn fodder for the masses. 'The Fountain' belongs in the former category and this makes it a hard film to critique. On the one hand, it's an aesthetically pleasing picture and very well made, but, on the other, it's simply not a compelling experience and therefore I'm not interested in viewing it again. The only way I was able to get through it was because I viewed it with my wife and we kept ourselves entertained.Keep in mind that I very much appreciate artistic films and enjoy trying to figure them out, etc. but the most important element of any movie is a compelling story and the corresponding interesting characters to hook the viewer for two hours or so. Without these it'll be a boring experience regardless of the beautiful and innovative images, music, sets, editing, F/X, etc. This is why I'll give a low-budget movie with weak sets and F/X a positive review if the story is effective and contains rich subtext. I'm sure a lot of thought was put into the script of 'The Fountain' and the subtext thereof – in fact, my INTERPRETATION below shows this – but at the end of the day the movie's a dull experience despite its awesome aesthetics. Moreover, the deeper elements – while well-intentioned – are more laughable than profound.Francis Ford Coppola is an artistic filmmaker like Aronofsky (and no doubt his mentor) and Coppola's 'Youth Without Youth' is cut from the same cloth as 'The Fountain,' not to mention released the same year. While it has the same problems as 'The Fountain' it works better because the story's more interesting and Coppola was sure to throw in some hooks for the viewer despite the film's thematic and aesthetic depth.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in Montreal, Canada, with an establishing shot of Philadelphia.GRADE: C- INTERPRETATION ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the movie): The conquistador story is fictional because it's Izzy's novel whereas the modern-day story is reality. As such, Izzy imagines the noble swordsman to be her husband (but with a different name) and herself as Queen Isabel. The spaceman story is Tom's final chapter of Izzy's book.",4,1,5,29 October 2015
Mystic River," Evils of the past and the problems with vigilante justice
","Released in 2003 and directed by Clint Eastwood, 'Mystic River' tells the story of three men from a working class neighborhood in Boston. While playing in the street as kids, one of them is abducted and sexually abused for days. As adults they've drifted apart. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a reformed con who runs a successful market when his daughter is suddenly murdered (Emmy Rossum). Sean (Kevin Bacon) investigates the murder with his partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), with evidence eventually pointing toward Dave (Timothy Bottoms), the one who was abducted. Marcia Gay Harden plays Dave's anxious spouse while Laura Linney plays Jimmy's loyal wife.This is similar in tone & theme to the melancholy 'Sleepers' (1996), but less episodic and more dramatically gripping. The movie has the confidence to take its time and flesh-out the characters. It's a psychological crime drama that works as both a whodunit and a tragedy. The intrinsic problems of vigilante justice are cogently illustrated.Some people have misinterpreted the movie because they missed some things. For instance, they criticize the curious Lady Macbeth-like monologue of Annabeth (Linney) at the end. But watch the movie again, pay close attention, and the answers are there. I'd say more, but I don't want to give anything away (you're welcome to write me if you'd like some insights).'Mystic River' is not something that can be casually watched; it's a deep drama with three-dimensional characters, potently exploring several intriguing issues: How abuses of the past affect the present; the danger of hiding recesses of your psyche; the folly of not getting spiritual help for deep-rooted psychological concerns; disloyalty/loyalty; doing the wrong thing for the right reasons; jumping to wrong conclusions based on dubious info; houses divided cannot stand; the importance of encouraging one's spouse for the sake of familial health & survival; 'king of the castle'; etc.The film runs 2 hours, 18 minutes and was shot in Boston.GRADE: A",9,0,0,17 December 2018
Enemy at the Gates," War of the rats in crumbling Stalingrad during WWII
","RELEASED IN 2001 and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud , 'Enemy at the Gates' takes place in the last four months of 1942 during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad. Russian troops are carted in by the literal trainloads as the Germans attack/bomb the city. Once the dust clears the situation settles into a more personal battle of sharpshooting wills. A lowly young Russian soldier named Vassili (Jude Law) distinguishes himself for his shooting skills and is promoted as a national hero to motivate the Russian cause. After numerous German officers are assassinated, Major König (Ed Harris), the top German sniper, is assigned to seek out and eliminate Vassili.Most WWII films take place on the Western Front whereas 'Enemy' is one of only two mainline films I can think of that address the Eastern front, the other being Sam Peckinpah's underrated 'Cross of Iron' (1977).Three things stuck in my mind after seeing 'Enemy at the Gates' years ago: (1.) The opening sequence where the Russian troops are boated across the Volga to join the fight is extremely harrowing, not far removed from the opening D-Day invasion in 'Saving Private Ryan' (1998), but different. 'Enemy' is worth viewing for this sequence alone. (2.) The city-in-rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurrying-like-rats-through-the-rubble warfare. (3.) Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet lovemaking scene while the soldiers lain in the rubble trying to sleep. I'm not sure why this left an impression, maybe because it struck me as so real: Men & women would be drawn to one another and mate even in the worst possible scenarios.The film was based on the book 'War of the Rats' by David L. Robbins and thus intentionally provokes the imagery of human rats scurrying through the debris. The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as the political officer who elevates Vassili to hero status via his pamphlets and articles, while Rachel Weisz plays the romantic interest between the two. Ron Perlman is also on hand in a limited role as Vassili's sharpshooting comrade.As with any film based on historical events there are facts-obsessed critics who decry the lack of authenticity in this or that detail (e.g. 'The zippers on the trousers aren't right, blasphemy!!'), but 'Enemy' gets the gist correct and, besides, it motivates the viewer to research the actual Battle of Stalingrad. What more can you ask for? The fact is Vassili had 260 verified Nazi kills and played a key role in motivating the Russians to victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, the largest and bloodiest battle in the history of warfare (with roughly 2 million killed, wounded or captured). The movie effectively shows how the Russian combatants weren't necessarily professionally trained soldiers; many of them were peasants, workers, teachers, mailmen, farmers, etc. They knew they could die the next morning hence they celebrated (and made love) while they could. Stalingrad was one of the major turning points of World War II; from then on it was all downhill for Germany.FINAL WORD: 'Enemy at the Gates' details an oft-ignored important aspect of WWII, the Eastern front. It has several memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 11 minutes and was shot entirely in Germany (Brandenburg and Bavaria).GRADE: B+",7,0,2,12 March 2014
Die Hard," Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and a skyscraper

In this one New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) flies to Los Angeles to spend Christmas with his wife & kids. When McClane visits Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at her company's Christmas party a group of radical criminals take control of the skyscraper. Alan Rickman plays the nefarious mastermind of the operation while Reginald VelJohnson plays a cop on the ground that befriends McClane via walkie talkie. Meanwhile Paul Gleason is on hand as an exasperating police chief.This franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean 'dumb' in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond 'genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.'The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's 'The Gauntlet' where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's 'The Mummy Returns.' Thankfully, 'Die Hard' evades that ditch because it's not too over-the-top and it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing one-liners, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.While all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because this one takes place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot entirely in Los Angeles.GRADE: B/B+",7,1,1,19 March 2019
Psycho," 'We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?'
","A Phoenix secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), embezzles $40,000 and rashly flees town, ending up at a remote motel in Fairvale, California, where she encounters the eccentric Mama's boy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and Marion's secret beau (John Gavin).Directed by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch's book, 'Psycho' made a huge impact when it was released in 1960. It contains a plot development that was groundbreaking at the time shared by England's 'City of the Dead' (aka 'Horror Hotel'), which went into production six weeks earlier than 'Psycho' and was released in the UK at the same time, but not in America until 2 years later. While they're both good, 'Psycho' is way superior. It was followed by three sequels (1983, 1986 and 1990), the last being a semi-prequel, all starring Anthony Perkins as Norman with Vera Miles returning for the first one.One thing I don't like is that it was shot in B&W. Check out the sequels and the 1998 remake to observe the same settings in living color.The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes and was shot primarily at the backlot of Universal Studios, Universal City, California, with other parts in Los Angeles & Gorman, California, and Phoenix, Arizona.

The Witch," Unsettling slow burn to hopeless perdition
","Released in 2015 and written/directed by Robert Eggers, 'The Witch' (aka 'The VVitch: A New-England Folktale') involves a devout family in the 17th century who leave a Puritan plantation due to theological differences and build a farm house in the New England wilderness. A string of tragedies offers evidence of a diabolical witch dwelling in the mysterious woods as the family descends into madness. Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie play the parents, William and Katherine, while Anya Taylor-Joy and Harvey Scrimshaw play the oldest of the five kids, Thomasin and Caleb.The film is based on Eggers' childhood fascination with witches. Much research was done, extensively working from records in English and American museums, as well as consulting 17th century agricultural experts. The labors of Eggers & his team can be observed in the film because it's thoroughly convincing, as far as sets, dialogue and acting go. Speaking of dialogue, I encourage you to utilize the subtitles because you'll only understand half of the Old English verbiage.'The Witch' is a mix of family drama, folktale and horror, coming across as a combo of four films: 'The Crucible' (1996), 'The Village' (2004), 'Blood on Satan's Claw' (1971) and the satanic ritual sequence of 'The Devil Rides Out' (ake 'The Devil's Bride) (1968). It's more supernatural and creepy than the first two, but if you like these four films you'll probably appreciate it. 'The Witch' brilliantly captures the paranoia & superstition of Puritan communities in New England around the time of the Salem witch trials of 1692-1693 and melds it with supernatural horror. Everything is interwoven into a macabre ode of a time & place where people imagined witches and devils dwelling in the dark woods except here they're for real.The family is a good loving family, but they're bound by the legalism of the strain of Calvinism they embrace. The father's proud, non-sectarian spirit cuts them off from the support of the only accessible community. By themselves in the black forest, they're open prey to the devil & his denizens. While the movie's admirable in so many ways, including the fact that it's ambiguous enough to be open to interpretation, it's also generally dull and too unpleasant for my tastes (yes, I realize it's SUPPOSED to be 'unpleasant' to a degree since it's a horror flick, but the third act just gets too ugly and leaves a bad taste). But Anya Taylor-Joy is magnificent and Ralph Ineson is excellent.The film runs 92 minutes and was shot in Kiosk, Ontario, Canada. Costing only $3.5 million, it made $40.5 million worldwide with $25 million from North America.GRADE: C+ ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (***SPOILER ALERT***) Some commentators absurdly suggest that Thomasin is better off at the end than living within the religious confines of her family or the Puritan community. Really? She now gets to slaughter babies in the woods and eventually face eternal damnation; yeah, that's just so incredibly liberating. Would she really be happy joining a bunch of murderous beasts, a couple of which just slaughtered her family? Interestingly, grinding babies to death is presumably female emancipation in this 'folktale' and that's not too far from reality in modern Western culture.Other commentators suggest that we don't know if what's going on is real or the result of mental illness due to extreme religiosity or a perhaps even a nightmare. ANSWER: Yes, we do know. From almost the very beginning we KNOW there's an actual diabolical witch in the area, which we SEE stole the baby and bathes in his blood. Shortly later we observe that this satanic ritual brings back her youth (or, at least, the appearance of youth); and she seduces Caleb, showing that she's a friggin' pedophile. The only thing we don't know is if there is more than one witch or what the devil's place in the events is or isn't, both of which are revealed literally in the final act.Furthermore, if the witch is a delusion of one or more of the family members then that means that Thomasin or one of the others took the baby; of perhaps an animal. So where's the body or remains and why weren't William & Caleb able to find it during their thorough searches? If one of them or an animal, like a wolf, took and killed the infant where's the evidence, where's the blood? We see zero evidence to draw this conclusion.Also keep in mind that the movie is subtitled a 'folktale' and is based on actual documents from the 17th century. In other words, the movie doesn't depict reality, but is exactly what it says it is -- a folk TALE where ugly, evil witches who bathe in infants' blood and devils who masquerade as goats really lurk in the dark woods and are to be feared. So the surmounting tragedies the family experiences aren't a product of hyper-religious paranoia or a nightmare, but rather the result of confrontation with sinister beings, both physical and spiritual, which exist in the 'world' of the movie.Lastly, the message of the film is obvious: Don't leave the strength and protection of the community of believers due to arrogance or you'll be picked off one by one by the Enemy; or, at least, seduced into joining the dark side.",5,13,23,13 November 2016
War of the Worlds," Good parts hampered by others that insult the viewer's intelligence
","Steven Spielberg's 2005 version of H.G. Well's 'War of the Worlds' tells the story of a divorced man (Tom Cruise) and his son & daughter facing a horrifying alien invasion of Earth. They attempt to travel from New York City to Boston, where the kids' mother lives.WHAT WORKS: Interestingly, I went to see this film at the theater with a friend who strongly reminded me of Cruise's character in the film. He's divorced, the kids live with the ex-wife, and he's the type of guy who would have a car engine on his kitchen table. Hence, the family scenario was very real to us.Speaking of real, the story is presented in a very realistic, serious manner. You don't have to worry about the goofiness and jingoistic elements that plagued 1996's 'Independence Day' (I can't stand that film).What works best are the towering and utterly horrifying alien tripods. They skulk around on their long massive legs destroying everything and everyone in sight, while taking some people captive, shredding them up and spitting out their blood & guts as food for their alien plants (which is, evidently, one of the alien's primary food sources). This, of course, creates an incredibly eerie reddish landscape.I love the intimidating bellow of the tripods.There are numerous memorable scenes: The opening attack in New York/New Jersey, the Hudson River ferry scene, the train in flames, the military night fight on the hill and the basement sequence.I also love the authentic Eastern locations, filmed in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and New Jersey.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Spielberg masterfully creates the illusion that the story is REAL and could possibly happen, but then blows it with sequences that destroy all credibility. Take, for instance, the plane crash segment. The jet crashes and destroys practically the entire neighborhood, including the house Cruise and his kids are staying at (in the basement). Yet, miraculously, their vehicle remains completely unscathed, not to mention they're able to easily drive out through the enormous amount of debris. Why Sure! This is insulting to the intelligence of the viewer and ruins the aura of realism. What was Spielberg thinking? He's a great filmmaker but he makes these kinds of blunders too often. Remember the scene in 'Jurrasic Park: The Lost World' where the colossal t.rex's are able to quietly sneak up on a campsite of people, yet in every other scene the ground literally shakes when they approach? Or how about the moronic and melodramatic dogtag sequence in 'Saving Private Ryan'? Spielberg likes to include father/son conflicts in his stories, which is fine, but he horribly fumbles the ball in this regard in 'War Of the Worlds.' Specifically, I'm talking about the military fight on the hill sequence where Cruise's son ludicrously decides to leave his dad and sister to presumably help fight the aliens (or who knows what?). But, wait a second, he's only 15 or 16 years old; he doesn't know anything about military weaponry or tactics, how could he possible be of any help? The entire scene where the son insists on separating from his dad and sister is just stoo-pid and unbelievable.BOTTOM LINE: I'd give the film a solid A- or B+ if it wasn't for the incredibly dumb sequences just noted. The only way I can watch and enjoy the picture is to make believe they're not there. These negatives force me to lower my rating to C+. It's a shame.",5,1,2,13 March 2014
There Will Be Blood," Weighty, morose period drama with complex characters and Daniel Day-Lewis
","In the early 20th century, an industrious prospector in Southern California, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), becomes a shrewd oil magnate, whose journey is paralleled with a dubious Pentecostal pastor of a remote church, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano).'There Will Be Blood' (2007) is a one-of-a-kind period drama with Western elements. It's arty and the furthest thing from a conventional blockbuster. You have to be in the mode for a deep, slow-moving, epic flick like this in order to appreciate it. The contemporaneous 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' and 'No Country for Old Men' are good comparisons.Whilst the story and main characters are simple on the surface, they go deep and there are many gems to mine: What good is success if you have no one to love and enjoy it with? Is Daniel a sociopath or a quality individual who acquires sociopathic tendencies because his choices put him on the road of madness? Was Eli a 'false prophet'? If so, was he always a con or did he become one?Why is Eli paralleled with Daniel? Does Daniel have the capacity for genuine love? Does he mean what he ultimately says to HW or are they words born from a sense of betrayal? Would a sane person rashly resort to murder? Is there a positive protagonist in the movie? If so, who and why? If not, why not?The film runs 2 hours, 38 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal and Texas (Shafter & Marfa); and Lakewood, Washington (Thornewood Castle).GRADE: B",7,1,2,15 August 2019
Burlesque," 'Coyote Ugly' meets 'Chicago' with Christina Aguilera & Cher
","Released in 2010, 'Burlesque' is a drama/musical about a bored small town girl (Christina Aguilera) who moves to the big city to better her life and, hopefully, do something with her great talents. She gets a waitress job at a nightclub and eventually talks the owner (Cher) into allowing her to perform. Cam Gigandet plays the potential beau while Peter Gallagher appears as the club owner's ex-husband and part owner. Stanley Tucci plays the likable stage manager while Kristen Bell & Julianne Hough are on hand as dancers. Eric Dane plays the arrogant mogul who wants to purchase the club and build condos. My title blurb says it all: 'Burlesque' combines the plot of 2000's 'Coyote Ugly' with elements of 2002's 'Chicago,' particularly the curvy women and burlesque dancing sequences. While it failed to achieve the moderate success of 'Coyote Ugly' at the box office, it's a significantly better movie. Although both films have the familiar formula plot, 'Burlesque' has a more compelling story with a more dynamic cast and superior song & dance. It also has better women, as far as curvy appeal goes (with the arguable exception of Piper Perabo, the women in 'Coyote Ugly' had the non-curvy shape of 12 year-old boys). Someone criticized that Aguilera was too 'old' for the role. Poppycock. She was 29 during filming and easily passed for someone in her late teens/early twenties. Despite her alluring powers, she had the youthful/winsome/innocent vibe to pull off the part. There's a surprising peripheral plot about how homosexual relationships start with 'sex' and proceed from there. The film runs 119 minutes and was shot entirely at Sony Pictures Studios, Culver City, California. It was written & directed by Steve Antin. GRADE: B-",6,0,3,24 March 2017
Joker," Not fun, but absorbing, artistic and tragic
","A mentally troubled middle-aged clown (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City goes from not good to worse when he finally realizes his true identity. Robert DeNiro plays a talk show host and Zazie Beetz the friendly girl down the hall. Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce's rich father.'Joker' (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics' villain, but it's more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain). The movie's captivating from the get-go and practically everything works for a broodingly superb cinematic experience.There are several amusing bits, but this ain't a fun flick. It's heavy and tragic. But what's the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He's a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber's 'Night of the Laughing Dead' in Man-Thing #5 (1974).The movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).GRADE: A-/A",8,8,15,15 December 2019
The Bridge on the River Kwai," 'Madness... madness... '
","I haven't seen David Lean's award-winning 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957) for so long that I forgot how great it is. It's not a conventional war film and therefore there's very little action; the 'action' is mostly psychological. I remember watching it on TV a few times with my dad when I was about 7-12 years old and even then, with such little understanding of the world and its social workings, I was fascinated by the picture and knew it was great -- even then.THE PLOT: A platoon of British soldiers are brought to a Japanese POW camp in Burma during World War II to help build a strategic railway bridge over the River Kwai. The Jap Colonel in charge of the camp, Saito, insists that the British officers work along with the enlisted men. The British Colonel, Nicholson, stubbornly objects to this based on the Geneva Convention, a copy of which he carries around in his pocket. He insists that there are rules to be followed, even in war. What ensues is a battle of wills between the two. Ultimately Nicholson is put in charge of building the bridge, which he takes so much pride in he fails to see that he's aiding the enemy. Meanwhile, an American sailor, Shears, escapes the camp and later leads a group of Brits on a mission to destroy the bridge.Although Colonel Nicholson, played by Alec Guinness, is a fascinating character -- an ultra-proper stiff-upper-lip Brit -- and certainly worthy of respect as far as his utter boldness goes, he's what my dad would call a 'goon.' (My dad served during WWII and died in 1988). Nicholson is so infected by pride, stubbornness and a sense of superiority that he can't see the obvious. Yes, he's a realistic and fascinating character, but I find him to be a total moron who can't see the forest for the trees. It goes without saying that I can't relate to him at all.Colonel Saito, the Japanese commander of the camp, ultimately accepts that it's in his best interest to allow Nicholson to believe he's running the show in order to get the bridge built. This is obviously a struggle for Saito because he has pride as well; but he refuses to allow it to get in the way of fulfilling his mission. 'Let Nicholson build the bridge and believe he's in charge and superior,' he seems to figure, 'In reality he's my pawn and a pawn of the Japanese military machine.' (Others may interpret this scenario differently, likely suggesting that Saito is the loser in the test of wills, moping around in bewildered defeat throughout the rest of the picture, but that's not what's really going on IMHO).William Holden expertly plays Shears, the American who escapes the camp and comes back to attempt to destroy the bridge. He's the the character I relate to most. On the surface he appears completely selfish -- doing whatever he must to survive, including lying and bribing. Shears has lived with the madness of war the longest and naturally develops a sarcastic, anti-hero callousness to protect himself and survive with his sanity intact. Despite the negative, selfish vibe you get from Shears, he never loses his humanity. He refuses to become an inhuman machine like Nicholson or Major Warden (Jack Hawkins), the latter of whom leads the British mission to destroy the bridge.For example, as Warden and his party travel through the jungle Warden becomes injured and insists that the rest leave him behind to die, arguing that he would do precisely the same if anyone else was injured. Shears blows up at this point; he's seen enough of this idiotic machine-like do-or-die mentality. He yells, 'You make me sick with your heroics! ... You and Colonel Nicholson, you're two of a kind, crazy with courage. For what? How to die like gentlemen? How to die by the rules? When the only important thing is how to live like a human being!' As captivating as the first hour is with the psychological conflict between Nicholson and Saito, the remaining hour and 41 minutes is even more engaging as the two story lines develop and ultimately converge: Nicholson building the bridge and celebrating its completion, along with his now-comrade Saito, while Shears & Warden and their team travel to the bridge and attempt to implement it's destruction.I just saw the film the other day but hadn't seen it for 8 years or so and I actually forgot exactly how it ended, as far as who dies, etc. Don't worry, I'm not going to give any major details away; you've probably forgotten the details as well, that is, if you've even seen it before. In any event, the ending is brilliant and potent. The Allied doctor of the camp looks on in utter disbelief at the climatic results. 'Madness... madness...' is all he can manage to mutter. Powerful.Needless to say, this is filmmaking of the highest order on every level. The Sri Lanka locations are breath-taking. The only negative I can muster is that parts of the score are understandably dated seeing as how it was released in 1957. But that whistling theme is hugely memorable, of course.I could probably write a book about all the great scenes, lines and points the film makes but I'd rather you discover (or re-discover) everything for yourself. There's so much depth here that you'll get something new with each viewing. It goes without saying that 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is one of the best pictures ever made and one of my all-time favorites.Grade: A",9,0,1,18 May 2014
A Hard Day's Night," Shut Up and Sing
","Directed by Richard Lester and written by Alun Owen, 'A Hard Day's Night' is a musical comedy starring the Beatles at the initial explosion of 'Beatlemania.' The movie focuses on several days in the lives of the members while in England, including recording music and a concert at the end with the requisite screaming pubescent girls.While the Beatles were before my time, they were indeed great. There was something about the chemistry of the members that produced catchy hit after hit during their decade together from 1960-1970. When 'A Hard Day's Night' (the movie) was released in the summer of '64, simultaneously with the album of the same name, they had only three albums of material released in two years, 1963-1964. The producers wanted to get a movie out before their popularity waned, like practically every other pop rock artist or group. But their fame was not to decline, as their appeal spread to young and older alike. They would release four more movies before breaking up, if you include the animated 'Yellow Submarine.' 'A Hard Day's Night' is considered a cult movie, and I can see why. It captures the group while they're not much more than kids, still in shock about their skyrocketing success. The best parts, of course, are the music numbers, which play like what would later become known as music videos. Seriously, any time one of their hooky ditties starts playing your attention perks up and your feet & hands start moving in delight. It's the in between scenes that are problematic. You might enjoy these sequences more than me if you're enamored by the members. I'm not; I just like their music. I suppose it doesn't help that these episodes are plagued by mumbling dialogue with the corresponding English accent, not to mention British humor from the time period that I mostly don't 'get.' The film runs 87 minutes and was shot entirely in England.GRADE: B-",6,3,5,15 February 2017
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," The spirit of freedom vs. the spirit of legal-ism
","Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the 'mental illness' card to get out of prison time, thinking it'll be a piece of cake, but he's wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy's ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' (1975) is a film you'll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn't 'get' a lot of the insights the film conveys.The movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their 'therapy' is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer's expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be 'dealt with.'A lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched 'isn't that bad' or that 'she was only trying to do her job', etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film's brilliance: Ratched's malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she's authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.The filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway's portrayal of Joan Crawford in 'Mommie Dearest,' which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn't such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).McMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he's impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.Nurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That's because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that 'appearances' are not about inward reality and, worse, 'the letter kills.'Despite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you'll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren't any good people in such institutions, of course).No review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of 'Chief' Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.The film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.GRADE: A",9,40,45,21 October 2012
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Dracula: A Love Story
","Released at Christmas time 1992, Francis Ford Coppola's version of the oft-filmed tale was fairly successful at the US box office, costing $40 million and bringing in $82.5 million; it earned an additional $133 million worldwide for a total of $216 million. These are good figures for back then.POSITIVES:* This is easily the most stylistic and visually opulent film version of Dracula.* The first 88 minutes, up to Lucy's vampiric resurrection, are great.* I've always thought one of the best parts of the original novel was the beginning where Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvania to visit the Count at his castle and the ensuing horror. This entire sequence is done very well in Coppola's version.* Harker's run-in with Drac's three brides is outstanding. Monica Belucci appears as one of the three ravishing-yet-diabolic brides; she was one of the most beautiful women in the world at the time.* Another great scene is the surreal sequence in Lucy's lavish gardens where she's seduced by Dracula in man-wolf form, spied by Mina.* Lucy's vampiric resurrection in the tomb is well done & creepy.* Drac's supernatural aspects are played up here more than any other version of the tale (up to that point); he appears as an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a man-wolf, a bunch of rats, a green mist, and a man-bat creature.* Sadie Frost puts her whole heart into the role of Lucy and is excellent. Winona Ryder is also effective as the meek Mina.* Not to mention Anthony Hopkins makes the best Van Helsing with his determined, hardy spunk.* The score by Wojciech Kilar is fitting and memorable.* Writer James V. Hart gets creative and adds an interesting twist to the done-to-death yarn. I'm referring to Drac's love for Mina, who's evidently his wife reincarnated. This new element helps keep the story interesting for those who may be bored with the oft-told tale.* The ultimate message of the film is great: Love conquers all and the light of God's presence brings redemption to those whose hearts still blip with a glimmer of hope, faith and love, no matter how mired in darkness. Freedom & forgiveness are there IF you want it.NEGATIVES:* Despite the title, this is not a faithful version of Stoker's book. The difference is that the Dracula in Coppola & Hart's version is not a paragon of unadulterated evil, but rather a sympathetic vampire with a serious case of love-sickness. Needless to say, this takes the bite out of the Count's wicked exploits as it's nigh impossible for the viewer to be horrified by a character with whom s/he sympathizes.* Gary Oldman, who plays Dracula, does a great John Lennon impersonation.* The film is entertaining and successfully creates a horror atmosphere, but I never found it scary like, say, the 2004 remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose.' (This isn't really a negative to me since I don't really WANT to be scared; I want to sleep at night!)* The fact that Dracula appears in so many supernatural forms can be confusing on one's initial viewing, unless of course you're well-versed with the book; consequently, the viewer may have a hard time comprehending or even identifying the title character (Is he an old man, a younger man, a wolf, a bunch of rats, a werewolf, a mist, a man-bat or what?!).* The last act, which comprises the final 33 minutes (not including credits), loses the captivating appeal of the first 88 minutes. Up to this point Coppola & Hart obviously took their time with the characters and their story and it worked. The final act, however, seems like they rushed to tie everything up by the 2-hour mark. Don't get me wrong, the last act isn't bad and it has some quality action, but it's just not as good as the first two acts; it's a little confusing and the film suffers for it.* The final act contains two love scenes between Drac & Mina that are difficult to watch. I just get sick to my stomach viewing these sequences where Mina gets intimate with this nasty fiend (not sexually), particularly the scene in the chapel where Drac looks like a hellish man-bat. But, then again, I like the message: Genuine love & loyalty transcend personal failings and distasteful aspects, like a wife who still loves her husband even though she sees him floss his green teeth and washes his soiled underwear (lol).BOTTOM LINE: Coppola & Hart's version is colorfully lavish and adds an interesting love story to Stoker's tale with potent spiritual significance. This will, of course, turn-off purists who prefer the totally malevolent king of vampires of the original novel, which is what disenchanted me the first time I saw it, but who can blame Coppola & Hart for wanting to try something new with the well-worn yarn? Despite a fairly weak final act and a cobbled-together vibe, they largely succeed.Although losing points for the negatives listed above, I have to admit that this is probably my favorite version of the tale, which says a lot.Amazingly, the film was shot completely on studio sets, but doesn't seem like it. It runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.GRADE: B+/A-",8,1,2,31 March 2011
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Big, dumb, fun action flick with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in New York City
","RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by John McTiernan, 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' is the third of (currently) five installments in the Die Hard series. In this one, suspended New York City cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) rejoins the force to tangle with a mad-but-genius German bomber named 'Simon' (Jeremy Irons) while teaming up with a good Samaritan from Harlem (Samuel L. Jackson).This franchise fills the bill if you're in the mood for big, dumb, fun action thrills. Don't get me wrong because a lot of work goes into making these kinds of films and it takes talent & genius to pull them off. I mean 'dumb' in the sense that the focus is on unbelievable action rather than deeper themes beyond 'genuinely good people may be flawed, cocky and somewhat profane, but they're courageous and never give up in the face of evil.'The Die Hard flicks are the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's 'The Gauntlet' where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's 'The Mummy Returns.''Die Hard with a Vengeance' evades that ditch because it offers entertaining protagonists & antagonists, amusing scenes, worthy bits of character development and a compelling comic booky story.While all five Die Hard movies are of the same action expertise, I prefer the sequels because the original film took place almost entirely in and around a skyscraper. I favor the wider location scope of the others, including this one, which was the best up to this point.It starts out a little shaky because Simon's shenanigans are so contrived they're unbelievable, but if you can persevere the story builds momentum and there are surprises. Even John and Zeus' conflict-habituated relationship has a story arc with Zeus being bluntly confronted with his reverse racism. The sometimes contrary camaraderie of John and Zeus is great.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in New York City; Berkeley County, South Carolina; and Jessup, Maryland (ending).

Con Air," Comic booky pull-out-all-the-stops action/thriller with Nicolas Cage and John Cusack
","Released in 1997 and directed by Simon West, 'Con Air' is an action/thriller starring Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe, a former US Ranger and newly paroled ex-con who finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane where the hardened cons seize control, led by the brilliantly insane Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich). John Cusack and Colm Meaney co-star as the two conflicting officers in charge of resolving the situation. Some of the more notable cons are played by Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi.My title blurb says it all: 'Con Air' is a no-holds-barred action/thriller with a clever sense of humor in the compelling spirit of 1996's 'Broken Arrow,' although I give 'Con Air' the edge. Yes, the story's contrived and the movie's overall cartoony, but it's just so kinetic, amusing and well-executed you're inspired to go with it rather than go against it. In fact, you'll probably find yourself hilariously laughing at moments, particularly in the third act. On top of this, the movie shoots for a little depth with the well-done (and amusing) redemption of a certain con.The weak point is the lack of a quality female role. Sure, there's the guard on the plane played by Rachel Ticotin, but her role is rather one-dimensional; however, I do appreciate a later scene with her and Poe. Monica Potter is on hand as Poe's wife, but her part is limited to standing around looking doe-eyed. Despite this cavil, 'Con Air' delivers the goods for what it is; and spectacularly so. The movie runs 115 minutes and was shot in Indiana, Utah, Nevada and California. GRADE: A-",8,1,2,10 September 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Three great scenes and the ravishing Christina, but too many flat, juvenile, vulgar non-jokes

Vince Vaughn plays a rival anchorman.Howard Hawks supplied the simplest definition of a good movie: Three great scenes. No bad scenes. 'Anchorman' gets the first part right with three great comedic sequences (the flute player at the club, the anchorman rumble and the climatic zoo sequence). Unfortunately too many jokes fall flat in between these episodes (Carell's outlandish lines in particular) and there's way too much infantile vulgarity. The first half hour is so bad in this regard I almost tuned out. Christina is stunning, though, and never looked better. Whether the positives outweigh the negatives is your call. The movie run 94 minutes (there are extended cuts, but I strongly recommend the shortest one). It was shot in San Diego, Los Angeles, Long Beach and Glendale, California. WRITERS: Ferrell & McKay. ADDITIONAL CAST: Jack Black, Ben Stiller and several others have cameos.GRADE: C-",4,0,0,12 July 2017
The Green Mile," A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art -- Captivating, Reverent, Tear-Inducing
","'The Green Mile' expertly mixes film genres: It's part prison flick, part supernatural mystery and part drama. It was adapted from Stephen King's novel by director/writer Frank Darabont and released in 1999. If you're not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I'm not) DON'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; 'The Green Mile' is by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.THE STORY: Tom Hanks plays the head Death Row guard at a Tennessee prison during the Depression. A new inmate is introduced, a hulking black man named John Coffey (exquisitely played by Michael Clarke Duncan), who is condemned to death for the rape and murder of two little girls. Hanks and his guard friends slowly become intrigued by the seemingly pure-hearted giant and begin to realize that he is eminently gifted in a decidedly supernatural way; they conclude that there's no way he could be guilty of the crime. If that's the case, who is guilty? And will the guilty party get away with it.'The Green Mile' is a 3-hour film, way over my limited attention span, and yet it is somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. The film is character/dialogue driven, unique and wholly unpredictable. Please don't mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue. This is an incredibly powerful supernatural mystery/drama.*** SPOILER ALERT *** (Don't read this next paragraph unless you want to consider possibilities about the character John Coffey) John Coffey's last name is, evidently, derived from an ancient Sumerian word, kophi, which means 'winged creature.' Hence, John could be viewed as a angel or messenger from the Almighty. In truth, John is an obvious type of Jesus Christ verified in six ways: (1.) His initials are J.C. (2.) He's completely pure/good-hearted and can easily recognize true evil. (3.) He miraculously heals people. (4.) He pronounces and executes divine judgment. (5.) He is sacrificed even though completely innocent. And (6.) He offers eternal life (in a sense), as evidenced by the extended life-span of the Hanks character and the mouse 'Mr. Jingles.' *** End SPOILER ALERT *** BOTTOM LINE: Make no mistake, 'The Green Mile' is one of the greatest films ever made. It ranks up there with my 5 or 10 best. Don't miss out on this cinematic masterpiece. Now please excuse me while I wipe the tears from my face.",9,5,8,19 August 2011
The Wrestler," 'The Wrestler' (2008)
","Twenty years past his glory days in the mid/late 80s, a wrestler (Mickey Rourke) struggles to make ends meet in New Jersey while wrestling on the weekends, taking illegal pain-meds, pursuing a dancer at the local strip club (Marisa Tomei) and trying to reestablish a relationship with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood).This is an engrossing, but gloomy drama about the grim reality of celebrities from practically any field who are long past their prime; it just happens to be a wrestler in this case. People mock how fake wrestling is, but those talented guys bend over backwards to entertain the audience with incredibly painful stunts. The film was shot in the winter in New Jersey and this augments the bleak pall.On the female front, Marisa is absolutely stunning as Cassidy (aka Pam) and Wood is convincing as the embittered daughter. Their relationships with the protagonist are a mixture of sweet, agonizing and moving.The soundtrack features several quality songs from the 80s: 'Bang Your Head,' 'Round and Round,' 'Balls to the Wall,' 'Animal Magnetism,' 'Dangerous,' 'Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone),' 'Sweet Child o' Mine' and more.The movie reminded me of 80's metal star Jon Mikl Thor and the excellent documentary 'I Am Thor' (2015) and, to a lesser extent, 'Anvil: The Story of Anvil' (2008). While neither of these is as melancholic as 'The Wrestler,' and 'I Am Thor' is sometimes laugh-out-loud amusing, they both effectively show the grey reality of former real-life celebs well past their halcyon days.The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes.GRADE: A-",8,1,1,26 September 2018
Dark Shadows," I don't get all the hate
","On coastal Maine, a Vampire named Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) is released in 1972 after almost 200 years in captivity and reacquaints himself with his family's chateau & the nearby fishing village. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the Collins matriarch, Helena Bonham Carter the in-house shrink, Eva Green a conniving witch, Bella Heathcote the reincarnation of Barnabas' long-lost love and Chloë Grace Moretz a 15 year-old punk.Directed by Tim Burton, 'Dark Shadows' (2012) isn't far removed in tone from his 'Sleepy Hollow' (1999), which also featured Depp as the protagonist, although I suppose 'Shadows' throws in a little more humor. I've never seen the TV soap opera Dark Shadows or the subsequent two movies, so I can't compare this movie to them. All I know is that I liked this rendition quite a bit, just as I liked the inexplicably reviled 'The Lone Ranger' (2013).The October/November ambiance (i.e. Halloween-season) is to die for and Depp as Barnabas Collins maintains your interest throughout. He's obviously a fish-out-of-water in 1972, but acclimates pretty quickly. Eva Green is perfect as the ee-vil witch and Carter is enjoyable as usual. I don't get the hubbub over Moretz, but she's a'right (and holds a surprise for the last act). Alice Cooper is featured in a glorified cameo. I should add that the opening credits sequence with 'Nights in White Satin' is cinema at its finest.The movie runs 1 hour, 53 minutes and was shot in England (Devon, Buckinghamshire, Kent, Cornwall & Farnham) and Scotland (Mull, Argyll and Bute) with exteriors of the chateau shot at Trafalgar Castle School, Whitby, Ontario, Canada.GRADE: B",7,1,1,4 November 2018

While training him, they hook-up with the earstwhile girlfriend (Vanessa Angel) of a wealthy bowling enthusiast (Rob Moran) and head to a Tournament in Reno, Nevada, where they reaquaint with a conman and competitor (Bill Murray).'Kingpin' (1996) is a Farrelly brothers comedy marred by their usual distasteful elements, e.g. bathroom & sex humor. If you can get past that or roll with it, this is a decent story of redemption with some laughs augmented by the road-movie plot.The film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in Pennsylvania (Mars, Rochester & Pittsburgh), Nevada (Reno) and New York (Webster).GRADE: B-",6,0,2,4 June 2020
Kong: Skull Island," Delivers the goods for fantasy-adventure lovers
","Released in 2017 and directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, 'Kong: Skull Island' takes place in 1973 where a military crew about to depart Vietnam is commissioned to guide an expedition to map out the eponymous island. Of course, the giant ape, Kong, is soon discovered, as well as several other deadly colossal creatures, including reptilian underground monsters dubbed 'Skullcrawlers.' Will anyone make it out alive? Like my title blurb says, this delivers the goods for fantasy-adventure lovers. The opening act is great with its kinetic air and excellent late 60s/early 70's soundtrack. The rest of the movie more or less keeps up the entertainment value, highlighted by the racially diverse cast, led by Samuel L. Jackson, John Goodman, Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson and John C. Reilly; there are many others.'Skull Island' has the high adventure demanded in a King Kong flick and is arguably on par with the original 'King Kong' (1933), as well as the 1976 and 2005 versions, although it's superior to the latter because it lacks that one's pretentious over-length, cartoonish CGI-jungles and overkill action sequences (like the absurd brontosaurus stampede). Of course, it's criminal to compare a modern CGI-oriented flick with a classic like the 1933 film (or even the '76 version); I'm just saying that, if you favor those movies, you'll probably relish this one because it's cut from the same cloth and is effective for what it is, a colossal creature adventure flick. For further comparison, 'Skull Island' is pretty much as good or, IMO, better than any of the Jurassic Park pictures.Along with the thrilling jungle escapades, there are some interesting subtexts and gems to mine, like the quasi-Ahab subplot and the fact that dropping myriad bombs might not be the best answer. Early in the film the photographer (Brie) tells the the gung-ho Colonel (Jackson) that America lost the Vietnam War. Yet, this isn't really accurate since the USA won every battle of that infamous conflict. So the colonel rightly corrects her: 'We didn't lose the war; we abandoned it.' The movie runs 118 minutes and was shot in Ha Long Bay, Quang Ninh, Vietnam; Oahu, Hawaii; and Queensland, Australia; with studio work done in Los Angeles.GRADE: B+",7,7,13,7 May 2017
Bring It On," It's cheer-tastic (groan)
","Released in 2000 and directed by Peyton Reed, 'Bring it On' is a high school dramedy/satire/sports flick starring Kirsten Dunst as, Torrance, the new captain of a champion San Diego cheering squad. Eliza Dushku co-stars as Torrance's new feisty teammate, Missy, while Jesse Bradford is on hand as Missy's brother and Torrance's possible romantic interest. Torrance and her team are devastated when they discover that their championship routines were ripped-off from an inner city cheer team by the former captain; now they have to learn all-new routines to win the championships in Florida.'Bring it On' was a surprise minor hit and inspired four direct-to-video sequels (all stand-alone films): 'Bring it On Again' (2004), 'Bring it On: All or Nothing' (2006), 'Bring it On: In it to Win it' (2007) and 'Bring it On: Fight to the Finish' (2009). Being the only theatrically released movie in the series, 'Bring it On' is the most polished in the series.While it thankfully lacks visual raunch, like the vulgar 'American Pie' flicks, it's sometimes verbally lascivious and profane, but in a witty, humorous way. In Roger Ebert's review he went on and on about how 'Bring it On' is basically an R-rated movie watered down barely enough to get a PG-13 rating to sell more tickets. He decried that it's too foul for kids under 13 and too juvenile for older teens & adults. Although the former's true the latter is poppycock. Anyone who's been to high school (or is going through it) and is slightly familiar with cheerleaders will relate to 'Bring it On' and be entertained. The flick successfully balances high school dramedy with sports movie conventions while satirizing cheerleaders; it's kinetic, smart, amusing, irreverent, over-the-top and realistic at the same time.Ebert also denounced the film on the grounds that the movie is condescending toward high school minorities. Baloney. It simply reflects reality in that inner city schools in America are predominantly black and lack the funds of more affluent suburban schools.Dunst and Dushku are good protagonists and easily carry the film, but they never appealed to me much, which isn't to say I dislike them. But it doesn't matter because there are so many peripheral cuties on hand. 'All or Nothing' is easily the best in the series as far as female cast goes (highlighted by Hayden Panettiere and Danielle Savre).The film runs 98 minutes and was shot entirely in the San Diego area.GRADE: B",7,0,0,24 November 2016
Centurion," Solid sword & sandal flick with hints of greatness
","'Centurion' takes place circa 117-122 AD in Great Britain and speculates the fate of the Roman 9th Legion, which disappeared at the time and remains a mystery to this day.PLOT: Seven legion survivors of a surprise Pictish attack go into enemy territory to retrieve their general (Dominic West). The legionnaires then go deeper into the wilderness to escape the vengeance of the Picts with the intention of looping back around. Unfortunately for them, the Picts have an expert tracker on hand; a mute woman with whom the Romans are quite familiar.ANALYSIS: Michael Fassbender is outstanding as the leader of the remaining legionnaires, Quintus Dias, while Olga Kurylenko is effective as the vengeful Pict tracker, Etain, and Imogen Poots shines as an outcast in the wilderness, Arianne.The scenery of the film is breathtaking, shot on location in England and Scotland, whilst the pace is brisk at a mere 97 minutes. The latter reveals the weakness of the film as this is definitely a tale that would've worked better at 2 hours minimum. Although there are some quality character-defining sequences and near-epic moments, the film needed more. As it is, it's kind of a blur, but still very worthwhile. The score's quite good as well.BOTTOM LINE: 'Centurion' is reminiscent of 2004's 'King Arthur,' as far as story, location and overall tone go. The main difference is that the events in 'King Arthur' take place 350 years later and involve the legendary Arthur as a Roman warrior. 'Centurion,' by contrast, occurs when Hadrian's Wall was just starting to materialize. Both films are worthwhile to sword & sandal devotees, but 'King Arthur' ultimately plays better due to its longer runtime and therefore more characterization and epic-ness.Be sure to catch 2011's 'The Eagle,' which is essentially the (unofficial) sequel to 'Centurion' where the son of the general of the 9th legion ventures into the Pictish wilderness with a Briton slave to regain the 9th legion's gold eagle standard. 'The Eagle' is less Hollywoodized, has a much better first act and is all-around more realistic, but 'Centurion' is more conventionally entertaining, has important female characters and a superior last act.GRADE: B+ *** SPOILERS FOLLOW*** One reviewer complained that the film fails to provide conventional protagonists: How can you root for the Romans when they're the invading army who were responsible for raping Etain when she was a girl, killing her parents, and cutting out her tongue? In addition, at least one legionnaire is revealed to be a total scumbag. But then it's hard to root for the Picts since Etain is so bitter and vengeful, plus the Picts are pretty much portrayed as the antagonists to the remaining members of the 9th legion.I would argue that the film encourages us to disregard political loyalties (Roman, Pict or otherwise) and root for the persons worthy of rooting for. In this case, Quintus Dias and Arianne (the 'witch'). Why? Because they both prove to have hearts of gold, which is one of the reasons they're so drawn to each other, beyond the physical attraction.As for the film's message, it's driven home at the end: Big government is not worthy of your absolute loyalty and service because they'll throw you to the wolves in a second if it serves their purposes. (Government in general is good and necessary but big government is intrinsically untrustworthy and harmful, i.e. evil).",7,1,4,29 August 2012
Platoon," 'Rejoice O young man in thy youth' ~ Ecclesiastes 11:9
","That's the title card to Oliver Stone's 1986 Vietnam War masterpiece 'Platoon', but you're not going to see much rejoicing in this film 'cause it identifies the Vietnam infantry experience as no less than hell on earth.THE PLOT: Chris Taylor naively volunteers for combat in Vietnam (late '67 through '68) and slowly adapts to the jungle warfare and becomes an adequate grunt. A rift eventually develops between the senior sergeant, Barnes (Tom Berenger), and the junior sergeant, Elias (Willem Dafoe); the former a veritable indestructible killing machine and the latter an expert soldier who refuses to allow the horrors of war to rob him of his humanity.'Platoon' is masterful movie-making in practically every way and towers over most other Vietnam war flicks, with the sole exception of 'Apocalypse Now' (the original version). What works best is the ensemble cast and the numerous memorable characters who all smack of real life -- Taylor, Barnes, Elias, Lt. Wolfe, O'Neill, Bunny, Junior, King, Rhah, Crawford, Tex and Big Harold (amongst others). The idea that any filmmaker can effectively bring to life a dozen or more characters like this in a 2-hour film is uncanny to say the least.Memorable moments abound, including: <ul><li>After stumbling upon a just-abandoned Vietcong nest where a soldier comes up missing, the platoon finds his corpse staked-up down the river and the camera slowly pans across the visage of practically every platoon member culminating with Barnes, who mutters with seething vengeance. This is a potent scene spotlighting a band of American warriors, from very diverse racial/ethnic/socio-economic backgrounds, forced together halfway around the world in some God-forsaken jungle to face an enemy of jungle wraiths.</li></ul><ul><li>After the Barnes/Elias fight at the village Barnes is informed by Captain Harris that there will be a full investigation. Barnes leaves the meeting and walks by his two disciples O'Niell and Bunny. O'Neill asks Barnes if there's going to be an investigation. The laconic Barnes stops but doesn't answer; he just looks away, as if in thought, smoking his cigarette. The camera stays on Barnes while Bunny responds: 'O'Neill, man, you worry to much; the sergeant will take care of him.' Looking at Barnes' countenance you just KNOW he's contemplating murder. The scene is filmmaking of the highest order.</li></ul><ul><li>In a dugout six of the soldiers who sided with Elias discuss what to do after it appears Elias had been shot by Barnes in combat. They all want to kill the scarred-face Barnes, but Rhah reveals Barnes' stature with the men is nigh mythological at this point; he's been hit seven times and still isn't dead. 'Barnes ain't meant to die! The only thing that can kill Barnes is Barnes'. A shirtless Barnes suddenly appears, drinking a bottle of whiskey; apparently he heard the whole conversation. He boldly confronts all six with a fascinating rant ('I am reality') and challenges them to kill him. None of them take the bait because they deem him a human tiger, except Taylor, who's no match for Barnes in man-to-man combat. Although Barnes is the villain in the film you can't help but admire his sheer boldness and killer skills; it's clear why the men respect and fear him.</li></ul>By contrast, Elias is the compassionate, loving and righteous Christ-figure. If there's any doubt to this it's bludgeoned into the viewer via the melodramatic and unrealistic death scene, which can be (slightly) excused on the grounds of its iconic imagery (the cover of the DVD) and obvious symbolism. This scene is the only reason I rate the film 9/10 rather than 10/10.Bunny (Kevin Dillon) is an interesting character. He's young, simple and likable but the war morphs him into a nigh-psychotic killer, so much so that he seriously creeps the other men out. But, again, he somehow maintains an amiable charm, unlike Tex who comes across wholly venomous.Some have criticized that it's impossible to make a war film that's anti-war on the grounds that war films by their nature make war seem fun in an adventurous way. Not so with 'Platoon'. How did Stone accomplish this? Well, aside from skillfully showing the hard day-to-day life of infantry men in the jungle, the combat scenes are viewed from the grunt's disoriented perspective where, often, there are no clear battle lines of good guys/bad guys (even within the platoon itself!); the enemy -- ghostly figures who are never clearly seen -- can come from any angle. Anything can and does happen, at anytime. Stone denies the viewer the feeling that this type of jungle combat makes sense. Needless to ask, how can anyone go through such without being inwardly scarred for life? Some criticize the flagrant cussing but Stone was shooting for realism; I know from experience that this is generally how grunts talk. I don't know about you but, if I'm going to see a war film, I want to see the awful truth, not some cleaned-up fantasy BS.The ending shows that Barnes & Elias are figurative of flesh & spirit, the conflicting forces within us all. (SPOILER) Taylor reflects, 'The war is over for me now, but it will always be there the rest of my days, as I'm sure Elias will be, fighting with Barnes for what Rhah called 'possession of my soul'. There are times since I've felt like a child, born of those two fathers. But, be that as it may, those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again, to teach to others what we know, and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness and a meaning to this life.' Amen.GRADE: A",9,1,2,12 January 2011
Scream," Strange parody/horror mix with obnoxious characters
","Released in 1996, Wes Craven's 'Scream' chronicles the murders of various people linked to a high school in a California town by someone dressed in a ghost-face Halloween costume. Neve Campbell plays the protagonist, Rose McGowan her best friend, Skeet Ulrich her boyfriend, Matthew Lillard his best friend, David Arquette the deputy, Courteney Cox an annoying reporter, Joseph Whipp the sheriff and Jamie Kennedy a dude that works at a video store.People keep hailing 'Scream' as some kind of stand-out slasher flick, but it's not IMHO. It tries to walk the balance beam between serious slasher and amusing parody, which creates an odd vibe throughout. At no time was I able to buy what was going on as reality. The camp and contrivances kept screaming 'This is all a joke,' like Henry Winkler's weird principal. As such, the movie's never scary despite some shocking elements and gore.Another negative is the host of unlikable, obnoxious or annoying characters. Campbell is serviceable as the heroine and McGowan is awesome just because she's so alluring. Drew Barrymore is also good, but her presence is limited to a glorified cameo in the prologue. I realize that the rest of the characters are so distasteful because this is a whodunit and most of them are potential suspects, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they make for an unpleasant viewing experience. Before you say, 'But this is a horror flick and therefore it's supposed to be unpleasant,' I get that; I'm talking about how most of the main characters are so repugnant it's impossible to care about them. Let 'em all get slashed to death for all I care, lol. Then there's the ridiculously over-the-top last act, which is so contrived, cartoony and drenched in fake blood you'll just roll your eyes in disbelief. All this is compounded by the clumsy and weak killer, which I suppose makes sense when you later discover who the killer is.Thankfully, there's some good beyond the three girls noted above (especially McGowan, who's a pleasure to watch), like the numerous references to horror flick lore and the whodunit factor, but none of these redeem it from being a joke of a slasher. It's worth seeing if you like slasher movies, if for no other reason than to see if it matches the over-hype, but you'll probably be disappointed because of the disagreeable characters and the odd horror/parody fusion, not to mention the cartooniness and contrivances.The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in Santa Rosa, Tomales, Glen Ellen, Healdsburg and Sonoma, California.GRADE: C-",4,0,2,11 November 2015
Halloween," The Boogeyman cometh
","A soulless killer, Michael Myers, escapes from the asylum and returns to the Illinois town where he murdered his sister 15 years earlier to wreak havoc on Halloween night. Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers' seriously concerned doctor.John Carpenter's 'Halloween' (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, 'Halloween' was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like 'Psycho' (1960), 'Dementia 13' (1963), 'A Bay of Blood' (1971) 'Torso (1973), 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974) and 'Black Christmas' (1974). 'Friday the 13th' (1980) and its sequels took the 'Halloween' template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.Whilst I prefer the 'Friday' films, 'Halloween' has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt 'The Slumber Party Massacre' (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as 'Friday the 13th Part 3' (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.Although the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What's NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it's not late October.Other problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls' conversation walking home from school, which doesn't ring true. Speaking of the girls, they're decent, but not nearly as good as the 'Friday' films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in 'Psycho'). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers' abode speaking portentously.I appreciate 'Halloween' because it's classy, atmospheric and it's a superb pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it's a tad overrated by gushing fans.GRADE: B",7,0,2,14 August 2018

The princess of the island (Gal Gadot) leaves with the captain to help end the Great War and destroy Ares forever.'Wonder Woman' (2017) combines the Wonder Woman TV series (1975-1979) with elements of 'All Quiet on the Western Front' (1979), 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' (1981), 'The Dirty Dozen' (1967), 'Captain America: The First Avenger' (2011) and 'Man of Steel' (2013). It's a well done modern superhero flick and superior to both 'The First Avenger' and 'Man of Steel.'The opening paradisal island sequence is good without overstaying its welcome. The story really picks up when Captain Steve Trevor and Diana depart the island. They have great chemistry and their relationship adds human interest.Unlike 'Man of Steel,' which devolved into super-beings constantly pulverizing each other in the second half, 'Wonder Woman' has the poise to take its time and establish an interesting assortment of characters. The entire midsection is great, but the last act, to be expected, comes down to two super-beings pounding each other.

Back to the Future Part II," Clever sequel is action-packed, but goofier and with a more complicated plot
","Released in 1989, 'Back to the Future Part II' stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen from 1985 who travels to 2015 with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) on his time machine. When they return to 1985 they discover that an item was inadvertently taken from 2015 and brought to 1955, which changed history and made Hill Valley a dystopia. So they frantically venture back to 1955 to try to correct the problem. Crispin Glover & Lea Thompson play Marty's parents while Thomas F. Wilson plays the villain, Biff. Elisabeth Shue replaces Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend, but she's asleep most of the movie.This is almost as good as the first movie, but the goofy tone of the first act throws it off, although it's action-packed. The next two acts are better as Marty & Doc go back in time and cleverly try to fix things. While the plot is way more complicated than the first film it's surprisingly easy to follow (Doc effectively explains the logistics in one scene). However, it's mandatory that you watch the first movie to fully appreciate this one. It can be argued that the movie was overly optimistic about the future (that is, 2015), but it was surprisingly accurate with some things, like video phones and, to some degree, hover-boards. But since the 'future' shown in the movie (2015) is a timeline manipulated by the protagonists it's an ALTERNATE reality and not necessarily the way things panned out in reality. It was Doc himself who invented the technology for flying automobiles since he already created the flying DeLorean in the first movie.The film runs 108 minutes and was shot in Oxnard, Monrovia, Arleta, Whittier, Baldwin Park, South Pasadena, Pasadena, Universal City and Los Angeles, California.

X-Men: First Class," When Xavier and Erik were friends
","Released in 2011 and directed by Matthew Vaughn, 'X-Men: First Class' chronicles the origins of the mutant superheroes and super-villains in 1962 when the US government decides to enlist the talents of people with superhuman abilities. This is before Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) took the names Professor X and Magneto and were friends rather than arch-nemeses. They and their teen team must stop the diabolical Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) from using the Cuban Missile Crisis to start a nuclear war to increase his power. Jennifer Lawrence appears as Mystique and Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert. Nicholas Hoult is on hand as Hank McCoy/Beast.It's interesting to go back to the early 60s when Xavier and Erik were friends and observe how the team got started, not to mention the eventual rift (the story deviates from the comic, of course, although there are some similarities). McAvoy easily carries the movie as Xavier; and Fassbender is effective as Magneto (and more fitting than Ian McKellen). I prefer Lawrence to Rebecca Romijn simply because she's curvier and cuter.

The Wolverine," Atypical superhero movie
","'The Wolverine' (2013) takes place after 'X-Men 3: The Last Stand' (2006) and focuses on Logan in Japan. It's reminiscent of Chris Claremont & Frank Miller's original 1982 4-part Wolverine miniseries.Like that miniseries, the film is very atypical for comic book superheroes. It plays out more like a James Bond flick, sort of a modern version of 'You Only Live Twice', than a conventional superhero flick. Logan (Hugh Jackman) never appears in an outlandish costume, nor do any other characters, except Viper, and hers isn't all that outlandish.The beginning is great -- the World War II prologue and the Yukon sequences. I also enjoyed the Japanese locations and culture, as well as the focus on drama mixed with stellar bouts of comic book action. Unfortunately, I found the story only moderately interesting, which is the main reason I rate the film as mediocre as I do. It just isn't all that captivating.I really liked the character of Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and Hiroyuki Sanada makes a quality antagonist, but I found Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) rather bland. The Silver Samurai also appears in an armored suit a la Iron Man or War Machine and comes across as typical for this type of fare.In addition, Famke Janssen appears as Jean Grey. She's fine in the role, but she never tripped my trigger. The best lookin' woman in the entire film, believe it or not, is the cashier who talks to Logan briefly in Yukon.I'll be honest with you, I thought 2009's 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' was better than this one. Despite the cartoony opening, it had more depth and was way more compelling. Still, 'The Wolverine' is a solid depiction of Wolverine's adventures in Japan.The film runs 2 hours and 6 minutes.GRADE: C+ or B-",6,0,1,10 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The best of the three
","I feel The Dark Knight Rises is the best of Nolan's Trilogy in overall entertainment. The hallmark of this series is its dark, gritty realism, at least as realistic as you can get for a superhero movie. I prefer this approach to the semi-goofy style of the 1989-97 series.Bane's a formidable villain and Anne Hatheway surprisingly plays a good 'Catwoman' (I say 'surprisingly' only because I thought she has too innocent/sweet of a quality to pull off the role). Also on hand is Marion Cotillard, who's stunning as Miranda Tate, and Joseph Gordon-Levite, who's effective as police officer Blake. Beyond these we get the principal characters/cast of the first two films, minus the Joker and Harvey Dent.My only beef with this series is that the plots are convoluted and there's an overload of characters, which means you really have to pay attention or you'll get lost in the process. This is never a problem when a story is ultra-compelling, but none of these films are, although 'The Dark Knight Rises' is definitely the most compelling of the three. This factor is what keeps this series from being great in my opinion.But don't take that the wrong way; I'm just being honest. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a quality Batman film.The film runs 165 minutes and was shot in Pittsburgh (Gotham City), England, Scotland, India, Italy, New York, Newark and California.GRADE: B+",7,0,2,8 June 2014
Black Panther," Overrated due to political correctness; it's noble and has its points of interest, but it's also kinda meh
","RELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Ryan Coogler, 'Black Panther' details events when T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman) takes over kingship of the hidden African nation Wakanda after his father passes (John Kani). The kingdom is technologically advanced due to its secret resource Vibranium, a priceless, almost magical metal. Unfortunately, T'Challa's reign is challenged by an angry American former-black ops soldier, Erik 'Killmonger' (Michael B. Jordan).With its black director and mostly black cast (with a couple of token white dudes), 'Black Panther' was overhyped and overrated upon release. Critics were apparently afraid of being called 'racist' by liberal fascists if they dared to be honest and say anything negative (rolling my eyes). The movie's likable and certainly has its points of interest, but the characters are rather dull, except for Killmonger, and the story isn't all that involving. It's basically a mediocre superhero movie that has some blatant Bond-isms and is set apart by its primarily black cast and African locale. It fails to rise to the entertainment level of even 'Ant-Man' (2015).Still, it's respectfully noble and the story provokes interesting questions, like isolationism vs. internationalism and African-American culture vs. Native African culture. But there's some eye-rolling bits, like when Shuri (Letitia Wright) calls CIA agent Ross (Martin Freeman) a 'colonizer,' which isn't even accurate. Maybe it was supposed to be a joke.The waterfall fight between the Black Panther and Killmonger was an homage to the first issue of The Black Panther series in Jungle Action: Issue #6, September, 1973. At the end of that comic's story T'Challa and Erik fight at the top of a waterfall culminating with Killmonger throwing Black Panther over the cliff. This issue was the beginning of the 'Panther's Rage' storyline by Don McGregor (featuring artists Billy Graham, Rich Buckler and Gil Kane), which ran for over two years in 13 issues of Jungle Action #6-18 and 209 pages, including the Epilogue. Many consider it the first graphic novel. Of course, this wasn't the first appearance of the Black Panther (who debuted in 1966), but it was the first issue where he was the starring character. And it was this series that provided the intriguing exposition on T'Challa, Wakanda and its citizens, visitors & enemies. It's a travesty that McGregor, who created the characters of Killmonger & W'Kabi (Daniel Kaluuya) and conceived this exposition, wasn't acknowledged in this movie; shameful.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours, 14 minutes and was shot in Georgia (Atlanta, Fayetteville), South Korea (Busan) and Iguazú Waterfalls, Argentina. Ironically, nothing was shot in Africa. WRITERS: Coogler and Joe Robert Cole (and, uncredited, Don McGregor).GRADE: B-",6,1,3,12 June 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Sluggish story, but realistic tone featuring the REAL Super-man (guest-starring Wonder Woman)
","Released in 2016 and directed by Zach Snyder, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' pits Batman against Superman via the manipulations of Lex Luthor. Wonder Woman joins the Word's Finest duo to take on the 'Hulk-on-Krytonian-steroids' Doomsday in the climatic battle.I viewed the Ultimate edition, which runs three hours; the theatrical version is a half hour shorter.This is an ambitious film, a superhero epic, touted by DC fans as the movie that would crush Marvel's supremacy in the superhero movie market, but it was a disappointment due to its sluggish story. It takes about half the film just to build up any drive; the first hour is the worst, although it's not without highlights. Thankfully, the second half is compelling to the end.Despite the listlessness of the first half, this is an impressive film and worthwhile for several reasons. For one, this is the absolute best depiction of Superman, as far as driving home his alien super-ness. Not to mention Henry Cavill is, by far, the best actor to play the Kryptonian. Secondly, the gritty realistic tone establishes in no uncertain terms that this is a totally serious superhero flick, which is driven home in the first act by the shocking murder of an iconic Superman Family character. It's akin to the feel of Nolan's Batman trilogy or 2003's 'Hulk,' the latter of which people love to hate because, apparently, it was a thinking-person's superhero film and didn't have enough 'Hulk smash' moments (even though the Hulk's 22-minute rampage that starts at the 92-minute mark is definitely one of the best action sequences put to film). (But, don't get me wrong, I agree with the main criticisms of 'Hulk,' I just don't let them prevent me from enjoying its good points).Thirdly, Ben Affleck makes for a great Bruce Wayne/Batman, on par with George Clooney's underrated depiction in 1997's 'Batman & Robin.' He's just all-around better than Christian Bale. Fourthly, Jesse Eisenberg is charismatic as the eccentric, but genius Lex Luthor. For anyone who's upset that he has a full head of hair, stay around till the end. Fifthly, Gal Gadot is effective as Wonder Woman due to her good looks and all-around athleticism (she's too tall and thin for my personal tastes, but she's great for the role of the Amazonian warrior princess).One annoying cavil is that CNN (Counterfeit News Network) obviously paid for constant advertising throughout the film. See 'Iron Man 2' (2010) for a superhero flick that knows how to present the news of the comic book world.BOTTOM LINE: This is a one-of-a-kind superhero film with numerous highlights, like the ultra-serious tone, the best depiction of Superman ever, an offbeat-but-magnetic Luthor, Affleck's great portrayal of Wayne/Batman and the inclusion of Wonder Woman. But the first half is bogged down by a lethargic story with too much fat. They coulda and shoulda stripped this down to a roughly two-hour flick. As it is, it can't compete with more kinetic superhero films like 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' (2015) and 'Captain America: Civil War' (2016).ADDITIONAL CAST MEMBERS: Amy Adams plays Lois Lane, Diane Lane & Kevin Costner appear as Clark's parents, Laurence Fishburne is on hand as Perry White, Holly Hunter plays a senator, Jeremy Irons appears as Alfred and cutie Rebecca Buller is on hand as Jenny, an employee at the Daily Planet.FILMING LOCATIONS: Detroit (Metropolis); Birmingham, Michigan; Chicago; Yorkville, Illinois (Smallville); East Los Angeles College, Monterey Park, California (Gotham vs Metropolis football game); Deming, New Mexico (Nairomi, Africa); and Washington DC.GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",6,1,4,30 November 2016
Tombstone," 'Tombstone' or 'Wyatt Earp'? How about BOTH
","Released in 1993 and directed/written by George Cosmatos, 'Tombstone' stars Kurt Russell & Val Kilmer as Wyatt Earp & Doc Holliday focusing on the infamous gunfight in Tombstone, Arizona, on October 26, 1881.This version of the story beat Kevin Costner's 'Wyatt Earp' to the theater by six months and stole its thunder. The difference in these two films is in their names: 'Tombstone' focuses on Earp's conflict with the 'Cowboys' gang in the Arizona town, whereas 'Wyatt Earp' is an epic Western detailing Earp's life from youth to old age, although the Tombstone events are certainly the center piece. At 2 hours and 10 minutes, 'Tombstone' runs an hour shorter than 'Wyatt Earp.' Both are top-of-the-line modern Westerns and whether you'll like one or the other depends on what you're in the mood for. If you're looking for a kinetic, mythmaking rendition of the tale then go with 'Tombstone.' However, if you want a more realistic, mundane account see 'Wyatt Earp.' Both are vastly superior to the talky 1957 version of the tale with Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.' I just saw both films back-to-back and it is fun comparing the two. Val Kilmer from 'Tombstone' wins out over Dennis Quaid as Doc Holiday, but not by much and not because Quaid is bad but rather because Holiday's role is more prominent in 'Tombstone' with better lines. Actually Kilmer is nothing less than fascinating, although Quaid is more believable. Kurt Russell and Costner are about even as Earp, but 'Tombstone' wins out overall in cast with Sam Elliott, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, Billy Zane and the shining Dana Delany as Josie, although Joanna Going shines just as much in the same role in 'Wyatt.' There are exceptions; for instance, Isabella Rossellini from 'Wyatt' edges out Joanna Pacula as Big Nose Kate.As for the dramatic walk to the O.K. Corral and the gunfight itself I favor 'Wyatt Earp,' but 'Tombstone' has a much better build-up to the confrontation. Unfortunately, 'Tombstone' spins its wheels in the last 35 minutes with redundant gunfights between Wyatt & his men and the remaining Cowboys. 'Wyatt Earp' maintains better momentum after the gunfight.'Tombstone' stands with the best Westerns of all time, but so does 'Wyatt Earp.' The film was shot in Arizona.GRADE: A- (8.5/10 Stars)",8,3,4,22 September 2016
Bruce Almighty," What would you do with God-like powers?
","Released in 2003, 'Bruce Almighty' chronicles what happens when God (Morgan Freeman) gives His powers to a complaining news anchor (Jim Carrey) and takes a vacation. Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's girlfriend and Steve Carell his rival anchor; Catherine Bell and Lisa Ann Walter are also on hand.In my opinion this is better than 1977's 'Oh God!' because Morgan Freeman is superior in the role of the Almighty. Plus, how can you go wrong with Jim Carrey? While the movie starts off rather dull it perks up as soon as Bruce (Carrey) acquires God's powers; and for a solid half hour there are loads of laughs. At the end of the second act, however, the movie sorta nosedives, but then recovers in the last act with some surprisingly moving and even inspiring material. The movie runs 101 minutes and was shot in Buffalo, New York City, San Diego and the Los Angeles area. GRADE: B",7,0,1,21 January 2016
Mr. Holland's Opus," Taking a bypass from your dreams and finding your true calling
","A composer (Richard Dreyfuss) puts his lofty ambitions on hold to become a high school music teacher in Portland, Oregon, from 1965-1995. Glenne Headly plays his wife, Jay Thomas the coach, Olympia Dukakis the principal and William H. Macy the irritating vice principal.'Mr. Holland's Opus' (1995) is a good school-oriented drama that's episodic in nature since it spans 30 years. The first 40 minutes were decent, but I was wondering if the film would be able to absorb me into its story, especially considering its considerable length. It did, particularly the episodes concerning Terrence Howard (playing Louis Russ) and angelic Jean Louisa Kelly (Rowena).The movie's kind of a meshing of 'Dead Poets Society' (1989) crossed with 'Forrest Gump' (1994), although not great like either of those flicks. But it's a solid drama. A 19 year-old Alicia Witt is on hand as one of the students in the first act.The film runs 2 hours, 23 minutes and was shot in Portland, Oregon, and nearby Marylhurst.GRADE: B",7,0,0,29 May 2019
Casino Royale," I didn't think Daniel Craig would cut it as Bond...
","...but his portrayal in this movie made me a believer. He's more rough-hewn than pretty boy Pierce Brosnan and more akin to Timothy Dalton, albeit without the smirk. In any event, Craig has the gravitas to pull-off the role with zero doubt, unlike Brosnan, who was cool, but he sometimes seemed to struggle in the role; Craig, by contrast, is utterly convincing.Let's face it, James Bond movies are not deep films. They may have convoluted plots, but there's little character depth and no heavy subtext commenting on the human condition. They're spy thrillers with an ultra-cool protagonist, beautiful women, spectacular locations, amazing gadgets, intrigue and action. That's it. Yet they're very entertaining, which is why the series has been such a hit since 1962 when 'Dr. No' was released.But, again, with the exception of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' (1969), there's very little, if any, character depth. Take James himself: Women to him are only meaningful as (1.) a sexual dalliance or (2.) a means to fulfill his mission. I mention this to point out that 'Casino Royale' (2006) boldly changes this. The film has character depth and shows why Bond is the way he is. For instance, there are a couple amazing conversations between James and his potential babe in the story, Vesper (Eva Green), and they're full of insights. The dialog is snappy & intriguing and the performances are right-on.By the way, someone complained that all the women in Bond flicks are loose and willing to sleep with any man at the drop of a hat. No, they're just willing to sleep with James Bond at the drop of a hat, lol. I'm not saying it's right, but it does reflect the exciting charisma of Mr. Bond.There are some cool action sequences, like the long, unrelenting chase after the title credits, but there are also some quality dramatic stretches. For instance, the main poker match at the casino is excellently staged and suspenseful.'Casino Royale' strikes me as a mixture of the first half of 'Goldfinger' with the serious tone of 'The Living Daylights' & 'Licence to Kill'. Don't expect the comic booky approach of 'You Only Live Twice' or the outlandish (and sometimes goofy) elements of 'Moonraker'.The film was shot in the Czech Republic, Venice, Bahamas and England and runs 144 minutes.GRADE: A-",8,0,2,9 October 2013
Signs," Is it really about aliens?
","M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' (2002) is about a disillusioned ex-minister (Mel Gibson) who lives in the country with his son & daughter and brother (Juaquin Phoenix). The reasons for his disillusionment become clear as the story unfolds. When a mysterious crop circle is discovered in their cornfield they wonder if it's a prank or an alien invasion!Although the plot deals with a possible alien invasion, the theme is faith. There are two general views of life: (1) That life and the universe are one big meaningless accident and you're just an insignificant bug that will soon be squashed out of existence and memory. And (2) that there's an intelligent design to the universe and, although it's somehow fallen (i.e. severely messed up), there IS meaning, love, hope and purpose, even if we are presently unable to fully comprehend it.The film addresses the clash of these two opposing views. We've all experienced the conflict of these two positions within our OWN hearts; it's the clash of flesh (id) and spirit (super-ego). On the one hand, we WANT to believe the latter position, but life dishes out so much crap that we are seriously tempted to give-in to the former.This is the struggle Gibson's character faces in the story. He's given up on God and is stumbling in the dark; he's just going through the motions to exist. His smile is mostly a facade.Many people diss the film for an obvious plot hole regarding the alien's weakness, but Shyamalan's too talented to not realize this. It's a sign to what the film is really about (sorry; I couldn't resist).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film)It's possible that the aliens aren't really extraterrestrials but rather demons from the underworld (the dark dimension) invading the physical realm to take as many victims as they can. The idea that they are aliens is just a mass deception and, remember, the devil is the 'father of lies'.There are many clues: The spaceships are never seen, just lights in the sky (the devil's also called 'the prince of the power of the air' in the bible). The 'aliens' look decidedly demonic and have cloven hoofs. The 'primitive method' of repelling the aliens is discovered in 'three cities the Middle East' and is holy water, which is ordinarily used by Catholic & Episcopal exorcists against demonic manifestations (Shyamalan, by the way, attended Catholic & Episcopal schools). The daughter, Bo, was said to be a 'gift from God' who is sensitive to impure (unholy) water. Her name in Old Norse means 'to live' and she was able to discern the weapon of life needed to defeat the demonic menace. The dog and bird were clearly possessed. The crop circles are occultic symbols and possible portals to the underworld. The crop circle in the Hess cornfield resembles a pitchfork. When the disillusioned minister cries out to God that he hates him he actually displays his faith; after all, he has to believe in God in order to converse. At that precise moment his son recovers from the asthma attack and the news announcer declares that the 'aliens' are retreating. You see, FAITH sends the enemy fleeing with their tails between their legs.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The 'alien' locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet and the minister after the death of the latter's wife.Also, we see evidence that the demons are personal in nature. The 'alien' locked in the vet's pantry was linked to the guilt and disillusionment that haunted the vet after the death of the minister's wife.Keep in mind that when the film debuted, Shyamalan was known as the king of the plot twist, yet the revelation that the aliens' weakness is water wasn't exactly a mind-blowing turn seeing as how the earth is 71% water and technologically advanced aliens who can travel the galaxy would know this. Moreover, the aliens curiously have no physical weapons and are easily trapped by a pantry door. It stands to reason that Shyamalan hid the twist in the movie. That twist is that the aliens are really demonic in nature.I'm not saying you can't view the movie as a literal extra-terrestrial invasion flick, but rather that the underlying demonic reading is a legitimate way of viewing the material because it all ties together and links to the story arc of the disillusioned ex-minister finding redemption. Also, I'm not suggesting that you have to believe in God to appreciate this movie, which is obviously not the case.BOTTOM LINE: This is a quality Shyamalan film and is about on par with 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Village.'The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Eastern Pennsylvania.GRADE: B+",7,1,4,27 October 2013
The Deer Hunter," Overrated and Depressing
","When I finally decided to catch this supposed classic war flick I was severely let down. There goes three hours of my life I'll never get back.The first hour consists largely of a tedious, never-ending wedding scene. The last hour involves scene after scene of people blowing their brains out in Russian roulette gambling games in Vietnam.Sandwiched between is the the grueling Vietnam torture sequence of POW's De Niro, Savage and Walkan. These scenes are well done and utterly unforgettable -- so much so that I never want to see them again.The overall impact is completely depressing. I have no idea how such a joyless, nihilistic work heralded so much praise. The movie was so overrated at the time that director Michael Cimino was unwisely given a blank check for 'Heaven's Gate,' which brought down the studio (though it's actually a quality Western).Only see this film if you want to be bored and see scene after scene of people blowing their brains out. See 'Apocalypse Now' (the original version, not 'Redux') if you REALLY want to catch a great 70's Vietnam War flick. If you want to see a worthwhile Cimino film check out 'Thunderbolt and Lightfoot' (1974).GRADE: C",5,3,8,12 March 2014
Beowulf," Entertaining and thought-provoking, even moving
","'Beowulf' is an animated 2007 film version of the epos featuring Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn. Although it's a 'cartoon' it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture with brutal violence and openly sexual situations & dialogue.The film has the same characters as the epic poem -- Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon -- and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's 'sea hag' mother and the dragon; other than this the film deviates from the poem. Needless to say, don't watch if you're a Beowulf purist.However, if you don't mind the animation or the re-imagining and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, you'll likely appreciate it. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching this version back-to-back with 2005's 'Beowulf & Grendel,' which is a live-action version with Gerard Butler and Sarah Polley, shot on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland.The message of this animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend because it has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero, but this isn't true. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't a hero, what is? Okay, so he exaggerates his past exploits and has a weakness for babes, what else is new?I should add here that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title ('What We Need Is A Hero') and the two versions of 'A Hero Comes Home' (the first is the shorter version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits).***SPOILER ALERT*** The rest of this review explores the meanings behind the story and gives away important plot elementsI'll be honest with you, although I was entertained the first time I saw 'Beowulf' I came away from it thinking 'Huh?' This version makes King Hrothgar the father of Grendel, and Beowulf the father of the dragon, making it absurd in a what-were-they-thinking way, but also creative. Viewing it a second time, I was intent on figuring it out and gleaning the moral(s) of the story. The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.Other points include:<ul><li>The mistakes of your past will inevitably come back to haunt you. </li></ul><ul><li>Apart from redemption, the 'sins of the fathers' will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally!). </li></ul><ul><li>Even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws. </li></ul><ul><li>Deal with your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt &amp; shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead. </li></ul><ul><li>Offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter the cost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak. </li></ul><ul><li>Men are easily entranced by a beautiful babe, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions. </li></ul><ul><li>A beautiful woman can turn a man into a loaf of bread. </li></ul><ul><li>The importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.</li></ul>Some things to think about: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is he able to morph back-and-forth at will? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?Some criticize that Beowulf is not a Christ-figure, which isn't accurate. Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only 'weeping martyrs,' ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer, who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in 'Beowulf' was created via Beowulf and is later revealed as a hideous dragon.All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even ultra-heroes like Beowulf, which -- again -- is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about 'weeping martyrs' is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement. Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, 'KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!' Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invulnerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending proves he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality, my friend. Who would have expected this in a 'cartoon'?",7,1,1,9 March 2014
Live Free or Die Hard," Big, dumb action flick delivers
","RELEASED IN 2007 and directed by Len Wiseman, 'Live Free or Die Hard' is the fourth installment in the Die Hard series. John McClane (Bruce Willis) is ordered to pick up a youth hacker (Justin Long) who's targeted by cyber-terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel and Mai Linh (Timothy Olyphant & Maggie Q). Their goal is to create chaos by taking over the USA's transportation grids and stock market. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays McClane's cute and feisty daughter while Kevin Smith has a small role as a computer geek living in his Mom's basement.Rigid fans complain that this sequel is 'Die Hard in name only' because I guess it deviates from formula but, really, the Die Hard series is ANY challenging adventure that John McClane experiences just as the 007 flicks consist of James Bond in differing challenges; same thing with Dirty Harry. In any case, 'Live Free or Die Hard' works as Die Hard sequel or as a stand-alone action flick with Bruce Willis. The story holds your attention while the action scenes are out of this world. They're so over-the-top that some write the movie off as absurd, but everything's done with a quasi-realistic tone so it helps the viewer go along with the ridiculous things that happen rather than tune out.'Live Free or Die Hard' is the natural progeny of over-the-top films like 1977's 'The Gauntlet' where the action scenes are so overdone they're cartoony, but entertaining. There's a thin line that filmmakers must tread with these kinds of blockbusters because they can easily fall into overKILL, like 2001's 'The Mummy Returns,' but 'Live Free or Die Hard' evades that ditch by giving us fairly interesting characters and a compelling story. It may not be great but it certainly fills the bill if you're in the mood for a wild action flick.I like the continuity of the series: McClane's wife (Bonnie Bedelia) is acknowledged here and we meet his daughter, now a hottie, and hear of his son, Jack. We learn of the severe price that John's bold, serious approach to his profession has had on his personal life. These things are further explored in 'A Good Day to Die Hard' (2013), which is basically just as good as this installment.THE MOVIE RUNS 128 minutes and was shot in Baltimore, Washington DC, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and other parts of Southern California.

X2: X-Men United," Has the most depth of the trilogy
","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant 'X' gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a 'Brotherhood of Mutants' with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - 'X-Men' (2000), 'X2: X-Men United' (2003) and 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006).'X2' is generally considered the best of the three and goes deeper into the conflict of Xavier's school, Magneto's Brotherhood and the US Government's increasing involvement, as laid out in 'X-Men.' More mutants are introduced. On Xavier's side: Nightcrawler, Colossus and Shadowcat. On the villain side: Lady Deathstrike and Government agent William Stryker.'X2' has the most depth and features numerous interesting character-defining moments along with great action scenes, like the one between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike near the end. There's also a particularly notable clash when Wolverine and others are forced to confront Federal agents as they storm Xavier's school. In other words, the US Government becomes the proverbial 'bad guys.' Take note how Wolverine shows no mercy.Unfortunately, the film overstays its welcome and goes on and on well after Wolverine's fight with Deathstrike, but I'm not complaining. I like the emphasis on character and the way the film eschews moronic 'blockbuster' conventions.GRADE: A-",8,4,7,10 April 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Entertaining sequel brings Asgard to life
","Released in 2013 and directed by Alan Taylor, 'Thor: The Dark World' stars Chris Hemsworth in his second solo movie as the Thunder God. Natalie Portman returns as an astrophysicist and Thor's earth babe, Jane Porter, who's infected by an eerie otherworldly substance called aether. After Thor brings Jane to Asgard, war breaks out when the dark elf, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), comes for the powerful substance.The Thor comic was unique in that the stories regularly involved three realms: the mythical Asgard and neighboring areas, uncharted expanses across the universe, and Earth. I rarely appreciated the Asgardian segments, but I often enjoyed the many creative cosmic explorations and the Earth-centered stories. Like the first movie, this sequel is amazing in that it successfully recreates Asgard and its main characters for the screen, not to mention that it actually makes them interesting (I never found Odin, Sif or the Warrior's Three interesting).The bulk of the movie takes place on Asgard and the sci-fi effects are just mind-blowing; I particularly like Malekith's spacecrafts and the Asgardian ship-crafts. Thankfully, there are some Earth sequences, including the dynamic climax in London. Bottom Line: This is a thrilling sequel; if you like the first movie you'll appreciate this one too.ADDITIONAL CAST: Anthony Hopkins appears as Odin, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Rene Russo as Frigga, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Jaimie Alexander as Sif, Zachary Levi as Fandral, Ray Stevenson as Volstaag, Tadanobu Asano as Hogan, Kat Dennings as Darcy and Stellan Skarsgård as Eric.The movie runs 112 minutes and was shot in England and Iceland, with additional studio work done in Manhattan Beach, California.GRADE: B+",7,1,1,9 December 2016
Lucy," Time to GROW UP
","'Lucy' (2014) is about an average hot babe named Lucy, played by Scarlett Johansson, who increasingly taps into her mind's full capacity and, consequently, acquires superhuman powers (or are they just fully-human powers?). She hooks up with the leading expert on the human mind (Morgan Freeman) to share her discoveries and also teams-up with a Paris police captain (Amr Waked) to destroy the malevolent schemes of an arrogant Asian mob boss (Min-sik Choi). It should be emphasized that this is not comic book superhero movie (Don't we have enough of those yet?), it's an ordinary-person-reaching-full-human-potential movie. There were two of these in the mid-90s, 'Powder' (1995) and 'Phenomenon' (1996). They're both good, but the latter played it too safe, particularly at the end, while 'Powder' reached for greatness and got a finger in. Francis Ford Coppola added his take on the genre with 2007's 'Youth Without Youth,' a dense film with many interesting elements; too bad he forgot to include a remotely entertaining story. 'Lucy' is the best of these and is, in fact, one of my all-time favorite movies. 'Lucy' includes the mindfood of Coppola's film, but doesn't forget to be entertaining. As such, the film mixes interesting, inspiring elements with thrills, action, eye candy and ear candy (a notable score). On top of this, 'Lucy' is stylish and 'hip,' whatever that means; in other words, it's got pizazz.Some complain that the film is flawed because it's based on the notion that we only use 10% of our brain power, but this is only a plot device to illustrate that most people are functioning way under their potential and are obsessed with usually worthless things and blowing precious time accordingly. Take, for instance, the people who blow hour upon hour of valuable time watching sports. Viewing a game here or there is great, but these types have lost all sense of moderation. Or how about those who feel they have to numb themselves with alcohol or drugs just to have a good time? They're, in essence, running away from reality. What's funny about this criticism that the film's based on humans only using 10% of their brain power is that, in most cases, the number's more like 1-2%. Lol, just kidding. (Or am I?) In regards to Lucy's powers illustrated in the film, and the other films noted above, I've had my own run-ins with such phenomena. For instance, about seven years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire or heat. The potent energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I awoke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition.Less spectacular is something that I experience every day with my wife: One of us will be thinking something and give voice to it and the other says, 'I was thinking the exact same thing.' What's going on? We're picking up each other's immaterial thoughts, otherwise known as telepathy. What if we developed this further? Other paranormal phenomena featured in the story include psychokinesis, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls 'the word of knowledge.' Although they're exaggerated in the film they're REAL.'Lucy' is inspiring in that it's an encouragement to GROW UP. As Lucy evolves she stops at her apartment and runs into her roommate, who's the typical bimbo party girl who spends too much of her free time 'partying' and pursuing a 'cute guy with nice buns' (or however she puts it). Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with these things, except that these people obsess over them and they become their PURPOSE for living. Whatever happened to 'All things in moderation'? The beginning of the movie shows that Lucy was just like her roommate but something happened and... she GREW UP.My praise of the movie's philosophical and theological ideas shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I agree with every jot and tittle. It's a sci-fi/thriller blockbuster, after all; it's just that this one has more interesting ideas than most. Secondly, who agrees with everyone about everything? Is that even healthy? The film doesn't wear out its welcome at a mere 89 minutes and was shot in Taiwan, France and a German airport.GRADE: ANeedless to say, I love 'Lucy'!",9,13,28,8 September 2014
Midway," Just the facts, Jack
","Intelligence officer Edwin Layton (Patrick Wilson) warns that a Japanese attack is imminent, but his advice is disregarded and the Japanese use their carrier fleet to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Chester Nimitz (Woody Harrelson) swiftly assumes command of the heavily weakened US Pacific Fleet. After the Doolittle air raid on Tokyo & Honshu 4.5 months later, events lead up to the Battle of Midway on June 4-7, 1942. Ed Skrein plays cocky pilot Dick Best while Dennis Quaid is on hand as carrier commander William 'Bull' Halsey.'Midway' (2019) tackles the Battle of Midway and events leading up to it without throwing in a dramatic fictional story, like the love triangle of 'Pearl Harbor' (2001). While I loved 'Pearl Harbor' and proudly stand by it, 'Midway' chooses to stick to the facts and is thrilling from beginning to end. The main cast members are all real-life figures and there's a tribute to each at the close.This is superior to the 1976 movie because Roland Emmerich had the CGI technology to pull off the battle scenes which take place in & above the Pacific Ocean near the atoll of Midway, which is located a little over a thousand miles west of Hawaii. The flick successfully takes the viewer right into the midst of the fight on the water, in the air and under the water. It's exciting, horrific and revelatory.The film runs almost 2 hours and 18 minutes.GRADE: A-",8,6,9,24 November 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Decent Star Wars flick highlighted by the return of iconic characters
","Released in early 2015, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' has J.J. Abrams replacing George Lucas at the helm as director/writer with the assistance of writers Lawrence Kasdan & Michael Arndt. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega star as the main protagonists, Rey and Finn, with Oscar Isaac on the side as a hotshot pilot. Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill return, the latter in a glorified cameo, along with Chewbacca, C-3P0 and even R2D2. There's a cute new droid called BB-8 and Adam Driver is on hand as the Darth Vader-like villain, Kylo Ren.I've only seen the original 1977 'Star Wars,' so I'm not the best person to appraise this installment, but – as a relative 'outsider' to the franchise – I was easily able to follow the characters & their story and was entertained enough to give this an okay rating. It's a fun space fantasy adventure highlighted by the iconic characters who are 38 years older. Daisy Ridley as Rey doesn't do much for me, however; I find her bland, albeit serviceable. Boyega and Isaac fare better as likable Finn and Poe. Driver plays a good villain, but he's too young for his high ranking in the First Order, although I'm sure being Darth's grandson made it possible.The best parts for me are the numerous awe-inspiring visuals and locations, Harrison Ford and BB-8. But these people who are claiming this is the best film ever made are guilty of serious overrating. At the end of the day it's flashy kiddie-oriented space fantasy with little meat on the bones and I have no desire to see it again. The film runs 135 minutes and was shot at Pinewood Studios, England, with location shooting done in New Mexico, Iceland, Ireland and Scotland.GRADE: C+",5,8,19,30 December 2015
Unbroken," Real-life cinema
","Released in 2014, 'Unbroken' chronicles the true-life story of Louie Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) who ran the 5000 meter race in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and later joined the US Army Air Corps for WWII. Upon crashing in the Pacific he and two others (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Witrock) must survive on a raft for almost seven weeks. When found by the Japanese they're placed in a POW camp and suffer the wrath of the commandant (Miyavi). Will they survive? Directed by Angelina Jolie and scripted (partly) by the Coen brothers and based on Zamperini's biography by Laura Hillenbrand, this is a totally realistic account of Louie's war-time trials and was a minor hit at the box office. What was it like being in the air on a bombing mission over Japan taking hits by nigh-suicidal Jap planes? What was it like to survive on a raft in the Pacific week after week? What was it like to live in a Japanese POW camp? 'Unbroken' shows you without amping-up the melodramatics and action. This explains why some viewers call it 'bland' and what have you. They're so used to 'Die Hard,' 'GI JOE' and 007 that movies that aim for real-life bore them. That said, I don't want to come off as a film snob because I DO understand their criticism. It just comes down to what you want out of a movie, real-life or blockbuster theatrics? So before watching this movie you have to psychologically prepare yourself for a film akin to other realistic war biographies, like 2002's 'The Pianist,' 2006' 'Rescue Dawn' and 2014's 'American Sniper.' If you want 'Spectre' you should skip 'Unbroken.' The movie is long enough as it is and therefore doesn't depict Louie's later PTSD and alcoholism or his Billy Graham-inspired reconciliation to God, although it mentions these things in the postscript. In any case, 'Unbroken' accomplishes precisely what it set out to do, put Louie's story to film for the world to see, and it does it very well. It may not be exceptional like 1957's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai,' but – being a biography – it never set out to compete with that film.The film runs 137 minutes and was shot in eastern Australia.GRADE: B+",7,1,2,4 November 2015
Final Destination," Innovative premise for a 'Dead Teenager Movie,' but the last act isn't compelling
","This first 'Final Destination' movie from 2000 was a rather innovative 'Dead Teenager Movie' in that the killer was Death itself, the Grim Reaper. A group of people escape a great tragedy due to a premonition of one of them and the rest of the movie involves the Grim Reaper systematically slaying those who cheated Death in various creative ways. The opening tragedy in this case is a plane crash; in the second film it's a horrible highway pile-up; in the third it's a roller-coaster mishap and so on.I've seen all five of the currently five-film franchise, but they each tell the same basic story with different characters and a different location and are all of the same high quality of filmmaking, technically speaking. Whether you prefer one or another depends on whether you like the cast and the death sequences (and the locations) because, other than these factors, they're all basically the same.This first one has a quality heroine or 'final girl' in Ali Larter. Amanda Detmer is also on hand as a fellow student while Kristen Cloke plays a freaked-out teacher. They coulda done better showcasing these women IMHO. On the opposite side of the gender spectrum there's Devon Sawa, Kerr Smith, Seann William Scott and Chad Donella. Their importance to the story is in that order. Meanwhile Tony Todd makes his first of four appearances in the series as a mortician who curiously knows more than he should.For me, what makes these movies kinda dull is the fact that it's impossible to cheat Death. Sure, you can escape it here or there, but Death's been in business for millennia and expertly knows what he's doing. As such, everyone's gonna die except maybe the 'final girl,' who will most certainly die in the sequel.The script began as an X-Files teleplay and, indeed, the movie was made by two veterans of that series. And you can tell due to the basic feel of the movie and the inclusion of two government agents. I'd give 'Final Destination' a higher grade because I love the concept, but this one curiously gets dull in the final act (despite all the 'exciting' things going on) and they coulda done more with the women.The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes and was shot in the Vancouver, British Columbia, area (although the events take place around New York City).GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",6,1,1,30 October 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out 'looks of love' for my tastes
","RELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry. While I'm a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I've never read Tokien, likely because I'm not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien's writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of 'Conan the Barbarian' (1982) and 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' (1991) with 'The Wizard of Oz' (1939) sounds good, then you'll probably like these movies more than me. 'The Return of the King' is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It's basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could've been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves. Like the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there's a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with 'The Two Towers,' there's excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you'll likely appreciate this installment more than me. There are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they're also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. Then there are WAY too many 'looks of love' between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There's also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one's fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché? Another problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There's Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit's wife. 'Mythica: A Quest for Heroes' (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did 'Conan the Barbarian' and 'Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God' (2005). It's not rocket science. As noted above, the movie's needlessly overlong and things could've been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and 'looks of love' are tacked on. Despite these honest quibbles, 'The Return of the King,' and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like. THE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. GRADE: C",5,2,4,11 March 2018
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Innovative teen slasher featuring Johnny Depp's debut
","Released in 1984, Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is about a psycho specter (Robert Englund) who haunts the dreams of four teens on Elm Street in Springwood, USA, with intent to kill. The four teens are played by Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp, Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia. John Saxon and Ronee Blakley play the parents of the heroine.I like the way 'Nightmare' takes the slasher genre and adds a new dimension—a ghostly killer who slays people in their dreams. I also appreciate how the story builds as it progresses; things aren't as simple as they seem in the first act. Speaking of which, the first act features an innovative murder sequence that takes place as a teen couple is locked in a bedroom. The horrific way a girl is shown 'climbing the walls' (or however you want to put it) didn't come into vogue until over a decade later with those Japanese ghost flicks. I also like how the hoodlum teen (Garcia) APPEARS to be the culprit when the viewer knows this isn't true.In addition, Heather is a quality protagonist and its interesting seeing Depp in his very first movie. It goes without saying that Freddy Krueger became a horror icon and deservedly so. Lastly, the ambiance of the movie is decidedly early-to-mid 80s, like the soundtrack and the (lame) electronic drums, but how can you hold that against the film? It's part of its charm. Nevertheless, I prefer the Friday the 13th flicks due to the camping-out locale and superior women.The movie runs 91 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & Venice, CA.GRADE: B+",7,0,1,15 June 2016

But he has to escape the 'agents' who are pursuing him (e.g. Hugo Weaving) to get to Morpheus. At which point his world is turned upside down and inside out. Marcus Chong and Joe Pantoliano are also on hand.'The Matrix' (1999) is a cerebral sci-fi/action film that mixes elements of the first two Terminator flicks (1984/1991) with martial arts action and a basic concept that hails back to 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' (1979) and no doubt further.To put this intricate movie together and make it entertaining took genius, so I give credit to the Waschowski Brothers, um, I mean sisters (rolling my eyes). The casting is great and Carrie-Anne is stunning throughout (I usually don't like short hair on women, but she's an exception). For me, though, the Waschowskis made it too comic booky.

Godzilla," More faithful and serious than the 1998 film, but not as entertaining
","The 1998 version of 'Godzilla' is lambasted to this day because it took too many liberties with the classic behemoth, but if you disregard these changes it's a great giant-creature-attacks-city flick. It was just serious enough, but with an amusing edge. combine that with an interesting cast, a great-looking monster and hundreds of little ones and you have a fabulously entertaining colossal-creature feature.The problem with the original Godzilla is that he's actually cute. Yes, he's 300-feet high, but he's cute. And that's the case in this 2014 version as well, but that's okay because he's on our side, I think.The plot revolves around Godzilla taking on a couple of like-size monsters called MUTOs ('Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms') and the destruction of one city after another in Japan, Hawaii and mainland America. While these fights don't occur until the second half of the movie, the CGI is great, as is the all-around filmmaking. There's nothing wrong on this front.It's the human characters and their story where the film is mediocre. Aaron Taylor-Johnson plays the main protagonist, Elizabeth Olsen his wife, and Bryan Cranston his father. Also on hand are Ken Watanabe, David Strathairn, Richard T. Jones and Sally Hawkins. These actors are all perfectly competent, but the story-as-written never makes 'em click as interesting characters. As such, they're bland. And, since the first half of the movie is focused on the build-up to the monsters, it's more boring than compelling.Still, it is Godzilla and there are some memorable disaster-oriented moments.The film runs 123 minutes and was shot in Honolulu, British Columbia and Nevada.GRADE: B-",6,0,2,10 October 2014
Hart's War," Like Hogan's Heroes but serious and quasi-realistic
","RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Gregory Hoblit, 'Hart's War' is a war flick about a paper-pushing lieutenant with a background in law (Colin Farrell) who is unexpectedly captured in Belgium and taken to a POW camp in southern Germany in the closing months of the European theater of the war. He eventually befriends and defends a Tuskegee Airmen (Terrence Howard). Marcel Iures plays the humane German commandant while Bruce Willis plays the tough-as-nails American colonel of the POWs. Cole Hauser is on hand as a racist soldier. This is obviously not a conventional WWII flick. Although it starts out with some great war action, it has more in common with films like 'Stalag 17' (1953) and 'The Great Escape' (1963), albeit with modern filmmaking craft. As my title blurb points out, it's reminiscent of Hogan's Heroes but without the comedy, plus elements of 'A Few Good Men' (1992). The film isn't really about survival in the POW camp, but rather the tensions of the prisoners and the criminal drama.Some have complained that no fascist camp colonel in his right mind would allow such a trial as depicted in the movie. But there are several reasons why the commandant would allow it: (1.) for entertainment, (2.) to witness and understand the American way, (3.) he knew the war would be over soon and wanted to have the Allie's favor, or (4.) a mixture of the above. Keep in mind that the commandant went to school in the US after the first world war so he was enamored by American lifestyle and had a fondness for jazz. I'm sure entertainment was a huge factor since POW camp life is just as boring for the captors as it is for the captives over time.The climax telegraphs that this is a war MOVIE and not real life, but it's packed with action and gripping drama. It's also ultimately quite moving. Although it failed at the box office, 'Hart's War' is a very good WWII POW camp movie and, in some ways, great.THE FILM RUNS 125 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic.GRADE: B+/A-",8,0,0,17 February 2013

","Released in 2016, 'Deadpool' stars Ryan Reynolds as a former Special Forces operative turned mercenary who is permanently scarred after undergoing a dubious operation, but is enhanced with accelerated healing powers. He adopts the alter ego Deadpool and, armed with his new abilities and a twisted sense of humor, hunts down the man who nearly destroyed his life. Morena Baccarin plays his potential babe while Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand are on hand as Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead.This is a creative, energetic and often funny parody of Marvel superhero movies highlighted by cutie Baccarin and an excellent portrayal of Colossus (of the X-Men); the X-teen is pretty cool too. Reynolds is outstanding as the protagonist, but Wade/Deadpool is the main problem with the movie. While there are glimpses of Wade's potential good side throughout, he's so foul-mouthed and vulgar it's hard to see. While consistently amusing, the movie's also a barrage against one's moral senses. I suppose this would be easier to overlook if you grew up in some sheethole where the dirtbag clientele cussed every other word peppered with nasty sexual-oriented verbiage.Don't get me wrong here, a couple of my favorite superheroes are radical antiheroes, like Wolverine and The Punisher, not to mention my favorite superhero flick is 2009's 'Watchmen,' which is hardly a goody-goody superhero movie. But 'Deadpool' is just so over-the-top foul & vulgar it becomes a turnoff after 15 minutes DESPITE its good humor and innovative filmmaking. The movie will no doubt be cited in chronicles on the decline of Western Civilization. That said, the message at the end is unexpected and good (I don't want to give it away, but it has to do with Deadpool's babe).Unfortunately, 'Deadpool' is so offensive and nasty it overshadows its attributes and I have no desire to see it again.

Samantha Womack and Sophie Cookson are on hand as Eggsy's mother and fellow recruit respectively while Hanna Alström plays a Swedish princess.Based on the 2012 comic series The Secret Service, 'Kingsman' basically meshes the X-Men with James Bond, adding its own creative, quirky approach. There's a lot of over-the-top and unbelievable action, but it is based on a comic, after all. The movie's eccentric and generally entertaining but marred by fluent F-bombs throughout and an unnecessarily vulgar scene, which tries to be funny (and almost is). (Keep in mind that I almost never comment on cussing in a movie unless it's so overdone it's distracting). If you like the X-Men or James Bond you'll want to check 'Kingsman' out, but it's not as good IMHO. The cast is great though and it is amusing; I'm sure the sequels will improve upon the foundation.The film runs 129 minutes and was shot in England, Toronto and Sydney, Australia.GRADE: C+ (5.5/10 Stars)",5,1,4,16 December 2015
Apollo 13," Cinematic account of the ill-fated Apollo mission
","In April, 1970, the Apollo 13 mission to the moon is aborted after an explosion causes internal damage. The three astronauts and Mission Control must now focus on merely surviving and getting back alive, if possible.Directed by Ron Howard, 'Apollo 13' (1995) is a solid account of the real-life events and obviously influenced 'The Martian' twenty years later, which is even better, albeit not based on historical events.I suppose this zeroes-in on the weakness of this movie: If you're familiar with the account you know how the story ends, which diminishes suspense. Nevertheless, I found it interesting to observe the living conditions and challenges of real-life astronauts, as well as the resolve and ingenuity of the people at Mission Control to work with what's available and to figure out how to get the astronauts home.The film runs 2 hours, 20 minutes. CAST: Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris and Kathleen Quinlan.GRADE: B/B-",6,0,0,14 June 2020
The Thin Red Line," Equal parts spiritual and horrifying
","Terrence Malick's 'The Thin Red Line' (1998) details the experiences of an American platoon during the battle of Guadalcanal in the SW Pacific during December/January 1942-43. The heart of the picture covers the taking of a grassy hill protected by Japanese bunkers; but that's only the surface of 'The Thin Red Line,' as this isn't a normal war flick in the least.The film features an all-star cast with cameos by the likes of John Travolta and George Clooney. Nick Nolte shines as the gung-ho Col. Tall, who wants to take the hill ASAP whatever the cost. This is his first war engagement and he lusts for glory. Meanwhile 'softhearted' Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas) resists sending his men on an obvious suicide mission and insists on a less-costly strategy to taking the hill.Some of the men are so defiled by the war that they can't feel anything anymore, for example Sgt. Storm, played by John Reilly, whereas a few haven't lost their spiritual bearings, like Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel); others are somewhere in between the darkness and the light, e.g. Sgt. Welsh (Sean Penn).Other standouts include Ben Chaplin as Pvt. Bell, who's dearly devoted to a wife who may or may not deserve it (Miranda Otto); Dash Mihok as the incredibly courageous Pfc. Doll, who wildly leads the way in taking the bunkers; and John Cusack as the bold Capt. Gaff, who's simply speechless in the face of Col. Tall's asinine antics.Other notables include Woody Harrelson, Adrien Brody, Jared Leto and Nick Stahl.COMMENTARY: As noted above, 'The Thin Red Line' is not a conventional war flick, so stay away if that's the type of movie you want to see. The battle of Guadalcanal is merely a stage for Malick to explore the nature of the human experience and, in fact, life itself. Why is nature at war with itself, from the smallest animals to people? Where does evil come from? What is love? Why do we feel it? Who is the Divine? What is the nature of the Creator? Why are we poisoned by war? What is death and why do we fear it? For that matter, why do we have to die? How can we keep from being defiled by strife and war? Malick shows both the beauty of the world and human existence as well as its horrors. We cannot change the way this world is and must therefore face the inevitable conflicts; the only thing we can control is our response to this ongoing war, like Caviezel's Pvt. Witt.As you can see, the film explores the noblest and darkest reaches of the human heart and experience. As such, it's a picture that keeps giving no matter how many times you've watched it. In other words, it's full of hidden gems to glean with each viewing.In contrast to the contemporaneous 'Saving Private Ryan,' 'The Thin Red Line' has a slow start with an uneventful beach landing; it also has a mellow ending, but the center's full of brutal war horror even while its heart is deeply meditative and reverent. If that sounds like a bunch of mumbo jumbo, see the film and you'll understand what I mean. In the end 'The Thin Red Line' towers alone in the annals of war cinema, a deeply spiritual triumph. There's really nothing else like it.FYI: The film was shot on location in Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, and Australia and runs 2 hours, 50 minutes.GRADE: A",9,1,2,29 May 2012

Fantastic Four," Good Film Depiction of the Fantastic Four
","I own FF comics from the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s. My first favorite comic as a kid was Fantastic Four; my favorite superhero was The Thing and my favorite villain was Doctor Doom. I was naturally looking forward to this film version.The casting is one of the highlights. I admit that I had my doubts regarding Jessica Alba as Sue Storm and especially Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards, but Alba does a fine job and Gruffudd was very much on the mark as 'Mr. Fantastic' (giggle). As for the Human Torch and The Thing, Chris Evans and Michael Chiklis are truly outstanding in their respective roles.What we have to understand is that the film is the ORIGIN story, so the characters are all relatively young here. Reed & Ben are probably only about thirty years old at this time (or slightly older), Sue is in her mid-twenties and Johnny is in his early twenties. Needless to say, don't expect to see a depiction of the Fantastic Four from issue #555! Some have also complained that The Thing is missing his notable rocky eyebrow but, once again, the story takes place when they first get their powers. Those of us who know our FF history know very well that he had no defining eyebrow back then. Only as he mutated over time did the eyebrow appear.What has always separated the Fantastic Four from other comic heroes is that they're a FAMILY; and all the character hallmarks of this family are wonderfully depicted in this film: Johnny & Ben's fighting, Hothead's likable show off-ness and arrogance, Reed's great intellect yet total lack of common-sense social skills, The Thing's grumbling struggle over being a monster and outcast, Reed's obsessive attempts to give The Thing back his humanity, as well as his attempts to restrain Ben when he has an understandable temper tantrum, Sue & Johnny's sister/brother bickering, etc.Other notable FF hallmarks are present as well: The Baxter Building, Victor Von Doom, Latveria and Ben's blind girlfriend Alicia Masters. Heck, even mailman Willie Lupkin is here, naturally played by FF creator Stan Lee. Also, Sue Storm's original hero moniker 'the Invisible GIRL' is even poked fun at.Doctor Doom is perhaps the greatest comics villain of all-time and they picked a very fitting actor for the role, Julian McMahon. As for the idea of linking Doom's origin with the FF members, I don't personally mind this, minor changes are naturally to be expected when changing mediums. Where they went wrong, however, was to fail to show Victor become truly scarred and hideous -- the very reason he came to create and wear the mask and armor. Yes, there was a little scarring but it wasn't enough.Doom's costume is hit-and-miss: the hood and mask look great but the rest of it deviates too far from his great costume in the comics. Still, this was an acceptable alteration.In the comics Doctor Doom had a definite diabolical charismatic presence that would give you goosebumps. There's a little bit of this feeling in the film but it's swept away when the good Doctor SPEAKS. Yes, when Doom talks his dialogue and voice are so wimpy and nonthreatening that it pretty much ruins the part. These missteps force me to lower my rating.Some criticize that the material isn't serious enough, and maybe the creators did go a little overboard here and there with a bit of zaniness, but the overall tone is serious. Make no mistake, although there is a lot of humor (which is an essential part of life), this is not a campy joke-fest. People must understand that the FF are a colorful, fun group of superheroes; they're not dark like Daredevil or Batman. Hence, the movie is a fun, colorful and brisk film, yet it remains essentially serious.One thing I fail to comprehend is the ridiculous bashing the film has received. 'Fantastic Four' is every bit as good as 'X-Men' which came out in 2000; both films are about the origin of a superhero team. Have we been so spoiled by the great superhero films since then (e.g. Spider-Man 1 & 2, X-Men 2, Daredevil Director's cut, Batman Begins, etc.) that we can no longer recognize or appreciate a fine comic film? If 'Fantastic Four' came out in 2000 before 'X-Men' it would have been deemed a superhero masterpiece.So many people rave about how great 'Spider-Man 2' is, and it is a well-done superhero film, but what about the stupid subplot regarding Peter losing his spider-powers because of his lack of confidence? Since when did Peter's spider-powers depend on his confidence? His powers were derived from a radioactive spider bite; hence, his powers would not come-and-go depending on his confidence level! I'm just pointing out that, as good as 'Spider-Man 2' is, it is not without its flaws.BOTTOM LINE: This is a good and fun film version of the Fantastic Four. The missteps with Doctor Doom are its only real shortcomings. If you like or love the Fantastic four, or just have a casual interest in them, you'll likely enjoy it. If not, why are you reading this?GRADE: B",7,3,5,11 March 2014
Jackie Brown," Character-driven crime drama with Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Forster
","RELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, 'Jackie Brown' is a crime drama about a middle-aged flight attendant, the eponymous Brown (Pam Grier), who smuggles huge sums of cash from Mexico to L.A. for a too-cool arms dealer, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson). When she's caught by two agents (Michael Keaton & Michael Bowen) they propose a deal to apprehend the dealer in exchange for her freedom. In the meantime Ordell enlists an aging bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster), to release her with the aim of eradicating her. Brown knows Ordell's wicked intentions and devises a plan to not only survive the life-or-death situation, but come out the richer for it. Bridget Fonda plays Ordell's hot white babe and Robert De Niro his fresh-out-of-prison pal.This is Tarantino's most realistic film, so don't expect his typical cartoonish-ness and buckets of blood. There are occasional flashes of violence, but this is mostly a talk-driven drama. Interesting dialogues have always been one of Tarantino's strengths and so it is here. Grier is a distinguished protagonist while Fonda is smoking in her Daisy Dukes. De Niro's character is in a post-prison stupor, but you know he's still very formidable, which one character is too dull to realize. Bottom Line: 'Jackie Brown' may not be as eventful as 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) or 'Django Unchained' (2012), but it's a very good crime drama and unique in Tarantino's oeuvre. THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours & 34 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area (e.g. Venice Beach, Carson, Torrance, Compton, Carson & Hawthorne). WRITERS: Tarantino wrote the script based on Elmore Leonard's 1992 novel 'Rum Punch' (the only film he wrote based on a previous work). GRADE: B+",7,0,3,9 February 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," A slasher flick with a creative twist and over-the-top climax
","Released in 2012 and directed by Drew Goddard, 'The Cabin in the Woods' is a slasher flick with satirical elements about five youths who take a getaway to a, you guessed it, cabin in the woods. Everything's not as it appears, however, and total havoc ensues.Right off the bat, the movie gives away the fact that something is going on behind the scenes with the cabin, as if the kids are being set-up for some diabolical purpose. I liked the cast and the movie was decent, but I was a little turned-off by the set-up angle, which I'll leave for you to discover. I just prefer more straight-forward storytelling. But the ridiculously over-the-top climax won my respect because there's no way I would've predicted what was really going on and the motive thereof. So the movie gets points for creativity.While 'Cabin in the Woods' is somewhat satirical, it's not a horror comedy. It comes across as one of the Friday the 13th sequels with some Scooby-Doo elements thrown in. Chris Hemsworth plays the alpha male, Anna Hutchison the (too thin) blond hottie, Jesse Williams the studious dude, Fran Kranz the burnout and Kristen Connolly the virginal main protagonist (the true hottie). Amy Acker and Sigourney Weaver have peripheral roles. The filmmakers should've taken advantage of Amy's magnificent presence, but they failed. The movie runs 95 minutes and was shot in British Columbia.GRADE: B",7,0,2,13 August 2016
Windtalkers," Imagine 'The Thin Red Line' if it were more conventional
","'Windtalkers' (2002) stars Nicolas Cage as a follow-the-orders-at-all-costs soldier who's assigned to protect a code talker (Adam Beach), a Navajo who speaks his native language on radio transmissions to conceal the data from the Japanese. Christian Slater plays a similar soldier assigned to another Navajo (Roger Willie). The movie details the Battle of Saipan and also stars Noah Emmerich, Mark Ruffalo, Brian Van Holt, Peter Stormare and Frances O'Connor.I was surprised by how good 'Windtalkers' is. I say 'surprised' because it lacks the mass hoopla surrounding other WWII films, like 1998's overrated 'Saving Private Ryan' (don't get me wrong, the first act of 'Ryan' is great, but the rest of the movie leaves a lot to be desired. Remember the lame dog tag sequence?). The film was made by John Woo who knows how to make an exciting and colorful action flick, as witnessed by 1996' 'Broken Arrow.' 'Windtalkers' cost a whopping $115 million to make and you definitely see it on the screen; unfortunately, it 'only' made back $75 million worldwide.Both 1998's 'The Thin Red Line' and 'Windtalkers' involve the Pacific Theater of WWII and the taking of Japanese-held islands. While I consider 'The Thin Red Line' a nigh-masterpiece, it's too meditative and spiritual if you're in the mood for a straight war flick. When that's the case, 'Windtalkers' satisfies just fine. Remember the incredible air raid sequence in 1979's 'Apocalypse Now'? That's the impression I got with the opening scenes of the Battle of Saipan in 'Windtalkers.' Some complain that not enough emphasis is put on the code talkers, but the two Navajos are major characters throughout the story, particularly the one played by Beach. As for their actual code-talking, what else needs to be shown? The complaint holds no water.Others complain about the utter annihilation of throngs of Japanese soldiers, but the statistics support this: There were 71,000 allied forces and 31,000 Japanese soldiers in the battle. 'Only' 3,426 allied forces died, while another 10,000 were wounded, but 24,000 Japs were killed and another 5000 committed suicide, while 921 were taken captive. On top of this 22,000 civilians died, mostly by suicide, in obedience to the imperial order of Emperor Hirohito encouraging the civilians of Saipan to commit suicide promising them an equal status in the afterlife with that of soldiers dying in battle.Ultimately, 'Windtalkers' lacks that special flair or perspective that denotes truly exception war movies, like 'Apocalypse Now,' 'Platoon,' 'Where Eagles Dare' and 'The Blue Max,' but 'Windtalkers' isn't far behind. The main difference is that it's more of a conventional war flick but, of course, that's all it needs to be.The film runs 134 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and the greater Los Angeles area.GRADE: B+",7,6,9,18 April 2015
Braveheart," Starts meh, gets good for 90 minutes, and then loses its mojo in the last hour
","RELEASED IN 1995 and directed by Mel Gibson, 'Braveheart' chronicles the life of Scotsman William Wallace (Mel Gibson) from his youth in 1280 to his execution in 1305 and events shortly thereafter. Parts of the First War of Scottish Independence are depicted, like the Battle of Stirling Bridge, the Battle of Falkirk, as well as Wallace's betrayal, capture and execution.The film is notorious for its inaccuracies. For instance: (1.) kilts did not become a popular form of men's wear in Scotland until almost 400 years later. (2.) The first night or Primae Noctis wherein English nobles had the privilege of sleeping with Sottish brides is considered a historical urban myth by most historians. While there are plenty of writings that allude to it, there's very little legitimate evidence that it was ever actually used by any nobles anywhere. (3.) Scots at the time of Wallace didn't paint their faces for battle, although the Picts did wear blue face paint to scare off the Romans centuries earlier. (4.) We see no bridge at the Battle of Sterling Bridge in the movie. In the real battle the English had to cross a small bridge to attack the Scottish, but the bridge only allowed for three cavalrymen to cross at a time, which Wallace's men took advantage of, immediately killing the English once they made it to the other side.(5.) Princess Isabelle of France (Sophie Marceau) was actually only 3-4 years old during Wallace's military campaigns and, in fact, never met Wallace. (6.) Although it's one of the best scenes in the movie, Phillip was never defenestrated (thrown out a high window), but lived long after Longshanks' death. However, it is likely true that wimpy Prince Edward II had homosexual affairs, although he fathered as many as five children. (7.) While Longshanks was present at the Battle of Falkirk and was known for using Irish & Welsh conscripts, at no point did the Scots and Irish stop in the middle of battle to shake hands. Also Edward I (aka Longshanks) never told his archers to fire blindly into the mêlée of English and Scots. (8.) Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen) never betrayed Wallace, although he initially disowned him publicly, he secretly supported his war effort and openly admitted it later.Despite these inaccuracies, the gist of the tale is true: William Wallace existed. He fought a battle with the English at Stirling and won. He fought another battle with the English at Falkirk, but was betrayed and lost. He was deceived and captured by the English, taken to London and excruciatingly executed (although it was even worse in real life than in the film). Wallace's rebellion set Scotland on the road to freedom.About half the movie makes it worth seeing: It starts weak for the first 25 minutes or so, gets good for the next hour and a half and then inexplicably loses its mojo in the last hour. The problems in the last hour include: the story losing its drive, the eye-rolling betrayal scene; the equally eye-rolling episode where Wallace rides into a noble's bed chamber on a freakin' horse and easily escapes (Why Sure!); and, lastly, the overlong and dull execution sequence wherein the Christ symbolism is laid on too thick.Highlights, beyond those already noted, include Gibson in the title role (speaking as someone who's not even a fan), the magnificent locations, Wallace's initial rebellion, Patrick McGoohan's delightfully diabolic portrayal of the pompous Longshanks, the brutal fight sequences and the moving score by James Horner.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 minutes shy of 3 hours and was shot in Scotland & Ireland with the impaling of the horses sequences shot in Arizona.

Jackson, Val Kilmer, Brad Pitt, Bronson Pinchotand and Saul Rubinek.'True Romance' (1993) is a crime drama/thriller/romance and black comedy directed by Tony Scott (younger brother of Ridley) and written by Quentin Tarantino. The latter sold the script to fund his first movie 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992). It contains the ultra-violence/gore that Tarantino is known for, along with his satirical, comic book style that makes it more amusing than shocking.While the all-star cast is incredible and there are several great scenes, something keeps 'True Romance' from the top tier of 'Pulp Fiction' (1994) and 'Jackie Brown' (1997). I suppose it doesn't help that the protagonist's sudden transformation isn't convincing, not to mention that what he does is unnecessary and perilous (i.e. stupid), which turns him into a bit of a creepy nutzoid. But that's just me.Imagine being blown away by the greatest album by a band and then purchasing their previous album, which is good, but not in the same league. You like it, but you're also a little letdown. That's how 'True Romance' comes across after viewing 'Pulp Fiction.' Nevertheless, it's still worthwhile if you don't mind this genre.The script was originally written in a nonlinear structure, which Tarantino is known for, but Tony Scott changed the story to chronological, as well as altered the ending, which made for a morally confused message.

Madhur Mittal appears as Jamal's brother, Salim, who resorts to crime while Freida Pinto plays, Latika, the girl Jamal loves.If you're not used to the horrors of overpopulation and poverty in modern India you're in for a culture shock as this movie shows India in all its glory and shame. A friend of mine lives in Hyderabad and he regularly sends me pics of orphaned kids living on garbage, etc., just like in the movie; of course he does his small part to try to save them.The big question of the film is: How does Jamal, a teen who grew up in one of the worst slums on earth, possibly know the answers to the questions on the TV show?

Hacksaw Ridge," Tribute to a real-life WW2 'conscientious collaborator'
","After Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss' potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant.Based on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, 'Hacksaw Ridge' (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and 'Hacksaw Ridge' is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroic element too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding 'Platoon' (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.The movie's about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn't. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ' instructions to 'turn the cheek' related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: 'A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult' (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn't referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one's nation.For proof, Jesus' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren't absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple - throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don't inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They're wrong. Sometimes it's necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.The film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.GRADE: B-",6,1,2,1 December 2019
The Runaways," 'That's what you do—you sing and you strut around in your underwear'
","Released in 2010, 'The Runaways' chronicles the quick rise and fall of all-girl rock band The Runaways who released four albums from 1976-1978. I mean 'girl' literally since they WERE girls at the time; for instance, when the band was formed in late 1975 singer Cherie Currie just turned 16 years-old. The movie is lightly based on Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway and therefore focuses on the friendship of Cherie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and their relationship with their eccentric manager Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon). Riley Keough plays Cherie's 'better looking' sister while Scout Taylor-Compton and Stella Maeve play band members Lita Ford and Sandy West.The Runaways had some brief success in the late 70s, but they quickly nosedived because they were teenagers and simply couldn't handle the pressures and temptations of the 70's rock 'n' roll lifestyle, particularly Cherie. The movie successfully illustrates this. Of course 'Cherry Bomb' was a fairly well known song but, beyond this, they just weren't that popular. They were a here-today-gone-tomorrow act; a minor blip in rock history. You could say they were a good 'farm band' for the more popular Joan Jett and Lita Ford. Speaking of the latter, Scout Taylor-Compton looks uncannily like her, but the character is given short shrift in favor of Jett and Currie. While this is understandable given that the movie was based on Currie's book and the short 96-minute runtime, there's no excuse for ignoring Lita at the end when the movie cites what the characters went on to accomplish. Since Ford was the second most successful Runaway in the music business, second only to Jett, this is inexcusable.Despite this grave transgression, the movie works because of the great performances of the principle actors. Shannon is particularly effective as the freakish Fowley (who passed away in 2015 at the age of 75). Unfortunately, with a movie that's only an hour and a half long they can only tell so much of the story. Currie described the real story as epic and that the movie is just a 'lighter kind of flash' of what The Runaways were for two and a half years. Being a 70's rock biopic of teenage girls you can expect the sex & drugs elements with profanity, crudeness and a dismal pall. Like 1991's 'The Doors,' the movie doesn't show much of the fun side of rock 'n' roll.If you can look beyond the vulgarity and ugliness, however, the movie has (some) heart. For instance, the genuine friendship of Jett and Currie, which can be observed in the phone call at the end; and the loving relationship of Cherie and her sister Marie. The sisters went on to record a couple albums together – 1978's BEAUTY'S ONLY SKIN DEEP and 1980's MESSIN' WITH THE BOYS – but their music career failed to go further due to Cherie's problems with drug dependency.I liked this movie better the second time I watched it. It's too crude and dreary for my tastes and it lags here and there, but it makes up for it with effective performances and the warm relationships noted above. Plus it has a rockin' soundtrack. If you watch recent interviews, you'll observe that Lita and Cherie grew up to be palpably honorable, beautiful women. Joan's cool too, of course; she's just not my cup of java, although I like some of her songs. The film was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",6,2,3,22 January 2016
The Breakfast Club," Forced, artificial dialogs with eye-rolling character arcs
","Released in 1985 and written & directed by John Hughes, 'The Breakfast Club' is a teen dramedy about five high school students from five different sub-cultures during an all-day detention over the weekend at their suburban Chicago school. Molly Ringwald plays the popular girl, Emilio Estevez the jock, Anthony Michael Hall the Brainiac nerd, Judd Nelson the dope-smoking rebel and Ally Sheedy the neurotic misfit. Paul Gleason and John Kapelos are on hand as the host principal and janitor respectively This movie has a big reputation as an 80's teen flick, but I was wholly disappointed. Most of the discussions between the five students from different cliques come across contrived and unconvincing. Some of the dialog is actually cringe-inducing. The hoodlum could've worked as a character, like the Fonz or Vinnie Barbarino, but he's such an annoying, loud-mouthed jerk that he loses all sympathy, particularly when he verbally rapes the redhead on multiple occasions for no ostensible reason. *** SPOILER ALERT*** The fact that the two end up together at the end adds insult to injury. ***END SPOILER*** Not to mention two others that unrealistically couple up. It's strange that 'The Breakfast Club' is billed as a comedy because there's very little that's funny, although it's occasionally entertaining, like some of the music sequences. Unfortunately, Hughes wasn't into the heavier side of rock and so the soundtrack consists solely of bland 80's new wave bands, like his other 80's teen flicks (e.g. 'Sixteen Candles,' 'Pretty in Pink' and 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'). Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of quality songs, like 'We Are Not Alone' by Karla DeVito, but where are the heavier popular bands of 1984, like Van Halen, Scorpions, Judas Priest, Ratt, Dokken, Queensryche, Def Leppard, AC/DC or Motley Crue? Is it asking too much to have ONE song that actually rocks?But the music is the least of the movie's problems (and isn't really a problem at all, except that there aren't any heavy tracks). The actors are fine, but Hughes' dialog is unconvincing. As such, you don't buy the characters. The script needed a serious rewrite. The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in the suburbs north of Chicago. GRADE: C-",4,2,4,1 March 2017
Gladiator," What was it like to be a gladiator?
","Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' (2000) takes place in 180 AD and begins with a decisive Roman victory led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) over the Germanic tribes in what is now Austria. The Emperor (Richard Harris) is dying and wants to turn over control of the empire to the noble Maximus rather than his pathetic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus catches wind of this, Maximus and his family are condemned, but the general survives and winds up a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed), who trains gladiators. Connie Nielsen is on hand as Commodus' sister who sympathizes with Maximus.I saw 'Gladiator' in the theater when it came out. It was over-hyped at the time and, as a result, I was let down, which isn't to say it's bad—not at all—it's just not as great as the hoopla made it out to be. Maybe I was a little disappointed because it's hard to watch 'Gladiator' without comparing it to 1960's 'Spartacus,' the first hour of which represents some of the greatest filmmaking ever, and 'Gladiator' is underwhelming by comparison (with the first hour anyway).Yet 'Gladiator' has a lot of strengths, including the serious tone, the score, locations, the recreation of the Colosseum in Rome and the cast. Speaking of the cast, Crowe is probably the film's greatest strength as he makes a worthy protagonist; and Reed is no slouch as he's his typical magnetic self. Believe it or not, Reed died during filming and his remaining scenes had to have his face superimposed over an anonymous actor (!). Maximus' fellow gladiators and friends are also notable (Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller). Furthermore, the arena action sequences are thrilling and indeed give you a glimpse of what it must've been like to be a gladiator.Phoenix is also exceptional as the love-to-loathe villain, but this is where the film suffers. Commodus (obviously derived from 'commode,' lol) is so repugnant and dishonorable that the viewer has no interest in watching overlong dramatic sequences of him in the palace, etc. These scenes could've easily been cut in half.While 'Gladiator' has a simplistic revenge plot there's some depth to glean here and there. For instance, the Emperor (Harris) chooses Maximus to replace him not only because he loves him as a son, but also because he wants someone outside of the corruption of Roman government to return the empire to a republic. That's what we need in the USA, someone not tainted by Washington politics. Then there's Commodus' sister, Lucilla (Nielsen), who initially comes off ignoble, but then you start to understand her plight and sorta hope she's redeemable.As far as historical accuracy goes (***SPOILERS***), Marcus Aurelius allowed his unworthy son, Commodus, to become Emperor, knowing his incompetence BUT it is believed Aurelius wanted Claudius Pompeianus to succeed him as Caesar in preference to Commodus but was turned down, just as Maximus turned him down in the film. The fictional character of Maximus was partially based on Pompeianus, who had a similar career to Maximus' and personality traits as well, as documented by Herodian. In fact, Pompeianus married Marcus Aurelius' daughter, Lucilla, following the death of Lucius Verus. Maximus was also an amalgam of historical people like Narcissus (which was the protagonist's name in the first draft and Commodus' real-life killer), Spartacus (who, of course, led a significant slave revolt), Cincinnatus (a farmer who saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month ruler-ship after 15 days), and Marcus Nonius Macrinus (a faithful general and friend of Marcus Aurelius). As for Commodus' entering the arena at the end and taking on a mighty (albeit wounded) gladiator and dying, Commodus was known to engage in show combat in the Colosseum, but he was actually strangled by the wrestler Narcissus in his bath, not killed in the arena, and he ruled for a dozen plus years, unlike the relatively short time shown in the movie.Say what you will about these (common) cinematic deviations, but the movie does inspire you to look-up the historical facts. The film runs 155 minutes (the extended cut 171 minutes) and was shot in England (the opening battle scenes), Malta, Morocco, Tuscany and Lone Pine, CA.GRADE: B-",6,1,4,13 November 2014
Contact," Science and religion in wedded bliss
","If you can imagine 'Armageddon' without the action you'd have a pretty good idea of 'Contact.' Perhaps this is because they both hail from the late 90s ('Contact' came out the summer of '97 and 'Armageddon' a year later). Toss in some elements of 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' and -- voilà -- you have 'Contact.' Not that it doesn't possess its own uniqueness, of course.The story has to do with an astronomer (Jodie Foster) finding conclusive radio evidence of extraterrestrial life. The intelligence -- whatever it is -- then sends data on how to meet, but only one person can go.Foster's character is an atheistic scientist while her romantic interest in the story believes in God (Matthew McConaughey). The respectful tension of these two mindsets in the face of extraterrestrial contact is interesting and the filmmakers do a good job of maintaining a balance between the two, rather than advocating one above the other. Generally speaking, science and religion both pursue truth (the way it really is) but their methods differ, science stresses empirical evidence whereas religion looks to faith and love. Why can't we embrace both? (What a revolutionary idea!)Both vantage points are portrayed by people who are genuine and honest about their pursuit of truth. Between them is the character of David Drumlin (played excellently by Tom Skerritt) who is driven by selfish ambition and therefore willing to put on airs to attain his goals. But corruption comes at a price.The film is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name. The balance in the film between fact and faith, atheism and belief can be attributed to Sagan's spiritual agnosticism. He rejected the arrogance of atheism and has stated: 'Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.' Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries. The movie conveys this.The film runs two and a half hours.GRADE: B",7,0,2,20 February 2013
Donnie Darko," Cult flick with sophisticated themes, great cast, but meh story
","Released in 2001 and written/directed by Richard Kelly, 'Donnie Darko' is a drama/fantasy starring Jake Gyllenhaal as a troubled California teen dogged by apparitions of a man in an evil rabbit suit who manipulates him to commit several crimes, after he narrowly escapes a peculiar accident concerning a jet engine falling from the sky. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays his sister, Holmes Osborne & Mary McDonnell his parents, Drew Barrymore his teacher, Katharine Ross his therapist, Jena Malone his girlfriend, Noah Wyle his science teacher and Patrick Swayze a self-help guru. Patience Cleveland is on hand as Grandma Death.While the movie flopped at the box office, it has since become a serious cult hit. I saw it recently for the first time and went into it cold without knowing anything about the intricacies behind the plot. The only thing I knew was that the kid was harassed by an ee-vil bunny apparition. The film mildly works as a high school drama with a satirical smirk. But the story's just not engaging enough on that level. While the movie has some quality women, it fails to capitalize on their presence (Barrymore, for instance, is barely in it). But Jake is a solid protagonist, even somewhat sympathetic despite the curious things he does.By the middle of the second act I found myself getting bored with the story and trying to figure out what was going on, but the film perks up in the last act, particularly when it reveals the truth about the scary bunny guy. After viewing, my overall impression was that the story never really took off and was burdened by perplexing ambiguities even while possessing some fascinating elements. I came up with a theory to explain the events (explained below) but, upon reflection, I realized that all the pieces didn't fit. And the movie simply wasn't entertaining enough to bang my head further trying to figure it out. I would've given the movie a mediocre 5/10 rating, but after investigating the official meaning and the alternative explanations I had to admit that the film is genius in this respect. It just needed to be attached to a more interesting story with more stimulating characters.The film runs 113 minutes, which is the version I saw; the Director's Cut runs 20 minutes longer. It was shot in Los Angeles and surrounding areas (Angeles National Forest, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Santa Clarita, Burbank & Calabasas).GRADE: B- ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY (*** SPOILER ALERT***Don't read unless you've seen the movie): My casual interpretation turned out to be one of the alternative explanations of the movie, the so-called 'Donnie Is Shown the Future' explanation, which suggests that Donne is shown the future via the future ghost of Frank and so he sacrifices himself at the end to save everyone. But, as noted above, there are too many holes in this interpretation.A couple of other popular explanations are the banal Schizophrenia Theory, where the film shows the protagonist going through an episode of his illness, and the Dream Theory, where it was 'all just a dream,' which is too clichéd and idiotic to even consider.The 'official' interpretation I would've never pieced together because it's just too sci-fi-oriented and complex: It's the Tangent Universe Theory, which suggests that time in the Primary Universe (i.e. reality) is occasionally corrupted and an unstable alternative universe is created, but it will only last a few weeks. Nevertheless, it threatens to destroy the universe. The events you see happening in the bulk of the film are this alternative reality where the universe (or God) is correcting the error to get back to the Primary Universe using an Artifact (the jet engine), The Living Receiver (Jake Gyllenhaal), a Manipulated Dead person (the bunny guy), and so on. Google it and you'll see that the Tangent Universe explanation ties up all the loose ends.",6,0,1,9 April 2017
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Second-rate compared to 'Raiders,' but still entertaining in ways
","RELEASED IN 1989 and directed by Steven Spielberg, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' has Jones (Harrison Ford) globetrotting for the Holy Grail and, along the way, teaming up with his father (Sean Connery). Alison Doody plays an Austrian colleague of the latter.After the cartoony farce of 'Temple of Doom' (1984), Spielberg went back to the blueprint of 'Raiders of the Last Ark' (1981) to make this third film in the franchise. The problem is that, while good in many ways, 'Last Crusade' is second-rate by comparison. 'Raiders' copped the perfect tone for this kind of adventure flick: Quasi-realistic with a fun, kinetic edge. As wild as the actions scenes in 'Raiders' were, most of them were later reenacted on a TV show in order to see if they were plausible, and they were! Unfortunately, 'Last Crusade' mixed the plot of 'Raiders' with the silliness of 'Temple' and so many of the action sequences smack more of a cartoon than reality. The escape from the zeppelin in the parasite biplane is a good example. Then there's the silly bickering and bumbling of father and son, like when they're tied-up in the castle or facing the Nazis in (what is now) Turkey.Thankfully, there are eventually some good scenes between the two, which shed insight on them and their troubled relationship. And the globetrotting is great, starting with Arches National Park, then Venice, an Austrian-German castle, Berlin and Turkey. While cartoony and second-rate (compared to 'Raiders'), the action sequences are often fun and thrilling. And the striking Doody is fine on the female front. Some critics wrote her character off as a 'blonde bimbo,' but this is inexplicable seeing as how she's palpably intelligent and sophisticated. Regrettably, the climax is overlong and curiously dull despite its attempt at spiritual profoundness.THE MOVIE RUNS 127 minutes and was shot in Arches National Park, Utah; Hertfordshire, England; Venice, Italy; Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany; London & other places in England; numerous locations in Spain; Colorado; Amarillo, Texas; New Mexico; and Petra, Jordan.

Christopher Lloyd plays the quirky Doc Brown while Thomas F. Wilson plays the villain, Biff. Claudia Wells is on hand as Marty's girlfriend.This is a clever, fun and insightful fantasy that addresses the power of decision at critical turning points in life.

Goodfellas," Scorsese's snappy, hip Mafia flick with Ray Liotta, De Niro, Joe Pesci and Paul Sorvino
","RELEASED IN 1990 and directed by Martin Scorsese, 'Goodfellas' tells the true story of Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his life through his teen years in the late 50s through his years in the Mob in the 60s-80s, covering his relationships with his wife (Lorraine Bracco), his mistress (Gina Mastrogiacomo), his Boss (Paul Sorvino) and his partners Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) & Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) in the Italian-American crime syndicate in the New York City area.I'm not big on mob movies, but I have to admit that 'Goodfellas' is consistently entertaining and delivers a potent message on misguided loyalties, greed and the folly of getting involved in organized crime regardless of its 'great perks.' In the long run it ain't worth it. I couldn't wait till the arrogant little POS Tommy (Pesci) bought the farm. The feminine cast is rounded out by Debi Mazar and Welker White. Even Samuel L.

The Birds," Reacquaint with 'The Birds'
","Hitchcock's 1963 drama/horror/thriller 'The Birds' details the story of a city woman (Tippi Hedren) going to the rural coastal town Bodega Bay to play a coquettish prank on a lawyer whom she met in San Francisco (Rod Taylor). As she starts to get to know the town the birds mysteriously attack in force. 'The Birds' might well be the first official nature-runs-amok flick, which were made hugely popular a dozen years later with the release of 'Jaws,' the film that opened the Pandora's box to creatures-on-the-loose flicks. I believe 'The Birds' should be enjoyed at face value as a simple story of birds mysteriously attacking a coastal hamlet, but a more allegorical interpretation is that Melanie (Hedren) represents modern ideas that attempt to infect the rural communities where people live and think in a simpler, more conservative way. The village is not ready to accept and incorporate these 'new' concepts and so nature itself attempts to vomit out the infection, irregardless of hometown damage and casualties. Yet this interpretation seems to be rejected by the film itself in the restaurant scene where the mother with two kids hysterically rebukes Melanie for supposedly causing the bird attacks; when Melanie slaps the mother, this irrational notion is 'slapped' out of the viewer as well, as if to say, 'That's stupid. Melanie is not the cause of this, literally or figuratively.' WHAT DOESN'T WORK (supposedly): <ul><li>For the better part of an hour the story plays out as a slow drama, which will likely turn off those with ADHD. Personally, I find this approach refreshing in light of the frenetic editing and absurd action sequences of modern 'blockbusters.' Films like 'The Birds' seem almost daring by comparison; in fact, it's startling. Besides, the beautiful Bodega Bay photography provides some nice backdrop eye-candy to help maintain one's attention with the soap operatics.</li></ul><ul><li>One obvious plot hole is: Why do Melanie, the schoolmarm and the kids flee the schoolhouse? Wouldn't it be wiser to simply blockade themselves in an inner room with no windows? Or maybe there isn't such an interior room big enough to fit all the kids; after all, it appears to be a fairly small schoolhouse.</li></ul><ul><li>Complaints about Melanie's supposedly lame prank on Mitch (Taylor) are nitpicking at best; and criticisms of Melanie foolishly searching for the source of a mysterious sound -- even though she must know what it is -- can easily be chalked up to curiosity killing the cat (for instance, while stopping by Point Pleasant, WV, on vacation in 2005 I went into an old abandoned building that used to be a home for troubled kids back in the day; my wife refused to go any where near the creepy domicile but I HAD to go in and look around; even the satanic graffiti and shocked birds flying out the windows didn't deter me!).</li></ul><ul><li>After recently seeing films like the remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose', I can hardly find 'The Birds' horrifying, although I certainly find it very entertaining. Really, the creepiest aspect of the movie is Mitch's hovering, suspicious mother, played by Jessica Tandy -- whoa, is she scary.</li></ul><ul><li>The age difference of Mitch and his sister seems off. Taylor (Mitch) was 33 years-old during filming, although he looks to be more like 40 or older, but his sister in the story (Veronica Cartwright) was only 13. That's a twenty-year difference. I could see her being his daughter, but his sister? Also, if Veronica is 13 that means his creepy mother had sex a mere 13 years before -- and that's a really scary thought! </li></ul>WHAT WORKS: <ul><li>As noted above, the slow dialogue-driven drama of the first hour is actually appealing in light of the modern glut of moronic cgi-laden, frenetically-edited drivel, not to mention the awesome coastal Northern California cinematography.</li></ul><ul><li>Viewing the film is like going back in time to the early 60s. It's entertaining to see the clothing and decor styles, as well as social interactions, etc.</li></ul><ul><li>Although I don't find Tippi sexy, I do enjoy her facial expressions. I know this is an odd comment, but she does have that Paul Stanley pouty lips rockstar expression down pat.</li></ul><ul><li>Suzanne Pleshette's in the cast -- now SHE's sexy.</li></ul><ul><li>There are numerous memorable and thrilling sequences -- the various bird attacks, the guy with no eye balls, the phone booth scene, etc. I also enjoyed the interesting discussion on birds in the diner sequence.</li></ul><ul><li>!!END SPOILER!! I love the mysterious way the film ends with no explanation or dialogue. The sea of birds seem to permit their departure, even though the fowls could easily stop them if they wanted. </li></ul>The film runs 2 hours. GRADE: A-",9,4,8,31 January 2011
Jurassic Park," Family-friendly adventure mixed with total horror
","I saw 'Jurassic Park' at the theater with my then-girlfriend wife in 1993. There was much anticipation concerning Spielberg's dinosaurs and, as far as that goes, the film delivers. The story is a good-enough stage for the dinosaurs and the characters are okay. As my title blurb points out, this is essentially a Disney adventure with horrific dinosaurs.The latter is where the film excels, but it takes a whole hour to arrive. The good thing about the long wait is that it creates much anticipation. ('Jurassic Park III' does the exact opposite and suffers for it). When the t-rex sequence arrives it is both most welcome and truly horrifying. Two other thrilling scenes are memorable – the t-rex chasing the jeep and the closing velociraptor sequence, particularly in the kitchen.As far as the principle cast goes, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum are effective as the male protagonists while Laura Dern is likable enough. She doesn't trip my trigger in the sex appeal department, but that's just a matter of taste. The kids are good, especially the girl (Ariana Richards), while Richard Attenborough comes across as Santa Claus. Wayne Knight plays the quasi-villain and he originally struck me as wandering off the set of another movie. Seeing the film recently, he's still a bit over-the-top and cartoony, but provides a necessary contrast to the other characters.The film runs 127 minutes and was shot in Hawaii, Dominican Republic and Costa Rica.BOTTOM LINE: The dinosaurs and thrills are A+ while the story and characters are just good-enough. This is a straight-ahead family-friendly adventure with little depth and there's nothing wrong with that, especially since the film delivers what we came for – realistic-looking dinosaurs, and more – total horror.GRADE: B",7,0,1,16 December 2012

Valkyrie," Not all Germans supported that madman
","RELEASED IN 2008 and directed by Bryan Singer, 'Valkyrie' is a World War II crime thriller based on the true story of the last German plot to assassinate Hitler in the Summer of 1944, although it wasn't a crime, of course, but rather an act of heroism.Tom Cruise resembles the protagonist, Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, but he lacks his height. Despite this, Cruise is solid in the role and the story works up some quality suspense. Even though we know the plot will fail, you can't help but root for the dissenters' success. Almost 5000 Germans were subsequently executed on grounds of treason for the failed attempt, although not all of them were connected to this specific conspiracy.The film is both entertaining and educational. It shows that there were thousands of Germans who were willing to risk all to get that lunatic out of office. And they almost succeeded. 'Valkyrie' is reminiscent of 1976's 'The Eagle has Landed' in some ways so, if you liked that one, you'll probably appreciate 'Valkyrie.'

Yes, it's about developing your head, heart, and courage to find your way 'home,' but its most potent moral is about pulling back the curtain on politics, authorities and religion to expose the feeble phony pulling the levers.Which isn't to say that all such authorities are feeble phonies, of course, just that we need to be ever conscious of the fakes trying to manipulate us by pulling our strings.What a work of brilliance!The film runs 102 minutes.GRADE: A+",10,3,5,13 September 2014
Rock Star," The late 80s/early 90s metal scene
","2001's 'Rock Star' is loosely based on the metal band Judas Priest, who hired the lead singer of an Ohio JP tribute band, Tim 'Ripper' Owens, after losing their original singer, Rob Halford, aka 'the metal god' (taken from the Priest song 'Metal Gods'), which explains why the movie was originally to be called 'The Metal God'. All the major plot points of this film parallel the Judas Priest story; only the names and times have been altered.In 'Rock Star' the band is Steel Dragon (fictional of course), the singer of the tribute band is Chris 'Izzy' Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and the man he's replacing is Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng). Jennifer Aniston plays Izzy's girlfriend Emily and the Steel Dragon band members include Dominic West (who's excellent as always), Jason Bonham, Jeff Pilson and Zakk Wylde. Timothy Spall and Dagmara Dominczyk also have prominent roles as Steel Dragon's road manager and public relations manager respectively.The Ripper Owens story is an excellent tale for a film and this is a good movie, but the times are a bit off. In reality Rob Halford left Judas Priest in late 1991, corresponding to the advent of grunge, and Ripper Owens replaced him in early 1996; in the film the original singer leaves circa 1989 and the tribute band singer replaces him almost immediately. Ripper Owens didn't leave Judas Priest until 2003 whereas Izzy obviously leaves somewhere around late 1991/early 1992.'Rock Star' is just an enjoyable experience, especially if you're personally familiar with the 80s/early 90s' metal scene. The soundtrack includes numerous great songs from that era, as well as the 70s (like Ted Nugent's 'Stranglehold'). Unfortunately there's not one cut by Judas Priest (!). Apparently Judas Priest were originally linked to the project but ultimately disassociated themselves due to failing to reach a financial agreement for the rights to the story; this is when the producers decided to 're-imagine' the tale, as they say. This is all well and good but shouldn't there be as least one Priest song in the soundtrack? Where's the justice? The film takes the middle road between advocating the rock star lifestyle and decrying it. It shows both the glories and the pitfalls. When something's no longer fun and genuine it's simply time to move on -- to thine own self be true. Such experiences naturally have both positive and negative elements. Even if the experience ends up being more bad than good it's a necessary stepping stone to who you ultimately become, that is, who you are, your true success. A good example is Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. (check out their 2009 album BABYLON to get my drift).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film). Some criticize the movie on the grounds that Chris (Izzy) turns to playing grunge in Seattle after leaving Steel Dragon, maintaining that he was a 'poser' all along. But didn't Rob Halford himself explore different styles of music when he left Judas Priest, in particular the band Two? In the film Chris accomplishes his dream and by the end has had his fill of the whole 'rock star' phenomenon with all its ridiculous trappings; he was older & wiser now and understandably wanted to write his OWN songs (as he wasn't allowed in Steel Dragon, neither was Ripper in real life) and opts to explore his art. Keep in mind that Ripper himself was a grunge fan and fronted a grunge tribute band called Seattle in the early 90s. When Chris leaves Steel Dragon grunge is the flavor of the month and he just goes with it; he's still young and he's exploring, that's it. I'm sure he'll go on to revisit his metal roots in the future just as Rob Halford ultimately did after his 90s' meanderings; the film just doesn't take us that far ahead. ***END SPOILER*** FINAL WORD: 'Rock Star' may not be great but it's certainly an enjoyable film on the late 80s/early 90s music scene. It's equal parts dramatic, fun, funny, realistic, inspiring, educational and sobering.GRADE: B (6.5/10) INCIDENTAL NOTE: I was the guitarist/songwriter for a metal band in the early 90s and we opened up for Tim Owens' JP tribute band in Youngstown, OH in the winter of 1995.

Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA while Jessica Chastain plays the leader of the vessel. Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor and several other notables are on hand.The only way for Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' (2015) to work is if it can convince you that Damon's character is actually on Mars, which it does spectacularly and realistically (minus a few forced dramatics or stabs at humor here and there). If, like me, you're fascinated by Mars or the potential of living on another planet in the real world, 'The Martian' is a must.It's reminiscent of movies like 'Armegeddon' (1998), 'Mission to Mars' (2000), 'Gravity' (2013) and '2001: A Space Odyssey' (1968), albeit without the fantastical elements of some of these. It even brings to mind the first acts of 'Planet of the Apes' (1968) and 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes' (1970).The movie scores pretty well on the female front with Chastain, Mackenzie Davis, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig.

Evil Dead II," Awkward, confusing start turns into insane, over-the-top horror comedy
","RELEASED IN 1987 and written & directed by Sam Raimi, 'The Evil Dead' chronicles events when two Michigan State students (Bruce Campbell & Denise Bixler) travel to a remote cabin in western Tennessee for spring break wherein they discover a copy of the Book of the Dead and an audiotape whose incantations resurrect demons in the woods. The daughter of the archeologist who made the tape (Sarah Berry) also visits the cabin with her beau (Richard Domeier) and a couple of dubious locals (Dan Hicks & Kassie Wesley DePaiva). The first film was low-budget, cartoony and extreme, but it was serious horror. This sequel is also cartoony and extreme, but it's decidedly comedy horror. It's entertaining for what it is, but it's hindered by a confusing opening 'recap' that doesn't match the previous film. Raimi stated that he didn't have the rights to use material from the original movie so he did a 7-minute recap with only two people instead of five (with Denise Bixler taking over the role of Linda). But there are other inconsistencies: The Book of the Dead and audiotape is found in a room rather than the basement and Ash (Campbell) later 'rediscovers' that the bridge is out, which he already knew via events in the first film. Once you get past the awkward and perplexing set-up, the movie settles into an entertaining over-the-top gory horror comedy, which is so creative it's as if it was made by a lunatic. Bixler is a great replacement in the role of Linda, but her part is too brief and you only catch glimpses of her stunning beauty. It took me a while to warm up to Annie (Berry), but I eventually did and she's a worthy secondary protagonist. There are several amusing and thrilling sequences, like the demonic hand scenes. THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 24 minutes and was shot in Wadesboro and (studio) Wilmington, North Carolina, with supplementary work done in Detroit. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Scott Spiegel.

High Fidelity," Romantic head games become tedious
","Released in 2000 and directed by Stephen Frears, 'High Fidelity' is a romcom/dramedy starring John Cusack, as Rob, the owner of a Chicago record store, co-starring Jack Black and Todd Louiso as his two employees, Barry and Dick. When Rob's relationship with his live-in girlfriend, Laura (Iben Hjejle) falls apart, he reflects on the five worst break-ups of his dozen years of dating. His past girlfriends are played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joelle Carter, Lili Taylor and Natasha Gregson Wagner. Tim Robbins appears as Rob's rival for Laura's affections while Joan Cusack is on hand as Laura's sister. Lisa Bonet plays a rocker chick, a passing fancy for Rob. Sara Gilbert has a bit part.What's interesting about 'High Fidelity' is that it features the five general prototypes of guys' dating life: (1.) the first crush & kiss, (2.) adolescent urgency & loss of virginity, (3.) the hot babe out of his league, (4.) the rebound best friend & soul mate, and (5.) his one true love (maybe).If you've ever made a compilation tape for a babe and worked at a record store you might appreciate this film. You'll particularly like it if you favor romantic head games, which I find irritating and is the main reason I have mixed feelings about the film (speaking as a one-woman type of guy). Because of this, I had a hard time staying with it, although there's enough good in the movie to make it somewhat worthwhile. It's witty and you can tell the creators put a lot of thought into it, but Rob's mopey reflections as he constantly speaks to the camera get tedious after a while. Don't get me wrong, John pulls off the challenging lead role and does so convincingly; I just found his perpetually-smoking character uninteresting. As far as the soundtrack goes, the 90's pop rock struck me as mostly bland.Thankfully, there are several amusing moments. For instance, the scene where someone confronts Rob at the record store in the second half is laugh-out-loud funny, but Rob's relationship with Laura is decidedly Uninteresting; and Laura's emotional instability and indecisiveness become increasingly annoying (anyone who would marry such a relationally fickle person would have to be insane). Actually, most of Rob's romantic relationships become annoying although, like I said, there are amusing bits. Then there's Barry who arrogantly thinks his opinion on music is law; I kept hoping he'd get his teeth knocked in. On a positive note, the mental manipulations of Rob's unstable romantic life are offset by Dick, who shows the way to go.'Empire Records' (1995) is the better movie simply because it doesn't go overboard with the dating/romance head games crap.The film runs 113 minutes and was shot in Chicago.GRADE: C",5,0,3,26 November 2016
The Island," Worthwhile sci-fi/action film with McGregor and Johansson
","Released in 2005, Michael Bay's 'The Island' is a sci-fi/action flick starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as survivors in a post-apocalyptic society in 2019. Survivors of some sort of great 'contamination' regularly pour into the huge facility where the people are strictly monitored by the staff and winners of a lottery are promised to go to a paradisal island. McGregor's character starts to suspect that all is not as it appears and tries to escape with his girlfriend (Johansson).Bay has a bad reputation for making snazzy blockbuster dreck, like the 'Transformers' series. While I'm not a fan of those movies—simply because they don't interest me -- I AM a fan of 2001's 'Pearl Harbor,' which is ridiculously and undeservedly panned, and – less so – 1998's 'Armageddon.' So what about 'The Island'? It showcases state-of-the-art filmmaking with similarities to the great 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' albeit not as good. The first act is very intriguing as the viewer tries to figure out the nature of the enclosed society and the second act kicks into overdrive with some outstanding action sequences. Unfortunately, the third act isn't able to keep up the dynamic momentum despite a string of intense action sequences. Still, this is definitely a worthwhile sci-fi/action movie.The film runs 136 minutes and was shot in Nevada, California and Detroit.GRADE: B",7,1,1,22 March 2015
The Godfather," Coppola's masterpiece about Italian gangsters in the 1940s with Brando, Pacino, Caan & Duvall
","RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, 'The Godfather' stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the 'hysterical' sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, 'The Godfather' is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's 'Bullitt'); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent 'love at first sight' moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California. WRITERS: Coppola & Mario Puzo from Puzo's book.GRADE: A",9,0,0,20 September 2017
