Skyfall," An obsoleted Plot/Drama but very Close to Realistic Spy's(Bond) Life
","Skyfall movie has an Obsoleted plot/drama, which is definitely not worth for a hi-Spy(I think James bond should be the Top Spy guys round the globe,fictionally at-least) film. Though the excitement begins right with the beginning scene, it won't last longer. But I like the movie because it has everything shown 'Real', everybody, esp, the Villains' character.To briefly explain the plot in 5 steps:1 Bond dies in a Chase but returns/resurrects 2 M officially orders 007 to identify the Villain, meanwhile she faces Political stress. 3 Bond traces & arrests the Villain(a former M16agent), but he escapes 4 Bond takes M to His childhood place, Scotland-Skyfall building to Rescue from Villain 5 Villain traces, destroys everything, Bond kills him but M dies from her earlier wound.The movie has few breathe holding action(natural) episodes we would normally expect from Daniel craigs' bond movies. But it might make you think/feel: 'if the Movie makers had tried to show the movie in a Real-World(realistic) way, they could have created something better than this'. I like the Movie however...;-)",7,1,6,10 November 2012
