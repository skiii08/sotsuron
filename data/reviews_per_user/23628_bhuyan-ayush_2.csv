Black Swan," freakishness + awesomeness!
","I saw Darren Aronofsky's 'Requiem for a Dream' last year and fell in love with the director (no! i am straight). I have always had hopes from this guy. But this movie that I saw today didn't just live up to my expectations, in fact it exceeded way above it! I have a whole new level of respect and appreciation for this amazing director. The movie 'Black Swan' is another masterpiece added to Darren's collection of dark psycho thrillers. The movie is about a ballet dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) who has been selected for the upcoming ballet performance 'Black Swan'. Actually she replaces the former dancer Beth(Winona Ryder) because of her age. Overwhelmed and delighted Nina starts practicing for the day. The rest is a journey through her life as she faces the various hurdles for getting chosen for the Swan ( the main character of the ballet)and her relationship with people around her including the ballet director Thomas Leroy(Vincent Cassel). There's another dancer Lily (Mila Kunis) who is competing with her for the role.The only thing that I want to add without spoiling the suspense is that Nina is a die hard perfectionist and crosses all boundaries to perfect her character.Okay, thats all i can reveal right now. But TRUST me there's a mighty lot more to the story. I have so much to talk about this movie. Darren has continued with his style of direction with graphic and vivid repetitive sequences. I felt so much of the dark and depressive ambiance generated in the movie. And like always even Black Swan doesn't fail to leave a painful clog in the throat by the end of it. Lets take up each aspect one by one. First the acting. I HAVE to say, after the direction the next brightest jewel in the crown is Natalie Portman herself. She undoubtedly is one of the most gorgeous women in Hollywood and my all time favorite (since Star Wars itself). But not just an eye pleaser she is, an equally terrific acting in the movie displays the immense talent she has within her. The sequences with Nina's mother, the ballet director, Lily, Beth every little and noticeable piece of acting by her is just flawless. In fact it seems Natalie, just like her character Nina has some perfection in her. The grace and elegance that she carries in the movie is incredible. so thats a thumbs up for Natalie. Next is the overall ambiance and mood. DUDE, how in the name of god do you do it? This movie is a total psycho freak show with scary,brain squeezing sequences,depressing scenes and beautiful dancing. There are seemingly random and haphazard scenes, but even within this chaos lies a serene order in the storyline that makes complete sense. This piece of art demands a huge amount of maturity and understanding for you to be able to appreciate it. In fact this is the only possible con i can think of. Some of you might find it notoriously tough to get it in the head (and for the others to get it out). So I highly recommend the movie for the people of the second kind. Saddening but very enjoyable movie 'Black Swan' has made it to my list of best 10 movies seen. Not better than Requiem but a fairly close rival. The movie also has a message in it ( which depends upon the viewer to decipher). Okay i guess thats pretty much it. Go watch it you wont regret !!",9,2,3,30 July 2011
Changeling," a must watch!
","I must say this movie is the best i've seen over the past few days. It has all the elements that a drama should have, beautiful moments, powerful acting, amazing dialogs and an ending with some food for thought for the viewer. Okay so basically this movie revolves around a single mother from LA (year 1928), Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie) and her struggles with the LAPD to search for her son who goes missing one day. She finds herself in a difficult spot when the police turn in a boy few days later which as Christine claims is not her son. Now this is where the real deal begins. Realizing the corrupt intentions of LAPD officials who try to save their image by not accepting the mistake, Christine makes a media statement on this matter. The rest of the movie focuses on the efforts of the police to prevent her from making a courtroom appearance and the mother's endeavor to find her son. The movie has its share of emotional, sentimental scenes (especially the ones in a psychopath treatment center). The story on the whole is engrossing and satisfying and confronts some heavy issues pertaining to the malfunctioning and corrupt LAPD during those times. Angelina Jolie has done a fairly well job. There's one thing though, I felt the movie getting stagnant after 2 hours and it seemed a bit boring after that. But thats just a very negligible flaw and the awesome plot more than compensates for it. Oh ya by the way this is based on a true story. Overall, this movie is a must watch and I highly recommend watching it. What happens to the boy? Does Christine get him back?...of course you'll have to watch it to find out!",Null,0,1,30 July 2011
