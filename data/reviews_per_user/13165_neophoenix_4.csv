Alien 3," Try to distinguish films from legends
","True, sequels are a regular source of disappointments. I feel this sequel, and it's successor, can't compare to the first two, especially the second. But I tried to look at this movie as just this: a movie, and not a sequel. Many movies would pale in comparison to Cameron's masterpiece. Alien³ is the continuing saga of Ripley's battle against the malevolent Aliens. The movie's tone and mood are very dark, and I think that it's an excellent style for this section of the story line. The character Ripley loses everything dear to her, and her character is duly morose in this movie. Instead of trying to go against the Company, she is now fighting out of pure revenge. While many people were disappointed with the ending, I think it perfectly fits the main theme. While not the 'Aliens' blockbuster, I do think this movie does the saga justice. If you want a happy ending to the story, don't watch Alien³ and Alien Resurrection. If you want a much darker and melancholy ending, finish out the story to it's conclusion.",Null,0,2,29 July 2001
Amélie," I love Jean-Pierre Jeunet
","I saw both 'La Cité des Enfants Perdus' ('City of Lost Children') and 'Alien: Resurrection' (both masterminded by Jeunet) and loved the off-beat and chronically quirky aura surrounding the two movies. From set design to plot to the characters themselves, things were just 'off', but in the most captivating and dazzling way. When I heard of this movie, I knew from the very beginning that I was in for a real treat; that no way would I be disappointed. There was no doubt that I would love this movie. And I did. Granted 'Amélie' was much more upbeat than either of the aforementioned (darker) movies, but Jeunet's lovable eccentricity is woven into the film nonetheless. I am waiting (im)patiently for his next gem of a movie. If you want a wonderfully uplifing movie that will move you and make you laugh, rent this film. Hell, rent it no matter what. I guarantee you'll love 'Amélie'.",10,0,2,22 November 2002
The Matrix," A veneer of mystery
","This has to be one of the most original movies ever made. The completely believable plot combined with superhuman abilities makes for a dazzling display of martial arts and high-tech wizardry. And I cannot stress how ingenious this movie is to first display all these things that look effortlessly slick, and then make you believe it's possible for you to do them too. This movie focuses on the premise that we aren't in the reality we think we are; that there is something evil and malevolent lurking beyond our senses. And, I say again, it is completely believable and rational in its approach. If you want a movie that will thoroughly entertain you and at the same time, easily disconnect your from reality, WATCH THIS FILM.",Null,0,0,9 August 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Coen Brothers: Cinematic Crackerjacks
","The only other Coen Brothers film I've seen is 'Fargo', and I fully enjoyed that movie. When I saw commercials for 'O Brother', I had NO CLUE what the movie was supposed to be about. But seeing that it was a Coen Brothers film, I decided it was worth a watch. I was extremely pleased, watching this film on an airplane, then on home video. This movie is an extremely fun fare; not serious in the slightest. If you want a realistic fun-filled journey, watch this film.",Null,1,1,12 July 2001
