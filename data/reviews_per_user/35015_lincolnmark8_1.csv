Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Vol.2 Blows Vol. 1 Away
","Like a lot of people, I liked the first one for the action and the quirky one liners.  I felt that the story was average and the plot lacked a punch. I still gave it 4 out of 4 stars.  Vol. 2...is better.  Granted, there is not as much action (which, to me, is a good thing) but there is more Tarantino dialogue.  I loved ever part of this movie, and i was never bored. The piecing of 'The Brides' past and present was the key to this film. The plot unfolds and the story is told. Unlike vol. 1, we actually feel for the bride and for bill.  We understand the story, and we understand the characters.  Tarantino has built some powerful players in this film.  This movie is better than vol. 1 in virtually every way, and will surely make my top 100 upon second viewing.  My only gripe is that the ending wasn't quite as fantastic...but I guess that could be a good thing.  As in, it wasn't expected.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
