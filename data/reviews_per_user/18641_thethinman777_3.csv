Alien 3," Massively underrated. Silly, silly people.
","Make no mistake; Alien 3 has flaws, all of which are right up on the screen for you to see and hear. Noted for having a script which was being written alongside principle photography - it shows: Dialogue swings from great to terrible in a heartbeat, identikit prisoners suddenly start to develop a glimmer of character.....then vanish without a trace. Vincent Ward's original idea sounded brilliant but gutless suits saw fit to butcher it and force out a rushed lovechild of the first two films (one alien/bigger group of humans). The best example of the problematic script comes when Dillon asks Ripley how she got impregnated by the alien and she replies with; 'I don't know, in hypersleep I guess.' For a franchise that had already built an established mythology that simply wasn't good enough. I saw it when I was fifteen (just managed to pass for eighteen) and even then I could tell it had problems.......but I absolutely loved it.All these negative reviews are understandable but have any of you seen the restored version? Probably not. If you still haven't seen this film then ONLY watch that version as the original cut has the biggest plot hole of all time. I feel that with this newer version Alien 3 can be enjoyed for what it is: Dark, viciously nihilistic, visually stunning, atmospheric and a great standalone sci-fi film. No, it doesn't sit very well with Alien and Aliens, and Fincher was obviously up against it the whole time, but a poor film? No. Too much hard work and style is present and correct for that to be true. You people do disappoint me so.",9,17,17,5 June 2012
Love Actually," If you haven't seen this film yet, don't. I've watched it for you.
","This is the worst film I've ever seen. No, actually that isn't fair. I've seen Troll 2 and The Room but they are so bad that they don't really count as films. This monster has a budget, and movie stars, and music and other things to distract you from looking it right in the eyes and seeing the horror. I'm partly to blame; I paid to see this at the cinema all those years ago. It shot itself in the head in the first minute or so with an ill-advised voice-over, then flat-lined a few minutes later with a scene in a church that, for the life of me, I cannot delete from my memory, in spite of all the damage it may be doing to my subconscious. I spent the rest of that viewing looking around at other people, wondering why they were laughing, wondering if I was dreaming. Some weren't laughing, a few walked out, which gave me some hope in humanity. I didn't leave, I stuck it out and took it like a man. Mistake. You want to see scars? Look at my face when someone asks me what I think about this film. If you haven't seen this film yet or you have and you're going to watch it again, do it if you must. If you do though, don't be distracted. Listen carefully and look, look the monster right in the eyes and see it: The horror.",Null,2,6,4 October 2011
Prometheus," A mess and a half.
","Let's forget for a moment that this film came with all the baggage of being an Alien prequel of sorts, along with the knowledge that it isn't really one either but a standalone attempt at something original. Forget for just a moment that this was directed by Ridley Scott. After watching Prometheus I had no choice but to forget these things because I had to judge it for what it was it really was; a remake of Mission To Mars.......and that film sucked. I was gob-smacked when I realised, halfway through this mess, that its strongest influence was that torturous celluloid skid-mark. It even has a horribly misjudged score.The positives: The visuals are, for the most part, great. Good job by anyone in that department. Ummm......err.....nope, that's it.The negatives: It's not entertaining, a major crime for a film to commit. The script is absolutely awful and can be held responsible for nearly all of this films shortcomings. Decent pacing almost entirely absent, inept, clich√©-ridden (and awesomely stupid) dialogue that makes you cringe......it's just bad. Editing is all over the place, which is either a reflection of the script or just bad editing, I may never know for sure. Want to care about characters? Tough luck. Empathy has to be earned. The really good films do this in a variety of ways but this isn't one of those films. Like to be frustrated? Good, you're in for a treat (the editing will be your best friend). Anger may well follow so take some precautions. Big ideas? Oh please, it's just the same old, tired questions that have been around for ever: Why are we here? Where do we come from? Who made us? Is there a God? Blah, blah, blah. I find it more interesting that we don't know the answers to those questions anyway but Prometheus asks them......and then forgets that it did and vanishes up it's crack into the void (where it finds kinship with The Fountain and they live happily ever after). After watching Reason and her close friend Logic being raped for two hours the ending broke my heart and all I could see was Tim Robbins floating in space with a frozen head.I love Alien 3. The majority doesn't but, with the longer cut available, I think that David Fincher crafted a unique, memorable and stylish space-horror out of a complete mess and horrible working conditions. That takes considerable talent. Ridley Scott and company had time, space, freedom and access to all the latest toys.....and we get this.It's a crime. Someone needs to go to jail (at the very least for those horribly misleading trailers).Wait a minute! It's me isn't it *facepalm*. I'm just unable to appreciate what I saw.....too stupid I guess. I mean, it's not like the trailers were desperate or anything so it's my fault for having any kind of expectation at all. Boy, do I feel stupid. I must not have an open mind, that's it. My mistake.",3,33,69,7 June 2012
