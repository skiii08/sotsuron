Deja Vu," Voulez vous 'Deja Vu' -- Most Certainly
","For every person who ever dreamed they could simply venture back in time to change something, then 'Deja Vu' just may be the movie for them. 'Deja Vu' stars Denzel Washington as an ATF agent who falls for a murder victim who he travels back in time to try to save. The movie's initial twist comes when Denzel's character, Doug Carlin, learns that the victim attempted to contact him before her death. The movie's intensity grows when Carlin is recruited by a newly-formed FBI investigative unit headed by a character played by Val Kilmer.'Deja Vu' examines voyeurism, both real and imagined, partly by raising the question as to whether 'Big Brother' is truly watching. This film additionally explores the true definition of courage in modern day society where the threat of terrorism is ever present and is now a globally recognized issue.'Deja Vu' has all the makings of a good film -- good plot, good acting, good cinematography, and good directing -- and delivers. Washington's acting is solid and is rounded out by an equally talented cast of supporting actors, including newcomer Paula Patton, Val Kilmer, Jim Caviezel, and Adam Goldberg. Tony Scott continues his genius of wide-spanning, action-packed cinematography and keeps the momentum flowing throughout the film. 'Deja Vu' parses down the basic human desire to be able to go back in time to save our loved ones while also showing the potential consequences of directly interfering with 'destiny.' (Thereby posing the question are certain things destined no matter what our efforts.) In patronage to the movie's New Orleans setting, 'Voulez vous 'Deja Vu'?' Most certainly with this winning cast.",8,1,2,3 December 2007
