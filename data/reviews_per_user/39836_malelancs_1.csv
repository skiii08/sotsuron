Sucker Punch," Shame some can't see the wood for the trees!
","Yes, a 'love/hate movie'...I can't help but think the nay sayers are shallow sad sacks.Are they forgetting the movie begins with 'babydoll' (A vulnerable young woman) and her sister losing what appears to be their mother...A wicked male relative seems as though he wants to abuse her (perhaps again) and then he turns to the younger sister.Babydoll accidentally shoots her sister whilst trying to defend them.The evil man once again abuses his power and bribes a member of staff at an 'asylum' to cover his back for his wrong doings...The nay sayers seem to focus on the 'scantily clad actions scenes', which imo seems to reflect more about their character and lack of vision and as Jimi asked;'Are you experienced?'... It is perhaps also a reflection of how our 'western' culture relies so much on the visual, advertising demands it right!So many threads, opportunities for reflection, metaphor... for me, possibly the matrix of the decade...btw, for the kids who believe it is demeaning to women... get with the program, adults can watch porn if they want that... this film offers much more... get over yourself!",10,1,3,24 December 2011
