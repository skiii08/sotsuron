Source Code," Repetitive plot that you can guess in the first five minutes
","I'll try and keep this spoiler free so people who are thinking of watching this can get a good idea about it.But, this review is simple. It's been done before! If anyone has watched star trek or most any other television sci-fi, you will guess this plot in the first 5 minutes as I did. You probably won't be able to predict the ending as there is a decent twist. However, the ending twist I'd say kind of ruins the 'moving' aspect of the movie as well and just makes it even more kind of bland. But, now that I say that if the movie had ended in another way I probably would have thought it just even more typical and over done.It's enjoyable, but only if you have something better to see or haven't watched a lot of sci fi before and don't get the plot in the first 5 minutes.",6,1,2,6 December 2011
