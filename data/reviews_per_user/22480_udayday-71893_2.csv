First Man," Booooooooooooooring to the extent that u feel sick
","DON'T watch this boring , pointless, shallow and sleepy movie. It doesn't deserve more words or reviewing ... this movie is time wasting",2,0,2,28 November 2018
Spectre," Without doubt this is the worst Bond movie ever
",Is this real or a nightmare?? it is worse than a nightmare for any Bond's fan ...why the producers made such pathetic movie? ..do they need more money or what exactly.?? When we watched Casino Royal we said Oh..thanks to God ...Bond returns strongly ..what an amazing Bond's movie...then Quantum of Solace was good enough ....then SKYFALL was great as well.....and now we got SPECTRE a disaster end for Daniel Craig....i wish to have the ability to describe the scenes specially the actions like the critics do ...just to tell the Bond's makers ... respect the audiences we are in 2015.cuz you are underestimating our smartness.,1,1,6,21 January 2016
