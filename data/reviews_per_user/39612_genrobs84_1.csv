Captain Phillips," Tension Roller-Coaster
","There have been few movies I've gone to where at the end I feel the same as the character(s). 'Captain Phillips' is now one of them. The entire film is what I'd call a tension roller-coaster. In the beginning the tension is almost non-existent. But, because we know the story how it happened in real life, we're already 'suspenced' by anticipation. As the film progresses we see how Phillips, his crew, and the US Navy, went to great lengths to keep the pirates at bay by cunningly surreptitious means. The tension rises and falls as the pirates become increasingly paranoid of their counterparts until it crescendos so loud it's as if you're suffering alongside Phillips right there.When it stops, the shock is almost too real. Tom Hanks' performance of Phillips and the end of the crisis shows exactly what can happen to a person when they walk out of a life and death situation alive. The disbelief is so overwhelming, your mind goes numb. He did it so well, I thought for a minute he really was in shock.The story is not just about Phillips and how he handled the ordeal. The film periodically focuses on all the captains involved in this event: Phillips, Muse (Somali captain), the US Destroyer captain, and the SEAL commander. It reminds those who are not captains of men to ask what would you do in such circumstances if it were you? If you were a leader of men burdened with a dangerous task, how would you handle it?Finally, I'd suggest readers not fall for the hype others have posted about this film. You know who you are. It is not about ''Merica' and how we kicked a$$. It's about real men and the danger they faced. Of course, there are some artistic licenses, but that's a given with Hollywood. It's still an astounding story, with incredible acting, and nail-biting excitement.",9,0,1,4 December 2013
