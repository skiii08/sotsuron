Alien 3," Alien 3 :the mother of all alien movies!
","Oh what a joy this movie is! What a winning eerie atmosphere from start to finish!!!
The plot of the movie is logical contrary to what people are saying. Ridley lands on a prison planet and finds newt dead and needs an autopsy, enter the brilliant Charles dance as the doctor/ brief lover to ripley. Actually my only gripe is that dance gets killed off far too quick! Anyway ripley soon realizes there is 2 aliens ; one inside her and one roaming around the planet killing off a few of the prisoners including the warden ( poetic justice for a nasty piece of work). Her plan is to kill both at the furnace where she had cremated newt earlier. It works and finally we have a T2 style ending of ripley lowering herself into the furnace just as her alien is shooting out! What an ending!!!! I was gripped from start to finish and had a great time in the flicks back in 1992. The finest alien movie of the whole lot",9,3,4,7 February 2019
Rocky V," Superb rocky picture
",This picks up from the fallout of what happened in rocky 4 and then has the genuine excuse of going back to its roots which explains why they rehired John g avildsen. Love the way rocky always treated tommy Gunn with the utmost respect and then at the end just kicks his ass and puts him in his place and reminds him who is the greatest,8,1,2,3 July 2019
Die Hard 2," Better than the original
",Firstly the original is overrated populated by too many stooopid characters among other problems with it. This movie starts proper after only a few minutes when mcclane spots 2 suspicious looking characters entering the luggage area and he kills one of them. This then sparks off the plot of the rest of the movie with unrelenting suspense thrills and action with a few laughs on the way as well. I love love love this movie with the best action scene with Bruce killing those fake painters with renny harlin putting that scene in slow motion for added effect. Anyway enjoy the movie if you haven't seen it before,10,1,2,17 February 2019
