Scarface," What a great movie.
",I love this movie. Some people say its too long but every time i sit through this 3 hour long movie i could sware that only an hour had past. I get into it so much. Al Pacino's performance is great and the dialogue is awesome. It is deffinetly one of the best movies of the 80's. Right up there with Raging Bull.,Null,0,1,20 November 2003
