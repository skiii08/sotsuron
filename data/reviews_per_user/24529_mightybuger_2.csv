United 93," What a great movie!
","I have seen many movies, and it's getting harder and harder for a movie to impress me. I have been disappointed by most of the movies I have seen this year, and was expecting the same response from United93. On the contrary, United93 was incredible; it told you the straight story with no fluff added. The way the movie was filmed made it even more realistic, like you are on the plain with the passengers. I knew the out come of the movie, but still the whole time I was hoping that maybe somehow the ending would be different,(I actually found myself hoping for a Hollywood ending).I left the theater with far greater respect for those who died on United93. This movie is deeply moving. I would recommend every American see it.",10,2,6,11 May 2006
Titanic," One of the Best!
","Titanic WAS known as the ship of dreams, but NOW is known as the movie of dreams. It is every director's dream to make a movie such as Titanic. It has become a grading scale for movies of today. At first I had no interest in seeing Titanic, but after all my friends saw it and wouldn't shut up about it I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Boy was I blown away. I have never seen a movie like it before. This is one of the few movies I have actually bought. I was completely satisfied in every way a movie goer should be satisfied. The Detail in the movie was unbelievable from the costumes, props, and set design. The music fit the movie perfectly, not one cue was out of place. All the acting was good especially from Kate Winslet and Gloria Stewart. If I had to state a negative about the movie the only thing I could possibly think of would TIME. This movie is LONG!!! But it is good, and I think it is well worth taking 3 hours out of your life to take a fascinating journey back to the heart of Titanic.",10,1,2,12 May 2006
