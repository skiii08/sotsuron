The Double Life of Véronique," Split Individuality
","'La double vie de Véronique' by Krzysztof Kiewlowski shows in a most remarkable way how a person can be split in two individuals  Weronica who lives in Poland and Véronique who lives in France. According to classical Aristotelian logic, however, an individual is bound by place, time and body. Nobody can show up in the same body in two different places and/or at two different times, but a look at several mythologies shows that this concept of individuality is nothing but our heritage from ancient Greek thinking. Logic and metaphysics that form the fundamental of our sciences but also of our daily perception are Aristotelian as well. According to Celtic logic, for example, a two- or tripartite individual causes no problems at all, since here the spatial and temporal axes do not go into the definition of the individual.In order to treat multi-partite individuality, it is thus necessary to abandon Aristotelian logic. Since Celtic mythology (as mythology in general) cannot be formalized like Aristotelian logic, one must understand that time- and space-bounding of individuality in classical thinking causes mono-contexturality, i.e. an abyss between two persons as big as the abyss between the Here and the Beyond. On the other side, a poly-contextural notion of individuality allows the exchange between individuals. Already in a three-valued poly-contextural logic, the question arises if Death means the loss of individuality as it does in a two-valued mono-contextural logic. It seems to be merely a decrease of matter, but not of mind. So, when Weronica dies in Poland, she is able to survive as Véronique in Paris. It is remarkable that this kind of 'doppelganger' shown in Kieslowski's movie does not belong to the frightening ones. In the opposite, since our perception of this world is not a two-valued 'light-switch' system but colorful, so also the logic on which our perception is based should not be a yes-no logic but allow more values outside of this mono-contextural dichotomy.While only very few people accept that two-valued logic is long outdated  although already Heisenberg's detection that subject and object cannot be differentiated anymore on the level of high energy physics proves that this logic is fragmentary -, it is amazing that poly-contextural moments show up so often in movies. Very seldom, however, this has been presented in such an intriguing manner as in 'La double vie de Véronique'. Since science fiction in literature has announced the various developments of computer technology such as robots or cyber space, it is possible that up to now still fictional elements of our thinking are now announced by film that precedes the future change in our perception and its logical and metaphysical bases to which belongs without doubt also the abandoning of the mistaken Greek concept of individuality.",10,2,5,1 June 2007
The Ring," A video that has not been made, but watched
","I would like to suggest a solution of what the ring in 'The Ring' is, around which two long movies circle. Many watchers may have asked themselves WHO after all has made the mysterious video-tape with this 'freaky stuff' in it (quotation). In 'The Ring' I, Noah wonders in the presence of Rachel that their copy isn't a copy (because of the scrambled code-numbers), moreover, in the scene where the lady is combing her hair one does not see the shadow of the camera, which one would expect. Not even the filmed persons' shadows can be seen in the pictured mirrors, etc. The worst thing, however, is, that the fly that appears in the tape is mirror-inverted when Rachel sees her the first time. When she sees her the second time, she comes even out of the picture. It is clear, that the latter event is meant to prepare what will happen in 'The Ring II' (2005), namely persons being able to transcend the con-texture-border between screen-inside and screen-outside reality. Actually, this phenomenon will be THE horror motive of the Ring II. But therefore, let us stick with the lacking shadows and the 'inverted' fly. Another most interesting question is that obviously, Samara's father was not the film-maker, since there will be more films after his suicide, especially during the whole 'Ring II'.I therefore suggest as a solution that the authors of 'The Ring' have used a seldom semiotic paradox, namely a sign without 'thetic' introduction. Normally, every sign has to be 'thetically' introduced, i.e. declared as a sign (the knot in your handkerchief, f.ex.). A sign is only a sign when there is somebody who declares it a sign. Sign do not exist in nature like eggs, boulders of water. Now, theoretically, one could think of a sign that consists only of a sign-carrier, an object, and, instead of the introducer of the sign, of at least one interpreter. Such a sign-model, at least in theory, fulfills the requirement of Peirce that a triadic sign relation is established. In other words: The mysterious video-tape in 'The Ring' is a film that has never been made - but only watched. Consequently, what is shown on the tape cannot concern the past (like in normal movies), but must concern the future. And this is exactly what is happening in 'The Ring': Rachel sees the lady, the mirror, the man standing on the upper level of the house, the burning tree, the worms ... and at the end the 'ring' itself.If this interpretation of mine is correct - and I have no doubts that it is allowed to impute such a high form of metaphysics to whoever wrote the script - , then this movie deserves not only 10 points but needs to be welcomed in the exclusive club of those seldom products of entertainment industry which have truly brought forward scientific thinking.",10,0,1,21 September 2009
Se7en," The story in the story and the lacking glue
","Although I agree with the majority of the critics that 'Se7en' (1995) is one of the outstanding horror movies of our time, I still have to warn to overrate it. It is definitely not a masterpiece like, e.g., Murnau's 'Nosferatu', where you will remember the first appearance of Max Schreck in the gate with a far remote camera until your last day.First, I do not understand why it was considered necessary to put a subsidiary story into the main story. 'Se7en' has a default dramaturgy, due to the 7 sins, as, e.g. 'The Lodger' (2007) has a default structure, due to the killings of Jack the Ripper, not to mention the 'Zodiac' killer movies, etc. Why was it necessary to put the character of Brad Pitt besides the character of Morgan Freeman? Both are in the rank of detectives - the older is a highlight, the younger a zero - the older stands above marriage, the younger is unable to be a good husband and future father and meanwhile enjoys his three of four dogs. But not enough with that: The writer of 'Se7en' considered it also important to build in a cross-relation, when Paltrow's character contacts Freeman without letting know Pitt. This one scene as well as their common gathering for a dinner are without any sense for the story, it is painful for Freeman's character - and for the real audience.Second, after having watched this movie a second time, it has lost all of its initial effects. This has nothing to do with the fact that the highlights of the killings as well as the killer are known now. Movies like 'Se7en' or 'Silence of the Lambs', in opposition to, e.g., 'The Ring', have simply not enough glue to stick so in your head so that you can watch enjoy 'Nosferatu', 'It's a wonderful life', 'My cousin Vinnie', 'As good as it gets', only to mention so few. What is it that makes a film stick in your head? What is this semiotic glue that makes the film go on in your head when you leave the cinema or take out the DVD from the player? If someone would find the mechanism, it would be easy to construct ideal movies that would guaranteed be block-buster hits.",10,0,0,4 October 2009
Hostel," The horror dropping out of slavering mouths
","'Hostel' (2005) consists of two parts. And just let me say it frankly: A first part that could not have been made in a more stupid way and almost caused me stopping the movie, and a second part which belongs to the best horror I have ever seen, and believe me, I am experienced. That the director had chosen Slowakia as a background for the second part shows anew that Eastern Europe is not just a cheap place for making a movie (with horrible wages for the indigenous stunts and no Eastern Europeans in the main roles), but delivers a scenery of Medieval castles, Kafkaesque towns and wide-spread farm-land as far the eye-sight reaches. The place where the movie was shot belong one thousand years long to Hungary until it had been taken away during the Trianon treaty in 1920. Since then, what has been called Slowakia for a few decades, has been and is degenerate, corrupt and brutal, and frankly, I would not be astonished if the horror that the movie depicts is been based on true events. On the other side, Slowakia or Upper-Hungary was also the place of the Hungarian countess Erzsebet Bathory who was one of the first known series killers. The Eastern European earth is imbued with history, every pebble tells you a story, so it is no wonder that Herzog shot his remake of Murnau's Nosferatu in the Slowakian Carpathians.What makes the horror in 'Hostel' so powerful is that it is not realistic like practically all horror movies that had been issued in the last decades, but naturalistic in the literary sense of the term. The camera stands behind the tormentors and turns so long until each angle of the gruesome scene is floodlighted and exhausted. The director, Eli Roth, does not make the mistake to try to give his naturalistic shots an aesthetic icing by heaving it off the actual scene. When you see the acts, you are really shocked, the movie achieves a hardly ever reached immediacy. Foreign businessmen travel to Slowakia simply and solely because in a decrepit factory amidst the trash that the communists left, there are kidnapped young foreign people imprisoned whom you are allowed to torture uninhibited by any moral bond if you just pay enough. You even see the pathologic lust dropping out of the slavering mouths, when the tormentors finally stand at the goal of their life-long dreams to get an orgasm from drilling out the eyes or burning through the Achilles tendons of innocent people.'Hostel' is without doubt one of the top-horror-movies of all times.",10,1,3,6 October 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Transputing Terminators
","Since the 1930ies, Science fiction, the 'genuine American fairytale' (Gotthard Günther), has anticipated a world determined by computers. The about six generations of computers built since Zuse share that they are unable to deal with circularity, i.e. self-reference, re-entry, autopoiesis, etc., because they are constructed according to classical logic which does not allow, e.g., a statement like 'I am lying', since this statement is true when I am lying and false when I am not lying, i.e. it is true when it is false and false when it is true. On similar reasons, comments about sentences are excluded, e.g. 'This sentence is true/false'. When we hear now, in 'Terminator 3' (2003), a sentence like 'My command is to protect you' or even stronger: 'Get away from me ... I have no choice ... I cannot control my functions ... I am a machine', then it is clear that in the case of terminators, we have to deal with a trans-classic logic and hence not with simple computers but with 'trans-puters', i.e. with computers that allow self-reference because the logical law of the Excluded Middle is abolished.From the above quotation it is also clear that when a machine says 'I have no choice ... I am a machine', it is self-aware on what it is, i.e. it has its own will. Its third logical value besides position and negation after the abolishment of the Law of the Excluded Middle allows this kind of machine to realize the difference between its program and its intent to react appropriately in a certain situation. Not even the newest computers can realize that, since they follow a logic in which the Law of the Excluded Middle is still valid. Here we also find the profoundest reason why terminators are that human-like (and, conversely, why they like to appear in human-like shape and sometimes lead to 'hermaphroditic' creatures like 'cyborgs', 'androids' and others): Control of will is hitherto still a feature by which humans are differentiated from machines. If we now watch terminators, we see that trans-puters presuppose formalization not only of cognition (like classical computers do), but also of volition. But formalization of volition would imply that from a certain point on the computer would transgress its constructor. There would not be anymore, as in classical computers, a symbiosis between constructor and construction.Such 'poly-contextural' computers (a term introduced by G. Günther during his work at the 'Biological Computer Laboratory' of the University of Illinois) with both formalized cognition and volition would fulfill Norbert Wiener's claim for Golem-like 'human-machines' uttered in his book 'The Human Use of Human Beings' (1950). However, from a general point of view it is strange that cybernetics, which was established as a science since the Macy conferences in New York (starting in 1946) and is nowadays practically extinct in the academic world, seems to survive in Science Fiction which, in its turn, is anticipating future computer generations. But since 'control' is a core-term of cybernetics, this science may perhaps become revitalized in times where whole continents are menaced by terrorism. If this is true, one should, however, not forget that total control must not only concern the reign of cognition but most utterly the empire of the will, too. Since this must not be done as in the case of Dr. Mabuse whose aim was simply to replace the will of humans by his own, but in allowing a machine to have its OWN will, the concept of formalization of volition only will imply both control and freedom.",7,1,2,24 December 2007
Being John Malkovich," What happens if you crawl into your own brain?
","I agree with the absolute majority of the hundreds of commentators who have honored this movie that its appearance has, in my words, a similar importance for the future movie-making as 'Citizen Kane' had at the beginning of the talkies. In short, there are movies before and after 'Citizen Kane', and now, there are movies before and after 'Being John Malkovich'. Since meanwhile 10 years have passed since BJM was broadcast, this prediction has proved to be right.I personally doubt that still in the 80ies it would have been possible to lance a box office hit based on a scenario solely consisting of metaphysics, and of metaphysics in its purest form: the question of the Self. But since then, especially in the genre of horror movies, we recognize more an more elements which go back to cybernetics, semiotics, non-Aristotelian logic and related topic. The generation of the movies before were restricted to Einsteinian physics. When 'Stars Wars' came to and end, when people got tired of traveling through the universe, BJM came, and people became more interested in traveling into the self. By the way, the Self is a universe of its own.However, what happens if you crawl into your own brain? Correctly speaking, the basic problem with the identity-eliminating corridor in the movie starts already when other people crawl into your brain: Do you realize that or not? It seems that Malkovich does not feel it. This would mean that he disposes of an alter ego with is not in communication with his ego. Furthermore, this alter ego is not recognizable for the subject as a (common) object. If this would be true, Malkovich would be unable to recognize himself as a subject, since not only can subjects recognize alter egos, they are even characterized by iterating themselves, thus creating subjects of subjects of subjects ... . So, if you crawl into your own brain, you correctly see - as depicted wonderfully in the movie - a large number of Yours who are yourself and at the same time not yourself. (Of course, since the tunnel is an identity-elimination device.) This idea, by the way, is from E.T.A. Hoffmann, mentioned in his diaries and henceforth quoted in many philosophical, psychological and psychiatric studies. Unfortunately, at that point, the movie stops (thematically), and it would be highly interesting to see how a director would deal with the fact that one person is dissolved into several egos without drifting into the false concept of schizophrenia. A logic, in which this splitting of individuality is possible, is a logic which transcends by far the Aristotelian light-switch logic and leads into a universe whose discovery will be infinitely more interesting than the time-travels through worm leaks or Einstein-Rosen-Bridges with which old-generation Science Fiction has entertained us during decades.",8,0,1,15 December 2009
The Game," The object of the game is not a part of the game
","According to Game Theory (a branch of mathematics), a game consists of a set of players, a set of moves (or strategies) available to those players, and a specification of payoffs for each combination of strategies. What make several non-mathematicians astonish in this definition is that nothing is said about the object of playing. From non-mathematical games we know that one can play with balls, chess-figures, straws (Halma), dominoes, etc. But what happens when one of the players become the object of the play or game? According to the above definition, then, he must know about the moves of the game, and also about the specification of payoffs for every move - in this special case also for his own moves and not only for those of the other players.This is, abstractly said, what 'The Game' (1997), a very intelligent and metaphysically deep movie, is about. Mr. Van Orton gets as a very special gift from his brother with whom he has a very problematic relationship, a gift which is on first sight nothing more than an entrance billet to a VIP-club. After Mr. Van Orton has filled in a very detailed questionnaire, the play starts - but without knowing him any parts which belong per definition to any game. As a matter of fact, the audience who does in this case not has the luck of the distant observer to be always at least one step in front of the protagonist, gets involved in the game, too, and without knowing that until just before the movie ends. Therefore, the game, which is based, both the main actor and for the watcher, on fully obscure rules, appears more like a dream, or better a nightmare, and the only question in the two hours of running time is: When and how will this nightmare end? In the end, however, one will see that a game which is based on the violation of all defining rules of what a game must be, has to follow enormously complex rules in order not to risk the life of the object of the game.",Null,0,0,17 October 2009
The Illusionist," The Autology of Illusionism
","Illusionism means basically that you must force yourself not to believe to be real what you see. However, for most people, this is a problem, because they define truth through their eye-sight: What I saw, is true, since I saw it (happen) with my own eyes. The whole witness-system of the world-wide police is based on this thoroughly illogical conception of truth. If you have the luck to meet an illusionist, what you see may be false because you see it with your own eyes - and opposite, it may be true because you must not believe in what you see.However, there is another problem, and nowhere it is portrayed in a more illustrious way than in 'The Illusonist' (2006): People who go to an illusionist's show, must assume from the beginning that what they will see is not true: the world 'illusion' alone says it. However, if what they see is so strikingly convincing to be true, but now true against their better knowledge, then these people must be able to come behind the trick by which falseness is presented so splendidly as truth. Now, the reality looks so, that most people are unable to find out the trick. The do not only see - they look and watch (intentionally) - and they do not find a hint, although they know (or believe to know?) that what they see is false - so does this prove now that what they see is true? Here lies the main root of the superstition of people: Because they are unable to find out which the trick is that lets them believe the falseness for truth and vice versa, they rather convince themselves that there is no trick and start to believe what they see - as they do normally because they define to be true what they see. The movie shows this so simple and at the same time so complex mechanism of truth and falseness in the context of Illusionism in such a way that the audience gets the other public of Eisenheim - together with his proper public in his theaters. After all, the whole movie is itself an illusion - in order to find out why, you will have to watch the end carefully. Thus, this movie is what is called in logic auto-logical.",10,0,2,23 October 2009
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Dance of Signs
","Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Salò' has been commented perhaps more than any other movie has. Yet, what is missing in all the commentaries I have read so far is the fact that this film was written and directed by a man who was in first line the founder of film semiotics and a professor of philosophy. Therefore, 'Salò' cannot be watched without sufficient knowledge of the science of the signs and its metaphysics. This, of course, turns this movie into a piece of art before an extremely high theoretical background. Hence, it is not a movie for everybody. Pasolini even went so far as to quote  like in scientific works  the sources that he used for his last movie: most of all Philippe Sollers' 'Numbers' and Roland Barthes' semiotic writings.According to semiotics, a sign represents reality, while reality presents itself. But since we cannot perceive reality without signs, we live in a semiotic world. A sign and its designated object, however, are always separated by a con-textural border: Signs never reach reality, but reality, on the other side, survives only in the signs that we perceive. Signs, therefore, dilute reality, and, as a result of this dissolution of reality, they become ambiguous. Or, to put it from the other side: it is only because of their ambiguity that signs preserve reality. The abyss between a sign and its eternally unreachable object is the very source of creativity. Even a photograph  an icon in the terminology of Charles Sanders Peirce  and thus the sign that is closest to its represented object  will never turn into this object, as, vice versa, the object itself can never be exchanged by its photograph, but photography would not be considered as art if there would not be creativity involved.And this is exactly what Pasolini demonstrates in his final movie: This allegedly cruel and gruel icons represent a reality by scooping out like in no other movie the creative potential in the con-textural abyss between signs and their objects. Watching the 'Salò', therefore, means watching behind the signs that we see in the movie. Pasolini leads us directly into this creative abyss, he creates a world out of this never-land, out of the nothing about which the German-American philosopher Gotthard Günther wrote that there is a world 'that God has not yet created'. It is, therefore, a world that has to be created by man, and this exactly involves all the cruelty that only mankind ever achieved: the torturing scenes, the eating of feces, the rapes, the executions. It is not by chance, either, that Pasolini divided 'Salò' into four circles: Here Sollers' non-Aristotelian number theory, Derrida's also non-Aristotelian work, Barthes' semiotics and Pasolini's 'Heretical Empricism' meet one another. For people without this background, 'Salò' appears as a museum of random historical absurdity, merging the Marquis De Sade's stories and the fascist practices of Mussolini that accompanied the film director's whole life.'Salò' urges the audience to watch behind the pictures, thus behind the signs. After all, this is exactly what metaphysics is about: behind the reality, here: behind the artistic and fragile reality of the signs: The signs could be exchanged by other signs, since their ambiguity create a theoretically infinite number of artistic worlds, and it was Nietzsche who said that metaphysics is acceptable only as an artistic one.This terrifyingly brilliant masterpiece I rate with 10 points.",10,13,23,13 April 2007
Downfall," Insights into the private life of Mr. A. Hitler
","It is a peculiarity of Germany that it produces, on the one side, uninterruptedly movies about the time of the National Socialism with the clear purpose of 'explaining the unexplainable', but, on the other side, it punishes and persecutes with the utmost severeness all those who try to have their own opinion about national socialism or some of their exponents. Exactly the latter happened to 'Der Untergang' (2004): Director Hirschbiegel was most heavily criticizes through weeks in the boulevard tableaux because he did not dissociate himself from the 'benevolent and favorable' picture that Traudl Junge (on whose memories the film is based) gave about her former boss Hitler. Indeed: Somebody who watches this movies without the burden of allegedly commonly borne (and 'suffered') past, he or she may sense Hitler as a bearer of sympathy: He does not drink nor smoke, eats only vegetarian and small-sized meals, drinks herb-tea and no coffee, is not pro miscue and loves animals and children over anything. Junge/Hirschbiegel also clearly differentiate (at various places of the movie) between 'the human A.H.' and 'Der Führer'.It seems to be forbidden, at least in Germany, that also a dictator (who was by the way correctly elected Reichskanzler) is a human being and not a monster from outer space. When recently multi-Oscar winning director Oliver Stone called Hitler a 'scapegoat' - whole Germany shook frightened its head. Had Stone been a German (or perhaps only in Germany to the time when he uttered that), the police would have arrested him because of 'belittlement' of war-crimes. Of course: Only about two years ago, famous and popular TV moderator and writer Eva Herman lost her job because she was telling in one of her shows that the children's care had been much better in the NS-time than it is in present-day Germany. Nothing else. When, again some years earlier, a chemist offered a court house to show his chemical proof that cyclone B could not possibly have been used in cold Auschwitz - he was arrested and sentences without even having been given the possibility to show his scientific proof. The same happened to a meanwhile whole bunch of scientists who have tried to shade light on some of the innumerable inconsistencies and contradictions of what happened or not happened between 1933 and 1945. Speaking nicely about Hitler is strongly forbidden in Germany, one just wonders that this movie has not been banned in Germany. The more one has to praise its director, not only for his great and admirable achievement, but mostly for his courage in a land where only that is accepted as 'truth' about the NS times which is accepted by Jewish historians.",10,1,4,16 January 2010
Raging Bull," Raging Nonsense
","As it seems, we live in a society, in which it is important enough to portrait the spiritually rather unimportant live of somebody, whose calling it was to knock down other people in a strange kind of activity, that has less to with sports, but much more with aggression. Since movies always portrait the time and the society in which we live and since the movie, that stands here under discussion, belongs to the 250 best rated movies ever, one must assume, that our society is as primitive as the topic of this movie.Doubtless, the acting capacity of Robert De Niro and, most of all, Joe Pesci, is admirable. But, if I am allowed here to try a kind of meta-comment: Somebody wrote, that this film 'will remain in my heart forever: the splendid black & white, the contrast between the slow moving scenes and the frenetic ones, the choice of the music and the sense of loss which entangles the whole movie'. At this point, I can only shake my head, because there are thousands of black and white movies, slow and 'frenetic' scenes, the choice of music reached its culmination point in Faßbinder's movies, but not in Scorsese's, and the sense of loss is a very prominent motive since the silent movie time. So, all this compliments have absolutely nothing to do with this special movie.Complete loss of common sense is reached at the moment, when this somebody writes: 'Martin Scorsese is the most poetic director of the last 30 years': What has boxing to do with poetry? Is there nowadays an 'aesthetics of boxing', perhaps an 'aesthetics of brutality'? And, after all, each movie must have a message, because otherwise, it is neither worth to film a story nor to watch such a movie. The 'Raging Bull' is a paradigmatic example of a movie without any recognizable message, hence a 'raging nonsense'.",1,15,56,15 August 2005
The Matrix," When virtual reality turns into real imagination
","Adding another comment of 'The Matrix' (1999) in addition to the over 2'000 almost published ones may seem pretentious. However, as it appears, most people have not understood that the 'matrix' is that what we, according to the movie, mistakenly take for 'the' reality. It is our ontology and our metaphysics, the space of the objects which we can meet during the trip of our life. But again according to the movie, this reality-matrix is nothing but an artificial construct produced by a computer program, so that it is this 'virtual' reality which produces our 'real reality'. In addition, also the programmers which have written these omnipotent programs, are nothing else but functions of the program itself. So, the program is operated by its programmers, but it also operates on the programmers. Such logical circularity is excluded from any science which is based on two-valued Aristotelian logic - and this all kind of science we are able to technically realize by now. Insofar, this movie is 'Science Fiction', but in a good sense of the term.However, there is one of these long monologues of Laurence Fishburn-Morpheus where he gives for Keanu Reeve's character - and the audience - detailed metaphysical commentaries about the relationship of the two levels of reality, the seemingly real reality produced by the matrix and the indeed 'real' virtual reality. Here, one has to say that at least for Morpheus, the 'real' (i.e. non-virtual) reality must actually exist, because it serves him as a reference-basis for his explications of the virtual reality which produced the 'real' matrix-reality. If it would not, then even Morpheus could not differentiate, let's say, if the 'virtual hull' of a crew-member of his or his actual 'realy body' has died. Multiplying the traditional one-reality-ontology and metaphysics does not let dissolve this latter concepts, in the opposite, the more realities are constructed, the more important the 'real' reality gets as a basis of reference. The reason is that we cannot perceive a priori objects of any reality without 'filtering' them with our senses, so we perceive them as signs - and those are, by their very nature, always interpreted. Thus, any reality is already interpreted reality and therefore needs a Tertium Comparationis for the sake of comparison and thus reference. Everything else would be a nightmare which would dissolve the human brain long before being able to create such fantasy worlds.",8,0,1,8 September 2009
