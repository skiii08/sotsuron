Sucker Punch," If you like the Music, you'll like the Movie
","Michelle Pfeiffer once commented that 'the Music adds 50% to a Movie.' If you do the math, that means that about one-third of the Movie experience is comprised of the Music.Although this film takes quite a few risks, the choice of Music is not at all risky, but rather consists of some tried and true classics: tunes immortalized by the Eurythmics, Roxy Music, Queen, the Beatles, the Smiths, Sugarcubes, Jefferson Airplane and Iggy Pop--plus some Mozart.A pleasant twist includes performances of some of the songs by cast members Emily Browning and Carla Gugino.Otherwise, the formula for the film is a fairly straightforward 'Video Game' theme with the usual array of young and hot female action heroines: three with the 'Skinny Blonde Look' that everyone in Hollywood loves (Emily Browning, Jena Malone and Abbie Cornish) and two with the currently popular 'Exotic Raven-Haired' beauty (Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung).So check it out if you like the Music, if you like Video Games, and if you like hot women in the roles of action heroines.",8,1,3,19 May 2013
