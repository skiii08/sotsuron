The Avengers," A Must see!! I find few problems and plenty of funny moments for the sci fi kind of guys! ;)
","I love this film! it is funny, packed with action and story is easy to follow. Best set of warriors with real potential together all work together to bring down evil that is out of this world! :D MY perfect film! I love Iron man, I love captain America, I love The Hulk, i love it all! The film has good use of CGI. it has good action scenes that no one is better than the other...they are all good in their unique way. this makes the film so unique because it packs in the best actor with a great story in a good set! With every film there are problems. Some of these are quite obvious to the human eye. Firstly how does the start work? the starting point was quite confusing and very different, :( just got me wondering....why this world? but after you pass that the film seems to have few flaws and good parts! so i definitely would recommend this to a friend or two and it would be a nice family film too.My conclusion is that it would get a suitable 9/10 from me. I want to give it more but i just would not give it a ten. Not everyones film. :) thanks for reading and happy reviewing! :D",10,12,24,4 December 2012
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Absolutely hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",Hilarious......no other word can describe this film! I've seen it many times and it still makes me laugh. It just is crazy and silly. enough so to make you laugh out loud! Yes there are some really weird bits including the alien spaceship out of nowhere....whats all that about? :P but hey it just keeps getting more and more stupidly funny. i would say a definite Nine out of ten. i wouldn't go for a ten out of ten because it isn't everybody's sort of film. but i wouldn't give it an eight because i still love it all the same. difficult one but a good film indeed. i wouldn't say its a must see though purely because it its not the kind of film that id show everyone or have a film night it with friends its not that kind of film. But i do like to express my view about it. Good film if you have got it but i wouldn't really buy it. A Definite 9/10 though no question! thanks for reading and happy reviewing :),9,0,2,4 December 2012
"Monsters, Inc."," Good funny film! :D
","I love this film! Funny, nice story, sweet and it is overall a clever film! it works and it has all the characters fit their character type! you see Randal as the slimy monster thats evil and Sully as a big cuddly blue monster that has more heart than Scare! This film stands out as a funny animated short film that people of all ages can smile about. Take for instance Mike Wasouski for instance...he gets the worst things happen to him and yet he still manages to smile and make more people laugh about his funny comments! A very good film but there are problems like in any film. some of these are certain flaws and graphic impossibilities. one of which is when the door handles are one side in one picture and in another picture the door handle is the opposite side...:( hmmm good luck with that. But if you want a funny and family film this is one i would recommend. Id would give this a 10 but i feel it doesn't quite deserve a ten so if i could id give it a 9.5. Hope this helps and thanks for reading! Happy reviewing! :D",9,0,1,4 December 2012
The Dark Knight," Good film and Good fun...
","Hi guys, First of all let me say i love this film!! :D BUT...this film isn't for everybody. I know some people who dislike this film. but this is my review so i shall do it about what i think.... This film is great for a night in with your friends. i love watching these kind of films they always interest me and i feel as though i am a piece of the action! The attention to detail they put in is fantastic and the action from all the characters is very good and the characters themselves i am pleased with. BUt a downside is (sigh) Harvey Dent. The part where he changes his mind about things and turns the other cheek....quite literally....it is very predictive. All To easy by my say. Another thing is why did we think that batman was only doing good? bit difficult but overall VERY GOOD! Im glad to rate this as a 9/10",9,0,4,27 November 2012
Taken," I am 'TAKEN' a back by how god this film is!
","Probably one of my favourite films I've seen! I love every second of it! The Action, the small parts of comedy, the strength of characters, the use of characters! the whole film is very easy to understand, it has a clear story and good use of actors. only one bad thing to mention. why start with the book of photos? little bit confusing. i really do like this film. you just know what hes thinking but in a way that you cannot predict his moves. you really get to like his action for his daughter and that no compromise or any change will make him change his mind. he is on a mission and he knows how to prove his point! specially with a gun pointed at Jeane Claude :P correct me if i have spelt that wrong! He clearly knows what he is doing but he cannot do everything in an instant. there are parts where timing is key. if i had to describe one it would be when he waited for a chance to get inside the apartment and find out clues to find out where his daughter went. it went from small clue to other small clue. really fantastic story! :D My OPINION i love this film it has good action, easy story and fantastic finish! I really recommend this film and i love the way it has its ups and downs but it all ends with a good finish. :) Thanks guys and happy reviewing!",10,1,4,27 November 2012
Avatar," Great film! Plenty of fun and from my eyes a great story!
","One word from me that suits it perfectly 'EPIC'! its exactly my kind of film! Bit of Scifi bit of action, a good story that you can understand and overall an unforgettable film. Good use of CGI and good use of actors who suit it perfectly. I love the way they accept all sorts of people on this film and it all works like clockwork! It works well and has a lasting story that you cant predict but feel like you already know type thing... if you understand. :P Couple of bad parts in the film but i shall only write a few. One problem is that why after all this time we happen to be the invaders and we know better and we have unbeatable technology but we still lose thanks to one individual? hmm bit lost there. Overall a Good Film. I find i can watch it anytime and still enjoy it. Magical ingredients and actors make this a great film to watch! A well Deserved 10/10 i think! thanks for reading and happy reviewing!",10,5,10,4 December 2012
Inception," Confusing, boring but good story.
","If i am completely honest i found this film a little boring and the first time i watched it i found myself completely confused. Yes, it has a good story but i guess it isn't my kind of film. I would recommend it to a friend but it would only be if they asked me how it was. in one scene a Train comes out of nowhere? i didn't get it even after the third time of watching it!!! :/ BUT...i speak to a lot of people who really like it and i respect their views on it. I myself really like the characters played n this film and think it suited them perfectly but the film didn't suit me. Thanks for reading, I'm not the best critic or analyser but i like to prove my opinion. A good six out of ten i would say. Have Sweet Dreams Tonight! :P",6,0,5,27 November 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Good film BUT......
",Hi There. I must say tat i did like this film. i loved the actors and i loved the story. the action was good and so was the Special effects. All round a good film....Not The best but still a good film! :) But here is my problem. it did not exceed or live up to my expectations...the film got given so much hype that i thought it would be the best movie of 2012 t it was unnecessary hype. :( it really let me down watching this film and seeing some of the fighting scenes made me smile but it didn't cover the disappointment. i thought that i had found a good film - i did i suppose! but all I'm saying is that it doesn't deserve all the hype it gets. BUT do not get me wrong this film is great! :D It has amazing story and a Good set of actors. i like the way it all works and fits in. one more thing before i go...This movie is (and i regret thinking this but) it is ... predictable. as soon as i heard and knew BANE i knew that the name BANE means high servant of a higher person. therefore the only person Who Stood Out So Objectively was she. i almost knew the plot from the beginning. Kind of sad really....Used the story a few to many times in films nowadays. Sorry and sad to say that id give this film .... a seven? maybe thats a wee bit harsh. :( thanks guys for reading! happy reviewing! :D,7,2,4,4 December 2012
