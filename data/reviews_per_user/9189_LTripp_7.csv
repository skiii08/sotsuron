Ghost," Extremely Good!
","This is a must see movie. The movie fits with practically every Genre. It's sad, funny, romantic, and violent. It takes place in some of the roughest places in New York, that is clear when you see the buildings in the inside of a house. The lead characters are Sam(Patrick Swayze) and Molly(Demi Moore). They arevery much in love but when Sam is killed right before Molly's eyes by Willie(Rick Avilles), who turns out to the hitman and Sam's best friend Carl(Tony Goldwyn), Sam's ghost knows he has work to do before he goes to Heaven. He  discoversOda Mae Brown(Whoopi Goldberg), who is the only person who can hear hisvoice. And he manages to annoy her into trying to convince Molly to believe that Sam is telling her to watch out for the murderers. Molly struggles with whether or not to believe her because Oda Mae mentions private things between her andSam. Patrick Swayze is very charmingly romantic, Whoopi Goldberg is veryfunny, and Tony Goldwyn is an awesome bad guy.",10,12,15,4 June 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Spectacular!
","This movie is great! Johnny Depp is so funny as pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is very romantic as Will Turner the blacksmith. Geoffrey is so evil as the skeleton Captain Barbosa. Keira Knightley is gorgeous and she doeswell in the movie as Elizabeth Swann, daughter of Governor Swann(JonathanPryce who is always good). You've got to see it. Don't let the fact that thedistributor is Walt Disney stop you. This movie is rated PG-13. As a matter of fact this is the first PG-13 movie that was released by Disney rather than Touchstone which is connected to Disney and has always released the high budget adultfilms that Disney produces.",10,0,1,30 July 2003
The Bourne Identity," Matt Damon is no action guy
","This movie rates a 2 because it at least has a plot. But Matt Damon just makes the movie really bad! He can't do an action flick. He is too cute, he is notmuscular, he is the kind of actor that girls fall for because he's soft, rather than James Bond because he's hard. The other problem is that Matt's character,Jason Bourne is a mix of good and evil, and that works for a Drama like forinstance the ten performances I have seen as William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet',but not for an action flick like this.",2,3,6,11 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Masterpiece!
","You are not likely to find a movie this excellent. I am in the middle of reading the books. I already know that there are many cut out characters and events in the movie, from the books. But a lot of it they had to remove. It's more true to the books than the Harry Potter movies and also required a lot more work. All the actors are great, among the best are Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Bean,Sean Astin, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, and Hugo Weaving. I was so upsetwhen this movie lost the award for Best Picture. You must see this movie.",10,1,2,21 May 2003
The Patriot," A Brilliant War Epic!
","Unless you are sensitive to too much brutal and bloody violence you've got to see this movie. Mel Gibson does a good job as Col. Benjamin Martin, a malicia leader. Heath Ledger does even better as Martin's son Gabriel. Chris Coopergives a very good performance as Col. Harry Burwell, an old friend of Martin's. And on the English side Tom Wilkinson plays the real life General LordCornwalis, Jason Isaacs gives one of the best wicked, evil performances I'veseen as Col. William Tavington, who kills two of Martin's sons and is his enemy to the end. I couldn't compare it to the event on which it is based because I only study American history at school because I have to and I don't know too muchabout it. But whether it is true to it or not, you will probably enjoy it!",10,0,4,5 May 2003
Ice Age," Terrible!!!!!
",This movie is terrible! I hated it so much! The music is terrible! The story is terrible! The script is terrible! The characters are terrible! The animation is terrible! The voice acting is terrible! DO NOT see this movie unless you have very very very little kids.,1,3,19,11 May 2003
Gangs of New York," A good adventure, but not deep enough
","I gotta say I enjoyed the adventure of the film. The fight scenes are good. I think the movie should have won the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Original Song. But the problem is that the characters are all punks. And I suppose they all were at that time but I think most people have humanity, compassion, and mercy in them. Even toward their enemies and certainly toward each other. Yes there was a little between the good guys. But they feel such pride in fighting and if you feel that much pride and that little compassion after war then there is something wrong with you. This is supposed to be a movie about horrific things happening to good people and these people weren't good even though not all of them were bad. In fact the only two characters that were nothing but evil were Boss Tweed and Bill the Butcher. How can you feel sorry for them if they are not good? You could say the same thing about most Arnold Schwarzenegger movies but this movie is supposed to be showing how horrible this really was and it doesn't. But like I said it's a good adventure, but it is a bad drama. So some people get excited by this film. It has three great actors in it, Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Jim Broadbent. And many more who are popular. So I wouldn't say don't ever see this movie. I'd watch it if I was just flipping through.",Null,0,1,9 May 2004
