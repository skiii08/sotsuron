Alien 3," Did these filmmakers even watch the first 2?
","SPOILERS WITHIN---------------No one liked and appreciated Alien and Aliens more than I...period. So when Alien 3 was released, I was at the theater on opening day. As I left the theater a short time later, I can remember thinking only one thing. What the Hell were they thinking? Let's kill off the child and hero from Aliens that we all fell in love with like they didn't exist or deserve recognition? Let's replace realistic creature effects with bad cartoonish computer animation? Let's make this film so dark and with identical looking characters that no one can tell who is who other than by their individual bad acting styles? Let's kill off the main character? I wish I could sum my disappointment with something more mature but if the shoe fits...this movie is a piece of sh--!!!!!!!!!1/10",1,501,544,10 September 2003
Fight Club," Just see it with no distractions and you'll be glad you did.
","So few movies make you sit up and say 'WOW'. This does that and more. Great writing,visuals and an ending still not beaten by any other film. Smart, entertaining and just plain cool. Don't even think that this is an action movie or just a guy flick. Trust me. 9/10",10,0,1,10 September 2003
Closer," Painfully bad ....prepare to say 'who cares?' A lot!
","Saying this movie has anything to offer other than as a sleep inducer is an understatement. If you enjoy watching lying, cheating, foul-mouthed (for no reason)people with no redeeming qualities fight and converse endlessly....this is your movie! Don't let movie critic wanna-bes make you think this is anything but what it is.....bad. Between jumping through time and leaving out important plot points (if you care...which you won't) to an ending which leaves you both confused and ambivalent at the same time. The photography and music is average at best and only Natalie Portman's beauty keeps your eyes open temporarily. I was able to see it for free and I still felt ripped off. OK..I am done now. Thanks for listening.",1,2,3,11 April 2005
The Bourne Identity," Finally a good, different, believable spy thriller
","Guess what? Not everybody read this book. Some of us just went to the movies and said 'entertain me' and this movie did. Great story, action, characters, fight scenes, driving, scenery, music and pacing. I look forward to the sequel or sequels. 9/10",10,2,4,10 September 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," proof that only James Cameron can make a Terminator movie
","Wow....what a waste of film and my time. The difference between T2 and T3 is incredible. one has strong acting, good effects, clever and smart dialog with humor injected at just the right time....and one has none of these things!!!!!! Effects are supposed to get better with time , not worse! Didn't anyone watch this before they released it and say 'Is this a parody or a sequel'? Major disappointment on all levels. Save your money and pretend T-2 was the final movie. You'll be happier. 1/10",7,4,8,16 November 2003
BASEketball," Clever, Funny and truthful...plus T & A too!
","Sometimes I just want to laugh. Don't you? No analyzing, no critiquing and no looking for deeper meaning. Rent this movie, watch it all and laugh your ass off. Don't want to admit you liked it? Fine. But don't trash it here when you and I both know you liked it. It's Damn funny!",10,0,2,10 September 2003
Legends of the Fall," beautifully mesmerizing
","Very few epics make you feel this emotionally rocked as this film. Between it's incredible soundtrack (still the best and worth buying on it's own), the best scenery to date, and the fact that it's many intertwining stories come together so perfectly, no film in recent memory gives so much for your time. This is a great film. As for the few 'movie critic wannabes' that believe only trashing a film with sarcasm and a thesaurus will get you noticed...your all idiots. Though your comments are noted, they are quickly discarded by anyone with intelligence. 9/10",10,4,7,14 September 2003
