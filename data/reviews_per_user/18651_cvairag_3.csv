Blade Runner 2049," Drowned in the subtext
","Interesting as the set design and the cinematography of BR2049 were, the current generation will eventually learn that what makes a movie great is not loud and glossy special effects, 'surprises', clever romantic play, endless laughs, nor hours of fist fighting, sex, nor truly ghastly horror, nor ghastly car wrecks, but whether or not the story honestly moves you, how deeply, and why. This last quintessential must be achieved on screen in the final minute, or few seconds, of the film. The final frame is the ultimate twist which ties the theme (claim, premise, argument), the plot, the lessons the characters and ourselves had to learn, and their fate into a perfect, eternal, square knot. Voila!
If this moment, the ending, is, in any way, blown, the word 'masterpiece' cannot be applied. Few films indeed deserve such an accolade, since this moment, the always elusive, satisfying, tear-worthy ending, is ever more difficult to achieve in the increasingly jaded, cynical, narrow, desperate, inhumane view of the contemporary audience. Few there are who cry in movie theaters these days, a throw-back to a simpler time, as the feature film, as the movie is now referenced, has ceded to the long running T.V. series, Breaking Bad, et al, the primary platform for the narrative constructs which really move our society.
When cornered by one of the characters in Adaptation, on one level, undoubtedly Charlie Kaufman's brilliant polemic on screenwriting, no less stern a critic than Robert McKee is asked to give his criteria for a great film in less than thirty seconds. His response: 1) a great ending; 2) the characters must change.
The ending of BR2049 is a mess, vague to the point of incoherence, and dependent on a line of subtext that none but the most devout Blade Runner fan could follow. I was neither moved nor edified. The subtext throughout the film was so complex, obscure, and overbearing, that whatever attempt to develop character is drowned along with most of the bad guys. Ryan Gosling's figure, named 'Joe' late in the story, is I think supposed to evolve in what early on becomes a existential (lol) - I mean he's a replicant, right? Or not? Boy that brings on some heavy meditating on what it 'means' to be human - search for the self embedded in a good old cops and robbers, good guy chases down the bad guys - maybe... By the final frame I still couldn't figure out who was human - who was replicant - and why this highly speculative, trite picture of an unfortunately imagined future - where liquor seems to be the only substance binding humanity together - had any significance for me the viewer. That's what I mean by coherence. 
Please forgive the unpolished musings of a 'toe tapping' dolt as one reviewer puts it - but I still do not see why I should contemplate this particular picture rather than another to answer the question of what it 'means to be human'? What about a movie poses the same question but against a backdrop simple reality such as Kurosawa's humbling masterpiece Ikiru 'To Live'? What greater final frame could ever be shot?
The problem with most sci-fi dystopian futuristic narratives is that every imagined detail must be accounted for and rarely are. Who says that we'll be living on a diet of holographically disguised maggots living on excrement, as is suggested by BR2049, and why? Reviewers rightly complain of multiple script 'holes', even 'craters' in BR2049, but it is the glaring subjectivity of their presumptions about what the future will be, common to most all of these narratives that gives one the feeling that they are wasting our time. We and 1984 seem to be the only specimens of the genre which escape this fatal flaw because in every instance the creators have found credible, cogent, and coherent ways to link the possible details of the imagined future to our current reality.
And what does the reviewer with the temerity to parade as a professional critic call a 'smart script'? Hundreds of pages long without meeting one widely agreed upon criteria for greatness or even basic structure or character development, a script which if anonymously entered into a screenwriting contest would hit the circular file in the first round, an insult to the very idea of craft.
The script actually did have a rather healthy gut full of humor even when unaware of it, I suspect - anyway a relief from the ongoing din of the army of tympanis. But the only time I heard the audience laugh was when Deckard dumped out a little booze which his dog preceded to lap off the floor. I kept trying to figure out how Deckard and the dog ate for all those years after the nuclear holocaust - they both looked sort of chubby - but unlike another reviewer, I'm not going to rush back for another viewing because I'm tortured by it all. I'm not.",2,2,3,25 January 2018
Nightcrawler," Best LA Film Noir To Date?
","When few people we're talking about Nightcrawler, a film that was somewhat initially buried by its release date, I was lamenting that this masterpiece (one of the few American films that have banged my bells in the past decade) barely took home any hardware, while overpriced, badly acted and directed mediocrities were being regularly feted. Well, since the advent of 'fake news' as political jargon that's all changed as the streamers and the dvd crowd has caught up with a film not as shocking to me in its content, but in its level of excellence in almost every category of film making.
Needless to say, Gyllenhaal's noted performance represents the ne plus ultra portrait of the conflicted antagonist as protagonist, no easy feat. The guy is simply one of the best players of his generation, and yet, still remains somehow a bit under the radar, perhaps because he is far more artist than celebrity, unlike others, too numerous to mention.
What does disturb me still however is what I consider to be a general misunderstanding, on the part of the United States of Amnesia's filmgoing public to what the film is really about. First, I do not see Nightcrawler as a psychological study. It is a crime film. But who's buying this stuff? The public.
What Nighcrawler is theme wise is an on point dissection of the horrors of unregulated capitalism and the misguided ethos of of the one-dimensional desperate quest for profit (subsistence in the environment of radically inflated cost of living) as they spill down to the millennial generation through the internet, which becomes almost a character in the narrative, at once Lou's mentor and his alter-ego - like Lear's Fool leading him onto increasingly further depths of depravity in the wasteland of the world of the L.A. night. After all, this is what it takes to establish a successful business, from scratch no less, is it not?
In what is in many opinions the state of the art in scripts, this message is entirely driven home by the subtext in a tale that becomes considerably more than the taut specimen of L.A. Film Noir it presents itself as. Both understated and over-the-top, Nightcrawler deals with some of our most firmly entrenched and divisive social problems at a time when the fabric of our society is severely threatened and does not flinch in its facility for speaking truth to power. A great film, when there are few worth watching.",10,1,1,29 January 2019
The Truman Show," One of the Greatest Films Ever Made - A Masterpiece by Any Standard
","One of the few Hollywood produced films that WILL stand the test of time as ART - high ART - I'm talk'in Ugetsu, Ikiru, Seventh Seal - the rarefied air - the 'I've been to the mountaintop' of cinematic art...Now - what happened with the public reception? Many of our nation's best critics realized to one extent or another how great the film was - perhaps not as much its prophetic nature - which, if you saw it originally in the theater - you might try viewing it again - to see.The featured review is on the right track. 1998 was a bumper crop year for Hollywood film - yet, few in Hollywood seemed to realize it. True, Carry's goofy reputation, if somewhat deserved, caused many to miss the point - but, at the end of the day, all of the latent denial in the American psyche - specifically catered to by the Hollywood elite - produced the most blatant Oscar night debacle in a long history of this tragically repeated motif - great art once again denied the laurel wreath in deference to crass commercialism - in this case two of the greatest English language films ever made, The Truman Show and American History X, shunted in favor of a shameless piece of fluff based on dubious if not downright dishonest premises, Joseph Fiennes' vaunted backside, and the rather gauchely revolting nepotistic spectacle of Gwynnie dancing with Daddy...Truly, the American public really did not get The Truman Show - it got by most of us - perhaps, it requires repeated viewings - such an incisive critique of the American psyche as it is - where even the most sacred things are trampled under our incessant self-created need for security and the lies we're willing to tell ourselves to perpetuate it. The final conversation between Truman and his life-long 'friend', Marlin, is imo one of the greatest scenes ever filmed - revealing the depth of the corruption of our wayward civilization - enough to make Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor blush with shame.Weir has made a number of very good+++ films: Dead Poets Society, Last Wave, Witness... but...THIS IS HIS MATERPIECE A FILM ONE SHOULD SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN. NOT MERELY VG+++ : GREAT.",10,0,1,12 July 2013
