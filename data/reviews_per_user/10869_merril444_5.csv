The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Bit disappointing...
","I adore Twilight, loved the books & the movies so far. However, I am very glad that it has been so long since I read Breaking Dawn, as I was disappointed with this movie as it stood. It was too slow & too simplistic for my taste. Just as the pace starts to pick up, the movie ends!  So I loved the last 10 minutes or so. The rest? Enjoyable but not fantastic. I was ready to be blown away but I wasn't. My expectations were just too high.I think this film suffered from producers' greed. With some good editing, the first half of the movie could have been trimmed down enough so the book was encompassed in one movie instead of two, albeit a much longer one. No question that wouldn't have been as big a cash cow of course! And money is the name of the game.I also found Stephanie Meyer's cameo at the wedding gratuitous. What an ego! She looked like she was giving the union her benevolent blessing. Pleeeeease!",5,16,34,16 November 2011
Taken," Action packed!
","Liam Neeson was great in this movie. At times I was reminded of John McClane and Jason Bourne characters, but with more seriousness & focus. As happens with many films of this genre, you have to suspend your belief somewhat as this quasi-superhero appears bulletproof!Some intermittent subtitles could have fleshed out the bad guys characters a little, making them less one dimensional without detracting from the suspense, while keeping the audience in the loop.A miscast Maggie Grace tried to downplay her age without success. Watching her run was reminiscent of a baby giraffe taking it's first steps. There are many younger actresses out there who can play the ingénue more convincingly. The violence can be gruesome and the sex-trade scenes sickening. But overall, this movie delivers and is well worth watching.",8,1,3,27 August 2008
La La Land," Blah Blah Land
","I was so disappointed with this movie. I adore old Hollywood musicals, but if this was supposed to be a 'tipping of the hat' in tribute to them, then I'm afraid the hat fell off & was trampled by a stampede of cinema goers exiting the theatre demanding a refund! How on earth did it win so many awards? A raspberry I'd believe, but the others? Sheesh!The story line was slow & boring. I'm a big fan of Emma Stone but in this movie she looked thin & unwell. Her singing & dancing were terrible. She was about as graceful as a newborn giraffe. I can't believe the wonderful Mandy Moore choreographed this drivel. I'm not a fan of Ryan Gosling so his performance didn't disappoint as I already had low expectations. There was nothing memorable about this film. Below average. Thank goodness I saw it for free or I'd be stomping on that hat myself!",2,4,6,14 September 2017
War of the Worlds," Fails to live up to expectations.
","What a huge disappointment. It seems that the bigger the advertising budget, the worse the movie! The ending was appalling and a total let down. Tom Cruise is wooden and unsympathetic. I didn't care whether he lived or died. Dakota Fanning overacts her little heart out, which is a shame as she is normally great. With such a woefully thin plot, the special effects were just not good enough to carry this film. About the only thing I did like was the sound effect that let the viewer know that an alien tripod was nearby (similar effect to a pending shark attack in 'Jaws'). I think Steven Spielberg made this one by numbers, as his usual creativity was sadly lacking. Worth a look when the DVD has been discounted, otherwise don't waste your money.",3,6,10,27 July 2005
The Greatest Showman," Exceeded Expectations
","I really enjoyed this movie. The critics didn't love it, but they loved La La Land, which I found to be a huge snore fest. There you go - proof you should listen to movie goers & not movie critics!The music was fabulous. If you were expecting songs to reflect the era, think again. They were modern, catchy & uplifting. I left the cinema wanting to get my hands on the soundtrack.I also loved the choreography. The same choreographer did La La Land but any similarity ends there (praise be!). Costumes were colourful, adding to the ambiance of the film.Yes, the storyline may have been a bit thin & predictable, but hey - it's a musical. My only real criticism was the CGI elephants - they were not well done.",8,0,1,6 January 2018
