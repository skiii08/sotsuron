Requiem for a Dream," Intense, gruelling yet very very enjoyable.
","<<Spoiler Free Zone!>>This Movie left me numb.. it was as if Darren Aronofsky had somehow managed to reach inside my body and squeeze my innards! This fantastic film left me emotionally drained and shattered but is an experience that I'm glad I didn't miss. Although the main characters are essentially quite repugnant you cannot help but begin to empathise with them. As the movie progresses and the tone darkens they drag you down into the abyss with them, only releasing you for air again when the credits roll. See this film, It will upset you, it will challenge you, it will change you.I rate this movie 10/10(p.s. speaking from experience.. I would advise you not to attempt to watch this movie and 'Old Boy' within a week of each other.. I did and it wasn't a pleasant experience!)",10,0,1,7 December 2004
