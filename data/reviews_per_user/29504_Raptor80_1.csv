Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice movie, loved that Jar-Jar Binks!
","Hey! I think this was a great film for teens - like me - it's not like the other Star Wars at all - which makes it good. The best part, i think, was that Jar-Jar! Who-wee was he great! I know a lot of people thought him annoying, but personally i think i've fallen in love =) anyways, bye!",10,0,0,21 May 1999
