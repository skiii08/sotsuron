The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," BoRING SeT Up OF THe NeXT Film
","Other reviewers have done well to highlight the obvious in that this movie is a boring prologue to the next Hunger Games film. Jennifer Lawrence looked like she was recovering from a hangover throughout most the movie and seemed overly melodramatic in parts. Her acting skills seemed weak in this movie and at times she looked as bored as I was watching the movie. This movie just does not work in its two part format. The previous two movies has well rounded stories and build up of characters but in this movie the story was jumping all over the place. Although I applaud the directors focus on the different elements of war i.e propaganda, rescue missions, bombing raids I found some of scenes of Katniss with her old flame and friend boring and dead. The movie seemed pretty thin on the use of SFX which I attribute to the saving of the budget for the second part of the movie. So don't expect any action like the other two movies. Ultimately this movie is a slow boil set up for the second and final installment of the series. You could probably watch a 5 min overview of what happens in this movie before watching the second part when it is released and save yourself a boring 2 hours of watching Jennifer Lawrence moaning away.",3,5,6,2 May 2015
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," Fun Loud and Silly just like Eurovision
","I know the critics have been saying the latest Will Farrel offering was a tad lame but in this Covid environment a bit of off fun, silly song and dance is really what is needed!
Some of the jokes full flat and the accents are dodgy but it's just a fun story that you can sing a long to and forget any sense of age or logic to the relationships!
There is a sense of the magic of Iceland that shines through and it's just a nice story.
So I would ask the critics 'WHY SO SERIOUS?'",7,0,0,28 June 2020
Point Break," Stunts are amazing, story is shite
","I was curious to see how they could build upon the original Point Break with all the modern tech of today, visually I was amazed at the stunts and beautiful filming locations - however the story is really a big let down.The plausibility of how the whole film comes together is quite unbelievable. Its a bit like they thought of the stunts and then somehow had to figure out a story to connect the dots. It is that obviousYou do not really get to see any character development at all. To me the biggest loop hole that you just cannot ignore is that the main protagonist is established as a great free style motor cross driver however when needed he is also somehow a pro surfer, wing-suit specialist, free style snowboarder, naked (no rope) cliff climber. Sorry - you do not just need an absence of fear to do some of those activities you need quite a bit of training and preparation. Naked cliff climbing requires tremendous upper body strength you would definitely need to do a hell of a lot of climbs to achieve that.In summary this film is a great excuse to show some daredevil stunts and amazing locations with a bit of product placement to boot. However today most of this can be found on YouTube - For Freeeeeeee",5,2,3,5 June 2016
Concussion," Good Ethical Dilemma Movie
","If your in for a movie that explains what happens when you choose the moral and ethical path then this is a good movie fro you.I thought the performances of Will Smith and others were quite good. I had to adjust to Will Smiths Nigerian accent for his character, however I think he played his character well. I like how the screen writers and directors focused on those who suffered as well. Focusing on their loss and betrayal. The relationship between Will and his on screen wife was a bit dry for me and seemed forced. It was quite a distraction from the rest of the movie. It seems like they edited parts out from the final cut. The timeline of the movie can be hard to follow at times. With scenes of family life then jumping to talking to doctors and examining bodies. Overall a well presented bi optic that could have done with a bit less editing.",7,1,3,7 June 2016
Nightcrawler," Great balanced movie - Jake really gets into character
","This movie was well done - I found the director balanced the tension, action, drama really well.Jake really gets into character well, all actors and actress play their parts so well you can really believe you are just watching events as they happen. Great insight into a world of freelance journalism and understanding of how they market the material. Good balance of tension, great camera work on the cars, the scenes and characters faces. Nice - nuff said",8,0,1,17 May 2015
Avengers: Endgame," Hmmmmmm that's a NO from me!
","There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down.
I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring.
Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers.
And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down.",6,12,21,2 May 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Just what I expect from a Marvel Movie
","There seems to be a lot of people who say this movie was bland - I personally think they were expecting too much from the Marvel format. You should go to a Marvel movie knowing that it will contain the following ingredients:1. Superheros who kick bad guy butt2. Bad guys who make no strategic sense in their decisions even given their supposed super intelligence. 3. Lots of cheesy dialogue and jokes.4. Enemy weapons of mass destruction that seem to take a long time to 'power up' before destruction. 5. Cameos, tie-ins and links to other movies in the Marvel franchise.I agree this is a tied formula but its great brain dead entertainment which is fun for the whole family. Action, well timed saves and cheesy jokes all round.",7,8,18,1 May 2015
The Water Diviner," Overly Melodramatic, Unrealistic but a good drama for the wife
",Maybe I am cynical but I could see this movie was made to cash in on the 100 year anniversary of ANZACS fighting in Gallipoli. Focusing in on the fathers plight to find his boys - sort of like Saving Private Ryan but after the war has happened. Somehow when he arrives in 1920's Turkey he happens upon a boy who can speak English as well as his mother who is pretty and speaks English - so it was no surprise that love would develop between the two characters. He also happens upon a 'friendly' Turkish general who happens to know where his boys fought. Pretty lucky string of events even for a movie.I found it weird that the main character uses his Water Diviner skills to find the bodies of his boys and this is not really explained??? what is he now able to channel the supernatural??? don't take me to be totally heartless there were touching scenes of the movie such as the bond of the brothers in Gallipoli I just found that this movie was over melodramatic and the events that happen seem very unrealistic that would fall in place as they did.,5,2,8,10 May 2015
Da 5 Bloods," Grandpa Gangstas in the Jungle
","GOOD: An interesting perspective on Vietnam warBAD: From an editing perspective this movie is all over the place and not in a good way... random flashbacks, random black power interludes.Music on certain scenes is over the top - Waaaay over the top! This ruins the whole movieThe story is nothing new - shallow characters of Vietnam ... PTSD all roundThe constant Gangsta talk is tiring",2,2,4,21 June 2020
Warm Bodies," Good Start :-) .......................Poor Finish :-(
",Warm Bodies opened quite cleverly with humorous dialog and an understanding of characters. However the direction of both the story and humor seemed to go only downhill from there. Ultimately in the end the combination of zombie horror genre and romantic humor just did not seem to mix well. Shuan of the Dead is an fantastic example of a mix of genre done well (Zombie Horror and Humor) and has a good build up of characters.Warm Bodies provided characters that were shallow stereotypical teen types and really everyone just seemed to shallow to care about. I must give credit to the FX peps who did the Skelton Zombies they looks scary and if the movie had involved more action it may have been better.,5,1,1,7 January 2015
