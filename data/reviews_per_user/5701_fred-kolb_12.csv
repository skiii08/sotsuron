Angels & Demons," A thrilling action flick, that improves on 'The Da Vinci Code'
","--Some minor spoilers, skip the part that describes the plot if you don't want to know anything about it--Angels and Demons, Good and Evil, Science and Faith. The title of the movie adaptation of Dan Brown's novel from 2000 allows for many interpretations, literally and figuratively. But the real question about the film is whether it overcame the demons of its predecessor 'The Da Vinci Code', which was panned by critics, despite becoming a huge financial success. Ironically 'The Da Vinci Code' was much more popular in its printed form than 'Angels and Demons', but yet the later one turned out to be the better film.From the CERN Laboratories in Switzerland a canister containing a new, dangerous substance called anti-matter is removed and the head scientist brutally murdered. After the death of the pope and on the day of the Conclave, where the cardinals come together to elect the new head of the Catholic church, the four favorites for the post are kidnapped. Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology, is called upon by the Vatican to assist them in their search of the four cardinals, because they have received a disturbing phone call, indicating that a secret and supposedly extinct group of scientists that refer to themselves as the Illuminati are responsible. Together with Vittoria Vettra from CERN and Captain Olivetti he tries to find the cardinals by following a path of illumination, that leads to four churches in Rome and eventually to the headquarters of the society. Meanwhile the Camarlengo, Cardinal Strauss and the commander of the Swiss Guard, Richter, are faced with the annihilation of the Vatican, as the vile with the antimatter has been hidden somewhere deep in the city and will go off at midnight. A race against time begins and more than ever loyalty and faith have to come together for a war that might end in the total defeat of the Catholic Church.While the movie version of 'The Da Vinci Code' followed the book very closely, Ron Howard made a number of changes to 'Angels and Demons', most of them for the better. He rewrote some of the characters and could therefore even cross out some of them completely, the most vital one being Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Characteristics and certain dialog scenes were also shifted, something that might confuse those who read the book recently, but for those who did a long time ago, it will hardly be important. Indeed, there are some bigger differences, but pretty much all of them improve the plot, and take out some major flaws of the book. The pacing of the movie is also better than its prequel, with a lot more action and less talking, which makes the 140 minutes go by very quickly.Tom Hanks, who once again plays the role of Robert Langdon, is more involved this time, doing a lot of running and always being in the center of things. That does him a lot of good, because he gets the chance to actually show some of his acting talents, and serve as more than just the person who has to tell the audience the historic trivia that the viewer needs to follow the plot. Kudos also to Ewan McGregor, who gives a very strong and emotional performance as the Camerlengo. He's very believable in his role and like Tom Hanks has a very strong presence on the screen. Ayelet Zurer on the other hand doesn't get very much to work with, and her best scene once again brings the typical church motive of women not being trustworthy to the top. Pierfrancesco Favino as Olivetti and Stellan Skarsgard as Richter both do a really good job, especially the later one as the grumpy leader of the Swiss Guard, who frequently complains about Langdon's old-fashioned and supposedly naive methods of finding the kidnapper of the cardinals. We also see Armin Mueller-Stahl as Cardinal Strauss, a relatively minor role, that he still manages to play great. Interestingly enough 'Angels and Demons' has less well-known cast than 'The Da Vinci Code' but at most times features better performances.Due to the controversial status of Dan Brown surrounding the Catholic Church, the Vatican denied the permission to film 'Angels and Demons' in the original churches in Rome. Anyway, the production designers did a terrific job recreating the interiors, with all the artwork and nostalgic charm you can only find in a place like that. Hans Zimmer's music is bombastic and powerful, making several scenes more exciting than they are anyway.It wouldn't be surprising if 'Angels and Demons' became just as much of a hit as 'The Da Vinci Code' which made $750 Million worldwide, despite negative reviews. The biggest flaws of the movie mostly come from the book already and if you enjoyed 'The Da Vinci Code' already there is no doubt you will also like 'Angels and Demons' which improved on its prequel without a doubt. It won't end up being a classic, but is still quite powerful, entertaining and a feast for the eyes. (3.5/5) A fast-paced, thrilling action flick, that does pretty much everything right 'The Da Vinci Code' didn't and manages to entertain for its total running time, which after all is more than two hours.",7,3,8,16 September 2009
Public Enemies," Nostalgic, well-acted gangster thriller, with some serious flaws in the pacing of the story though
","During the 1930s, which marked the infamous era of the Great Depression, a number of gangsters appeared on the scene and went on killing and robbing sprees throughout the United States. Among them were Bonnie & Clyde, who were immortalized through the 1967, but also Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, and John Dillinger. Now, the book 'Public Enemies', by Bryan Burrough, which I have indeed read, is about the careers of all of these criminals, and one can assume that the film would have been about six hours long, if all the material from the source would have been incorporated.Michael Mann, director of acclaimed crime thrillers such as 'Heat', and 'Collateral', decided to focus on the bank robber John Dillinger and his permanent cat and mouse game with the just recently established FBI. While several historic liberties were taken, the film creates a wonderfully nostalgic atmosphere in 1930s Chicago and other locations, and gives the audience an interesting perspective on the increasing crime spree during these days. Gangster thrillers are not exactly my favorite genre, but this film is a notable exception, as it is more the portrait of two extremely different men, one is the hunter, and one the pray, but both are outstanding in their wits and cunningness.It is the Great Depression, and several gangsters emerge over the United States and go on a crime spree as there has never been one before in the country. J. Edgar Hoover, the ambitious head of the newly established Federal Bureau of Investigation, asks for more government funding, but is denied and his capability as a leader is repeatedly questioned. One of his most outstanding men, Melvin Purvis, manages to kill one of the most notorious criminals of the time, Pretty Boy Floyd, and earns Hoover's recognition and is entrusted with the task of heading the Chicago field office. Meanwhile, John Dillinger breaks out several of his friends out of the Indiana State Prison, where one of his best men is shot and killed by a guard. After robbing another bank, Dillinger meets Billie Frechette, and she is immediately charmed by his passion and enthusiasm for freedom, even though he tells her quite quickly how he makes his living. Purvis quickly gets onto Dillinger, but during a stakeout at a hotel, Purvis realizes that it wasn't Dillinger hiding out there, but another gangster known as Baby Face Nelson. Quickly, a cat and mouse game ensues between the two, and it is only a matter of time before one of them kills the other.The mood of this film is extremely dark and the entire atmosphere is nostalgic, perfectly recreating the tone of the 1930s in the United States. Mann cut out several of the story lines found in the book and left out a number of criminals or reduces them to supporting players, like Pretty Boy Floyd and Baby Face Nelson. The entire film, which is just short of 2 1/2 hours, concentrates on the bank robber John Dillinger and his relationship with Billie Frechette, as well as his numerous escapes from the FBI. Even though the majority of the agents are portrayed as clueless amateurs, who make numerous mistakes that allow Dillinger and his gang to get away, the book points that out even clearer, and it's quite evident how much the Bureau has changed in the last 70 years. 'Public Enemies' is a very quiet film most of the time, that only uses music sparingly, and that heavily focuses on character development. Once in a while the dialogs are interrupted by short shootings, which more or less succeed in keeping my attention, but unfortunately they also made me realize how long and slow-paced the rest of the scenes really were the movie really could have been quite a bit shorter. It almost seems like the writers couldn't decide whether this film should be about Dillinger and his love interest, or Dillinger robbing banks and shooting up the Feds, and instead of going deep into one or the other, at times they don't really seem to get into either one of the two. The cutting and action scenes look almost a bit sloppy and amateurish at times, but for some reason it seems to fit with the mood of the film.One of the greatest parts about this film is without a doubt Johnny Depp, who cleverly avoids being stereo cast too much by occasionally playing dramatic roles instead of weird ones for his friend Tim Burton, and succeeds in bringing John Dillinger back to life. He brings an incredible personality to the character, without making him seem really likable, but instead playing him like he probably was in real life, cold and risk-taking. On the other side there's Christian Bale, adding another impressive performance to his resume, as FBI agent Melvin Purvis. Even though he stands on the good side of the law, he comes over as extremely cold and calculating, and there are very few scenes where he actually shows his warm and friendly side.. Marion Cotillard shows once again how much talent she has as Billie Frechette, Dillinger's naive, but eventually really tough girlfriend. Even though her acting is superb, I didn't find Dillinger's and Frechette's relationship too convincing and much too cold to have actually worked out. Maybe that is, because whenever they got really close, the scene was interrupted by another shooting. Those three dominate the plot and very few other actors manage to leave an impression, mainly because you can't keep up with the rapid introductions of new characters. Billy Crudup makes a convincing J. Edgar Hoover, but the character is really not explored too much, which also goes for Giovanni Ribisi and Channing Tatum.Michael Mann went down with 'Miami Vice', but with 'Public Enemies' he went straight back to the top again, and let's hope he'll stay there with the next round of ammo he'll deliver.",Null,0,0,22 July 2010
Dead Poets Society," Seize the Day- One of the Greatest Movies Ever!
","Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I'd be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.The movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or 'Oh Captain, my Captain', based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.There are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he's an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn't give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he's so embarrassed.Peter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie 'Master and Commander' shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.Some of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that 'he wanted to throw up at the end of the film'. I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won't put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!",10,90,95,17 November 2008
Crash," The 'City of Angels' is shown in a sad and painful light through 36 hours dominated by racism and prejudice.
","Sadness, hatred and bitterness can be found behind every corner in the so-called 'city of angels', racism dominates everyone's life in one way or the other and people yell and scream at each other simply because of their color and their language. Words are misinterpreted or misunderstood, which leads to conflicts and arguments, sometimes even fatal. This sad, but wonderful movie documents 36 hours in Los Angeles, with more or less average people finding themselves in unusual situations, and often colliding with each other in the most surprising ways. Whether you are a detective, a cop, a district attorney, a movie producer, a locksmith or a car thief, nobody is safe from being pulled into the Maelstrom of hatred and prejudice, which is ever present in L.A. The film is dramatically and intelligently intertwined, which will bring the audience to tears but at the same time is a piece of hope and optimism at the end.In Los Angeles, racism dominates the interaction between people and over the time of 36 hours many of them encounter it in closer ways than ever before. Detective Graham Waters is working on a case where a racist white cop shot a corrupt black one, and after finding $300,000 in cash in the black cop's car he is almost sure that the dead man was trafficking drugs. But the city, that wants to save face, wants to present the community with a fallen black hero instead of a drug dealer and persuades Waters to drop the case, in exchange for the clearance of his brother's criminal record. Jack Ryan is a racist cop, who after pulling over a couple that performed fellatio, sexually molests the wife under the eyes of her husband and his partner Tom Hanson. The movie director Cameron Thayer and his wife get in a huge fight after being pulled over by Ryan and Thayer's wife accuses him of being worried more about his reputation than her. Rick Cabot, the district attorney, and his wife Jean are attacked by two black thieves and their car is stolen. After that incident, Jean is in constant fear of people that are not of her race, and Rick tries to spin the incident to his advantage, no matter the cost. Daniel Ruiz, a Hispanic locksmith, gives his daughter a necklace, that is supposed to protect her from any danger, even bullets. After a communication problem with the Persian owner of a store, the store is robbed and trashed, and the insurance refuses to pay because of negligence. The owner is desperate and goes after Ruiz and causes a catastrophe to happen.This movie is a painful mosaic that spreads out over the city and involves numerous people of different ethnicity, languages and social classes. Just one small event, can cause a dangerous chain reaction that will end in casualties. Paul Haggis, in one of the best screenplays of the decade so far, ties up the plot strings convincingly and created a film with a powerful message. There are no good people in Los Angeles, no heroes and no saints, but some have their moments and most of them have their eyes opened by the end of this film. There is no true beginning or end, as it is just a glimpse into an average day for these people, one of many that is filled with sorrow and pain, but occasional happiness. The viewers are pulled in from the very first word on and won't be able to let go until the end credits start rolling. Some of the dialogs are even funny to a certain extent, because they are full of insults and swear words, but their content is so serious, that the smile just won't come in most cases. The language is extremely dirty and includes dozens of 'f-words' that is because the atmosphere in L.A. was supposed to be as authentic as possible, and it certainly is.Don Cheadle is very calm and moving as Graham Waters, a detective, who tries everything to get accepted by his mother, and in the end she is always more fond of his criminal younger brother than him. Matt Dillon just blew me away, beginning as the racist asshole, who sexually molests a young woman, to the hero, who risks his one life to pull someone from a burning car. Sandra Bullock as the racist wife of a district attorney has not a lot of screen time, but she is so perfectly unsympathetic that one has to congratulate her for a job well done. Michael Pena, playing the only truly good guy in this film, is extraordinary and some of his scenes will move anyone to tears, especially the one that is shown on the poster, of him letting out a tortured scream as he is holding his young daughter. Ryan Philippe proves that he can be considered one of the best young actors in Hollywood right now, giving a great dramatic performance as the young, naive police officer, who goes through an unfortunate transformation over the 36 hours the film takes place in. Terence Howard's character also changes considerably, from an ambitious, well-worded man, to the aggressive, foul-mouthed one at the end. Thandie Newton as the victim of Ryan's sexual molesting gives a sad and moving performance and her scenes with Dillon are among the best in the movie.Coincidences shape the lives of the multi-ethnical people in L.A., often for the worse as this movie shows. In any case, Paul Haggis crafted a masterpiece of story-telling that goes deep into the people that have to survive the daily life in a city, where racism is constantly present are where trust is a word nobody has ever heard of. Nobody can prevent the crashes and coincidences of life, but we can make the best of them,instead of blaming each other because of a different skin color or language.",10,3,6,21 July 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," A dark, but beautiful Fairy Tale about Innocence and War
","I read several reviews on Pan's Labyrinth, most of them very enthusiastic but warning about the violence and brutality. Now, I usually hate bloody and gory films, but I heard that this was a different kind of movie and I decided to watch it. I'm very impressed! Guillermo Del Toro really created a masterpiece with this movie about the innocence of a young child, who is thrown in the brutality of war, and even though I'm German, I think this should have won the Foreign Picture Oscar instead of The Lives of Others. The plot brilliantly weaves two stories together in one, obscuring reality and imagination until we forget which one is which. The young girl Ofelia and her pregnant mother arrive at the small military base of her stepfather Captain Vidal who is in charge of killing the rebells in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Vidal is a sadistic and dominant soldier, who is extremely strict with everyone and uses extreme brutality to get things done. Ofelia explores the surrounding area and discovers a labyrinth nearby, where she meets a faun, who tells her that she really is the daughter of a king, who can only return to her kingdom if she performs 3 dangerous tasks.It is true that there is very strong violence in this movie, but it is essential in this movie, because it shows that sad and horrible reality surrounding Ofelia and why she tries to escape it. The great and beautiful music, especially the theme, will give you goosebumps from time to time and as sad as the movie is, the message is that there are always wonderful things out there in the world, no matter how bad things may seem.Sergi Lopez does an excellent job as Captain Vidal. He perfectly shows his sadistic and frightening nature and even his eyes will send shivers down your back. Ivana Baquero as Ofelia also deserves high praise, because she manages to play the torn character of the young girl with such an emotion, that you will sometimes forget she's just acting. Same with Lopez by the way.All in all, you must have seen this movie which has won 3 Oscar, Best Art Direction, Cinematography and Make Up, and was the deserving winner of the Best Foreign Language Movie that year. But even though it can be described as a Fairy Tale, don't show it to your kids! It's really brutal and frightening at some points.",10,2,5,23 November 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A beautifully filmed epic that starts one of the greatest trilogies ever
","--This review includes some minor spoilers-- Many so-called film experts said the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien could never be made into a movie, because of the complex story and all the characters involved. People grew even more skeptic when Peter Jackson, who had only made a bunch of low-budget Horror movies, decided to give it a try. Therefore my expectations were quite low, when I went to the movies, especially since I wasn't a very big fan of the books. OK, they are quite well-written, but at some points they are just boring and too complicated to understand. Now when the movie ended and the credits started to role, I had tears in my eyes. It was one of those moments I was so glad to have been proved wrong. This movie is a masterpiece of fantasy, and back then I didn't know that the sequels would be even better.The dark lord Sauron created a powerful ring, that contained all his evil and with it he managed to conquer all of MiddleEarth. Isildur, king of Gondor, cut it off during a battle and even though he could have destroyed Sauron's evil forever, he decided to keep it and use it against his enemies. The ring betrayed Isildur and led to his death, disappearing in a river, lying there for 2500 years. Then it was found by the creature Gollum, who took it into the mountains, where he was consumed by it, eventually splitting his personality and driving him completely insane. The ring, which can prolong life, left Gollum after 500 years and was then found by the hobbit Bilbo. Hobbits, small creatures who prefer life when its comfortable, usually don't get involved in adventures. Usually.Because at Bilbo's 111th birthday, the wizard Gandalf shows up and after Bilbo demonstrates the rings power at his birthday party realizes that he is in possession of Sauron's ring. Realizing that Sauron already send the Nazgul, dark riders, who can feel the ring's presence after Frodo, he urges him to leave his hometown. Frodo, who is accompanied his friend Sam, and the troublemakers Merry and Pippin, finally makes it to Bruchtal, a city of Elves, where the council decides that the ring has to be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, which requires a long and dangerous journey. There Frodo decides to take to journey and Sam, Merry, Pippin come with him once again. Gandalf, the strider Aragorn, the elf Legolas, the dwarf Gimli, and the man Boromir, also pledge to aid Frodo and they all become the Fellowship of the Ring. That is pretty much the first half of the film, the second half depicting the Fellowship's journey over the mountains, the mines of Moria and the Elven Forrest.The first film in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy brilliantly introduces us to the main characters who are all greatly cast. Especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf (Oscar Nominated), Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn (very emotional), John Rhys-Davies as Gimli (very funny), Sean Bean as Boromir and of course Elijah Wood as Frodo. The film was filmed in New Zealand, and the spectacular Cinematography makes me look forward to the Blu-Ray release of the film. Also the music, by Howard Shore is one of the greatest ever composed for a movie. The Visual Effects are also brilliant, and you will have a hard time telling what is GCI and what not.All in all, there is really nothing negative you can say about this movie. As I stated before you don't have to like the books to become a fan of the movies and if you buy Fellowship of the Rings on DVD, I really recommend the Extended Version. It really adds a lot to the story and the backgrounds of several characters.",10,1,1,29 November 2008
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," In an ambitious, philosophical tale, Brad Pitt experiences life aging backwards!
","Based on a popular short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, the film tells the story of a man, who is born old and ages backwards, struggling to find a place in a society, which is afraid of the unusual and the unknown. Being Fincher's most expensive project to date, with a budget of $160 Million, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is somewhat of a fairy tale and a historic epic, that takes place in the 20th century, and in the end, has a bit too much ambition for its own good.On the night the Great War finally ends, Benjamin Button is born in New Orleans, under 'unusual circumstances'. Thomas Button is confronted with the exact meaning of these words, when he finds out that his wife died in childbirth and that his child looks like the miniature version of an old man on his death bed. Desperate, he takes the child from his home and drops it on the stairs of a nursery home, where two young employees find it and decide to adopt it, despite its physical abnormalities. Although they expect the child, named Benjamin, to die soon, he starts to grow and to everyone's astonishment younger. After a couple of years, he meets Daisy, a curious girl, who immediately feels a certain affection for Benjamin although they couldn't be more different in their looks. Growing up in the nursery home, Benjamin frequently encounters death, as its takes one after another guest of the home, and eventually he decides to leave and go to sea on the tugboat of Captain Mike. Initially reluctant to take the old man on board, Mike is soon surprised by Benjamin's strong will and youthful spirit, and him and his crew travel all around the world eventually ending up in Russia. There Benjamin meets Elizabeth Abbot, who vegetates in an unhappy marriage and starts an affair with Benjamin, who eventually realizes that his true love, Daisy, is far home where he should be. But he questions himself whether a relationship is even possible, when two people age in different direction, and while one of them grows older the other one gets younger.Watching this film like going through the photo album of a stranger, who evidently had a fascinating life, but we only get glimpses into it without any explanations of what lead to the situations. The film feels like a set of pictures, that was failed to put together properly to create a compact narrative. For the first hour, by far my favorite part of this film, from his early days in New Orleans to his career on the tugboat, I was really interested in the storyline and the strange character of Benjamin. But, as soon as he comes home from the war, the story begins to fall apart, and makes several jumps from one time period to another, without ever really going into them. New Orleans looks wonderfully nostalgic though and the scenes convey a unique atmosphere that make out the magic of this film. What it lacks in story development, the film makes up with an unreachable timelessness. Being filled with motifs of death, war, and loss, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is a highly melancholy film that has few happy moments and therefore becomes more of a historic drama, than a fantasy epic. It's highly philosophical, with Benjamin Button narrating quite a bit of the plot, and inserting his unique views on the world and its people.As I mentioned previously, the inspiration for the movie was a 32 page short story. So, with the running time of the film just falling short of three hours, I felt that the plot was stretched out too far, and all in all the film is about 30 minutes too long. It's sad, because the story is really one of importance, and it would be a shame for it to get lost to some of the viewers. It's a complex movie, and one that requires a clear mind and attention. Some of the little things in the film really stood out for me, like the introduction story of the blind man, who creates a clock in memory of his fallen son, a shocking and unexpected hook to the story. But, while the film has some humorous elements, like an old man, who had some trouble during his life going out during thunderstorms, it is mostly very depressing, quiet and sad. While comparisons to the films 'Forrest Gump', and especially 'Big Fish' are almost bound to happen, 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' doesn't quite have the passion and the energy of the other two films.Benjamin Button is played by Brad Pitt, who more than deserved his Oscar nomination for a role that is unusually quiet and philosophical for him. While by no means a bad actor in his other projects, he usually tends to be a bit of the winking 'funny guy', rather than the introverted outsider. His performance is striking, yet subtle, and it's especially his expressions and the tone of his voice that make his character so intriguing. Cate Blanchett adds another stunning performance to her long resumee of top-notch character performances. While not quite as mesmerizing as Pitt, she has this captivating aura, that makes her an intense presence on screen. Taraji P. Henson is excellent and proves her undeniable talent for dramatic roles. Tilda Swinton plays Benjamin's first true love in the cold Russia, and while her role is almost a cameo, her chemistry with Pitt is astounding.The film has a lot going for itself, including the acting, the effects, the nostalgic settings, and the philosophical message that balanced some of the saddest themes of life so well, that it really made me think for many days. But in the end, I keep thinking back to the metaphorical photo album I described earlier and I just have to say the movie is not the masterpiece it should have been.",7,0,1,20 July 2010
The Dark Knight," Batman is back, better than ever
","'This review includes a few minor spoilers' I have to admit that I started to loose faith in comic adaptations, recently. After Spider-Man 3 and the slightly better Superman Returns, I kinda lost interest in those two heroes and I began to focus my attention on Batman. Batman is a very interesting person, since his alter ego Bruce Wayne is pretty well known person, a billionaire, who has developed a dark side over the years, mainly due to the murder of his parents.When I saw Batman and Robin many years ago, I thought that this was the end of Batman. The whole movie was just terribly weak and even the strong cast couldn't carry the movie, making Batman and Robin a very dark spot in the Batman franchise. I suggest you watch it though, because it will make you appreciate Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.Batman Begins strongly rebooted the series. The Direction, the cast, the story; everything just fit together perfectly and it make me look forward to a sequel.Now, I read many of the reviews and they were all very enthusiastic. I was surprised, because I expected to see a great movie, but not a movie that would even make Roger Ebert give it a 4/4. But now, after having seen the movie, I'm totally speechless. This is definitely one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie of the decade.The acting really made out a huge part of this movies greatness. Christian Bale portrays Wayne in an excellent way, making you feel his pain and anger and shows more than ever that he was the best choice for the role. Aaaron Eckart was great too, playing Harvey Dent and Two-Face very convincing. I haven't seen too many of his movies yet, definitely a mistake. He can play the good, almost flawless Harvey Dent and at the same time completely get into the role of an evil person, consumed by anger and revenge. His situation is not even that different from Batman's, but he chooses the wrong way of dealing with it. In fact, all of the actors showed a great performance: Maggie Gyllenhall (who tries to forget her love for Bruce), Michael Cane (whose performances are rarely below great), Morgan Freeman (same as Michael Cane) and Gary Oldman (who seems to get better and better with the movies he makes.And then of course, Heath Ledger, whose performance redefines the term pure awesomeness. There is no one, absolutely no one (including Jack Nicholson) who could have done a better job with this role. He manages to show the Joker as a terribly evil and heartless monster but at the same time also manages to gain the most laughs of the audience, with his appearance, voice and dialogue. It shows what a great actor Heath Ledger really was and this is by far his best performance (sorry, Brokeback Mountain fans). He plays his role completely flawless and more than deserves an Oscar for his performance, a performance that will be hard to top in years to come. It's sad that he won't have a chance to continue his career, which began so promising and ended way too early.But it's not only the actors that make this movie so good. Christopher Nolan already did an excellent job with Batman Begins but The Dark Knight tops Batman Begins in every aspect, including the script. There is not a single thing that could have been solved better and there were many psychological surprises and twists, no one would have expected.It's too bad I don't have an IMAX theatre close to me, because the visual effects and action were already great in a normal Cinema. In an Imax theatre, they must be spectacular.In conclusion I have to say, that this movie regenerated my faith in comic adaptations. It was a long time ago that a movie surprised me like Dark Knight, and many years will pass until it happens again. Until then, this movie stands on top of my long list of movie favorites. Long live the Batman!!!",10,3,7,22 July 2008
Inception," DiCaprio & Co. manipulate dreams in a visionary, futuristic crime thriller!
","'Inception' is just brilliant. An unusual premise combined with intelligent story-telling and original writing, resulted in a fantastic science-fiction thriller with both a dramatic love story and an action-packed heist. Dreams have never been explored, defined and created in such an original way before in a film, and in a summer full of sequels and remakes, it's great to finally see a movie with brand-new and thought provoking material that is without a doubt one of the best pictures of the year so far.Cobb is an extractor and when somebody is dreaming, he and his team will be able to access the subject's mind, find their way around it and then retrieve a specific piece of information. Together with his assistant Arthur and his architect Nash, he is working to retrieve something from the dream of Saito at the beginning of the film, but their mission fails when Saito discovers a flaw in the design of the dream and realizes that he is asleep. Cobb and Arthur are trying to escape from Japan, but Saito catches them and offers them a job, requiring them to perform the act of inception, planting an idea in somebody's mind instead of merely retrieving it. Although Arthur is strictly against it, Cobb reluctantly agrees, mainly because Saito offers him an opportunity to see his children again, who are cut off from their father in the United States. Cobb makes his way to Paris to assemble a new team for this mission, but as it turns out it maybe more difficult than anticipated to make it out alive of this mission.No synopsis could ever do justice to the complex plot of this film, and the story depends on so many little factors that you simply have to see the film to completely understand it. 'Inception' is complicated, yes, but if you can keep your brain sharp for the entire 2 1/2 hours, you are almost guaranteed to leave the movie theatre immensely satisfied with what you have just witnessed. The film may be complex, but at no point in this movie I was confused, and that says a lot about the way this film tries to explain its premise to the audience. You can try to compare this film with others, such as 'The Matrix', but ultimately it's in a category all by itself, and could best be defined as a futuristic crime-thriller. Of course, the entire concept of accessing and manipulating dreams has to be explained to the baffled audience at first, before the big coup of planting an idea can take place, a part mostly filled out by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He has to fill in Ellen Paige's character Ariadne, and his explanations sounded so scientific, that I had no trouble believing that such a deed could be possible.The film also succeeds, because it cleverly balances an emotional love story, with numerous scenes of action, but still hardly ever slows down. Not a single moment seems to be wasted in this film, and I was captivated by the slowly untangling history between DiCaprio's character and his wife that was very reminiscent of a big puzzle, with small pieces being added throughout the film, but the complete picture only offered itself to the viewers at the end. Christopher Nolan truly shows his ability as a director through the perfectly choreographed action scenes, and the film already opens in high gears, with a great shooting scene. Once again, there is a lot happening in the first 15 minutes, and for a while you won't realize what is going on, but the art of this film is that everything seems to make sense sooner or later. There are several more chase scenes and even more shootings, but without a doubt the best action scene in this film, quite possibly one of the best ones ever shot for a film, involves Joseph Gordon-Levitt fighting off two thugs in the corridor of a hotel room with shifting and eventually no gravity at all.I still can't believe that the young guy from 'Titanic', turned out to be such a great actor, and even makes a convincing hero in an action film. Leonardo DiCaprio, against all odds, became a real badass in his film projects, and 'Inception' is bound to give him his fourth Oscar nomination, and possibly his first win. He is fantastic, both as the leader of the team trying to plant the idea, and the tortured husband, who is haunted by the demons of his wife's death. There will definitely be several discussions about which actors with gather an Oscar nomination, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is certainly a good candidate, if only for the beautiful action sequence without gravity. There is not much revealed about his character, but he has great charisma, and is really the only one who brings a few humorous moments into this film. Marion Cotillard, who is in high demand since 'La Vie en Rose' three years ago, is at her very best as Cobb's deceased wife, who still haunts him in his dreams. The rest of Cobb's team consists of Ellen Page as Adriane, who does a great job, especially in her interactions with DiCaprio, Tom Hardy as the cynical Forgerer Eames, and Dileep Rao as the Chemist Yusuf. Ken Watanabe, who has a great authoritative presence, plays Saito, who seems to be a villain, but eventually turns out to be an honorable businessman, and Cillian Murphy plays the man who is supposed to have the idea planted in his head, who will inherit his father's entire business, despite him being disappointed with his son.Inception is a movie highlight of the year 2010, and through its fresh concept will certainly be a candidate for the big trophy at next year's Oscars. Now, I just hope that nobody will attempt to make a sequel of this film and that Christopher Nolan will put just as much creativity into his next film, the third 'Batman' movie.",10,5,10,19 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," A modern take on the most brilliant literary detective ever, with a fantastic Downey, Jr.!
","Published by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, sometime around the turn of the 20th century, the 'Sherlock Holmes' stories have become classics of British literature, and have been turned into movies or TV Series dozens of times. But then, when you think you have seen it all, seen him solve every possible murder involving every possible scenario (my favorite still being 'The Speckled Band' about a psychopathic ex-doctor and convicted murderer, who plans to kill his stepdaughters using a poisonous snake), Guy Ritchie comes along and makes a film with the incredibly original and creative title 'Sherlock Holmes'.Now, the highly conservative Holmes fans will probably give this film ten minutes before they throw the remote control at the TV, but those who have never read the stories will most likely appreciate Ritchie's take on the material. From the highly intelligent, charismatic, professional, and dry character in the books, Holmes turns into a crazy, obnoxious and cynical figure, who enjoys fighting and gambling in the boxing ring and even has a love relationship, something unthinkable for the original. Rather than a classic detective story, this is a modern, action film with plenty of chases and explosions, set to the background of 1890s London and except for the basic outline, doesn't have anything in common with the literary style of Conan Doyle's works.Lord Blackwood, a necromancer and practionist of black magic, is caught in the act of performing a deadly ritual on a young woman by Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson and sentenced to death by hanging. Initially, this was also the last case Holmes and Watson were to be working together, before the latter moved out their office and home at Baker Street 221B, and moved together with his girlfriend Mary. Holmes, not too fond of the idea of loosing his partner and best friend, tries to spoil Watson's relationship by any means possible, but he soon realizes that Watson is serious and fears that their long working relationship is over. But then, Lord Blackwood mysteriously vanishes from his grave and is seen wandering around London, murdering the leading members of one of London's secret societies, the Temple of the Four Orders. Watson, who provided the death certificate at Blackwood's execution, is convinced by Holmes to help him close this case, since not only the safety of London is in danger but also Watson's reputation. But soon they discover that there is much more to it, when Irene Adler, a former lover of Holmes shows up in London, but can Holmes still trust her, especially since she doesn't even bother hiding her profession of a thief from him? Whether you like the modern approach to Sherlock Holmes is of very little importance when looking at the stunning sets that have been build up for this film. London looks fascinating, perfectly creating a nostalgic atmosphere and a creepy feeling in its narrow alleys. Then there are famous landmarks,like the half-finished Tower Bridge, or the Docks, which make the entire scenery even more realistic and it's amazing how easy it has become today to age even a city by 100 years without there being a single glitch in the visuals. 'Sherlock Holmes' is wonderfully constructed as an action movie, with not excessively overused action scenes, but some greatly choreographed fights. There is a moment,relatively early in this movie, when Holmes is in the boxing ring with an opponent and the smug detective analyzes and predicts every single movement he needs to make against that rock of a guy to beat him,something shown in slow motion attacks. Many of the typical Holmes clichés are woven into the story just like that, and most of the time it's just incredibly funny how many references to the Conan Doyle stories are included, but yet this film never becomes a complete parody of the character. Hans Zimmer composed a great score, which has a wonderful old, but energetic feel to it, and was among this year's Oscar nominees for Original Score. The one thing that really bugged me about this so-called 'popcorn flick' was how much stuff was thrown into the plot regarding the case, and when Holmes eventually starts to reveal the entire mystery towards the end, I had somewhat lost count of which chemicals were used and how exactly everyone met their demise.Robert Downey, Jr. single-handedly brings the character of Sherlock Holmes back to life, and does it in such a funny, fresh, and crazy way, that he proves once more that he could probably play a brick wall and still receive praise for it. This guy really succeeds in all of his roles, and not only does he have the right charisma and believable ingenuity to play the detective, but he's just so damn sympathetic. Dr. Watson is played by Jude Law, who sadly enjoys a very unfair reputation concerning his looks being better than his acting talent has great chemistry with Holmes and makes a rather convincing doctor and, once again different than in the books, is more than capable of taking out guys with a bigger biceps and Pecs than he has. Rachel McAdams looks cute, certainly, but her chances to act are very limited and most of the time her job is either to look hot or seduce Holmes, making their relationship rather dry, shallow and sparkless, while Mark Strong, whom I already liked in 'Body of Lies' gives a menacing and creepy performance as Lord Blackwood.'Sherlock Holmes' deserves compliments for its freshness and originality in bringing an old-fashioned literary character back to screen. Conan Doyle would probably role over in his grace if he knew this film existed, but those who really want to see an exciting, fast-paced and somewhat unusual flick, should definitely not miss this one.",8,1,2,20 July 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Enjoyable for kids and adults, but the concept starts to become old
","--Some minor spoilers, skip the part that describes the plot if you don't want to know anything about it--Personally, I didn't like the second 'Ice Age' movie that much. I thought it just wasn't original enough, and couldn't make an impact compared to the great original. So, since movies franchises often have the tendency to get worse with each sequel, I wasn't expecting very much of the third Ice Age movie 'Dawn of the Dinosaurs'. But, I have to admit, it was quite entertaining and funny, with many jokes and funny situations. The change of location from the white ice world, the main characters inhabited in the first two films, to the lush and green jungle, also did the movie some good, because the optic is just different and more exciting. While the first Ice Age movie still remains unreached by either of the sequels, the third one considerably improves on the second one, with more humor, better action and interesting ideas.        Manfred and Ellie, the two mammoths, are expecting a baby, and Manfred, who is really happy to become a father tries everything to make his wife more comfortable and happy. Meanwhile, the saber-toothed tiger Diego, has to deal with the fact, that he is not the youngest anymore, and that his instincts and reflexes are getting worse. He decides to leave his herd, because he feels his life is coming to an end. Sid, the sloth, wants to have children of his own, and when he discovers three abandoned eggs in a cave, he decides to take them with him. One morning, he realizes that three dinosaurs have hatched from the eggs, and to make matters worse their mother is already looking for them. She attacks Sid and her three babies and abducts them to her world, a large, lush and green jungle, that is located directly under the thick layer of ice. Manfred, Ellie, the two opossums Crash and Eddie, decide to save Sid and eventually meet up with Diego on the way again. They are then joined by the mad wannabe pirate Buck, a weasel, who lost his eye to a gigantic monster, named Rudy, that lives somewhere deep in the jungle. Sid, meanwhile, tries to convince the dinosaurs' mother, that he can provide more for the children than her, but eventually has to accept that children belong to their real mother. The squirrel Scrat, once again reunited with his precious nut, has to deal with an entirely new problem. A femme fatal squirrel, who uses her charm to take Scrat's nut away from him. Being a lot smarter and trickier than him, she gets to keep the nut for most of the time, but eventually falls in love with Scrat, after he saves her from deadly lava. But what is more important to Scrat, his nut or his new girlfriend?With so many animated movies flooding the market these days, it becomes quite hard to come up with new ideas. Talking animals certainly isn't one, but if the characters have enough history and emotion, it really doesn't matter. 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' really profits from a slightly new approach to the material, which includes some very obvious parodies. The new character of Buck was most definitely inspired by Jack Sparrow from 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and the final battle could have directly come from one of the 'Star Wars' movies. Then we have the dinosaurs, who are, of course, extremely evil and always hunt down the main characters. All in all, the movies appears slightly stretched and has some relatively slow bits, for which the beginning and ending compensate, though. Especially the first 20-25 minutes, are some of the funniest in any Ice Age movie. And the scenes involving Scrat and his new girlfriend are just as funny as they have always been.Then we have once again, the actors who give the characters their voices. Ray Romano, who has such a unique voice, speaks Manfred, Denis Leary is Diego, John Leguizamo is Sid and Queen Latifah is Ellie. Buck, the pirate, is voiced by British actor Simon Pegg. Animated movies can never be judged according to acting, because the true leading actors here are the animators. But just as we are used to, the previously mentioned actors put their best effort into providing their character's voice.So, Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs is entertaining and enjoyable, but certainly not the best animated movie of the year. Still it is a good 90 minute time filler, and those who enjoyed the previous Ice Age films, will definitely also like this one. (3.5/5)The third installment in the Ice Age movie franchise is funny and entertaining, with some very original ideas, but certain lengths throughout the entire film.",7,14,18,16 September 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The final journey of the boy who lived brings the greatest film franchise of this generation to a spectacular close!
","Harry Potter, a series of novels that defied everything that was possible and started a phenomenon unlike anything that ever existed or ever will exist. An entire generation has come to identify themselves with the books and the movies, especially those who shared a similar age with the characters when they came out. Last night, when I saw the eighth and final Harry Potter movie at the midnight screening, I was yelling and cheering when the curtain came open and once again yelling and cheering when the credits started to roll. But I had tears in my eyes, both of joy and immense sadness that it was now over, as one of the greatest film series of all time comes to an end.After having destroyed their first Horcrux and having buried Dobby, Harry, Ron and Hermione are hiding at shell cottage with Ron's oldest brother Bill, his wife Fleur, as well as the goblin Griphook and the wand maker Mr. Olivander. Griphook tells Harry that the sword of Gryffindor in his possession was supposed to be in the Gringotts vault of Bellatrix Lestrange and the three eventually start to suspect that a Horcrux might be hidden there. After successfully breaking in and barely escaping on the back of a dragon, the three realize that the last stop in their journey will have to be Hogwarts, the school they went to for six years, and where the final showdown between Harry Potter and his nemesis Lord Voldemort will take place. Neither can live, while the other one survives.As far as I'm concerned the right adjectives to describe this film haven't been invented yet. No words I can think of would do the grandness and perfection of the spectacular conclusion of this film franchise justice, and for now I'll just have to leave it at saying that this has good chances of becoming my favorite movie of the year. When you sit there and watch the movie at midnight with a group of teenagers all nearing the age of 20, who define their childhood with 'Harry Potter' you are swept right into a different world of enthusiasm, emotions and nostalgia. I didn't think it was just great, I thought it was flawless. The sad and emotional scenes are so heart-wrenching that I could hear the entire movie theater tearing up, mainly during the scenes involving Snape and his memories that Harry watches in Dumbledore's Pensieve. Snape really comes to define this movie and his character really got to me as a man, who seemed to be the epitome of coldness and villainy throughout the entire series, and in the end turns out to be a tragic hero of the greatest measure, who would even have made Shakespeare proud. The movie is a huge extravaganza of action and visual spectacles, and while the first part was really solemn, apocalyptic and quiet, this one almost indulges in its grand scales and procures a huge battle of magic and some very powerful spells, bringing rock statues to live and creating an enormous energy shield around the castle. I always said that I wanted the series to go out with a bang and in the most memorable way possible and David Yates ensured with his vision that this film will be remembered for years to come.The acting in Harry Potter has never been as good as it is here. Daniel Radcliffe in his final performance as the hero of this great franchise takes absolute center stage here and after ten years in the role he makes an incredibly convincing, brave and courageous hero, who conveys emotions with credibility and there are some scenes, where his facial expressions are just heartbreaking. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are really just supporting players here, but they have both made quite a name for themselves in their roles as well and all three actors are capable of continuing their careers far beyond Harry Potter. However, I think the key to the film's immense success are the performances by Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman, both of whom are more than deserving of an Oscar nomination. Fiennes, who is one of my favorite actors working today, finally hits the mark completely as Lord Voldemort and he is so menacing, cold and scary in his role that he has now become the living embodiment of evil and the defining villain of a generation. Alan Rickman though has a personality unmatched by any actor I have ever seen before. Snape is someone you love to hate and hate to love at the same time. Rickman's facial expressions as Snape are incredible subtle, but just the slightest change can reveal so much about him, and his carefully chosen enunciation of each syllable he utters is beyond belief. Although he is scary and seems cold-hearted most of the time, in the end when all comes to a close, everyone will feel so sorry for him. Finally though I have to give a shout out to Matthew Lewis who played Neville Longbottom, and after starting off as a chubby and not too bright lad in 'The Philosopher's Stone', he's become a rough, determined and courageous fighter who believes in freedom and defending yourself. I was really impressed with his transformation.For the first time in eight movies, I honestly believed that the screen version worked better than the written version. The pictures just seemed to tell the story so much better, and while some of the book almost felt like a letdown to me, the film finished it all off on such a brilliant and high note and the final image was heart-warming and really felt conclusive, and that's when I knew that it was all over. This franchise will never quite finds its equal, as it has moved and influenced so many people who now come off age. It's always sad to say goodbye, but long live Harry Potter, the boy who lived!",Null,0,2,15 July 2011
