The New World," most beautiful film i've ever seen
","Saw it yesterday in the cinema. How can one possibly write a review on a work of art like this?! I will try anyway - It just blew me away. I'd read all the reviews that it was boring etc, but it held me completely from start to finish. The film somehow returned me to a childhood-like state of innocence and wonder...it made me cry at the beauty of life. And not many films can make me cry. As I was falling asleep in bed with my girlfriend late last night the images Malick painted on screen were still flashing across my mind. The film is like a dream in many ways. Colin Farrell did a wonderful job and he can say so much with his eyes and Miss Kilcher is a revelation for sure. But Malick of course is the real star here. And I thought THE THIN RED LINE was perfect, but this is a whole other level.",10,3,7,9 May 2006
