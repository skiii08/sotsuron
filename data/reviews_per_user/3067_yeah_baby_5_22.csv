Catch Me If You Can," Smart flick.
","I could not believe that this movie was a true story. Frank W. Abignale (Leonardo DiCaprio) was a smart kid. This movie was pretty funny too, I mean some of the ways Abignale tries to hide himself. Tom Hanks plays a good role as Carl Hanratty as well. It is weird hearing him with an accent, especially that kind. I enjoyed it though, I give it 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,14 January 2004
Fight Club," A Knockout
","I watch this film mostly for the humour, but the story is good too. It's a thinker though. Make sure your head is clear when you watch it. Brad Pitt's character of Tyler is flashed four times before Edward Norton's character of Rupert talks to him. I give this movie 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,9 January 2004
Inglourious Basterds," One of the best movies of the year
","Inglourious Basterds is not your typical Tarantino flick. Normally Tarantino does films that are gangster and heist related or sometimes both. With Inglourious Basterds Tarantino takes a different approach using the Second World War as a setting. However, similar to his other films, there are cases where the violence is expressed in a exaggerated and sometimes comedic manner. However, the beginning of the film does express the seriousness of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany and the Second World War in general. Then there is Brad Pitt's character Aldo Raine who adds a bit of comic relief to the film with certain one liners and ridiculous phrases. However, the best performance was by Christoph Waltz who plays Col. Hans Landa. Waltz's performance of Landa was very well done and should not be overlooked when it comes time to pick Oscar nominations in January. There are certain goofs in Inglourious Basterds that are noticeable for example using French in English subtitles however, even masterpieces for example The Godfather contained a number of goofs as well. Inglourious Basterds in my opinion is one of the best movies of 2009 so far. If I was a member of the Academy, I would nominate Inglourious Basterds in six categories.Best Picture, Best Director-Quentin Tarantino, Actor in a Supporting Role-Christoph Waltz, Writing, material written directly for the screen, Art Direction and Costume DesignI am hoping the Academy considers these categories in 2010. In a nutshell I believe Inglourious Basterds is a masterpiece and any fans of war movies and Tarantino flicks should definitely check this out. 10/10",10,4,13,21 August 2009
Public Enemies," Very good. Oscar worthy.
","In my opinion, Public Enemies is the best movie of 2009 so far. Johnny Depp's portrayal of John Dillinger was very well done and the film is definitely Oscar worthy. I did not know too much about John Dillinger until I saw this movie but when I did it cleared up a lot of questions I needed answered. I found Public Enemies to be a 1930s version of Heat and another version of the movie Road to Perdition. Aside from the storyline, I will be surprised if the film does not win or is not nominated for an Academy Award for Sound. The sound of the machine gun fire and gunfire in general was very well done and deserves an award or several awards in 2010. SPOILER: Even though I did not know much about Dillinger until seeing Public Enemies, I found the death scene at the end to be dead on from what I read about him. However, certain flaws I found in Public Enemies were that certain characters were killed after Dillinger in real life while they were killed before him in the movie.Aside from the flaws, I believe Michael Mann did an excellent job on Public Enemies and I believe it should be nominated for Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, Directing and Picture at the Oscars in 2010.10/10",10,5,13,17 July 2009
The Girl Next Door," Different but really good.
","The Girl Next Door was an excellent movie and not only because Elisha Cuthbert looked really good in it, it was funny and reminded me a little of American Pie. To avoid spoilers please disregard the next paragraph.************************************************************************
The funniest part of the movie in my opinion is the part where Eli is trying to persuade Matthew to take Danielle to a hotel to do 'you know what' and how he is literally begging Matthew to do it. But my favorite part is where Matthew is caught spying on Danielle while changing, hee hee.
************************************************************************
There are not very many movies that I see in theatres that make me want to buy it on DVD. Even after a week of seeing the movie I am still thinking about it. If I could give higher than 10 I would but since I can not The Girl Next Door receives 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,13 May 2004
Malcolm X," Once you see it, you will understand.
","This is an excellent movie. The plot is great and it makes people realize what life was like for Malcolm Turner or 'Malcolm X' during the time where racism was high in society. I looked at pictures of the real Malcolm X and Denzel Washington fits the character very well. The film may be long but it needs to be watched closely in order to know the real life story of Malcolm X. To avoid spoilers, disregard the next paragraph.
This movie describes the life of Malcolm X from his childhood, his life or crime, prison, his release, his rise to fame and up to the threats he received and his assassination.I recommend this movie for anyone who is interested in historical figures but even you are not you may still find it entertaining. I loved it and give it 10 out of 10.",10,2,8,2 March 2004
Forrest Gump," Life is like a box of chocolates......
","This is a good film for Tom Hanks. He plays a good role as Forrest. I never read the book but I liked the movie though. It was funny, especially the part where he drinks fifteen Dr. Peppers and has to go to the washroom while meeting John F. Kennedy. I liked it though, it wasn't Tom Hanks best films but it was still good.",8,0,3,9 January 2004
LÃ©on: The Professional," Excellent action movie
",I love gangster film. Especially ones with tons of action in them. It was different seeing Natalie Portman in a movie like this but she did well in it. I also like the character of Leon played by Jean Reno. It was funny when Matilda asked him what he did for a living and he said I am a cleaner. Great movie.,10,3,6,9 January 2004
Cast Away," Great story
","This is one of my favorite movies. There is such a good story for it and Tom Hanks does a great job in this film. Tom Hanks was nominated for best actor for this movie but lost it to Russell Crowe. Tom Hanks should have got it though. I really like how Tom Hanks grew all of the hair for his character himself instead of wearing a fake beard and wig. I especially like Wilson too, that was a good idea. I definetely give Cast Away 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,14 January 2004
American Beauty," Look really close
",This is a masterpiece. It is funny and has a good story. Some people look at the character of Lester as a guy whose life continues to get worse. I look at his character as someone who has had a bad life and is out to have a good life. I recommend this film to everyone. I give it 10 out of 10.,10,0,1,9 January 2004
The Love Guru," Make your own decision
","I don't understand why everyone thinks this movie is bad. I didn't think it was as funny as Austin Powers but since Mike Myers played the Austin Powers role well and that all three movies were such big hits, I think that everyone believes that Mike Myers has to reach that level with every movie he makes. The Love Guru however is somewhat of a different approach in Myers career. The movie is not only about a Guru and the Toronto Maple Leafs, it also has a bit of a romantic storyline from two points of view but I won't ruin it if you intend on seeing it. Verne Troyer also adds to the humour with a number of hilarious acts he performs in the movie. I also found it interesting that Mike Myers was able to use the LA Kings, Toronto Maple Leafs and Hockey Night in Canada in the film. That was one aspect I found to allow like the film even more since I watch hockey on CBC. This film is also viewed as controversial due to the humorous aspects of the Guru. Films like Borat and Passion of the Christ are viewed as controversial and are some of the best films of all time so to give the Love Guru negative reviews due to the controversy involved does not really make sense. The Love Guru has a great storyline and even though it may be a bit far fetched at times, make your own decision and don't just listen to the reviews and the critics.10/10",10,7,16,10 July 2008
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best war films of all time.
","This is definetely one of my top ten. It includes a great cast, great action and a great story. I never really knew much about the second world war until I saw this movie. After I saw this movie, I became more interested in history. After watching this movie a couple of times, I became more familiar with the second world war and how bad it really was. This is an excellent movie. I give it 10 out of 10.",10,4,7,9 January 2004
Revolutionary Road," Very good and teaches us a little something
","I enjoy films that have a hidden lesson. American Beauty had one and so does Sam Mendes' new film Revolutionary Road. This is a very different type of film starring the two main cast members of Titanic. However, this is not a film about Jack and Rose from Titanic and if anything is the complete opposite type of storyline compared to Titanic. The film has a similar type of storyline to American Beauty, only this time it occurs in the 1950s. Based on history classes I have taken in the past, Revolutionary Road's portrayal of life in the 1950s is almost a dead-on match from what I learned. There is the stay at home mother with the working father, where the father is in charge of the household and everyone in it. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as Frank Wheeler was interesting and most certainly takes a different approach compared to other films he has done. Kate Winslet's portrayal of April was excellent was definitely worthy of the Golden Globe she received. Michael Shannon's acting was terrific and there is definitely some competition for the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. As a male this is not normally the type of movie I would see since I generally watch action films and comedies, however any male can learn a lesson from Revolutionary Road when the film is over. Also if you enjoy films by Sam Mendes you will not be disappointed.10/10",10,4,8,8 February 2009
Dumb and Dumber," Easily the funniest movie of all time
","I think that this is the funniest movie of all time. Every minute there is a joke in this film. This is the movie that made Jim Carrey what he is today. The jokes are so funny though. If you are having a bad day or if you are feeling upset, I recommend this movie. I rate it 10 out of 10.",10,0,3,10 January 2004
Pulp Fiction," One of my top ten.
","This was a great film. It was funny, had action and a few twists involved. In particular, I like the character of Butch since he was one of the good guys of the film but Jules, Vincent and Marcellus were good too. I also like the way the film was arranged as well. It makes you think of what would come first and what would come last. I give Pulp Fiction 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,9 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The best of the new three
","Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith was an excellent movie, a large number of question that I was wondering for years were finally answered with this movie. This film does take a different approach than the other Star Wars films. For one thing, given the fact that it received a PG-13 rating compared to the other films where they were rated PG, Revenge of the Sth has a darker approach to the plot which makes me understand why they gave the rating they did. The special effects were excellent and the plot and action was as well. The only drawback is we may never get to see another Star Wars film ever again but with respect to that this film was a good one to finish the series with. I really enjoyed the film and I hope it isn't too long until it come to video. Well done George Lucas! I give Revenge of the Sith 10 out of 10.",10,3,9,19 May 2005
Shrek," Really funny.
","This is the best animated movie I have ever seen. It is not only good for children but it is good for adults too. I loved it, especially Donkey played by Eddie Murphy, he did a lot of the jokes. Mike Myers as Shrek was funny as well. I recommend this for both adults and children. I give it 10 out of 10.",10,1,2,9 January 2004
Bruce Almighty," Pretty goofy
","It would be fun to be god for a week but hard work too and this film proves it. There was a good cast that was picked for this movie but Jim Carrey was the best of all of them. I loved what Bruce did to Eban Baxter when he became god, that was pretty funny. I give it 10 out of 10.",10,7,14,21 January 2004
The Truman Show," A really good movie
","The first time I saw this movie, I was a bit confused as to what was going on but I rented it afterwards and then I started to figure it out. I have a feeling that Jim Carrey added a few jokes when he was filming this because they sounded like something he would do. It was an interesting story though but a thinker. i liked it 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,21 January 2004
Click," Really good movie!
","Click might not be the average Adam Sandler film most of his fans know about however, it is still really good. Click starts off as a normal Adam Sandler comedy and eventually drifts into a serious drama. The serious aspects of the film were one of the major features that made the film good. Other than the seriousness, it still is pretty funny. Even in some of the serious parts of the film Adam Sandler manages to express his humour in some way. Adam Sandler should continue to star in films rather than only produce them. Adam Sandler starring in his films are what make them good. I must say that Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken also did a great job in their roles as well. Adam Sandler you should continue to act in your films. You do a great job. I give Click 10 out of 10.",10,1,9,28 June 2006
Gangs of New York," One of the best movies I have ever seen.
",I enjoyed this movie. I did not enjoy it just because of the excessive violence or for it being a gangster movie but I enjoyed it because it had a good plot and the fact that Martin Scorcese decided to take a little bit of a different approach to ways his films are presented. This movie is not about the normal Italian mafia crime families that Scorcese usually presents in his films. Gangs of New York is a true story of battling gangs in 1860s New York city during the civil war. I will not spoil the ending of the film but I will state that if you see this movie. You will be surprised about the ending because I certainly was. Overall it was an excellent movie and it would come somewhere in my top 20 favorite movies of all time. Gangs of New York deserves a 10 out of 10.,10,1,2,12 December 2004
Gangs of New York," Scorsese's best.
","This film was a little bit gross but it is a great story. It is sort of like an 1860s gangster movie. I have only seen two Daniel Day Lewis films and he looks quite a bit different in Gangs of New York than his other movies. It is a good movie though, if you like Martin Scorsese movies, I recommend it, I give it 10 out of 10.",10,0,1,5 February 2004
