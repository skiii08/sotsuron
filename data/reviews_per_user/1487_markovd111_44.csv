Vertigo," Why Alfred?
","As with any Hitchcock's movie, you have an interesting plot and characters and atmosphere to remember. It is a little bit slow like most of his movies, but I think that's the way it had to be. All in all, it's a great movie. A masterpiece. I am adding it to my favorite movies list for sure. But, what's the problem then? The ending... I am aware that this movie wouldn't be this movie if it didn't have the ending it has and I am mostly OK with tragic endings, but this one felt so... Forced... I was waiting for a happy ending and then all we get is... That... I guess I am too romantic haha Anyway, given this review is my subjective opinion, I guess you won't mind me giving it an 9/10, since I really can't get over that ending. Still, if you haven't watched this yet, I recommend it to you wholeheartedly, because the praise this movie get's is well earned! :D ;)",9,2,2,30 July 2019
In Bruges," A depressing but purifying and beautiful movie!
","The movie is slow. It's not an action movie and it's not dynamic. It's, for a bigger part, a movie about friendship, sins, our deeds and consequences that follow. Performances are good and memorable and the soundtrack is brilliant, though you may not notice it at first. It all starts to feel like some sort of a dream very soon when you start to understand the messages movie is sending. Humor is black and at the times very fun, thus making the movie less of a pain to make through and giving it style. And, as the movie goes, you begin to understand. Bruges, in this movie doesn't represent a dreamlike place. Or better yet, it does. But it isn't heaven. Nor hell. It's that one in between. A purgatory. I give it 10/10, but I recommend it to you only if you are in mood for a depressing movie which will make you think about it's story and try to analyze it. And I recommend bringing a friend for a ride. It's easier that way...",10,0,1,5 October 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Quentin Tarantino's WW2 movie!
","Not repeating what others have said about this movie, I can only confirm the fact that the movie is great. It's acting and pacing are top notch, making every second of it a joy. Sadly, Tarantino gives himself liberty with the facts and while that doesn't make the movie less appealing and fun, it does make it to have a far less impact on us as the viewers that way. In the other hand, I'm glad that this movie isn't another 'Schindler's List', but rather just a good WW2 movie that at the end of the day still doesn't take itself too seriously, while being about a serious theme. And that's Tarantino for you, ladies and gentleman. It's not a perfect movie. But sure is a very good one. 8/10 and a warm recommendation! :D",8,1,2,15 February 2020
Underworld," As close to 'Vampire: The Masquerade' movie we will probably ever come!
","Explanation of the title: Yes, I'm aware this is far from the thing I mentioned, but 'Underworld' is really the first movie to delve in to vampire politics, that's why I draw the comparison, so don't get triggered.
Review: I watched this movie as a kid and returning to it now, 10+ years later, I was expecting cringe and aged effects. Well, I am happy to say that, despite it's age, 'Underworld' is still a great and very fun movie. Of course, it isn't a masterpiece, far from it. But it's what I think movie about vampires should be. My objections? Action could be better... A lot, lot better. If only someone who knew how to make good shooting scenes worked at the movie, we would have a gun fu epic, this way it's just average most of the time. Though I didn't watch the rest of the series, I know the quality sinks lower with every movie, so, if you need to watch one and be done with it, it would be this one, and not the prequel or sequels (and I doubt watching the prequel or sequels will change my mind). Al in all, it's a good blockbuster with decent acting, great main character and interesting story. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride while it lasts, and don't ask too much questions :D 8/10! I recommend it!",8,1,1,4 February 2020
Dawn of the Dead," Well...
","Seeing the glorious reviews, I expected nothing but a good zombie fun. What I got was... Well... Let's just say the first half of the movie is bad... Characters aren't acting realistic, nor according to the situation and the movie is trying too much to be serious by exploring some themes and there are sexual scenes sprinkled all through the movie... It just feels wrong... No nihilistic feeling of dread and depression like the first Romero's trilogy. Oh, and the zombies aren't slow, they run. Then the second part of the movie starts, and things finally get together... What you get in second part is practically 'Left 4 Dead' in a movie, which is no surprise, because the movie probably served as an inspiration for the game. And while it lasts, it's awesome... Aaaand, then they ruin it with the credits scene. I can understand why people like it, and on it's own, it's OK movie, but compared to the original, it's bad. Remake of the 'Night of the Living Dead' was much better than this. I give it 6/10. Zombie fans will be right at home here, but forget about any kind of horror (it's just jumpscares whole way through).",6,1,1,11 June 2019
12 Monkeys," GREAT!
","Again, one of those kind of movies you can't rate objectively because it's so good, finding flaws in it would be nitpicking... It's great, awesome, well thought out and acted, edited perfectly. It also has some very memorable characters and scenes which will stay in you as long as you are alive. It's good, it's great and you should watch it and appreciate it... Or you won't... But no matter your opinion, saying that this movie is bad is just a plain lie... It's what movies are made for... To invoke thoughts, emotions... And while I prefer watching 'easier' movies, from time to time, man should watch something like this and say: 'Thank you God for film making industry and thank you for allowing masterpieces like this to exist!' 10/10 from me :)",10,0,0,27 April 2019
Shaun of the Dead," This, ladies and gentleman, is how you make a good horror comedy!
","Ordinary man whose life is falling apart experiences zombie apocalypse and get's a chance to redeem himself. Good, well written and masterfully acted characters, critique of modern way of life, great pop cultural references, puns and a sense for style. You heard it all, if you haven't, go watch it and realize I'm telling you the truth. It's really good. I have a few minor complaints here and there, but it's nothing that can really make this movie bad. 9/10 from me and a warm recommendation.",9,1,2,4 July 2019
Green Room," Well... OK...
","'Green Room' is a weird movie. I don't think it knows what it wants to be. It's not a bad movie, but... I dunno... It's not that good either. I expected something full of adrenaline, violence, and tension, but nahh... Whenever movie get's close to doing something like that, realism kicks in and ruin's it. For instance, there's a scene where the crowds is going wild while the band plays their song, and the movie cut's out the music. You start thinking the movie will start delving into the mind of neo nazi movement, but movie throws it out the windows few minutes later. It is never explored as a theme, it's just there. We are neo nazis. We are bad. We do bad stuff. Then it shifts to a thriller. Then when you think horror will kick in, it doesn't. There is never that sense of dread or feeling helpless while following the story of our heroes. Not everything is bad though. There are some tense moments, and Patrick Stewart is in it, and he is doing pretty good job, and there are some cool ideas, but ultimately it fails to do anything really good. I'ts all over the place. Credits soundtrack is cool though. I would give somewhere in between 6-7 stars, but since I can't, I'll rather go with the 6. It's not bad or anything, but it just exists. It's fun to watch once and forget about it.",6,0,1,11 January 2019
Knives Out," Not what I expected and what I saw didn't make me appreciate it any more...
","Having quality actors and good critical reception, I thought this movie will be fun, so I watched it with my mom, as we love those 'Clue/Cluedo' style comedy movies. I expected a comedy about weird characters in a mansion trying to solve a murder. Sadly, movie takes a different turn, innovates and changes the old formula of movie like this. This is sad not because of the sole fact that the formula is changed, but because the movie felt really long and boring. It's ending is fun, but... Yeah... This is actually just a classic crime movie, with a few humorous moments. And nothing else. Having in mind the great cast, I expected so much more from this movie and can't help but to fell really disappointed. It could have been so much more! Eh... It's not a bad movie.... It's an OK movie... But not a great one for sure. 6.5/10! It can still be fun and give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much, because you simply won't find it here...",6,15,20,16 February 2020
The Fifth Element," A blockbuster with a lesson!
","It would be wrong to regard 'The Fifth Element' as a mere blockbuster with good actors, beautiful visuals and fun plot. Yes, it is all of that, but what I think is most important are last 15 minutes of the movie. They raise it to a whole new level. Movie is full of charm and features legendary acting from even more legendary actors. There are a lot of memorable and funny scenes. Music is combined with scenes nicely and we can't forget the cult Plava Laguna performance. I give it a 10/10 and urge you to watch it and enjoy it, particularly it's cliched, but, oh, so beautiful ending. Luc Besson, you sure knew how to make movies once...",10,2,3,20 September 2019
Blade," No blood on that blade...
","Blade has one of the most cool openings of any super hero movies. It is with pain that I watched the rest of the movie, seeing how all of that could be so much better than it is. My biggest issue with this movie actually has nothing to do with story or acting. No... It's about blood. When Blade enters that club at the beginning of the movie, you expect to see a monstrous bloodshed. I mean, it's not like it's problem to show blood, they already drenched the whole club in blood. But no, when Blade kills vampires, they just disintegrate. Why?! It feels so out of place and wrong, it literally pains me to see action scene potential not being used to it's fullest. So, what you have left is vampire killing machine who kills vampires, but that killing doesn't look as nearly as spectacular and fun as it could look. And when you add to it the odd pacing of the movie and the way characters are developed, it doesn't really make us care all that much and in the end, you are left with really mediocre movie that could have been so much better if it's makers knew what they wanted to do. 6/10, try to watch it for fun...",6,0,0,24 November 2019
Constantine," Didn't read the comic book!!!
","Look at the rating as a 6.5.. Plot is all over the place and I had to stop watching the movie 3 times, because I was bored. If you are not a comic book fan, it's not gonna make much sense, even if you are familiar with the Christian mythos. Actors are doing a good job most of the time. Keanu is decent, and Stormare does an excellent job! Consider it more as a more serious Dr. Who, which deals with Christian mythos instead of sci-fi. There isn't a lot of action, and when there is, it's nothing to write home about. As I mentioned, first half of the movie is boring, but it picks up after that. It's nothing glorious and majestic, but it can be fun, if you have the patience and you will probably like it more if you read the comic book. Give it a try :)",7,1,2,17 March 2019
Aquaman," Uninspired...
","'Aquaman' can't be a more generic hero movie than it is. It feels like a mish mash of everything. It's a nice fun for popcorn eaters, but not more than that. Jason Momoa, while somewhat likable, got the role only because of his looks and not because of the acting (I can never forgive, never forget, how he raped the character of Conan... Whose idea was to give a Samoan chance to play a barbarian clearly inspired by the people of the north?! And don't even get me started on Khal Drogo...), so he can be eye candy. And I'm OK with that, but let's just please not commend him for acting, at least not yet, until he hasn't acted in something demanding. Movie was fun to watch, but it fails to be anything more than a fun blockbuster you watch and then forget about it, until you see it on TV 10 years later. It's a shame, after memorable Suicide Squad, that we had to come to this. Do I recommend the movie? Yes, for fun, it can serve it's purpose. Is it a masterpiece or worthy to be talked about or even remembered? Most definitely not. 7/10!",7,1,4,1 April 2020
Deadpool 2," An amazing improvement and a good and enjoyable movie!
","When 'Deadpool' was coming out, I was hyped. I watched the trailer constantly, action was cool, Ryan Reynolds perfect for the role. All in all it seemed great. Critics loved it, people loved it, everyone loved it... So when I finally started watching it with my older brother, we were expecting nothing but a good movie. What we got was overglorified origin story with limited budget, disjointed plot and a humor like it was long episode of 'South Park'. Whole armies of guys in mindset like: 'MAN! THE MOVIE IS SO COOL! THEY MAKE PUNS, JOKES AND BREAK THE FORTH WALL! AND HE SWEARS AND KILLS PEOPLE AND THERE'S BLOOD AND STUFF! 10/10! MASTERPIECE! LOVE YOU RYAN REYNOLDS!', defended the movie and praised it... And I was like... OK?... It was OK, but nothing special. 6/10 at best. Best parts of the movie were action scenes and Deadpool's relationship with the taxi driver which was the only thing in the movie that got us laughing. And then came 'Deadpool 2' and I again liked the trailer. But this time I was skeptical. I waited and now that I finally watched it, I must say it's good... First few minutes I thought I'm in for more of the same, but then it switches to the real thing and it is such an improvement that I can't praise it enough. Story finally makes sense, Deadpool has reason he does things, action is even cooler, though lack of practical effects hurts me, but still... I laughed, I enjoyed it, I even almost cried at some parts. It's still the old ride of jokes and seriousness, but it's so great this time, that everyone can have fun with this movie. 8.8/10 from me and a very warm recommendation. Watch it for some great fun, laughs and entertainment and even some drama :D ;)",8,1,1,24 May 2019
The Terminator," A classic action movie!
","I remember staying up late as a kid to watch this movie and being pretty satisfied with it. I watched it again some time to go to see if nostalgia googles are blinding me and movie is bad, or it's actually really that good. And, what a surprise, it's a good movie! It's fast, has cool story, action sequences and even cooler antagonist. I don't remember why I gave it 9/10 in the first place and not 10/10. I probably thought it would be too much for an action movie. This still is, after all, just a good action movie without a lot of those 'mindblown' and 'deep' moments. But it sure is cool. 9/10 it is, and a recommendation, if you still haven't watched it by this time, which I don't really believe haha :D",9,0,3,7 September 2019
Blade II," What every Blade fan wanted and more!
","Moving from the first movie which was bit of mess, though still pretty cool, we have an amazing sequel. We can't thank del Toro enough for this movie. It has amazing action, cool style, interesting characters, great main protagonist and fitting soundtrack. Disintegration of vampires is still present, but at least it now looks a lot more cool compared to the first movie. In fact, I am now pretty OK with it. So, what more can you ask for from a movie like this? Having seen 'Hellboy' and this movie, it seems del Toro was a real savior of the comic book based movies, and I can only say: 'Thank you!' I give the movie 9/10, because even though this is everything what movie about Blade should be, we need to take into account what movies deserve 10/10 score, and those are masterpieces. 'Blade II' is a good movie, but a masterpiece it is most assuredly not. Still, a warm and big recommendation! :D",9,0,0,6 January 2020
Suicide Squad," Watched director's cut and was amazed!
","OK, hear me out. I love both MARVEL and DC., but MARVEL has cooler and more creative super heroes while DC doesn't. But MARVEL has boring and unimaginative bad guys and DC has better ones. In that spirit, I enjoyed almost every second of this movie. Performances were amazing and I am very thankful to Margot Robbie for making Harley Quinn popular. I am not, however, thankful to Jared Leto who made Joker a gangster who was kicked in the head during childhood. Despite that, movie is filled with good atmosphere and music which fits with the scenes very well, making it an enjoyable ride. One thing that people also don't seem to understand. This is not an action movie. This is movie about bad guys. Their point of view. And I am thankful that they still show to us they are bad, even if we are somehow rooting for them to win. Will Smith is great in his roles, and so is everyone else in fact. Even Leto has charming moments when he is on scene with Harley, even though their portrayal isn't really based on comics and point of Joker and Harley was never love. All in all, I could rant about this movie for hours, but, what's the point? If you like DC and want a movie about their bad guys, you will enjoy. If you are looking for a casual fun ride, you maybe won't really be satisfied completely with it. 8.5/10! It could have been better, but in my eyes, it has a unique atmosphere, great cast and it was first who did what it did, so it will always be the best for me! :D",8,0,0,16 March 2020
Taxi Driver," Scorsese knows how to tell a story!
","I am constantly amazed how Scorsese manages to make everything interesting. The story of alienation of one taxi driver seems like the last thing I would want to watch, but he somehow makes it not only interesting, but even enjoyable. It's a good movie, from it's story to performances and the soundtrack. Scenes taking place during the night are where the real soul of this movie hides and they really transport you to dark and dangerous streets of the city in the small hours. I give the movie 10/10 as my subjective opinion and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a story which explores the society of late 70-s New York and shows how far one ordinary man might go when he loses it...",10,0,0,21 February 2020
Shutter Island," Something more than an amazing thriller!
","While everyone in the reviews section is busy talking how this movie has an amazing plot twist, I would like to stress out something else. While all of that is true, you should also note that the location on which this movie takes place could be seen like a state of mind. Whole movie is actually one psychological journey, full of suspense, discovery, denial and constant dance of truth and lie. It has an amazing atmosphere, acting and in some scenes border on pure horror with clever use of sound and visuals. There is also a sense of freedom in interpretation of the movie, and when the movie makes me think about it for a long time after watching it, it really mean's it something extraordinary. I give it 10/10 and I urge you to watch it! It's good! :)",10,1,2,28 December 2019
Léon: The Professional," A very good movie!
","The kind of movie that makes memories of enjoyment while watching it. It's full of charm and good acting and makes you really like it's plot and characters. I could go on and talk about the movie, but since it's a cult classic already, I will only say that I'm adding this one to my favorite movies list. Go and watch it, it's a movie from a time when Luc Besson still made good movies. 9/10!",9,1,1,28 July 2019
28 Weeks Later," Mehhh...
","There is a lot of questionable editing in this movie. Whenever there's action, screen is littered with a lot of random shots which job is to portray the carnage which is going on, but it looks out of place and is not necessary. Romero's zombie movies are a perfect example of that, though zombies in this movie are much more fast, so it can be explained that way, but it still feels hard to watch. Movie redeems itself with a few cool dreadful scenes and with a lot of tension throughout the movie, which replaces the scares of the first one. All in all, it's a decent movie, just don't expect something on an art level. It's just a movie to watch for fun ( because characters don't really succeed in making you care for them that much ) .",7,3,4,24 March 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Can you smell it?! It's the smell of nineties in the air! That's how perfect action movie smells like!
","I gave the first part 9/10... Why? While it was amazing and thrilling experience, in my opinion, there was a lack of connection with the characters. Sure, they are cool, but still, there was too little time to develop them fully. With extended edition of this movie which runs two and a half hours and bigger budget for even better amazing action scenes, this movie has it all, improves the shortcoming of the original and I think it will forever be a nostalgic love trip for everyone who wants a good action movie packed with nineties feel and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton. I could go on and praise the movie, but why? So many people already did it way better than me, for me only thing left to do is recommend it to you with whole size of my heart. Go on, and enjoy this action masterpiece along with it's everlasting message and thoughts on human nature. And yeah, I still get teary eyed at the ending of this movie. Ever since I was a kid. 10/10, hasta la vista, baby!",10,2,2,29 September 2019
The Usual Suspects," From a sleeping pill to a masterpiece!
","I stopped watching the movie after 20 minutes of it. I was bored. I didn't care for any of the characters, I didn't have sympathy for any of them, movie was kinda spoiled for me by some review I read here (which claimed it doesn't have spoilers) and I was tired. When I finally continued with the watching of the movie, I was hooked and enjoyed every minute of it, not knowing how it will end to the very last minutes of it. From the great acting to a good script and the way it's presented and masterfully edited, this movie has it all. And the ending, along with it's last sentence reminded me with it's strength of 'Se7en'. It's a good movie. A very good movie. I give it 10/10 and I recommend it to all people who say that they love movies and mean it.",10,0,1,26 September 2019
Die Hard 2," A mighty fine sequel!
","Let's face it. You are here because you like the first movie. And you are probably asking yourself is the sequel good as the original. Well, while it isn't exactly as good as the first one, it is still a very good action movie. Everything you liked from the first part is still here, from over the top action scenes, magically charismatic Bruce Willis, to warm and well known Reginald VelJohnson, 2 other returning actors and some new decent ones. It isn't a masterpiece, but it doesn't need to be. It's good, enjoyable and fun movie which you should watch if you liked the first one! 9/10! Enjoy! :D ;)",9,2,2,23 November 2019
Resident Evil," Given the source material and time it was made...
","Making a movie based on a video game has only lately, when things in the industry are different, proved to be a good move. 'Resident Evil' tries it's best, but instead of survival horror, we have action movie mixed with horror. Only 'scares' present in this movie are jumpscares. Milla Jovovich is bland as a main character, Michelle Rodriguez being a far better suited for the role. Action is mostly bad and the best parts come in form of, ironically, hand to hand fighting with zombies (Jovovich). Story has a good idea, but it all falls flat with the atmosphere. It's jut when you watch a movie and you feel like you are not enjoying it, forcing yourself to watch it. Same is with this one. I wouldn't watch it again. As far as video game adaptations go, this one is good for it's time, but now, it isn't very good. Still, if you want to pass some time and are a fan of the games, knock yourself out. 5.5./10 (for a video game adaptation), 6/10 (for an action horror movie).",5,0,2,20 February 2020
Saving Private Ryan," Masterpiece
","This is THAT kind of movie... There is no point in rating it and being objective... It's just impossible... Watch it and decide for yourself... It's great, it's hard to watch, emotional, well shot and masterfully acted... 10/10 from me...",10,0,1,21 April 2019
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Something different and gorgeous at that!
","It's Wes Anderson's movie all the way. Visuals are gorgeous, characters odd and interesting and humor is mostly on the spot. Only thing I didn't really like was the movie's ending. It feels kinda abrupt, though it's not without it's strength. I watched it with a mate and we almost constantly laughed and enjoyed the charm of the movie, especially when things start to heat up. It really has the feeling of a good and memorable movie. I give it 10/10 and I recommend it if you want a fun and beautiful comedy movie crafted with love and care and not some rubbish that usually comes out of Hollywood labeled as comedy, when it's not even close.",10,1,1,5 October 2019
It Follows," Was relieved when it finally ended...
","While the idea of being followed by something which takes the form of creepy looking and dressed, often naked people sounds creepy, but it's the plot itself and uninteresting characters that destroy this movie's potential the most. Whole idea of story having a deeper meaning through references to literature and sex being both the cause and cure of problem is just so unnecessary and the whole thing would have worked a whole lot better if it was made in the vein of old movies, like, for example, 'Carnival of Souls'. It all boils down to the fact that this movie isn't fun and isn't scary. It feels creepy at few scenes, but that can't help it from falling below my bar of mediocrity. I give it 5.5./10. It's not the worst movie you can watch, but it really isn't any good either.",5,1,1,8 December 2019
Get Out," A decent thriller with some unnecessary politics thrown in the mix!
","I am all for racial equality. We are all men and should treat each other that way. And that said, there are better movies on the theme of racism. Theme of racism in 'Get Out' feels forced and is even pure cringe at some times. And at one point in the movie, when I figured what was plot about, I was like: 'What? Really?! That's... What?!' 'Get Out' is a decent thriller and I would lie if I told I wasn't interested and that I didn't want to know what will happen next. Scenes are very well put together. Daniel Kaluuya and Lil Rel Howery give some great performances to the movie and their communication serves as a comic relief to what is essentially 'very serious and dark movie wannabee'. They make this movie so much more enjoyable that watching it without them is hard to imagine. I give 'Get Out' 7/10, and that is only because of the said performances. As I said, it's a decent thriller, but horror it is most surely not.",7,3,6,3 August 2019
Hellboy," Not perfect, but still very good!
","There was a lot of talk about Hellboy when the movie came out. A demon who fights with rosary on the good side. And while it's weird, having finally seen the movie, I think it's far less wrong than things like 'Lucifer'. It works in it's comic book world and it works well. Del Toro does know how to make a fun movie and Ron Perlman is great in his role. Sadly, the movie does suffer from pacing issues and feeling that the characters are constantly doing something not very relevant to the main plot. To use a gaming dictionary, it feels they are constantly doing side quests. That is a shame, because when it comes to action, characters, or anything else for that matter, Hellboy delivers. It even has a good message. And while there are a few last decade cringe scenes, even that is cool in retrospective. It's just sad that it couldn't be much more than just a good movie. But, oh well, be happy with what you have, they say. I give it 7.5 and I recommend it!",7,0,1,29 December 2019
Ghostbusters," A classic piece of fun and ghostbusting!
","While I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, 'Ghostbusters' is one good movie which I really enjoyed watching. However, I found it to be really full of sexual innuendos which I remembered from when I watched the movie as a kid. I am not a snowflake and I grew on far worse stuff, but PG rating for this movie seems a little bit off. Still, it's very good and fun, so what more can you ask from the movie about catching ghosts? Bill Murray's character can be irritating at times, but hey, it's part of the movie's charm. 8/10 and a recommendation!",8,1,1,30 December 2019
From Hell," A good thriller loosely based on a graphic novel!
","I enjoyed watching this movie. It isn't historically accurate, but it doesn't need to be. It's fun and enjoyable movie from start to finish. Author of the graphic novel wasn't really amazed by Johnny Depp performance, but I find it charming, because it's a portrayal of a relatively normal man. Later Depp really lost it and shown us he cannot really act normal, and that turned him from my most beloved actor to... Well, what he is now. Anyway, the movie is very well executed, characters are fun and the plot is interesting and makes you care. Costumes and scenes are great, as well as the atmosphere. However, don't expect a horror, because you won't find it. It's more of a crime thriller. Movie also manages to make you hate Jack the Ripper, so that's a plus. He really is despicable, killing poor women in a way like that. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to anyone looking for a decent thriller. It's charming and won't make you regret your choice. 8/10 from me :) ;)",8,1,2,25 July 2019
Reservoir Dogs," A classic for a reason!
","Tarantino's debut in film making is a great movie... From the clever and oh, so stylish shots (scene in which the group walks in slow motion has a legendary status by now) in each scene, to a fantastic acting. It has it all... It deserves praise it gets, though I can't help to feel he even overdoes it with constant swearing. You feel like you are watching boys in the primary school argue because someone rattled them to the teacher for doing something bad. But I guess it's just his way of showing us how they are 'losing it'. Still, it is what it is... It's fun and interesting , characters aren't one-dimensional and it's a joy to watch. You either like this movie or you don't. So, from that subjective perspective, I give it 10/10 :)",10,0,0,20 May 2019
Zombieland," Family movie disguised as a horror comedy!
","I am actually so happy with watching this movie that I immediately need to recommend it to you if you like zombies and if you like having a good laugh. Humor is not tasteless and stupid, characters are great and movie's style is fantastic. I was laughing like an idiot and every single one of the actors is giving a marvelous performance. It's very hard to make a good horror movie. It's even harder to make a good horror comedy. But while this movie isn't scary, unless you count the presence of the zombies, it sure is hilarious and enjoyable in it's innovative presentation. 10/10!",10,0,0,1 October 2019
Die Hard," Definitive one man army movie!
","What do you get when you mix late 80-s style action movie with a little romance, good plot and setting with Bruce Willis as protagonist, Alan Rickman as villain and Reginald VelJohnson as a sidekick? You get a movie for an eternity! It's cool, it's fun, fast, packed with adrenaline and that feeling when you root for the protagonist to win. In my country, the name of the movie is literally translated as: 'Die like a man', so it's definitely a movie you watch when you feel down and don't feel that your ego is alive. I give it 10/10! I recommend it to everyone! Enjoy the classic!",10,3,3,13 October 2019
Speed," So 90-s you will be hurt by nostalgia!
","Even if you didn't experience the joy of 90-s culture in your own life, you can notice it in the music and movies. That being said, this movie is a true testament to that. Featuring young Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock ( this was her breakthrough role, and some people even today view her through this role) on a bus that can't drop below 50 miles per hour, or it will explode, you have a great concept. What you get from that concept is a 1 hour of pure action and that 90-s movie chemistry between the characters (especially between Keanu and Sandra) followed by negotiations with the bomber. It's a real blast (no pun intended) from the past, and with that said, you can easily overlook it's little flaws and unrealistic scenes. It's such a joy to watch and fills your heart with warmness, so it should be appreciated for that. Not a lot of movies today pull that off. 8.5/10 from me, and a warm recommendation! Enjoy! :D ;)",8,3,3,19 June 2019
Rear Window," 1 cm close to perfection!
","This movie is cult classic and I don't really need to tell you much about it. I enjoyed it immensely. I liked the setting, plot, acting, characters and great and cozy mood and tension. What I didn't like was the ending fight. And yes, I'm taking into the account the year this movie was made, but it's still pretty unbelievable. No one is so stupid to get blinded 4 times in a same way and no one trying to kill somebody would be that slow. Still, this is just minor and personal flaw and it doesn't destroy the fact that this is a true testament to that 'Old, but gold!' saying. 9/10 from me, and a recommendation as warm as a temperature in this movie :D ;)",9,1,1,10 July 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Watchable!
","Given the treatment vampires got in recent decades, turning them from horrible monsters to wet dream of every teenage girl wanting sensuality, powerful man and protection, I was expecting this movie to be barely watchable. Given that it also features Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas as handsome men women like, I was also expecting to puke at the every minute of this movie. But it isn't like that. It's bearable. It's overly melodramatic, yes, and it has sensuality, but it isn't even close to 'Twilight' and 'Vampire Diaries' type of stuff I expected. And it's good. I enjoyed watching it. However, day after, I asked myself: 'What did you watch?' I haven't read the books, and I am aware that one whole hour of movie is missing, so maybe that would be better than this, but it still doesn't change the fact that this movie is what it is. A costumed charade with vampires and a little bit of philosophy about life and death and things. Having said that, it's still better than what 2000s and + gave vampire genre. 7.5/10 You won't make a very big mistake watching this :)",7,2,3,23 July 2019
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Just your usual Monty Python...
","As much as I love British humor and TV series like 'Allo Allo' or 'Fawlty Towers', I couldn't help but to feel a little bored watching this movie... Yes, it's classic, yeah it has all those great and bizarre scenes, but it starts to drag after a while, and then you laugh, and then it drags, and then you laugh... I don't know how to rate it. It's better than average, but if you are not in the right mindset for a movie like this and for that bizarre side of British humor, you will be exhausted by the movie. I am giving it a 8/10 for that reason, because a PERFECT comedy should be accessible to all people at all times, and Monty Python is like a British 'South Park'. I had to watch this movie with friends, because I couldn't make myself to watch it alone... You might think reading this review that I don't like Monty Python at all... I do, but I have to be objective; not everyone will like this...",8,0,0,19 March 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," Meta horror movie
","As a horror movie veteran, I found this to be a beautiful experience filled with homage's to other horror movies such as 'Evil Dead', 'Scarecrows' etc. Movie criticizes how horror movies have become stale and predictable. While I agree, there wouldn't be any horror movie fans without cliches. Whatever we say, everybody loves cliches if they are done right and nothing can beat the old 'horny campers and a crazy deformed killer' routine. Anyway, back to the movie: The cast is great, story even better, movie is full of laughs and one of the 2 main characters is a pothead who looks and acts like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo. Perfect, if you ask me. So, do yourself a favor if you are horror movie fan and watch this great movie. You won't be disappointed, because this is what a good blend of horror and comedy should be! :) ;)",8,2,3,10 March 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," George Miller, I salute you!
","This is one of these movies that you cannot rate objectively. What I can say is that I in a long time haven't seen such masterful execution of action scenes. It's like a big puzzle which is put together rapidly in front of your eyes. Action in this movie is so great, that you sometimes can't register all that's happening on screen. Tom Hardy is a great replacement for Mel Gibson and Charlize Teron is great and deserves her share of praise too. In fact, far more than her 'Atomic Blonde' 2 years later. Miller knows what he's doing and there is something passionistic in this movie. The whole idea which carries through the series of Max roaming the wasteland like some sort of a limbo, looking for redemption and hope. This is how you make a GOOD action movie. Everything is in it's place and you care for the characters. And the action will give you wet dreams. I give it 10/10 and I'm not exaggerating. It deserves it. If you haven't, go watch it and see for yourself. If I was being a nitpicker, only thing I can think of is little 'blah' are the 3D effects, which are not needed, but like I said, it's just nitpicking.",10,2,7,18 May 2019
Goodfellas," An expertly made movie!
","After watching 'Godfather', you would expect that every mafia movie has melodramatic scenes of mafia bosses wisely talking about the meaning of life with heavily forced accents. That can be tolerated to some extent, but get's boring pretty fast. Luckily, 'Goodfellas' is nothing like it. It's fast and enjoyable to watch, without a lot of drama. There is not much stalling and I like that. I especially liked that characters tell their own story. And the way that shots are compiled into a movie feel so right, and you just know you are watching a good movie. Performances of all actors are magnificent. It's a fine example of a good movie and I recommend it wholeheartedly, and there is nothing bad I can say about the movie. It even has some sort of happy ending, so I don't know what's not to like. 10/10",10,0,1,1 August 2019
The Great Gatsby," A missed opportunity!
","You can see a potential in this movie. Sadly, the premise was used to make a fancy and fast blockbuster without much soul, heavily relying on colors, CGI, and Leonardo DiCaprio to make it appeal to the masses. The later starts acting only in the second part of the movie, the whole plot is faster and you can see why everyone is complaining to the soundtrack. Yeah, it's made to fit by the great use of scenography, but, still, where's jazz in the movie about the time of jazz?! Instead we get rap and pop... We hear foxtrot once, and it's the best piece of music in the whole movie. The last 30 minutes of movie are the best and alone make watching feel great, which is good, because if it was to be judged by the rest of the movie, it would be very bad. Casting is good for the most part, though I would prefer someone else for the role of Daisy and Jordan, but it is what it is. It is a good movie, but not a good adaptation of the book. Joel and Toby do a good job though. I am giving it 6.5/10",6,1,2,16 April 2019
The Wizard of Oz," Timeless classsic!
","Probably the first time I have known, from the moment I watched it on VHS as a kid in my grandma's and grandpa's house, a movie will become a big part of me and stay with me through my whole life. Such a simple and warm story about friendship, magic of a child's mind and adventure. Beautifully set and painted scenes, perfect actors and eternally memorable songs along with a story of one of the most legendary authors of children literature make from this movie a lot more than almost 2 hours of movie tape. They make an unforgettable experience which invokes nostalgia, emotions, joy, laughter and they live with you forever. Even now, with 20 years on my shoulders, I can't help myself but to get all teary eyed at the scene where Dorothy is parting with her friends and that will probably be the case for the rest of my life. I can say a lot about this movie, but there are too little words to describe something like that, so just let me recommend it to you with whole of my warm heart! 10/10, a timeless classic!",10,1,3,9 August 2019
