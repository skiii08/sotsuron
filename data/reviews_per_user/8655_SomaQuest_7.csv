Blade Runner 2049," Technically A Masterpiece
","Whether or not you agree with a sequel to the original classic or not you must pay homage to Ridley Scott's absolutely incredible use of special effects for their ability to truly create an immersive world for a cinematic experience. Clearly following the logical progression from the previous installment set approximately 40 years prior to this film Scott uses his visuals in such a way as you feel that the world of Blade Runner has simply aged appropriately.This film was billed in it's previews as a Harrison Ford vehicle, however, his role is not nearly at the forefront until well past the halfway mark of the film. Ryan Gosling plays his role perfectly as does Jared Leto in this underappreciated appearance. All subsequent secondary characters are well designed and thought out and the plot, arguably, is quite intriguing.In regards to all the failures in reboots we have seen in the past five years this stands out among the ones that are done correctly and at a time appropriate for their revival.A film well worth watching even at the run time of 164 minutes.",8,2,5,5 October 2018
Spider-Man 3," A Bubblegum Version Of Villainy Doesn't Suit The Series
","In my humble opinion this film is at the bottom tier of the Spiderman saga.Overproduced and overacted this film is a travesty to the darkness that is Venom, not to mention that the story strays so far from the essence of the original that Venom comes across as a teenage boy in heat. Those points being mentioned there are some amusing parts and although overdone the special effects were groundbreaking for 2007.Spiderman has seen so many incarnations over the years, each trying to outdo its predecessor - although this version broke the bank in terms of budget, it fell short on all perceivable aspects.",4,1,2,14 October 2018
The Village," Shyamalan's Best Film
","Forget for a moment what you know about Shyamalan's tendency to 'twist' each movie, this has been done by directors for years, and look at this film in it's entirety and you will see how well put together it is.Although billed as a 'horror' movie this film is not one in any aspect. The Village is a study in psychology, sociology, family, grief, love and the endless possibilities opened up when people put themselves toward a common goal. In all reality I would categorize this as a romance film. This film, which is underrated and over-criticized by the vast populous, is a brilliant piece of social commentary on many levels. True, some of the acting was overdone, and some foreshadowing was forced and arbitrary, but if you view it as a whole with no preconceptions of reviews you have seen, you will not be disappointed.",7,0,1,5 October 2018
Coco," A Heartfelt Addition To The Pixar Playlist
","Coco is a truly heartfelt and beautifully scripted coming of age film from the minds of the Pixar team. Taking a risk in our current climate with a Latin-based film, Pixar hit the ground running with this one and quite frankly 'nailed it.'I must say, I was originally sceptical of this film thinking it was Pixar's answer to The Book Of Love, but I was happily proven wrong. Although both films are partially set in the Land Of The Dead that is where the similarities end.A beautifully sculpted, written and directed film about the hubris of youth and how meeting ones heroes is never what is expected. I highly recommend this film for anyone with kids, who is a kid, who was a kid, who has a family or is thinking of a family. Quite frankly, I simply recommend this film for all that it brings to the table; culture, soul, redemption, love, loss and laughter.Watch this with the kids or by yourself, it is worth it on every level.",9,0,0,30 October 2018
Pulp Fiction," The Quintessential '90s Film
","I saw this movie nine times in the theater when it came out; it resonated so deeply on a level I couldn't explain at the time. Possibly it was the non-linear timeline of the plot, maybe it was the less-than-desirable content of the plot told in such an approachable way, maybe it was the easily memorable phrases and script or maybe it was the meticulously selected soundtrack that sourced from a host of decades and genres.The second directorial effort from then fairly unknown Tarantino but it was a brilliant sophomore effort hitting the proper notes on all the main categories; directing, score, cinematography, acting / casting, plot, writing, etc. I cannot suggest this film to everyone; you need a certain sense of humor and a certain means of looking at a plot-line to truly enjoy it, but for those that have those prerequisites this is required viewing.This film in my top tier and one that can be watched at any time. An extremely well constructed piece of film-making that is worthy of a viewing.",9,5,10,9 October 2018
American Made," Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction
","Put this one in the category of movies to watch when you are disenfranchised with the US Government as it will show you how we happily provide jobs to people of all walks of life through our outreach programs.I enjoyed the lighthearted direction and tongue-in-cheek retrospective of the US political outreach operations in Central America in the 1980s. A fine addition to the 'truth is stranger than fiction' category of 'historical' films. Cruise plays his role with a combination of Maverick and blissful ignorance tiptoeing through some of the geopolitical landmines that spotted the late seventies and eighties. A fun film that doesn't take itself too seriously, well acted, well shot, good production values, a fine watch.",7,0,1,7 October 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," A Rewarding Horror-Comedy
","Not many films can construct original, horror-comedy like Cabin In The Woods has done. Seamless story structure is backed by brilliant dark comedy blended with just the right amount of horror ambiance.Imagine the Truman Show if Cristo's character was Chutulu and you will have a grasp of what you are about to watch. Casting did a spectacular job with all roles, namely that of the external 'office workers.' This well designed and executed blend of college-horror and Office Space works on a host of different levels and has a bit of something for everyone.Cannot recommend this film highly enough. Films like this come around once in a blue moon and typically are underappreciated in every way; due you due diligence and appreciate the effortlessness of this film for what it is.",8,15,24,21 October 2018
