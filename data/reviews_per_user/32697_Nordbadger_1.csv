The Legend of Bagger Vance," Shadow of the real story.
","I think that in the simplest terms that this film is so enjoyable because of it's depiction of the real story. A man has to come to grips with his past failings, demons, and stand up and become a new person because the old person is gone. However, at the same time he cannot do it on his own strength, he requires help because he simply does not have the raw materials in himself to repair and make new. I think it misses the mark though in saying that the ultimate power is within ones self and that the power to be the best lies inside yourself. I do think that it is well worth the viewers time, Matt Damon and Will Smith both did excellent jobs!",9,0,1,21 July 2008
