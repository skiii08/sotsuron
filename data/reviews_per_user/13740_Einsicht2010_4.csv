Source Code," Quite Brilliant
","Source Code is one of those movies which make you think and really make you realize that unlike some filmmakers there are some intelligent and creative brains out there who still believe in quality cinema. In a nutshell, the movie is a Sci-Fi action thriller and is brilliantly shot. I said brilliant because of three reasons:-1.The way of storytelling. 2.The visibility of the scenes, dialogs and the overall script. 3.The quality of the direction.The technical aspects of the movie are not too hard to understand and you are always captivated and captured by the somewhat volatile happenings. The action in the movie is first-rate and does provide the buzz expected of an action thriller. Jake Gyllenhaal is a fine actor. He has portrayed the character of Colter Stevens, an American Army helicopter pilot, quite well if in not the best way possible. Vera Farmiga as Goodwin was convincing and looked appropriate in her place. Michelle Monaghan too acted well but her character had far less exposure and she had not a lot to do.For me the real winner here is the director, Mr. Duncan Jones, who has really put together a wonderfully captivating show. Definitely worth your time and money.",8,2,4,13 June 2011
Megamind," MegaMind - The Funniest villain ever
","An underachiever his whole life, when realizes that he is not good at doing anything noble, also comprehends that he is pretty darn good at being 'BAD'!!!, thus came into existence 'MEGAMIND', which according to me is 'the' funniest villain ever. MEGAMIND and his best friend MINION, did remind me of the duo of 'SULLY and MIKE' from Monsters Inc., but the bone-tickling comedy does make sure that the sometimes goofy 'super- baddie' wins hands down. The scene where MM corrects TITAN by explaining that the difference between a villain and a super-villain is PRESENTAATIIOOOOONNN!!!! , was the best of the lot for me.Amazing animation by Dreamworks yet again. Brad Pitt is too good as METROMAN, but Ferrell steals the show for me. Snappy scenes and witty dialogs make it a must watch for all age groups. Do take out some time for this one, coz you will definitely leave with a smile on your face and a thought in your mind",8,0,1,8 June 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," Be prepared to fall in a bowl of AWESOMENESS again as Po is back
","Okay!! Its official now, you can associate the word Awesome with Kung Fu Panda till eternity, because, it just is. I am not going to spill out the beans but here is the gist of it. Po is a pro in his own style of Kung fu and is aware of his abilities now. He is living his dream to be the Dragon Warrior. With the Furious Five he heads towards a city to save Kung Fu and in his fight against the evil, unravels his own origin.When I actually got up from my chair, I actually said these two words 'JUST AWESOME'. For me, Kung Fu Panda 2's USP is the story. The story was extremely important for the sequel especially when the first did set some mightily high standards to live up to. Good 3D effects & even better animation have undoubtedly added outstandingly to this exceptional movie. Even though Po achieved a new avatar, the lead character's trademark goofy manners had to be maintained because that's what makes the character adorable. Needless to say, Jake Black is tailor-made for this character. The man actually looks like Po, just kidding. The movie has hilariously funny moments mixed with heartwarming scenes as well. Its wittiness is immeasurable and is unexpected. Amidst, all the seriousness intended in the scenes, comedy has been stitched quite intelligently. Moreover, the direction is also worth applauding. Successfully stuffing a story which is as good as this one with an Panda(animated or otherwise) and Kung fu is definitely not a piece of cake and the director achieves that humongous task with ease as you highly connect with the emotions projected throughout the movie and you absolutely forget that the characters and the happenings are fictional. At the end you actually want more and that is when you realize that this awesome flick will be followed with something worth finding out about. But for the time being, be prepared to fall in a bowl of AWESOMENESS again as Po is back.",8,0,0,30 June 2011
Rio," Just Lovely
","I watched this movie on a lethargic Sunday night and must say that it was the perfect fashion to bring to an end an otherwise lousy day. In few words, Rio is a fantastically executed humorous flick packed with cute scenes and gorgeous animation. Though the movie was a bit obvious at times but the charming & highly amusing sequences don't let you take your eyes of the screen.Jesse Eisenberg's voice is amazingly immaculate for a bird and he does a great job playing the role of the domesticated exotic bird BLU, who doesn't know how to fly. And Anna Hathaway's voice was so sweet throughout the movie that I actually fell in love with the character JEWEL. NIGEL, their evil counterpart was well scripted and does present wickedness. Needless to say, Jemaine Clement did one heck of a job while lending his voice to the character.The scenes with the goofy monkeys were outstanding on the level of clowning and were as good as the penguins of Madagascar. Moreover, the drooling amigo the birds find during the end was definitely the highpoint as far as the comic element in the movie is concerned.Finally, the animation deserves an accolade as it was just magnificent and gorgeous. The movie is filled with vibrant colors and dazzling performances. I truly wish I had watched it in 3D but 2D is not so bad either, in fact it is pretty awesome!!!",7,0,0,8 June 2011
