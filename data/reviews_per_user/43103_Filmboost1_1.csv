Hereditary," It is no a disappointment, but....
","I was not convinced,..this film was quite good , but the the end of the film was a waste of time. It looked cheap that the character of peter was the new antichrist.I didn't make sense, because one character who disagree with the idea of an antichrist was that, he was so sad about his loss of his sister. His expressionof his sadness, was very authentic so he could never be the antichrist. But the cast was brilliant !!!So i call it a missed opportunity.Because I am a horrorfilm fan. My heart is bleading, there is nothing more to say.Best wishes to All.
