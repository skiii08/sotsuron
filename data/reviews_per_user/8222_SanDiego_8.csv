The Devil's Advocate," Connie Nielsen is gorgeous!
",If you enjoyed Connie Nielsen in 'Mission to Mars' be sure to see this film. She strips completely naked in front of Al Pacino and slowly spins full frontal and full rear for the movie audience.  Connie Nielsen looks a little like Dina Meyer and little like a young Kate Capshaw.  She is purely gorgeous and if you want to see her naked this is the best place.,Null,1,2,28 March 2000
The Beach," Talk about a polluted Beach. Stinko!
","Is it crazy yet for anyone to admit they saw a 'Leo DiCaprio' film? 'Titanic' should keep him doing films until December, but after that I imagine his career will match that guy who played Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars.  As you probably already know, 'The Beach' is a contender for worst film of the year.  'The Beach' is not the first film to stink up a theater, but what those jerks did to the natural habitat of Thailand should give Leo and company enough bad karma to keep their careers wedged between the Titanic and the bottom of the sea.  So will this film.",Null,0,1,8 February 2000
Pearl Harbor," Disney cartoon could have used Donald Duck.
","Splashy FX (CGI actually) can't save one of Hollywood's all time big bombs (and no, I'm not giving away the ending), a fictional soap opera spun around a real military attack (Bore-a! Bore-a! Bore-a!).  The bad (and sometimes laughable) performances (with sometimes odd casting choices) make this long movie even longer, and the audience's reward is a contrived ending (again based on another famous military attack) that proves that film makers really are even more stupid than they are on the Oscars and Politically Incorrect. Taking one part TITANIC and one part SAVING PRIVATE RYAN may have sound like a sound idea, but maybe if the Disney had actually tried to make a film about Pearl Harbor they would have made a good movie.  Instead this is just a really sloppy cartoon from a studio who is has done much better mixing live-action and animation.",Null,0,0,13 June 2001
Liar Liar," Not very original but a decent update.
","Remake of Bob Hope's NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH doesn't generate as much laughs but this one is a better written film, even though all-in-all the TV episode version done on BEWITCHED was about all the time that the plot really deserves (Jim C. looks a lot like Dick York so I guess the producers would going that route).  Not a bad flick but without Jim C. it would have been a made-for-TV flick for the Family Channel or a Canadian import.  You would think Jim C. would have enough clout not to make such stuff.",Null,0,0,22 July 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Kidman does have a nice butt.
","Some people think Kubrick is a genius (some people think the Church of Scientology is a religion...go figure).  Who cares?  I could care less if Nicole Kidman was a card carrying member of The UFO Worshippers of Hollywood Club.  What really matters is that Nicole Kidman is always a treat naked.  I could care less of the past credits of the director.  Kubrick or no Kubrick 'Eyes Wide Shut' should be judged on it's own merits.  Here's the merit of 'Eyes Wide Shut:'  Nicole Kidman is always a treat naked.  Not that she has a centerfold's body, but she looks great.  She was naked in the Dustin Hoffman flop 'Billy Bathgate' as well as earlier Australian efforts like 'Windrider' so 'Eyes Wide Shut' really needs to offer more than just a naked Nicole.  It doesn't.",Null,0,1,25 March 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Overlong, uninspired snooze fest.
","Co-star Richard Harris said of the book, 'It's not my cup of tea.'  This from a man who has probably read ever great novel and performed every great play written.  In other words, her prefers stories which stick to the ribs as opposed to cotton candy which will melt away in the shadow of adulthood. For a blockbuster film filled with special effects HARRY POTTER has surprising zilch to offer as far as groundbreaking cinema.  We've all seen films about magic, broomstick flying, monsters, etc... and though the production values are far beyond that of a CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG, they are not beyond that of SUPERMAN, and the story falls far from the film perfection of a MARY POPPINS or the classic literacy of C.S.Lewis.  The acting by the youngsters get the job done but don't expect to see much more of them (except for sequels), and the older famous counterparts give their usual professional turns that seem to be lifted from previous roles.  In essence, the hype of the books have carried over to carry the film.  The story line pales against the classics and there goes the real story.  Most college students would have a difficult time reading the classics by Verne, Stevenson, Homer, Melville(the original versions), and Harry Potter (a step above Dr. Seuss, but without the wit or satire) gives students a chance to say they have actually read a book that wasn't a comic book.  HARRY POTTER will be forgotten before the next generation arrives and be buried alongside PIPPY LONGSTOCKING in the LET'S-NOT-ADMIT-WE-ACTUALLY-ENJOYED-THIS crypt of forgotten lore.  But back to HARRY POTTER, a muddy muddle of a movie. England has never looked more drab, magic has never looked more insignificant, and Brits have never looked more stupid.  Chris Columbus, who did a terrific job with YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES shows none of the imagination he showed in that film.  Trimmed by an hour this film would be a nice diversion on children's TV, but as a cinematic event, it falls way too short.",Null,0,0,17 November 2001
Ice Age," Terrible, idiotic mess is my vote for worse film, so far, of 2002.
","Crude animation, inferior story, and few laughs makes this Monster, Inc./Shrek wannabe a painful example of how computer animation can not only raise the level of such story-telling, but lower it to new depths as well. Compare this film with early Warner Brothers such as Road Runner and Bugs Bunny (it's inspiration of sorts), or heck even new Speilberg Warner Brothers, and it falls way short despite sixty some years of progress.  Even a lesser Disney effort like Return to Neverland has more to offer in it's first two minutes than all of Ice Age.  All artistic merit has been abandoned in lieu of juvenile computer graphics and a tired story line. Just because the producers knew their intended audience would not demand more than a typical computer game does not mean they had to dive so low in the intelligence pool.  Don't expect kids seeing this film today sharing it with their own kids twenty years from now.  More likely they will be denying they even saw it.  My vote for the worse film, so far, of 2002.  Even if you consider Pokemon high art and Harry Potter classic literature this film doesn't even rise up to those darken depths for entertainment value.  If you're an idiot and want to feel smart go see Ice Age, you might feel smart, but you would still be an idiot, and you surely won't be entertained, just stuck in the Ice Age.",Null,0,0,17 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars is LEAST like which one? a. A Computer Game, b. A Comic Book, or c. Reading a Really Great Novel.
","Low budget, poorly acted, mostly computer animated kiddie fare of interest to computer geeks and comic book convention nerds.  Lacks the intelligence of '2001,' the passion of 'Close Encounters,' and the heart of 'E.T.' Watered down new age philosophy digested for those who never even heard of Sante Fe, New Mexico.  Grainy cinematography improved with newly improved special edition.  Followed by sequels.  (Without Alec Guinness the newest sequel ditches bad actors for a consistent impressive cast but will still rely mostly on animation which tells you a lot about it's original fan base.)",Null,0,1,17 April 1999
