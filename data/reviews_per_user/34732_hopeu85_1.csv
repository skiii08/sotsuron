Walk the Line," It was great
","Me my mom dad brother and sister all went to see the movie because I have always loved movies like great balls of fire, coalminers daughter,etc! And i know all Johnnys songs by heart. This movie was really good and i don't say this about every movie I watch either all the actors was great not just Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Phoenix, Shooter Jennings played his dad Waylon and the new actor that played Jerry Lee Lewis (WaylonPayne) was about my favorite the line he did in the movie was the best! This movie made me cry at the beginning and at the end. Even though it did not go deep into them getting old and dying it still brought a tears to my eyes! This story had a great life lesson and I think it done good by Mr.Johnny Cash and Mrs.June Carter Cash!",10,0,3,19 November 2005
