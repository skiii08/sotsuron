Changeling," Pretty good, but not Eastwood's best
","On it's face, 'Changeling' is a story well told and pretty well researched. Although based on fact, there are the obligatory 'artistic licenses' taken. Until I did some research on the actual case, I didn't realize the changes, and when I did know, it didn't seem particularly detrimental to the overall story.However, there were a lot of little nagging errors in perspective, time-line, etc. that I found annoying. Of course, my wife just rolls her eyes and tells me I'm WAY too critical in that perspective. Without trying to spoil it too bad, some of my nits were: <ul><li>At the beginning of the film, Christine &amp; Walter are discussing what happened to his father, something that only the real kid could know. Never heard about it again.</li></ul><ul><li>When she left for work the day he was kidnapped, she mentions that the neighbor would be checking in on him to make sure he was fine. Yet when she found him missing when returning home, the neighbor is never mentioned. I don't know about others, but the FIRST place I would go in that situation would be to that person to find out when (or if) she last saw the child.</li></ul><ul><li>At the end, when the boy who escaped returns home in 1935, he looks no more than 14 or 15. HOWEVER, in the flashback to 1928 during the kidnapping, the boy looks about 10 or 11, clearly one of the older boys (who were shown as being 9 or 10). Unless he was extraordinarily big for his age at 10 and didn't continue to grow, he looked all wrong.</li></ul>There were the usual goofs (Angelina Jolie sitting on one side of the street car then the next scene showing her face against the window on the OTHER side of the street car), but I found the unused clues to be sloppy film making.",7,7,13,3 November 2008
Unbreakable," Not bad, but not up to the Sixth Sense
","Maybe I was expecting too much, having seen the Sixth Sense and reading all the hype. It wasn't a terrible movie, but I wasn't as pleased with the ending as in the earlier flick.There were, I thought, three endings to the movie. Unfortunately, the director chose to show all of them!",Null,0,0,21 December 2000
Knives Out," Fun, but sometime a little too clever for itself
","The whole movie was quite good, and the premise with its odd twists and turns kept you guessing. It dragged a bit in spots, probably because they spent too much time working a twist that would be a dead end.My biggest complaint, as with movies like this, are the maddening little things that they get inconsistent. As the goofs section noted, the geography was off, and timeline on the morphine injection that the housekeeper received didn't make sense with what had been discussed earlier between Christopher Plummer and his nurse. Come to think of it, the timeline they discussed didn't make sense when the nurse gave him an overdose. And what was with Daniel Craig's accent? It had its own set of twists and turns!Okay, I do recommend it as 2 hours of inspired silliness and guessing who dunnit. And if you aren't the type like me that get frustrated by inconsistencies that don't really affect the plot, you can add a star or a star and a half to my rating.",7,3,6,10 December 2019
The Mummy," A movie in search of a genre.
","This was equal parts horror flick and a Indy Jones sendup! Though it had it's gruesome parts (the ladies hid their eyes), there were some downright hilarious bits as well. Brendan Fraser surprised me, as I perceived him as a Paulie Shore-type non-actor.",8,0,0,31 May 1999
Get Him to the Greek," 'Fat, Drunk and Stupid is no way to go through life, son'
","Apologies to the writers of 'Animal House', but Dean Wormer's comment to Flounder is just so apropos to the character(?) played by Jonah Hill.I tried to convince our friends to choose something else besides this, given all of the reviews I'd read and the trailers that I'd seen. But, someone else was paying, so I went along, figuring it couldn't be THAT bad. Well, a couple of our friends walked out within 10 minutes and saw a different movie. Wish I'd followed their lead.This movie was vulgar for the sake of being vulgar and gross for the sake of being gross. If there was supposed to be a message, it was lost in the tsunami of bodily functions, profanity, drugs and alcohol that never stopped. All in all, a waste of time and money to anyone outside the 13-25 demographic. Then again, that's where the cash must be nowadays, Hollywood keeps targeting them almost to the exclusion of the rest of us.",1,25,51,21 June 2010
Thirteen Days," Great fiction, if it wasn't true!
","It was a remarkable movie which would have been a great fiction (ala 'Failsafe') if it hadn't largely been true!High points of the movie:1) CASTING: Though they showed the names and positions of the major players, I didn't need that to identify JFK, RFK, and Robert McNamara. The guys they chose for these roles looked eerily like the real thing! I was a little fuzzy on some of the others, as I was only 7 when these events actually happened.2) REALISM: The movie didn't try to turn JFK and his team into demi-gods who single handedly stopped the Soviets, nor did they make Khruschev and the Politburo into some Empire-like meanies.Problem:ACCENTS: People have criticized Kevin Costner for his alleged Boston accent (admittedly fair to poor), but I had a lot more problem with Greenwood as JFK. Anyone who has ever heard his speeches during this time knows he always pronounced Castro's island as 'Cuber.' Yet, it was always 'Cuba' in the movie.All in all, a good movie that makes you think what might have been...",8,0,0,28 January 2001
