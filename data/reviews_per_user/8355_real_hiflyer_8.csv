"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," A n enjoyable comedy to simply sit back, relax, and enjoy.
","Why are people asking where was Hugh Grant? I mean is he the only comedic British actor they can think of? Suggesting he replace the Simon Pegg Character would be gross miscasting of the first order. Okay, this movie isn't rocket science. And sure it's predictable, how many story lines can you think of right off the bat that haven't been done to death already? Once you've accepted this as a given instead of a complaint - chill out, relax, sit back and enjoy.If I could be a fly on the wall while they were filming this movie, I'm sure there was more than one trade-off as to whether which type of humor, British or American, would crossover best. As a fan of British comedy series - Spaced being one of the best of many - I realize there is a large section of the American market that just don't get it. There's no comparing American Pie, a crass, gross, brain dead offering appealing to the basest of gross and sordid humor, to this. That type of American humor is like a punch in the face which is dummed down for the audience type it's designed for. And it sells.So okay, this wasn't a masterpiece. Neither was it a dud. It was a humorous middle of the road movie good for what it was meant for. An hour or two of light entertainment unfolding in it's own manner, in this case a pretty funny and well-paced timeout with laughs built in. I enjoyed it, and part of that enjoyment was in not faulting it for being something different than exactly what it claimed to be. Now Hot Fuzz was a hilarious tongue in cheek comedy of a different order altogether. I really can see why Americans would sit down at that movie and say huh?",7,3,6,21 February 2008
Come and See," This movie opens a tiny window into the suffering throughout the world now.
","If anything, this movie is more powerful than Schindler's List and All Quiet on the Western Front. It personalizes the trauma war brings by concentrating on one main character, a boy who plays war with his buddies and then suddenly finds himself thrown into the maelstrom of War playing him. It shows us how war traumatizes us, then hardens and changes us until cruelty becomes our own means of surviving. And germinates those first seeds of anger which reside in all of us.So this film is both timeless and universal. Like the child soldiers in Africa and other countries, like those children who even now are being raised on a diet of hate and propaganda. We are reminded here that war is horror, that the innocent usually always pay more heavily than the guilty, and without unavoidable provocation should always be seen as a last resort.It should also remind us that over 600,000 Iraqis have been killed in a war America instigated, based on lies. It's way past time that those in the administration who caused this abominable tragedy be brought to task for causing the death and suffering of both our young soldiers caught in the crossfire,and the indiscriminate killing of the innocents who live and die there now.",10,7,9,22 November 2007
3:10 to Yuma," Don't buy a ticket to Yuma before checking the refund policy
","Okay, first why steal the title from a classic western if not just to yank a few more bucks from their clients (us) when the so-called remake is butchered beyond belief. This effort should have been a standalone production just so it wouldn't drag down another production with it.The main character played by Crow is quite happy to murder law enforcement and his own gang members with nothing shorter than that of a psychopath yet fluctuates back and forth in wanting to help and feel sorry for his captor and son. I won't waste time repeating a lot of the films other irregularities, but that run through town with the citizens and gang now trying to kill them, I mean let's get real. Was it a town policy only to sell guns to blind people? And were the town people who were after the money, who knew every nook and cranny of their tiny town, just terminally stupid as well?As for the last scene - total in its absolute ridiculousness. Crow was a psychopath. Someone unable to empathize with any worth extended to others, so what's with the aw shucks I guess he's not so bad after all when he's been murdering those after him and his own gang all throughout the whole story.I could go on, but I'll leave it with this. If this is the best the studios can do with Westerns then they should forget about making them. This movie wasn't even worth the time wasted making or watching it even if you got to watch it for free. I like the main actors, I like Westerns, but the potential for quality that these things offered was absolutely absent here.",1,127,215,8 November 2007
Control," It's just a ...' 3 dressed up as a 9' ... basically a real waste of time.
","I have loved Samantha Morton since 'Leaving Liverpool', a great British mini series. She's upped the rating of whatever project she's worked ever since then. I enjoyed her rather small role in this,and unfortunately, it provided the film's only redeeming value.Now as for the rest. Curtis's movements on stage while singing were embarrassingly ... what? Stupid, retarded, laughable? The music was awful, and though occasionally some of his writing came across anyway, it was that of an averagely intelligent juvenile, what you'd expect from a high school kid. Maybe with a future in which he honed his craft, his light could have shone. He removed the chance of us ever knowing.He couldn't sing and the band's repetitive distorted insistent beat was perhaps the only reason an audience - necessarily stoned out of their minds at the time - might find it good. I'm not out of hand condemning this type of music, the Joy Division was just plain bad, but like punk-rock, death metal, and rap etc, it appeals to rebellious kids looking for something - ANYTHING - to cling to, and the more so-called truth in the lyrics consisted of distortions, filth, violence, and the degradation of women, then authority figures, then just plain hate.Some rap I like. Some does bring across the writer's experience and opens a window into a world and attitude we might not otherwise be privy to. But is the sheer deluge of outright crap you have to wade through a good enough reason for trying to find the diamonds in the rough?These forms of music seem to elevate the bad and mediocre efforts into a spotlight they could and should have never made it to. Ian Curtis comes across as being kind, but steeped in his own self indulgent importance, very little talent, and fans, as they seem to do consistently, elevate his contribution because of his committing suicide. He wasn't around long enough to fade into obscurity.If I've offended any readers, then maybe it's time you took a reality pill and wise up to the fact that most of it encourages violence, degradation of the human psyche, and intimately damages our self-esteem for ourselves, and the devaluing of the lives of others. These things do nothing to improve the plight of the poor and lower class. They teach hate and ' tell it like it is'. Don't you think people already know 'how it is', and at the risk of affecting the bottom line of the mega-bucks record company incomes, it's time to help instead of hurt?The movie was long and boring. The portrayals one dimensional. And the talent non-existent. What else do you need to know?",3,3,19,13 February 2008
There Will Be Blood," Don't believe the hype. Everything you've heard is as exaggerated as the title is misleading.
","After watching this movie, I thought Mr. Lewis did a pretty good job, and the story was fairly interesting if nothing new. That's why I am once again flabbergasted at the reaction of the critics, press, and now the awards. This is as classic and timeless as was the Western, 3:10 to Yuma. Please don't miss the sarcasm. 3:10 to Yuma was a second rate western and an insult to the original. Both the story and the performances were rote and unconvincing. There Will Be Blood was a better effort. But my God people, Rendition, Atonement, The Quiet American ... THESE are movies !!! I'm afraid it's yet another Oscar year based on some criteria I haven't been let in on. No doubt Daniel Day Lewis did a good job, but great? There was hardly enough to his character to base that opinion on. The film depicted how the oil industry began and told us that yes, the same type of mentality which drew people to the'oil-rush', are basically the same as they are now. Manipulative, controlling, and capitalistic to the point at which it's their God given duty to give little or nothing while taking all if you can, cause goshdarnit, that's the daggum American way. If that sounds harsh, do a count of the Native Americans and Mexicans in this movie. They'd been 'dealt with' thoroughly enough at this point to find it best to lurk in the background of this movie. Kind of ironic, isn't it, what with the 'immigrant problem' now. You know, when a lot of the people wanting in are those the land was stolen from in the first place.Lewis played a cold, emotionless bastard, he portrayed that without equal. But that's all he did. His character was so one dimensional that it's over two and a half hours of playing the same note perfectly, while ignoring the exploration of all those other keys. There's nothing historical to be proud of here, no nugget of information previously unknown. It was simply a character study of a controlling man who's psychosis eventually pushes him past the point of no return. With a conscience as baron as the landscape, and the sole driving force to gain more, there was no opportunity provided for an actor no matter how talented to exhibit the range of emotions a supposedly Oscar worthy performance provides the evidence for.Mr Lewis is an amazing actor who's done work of that caliber before and no doubt will do so again. There Will Be Blood, a title which still has me puzzled, just wasn't it. All of this enthusiastic praise for this project does little other than further remove the public's credibility as far as the awards are concerned, or leaves them feeling stupid for being too thick to see something that was never there in the first place.",7,12,23,27 February 2008
August Rush," Chill out, relax, and enjoy the story. Exactly the pill this doctor ordered.
","What we are really doing here is adding 'comments', as the box is titled. We're not qualified critics. We all love to think of ourselves as arm-chair critics and consider the critique we leave as Gospel. Well it ain't.When I sit down to a movie, it's not with a note book. We watch movies and read books, and listen to music to entertain ourselves. We pick the genre or style of what we experience on the premise that we like those forms, and there's a good chance of a couple of hours escape from the norm, from our own set of reality and our problems. That's a whole lot of weight to put on any form of entertainment. And all the wrong criteria for a bonified critic to work from. When we hate or love a movie we're expressing an emotion, not a critique. We're really 'commenting' on the fact that considering our mood, whatever distractions there were while watching, how far and how much help did this piece we're watching offer us in escaping our own set of problems, for a while, which let's face it exist in a world gone mad.So I watched this on my computer. My pets were fed and settled down for the night. They were either cuddled in, or asleep in their favorite places. No-one rang. (Hey - I heard someone say 'No wonder!)I watched this movie, and let it take me away. I was looking for a story, and I found one. And since all fiction is based on the premise of how far you're willing to let yourself suspend reality in order to enjoy it, my mood, or emotional criteria, I brought to watching this film was just right for there and then.So I'll comment that I loved it. The story, the people, the music, the ending, the whole fairy tale. It gave me something I needed and filled the void I'd slotted it into with a light-hearted tale of music magic and happy endings.Next time maybe I'll be criticizing this or that. But I'll try to remember what reading all these comments has reminded me of this time. That a lot of it is responding to things I disagree with that other commender's have written. This time, I'll leave it.Thanks to all involved in this picture. I truly enjoyed it and you all did a wonderful job.",8,0,1,16 March 2008
The Good Shepherd," The wolf in sheep's clothing ...
","A lot of reviewers here are drawing comparisons between The Godfather and this film. What's not pointed out often, if at all, is the closest comparison the lead characters have in common is they are both psychopathic. They both feel themselves to be above the law and both have no compunction about breaking the laws we little people try to live by, right up to and including murder. The film was well done, but I kept hoping at some stage someone would point out the movie's title was one of sheer sarcasm. However we reap what we sow. And what evil deeds justified in shadows then, we're seeing the fruits of now. The worst is that those in government committing these crimes no longer even see good reason to hide them. It left the same sensation as Lord of War did with the arms trade. The sensation of having to live in a world whose leaders have stared into the abyss for so long they now mirror its reflection.",8,0,0,3 January 2008
Atonement," A love story with more than the ravages of war to contend with.
","This was a very good movie, but for reasons not normally listed here. To me I focused on the moral aspect, and the devastation which can be caused by its aftermath. I believe the girl suffered regret from when the realization struck home as the police drove the accused away. But instead of going the full distance to put things right, she worked at a job her 'society' posing would have let her bypass, and perhaps tried to make things right with herself more so than with the others.So the moral of the story? We all know that as we grow older a heartbeat can be enough time to take us from here to where death will take us. If we've done wrong, and it has and is hurting others, then the time to put things right is now. And the reason no better than it is simply the right thing to do. Forgiveness may be forthcoming, but it's got to be by-product of the process, not the reason.I enjoyed the movie, but I like mostly how it reminded me of what the wages of sin carries, and how that weight is sometimes careless upon whom it chooses to bear its burden.i think the young couple suffered greatly",8,1,1,25 December 2007
