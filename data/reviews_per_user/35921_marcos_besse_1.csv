It," A teen movie: the marketing has made it bigger than it really is
","I'm a great fan of horror movies and I was surprised when 'It' broke The Exorcist's box office record. For some reason, I was able to watch it only a couple of week after its release and had big expectations. Unfortunately, I left the movie theater frustrated. The script was too infantile and the scary scenes were boring. Annabelle and The Conjuring brought the current horror movies to the another level and 'It' just followed some old rules. I don't want to write spoilers but there is an important thing to say: all the children suffered prejudice but nothing compared to the fat boy. He's the one who most suffered it, in different moments of the story. It doesn't help to diminishes the prejudice against chubby kids. That could have been avoided.",6,1,3,29 September 2017
