The Lobster," A Bleak View
","I'm not usually a fan of dystopian films, but this one reminded me more of 1984 than anything else I've seen. I was drawn in right from the beginning, and for a good while, I was happily along for the ride. There was an offbeat sense of humor that I appreciated. However, I felt like it lost focus and went in a direction it didn't need to go to make its point. My interest started to wane as the movie went on and I saw where it was going. What was fun about the early sequences is you start to learn the rules of this world bit by bit as it unfolds. If this movie is commenting on the need for approval to be a couple in today's society, it sure meandered a lot to get there.",4,2,3,25 February 2017
The Avengers," Best Superhero Movie
","This movie was good all the way through. When I first saw the trailers for Thor and Captain America, I didn't think the actors looked like they fit the parts. This movie has the advantage of coming out after we've already had time to see the individual movies, learn the origin stories, and get used to the actors and costumes. I still didn't think Chris Evans was a good choice, but by this point, I can look past it. It had to be really hard to find a way to make a character as unremarkable as Loki into a villain worthy of being the main antagonist, but I ended up really enjoying Hiddleston's performance. He might be one of those performers that I like watching in anything he does. The movie was long enough to feel appropriately epic, but never dragging. The visuals were all great, especially the technology. This movie, The Amazing Spiderman, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes all have science labs that look like they were designed by the same team, with lots of blue holograms and transparent screens. I hope everyone who worked on this one can all get it together for at least one more Avengers movie, because this one was really fun.",9,2,6,26 May 2013
Black Swan," I have to include spoilers to talk about this movie
","Watching the first hour of this movie, I was very much drawn into this story and couldn't wait to see how it resolved. Natalie Portman was fun to watch as a delicate young girl working herself to death to be a perfect ballerina. The conflict came from the director of her company, who pushed her to play a dual role that required her to take on a dark, seductive mindset. We see that her character, Nina, still lives with her mother, who has coddled and protect her, not allowing her to be exposed to aspects of life that would give her any experience at being dark or messy. Then, we meet Lily, Nina's polar opposite: impulsive, liberated, sexual. She is as uninhibited as Nina is controlled. The story teases that Lily will help Nina open up, and starts to move that way. Where I became frustrated was in the second half of the movie. Nina has more and more things happen to her that we think will finally allow her to dance the black swan as her director wants: as a sexual, seductive temptress. But after each event--flirtations from the director, a night on the town with Lily, standing up to her mom--she remains cold and mousy. In the final moments of the nearly two hour film, we finally get the climactic release we deserve, as Nina fully becomes the black swan and goes to a new place through her dance. However, by this point she has descended almost completely into madness, having so many hallucinations and dream sequences, that the audience can't be sure that any of what they have seen has been real.My opinion of this movie is that I would have enjoyed it more without the mental illness. It didn't really interest me to see Nina go crazy and destroy herself as a result of the pressure to perform. I am not a fan of stories that have characters lose their minds to take the story where it has to go. If it had been written so that she somehow became a victim of her own ambition, I would have found it more interesting. When a movie does what this one did and fills its running time with dream sequences and hallucinations, it feels to me like a cheat. I'm watching things that aren't real in the world of the characters I am trying to place myself in.Some reviewers have suggested that parts of this movie are open to interpretation, but I think the final scene in which Nina sees the stage lights become a single bright haze must surely mean that she passed on, presumably from self-injury during one of her spells. I compare this to the ending of the horror movie May, which did roughly the same thing, but made more sense to me. The lead character injured herself severely enough to bleed to death, but didn't start hallucinating until she was beginning to fade. It made her characters choices more valid, because she was acting on her own motivations until that point, and not responding to imaginary occurrences.I did enjoy those final moments when Nina danced the black swan and seemed to really go off the deep end. It was the thrilling climax I had been waiting for, but didn't give me as much satisfaction as I felt it would. As I said, I felt the movie got a little off track--it build up my expectations, and when I thought I was ready for the climax, it kind of deflated my interest a bit, causing me to not be as emotionally invested as I might have had the story been a little tighter. Overall, I thought most aspects of the movie were done very well, and it was certainly an exciting piece of flimmaking, but for me, not the classic it might have been.",6,1,5,28 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Pirates number 4
","On Stranger Tides is not as well written as the first of the series. I did like some of the settings, such as the tavern where Jack talks to his father. I enjoy seeing the recreations of the time period. The dialog was good enough to keep things interesting. The mermaid attack was done in a very threatening way, although it doesn't feel as epic as the giant squid. There were a few things that weren't really explained that left me unsatisfied, like the ship in the bottle, and the relationship between the clergyman and the mermaid. Johnny Depp is still fun as Jack Sparrow. As long as the rest of the series is good enough, he will be remembered as one of the greatest movie characters ever.",6,0,0,2 September 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Least Interesting MCU Film
","I thought this was the weakest of the Marvel films. I don't expect I would even take the time to watch it again. I didn't like Ed Norton as Banner, and now that we've seen Mark Ruffalo in the role, this film seems even more obsolete. I didn't care much about the story--they stuck with the most basic, commonly told Hulk storyline, yet it was done in a way that I don't think it would play well to younger viewers. I didn't much care for William Hurt or Tim Roth either, and that goes for their performances as well as what's in the script. I almost liked Liv Tyler as Betty, since she had some scenes where she got to show some strength of spirit. There were some technical aspects that were well done also, the most impressive being the overhead shots of the Brazilian slums. I had to look up whether or not this was a real place because the movie made it look so incredible. The abomination looked terrible, and the ending fight in Toronto (actual filming location) was pretty lame. And yet, there were so many inside references to the history of the character that you have to assume the filmmakers wanted to do him justice. Supposedly the principal actors were big Hulk fans too. Somehow, it just didn't work.",5,0,2,3 May 2015
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Coming of Age Drama
","This movie is about a character named Charlie, who seems to be based on the author of the novel it's based on. It details his freshman year in high school and how his personal issues add to the difficulty of fitting in. He makes friends with some older kids and starts to feel like he belongs. For about 45 minutes, the movie seemed to build very well. Emma Watson's character, Sam, is established as the love interest that is not yet attainable. Emma's performance, along with the script, portray her as the kind of girlfriend who could also be your best friend. The focus seems to be on her importance to the main character. During this time, it feels like the film is giving Watson the chance to show that she can carry a film as its main star. Towards the end, however, we see more of Charlie dealing with his depression and sexual abuse, and the interesting group of friends all go off to college. Then the movie ends. I wasn't sure what to take away from this; just when we were going to find out what kind of relationship Charlie and Sam would now have, they are separated, and then the story finishes. Ezra Miller is probably the one who will benefit the most from being in this movie, because he is very memorable. I will definitely look forward to whatever Emma does next, because I enjoyed her in this movie, but it felt like her arc got cut short. Five out of ten.",5,1,3,5 January 2013
Skyfall," Above Average
","Skyfall was the first Bond movie I have seen in a LONG time. The main draw of the series is that men want to be him, and I don't really end up doing that. But this episode was fun to watch anyway. First, because of the quality of the visuals. The title sequence and the scenes in Scotland looked great. Second, I appreciated how they took every opportunity to do things differently from how they would have been handled in an older Bond movie. Q doesn't have any gadgets, the villain isn't trying to take over the world, Bond isn't invincible, and the female lead plays a much different role. Javier Bardeem's villain is different enough from other bad guys to make him interesting, although he can't really compete with Anton Chigrgh. The scene when he takes out his dentures was very memorable. The story is that he was an ex-agent who was sold up the river by M, and he has spent his life building an empire to plan his moment of revenge. He's a computer expert, so he can hack anything and cause any trouble he wants. He gets captured so he can get access to M, and Bond fights him off to end the second act of the movie and set up the final sequence. Then came the part I really admired: Bond, M, and an elderly gamekeeper rig an old Scottish mansion to hold off a gang of villains. They are coming to kill M. I thought the relatively small stakes was much more interesting to watch than the usual save-the-world action sequence. The movie felt overlong, so that by the end, it had lost some tension. But overall, it was entertaining, one that I would be willing to watch again some day.",7,2,10,23 November 2012
Iron Man 3," I hope this series never ends
","I thought this movie was a lot of fun, and I may have enjoyed it even more than the first two. The two big criticisms I see people making about it are that the Mandarin wasn't the same as in the comics, and that Tony didn't use the armor much. I consider the Mandarin to be a boring villain in the first place. The comedy was worth not having an iconic super villain. As far as not using the armor enough, I did want to see more of Iron Man tearing stuff apart. But again, I liked what we got in place of it so much, it was an agreeable trade off. Seeing how resourceful Tony can be with none of his technology was just as fun, and the stuff with the kid was full of great humor. Guy Pearce's sleazy bad guy in a suit wasn't nearly as much fun as Justin Hammer from #2--I would have rather had him back. The after-credits scene legitimately had me worried--I want to imagine Tony and Banner are hanging out. I don't like the idea that they might not be getting along! Even all the other problems people point out about plot holes and character inconsistencies don't really diminish how much I enjoyed IM3. I thought the script was incredible and I was constantly surprised at how inventive it was. RD jr. created a character for the ages with his take on Tony, but with this installment, I now feel this character and this movie series may be among my personal favorites. This movie is just too smart to be a big summer action kids movie, but it had its cake and ate it too: well made and impossibly successful. Good for them. I want more.2019 Update: Oh well..",8,29,39,9 August 2014
The Ring," Had To Close My Eyes
","This is one of my favorite horror movies, not because I enjoy watching it back over and over, but because of how much I enjoyed it when I saw it in the theater. It was so freaky, I had to close my eyes at one point. I think Gore Verbinski is a really good director, and I wish he did more like this. Watching it back again recently, I realized the story doesn't really hold up. It's mostly the atmosphere and the scares that work. As horror movies go, it was one of the most effective I've seen.",7,0,0,15 February 2020
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Holds Up To Repeated Viewings
","I always considered this one of Disney's lesser efforts, with Cruella DeVil being it's saving grace. One of the great movie villains of all time, she seemed to be the life of this story. However, after my two year old daughter became obsessed with several scenes, I found that I was able, after watching it over and over, to appreciate many of the little details.101 Dalmatians is the story of a family of puppies who are kidnapped by an evil fur-loving heiress who wants to make them into a coat. It's a fairly simple story, and not everything about it is entirely novel. The climactic car chase, for example, doesn't really have much to it when you break it down. Most of the characters are pretty bland, in contrast to the outrageous Cruella.Yet, I find myself appreciating these attributes, having grown tired of every children's movie since Aladdin showcasing at least one smart-alec, pop-culture referencing sidekick to plant the story firmly in the age of irony. It is refreshing to return to a time when we didn't have Eddie Murphy or Nathan Lane doing hyperactive voice-overs filled with in-jokes meant for the adults.In addition, I like the visual style, which other reviewers noted came about through a process meant to finish the film more cheaply, and which would be used for nearly twenty years of Disney movies. I especially enjoy the detail in the London street scenes, but I also like to watch the way the characters move, at times almost breaking out of the two-dimensional plane. Watch as Anita tries to walk around Roger while he is singing about Cruella. He jumps to the side to block her, and you feel the depth of the room better than you expect you could. There are also some great facial expressions (my favorite being the exasperated Anita as Roger descends the staircase at the reprise of 'Cruella DeVil'). Throw in a couple hidden references (some characters from Lady and The Tramp and some older Disney cartoons), along with a score that's fun to whistle, and I find that I don't really mind watching this one over and over. The animated sequel, 101 Dalmatians part 2, offers some laughs for fans of the original by bringing back some of the little details, such as showing Cruella's reconstructed car, and employing Thunderbolt and Kanine Krunchies as plot devices. However, comparing the new movie with the original, you can see how much has changed in the expectations for family entertainment. I get the idea that as long as movies are animated and don't contain anything outright offense, there will be people who praise it as decent children's viewing. Disney deserved his success because of the care he put into his movies--not just the look, but the story, the feel, the characters, what audiences would take from it. (For a jaw-dropping example of just how much thought went into a story, listen to one of the extras on the Bambi DVD where you 'listen in' on some of the planning sessions Disney had with his creative teams). Pixar seems to be the only ones doing anything that comes close to this today. That's why they deserve their success, too.",7,1,1,26 July 2009
In Bruges," Fun While It Lasted
","I think my expectations were built up too high for this movie--I kept hearing how amazing it was. It's a fine story with some great lines of well written humor, but it felt a bit like a Pulp Fiction wannabe. I think the biggest weakness is the ending. Having everyone just die isn't much of a resolution. It makes we wonder why I invested the time following these characters for the last hour and a half. Everyone in the movie did a great job. I liked Mad Eye Moody as Ken, even though I didn't buy him as a killer for hire. Ralph Fiennes gets to be the crazy crime boss, like the one in Sexy Beast, and he does it stylishly. Colin Farrell carried the lead just fine. I would have liked to have something to take away from my viewing rather than just have the movie stop, but it was fun while it lasted.",7,0,0,4 March 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Blew me away
","I had the idea going in that Rogue One was a small side story, a footnote in the Star Wars saga. It turned out to be epic in scale, building up to the amazing climax. The story fits in perfectly with Episode IV, and is likely to please most fans of the original trilogy. There were a lot of characters and places that are new to this film, so that it doesn't feel to similar to the other ones. Still, it's familiar enough that you could believe all these events had really happened during their place in the timeline. One disappointment was the character of Gran Moff Tarkin. One of my favorites from the first film, I didn't think we had any memorable lines or moments from him. For the work they must have done to create the performance, I'd hoped they'd use him better.",9,1,5,5 February 2017
Captain Marvel," Least favorite Marvel movie
","This movie didn't entertain me in any way. I went to the theater to see it because I thought it would have important story points leading into the next film. It was completely unnecessary. I wanted to like Captain Marvel, but there was nothing I found likable about her or this story.",4,4,8,19 November 2019
This Is the End," One Word: McBride
","This is one of my favorite comedies. I enjoy it all the way through. The plot is that some friends get trapped in a house during the Apocalypse, but they are all celebrities. Nearly everyone who shows up in this movie is willing to make fun of themselves, some of them in really nasty ways. What really makes this movie for me is Danny McBride. He's kind of playing Kenny Powers here, but that's fine with me. They give him an epic entrance and a great send off, and that's what more movies need to do: show respect to McBride. Treasure him, showcase him, for he is unto us the most hilarious performer working today. But I'm going to say it again, I enjoy every moment of the movie, right up to the satisfying final scene. Worth owning.",9,3,4,22 April 2017
Iron Man 2," Fun Movie
","The Iron Man movies are still all about RDJ. What he's done with Tony Stark is comparable to what Johnny Depp did with Jack Sparrow: he's made an iconic character for the ages entirely out of his unique performance. It would be nice if this sequel had some interesting character development and smart plotting, but it didn't really matter much. It looked good, there were great performances, and the writing was adequate enough. It ended up being pretty fun. Justin Hammer is a villain you hope to see again. Whiplash deserved better; they should have made changes to the script once they realized what Mickey was on to. I liked the story with Tony finding a new battery for his heart light. I liked the Black Widow fight scene. Good action and good humor--better than I expected.",6,2,7,20 July 2014
The Hunger Games," Winter's Bone, directed by Debra Granik
","I thought this was an entertaining movie on the first viewing. It got me interested enough to read the books, which were pretty addictive on their own. I don't think either this movie or the books have much repeat watch/read value for me. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was a good choice, but she was more effective in Winter's Bone. In that movie, she played a similar character with similar motivations--a girl from a poor family struggling for her survival. But after I read the third book, it negated much of the admiration I had for the character, whereas in Winter's Bone, when the movie ended, I really felt like the character had accomplished something. So skip this movie and the whole Hunger Games trilogy and just go see Winter's Bone.",6,0,3,29 September 2012
Zootopia," Well Developed Story and Characters
","The people developing stories for Disney films have got it down to a science. Zootopia opens with a sequence designed to make you love its heroine right from the beginning and moves through the beats of the hero's journey so dexterously, it's over before you realize how it happened. Like Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph, it differs from the traditional content of Disney classics, taking us on an emotional journey through a completely unique sort of world rather than one from European fairy tales. The setting and characters are strong points--much of the comedy comes from the viewer's understanding of Judy and Nick's personalities rather than setting up and paying off gags. The plot is more like the complicated, twisting scripts we usually get from Pixar films, and like the best Pixar movies, everything ties together and fits logically (BH6 and WIR were able to do that notably well, also). There isn't a strong, memorable villain, but it probably didn't need one with two lead characters as likable as Judy and Nick. There weren't many songs, and it might not have a prince and princess, but I expect people will want to visit Zootopia again and again.",9,3,13,6 March 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Perfect
","I recently re-watched this movie after probably ten years of not having seen any of it. I had thought maybe I was over it, that its appeal had diminished with time. I was wrong.This movie is so well done, it defines 'timeless.' I don't necessarily love every moment--I can do without the drippy title song--but it is done at such a high standard, I can't really fault it. I asked myself if I had even one thing to criticize. Even though some of the songs aren't my taste, I can't complain.I think the main thing that always draws me back in are the three main characters. I like how the Beast is allowed to be angry, screaming at people--I like seeing that abandon in a Disney movie. Belle somehow wins me over every time. I had gotten to used to seeing her face on endless mountains of merchandise that I forgot how fresh and different she is when you see her in action. And Gaston, I think, has the best lines of any Disney villain. He was the character that made me decide, for a number of years, that this was my favorite Disney movie.Like the best animated films, there are moments that just make you enjoy watching the visuals. Little things like the way Belle kicks over a bucket of corn to feed her chickens.I don't really have any more to say, except this is pretty much perfect.",10,0,2,13 March 2011
The Babadook," Fun To Interpret
","This was a movie that I thought about quite a bit after having watched it. As an allegory, it seemed evident fairly early on what was causing the problems for this family. Amelia is a widower struggling to raise her 7 year old son, Sam, when a supernatural presence begins to torment them. We are shown that Amelia has clearly not dealt with the loss of her husband and that along with the grief, Sam's behavior is beginning to wear on her. We can see her slowly losing control and her mental health deteriorating, and so it is an easy leap to make that the paranormal happenings are related to her mindset. My interpretation differs slightly from what I have read in many other discussion of the movie. I think the Babadook is not an actual creature, but something representing the emotional baggage Amelia carries in her subconscious. Throughout the movie, I kept expecting her to deal with these buried emotions in a healthy way and remove the threat completely. I was looking forward to this moment and see how the filmmaker would choose to represent it. What actually happens it kind of confusing as far as what it seems to say about how the director feels we deal with our issues. The actual moment when Amelia defeats the Babadook consists of her telling it that it is nothing, it doesn't belong in her house, and then screaming. The aftermath is that she seems to have control of the creature, which I think is meant to suggest she is dealing with her pain but that it still remains somewhere within her. There are ways that people can deal with and release buried emotions and pain, and I felt that not demonstrating this in a clearer way was a lost opportunity. Some other thoughts: this is a movie layered with symbolism, and there was clearly a lot of thought put into everything said and shown. That said, I don't think everything works or represents what it is meant to represent clearly, but it was thought provoking nonetheless. Also, the performances are striking. The young boy does some things that I don't think a child actor has ever done before, and it was incredible what they got out of him. Essie Davis has such a wrenching performance that it's hard to watch at times--she really goes through the ringer. Finally, I don't know that I would have appreciated this movie as much when I was younger. I think it is more effective for people who have started to become aware how our experiences affect us over time and how our subconscious actually works. I'm glad I saw this, even if I disagree with what it says about the inner workings of our minds.",8,2,7,9 January 2015
Us," Unique horror story
","Us gets points for originality--I don't think there is anything else quite like it out there, so I enjoyed that they came up with some new stuff. The first half of the movie builds well, as I was all in, waiting to see where it would go. I loses a little steam in the second half, where it gets to be more like a 'survive the apocalypse' film, but when I didn't know what was going on, it was nice. Lupita was very creepy, and there were some supporting players that added to the enjoyment (I'm thinking of Tim Heideker). I wasn't bothered by the plot holes or unexplained mechanics of how this world would be possible. I just went along for the ride. Don't watch if you need all your plot threads neatly tied into a logical finished product.",7,0,2,14 September 2019
Us," Little girl.....run!
","So I enjoyed this as a creepy little thriller. I'm not going to let all the plot holes and unanswered questions influence this review. I just went along with it, and that worked for me. There was enough of the story that worked that I was able to overlook things like odd tonal shifts and improbable explanations. I would even say I enjoyed this more than Get Out, largely because I find the premise much more interesting. Red was spooky for sure, and there is something to enjoy about each of the performances. I'm glad I was able to not take it too seriously, though, and had some fun with it.",7,0,3,30 July 2019
Ted," Funny all the way through
","I've been in the mood for R-rated comedies lately, and I've been lucky to find a string of them that I've all enjoyed. Ted was one of the better ones in that it didn't totally deflate in the final act, although it did start to feel clichéd and conventional. The early scenes are funny as John and Ted have to grow up and get separate lives. Ted getting the job at the grocery store might be my favorite bits. Mark Wahlberg's character gets dangerously close to unlikable--I liked it better when he was playing it straight as opposed to trying to make his girlfriend laugh by acting like he was twelve. I know that was the point, but I thought they showed it better through his lack of ambition than his childish humor. The subplot with the kidnapper and his kid doesn't pay off except for the scenes in their home. The chase at the end and the wrap up had some good lines by Ted, but felt too much like a thousand other movies to be interesting. Ted himself looked amazing-- as accomplished as anything in CG or animation. However, I found myself really wishing someone else had done the voice. It was distracting that he sounded so much like another well known character. I think he needed his own unique sound, but that seems to be less of a problem as I rewatch it over. I would definitely check out a Ted part 2. I don't know Ted's lines were all in the script or if the voice actor did a lot of improvising, but his dialog was the highlight and what kept the whole thing together. Also, I'd like to see Joel McHale as this sleazy villain in every movie from now on. 6 out of 10.",6,0,2,31 August 2013
The Irishman," Hard to follow
","This movie moved fast and packed in a lot of details that I couldn't follow. Whereas other Scorsese movies explain the context of events, this one doesn't seem to care if you get it or not. There is narration, and characters do explain what's going on, but I couldn't keep up, especially in the first hour. I think I would need to watch it a few times to appreciate more of the story, and I'm not sure I'm willing to do that.",8,4,14,1 December 2019
Hot Fuzz," Skip It
","After Sean of the Dead, there were many of us excited to hear that Simon Pegg and Nick Frost had done another feature with their brand of humor. I thought part of Sean's charm was it low-key simplicity. Here, we take a fine concept, a successful London cop assigned to a sleepy country town, and blow it into a full-on action movie. There are still lots of funny moments, and Bill Nighy is pure gold for the 2.398 minutes of screen time he gets. However, it ended up feeling very by-the-numbers by the end, with all the plot reveals, chase sequences, and tidy resolutions. He may as well have gone Hollywood--there are so many generic moments that they cancel out the original ideas. Why put in the effort and waste your talent on something that's been done so many times as the buddy cop format? Then again, I've heard some bad things about the Simon Pegg movie that came out after this one, so maybe he had already used up all his good ideas when he finished Sean.",4,1,5,21 December 2009
L.A. Confidential," My All Time Favorite
","I love everything about this movie. It's one of the most transporting films I've ever seen, and I watch it back endlessly. All I can really say is that I recommend it, but you should understand that it is a complex story that may require several viewings. I remember seeing the t.v. ad for this movie and thinking it looked really pedestrian. Then, I saw a clip and liked it enough to give it a chance. When I watch this movie, I absorb it like rays from the sun. It is the best ever.",10,3,4,22 January 2020
The Jungle Book," Lifelong Favorite
","Since I was a little kid, the Jungle Book has always been one of my favorites. I have an affection for this movie that only deepens with time, and now I am able to share it with my daughter. It is pure joy captured on film.Maybe it's not a perfect movie, but I love so many things about it: the characters, the setting, the music, and the animation. It looks even better now with DVD restorations with eye-popping colors and beautifully done backgrounds.For me, the heart of the film is the character of Baloo. As a big Disney fan, I would probably pick him if forced to choose my favorite character. His relationship with Mowgli is some kind of cross between a big brother, a playmate, and a surrogate father. I know that when I was a preschooler, I wanted nothing more than to hang out with Baloo.I could never write an objective review for The Jungle Book. I've loved it all my life. The Disney team has given us a timeless gift in this film.",8,1,3,26 February 2010
Midnight in Paris," One of the Best Looking Movies Ever
","I think this might be the easiest of Woody's movies to follow, and maybe the most entertaining. If you're not generally a fan of his brand of filmmaking, you might still enjoy this one. The movie starts out following the lives of a couple vacationing in Paris, Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams. They are engaged, but her parents aren't very approving, and Owen doesn't really fit in with her friends either. Everyone does a great job of being extremely unlikable, which makes it easy for the audience to side with odd man out Wilson. He eventually breaks free when he takes walk and gets transported to the past where he meets and parties with historical figures. Wilson's enthusiasm and timing are what made these scenes fun for me--he is so excited to be hanging out with Cole Porter and Zelda Fitzgerald. I was hoping Tom Hiddleston would be one of the highlights, but he isn't given much to do. Instead, the guy playing Hemingway totally steals it, and the rest of the movie doesn't have anything as awesome as his scenes. Except for the cinematography, which will make Paris look like the most amazing city on earth. Wilson eventually comes to understand that he doesn't want to live in the past, and that there are people from every generation who romanticize the time period before theirs. He embraces life and breaks up with McAdams' shrew, a much more evil character than the one she played in a movie that promised 'Mean Girls' in its title. Although there were only a few scenes where the dialog was at its best, I am sure I will watch this movie again just for the incredible shots of the scenery.

The Hateful Eight," Can't Put My Finger On What's Wrong
","This is the first Tarantino movie that has failed to entertain me in any way. I enjoyed the snowy Wyoming scenery, but that was it. I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. If some of his other films were uneven, there were at least scenes that I enjoyed watching back, and I always appreciated his unique dialog. I could complain about the fact that it took place almost entirely in one room, but Reservoir Dogs used a similar narrative device and it is infinitely watchable. I can think of similar films, like The Master or Glengarry Glenross, in which the point is more about the dialog and performances than how the story resolves, and I almost always enjoy these movies. I can't really say why I didn't feel anything watching Hateful Eight--given the talent involved, I should be enjoying it as much as other viewers seem to. For whatever reason, it just left me completely disinterested.",3,104,219,21 December 2015
Moana," Fine Family Film
","I enjoyed this movie and will certainly watch it back from time to time. I may even end up owning it. But it is the first animated Disney movie since Tangled I haven't been in a hurry to watch back. The only sequence that I enjoyed on the same level was the crab, with his song 'Shiny.' It may be my favorite Disney song since I was a child. But I can't tell you any specific problems with this film. It may be the best looking animated film ever made, as the ocean and island scenery was spectacular. It just didn't capture my imagination the way Big Hero 6 or Wreck It Ralph did. There characters were memorable and well designed, and I was excited to hear it was going to have a Polynesian setting. But somewhere the story was just lacking. It didn't feel as well developed as the other recent films, almost like it went into production without the extra revisions it needed. Even so, I expect it will be loved by generations of viewers, so I'll give it a 7 out of 10.",7,0,4,25 February 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fine
",This was fine. I wasn't that into it except for the relationship (that ended up going nowhere) and the Tony Stark scenes. Vulture held no interest for me as a villain.,6,0,0,19 November 2019
Pan's Labyrinth," Wasn't that into it
","I had high expectations for this movie. It was impressive as far as the work that went into it, but I didn't enjoy the story that much. I liked the symbolism and I appreciated the fact that everything had a purpose-- every visual, every line of dialog had something to do with the theme. One analysis I've read suggested that Ophelia, by clinging to her books and fantasy world represents a need or appreciation for stories, which is 'human,' and that the dad is 'inhuman' because he only cares about routines, procedures, and the passing of time. The creatures were great to look at, and there were many moments that I enjoyed, but I don't think I'll watch it again.",5,2,4,19 June 2013
Horrible Bosses," Well Directed R-rated Comedy
","I liked Horrible Bosses. I thought it was well written all the way through. I enjoyed the offbeat humor, and there was no down time--it kept going right to the end. I liked all the performances except for maybe Colin Farrell--wasn't sure what they were going for with his character, but didn't get any good lines or memorable moments. It was fun seeing Jennifer Anniston play the aggressor. I've begun to trust that a comedy with Jason Bateman or Jason Sudeikis will be worth my while based on how well they've chosen their roles. Well directed.",7,0,0,19 April 2017
Suicide Squad," Lots of Problems
","I'm not going to try to defend this movie in any way. It has plenty of problems, so much that viewers can see the cracks behind the curtains: it's become famous for its poor editing and all the scenes that were cut. I agree with all the criticisms and some of them do bother me. But on the whole, I ended up enjoying this movie. Not totally sure why, because I haven't cared about any of the other DC movies lately, but I just did. Will Smith's performance is grating, the lack of Joker is frustrating, and there are plenty of moments that make no sense, but I enjoy watching back anyway.",7,0,1,25 February 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Incredibly High Level of Achievement
","It was striking how well made Winter Soldier is. I was really impressed with how much work went into this movie. The story plays out like a spy thriller, in a similar vein to Manchurian Candidate, but also fits in as much action as any movie could hope for. It's very well balanced, and includes the character development and smart writing that have made the Marvel movies so enjoyable. Captain America goes rogue when he is a suspect in the shooting of Nick Fury and has to unravel who has infiltrated S.H.E.I.L.D. Black Widow and Falcon help him out, and they are both made to be very resourceful on their own. I like Johansson here better than the Avengers--she seems to be putting more into the performance. I noticed that Captain America doesn't really use stealth in combat--when he fights, he goes through the threat in spite of what he's up against. There's a scene when a jet is trying to stop him while riding a motorcycle. Instead of jumping the bike to somewhere the jet can't follow, he engages and disables it. The Winter Soldier villain does this also, taking out Nick Fury in spite of his training, not going around any defenses. All the fights were lightning fast and had a level of interest to them where so many other action movies are full of scenes that never make us care. This isn't my favorite action movie, not even my favorite Avengers movie, but it was one of the times I've most been impressed by an action film.",7,5,10,1 June 2014
Tangled," IMO: Best Animated Movie in nearly 20 years
","This is probably the best animated film since Finding Nemo, and I would say the best Disney movie since Aladdin. They really hit it out of the park with this one. It'a simple story, but the characters make it lots of fun to watch. Of course, the animation is incredible, both in how detailed and appealing, but also the style of design. I especially like the storybook settings like the Snuggly Duckling and the streets of the kingdom. The songs are fine, although I don't see the soundtrack as being one of the strong points. Rapunzel and Flynn are the main reason to watch, and supporting characters like Maximus and Mother Gothel add a lot as well. As a villain, Mother Gothel is one of the more complicated Disney characters; she's clearly evil, but at the same time, acts as a mother for Rapunzel. When the movie was over, I had some confusion about her motivations, which makes me wonder if younger viewers will be clear about her either.",9,2,5,24 April 2011
Doctor Strange," Marvel Triumphs AGAIN
","I was never able to finish an issue of a Dr. Strange comic. I would have bet anything that even Marvel Studios would fail at trying to make this character interesting. Turns out, it was a huge hit, and now that I've seen it, I would rank it as one of the more entertaining comic book movies. The visuals were absolutely eye popping, but the story had me 100% invested in seeing how it would turn out. It's also one of the fastest paced movies I've ever seen, moving along at breakneck speed for the first half. It has great action, an interesting main character, and I even like the subject matter, particularly the idea that there are things we don't see all around us unless we can expand our minds. This movie does what all movies ought to aim to do.",8,4,5,22 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Wrap It Up
","I was pleased with the final film of this saga. Having grown up with the original trilogy, I was initially a Star Wars fan through and through. The prequels kind of killed my love for the franchise, and the new sequels have been up and down. So I came into this episode with caution, not expecting to be blown away. I enjoyed it. I didn't see anything really wrong with how things were handled, except for anything involving Leia. That was painfully bad. I thought it was interesting that this movie had to invent an all new plot, since there wasn't much left hanging from episode 8. I don't know if I will enjoy watching it back, but it had some great moments--enough to get me through to the end.",8,2,8,21 December 2019
Pacific Rim," Big and Dumb
","I didn't dislike this movie; giant robots against giant monsters is a fun idea that isn't like anything else being done right now. But the dialog needed to be smarter. I think there is more going on with the characters than I picked up from one viewing--I gotta believe Del Toro put in some layers you have to dig for. But on the surface, it comes off like some of the sillier action movies of the early 80's. Some notes for the sequel: 1. Hire a writer that speaks the language the film gets made in; 2. Get someone in there that understands color design--maybe you could sell some toys if everything wasn't all the same shade of blue-gray; 3. Don't bother having the giant robots throw the giant monsters when they're fighting in water. It doesn't hurt. Show more damage. It's cool when body parts break off. Kthnx, j.g.",7,6,8,13 November 2013
Corpse Bride," Amazing Visuals
","Although you may read that it's based on a 19th century folk tale, The Corpse Bride is 100% a Tim Burton creation. Just check IMDb's recommendations--the only other movies considered to be similar are by Burton. The animation is incredible, although I didn't care much for the design of most of the characters. The exception is the bride herself, Emily. Likewise, the music was extremely well done, although I wasn't into it--the songs were just sort of there for me. All the technical aspects such as lighting, composition, etc, were off the charts. But while I enjoyed looking at all the details, I wasn't really drawn into the story--except, again, for Emily. The ending is very sweet, but just sort of happens. Unlike The Nightmare Before Christmas, where the movie builds to Jack and Sally being together, I didn't feel Emily's liberation was earned. I wanted a little something more from this movie--I just didn't feel the story added up. I'll give it an 8 out of 10 because of how well made it is in nearly every aspect, even though my own impression is that it falls a little short of what it could have been.",8,0,0,15 November 2014
Watchmen," I enjoyed it.
","Watchmen is another comic book movie. The book it is based on, published in the mid-80's, was one of the biggest reasons that comics became more mature and mainstream. Today, every comic character seems to be a hot property for film adaptations, and the movies being made from this genre are getting more and more sophisticated. Watchmen was directly responsible for the beginning of this trend. The comic was written more for adults than kids, so this ends up being rated 'R.' Anyone trying to decide whether or not to watch--or let their kids watch it--should know it is what they call a 'hard R,' which means that there is a lot of stuff going all through the movie that contributes to that rating: language, violence, nudity, and mature situations. I took my wife, not really expecting her to like it much, especially since she doesn't really enjoy gory violence. Her comment, watching what she assumed was a superhero movie, was 'I don't see any heroes.'I'm not usually big on gore either, but one of the things I enjoyed most was the savagery of the character Rorshach. Chopping heads, frying faces, taking on groups of cops alone--you just want to watch this guy go nuts. Maybe there should never be a sequel, but it's impossible not to want to see more of Rorshach. I enjoyed most of the choices in this movie. The opening credits were especially rewarding with all the blink-and-you'll-miss-it cultural references. A couple things that did bother me: Carla Guigino (who I usually like) and Matt Frewer were TERRIBLE. Their acting belonged in a bad soap opera. And some of the makeup was poorly done. Carla, again, as an elderly woman worked about as well as the Wayans' in White Chicks. Matt Frewer looked more like something out of Narnia. And the guy playing Nixon was the most cartoonish. Also, a lot of the pop songs chosen for this movie have been overused in other soundtracks. The one that worked best was 'The Times They Are-A Changin.' What they did with that song gave it a whole new meaning. But 'Sounds of Silence' and 'All Along The Watchtower' felt like clichés.The other choice that will have fans divided is the ending. In the book, a giant monster destroys New York. In the movie, we are told that several cities were bombed. I would have rather seen the monster.Watchmen might be one of the most faithful scripts in any movie ever adapted from a book. It went a little long, some of the casting was off, and some of the costumes weren't that good, but I liked it enough to watch it again.",6,0,2,8 March 2009
Hot Rod," Entertaining Comedy
","I watched this movie a couple months ago. I feel like I've forgotten most of it; however, I did enjoy the cast, especially Ian McShane. His scenes were worth watching this movie for. The rest of the cast put in likable performances, and the script has some laughs, but it's divided between low brow and clever humor. I thought Popstar was a more effective comedy because it had a legitimate topic to take aim at. In Hot Rod, they aren't really making fun of anyone who deserves it. In that sense, it reminds me of Napolean Dynamite, except this movie dabbles with some nonsensical moments.",6,0,0,24 December 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Don't Know How I Felt About This Movie
","I really wasn't sure what to feel watching this movie. Having read the book, I knew the story, who the characters where, and what was going to happen. But it was still emotionally confusing. There isn't really a moment in this movie where you're allowed to fully feel the moment of what is happening. For every moment that should be happy or triumphant, such as Ron breaking the horcrux, you immediately have a scene reminding the characters of the sobering reality of their situation. The story piles on hardship after hardship. The action move very fast, with some of the sequences I enjoyed in the book going by so quick I didn't feel like I had the chance to savor them and look for all the details I had waited for (the first chase when Harry leaves home, for example). And that's pretty much how it continued. And actually that's basically how the book went. So you can say that this movie was extremely faithful to the source material, probably as much as any film adaption ever has been. I think I was maybe looking for the movie to provide something that the book didn't--maybe to help me realize how I felt about this story which just seemed to happen, without allowing me to feel a proper release after all the buildup. I am excited for part 2, even knowing how everything will turn out, but this time I won't expect the film to solve any of my issues for me.",6,2,2,24 December 2010
Salt," Just another 'save the world' action movie'
","Salt is an action movie that starts out mysteriously, then turns into a conventional 'save-the-world' action hero story. Angelina Jolie plays a female James Bond type--sorry folks, but that's basically all it is--who is involved with some sort of plan involving Russian spies and assassination plots. The first act is a lengthy chase, in which we get to see how resourceful and well trained our main character is. The second act, however, sells her as completely unstoppable as she takes on the entire Secret Service. I suppose we shouldn't even be surprised that the last part of the movie has her infiltrating the White House (she is even able to hot-wire security doors in the President's secret bunker). By this time, what started out as partially mysterious has become a completely conventional action movie, with our hero turning off nuclear missiles at the last moment before they are launched. There are going to be a lot of viewers who are more upset at the ending, which doesn't really unfold like we'd expect, than all the routine, predictable stuff that happens just before. The problem with the last couple minutes of the movie isn't that we don't get the resolution we expect, but that it is edited so choppily. If they had shown the same action happen with a some lingering shots instead of jittery jump-cuts, it could have worked.The other thing I want to say about this movie is that I read a review by Roger Ebert that made this movie sound really fun. He explained that most of the action is completely improbable, which is true, but he also called it 'trash,' which led me to believe it might be a little campy and over the top. But no, this movie takes itself very seriously. I don't recommend it.",4,4,9,24 July 2010
We're the Millers," Fun Comedy -- Hard R
","Entertaining comedy. Builds well and I liked the ending. Jason S. seems to be doing an 80s Bill Murray type of thing, and it stands out from the post-irony stuff that seems to be the norm. Anniston is miscast, but there were lots of great cameos and smaller roles. Ed Helms with his orca was a highlight, and Scotty P was memorable--his outtakes had me wanting more. I'm glad there are still some R-rated comedies being made that are making money, because a lot of the PG ones feel too restrained. I think after this movie and Wedding Crashers, we can consider any Fisher and Faber projects something to look forward too. Here's hoping for more.",6,0,1,30 December 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," Funny without being schmaltzy
","Much like P.T. Anderson's The Master, this is a movie I enjoyed, in large part, for the performances. I think Silver Lining Playbook has a very entertaining story to go with it. It didn't feel like another version of a story I'd already heard, and it didn't feel completely predictable. Another movie it reminded me of was Little Miss Sunshine, where a lot of the characters are going through difficult times, but it ends up fun and life-affirming somehow. Jennifer Lawrence and Robert DeNiro were especially great, and I'm glad they both were recognized for it. I think starting with a great script makes a big difference, but the performances were what made me feel it. When Tiffany asks, 'You love me?', I actually care if she ends up happy. It's nice when a movie can do that.",7,0,1,26 May 2013
Face_Off," Lots of Fun
","Here is one of the wildest movies ever to be released as a summer action blockbuster. The director lets Cage and Travolta go crazy, and mines the ridiculous premise to maximum effect. A sick killer and obsessed cop switch places and basically do a better job in each others' shoes. It seems to be saying that we all take those who are closest to us for granted. But it also has some insane shootouts and well earned humor. My favorite was how the terrorist turned out to be a better father to the cop's troubled teen. Travolta is especially fun trying to sound like Nicolas Cage, and the whole thing has an epic feel. They don't let little details get in the way, so if airtight logic is your thing, this won't work. But it's not sloppy or disposable either. It's big dumb fun.",7,1,3,3 May 2015
Ratatouille," Bit of a Disappointment
","Seeing this movie years after its release, I had pretty high expectations. Not only is it a Pixar movie (by Brad Bird!), it seems to have a reputation as one of their very best. I was disappointed for several reasons. I thought it was weird to cast Patton and not give him a single humorous line, but that doesn't make the movie less enjoyable. Neither does the fact that it's not really for young children, although that is also strange since Pixar usually makes movies that all ages can enjoy. What bothered me is that I didn't care at all about the story or the characters. I really don't get why it is so revered. I also wish they had used the opportunity to animate more of Paris. Take a look at the opening scenes of Woody Allen's Midnight In Paris and you'll see what I was hoping for. You can't deny that it is a work of impeccable quality--the effort pours out of every frame--but I don't see myself changing my opinion with future viewings.",4,2,6,9 January 2015
Bad Teacher," R-rated Comedy with Female Lead
","Cameron Diaz plays a teacher who is trying to save up for breast enlargement surgery because she thinks it will get her a rich husband. It was like a cross between Danny McBride in the first season of Eastbound and Down and Charlize Theron in Young Adult. Like both of those characters, Cameron's character remains mostly unrepentant throughout. Most of the humor comes from her couldn't-give-a-care attitude (which reminded me of another film creation, Billy Bob's Bad Santa) and raunchy language. The other part of the equation is the conflict with the bubbly teacher across the hall, Amy Squirrel. You don't forget a character like her, and Lucy Punch was cute while building towards increasingly unhinged behavior. Justin Timberlake was over the top as a gee-whiz never-could-exist-in-the-real-world idealist, and Jason Segal gets to be a regular guy. Out of the other supporting roles, I liked John Michael Higgins as the principal that also could never ever exist anywhere ever. I was glad they didn't go too far with making the lead character have some kind of change of heart or show some huge emotional growth, because that didn't fit the tone of this movie at all. What little changes she did show were even more than I wanted to see, but I stayed entertained right up until the final schmaltzy letdown. So it was, overall, a worthwhile comedy.",7,2,4,19 August 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man," A fun take on the Spider-Man story
","I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was fun and mostly well-written. I liked the casting and the visuals. They took many of the familiar elements of Spidey's origin and did two main things differently: they went further back into his childhood, involving his parents (particularly his father), and they set the story very firmly in the present. The scenes that take place in the school felt especially contemporary, as did the science lab. The equipment and technology were some of the better visual elements, showing colorful touchscreens and three-dimensional projections that are not yet in use, but felt like they might not be far off. I liked the character of Curt Conners, and I liked Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey. I felt like the movie got fairly formulaic in the last act, when the hero has to save the city in a battle on top of a skyscraper before the bomb goes off. But the first 3/4 of the movie were different. It didn't feel tired or clichéd, and it didn't feel like they took any shortcuts in the story, so it was a good setup. I would look forward to another installment by the same cast and filmmakers.",5,0,3,15 July 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Frustrating
","This movie kind of puts the X-Men continuity into weird territory. First Class made me care more about the characters than all but the very best stories from the comics. In this movie, we go back and forth between the young X-Men of Matthew Vaughn's film and the dismal looking Bryan Singer group. I'd rather just follow the story from where Vaughn left off. This movie starts in the furthest future of the team, as the sentinels have just about killed off every mutant. Professor X and Magneto join together to send Wolverine to the past and get everyone to work together to stop the darkest timeline. What I cared about most in this story is the redemption it kept teasing for Eric and Raven. Every scene she was in, I kept wanting her to change her mind and come back with Charles. There was even a line from the future Magneto as he was dying where he regrets all the years they fought each other. That was what I wanted to see most--everyone finally realize they would be better off working together. But these are stubborn characters and we will have to wait for the next movie to know if it works out. It will be hard to care about X-Men: Apocalypse if we don't get to see the cast from First Class again, but I am interested to see where it goes.",7,0,1,4 July 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Great Comic Book Movie
","This is brought back feelings of being young and reading Avengers comics. It is a smart film and well structured, but the giant battle in the middle overshadows everything else in the movie, maybe everything in every Marvel movie. Ant Man, Spider Man, The Vision, Scarlet Witch--it was great seeing it all come to life. I wasn't especially invested with the central conflict of why the group would be willing to fight each other, and I didn't care much about the reason they came up with in order to get Tony Stark and Steve Rogers against each other. I liked the Armor Wars storyline better as far as setting up that battle. But this is a movie with a lot of repeat viewability. It isn't nonstop fun like Guardians of the Galaxy, but it isn't as serious as Winter Soldier--more like a blend of the two. It ended up giving us another reason to hope for good things from the Infinity War series.",9,1,3,25 February 2017
Tropic Thunder," Great All The Way Through
","Here is a comedy that doesn't fizzle out half way through. Tropic Thunder is strong from start to finish. It sends up celebrity culture and does it from an insider's perspective. Robert Downey Jr. stands out, but I also liked McConahey, Stiller, and of course Tom Cruise. I would like more movies like this. What has Ben Stiller been doing lately?",8,0,0,24 January 2020
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Bread makes you fat?
","Now this was fun. I was all in right from the beginning, when it looked like it would be a character driven drama. Then, it took a turn into hyper realism and you have to decide you want to go along with the stylistic choices or if you can't handle something this different. Personally, I was ready for the ride. There was maybe too much fighting and some people will find the main character unlikeable, but I will watch this one back over and over.Edit: I have watched this back many times now, and it is one of my biggest favorites. My favorite comedy of all time, hands down. I didn't mention how awesome the music is, either--almost every song is on my playlist now. The only scene I don't really care for is the Roxy Richter battle. Other than that, I feel like it was made just for me.",9,0,0,1 May 2017
Inside Out," Tearjerker
","I think even more than 'animated feature' or 'family film,' the most accurate description for Inside Out would be 'tearjerker.' Pixar has made another highly emotional feature disguised as a colorful kids movie that will probably be best appreciated by adults. I enjoyed it all the way through. Everything about it was excellent--voice casting, character design, the look and feel--although I will need more viewings to decide how some of the story elements hold up, as there were sequences that went by very quickly. There was nothing too heavy or inappropriate, but because of its complexity, I don't recommend it for younger viewers. I do, however, think it is extremely special, was made with incredible care, and will be enjoyed for generations.",10,3,23,21 June 2015

Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4
","I will give this movie an 8 out of 10 because of how well made it is. All the technical aspects are world class. But this might be my least favorite of the Toy Story films, and that includes that shorts. I know that my opinion is influenced by the fact that I consider Toy Story 3 to have the most perfect ending in movie history, and that left my expectations as high as possible. I enjoyed the little glimpses of Bonnie we've seen in the short films, and I was excited to see what they would have her do with a full length story. I have to include in this review that I love the fact that they are consistent in having Bonnie say 'Hi' and 'Bye' to her toys without exception. But I didn't feel like #4 had any standout moments, like the toddler playtime in #3. It was just fine. I really hope that after some time passes, I'll watch it back and my appreciation for it will increase. I can't say I was disappointed, but it did leave me somewhat unsatisfied.",8,0,2,30 July 2019
Wreck-It Ralph," Tribute to Classic Video Games
","This movie is nearly perfect. I say nearly, but I don't think I've found anything lacking about it. You can see the unrelenting hard work that went into this movie. It is one of the best structured stories of any family film. Everything fits together logically. The visuals are also mind blowing, and the performances are wonderful. It belongs in the highest tier of Disney films. I hope it will be recognized as an enduring classic. I would like to say 'timeless,' but setting it in the world of video games may end up dating the story. If so, it would be the only minor shortcoming for a film that has everything a viewer could hope for.",9,1,1,26 May 2013
The Little Mermaid," Such a Great Story
","I think this film will be remembered as one of the great movies of all time. The animation may not be as lush as some, but it is structured perfectly, has wonderful settings, and great music. Ariel is an enduring character that draws you in every time. The filmmakers did an amazing job making you care about her and Eric and making them so likable. The scenes in the village classic fairy tale charm, and you also have one of the most entertaining villains every created. I used to read the Anderson fairy tale when I was young, and even as a kid, I could tell it was a special story. Disney changed it but still made something very special. I'm glad they put the work in to make this worth watching over and over.",9,0,0,10 August 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Wasn't that entertained
","This is the second time a QT film has disappointed me. My main complaint is that it is several 'day in the life' vignettes, but not an actual story. I kept waiting for an inciting incident. However, this might change with repeat viewings, because I recognize everything else about it is top-notch. Obviously, Tarantino is a director who can make exactly what film he sets out to make. I just didn't see any reason for making this one.",6,14,26,30 July 2019
Django Unchained," Watch and re-watch
","Fun dialog and great action. I like Christoph Waltz way more in this than Inglorious Basterds. There were many scenes in this movie that I went back and watched numerous times. I think some of the lines Samuel L. Jackson gets to deliver in this movie even top the most memorable ones from Pulp Fiction. I wasn't into Jamie Foxx as the lead character most of the time--I think I would have liked someone else better. I liked Leonardo in this better than anything else I've seen him in. He fits the role well. Some favorite parts are the exchange with Don Johnson when they first arrive at his plantation, the first few minutes we see Sameul L. Jackson's character, and the brief conversation between Django and Betina. Not the most flowing narrative, but it kept me glued to the end.",8,1,3,26 May 2013
Insidious," Horror movie with some contrasting elements
","This was a well-made horror movie that built slowly, increasing the tension as it went. A family is plagued by unseen forces, causing one of their children to slip into a coma. When they contact an expert, they find out ghosts and demons are trying to posses them, and the father has to enter the shadow world to get his kid back. There were some pretty effective moments, such as the scene in the fire demon's lair. This movie has some quieter moments with deliberate pacing, but also goes over the top in a way that makes it stand out. It has a sense of theatrics, such as the loud, flashy title card at the beginning. The ending is a cliffhanger, but after viewing the second movie, I don't hold that against them. It's not like some movies that leave things wide open--this ending had very specific plot points the sequel needed to follow up on. The mixture of low key and flashy scenes distinguish this movie from most current horror, and I enjoy watching back many of the well done segments.",7,0,0,27 September 2015
Frozen," High Level of Achievement With Much to Appreciate
","For months, I had been hearing that Disney expected this movie to be something very special. Whether that referred to the quality of the entertainment, or the marketability as a product, I wasn't sure, but I hoped for a film that would be moving and timeless, much like the other Hans Christian Anderson adaption in their catalog. The animation is amazing. The detail in the Scandinavian setting is probably my favorite thing about the movie, but the characters are also well designed, some of the most expressive in animation. Anna in particular is a character for the ages. Most of the rest play pretty straightforward roles, but the other standout is Olaf. When I saw the first trailer for this movie, I couldn't understand how such a silly looking, slapstick creation could be part of a movie that was rumored to be a modern classic. I was 100% satisfied with the comic relief he provided. It's so nice to have a character get laughs without any wisecracks or sarcasm. Another thing I really appreciated was that the female lead did not need a man to save her. We learn that Anna needs an act of true love to keep her from freezing solid, but it turns out to be an act of sisterly love. Despite these many strong points, my first impression is that Frozen doesn't rank with the highest tier of Disney classics. Something about the story just felt a little off, and the third act felt rushed. But it is definitely something very special. Also, the music is incredible. Idina Menzel's 'Let It Go' may be remembered as one of the greatest performances in any animated musical. I look forward to watching again and again over the years.",8,2,4,1 December 2013
Kick-Ass," Another Comic Adaption
","I was entertained by this movie, but a little disappointed as well. The beginning of the movie felt like I was seeing something different, and with all the superhero/comic movies being made now, it would be an accomplishment for someone to make one that felt like it had a unique perspective on the the genre. I think that for a little while, the fact that the movie has an R rating is what made it feel different, since the dialog didn't have to be as clean. I enjoyed most of the setup of the movie, with the kid becoming a hero and getting closer to the girl. Mid-way through the movie, we get the back story of Nicholas Cage's character, and the plot then becomes a typical action story (ex-cop turned vigilante trying to bring down big city drug lord???) It was the first big letdown, going from something fresh and different to a story we've heard a million times. The filmmakers keep it up in the air a little longer with the subplot about the gangleader's son becoming Red Mist and the ambiguity as to what he really wants. I wasn't sure if the kid wanted to really help his dad, or if he would break away and join Kick Ass. By the end, it really does turn into a by-the-numbers action movie with a climax ripped off from another big dumb action movie, True Lies. I think some viewers think that the fact that one of the characters was an 11 year old girl doing martial arts and killing lots of bad guys made this movie 'surprising' or 'original,' but under the surface, it was nothing new.",5,1,6,29 July 2013
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Holds Up Well
","This was a movie that has gotten a reputation for being something special, so I went in with somewhat raised expectations. Viewing it for the first time in 2013, it blew me away. Visually, it seems to be more detailed than most of the films that have been made since. Some of the songs are pure classics, and I'm guessing that I'll be hooked on more of them after a few more listens. For some reason, I expected it to start strong but not really go anywhere, but that was a misconception. There is nothing wrong with the story--no plot points that bother me, and a satisfactory resolution. I see why Oogie Boogie is so popular--his song was stuck in my head for quite a while afterwards. The characters are memorable, maybe iconic--well designed and performed. As much as I enjoyed it, I'm glad they never did a sequel--it should remain self-contained. Glad I finally took the time to see it.",7,1,1,15 December 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Maybe the most fun of any comic book movie
","This movie improves with repeated viewings. The first time I watched it, I just saw another bunch of heroes trying to stop a super villain from destroying the universe. For whatever reason, I didn't get it then but eventually did--this movie is pure fun. Great humor and (mostly) memorable characters make me forget how thin the story seemed at first. It sneaks up on you, but the world-building in this movie is also notable. This, combined with Super, makes me want to see James Gunn direct every movie from now on. Yes, it's a space adventure with a super villain trying to blow everything up, but somehow they get you to care. Peter Quill, Rocket Raccoon, and Groot have so many standout moments and lines that I would recommend this to just about anyone. Worth owning.",8,6,11,17 August 2014
Paranormal Activity," Freaky
","I found this movie to be very effective. It's hard to find movies that can build genuine suspense and sustain it as well. This one immediately drew me in. It didn't matter that I was seeing it after all the hype, I think because of the acting job done by the two leads. They created characters that made me want to find out what happened. As opposed to, say, Away We Go, which I had to turn off because I really couldn't stand the couple being portrayed.This is the simplest set-up possible: a man buys a video camera to record what goes on while he and his wife sleep. She senses that some sort of presence is visiting her, and over the course of the movie, the experiences intensify.This movie does follow one of the major clichés of the horror film, which is the 'smart people doing dumb things' syndrome. As the evil spirit begins to act more aggressively, the man only does more to antagonize it, and the girl doesn't really take any action.I much preferred the unrated ending, as I think the version shown in theaters fell flat. Did Steven Spielberg really suggest that ending? It was a very lame choice that extinguished all the tension built up to that point. The alternate choice was a better payoff.",7,1,2,14 June 2010
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not A Home Run
","I liked Age of Ultron overall after I thought about it for a while. Coming out of the theater, it felt like a disappointment, and I think that's because people hoped it would be better than the first. It's not, but it has some great sequences. I liked the new characters a lot. I'm very interested in what Scarlet Witch and The Vision can do in the next movie. I liked the character they created for Ultron, but he never really did anything interesting or memorable. Some aspects of the movie that should have been more clear were things that you had to put together for yourself, which shouldn't be a bad thing, but in this kind of movie, it is. Ultron's motivation, for example, is the main aspect driving the plot, and you really have to work it out of the subtext. For a superhero movie aimed at a wide audience, I don't think that was effective. Loki's true purpose only gets a passing mention in the first Avengers, but it was also backed up by the first Thor movie. Everything in that movie seemed to work; Ultron had me thinking, 'Well, I guess I can see that, if you look at it that way...' So while it was miles above the average action adventure film, high expectations clouded my judgment.",8,1,5,31 May 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Nowhere Near the Level of Pixar
","I saw this movie with a large group of children and adults. The kids loved it, as I think most would. A lot of the adults seemed to enjoy it from the standpoint of harmless entertainment. There were some clever bits, but a lot of heavy-handed schmaltz, too. I personally didn't think it worked for me. When you have choices out there that succeed on the level of a Toy Story 3, why waste time on mediocrity like this? It wasn't the worst concept--of course kids are going to love monsters--but the execution was just enough to get by. Unlike, say, a Pixar movie where they put everything they've got into every last detail, and you can see you're getting something timeless. It'll be fine as something fun to watch once in a while when the kids make me, but not one I'll treasure.",4,1,3,26 May 2013
Toy Story," One of the great movies of all time
","I enjoy watching this movie over and over. It is structured so carefully, I can pick up from any point and be immersed. I love reading about how it was made just as much as watching it, and collect books about Pixar and the making of these films. But as much as I enjoy the craft and history of Toy Story, I also think it deserves credit for its influence. It's just too bad that all the filmmakers that think they're working from the Toy Story template are missing the main ingredient: story. Pixar worked and reworked this script for years and refused to quit until they got it right. Woody and Buzz, Pizza Planet, Andy's Bedroom, Sid--I only wish I had appreciated it for what it was upon its release. But I get it now. And I will be there for whatever this company does next.",10,0,1,25 May 2015
Midsommar," So Many Feels
","This movie made me feel almost as bad as if something happened to someone I cared about. Which is to say, I had a strong emotional reaction to it. It made me feel terrible. But it was an absolute experience. I don't know if I'm glad that I saw it at the theater, but I'll never forget it either. I am not sure that I could ever watch it back again. Florence Pugh is top-level. She is now poised to be a major talent. Her performance carries the story. Still, this is not a movie that entertains the viewer; I think it is meant to make you feel things you don't ordinarily feel, but you may not like which emotions it brings out.",8,1,5,30 July 2019
Super 8," Tries to be 80s Spielberg but doesn't entertain
","Here was a mildly entertaining movie about an alien getting loose in a small town. There is some bits about kids trying to make their own film and a huge train crash. They figure out there is an alien trying to get home who is misunderstood and they kind of befriend it. I really can't even remember any of the characters from this movie. It's kind of like Stranger Things with none of the interesting storytelling or likable characters. Which is to say, not nearly as good. In fact, I'd say Stranger Things does such a better job of honoring 80s Spielberg as to render this movie irrelevant. You don't get to see much of the alien. And I didn't find myself caring much about what any of the characters did. Hard pass.",6,1,3,26 December 2016
Thor," For the Honor and Gloy of Asgard!
","One of my favorite comic book characters, I never expected anyone to make a movie about Thor that was any good. Casting Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston made all the difference. Seeing the trailers, I didn't think they really looked the part. Chris especially seems small compared to what I would envision. But both are extremely enjoyable to watch as Thor and Loki, and I liked a lot of the other Asgardians as well. The frost giants looked great, the rainbow bridge was cool, and the fight with the Destroyer was fun. On top of that, the three scientists that find Thor are all good characters. I like the arc they set up for Thor in this movie. It came as a surprise after reading comics for so many years where Thor was already noble and mature. Making him start out as a short-sighted brat was a good idea. He has to earn the right to be the son of Odin again by be willing to sacrifice himself to save earth. When we see him in the Avengers movie and he talks about how he enjoyed battle when he was younger, it gives the character even more resonance. I am looking forward to part two, because this movie and the Avengers were a lot of fun.",8,1,2,26 May 2013
Zombieland," I don't think we're gonna be able to stitch this
","Zombieland was fine. It didn't blow my socks off or anything, it was something to watch. I'm not a big fan of any of the performers and their work here didn't change that. The script was just good enough that I was able to keep watching, but it never soared. The climax was a zombie shoot out in an amusement park, and I felt like the filmmakers expected they were doing something epic. It was not. I didn't really laugh, although I did appreciate the cameo. Points for everyone for going through with that. Overall, largely forgettable and not one I'll watch again.",6,0,1,27 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Harry Potter 2
","Spoilers in this review.In Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter goes back to school for his second year of learning to be a wizard. Whereas the first movie was more episodic, this one tends to be more cohesive, focusing on the mystery of the Chamber.Students are being attacked at Hogwarts by an unseen monster, and messages are being left that claim it is because someone opened the Chamber of Secrets. We are told that this is the hiding place of a monster who is supposed to get rid of anyone who doesn't have magical parents, and the one who has opened it is the modern day servant of the evil wizard who created the chamber.It turns out that a 'memory' of Voldemort possessed one of the kids and used them to open the chamber. Harry finds the entrance to the chamber and confronts Voldemort. He isn't real, but nearly gains enough power to come to life before Harry destroys him and the monster, and everything goes back to normal.This episode didn't leave me wanting more as much as some of the others. My favorite thing about it was the comedy: the opening scenes with Harry's family, and the character played by Kenneth Branagh, who was nicely over the top as the self absorbed fraud. The ending was a bit anti-climatic, and there are many reasons why Christopher Columbus was not a very good choice to direct the Harry Potter series. Each of the films that have come after these first two have been much better done. This one spends way too much time explaining things rather than showing us. I think it is probably the weakest of the bunch.",5,1,1,15 July 2010
Steve Jobs," 'Could you teach me more things on the computer?'
","My main criticism of this movie will be that it feels like a cliff notes version of the biography. I felt like the screenwriter read through the book and highlighted the parts that had the most dramatic interest, then organized them into story beats. Now, of course Danny Boyle made a great looking movie that is visually interesting and well edited. Of course the performances are award- worthy. But somehow I felt like this movie was delivering facts I had already learned without really getting me emotionally involved in the on screen drama. I've read a lot of books about the Beatles, but when I watched Backbeat, I was somehow able to imagine I was seeing a young Lennon and caring about where that story was going. That didn't really happen during Steve Jobs, except for the scenes with Lisa, which I think might have been a better story to focus entirely on. I do think the narrative device of setting the action during the product launches was a step towards narrowing a sprawling life and career into a specific movie going experience, but it still suffers from too much not being enough. There is a maxim in writing that says 'Through specificity comes universality.' I think the most universal scenes were the ones where he interacts with his daughter, and those were the scenes I most enjoyed.",6,0,1,23 December 2015
Hercules," Lesser Family Film
","Hercules is a Disney movie that doesn't quite reach greatness. When you look at some of the pieces, it seems like it should be memorable: Hades is one of the more entertaining villains and along with Pain and Panic offer some age-of-irony comic relief. Megara is one of the more interesting love interests in a children's film, coming off like a female James Cagney. The songs are fun, though not strong enough on their own to become hits. The obvious weak link is the central character, Hercules himself. There isn't enough character development to make us really care about anything that happens. He may as well be the nameless prince from Snow White for as much as we learn about him. I don't think his desire to become a god really connects with people-- many of us may have felt like we were out of place, but the whole goal of rejoining his immortal family just feels like the rich getting richer. It has some entertaining segments, and it has some boring segments, and overall is just an average animated feature.",5,0,3,8 March 2017
Sausage Party," Didn't Find It Funny
","Maybe I need to watch it back again, but I was disappointed by this movie. I expected it to be exactly my kind of humor, but instead I just thought it was boring. Almost every Seth Rogan movie had been among my favorite comedies, but I don't think I laughed at all during this one. I don't think the fact that it was animated was the problem, because when I saw the trailer, I thought it looked good. Not only did I not enjoy it much, I can't even hardly tell you anything that happened in it, so it wasn't very memorable either. I can say that it looks terrible--the character designs are as unappealing as anything since Food Fight. I don't think that would matter if I liked the script, though.",3,0,3,25 February 2017
Joker," No regrets
","I liked Joker. JP was great fun to watch, and the atmosphere is great. It establishes a tone and sticks to it all the way through. It builds tension and has good payoffs. It's the kind of movie that I could walk into at any point and be drawn in to want to finish viewing. I hope they go through with a sequel. Normally, I wouldn't say that, but this movie just begs for it.",7,4,7,16 February 2020
Whiplash," Tight
","Here was a movie that snapped me to attention and kept me transfixed from the first second it began. I watched this movie on my computer and had only turned it on to check the quality of the file. I had my hand on the keyboard, ready to close the movie and go back to what I had been doing before my download finished. I sat like that for the whole movie, ready to stop watching after the current sequence ended, but drawn further into the story. I watched it later into the night than I meant to, knowing that I wouldn't get enough sleep for how early I needed to get up. Whiplash is certainly one of the tightest movies ever made, in terms of both writing and editing, but those elements work in tandem with the performances. Miles Teller pushing himself beyond his limits, sweating and bleeding, give the movie an urgency that fits the technical austerity. And of course JK Simmons, who won every award a supporting actor possibly could, for one of the most intense acting jobs ever put on film. Are the characters likable? Is the instructor's theory flawed? Was the journey worth what they put each other through? Go to the boards to discuss, but recognize that this movie will squeeze you like a ball of playdough between its fingers and you will not walk away unaffected.",8,1,2,27 September 2015
Army of Darkness," Listen up, screwheads
","I'll say first off that this is an uneven movie, meaning that there are some great high points, and then some dips into long, inexplicable sequences that don't seem to match with the rest. The movie follows Ash, a hilariously flawed character, fumbling his way through a fish out of water story. He's sent back into medieval times and has to help some knights defeat an evil undead army. Granted, he basically unleashes the threat himself and tries his best to slip away without cleaning up his own mess, but that's Ash 101. He makes time to romance the women, of course, and if they beg him to stay, he lets them know all those promises he made were 'just pillow talk, baby.' Lots of great lines and a sense of fun all the way through. I don't think I would call the humor ironic, but it's not entirely straightforward either. I'm glad they made the TV series, but I'm still hoping for another movie.",8,2,3,7 January 2016
Kingpin," One of the least funny comedies ever made
","I put off watching this movie for a long time. I'm not sure what I had against it; I guess I assumed it was just some raunchy piece of trash. Well, I decided that was what I was in the mood for, so I gave it a chance. I don't understand how anyone can find this funny. It's mind boggling to me that this is a Farrelly brothers movie it's so tame. People write about it being crude and outrageous, but it was actually one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. It's not even edited like a comedy--something feels off the entire running time. Sometimes I'm put off by a movie when it turns out to be something other than what I expected. In this case, it wasn't that my expectations were too high, it was just that I was watching one of the lamest, least entertaining comedies ever put to film.",2,2,7,22 April 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Reviewing the look more so than the story
","Seeing this film in IMAX 3D probably helped me enjoy it much more than I would have in standard format. I came away from the showing not focused so much on the story and characters, but what was accomplished through the visuals. Even the quieter scenes had something interesting to look at. With some of the other 3D films I've seen, the effect loses its impact after a certain amount of time. The Hobbit was incredible right to the end. As it happens, I enjoyed the action and performances as well. I thought all three of these movies were fun and full of the joy of both making movies and telling stories. Reading through the other comments people have made, I see that many viewers nitpicked on small details which then seemed to ruin their experience. I hope I don't allow myself to end up like that, because I could have missed out on one of the best movie going experiences I can remember.",Null,2,6,9 January 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Timeless
","Although I've known the story all my life, I never actually saw this movie as a kid. Watching it all the way through for the first time, I was amazed; watching it over and over with my daughter, my appreciation only grows.Snow White isn't my favorite Disney movie, but I don't think you can overstate its influence. I also acknowledge that it has its flaws--Snow White's submissive character and her squeaky voice are often criticized. I also don't think the songs are that great, but where I will defend this movie is in its storytelling. Yes, it is a very simple plot, but that is its strength. It relies on visuals and keeps things uncomplicated, which means that very young children can understand some of the action, even if they aren't able to follow the entire story arc. It's the same reason that the first half of Wall-E gets so much praise. Both have breathtaking visuals, also--they way that Snow White and the witch move is actually more interesting to watch, for me, than almost anything else in animation. I think I read somewhere that they were rotoscoped, which is a process that has been used before and since, but for me, this is the pinnacle of what the technique can do.So many of the animated movies of the last 20 years are filled with adult-level in-jokes, sarcastic sidekicks, and rapid-fire pacing that plays to short attention spans. It would be nice to have more stories that didn't try to be so full of irony, and instead focus on the things that make a story truly timeless.",10,3,3,26 February 2010
Inception," Is This A Crime Story?
","I didn't pay very close attention to this movie, so I didn't always pick up on all the little details. Even so, I enjoyed it all the way through and felt like I followed the basic story. With it's reputation of being complicated, I expected a labyrinthine plot, but it was fairly linear. The part that you had to pay attention to was the rules of entering and functioning inside dreams. I can't really say any of the performances were particularly great, and I think casting Marion Cotillard as the love interest wasn't as effective as they thought it would be. Even so, it was a tense thriller that kept me wanting to know what would happen right until the end.",6,0,2,22 March 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Depressingly made family film
","I don't think I really liked anything about this movie. It was not an interesting story, it wasn't pleasant to look at, and none of the characters were likable. It's sad that something this thoughtlessly made could be such a commodity. As I watched, I just saw moment after moment of things happening without any reason for me to care. I honestly believe the story didn't matter to the people who went to see this--they just wanted to watch some computer animated animals. Much of it was actively grating, almost like the filmmakers wanted to squeeze out the most hateful children's movie possible to see if it would still sell. It did.",2,1,4,25 February 2017
Finding Dory," Disappointed
","I thought Finding Dory was a letdown. After the first Nemo movie and Wall-E, only a masterpiece of the same magnitude would have satisfied. The story of this movie is that Dory, the beloved character from Finding Nemo, makes her way to an aquarium to find her parents. Most of the movie consists of her making her way through the facility trying to track down where she came from. There are a lot of scenes of her being carried in a pail, swimming through pipes, and moving through nice looking scenery. I just wasn't moved by any of it. When the movie arrives at its climax, I felt no emotional payoff. There was also an action sequence near the end that drained any interest I had of not only finishing the movie, but of visiting these characters again. This movie was just a series of empty obstacles with no reason for viewers to care.",4,1,4,25 February 2017
Parasite," Found A Job
","I enjoyed this movie. It had some surprises in it, and I really couldn't predict where it was going to end up. It was extremely well made and well written, and the performers all did a great job. I guess the ending bothered me a little bit, but I'll admit it helped to reinforced what the movie was trying to say.",7,0,0,31 March 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Doesn't Measure Up To The Praise
","Birdman had an interesting setup and drew me in well enough. Hearing that this is the movie that could win Michael Keaton an Oscar was my biggest motivation for seeking it out. It reminded me a little of Manchurian Candidate in that you weren't sure what the significance of what you were watching, which creates a unique atmosphere. Eventually, however, it turns out to just be about a guy who puts on a play that luckily becomes successful despite some bumps in the road. On top of that, the open ended finish invites us to interpret some of the stranger moments. Except that the movie told an almost straightforward, linear narrative. The effect was that I had no interest in digging deeper. I didn't care much about the characters or their success or failure. It felt like a movie that threw in some stylistic tricks to make up for a routine story. Many of those elements were well done, such as the acting and the soundtrack, but it did not add up for me.",5,1,6,23 February 2015
The Conjuring," Very Well Done
","This was really, really scary. It was also really well made. It's crazy how many amazing movies James Wan has made in such a short time. He must be in line for some serious comparisons to great directors of the past by now. I thought this movie was well cast, was paced perfectly, and had an unbelievable look. I would be curious to know if these things are harder or easier to do in the horror genre. I would guess it's easier to stand out with a well-made, original- looking product, since so many horror films are made cheaply or without vision. But the Conjuring takes things that have already been done plenty of times--possession and exorcism--and still makes a story that is likely to be a classic of the genre.",8,1,2,25 May 2015
Marriage Story," Unforgettable
","I thought the most memorable parts of this movie were the scenes with Laura Dern. When she was talking, the movie kicked into high gear. But that's not to discount the other performers. Scarlet Johannson and Adam Driver are great, and this movie is both touching and heartbreaking. I feel like I won't forget this one.",8,5,8,5 January 2020
X-Men: First Class," Kind Of Sad
","I read about all the major Marvel and DC characters in the comics when I was younger. At the time, the X-Men were probably the best written on a consistent basis. But I don't think they were ever as well written as I felt they were in this movie. And I don't think I ever cared about the characters as much as I did watching First Class. The relationships between Charles and the two main villains, Magneto and Mystique, are so poignant. I think I responded to this movie more on an emotional level than any other comic book movie. The Avengers might be more fun, and Winter Soldier might be more expertly crafted, but this one has the most effective melodrama. It's almost a tearjerker, although not in an overly sentimental way. The fact that Charles Xavier taught Magneto to believe in himself, but then they still turned against each other--almost coming to blows, but still caring about each other-- well, that was the major achievement, more so than any special effects.",8,2,4,25 May 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Not really a fan
","I didn't really enjoy the Christopher Nolan trilogy, and I am not sure why. I don't think there was anything in them, thematically or otherwise, that really interested me. I liked the villain, Bane, mostly for his cool accent. The movie had a decent build, with Bane defeating Batman and taking over Gotham, but I really didn't follow what it was for. Then the final sequence where they are trying to find the bomb in time felt really generic. Another superhero-saves-the-world-at-the-last-minute type of deal that had zero interest or suspense. I really don't care about any of the questions that the movie might be raising about how far does Batman have to go to stop terrorists who don't play by any rules. I didn't care about any of the characters or performances, except maybe Gary Oldman. By the time we find out about Talia and who everyone is, I felt like everything had deflated. It was well made, but I was just never into it.",6,8,16,23 November 2012
Iron Man," Fun
","I thought this movie was entertaining all the way through. I grew up reading comics, but I don't usually enjoy superhero movies. What I liked about this one is that nothing looked bad from a design/art direction standpoint. Sometimes even movies with good stories will have costumes or equipment that just look terrible, but the Iron Man armor looked great. Of course, Robert Downey Jr. makes the Tony Stark character almost as iconic as what Johnny Depp did with Jack Sparrow. I didn't watch this movie with my kids, but I thought it was more geared towards teens than elementary age. There were a lot of adult themes that I think would be hard for younger kids to sit through, and lots of stretches without action. There are scenes of womanizing, some graphic war violence, and corporate politics, which I thought would either bore or be a little graphic for preschoolers. I mention this because there is obviously lots of marketing directed at that age group. When the fight scenes are shown, they are exhilarating. At this point, Iron Man 3 is already out, and there is talk of RDJ leaving the franchise. It wouldn't be the same if he left.",7,0,3,26 May 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Suckfest
","I agree with all the criticisms of this movie. I liked nothing about it. I hated the performances, especially Jesse as Lex. I hated the dour tone and the colorless palette. I really don't even want to waste the time talking about all the problems with the story. This movie is so silly, it's been selected for review by podcasts dedicated to discussing bad movies. Anyone who wants to know how I felt about it can listen to any one of those dissections. I don't like the direction the DC films are going in and I wish they would stop making money so that the producers would rethink their approach.",3,2,5,25 February 2017
Monsters University," Work hard to reach your goal
","Like many Pixar fans, I have high expectations when I see their films. This one, I totally appreciated. Some criticisms are that it felt a little formulaic with the scare games plot device, and maybe not as sentimental as some of their more emotional stories. What I liked was that it was obvious that a tremendous amount of work went into it that can be appreciated over many viewings. I felt that the world and the characters of this movie mostly felt consistent with the original movie, although I thought Mike didn't seem so type-A in the first one. I don't think any of the new characters will become my favorites, but they were still excellent. I liked everything about the look of the movie--they are perfectionists with colors, lighting, design, and every other technical aspect. I always like reading the making-of books and seeing the concept art, along with all the other things that go into the movies, such as sources of inspiration. The ending really tied it all together for me. I felt like everything up to that point had been leading to that moment, and it was inspiring to see Mike reach his goal.",6,5,6,13 July 2013
Toy Story 3," Changed my mind about so many things
","Toy Story 3 blew me away. I wasn't a fan of the series before; now, I love all the movies and characters. The animation is so beautiful to look at that you couldn't give anything less than a perfect grade in that aspect. The voicework/acting is almost as impressive. It seems like such a miracle that anyone was able to assemble a cast where every player is able to make so much out of their characters. No one falls flat or disappoints. If I have one criticism, it's that it's a little too action-based and busy. There aren't really any moments like in Wall-E where you're just watching things happen--every moment is pushing the story along, explaining things, and moving to the next obstacle. I also thought there were too many scenes of toys finding ways to break out of places. I understand it is basically a prison-escape movie, but there were so many sequences like this, it felt overdone. I can't let these nitpicks affect my overall rating, however, because this movie does something so amazing with the final goodbye sequence, it makes up for all of it. I think that for me, it is the most special moment in any movie I've ever seen. I only wish I could have watched this movie in theater as a fan of the series already. And then all the extra stuff during the credits just adds a tremendous amount of more storytelling. It's so totally satisfying that this almost instantly became one of the movies that I care about so much that I don't want to watch it too often, so that it remains as affecting as possible. Put all this together along with the short cartoon 'Hawaiin Vacation,' which continues the story, and I am begging for a fourth Toy Story. The filmmakers pulled off a number of miracles, but think about how staggering this is: not only does this movie build upon the characters and their choices over the previous two movies, not only is it more rewarding for culminating all the themes and emotional payoffs in the first two, but even after wrapping it all up with the most beautiful resolution possible--maybe the greatest movie ending ever--it also sets up a new beginning that is just as rich for exploring. Even more than Andy, I want to see what life is like for the toys with Bonnie. I would buy a movie of just Bonnie playing with the toys for an hour and a half. I wish I could let everyone who worked on this know how much it means to me and how inspiring it is. Awesome.",10,2,4,21 March 2012
Trainspotting," One of My Biggest Favorites
","I don't have any criticisms of this film. I like the story, the acting, the music, and the filmmaking. It's fun, humorous, sad, and exciting. I like the book, but I like how the movie was able to distill it into a linear narrative (it's still a bit episodic, but they did a great job). The casting is a miracle--every one of the principles went from complete unknowns to big projects. I especially like the dialog full of slang and regional quirks. I have sought out everything by the Irvine Welsh, and enjoyed all his books. This is exactly my sense of humor. I appreciate how they take things to the extreme. The visuals do get a little gross once or twice, but it is well utilized. Nearly Perfect.",10,1,2,3 May 2015
Jojo Rabbit," It's a normal stalemate
","Here was something different. A young boy living in Nazi Germany idolizes Hitler but then falls in love with a girl hiding in his house. I didn't find this movie laugh out loud funny. I was more like thinking in my head that there were some clever moments. And one shocking one. I didn't really get that invested in it, but it did have a nice, satisfying ending.",6,2,5,2 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Good enough for now
","Watching this movie was an odd experience. It was entertaining and well made, but didn't quite feel like a Star Wars movie. Most everything was handled well--the effects looked good, the dialog was fine, and some interesting new characters were introduced. My first impression after one viewing is that it's not a great movie on its own. The things that people will like about it are the pieces of the original trilogy--the characters, settings, and story beats redone for the fans who grew up with them. The one element that I thought they got entirely right was the character of Rey. Her arc from desert survivalist to powerful hero was maybe enough to make new fans out of first time viewers to the series. The rest just feels like fan service, albeit done very skillfully.",6,5,16,21 December 2015
Cinderella," Nearly Perfect
","I can't call this a perfect movie, but it might be the movie that captures the Disney magic most fully. The story was one of the most beloved fairy tales already. What this movie did was add amazing visuals, which I credit largely to the stylings of Mary Blair. Her concept art give this movie and Peter Pan such a magical, dreamlike quality that they take me into their worlds every time I watch them. There were some sequences that were done so amazingly well I never tire of seeing them--the chase after the ball, the tearing of the dress, the dance with the prince, and the final sequence with the fitting of the slipper. I think some of the sequences that feel like filler involve the mice and the cat, and I also think the animation is on a lower level for some of those characters. The songs aren't the strongest, but do end up being memorable. The bottom line is that this is a movie that has kept its appeal for many, many years, and still brings the magic even today.",8,1,3,1 January 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Scene by Scene Spoilers
","I'm going to rate this movie very high because of all the work that went into it. It is a very detailed, impressive movie in a visual sense. The story follows the book pretty closely, with a few minor changes that I didn't think detracted much. Most of the movie worked very well. I'll go through each sequence: 1. Shell Cottage -- My favorite thing here was the cottage itself. I didn't really understand, in the book, why it was so important for Harry to decide between finding the Deathly Hallows or destroying the Horcruxes. A big problem I had with the book was all the backstory given to the Hallows, only for them to not really matter. Some people seem to think that by choosing not to try to get the Hallows, he is avoiding the temptation to pursue power, but I never really got that. The whole subplot was confusing and felt unfinished. The movie pretty much avoids Harry's conflict as much as possible, which I thought worked in its favor.2. The Bank -- everything here was perfect. The dragon was amazing, maybe the best cg creature ever.3. Diagon Alley -- much of what we find out in the book is avoided here. I think this also makes it easier for the viewer, because just like the Hallows, the subplot about Dumbledore's past and his motivations didn't feel like it needed to be there, and left a bunch of unanswered questions.4. The return to Hogwarts -- Harry reuniting with his friends was exciting, and the scene with the Grey Lady took something that wasn't especially memorable from the book and made it a highlight. I think it's interesting that two creatures who only got a little bit of screen time--the dragon and the Gray Lady--were done so well, I thought they could have an entire movie built around each. The dragon could be amazing in either a fantasy film or a giant monster movie. The Gray Lady was scarier than most horror film villains, and I could immediately imagine her in her own haunted house feature.5. Snape's memories -- not as much of Lily's childhood as I'd like, but a fine condensation of the main points.6. The final battle--a lot of it went too quickly. The movie was only about two hours. I would have liked more time to really stop and see what was happening, but it all went by at lightning speed. The standoff between Bellatrix and Molly Weasley was the biggest casualty. I really wanted to savor it, from the moment the kids start fighting her. Instead, it felt like it lasted about 10 seconds. Really, from the moment Voldemort walked back in with Harry's body, I started to feel like it was losing steam instead of building to the climax. I wasn't a big fan of most of the choices, especially how they changed that moment in the courtyard with Neville and the sword. Also, be prepared to have a lot of explanations not show up, especially as concerns Dumbledore. Like I said, I would have been fine if the whole conflict over his past had never been a part of the book, but thankfully the movie doesn't confuse us by making an issue out of it.The ending felt a little bit rushed also, which I think undercut what should have been an emotional payoff from 10 plus years of movies and books. We needed to see the main characters really show that the strain was finally lifted and have a moment of private celebration with just the trio. Instead, they were kind of cold and emotionless as Harry destroyed the elder wand. And the epilogue just left me wanting more time with the characters instead of satisfied at how their lives had turned out. This has to be the biggest movie production to ever leave me feeling vaguely unsatisfied.",Null,2,3,17 July 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Meh
","I read the first couple pages of this book just to see where the author might go after the first story ended. I have never been hooked so quickly and so hard as I was by Catching Fire. It ended up being a page turner for me, and actually renewed my interest in reading. As a film, I thought this was a fairly bland translation. I didn't much like the casting or the look--the way it was filmed, the colors, the costumes, everything. It didn't need to be any better than it was to be successful because the book was so well written, but as a companion, I find the film to be extremely disposable. I watched it once just to see the story in live action, but I won't revisit it. On a side note, I almost never enjoy dystopian fiction--especially sci- fi--but like I said, this book drew me right in.",5,3,7,25 May 2015
Heat," I don't think there is anything I would change about this movie
","Heat is the story of a cop and the criminal he is chasing. It is directed by Michael Mann, and his filmmaking style is very evident, mostly in the look and in the score. There are many great performances, and I find it endlessly watchable. I can start watching this movie at any point and be drawn in to watching the rest. Every scene is great. Having taken so long to get made, I consider this movie a masterpiece and a towering achievement. I often wonder when I watch it how well others remember it--it doesn't seem to get discussed much in articles or lists. But I consider it to be the best work of every performer in it. I have to give it a ten.",10,0,0,2 February 2020
What We Do in the Shadows," New Zealand Mockumentary Delivers
","This movie felt like a feature length episode of The Office with a little bit more artsy sets. Taking place in Wellington, it focuses on three vampires sharing a home, biting throats, and hitting clubs. Since they are all hundreds of years old, much of the best comedy comes when they get a new roommate. Having just become a vampire, the character Nick wants all the attention of a reality TV star, causing friction with the conservative elders. We get one of the better lines of the movie when Nick's carelessness results in one of the vampires being 'burnt to a sizzle,' and he is put on trial. There is some haggling as to just how long his indefinite banishment from the house will last, and his sad departure feels like we're watching the first season of Real World. Besides Nick, the other great side plot involves a group of werewolves. Neither group is especially hardcore, and the two gangs get into frequent confrontations, not unlike the milquetoast showdown in Swingers. It uses hand-held cameras and lots of improvised dialog, two techniques that seem to put a lot of people off. Personally, I enjoy the delivery and timing of the performers enough that I expect I'll be willing to watch it back again and again, indefinitely.",8,0,1,3 October 2015
Deadpool," Fun comic book movie
","What I appreciated about this movie is that it manages to be such a fun comic book adaption as well as gleefully earning its R rating. The violence and language enhanced the tone which I would describe as a giggling middle schooler getting away with something. I didn't think it had the depth that some reviewers seemed to attribute to it--I think the love story was more important for some than others. I thought the fact that Deadpool didn't call his girlfriend and tell her he was alive was frustrating. I kind of liked Colossus, but he looked a little too CGI. I'm not sure where I stand with Ryan Reynolds' performance. He might have been the perfect person to play Deadpool, but something about him was slightly annoying. Not much else to say, except that I will be looking forward to the sequel.",7,1,4,25 February 2017
Pineapple Express," One of my favorite comedies
","Even though it's been out less than two years, I would feel secure rating this as one of my favorite comedies of all time. This is exactly my sense of humor, and I don't mean the drug jokes. In fact, this might be the only pot-humor movie I've even liked.Pretty much everyone cast is this movie is great, with my favorites being Seth Rogan and Danny McBride. They have fun roles, and they were obviously allowed to improvise. I love the fact that it was directed by David Gordon Green, who was credited by many as having giving us one of the most authentic portraits of young love in All The Real Girls. The movie is structured more along the lines of a big budget buddy pick, but the dialog is strong enough to lift it above 99% of comedies I've ever seen. Add in one of the great final scenes of all time, and I'm giving this one an 8 out of 10. I can watch this one over and over.",8,5,9,15 June 2010
Aladdin," Off The Charts Fun
","This movie is as fun as a movie can be. It was hard to believe, coming after Beauty and the Beast, that Disney would slam it home again, but I still remember the feeling of satisfaction of seeing this in the theater. Animated movies, which had been such a big part of my childhood, were officially great again. And the movie holds up. It's another one that finds a way to get your interest early and maintain the excitement right on through. None of the songs are personal favorites, although the short reprise of 'Prince Ali' is deliciously demented. The animation is beyond world-class, obviously the product of an insane level of work. But the movie also continues to influence family films, for better or worse. Just like Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark ushered in the age of the quick-cut short attention span blockbuster, Genie and Iago made sure every animated kids production had to have sarcastic, wisecracking characters spouting off insults that usually went over young viewers heads'. Movies like Pulp Fiction, Forest Gump, and Aladdin brought in the age of irony, and pop culture has pretty much resided there ever since.",10,1,1,25 May 2015
Inside Llewyn Davis," Fails To Entertain
","So I think this movie is saying that terrible people can be capable of beautiful art. It spends its time following around a folk singer bumming through Manhattan. He gets his friend's girlfriend pregnant, he sleeps at other peoples' apartments, he treats people poorly, and then he gets on stage and sings nicely. That's it. When the movie ended, I decided I hadn't really cared about anything I'd watched, and I wasn't especially taken by its message, either. Are the filmmakers trying to excuse themselves for something they've done by making a movie about the redeeming qualities of art? It's kind of like what Woody Allen seemed to be saying with Deconstructing Harry. But the bottom line was that there weren't any very entertaining moments.",5,2,7,22 March 2017
Pocahontas," Looks Great
","After one viewing, I am not sure what I think about the story of this movie. It doesn't feel like a typical children's movie, although I watched it with a group of 5 year-olds, and it totally kept them interested (the rating should probably be PG because of the violence--one character is shot to death pretty prominently). I thought in terms of subject matter, things were handled well. My feeling on presenting history inaccurately is that you shouldn't be expecting Disney movies to be faithful to anything other than marketability. Where the movie surprised me is how amazing it was visually. You can tell that's where the work really went into, and the time spent developing the look of the characters totally paid off. I'll watch this one again.",6,0,1,16 July 2013
