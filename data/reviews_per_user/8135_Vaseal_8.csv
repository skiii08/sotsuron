Spartacus," inspired movie making
","This is one of the greatest epic movies ever made.  It would never have been made at all if Kirk Douglas had been given the role of Judah Ben Hur in William Wilder epic masterpiece Ben-Hur. Burt Lancaster had also been considered for the role but turned it down.  Kirk was offered the role of Messala opposite Charlton Heston but he turned it down refusing to play second bill to a young upstart such as Heston.Douglas made Spartacus purely to get back at MGM and William Wilder.  This need for revenge drove Douglas to make what is a truly great film.The Direction given for Anthony Mann and Stanley Kubrick is excellent.  The cast is also flawless.  Kirk was clever enough to cast all the Americans in the film as Slaves and Gladiators including himself. The English actors in the Film were all cast as Romans, Olivier, Laughton and Ustinov. This made perfect sense as the Romans and Slaves now sounded different. This makes the film all the more believable.This film is one of my all time favourites, but I often wonder if kirk had got his way and had starred in Ben-Hur, would this film have ever been made ???A final word on the lovely Jean Simmons.  She is one of the most beautiful women that has ever graced the silver screen",9,7,11,7 July 2000
Underworld," What Kate did. Oh dear look what Kate did next..
","I had the misfortune to endured 15 minutes of Underworld last night. Not even the lovely (but talent less) Kate Beckinsale in Leather could hold my interest. I kind of liked the Vampire V Werewolf theme (When I was reading the synopsis in the telly guide), but the acting was terrible, the characters unbelievable and the plot absurd.To be fair, perhaps it improved as it went on, but I doubt it. A master class with Laurence Olivier wouldn't have improved the acting in this movie.I would be the first to admit that Kate Beckinsale is a babe, but her acting always leaves a lot to be desired. They say she is good in the aviator. As I haven't seen that film yet I can't comment but really all this lady is eye candy and shouldn't be a leading lady in any movie.Sorry Kate, but the truth hurts and she gets paid big money to deliver and seldom if ever does...I can accept Vampire firing silver bullets to kill Werewolves, but werewolves firing bullets mad of sunlight to kill Vampires? Give me a break..And this technology was developed by pre-historic werewolves living in dirty cellars under subway stations.So avoid this movie, you will be glad you did....",1,15,29,17 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Inspired Movie Making
","I had often wondered why I had never read The Lord of the Rings books. I was always amazed at the enthusiasm, dedication and loyalty of the countless people I know who absolutely adore these tales. I said to myself 'what's all the fuss about? They are only silly childern's books!!Well I could not have been more wrong!! The LOTR is a tremendous story, which totally captivated me for three very short hours! It paints a huge canvas of a totally alien world filled with Hobbits, Elves and giants! An alien world but at the same time a world which has many similarities to our own.  There is Good V Evil, Friend V Foe, Love V Hate. And at the centre of all is the most unlikely of hero's, a four foot tall Hobbit!J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired to write a beautiful tale of friendship and loyalty in a harsh world of betrayal, death and damnation! With the odds firmly stacked against them, this fellowship of unlikely companions (four Hobbits, two warrior humans. a dwarf, an elf, and an old Wizard called Gandalf) battle the Evil Saruman and his forces of darkness.It is a tribute to this fabulous story that I have not yet mentioned the special effects, which are truly outstanding! Director Peter Jackson has made a wonderful film co-ordinating what was a massive project! Three films made back to back!!!The cast we are all excellent, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins (Our Hobbit hero). I particularily liked Sean Bean as Boromir and Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey!There is not much left to say only **DO NOT MISS THIS FILM** It is the movie experience of the new millennium!! Roll on next Christmas and The Two towers!!One Ring to conquer them all, has been rewritten to one film to conquer them all!!",9,0,0,18 January 2002
Pearl Harbor," Changing the facts and never for the better!!!
","Make no mistake! This is a poor film. I will start by saying the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour is exciting if not accurate in any real historical context. Pearl Harbour doesn't work for the following reasons,
1)  Remember the Japanese Empire attacked at 7am. So how come kids were out playing softball, people were playing golf etc. It was like Sunday afternoon. Corny 2) Poor acting (very poor acting) I cringed in my seat during some of the acting in this movie!! Ben Affleck was terrible, Josh Hartnett was brutal and worse of all was Kate Beckinsale!! Where did these people learn to act!! They were so wooden.  Was it with Keanu Reeves in the `'Pinocchio school of Acting'. Corny as Hell!! 3) The Love Triangle (Less said about that the better) Corny corny corny!!! 4) The sentimentality of this movie!! Was it supposed to make us feel sorry for the Yanks and hate the Japanese!! It totally failed because it was not objective! It was not a balanced view of what really took place. It portrayed events in a one-sided biased manner aimed at American Film goers! Being Irish and not American (and well read on the events of December 3rd) I found the whole movie tiresome, inaccurate and boring! It was a film that was made by Americans, for Americans!This film is not a true depiction of what happened at Pearl Harbour! It is as inaccurate as was Braveheart was with the story of William Wallace. The true story of Pearl Harbour was compelling, moving and dramatic (as was the story of Wallace) so why do Hollywood always insist on changing the facts! And never for the better!!",5,0,1,9 January 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Kill Bill.... I wish someone would..
",Now where do I start?  I am often amazed at the hysteria generated by a movie made by Tarantino.  Granted Pulp Fiction was a decent effort in a confused disjointed way.  But Kill Bill Volume one needs to be taken with an almighty pinch of salt.  If this film was made by Golden Harvest in Hong Kong it would never have seen the light of day in western theatres.I was impressed with the standard of martial arts in the first fight scene when our heroine bride fights to the death against Vernita Green.  But the whole film lost the plot for me after that scene with its chopping backwards and forwards.  And the main fight scene in the nightclub when the bride takes on over 100 screaming samurai welding gangsters beckons belief.I understand this is a tribute to martial art films of the 70's and should in no way be taken seriously but it is possible to have believable martial arts and still have a solid story.  I have always loved Martial arts and I have studied Tae-Kwon-do for many years.  So I guess with a heavy heart I must give this film the thumbs down.,5,3,5,11 August 2004
Enemy at the Gates," impressive
","Enemy at the Gate is the story of two top snipers duel during the WW2 battle at Stalingrad. It is very Realistic, especially the start when the Russians were been ferried across the Volga (The Stuka's attacking the boats is frighteningly realistic.)  Ed Harris is very good as the German sniper (clinical and deadly).   I think they captured the mood of Stalingrad pretty well.  The set of ruined buildings is genuinely impressive.  There is even a short scene with Paulas telling Major Konig that they will all be home for Christmas 1942 (Paulas did not get home until 1955).  The downside to this movie is the love story but it does not interfere with the story too much.",8,0,1,3 April 2001
Ben-Hur," Simply the Greatest epic ever made
","Set in the time of Christ during the height of the mighty Roman Empire, Ben-Hur follows the lives of two former childhood friends Judah Ben Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Steven Boyd), who become the bitterest of enemies. As they grow older, the latter shows unswerving blind loyalty to the Roman Empire. After Ben Hur refuses to help Messala round up what he perceives to be enemies of the Empire, he is framed for a crime he did not commit and is sentenced to a life of living hell on a galley ship as a slave.His blind belief in his fate coupled with a thirst for vengeance helps him to survive this torturous existence. For three years, he is chained to an oar until during a battle with Greek pirates he saves the life of the Roman commander Quintas (Jack Hawkins), who takes Ben-Hur under his wing and frees him from his life of bondage. He becomes the main trainer of Quintas's stables and in the course of time his adopted son and heir. Believing that Massala has killed his mother and sister, Ben-Hur exacts revenge by challenging him to a chariot race.The 40-minute race took three months to shoot, in an arena that was a year in the making, and was one of the most ambitious sets ever staged by a major Hollywood studio.  It forms the focal point of the movie.",10,1,3,5 April 2001
Gladiator," Wonderful Stuff
","What we do now .. echoes through history...A true masterpiece from director Ridley Scott,  Gladiator has everything a epic movie could wish for.  From the battlefields of Germania to the Gladiatorial contests of the coliseum.It stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a brave Roman General who is betrayed by the evil Emperor Commodus.  Left for dead he is rescued by a Gladiator trainer( played by the late Oliver Reed) who trains our hero as a Gladiator. He eventually fights his way to the Coliseum  in Rome when he confronts his enemies and his destinyEverything about this movie echoes pure class.  The battles, the sets, the direction.  The cast is superb especially Russell Crowe, Oliver Reed and our own Richard Harris as the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius.What the author really loved about this film was it's authenticity.  Ridley Scott shows the filmgoer what Rome must have looked like at her height, decadent but wonderful.  This film is a must for anyone who enjoys real entertainment, after all isn't that why cinema was invented.",10,0,0,27 June 2000
