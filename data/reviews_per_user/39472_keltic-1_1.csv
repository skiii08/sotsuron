The Ring," Terrible indeed
","We have the Sixth Sense in our mind. Original plot and a promising start. However the film gets confusing by just adding unconective elements without frame. Good scarry scenes but sometimes a bit on the gore side, and don´t match. Despite the good visual devises and the wise use of light, its usually boring and no effective. The worst thing is that it doesn´t give any explanation of lots of important details, for example why, who and when the video tape was made. Getting with your mind all confused you get to the absurd ending, which is hilarious, strange and doesn´t make any sense. Summarizing the film is pretentious and with only a visual display of effective scenes. Don´t spend your money.",1,0,2,12 January 2003
