The Ring," Pop shock.. not that frightening
","To begin this review, it must be said that I'm not easily frightened by movies, so bear that in mind.  The movie begins with a very pop-horror style setting, reminiscent of the Urban Legends films.  I find that too much time was spent on trying to generate all this suspense through the story of an abused child.. which DOES add to the twist at the end of the flick.  BUT, it seems there was a good amount of filler in this film.  I could have handled a little more gore.  Granted, leaving things to one's imagination can be powerful if delivered with the proper techniques.  But making this move a pg-13 was a bad move for the audience's sake.  Personally, I went to see this flick with my girlfriend hoping for a good scare.  The result was a theatre full of screaming little girls that was louder than the THX surround in the theatre.  I wish film producers would realize that kids can see movies like this when they come out on DVD/Video.  I could only imagine seeing Event Horizon if it was PG-13, I would have been the one saying 'Liberate Me Ex Inferis.' The hell of the screaming 14 yr olds.  Thank god the creators of that film didn't pull any punches.  The movie overall was decent, but the plot was weak, and the scares were few and far between. VERY in your face though.  Hope you all like it more than i did.",Null,0,0,29 October 2002
