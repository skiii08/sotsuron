Come and See," Bravery
","Before watching come and see my professor warned the class to be prepared for a movie that 'you will never forget' and he was right. I know this movie will be imprinted into my mind forever. By engaging all my five senses, I really felt what was happening in the movie. I also mentally prepared myself being warned beforehand that I would see and feel unpleasant things. I saw a totally un-glamorized version of war, which I have never seen before. It makes me proud and thankful for the people in the army for their bravery. Innocent people were being gruesomely killed left and right. I felt as though I was right beside Florya as all these horrible things have been happening. When it said that this was happening to 628 other villages in Russia, it pained me even more that this horrible specific event was happening to villages all around as well. In the midst of all this sadness, Florya and Glashas friendship was delightful to see. They stuck by each other's side and even at the end of the movie when they were separated, Florya thought of his love for Glasha when he saw the raped girl. I wondered how people, like the Nazis could kill people so heartlessly but unfortunately people are killed to this day. People must see this film because it is sure to change your life and make you think.",7,1,1,9 February 2012
