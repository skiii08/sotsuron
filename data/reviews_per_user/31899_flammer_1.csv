Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More, more, more...
","This movie is great! To a Star Wars 'layperson', is almost like reading Tolkien. It is a simple story, simply told, colored with the amazing scenery of fantasy worlds. To the Star Wars savy, it is increadible. Some critics have said the story line was weak compared to the originals. I believe anyone who states this must be taking episodes 4,5 and 6 as a whole. I don't think either of those movies had as much of a story. This movie does a superb job of setting up the next two.  It will be a classic.  In short my only complaint is that Episode II is so far away. Give me more!",10,0,0,17 July 1999
