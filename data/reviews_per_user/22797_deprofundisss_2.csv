Blade Runner 2049," Gratuitous objectification of women hindered the story
","I'm amazed more people aren't commenting on how there was way more purposeless objectification of women in this movie than necessary. We all felt that the gratuitous nudity (always female, of course) was excessive and borderline hilarious. Before you make assumptions, please know that none of us are feminazis, conservatives, or religious, nor do we have issues with nudity when it serves a purpose. This movie had too many objectifying scenes that contributed nothing to the story other than to titillate, as far as we could tell. The storyline was good and intriguing, but the unnecessary degrading treatment of women (well, replicants, but that doesn't make it okay) and the underlying message of females primarily existing just for sex and eye candy really detracted from the experience. Even the guy with us noted this, albeit only after we pointed it out (sigh). All this, in 2017...really? We know better than that.",Null,1,9,7 October 2017
If I Stay," Didn't appreciate it as much until an accidental 2nd viewing
","I thought it was pretty good the first time. To be honest, I was half asleep when I first saw it, to the extent that I didn't realize I had seen it just based on the name of it, so I accidentally started streaming it today without realizing I had seen it before several months ago. I know, this doesn't sound supportive of this movie. For the record, I almost never watch movies more than once...I get too bored. After it started this second time, I did realize immediately that I'd seen it before, but I figured I'd stop it the moment I became bored, which I knew was inevitable given that I'd seen it before. Well, somehow I watched it all again, in its entirety. This time, I saw more depth than I'd seen before. Bottom line, this is worth watching. Of course, it's not perfect, and the main character looks like she's 12 rather than 17 or 18, which is a little bit creepy. But it has heart, and it's beautiful. Granted, I don't totally agree with the ending, but up until then it brought up questions that were very meaningful for anyone who has experienced loss. Kudos to this movie for being unexpectedly watchable for a 2nd run, and for actually being better another time around.",Null,22,28,11 January 2015
