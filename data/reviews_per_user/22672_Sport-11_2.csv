The Blair Witch Project," Interesting concept and at times chilling, but not necessarily scary.
","Well, after reading multiple professional and personal movie reviews and talking to friends that had seen the movie, I am convinced that I knew too much.  Not too much about the movie itself, but too much about how people perceived the movie.  The overwhelming number of people who were scared beyond any previous movie experience had set my expectations souring.  This emotional predisposition, coupled with the scattered facts that I did know about the movie, caused me to be on the edge of my seat before the movie even started.  I loved the concept of the movie, the filming style was creative and left plenty to the imagination and the acting was authentic and believable, but I was left flat on my face when looking to be scared out of my pants.  Again, chilling...yes, scary......not really.",7,0,1,5 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Most creative and creepy 'goosebump' movie in years!
","I am usually one to avoid Bruce Willis movies where he attempts to act.  He has been good in action flicks where he can stumble through with nothing more than the smirk on his face and a blazing gun in his hand.  I can deal with that, but he has tortured me in the past with some poor acting efforts.Well, he was good here.  Some might even say great!  I was thrilled to find that his performance was more than enough to support this wonderfully creative story.  Even more impressive was Haley Joel Osment.  This kid made the movie work and helped to creep me out on several occasions.All in all, this movie finds some new ways to make your skin crawl, make you think a little harder and make your heart hurt.  I loved it and you probably will too.",9,0,0,23 August 1999
