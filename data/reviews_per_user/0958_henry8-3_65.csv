The Avengers," Avengers Assemble
","The characters introduced in the first few MCU movies come together to battle Loki who has stolen the all powerful tesseract and is colluding with space nasties / Thanos to help destroy the Earth.Fabulous action adventure, full of wit and wonder and cleverly managing to continue to build on the various characters we already know plus all giving them enough screen time and something meaningful to do.Dazzling special effects, this may not be the best of the 4 Avengers films, but it is the most fun.",8,0,0,27 July 2019
First Man," First Man
","Biopic of Neil Armstrong from the early Gemini projects to the historic space flight in 1969.The story focusses pretty much exclusively on Armstrong and his wife. He, who never recovered from the death of his only daughter is insular and stubborn and determined, despite the risks to get into space. His wife in turn has to live with his moods and the very real prospect of him not returning. Both Gosling and Foy and very good and should get nods at awards time if there is any justice. The real thrill of the movie though is through the space sequences, which demonstrate perhaps for the first time how terrifying and uncertain these mission were. Oddly enough this applies to earlier tests etc in the film more so than the final Apollo 11 mission, but given the outcome is so well known this is not surprising and filmed accordingly.",7,0,1,25 October 2018

","Tony investigates a fearful terrorist - The Mandarin.Better than 2, this is a good action thriller in its own right which has many excellent set pieces with Downey Jr going head to head with the baddies without the suit until the spectacular climax. Pearce is a good baddie with Kingsley something of a revelation as The Mandarin.",7,1,2,28 July 2019

","Musical starring Edgerton as Elton John that uses his songs to looks back on his life and his later problems with drink, drugs and his sexuality.Edgerton really gets this spot on, giving a truly magnificent performance as the rock legend, with gentler but equally strong supporting turns from Bell and Madden. Unlike its companion piece Bohemian Rhapsody, this pull no punches about the dark side of EJ's life, in fact these feature prominently in the imaginative musical numbers that link his experiences together.",6,0,0,11 May 2020
A Star Is Born," A Star Is Born
","Rock legend Cooper discover Gaga singing La Vie en Rose in a drag bar and takes her under his wing and to his bed. The film charts her rise to power and his descent from it as he increases his drink and drug intake.The performances are a worthy note all around, particularly Gaga, and Elliott who has rarely been better. The story is not new - of course - and prequel knowledge aside, is predictable and whilst Cooper gives a solid turn, his endless mumbling and almost one tone character does become a bit of drag and in turn impacts the emotional resonance which doesn't always land.So a well crafted piece but unoriginal and ultimately somewhat overrated.",5,2,2,2 August 2019
Darkest Hour," Darkest Hour
","Charts a very short time in May 1940 when Churchill had replaced Chamberlain as PM and when appeasement was considered a strong option by many for a world losing to Hitler and which Churchill would not countenance.Fascinating, albeit theatrical face of this small but pivotal piece of history. All the support cast are great as often larger than life but real characters with only James seemingly 'normal'. This of course remains driven by a to die for performance from Oldman (sensational make up) which deservedly won him the Oscar (and everything else).The only bum note is the scene on the underground which is silly and sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise well scripted and paced drama.",6,0,1,14 December 2018
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvel
","Vers (Larson) is on a mission and ends up in Earth where she meets a younger Nick Fury and starts to uncover the truth about her background.Larson and Jackson make for a fun double act and whilst this isn't perhaps as an impressive a first outing as say Captain America or Iron Man, there is much to enjoy with some fun one liners and impressive action sequences.",7,0,2,9 March 2019

",The world knows Stark is Iron Man and the government don't like it and want to take control. Howard Stark's ex partner's son and scientist in his own right (Rourke) wants revenge for his father being left out and Stark's competitor Hammer (Rockwell) recruits Rourke. Meanwhile Stark is dying - his heart gadget won't last and he starts behaving like a idiot accordingly much to the annoyance of love to be Paltrow. Scarlet Johansson puts in her first appearance as Black Widow.This is the synopsis and indeed it is overly complex and baggy compared to the wonderful simplicity of the first one. That said Downey Jr's performance and humour plus some good set pieces still make this a lot of fun. It is though the weakest of the 3 Iron Man films.,6,0,0,21 July 2019
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Forgetting Sarah Marshall
","Segel goes to stay at a Hawaiian hotel to try and get over being dumped by his girlfriend, Bell, only to find she's staying there with new boyfriend Brand. Trying to keep out of her way he falls for receptionist Kunis.Miles better than most other comedies of this type, sensibly providing a fun story, strong characters and a genuinely witty script and avoiding the usual endless 'hilarious' ad libbing. Great supporting cast, particularly Brand, who pretty much steals the show with Segel, who wrote this, making for a funny and very pleasant leading man.",7,0,1,10 February 2019

","Something weird happens to Lupita Nypong'o as a small girl which she never recovered from. Married with 2 children the problem raises its ugly head again and this time she can't avoid it.Unique horror film offering some interesting ideas. It's perhaps a tad too long, but the pace is perfect and the performances, particularly from Nyong'o are really good. Of particular note is the great steam of humour, often quite dark, which permeates this enjoyable offering.",6,0,1,2 April 2019
Knives Out," Knives Out
","Multi millionaire master of mystery thrillers Plummer has killed himself, or has he. Super sleuth Craig is hired by someone to look into the case.Witty and tricky whodunnit - a perfect homage to Agatha Christie with wonderful characters portrayed very well by a stellar cast / not a single bum note performance. A real pleasure to enjoy a rarely seen genre these days, so lovingly pulled together by Johnson.",7,6,14,29 November 2019
The Irishman," The Irishman
","De Niro plays a small time tough guy sponsored by top gangster Pesci. It charts his career with particular emphasis on his relationship with Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa played by Pacino.This is a very fine film indeed and the finesse with which Scorsese brings the story to life with relatively few grandstanding events is hugely impressive. The performances are all great - De Niro carries the picture quite gently as the lead, with Pacino ideally cast in a shouty role and Pesci all nicely understated. Stephen Graham is also excellent in a smaller but key role.The running time at 3 and a half hours is actually pretty painless as you are very rarely not completely absorbed. I think perhaps 15 minutes of trimming might have helped in the final act which seems determined to cover off extraneous detail.",8,2,6,29 November 2019
The Others," The Others
","A woman and her 2 children (husband at war) move to a large dark house, supported by 3 servants. It soon becomes apparent that they are not alone.Very much a slow burner that could have been agonisingly slow if it wasn't for a tour de force and utterly compelling performance by Kidman. Everything is extremely creepy rather than scary with the entire supporting cast all playing their part in keeping it that way.So not for those who prefer their scares jumpy but producing enough judders to ensure it is up there with the best of ghost stories.",6,0,0,16 April 2020
Aquaman," Aquaman
","Aquaman (Mamoa) has to take time out from drinking and bumming around and beat bad guy Wilson to stop him waging war and become king of all things wet. He is ably assisted by Amber Heard.Fun and colourful. Whilst this is not as good as Wonder Woman, it is leagues better (20,000?) than Snyder's dark, grim and rather dull efforts this far. Mamoa and Heard are a good double act and whilst the CGI and hero music is a little over done, there remains plenty to enjoy.",6,2,3,7 September 2019
A Bridge Too Far," A Bridge too Far
","The story of Operation Market Garden where the allies tried to creep into Holland to get to Germany - and the need to hold 9 bridges to achieve this.Christened 'an hour too long' on its original release, this is 3 hours of strategic conversations and battle scenes interspersed with one or two stand alone scenes of some quality - Caan trying to save his buddy, Fox driving past his troops. Attenborough pulled together a quite extraordinary cast, for no apparent reason other than box office drawer with the result that most performance are uninspiring with only Connery, Fox, Hopkins and Bogarde able to have the time to deliver solid turns.Overall unremarkable and not a little dull.",5,4,5,23 February 2019
"I, Tonya"," I, Tonya
","The story of Tonya Harding who despite the staggering naivety of herself and stupidity and spite of her family and friends became a world class skating champion.The scale of comedy and drama tips slightly more towards the dark comedy, which serves to neatly highlight through great performances how ghastly these people were and how appallingly class conscious her American audience and judges behaved. Janney has the best lines and won an Oscar for her crabby mother from hell performance but Robbie and Stan are also wholly convincing as the married couple who couldn't live with or without each other.",6,0,0,6 October 2018
Molly's Game," Molly's Game
","Chastain hires Alba to defend her against prosecution by the FBI for running poker games for the rich, famous and dodgy. The film flashes back to show how she got there.Chastain is absolutely fabulous in the lead, whilst Alba is the heart of the film giving one of his best performances to date. However the usual Sorkin flow of impenetrable poetry / dialogue is the real star.Very enjoyable, albeit could have been tighter on the poker playing which in places can get a little dull.",6,2,4,9 September 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
","Newman and Redford play bank / train robbers of the Wild West pursued by the owners of said banks / trains.Easy to criticise the over romantic view of the Wild West including that song. However the staggering Goldman script, the great chemistry from 2 stars, a lot of laughs and action within a a genuinely beautiful film and many famous scenes has elevated this to legendary status - quite right.",10,0,0,3 May 2020
BlacKkKlansman," BlacKkKlansman
","Amazing true story of a small team of police infiltrating a local klan chapter to try to stop looming violence.Driver is first class as the white undercover presence, with Washington himself oozing presence throughout as the black officer who conceives the plan, runs the show and in a number of hilarious high points gains the respect and trust of the big Klan chief over the phone.Whilst there is arguably room for a little bit of trimming, this remains highly engaging throughout with a great script and fine performances. The amazing trick here is how Lee seems to very cleverly shift from laugh out loud comedy to troubling sometimes fairly intense scene and back without missing a beat.",7,27,33,31 August 2018
The Way Back," The Way Back
","A group of gulag prisoners escape from a Siberian camp and walk 4,000 miles to safety in India.A pretty much linear tale following a small group across tundra, desert and mountains and the terrible hardships they must face. This is told as you might expect from the brilliant Peter Weir, with his typical atmospheric touch and wonderful story telling gift. Leanesque in scope it is often exciting and sometimes moving, particularly in the desert scenes with some good performances with Farrell the only slightly misplaced note.A good, solid, but not actually great adventure then with much to enjoy.",7,0,0,25 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
","So, after 9 films, the saga ends and the difficulty facing Abrams is how to neatly tie everything up when Rian Johnson went slightly off piste with the previous film The Last Jedi, which was disliked by many SW fabs who wanted something different as long as it was the same as A New Hope. What he does then is to largely ignore it and instead create a sequel to his first effort, the popular The Force Awakens.To do this though he has to cram a lot of action and story devises into a short space of time and what you get us some hugely impressive set pieces and a rather messy storyline which is created so he can shut this down neatly. The notion of Palpatine being alive is fun but daft, there is a spy within the First Order which is predictable, but again silly and much of the rest of the plot is Rey and Ren coming face to face fighting the dark side / light side as is a Jedi's want. All this is done whilst in the background the rest of the cast do all the heroic stuff - dog fights, big action scenes etc.Overall then there is much to criticise and undoubtedly there is room for improvement, but it is still a very impressive, spectacular watch, Ridley and Driver are good value, it's nice to see McDiarmid again and the handling of the late Carrie Fisher's scene's are well done. For all it's faults, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",7,1,8,21 December 2019
Captain America: The First Avenger," Captain America: The First Avenger
","Baddie Weaving wants to defy Hitler and take over the world after finding the all powerful tesseract, ably supported by fellow nut Jones. Meanwhile weedy wannabe soldier Evans undertakes a experiment designed by scientist Tucci and turns into our hero.Nice start to the Captain America element of the MCU taking Evans through his traditional comic book hero of WW2 battling evil Weaving whilst the romantic element which will be so important going forward is well managed.",7,1,1,28 June 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Bohemian Rhapsody
","Tells the story of Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury from teenage years to the Live Aid concert.For the most part this is a largely well made though unsurprising biopic that certainly steers clear of too much controversy. That said the sections featuring performance are the best put to film and are both exciting and moving. Malek is excellent in the lead, rather overshadowing the so so supporting cast.",6,0,0,20 September 2019
Bird Box," Bird Box
","Bullock and 2 young children set off down a river to sanctuary, blindfolded, because you'll commit suicide if you see the dark malevolent force that has infected the planet.Swapping between the river trip and how it all started 5 years ago, this is a really tense and sometimes almost unbearably hard to watch chiller. The force is never explained or seen - definitely for the better - but remains a frightening presence throughout. The cast are terrific, but Bullock is something else, delivering a stonking performance which not since Sigourney Weaver as Ripley has so well combined vulnerability and toughness. This is particularly moving in her relationship with the children where she pulls no punches in her treatment of them to keep them both alive.There are definitely a few plot holes which needed tidying up, but this is definitely one to catch. It never lets go, keeps you longing for a happy ending (I won't say) and finally leaves you exhausted.",7,1,4,23 December 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
","A young boy gets bitten by a spider and becomes another Spider-Man. Shadowing an evil plan which could destroy the world, he comes across other Spidermen from other dimensions which the machine of such destruction bring into his world. They work together to save the day.Quite astonishing animation propels you into something you are not prepared for - a dazzling colourful spectacle with hugely enjoyable characters. It has tremendous charm and is both genuinely funny and frequently touching, particular in putting across his relationship with his father. The spectacular ending is possibly a little excessive in a Jackson Pollock sort of way and indeed a tad too long, but this is a small quibble in an otherwise enjoyable romp - definitely one to catch.",7,1,1,11 August 2019
Van Helsing," Van Helsing
","Van Helsing (Jackman) is employed by the Vatican to eliminate all non humans, monsters etc. He must now go and get Count Dracula.Quite a lot of fun to be had here with the hero and Beckinsale taking on the Count and his minions with werewolves and the Frankenstein monster thrown in for good measure. Subtle it ain't though and with little in the way of story - essentially 2 hours of action packed set pieces.",5,1,1,9 April 2020
Yesterday," Yesterday
","Failed song writer and performer Patel wakes up from a global incident, apparently the only person who has heard of The Beatles. He goes on to find worldwide success releasing / performing The Beatles songs - but at what cost.Enjoyable idea is rather wasted in a slight tale that is neither as much fun as it could have been or very moving. Patel's central performance is adequate for a dull rather annoying role and it it is left to Lily James to add any real heft to the proceedings.Nice to hear the great tunes again, but overall something of a missed opportunity.",4,0,1,19 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Avenger Still: Endgame
","Picks up 22 days after the climax of Infinity War with Iron Man and Nebula stranded in space and the others baffled as to what to do next. Antman re-emerges and they consider a new possible way forward.Fabulous conclusion, full of wit, sadness and wonder. Everyone is great, the effects are to die for and a very well produced line is drawn under phase 3 - let's hope phase 4 is half as good.",9,5,12,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4
","Bonnie makes 'Sporky' at her first day at kindergarten and it becomes her favourite toy. On a family road trip, Sporky gets lost and Woody sets out to put things right.The film has all the charm, wit and life lessons of the others, but remains a film of 2 parts. The first half seems a tad messy with little in the way of prime story telling, whilst the 2nd half is as good as any of the other films. Quite whether a 4th film was really necessary given the existence of the complete and loved trilogy is debatable, but there's much to enjoy here and the ending is worth the waist - divine and absolutely right.",6,0,0,29 February 2020
The Pianist," The Pianist
","Follows a Jewish pianist (Brody) trying to survive in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2.A film broadly of 2 parts, the first covering the arrival of the nazis and its impact on the Jewish community most particularly Brody and his family. This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people. Brody is very good in the lead and overall it is a considerable achievement - important to be sure. I just found that some passages took long to make their point - sorry.",6,0,0,5 May 2020
The Favourite," The Favourite
","Queen Anne (Coleman) is ill and ineffective and so Lady Sarah (Weitz) essentially manages queen and country. That is until Abigail, a lady on hard times but with ambitions, arrives at the palace to compete with Sarah for the top spot.It is just so refreshing to see something so original, that is so near to a bizarre art house movie but remains so hugely accessible to us simple folk. The camera work and lighting is deeply strange but somehow seems right, the script is wonderful, with the humour jet black and laugh out loud funny and the supporting cast particularly Hoult all over the top but great fun. Key to all this though is the 3 leads. Weitz's role as the power behind the throne is the least flamboyant of the 3 but she is great in it demonstrating a determined and scary strength throughout. Stone's character is the real cornerstone of the plot and she's clearly having a whale of a time conning her way to the top. Finally there is Coleman as the queen, a women of power and a wrecked life, unable to rule anything. Coleman mixes sweetness and madness effortlessly whilst at the same time giving us most of big laughs - a superb performance.This is not for everyone and not for maiden aunts as they say - 'Victoria' it ain't, several people walked out of the screening I went to after 20 minutes leaving the rest of us to soak it all up and enjoy the razor sharp wit.",8,3,4,3 January 2019
Revolutionary Road," Revolutionary Road
","Winslet and DiCaprio are a couple in a difficult marriage and decide to start again by moving to Paris - but complications follow.Excellent performances from the 2 leads, which sheds light on the differing emotional approaches of men and women to a crumbling marriage. Winslet seems more assured in her role whilst DiCaprio strays into melodrama occasionally, but this is a minor quibble.Good support from Bates, the local friend who can't cope with such emotion, Shannon as her disturbed son who tells it as it is and Harbour, who adores Winslet from afar.This is a very hard watch, made up in the main by long and highly dramatic and caustic arguments between the leads and you therefore need to be in a particular mood to truly 'enjoy' this. Impressive acting, but very hard work - A Marriage Story is better.",5,0,1,4 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time in Hollywood
","Di Caprio plays a film star on the wane with Pitt his long time stunt double and friend. The films follows their lives of auditions, making tv shows and getting involved in general Tarantinoesque incidents over a few days in 1969. Di Caprio's neighbours are Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate (Robbie) and Tate's contented existence is followed simultaneously.A hugely rich, touching and often hilarious passing of time with 2 wonderful characters both played brilliantly by the leads. It's hard to pin down how something which could so easily have been mistimed and plain boring works so well, but Tarantino's most natural work to date just serves to evidence what a fine story teller and great film maker he is. Special mention for Robbie who has a very difficult role of the seemingly ever smiling happy Tate who says very little, but wins us over with a well crafted persona.Note - may require several views to really enjoy thie complexities Tarantino has brought to the screen.",8,10,21,20 August 2019
Aladdin," Aladdin
","Live action remake of the Disney hit, diamond in the ruff thief, Aladdin is smitten with the local princess and with the help of the genie of the lamp (Will Smith) he makes his moves much to the chagrin of ambitious baddie Jafar.Extremely colourful and an on the whole fun adventure for all the family, this is hampered by questionable casting. Smith is enjoyable as the genie, but inevitably is in the shadow of the original Robin Williams and often looks a shade uncomfortable throughout. Massoud and Scott are fine if unremarkable, whilst Kenzari as Jafar is just deadly dull and is not the pantomime menace he is supposed to be.Fun enough with Aladdin entering the city as Prince Ali the highlight.",5,1,2,21 January 2020
The Lion King," The Lion King
","Lion cub and king in waiting Simba feels responsible for the death of his father King Moustafa and runs away to learn about life.There is no arguing with the amazing animation, but this, more than any other film, just smells like an excuse to print money for Disney. It is pretty much a direct remake of a film from not that long ago and therefore has a feel of relative pointlessness.Well enough acted out and one or two genuinely funny lines, this isn't a bad film I'm just not sure the point of it.",5,1,3,9 May 2020
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place
","Blunt and Krasinski live with their children in isolation in world where monsters will kill anything they can hear - they can't see. So the trick of this largely silent movie is the slightest noise puts them in danger.So whilst this is well put together and often extremely tense it remains a bit of a one trick pony. If you can accept the narrow bandwidth of this concept you are likely to enjoy this admittedly original idea - if not and like me, you'd have preferred it to move in a few more different directions it may disappoint. Clever idea though.",5,1,1,27 January 2019
Men in Black II," What a waste of time!
","I remember Barry Sonnenfield being interviewed after MIB 1 saying from a financial and logistical point of view no 11 could never happen, what a shame it did. Not a truly awful movie, Smith is fine(ish) & Lee Jones continues with the MIB 1/Fugitive character that has kept him going through all these years - the script isn't remotely funny, Jack Nicholson's ex is rather dull and Rip Torn looks vaguely embarrassed - presumably until he read the pay cheque. All in all it's just so disappointing, the novelty has worn off entirely - all that noisy cricket waffle etc and frankly the money could have been better spent on decorating a small country in Africa.",4,1,2,25 January 2005

","In WW1, 2 soldiers are sent to warn a Colonel across enemy lines not to advance as it's a trap.Apparently filmed in one continuous shot - the camera certainly never leaves the leads' sides - this is unquestionably a towering technical achievement but this close up of our heroes throughout the 2 hours is the problem, in that you yearn to look elsewhere. In addition, the story can only progress through the characters and situations they come across, hence the effect, however touching, is that of chapters in a video game. So much to admire rather than like here, it sets an interesting new approach to story telling, I'm just not convinced that the talent on display or the story stand a chance against all the technical cleverness and trickery.",6,8,21,10 January 2020

","Following a family tragedy, Pugh, her boyfriend Reynor and his mates visit a commune in Sweden who are celebrating a special festival. They soon discover that it is not as much fun as they thought it was going to be.Whilst there are undoubtedly a couple of shocks and distressing scenes, whether you buy into this depends on your acceptance of the various behaviours and rituals that make up most of the film. For the most part I found them rather silly and grew tired of 100 people dressed in white and flowers singing Kumbaya and eating endless meals very slowly. Pugh just about holds it together, but even she seems lost towards the ending which is hardly a shock.Just not scary - watch The Wicker Man again instead.",4,3,5,11 March 2020
The King," The King
","The story of Henry V, from inheriting the crown from his father to his famous victory at Agincourt.An often stirring, thoughtful and very serious telling of the tale which focusses predominantly on the strategies and smarts needed by the young king to get him through war with France and to understand the political necessities to be supreme ruler.The cast are excellent with particularly Harris as Henry's principal advisor and Edgerton as an enjoyable, albeit less comic than usual, Falstaff edging ahead. Chalamet is the tricky one and whilst he is a terrific actor and performs a great turn as Henry, occasionally it seems an uncomfortable fit.There is little to take issue with however. Edgerton's script is fine if a little flowery in places and fun though Pattinson is as the Dauphin, he seems as if he's auditioning for a Bond villain role.The film twists and turns quite nicely and is often quite violent, but overall it's a great tale, beautiful to look at and well told.",7,1,5,3 November 2019

","After years of hearing of bannings, prosecutions and general banter about what a masterpiece this was, I finally got around to seeing this.  I had, I'm afraid, like most others not studied in great depth the life of Pasolini and what drove this man to make this movie, so I can only comment as an ill-informed viewer. Whilst there is no case these days for banning this work, as a keen movie fan, who has enjoyed other Pasolini films, I'm glad I've put this behind me. I'm sure there are acres of important messages here which I've missed, but all I came away with was a feeling of revulsion,(which no doubt is the point), and plain disappointment.  Heresy, I know, but I just can't help feeling that Pasolini enjoyed doing this sort of daft muck in the name of high art rather too much.  Apologies from an ordinary film fan then - but then again I suppose this wasn't intended for ordinary viewers.",3,2,6,28 November 2001

","Modern take on the HG Wells classic with irresponsible dad Cruise trying to get his son and daughter to safety away from the Tripods.Spielberg has created his darkest fantasy feature with a strong sense of dread throughout with the superbly realised Tripods genuinely unnerving. Cruise is solid in the lead but acting chops goes to young Dakota Fanning and a brief but compelling turn by Tim Robbins. There are so many great scenes which add real discomfort to proceedings particularly the ferry scene, the piece with Robbins and Cruise's dreadful dilemma when his son wants to see the creatures.The only bum note is the attitude of Cruise's son, which doesn't quite chime - but a fine film.",7,0,1,25 April 2020

Starting with personal failures and challenges, the character (Phoenix), through an act of violence inadvertently causes social change that slowly but surely brings things to their inevitable explosive and violent conclusion.Often slow and very intense, but never boring, the whole, beautifully filmed exercise completely revolves around Phoenix and his extraordinary performance. A unique film to be sure and one to watch - but not a little troubling.",7,8,19,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It Chapter Teo
","27 years later, the kids from 'It' have grown up. Mike, the only member of The Losers who stayed in Derry invokes their oath to return to Derry if Pennywise the Clown returns - which of course he does.This is a film whose total does not equal the sum of its parts. The adult characters spend a vast chunk of running time coming back together, deciding whether they should stay and then revisiting what Pennywise did to them. This is well structured but is just too long, although to be fair so was the book.The performances are pretty solid, particularly Hader, whilst Chastain rather disappoints as she fails to bring the Beverley from the first film to life. Lots of spectacular horror scenes and Scarsgard still menacing as the clown, doesn't compensate for a disappointing and overlong sequel.",5,4,7,6 September 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Oie Society
","Writer Lily James sets off to meet the members of the society, bought together during the WWII occupation of the island. There she finds they share a secret which she slowly pieces together whilst falling in love with them all and one in particular.An enjoyable, very English piece with a good cast - particular I'd note, the wonderful Katherine Parkinson. The society members make good company and whilst the nazi threat in flashbacks is a little underplayed and James's fiancÃ© written as too much the cad to strike a real romantic dilemma for James, overall it makes for a pleasant couple of hours.",6,2,2,27 December 2018

","True story of a fighting special unit sent into Afghanistan after 9/11 to attack the Taliban. To achieve this they must forge an alliance with local tribes. Hemsworth plays the special forces captain.Whilst there is plenty of action to enjoy, which is excitingly played out, more than that this is an interesting piece of strategic modern history following this special forces team on an impossible mission, which has only recently been made public.Good to see Hemsworth can carry a film outside of the MCU and it's a well pulled together into a solid if unremarkable piece.",5,1,4,20 August 2019
Parasite," Parasite
","A poor street savvy family trick their way into taking on various roles working for a very rich family. The con works well until an unexpected turn of events leaves them in danger of being found out.Extraordinarily absorbing film which manages to combine societal messages with high drama and laugh out loud comedy. All the characters in both families are a pleasure to be with - there are no villains here - and you just sit back and enjoy a well scripted journey in the certain knowledge that it's going to end in tears. The sets and the set pieces (the storm, the piece under the table etc) are superbly structured and the main house begins to feel like a genuine home. A lingering, audacious masterpiece",8,3,6,15 February 2020
Marriage Story," Marriage Story
","Driver and Johanssen are a married couple who are divorcing - the film charts the impact upon them and how they will manage custody of their young son.This is not light entertainment and you need to be in a receptive mood to fully appreciate it. If you are, this is a touching and wrenching tale of the emotionally draining experience divorce can undoubtedly be - particularly via the California legal system. What is most affecting and impressive is the utterly compelling performances by both leads who both deserve at least Oscar nods.Driver singing Being Alive near the end is a sensation.",7,0,4,9 December 2019
Iron Man," Iron Man
","Zillionaire and creator of ever more deadly weapons, Tony Stark (Downey Jr) is captured in Afghanistan and forced to create a missile for the enemy. Instead he carries out a daring escape and returns to civilisation where he radically rethinks his priorities, much to the chagrin of company exec Bridges.Downey's first outing as Iron Man and the first film produced for the MCU is great fun. There a lot going on here and the script supporting this provides tension, wit and intelligence. The cast are all on top form but it is Downey Jr's creation of Stark moving from greedy, carefree playboy to superhero and philanthropist that is the real pulling power here and which lead to another 22 MCU films and counting.",7,0,0,21 July 2019
The Greatest Showman," The Greatest Showman
","Young boy PT Barnum dreams of success and grows up to be Hugh Jackman, creates a circus, gets lost on life's highway when dazzled by a beautiful and talented opera singer, but finds his true self in the end - that's it.The story is very slight and predictable, but that's scarcely the point with a film over flowing with belt 'em out show tunes which all sound like 'Let it Go'. I will admit to rather disliking it to start with, but it sort of grows on you and you find yourself at the end wanting to go back and see (hear) it again, just to be absolutely sure it really wasn't rubbish after all.",6,0,0,14 December 2018

","Emmet Ray (Penn) is a famous 30s Jazz guitarist with little regard for anyone else. He meets Samantha Morton, a mute girl who falls in love with him.Oozing immense charm, this is a small, gentle film made all the more watchable by the 2 lead performances. Ray is not a particularly likeable character but Penn somehow makes him attractive and fun to watch with Morton giving a tour de force show stealing performance, without of course any dialogue.Very sweet.",6,0,0,4 March 2020

","Anna Kendrick and the girls go on a USO tour and enter the usual competitions.A tight, witty script, laugh out loud scenes, fine performances including a standout turn by John Lithgow - this has none of these. The script must have taken a whole afternoon to write and quite what Lithgow thinks he was doing is bewildering. Nothing approaching a plot happens and I didn't even smile once. The music is nice, but otherwise a truly dreadful film.",2,1,2,9 April 2019
Jojo Rabbit," JoJo Rabbit
","Griffin Davis plays a confused member of the Nazi youth guided through his life by an imaginary Hitler played by Taika Waititi. His views and life are challenged when he discovers that his mother (Johansson) has been keeping a young Jewish girl hidden in their house.Really difficult to pin this one down. It could have so easily been unfunny, even extremely tasteless. What it in fact delivers is an often hilarious comedy with some supremely touching even harrowing scenes. Waititi's script is hysterical with many glorious one liners delivered by a particularly fine cast. Johansson has rarely been better and is totally convincing as the loving German mother, whilst young Griffin Davis gives the best child actor turn since Jacob Tremblay in Room. The supporting cast are also integral to the humour with Rockwell fine as the German captain who likes the strange boy, Merchant hilarious and sinister as the local Gestapo head and best of all Archie Yates as the boy's best friend.Not for everyone to be sure, but a terrific film destined for cult following.",8,2,6,3 January 2020

","After Avengers' Assemble, Loki is in prison on Asgard and Thor is trying to rebuild alliances with the nine realms. Meanwhile, evil Eccleston is after the evil red mist / force that is the Aether (the reality stone in another form) and Portman on earth soon gets caught up in this. Things converge.Probably the weakest of the MCU films largely because the plot is a bit baggy, Eccleston as written has zero personality and the Portman / Hemsworth passion play continues to fail to convince. On the positive side it's great fun, the usual dazzling effects and creatures are here and Hiddleston as Loki nearly steals this film as well.So worth seeing, just a bit of a mess. First post credit is worth hanging around for.",6,0,0,30 July 2019
Green Book," Green Book
","Classical pianist Ali hires street wise tough guy Mortensen to drive him to all his concerts in the south of the USA where racism is rife and trouble somewhat inevitable.Whilst the racist incidents are laid on thick and fast, there is no getting around the gentle pleasure of these 2 actors bouncing off and learning from each other as the road trip progresses. Both give great performances and there is much to laugh and cry about in this film. That all said the notion of it winning the best picture Oscar is absurd.",7,2,4,15 September 2019

","4 black ex Vietnam soldiers go back to find the body of their lost comrade and a pile of gold.After a decent enough first half hour where you get to the know the individuals, their problems and their feelings about the war and their beloved fallen comrade this decends into a really badly put together Treasure of the Sierra Madre rip off. Full of over the top characters and silly speeches linked in with Lee's usual messages, this would have been acceptable had it not been for the structure of the hunt for the body / gold adventure which is totally unbelievable and gets worse and worse as the film progresses. Redeemed very slightly in the last 20 minutes, it remains a misguided and annoying mess.",3,9,13,24 June 2020

","Super heroes are illegal, but a huge conglomerate run by a very rich man and his sister comes to the Incredibles rescue by promoting specifically the talents of Elastagirl.Wonderful animation and impressive set pieces do not entirely hide that this isn't as much fun as the first one. Everyone does their stuff perfectly well, but laughs are few and far between and it just doesn't quite live up to its promise. Shame.",5,2,4,5 September 2019

","Hoult is a zombie who falls in love with Palmer. Malkovich her father is the leader of the gun toting zombie slayers.Well handled, straightforward fun attempt to play with the zombie story which works pretty well.
