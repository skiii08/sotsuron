Hereditary," A solid film with a silly ending
","I went to an early morning showing of this movie on my own, so was in a patient and alert mood as I watched. It is slow, creepy and at one point utterly shocking. I can see how others may have found it boring though. I may have at another time. As it was, I really enjoyed the acting, the unusual plotting and the general atmosphere. As the end approached I lost interest in the mystery and didn't really care what was happening. The last scenes seemed silly and unnecessary. Overall though, it is not a bad movie.",7,0,1,24 August 2018
