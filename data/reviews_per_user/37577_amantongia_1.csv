Airlift," No Indian should miss out on this
","Excellent movie.The best movie of akshay kumar by far.It brings out the Indian in you.A story of evacuation of 2 lakh people led by one man is not easy to direct,but this was directed with shear perfection.The songs were heart touching and bring out tears from your eyes.It is a perfect family thriller which does not let you take your eyes off for a moment.It is entertaining,gripping,touching and all the good words you can think in this world.The relations have been brilliantly shown,be it the father daughter relationship, a husband wife relationship and yes a country and her relationship with her children.Its a movie worth your money.No Indian should miss out on this.And yes,you might want to take a tissue with you.Jai Hind,Jai Bharat.!!!",10,0,1,19 February 2016
