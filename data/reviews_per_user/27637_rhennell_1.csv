Blade Runner 2049," Good but flawed
","A great sequel with the atmosphere,quality fx and sounds of the original but there are 2 issues.Firstly you need to watch the original which is great, I didn't realise how much of this film is linked to the original. The film looks and sounds fantastic. My issues are firstly with K's holographic assistant Joi, she features a lot in the film but why? She looks stunning but doesn't bring much to the film, some scenes with her are too long. She is basically a very advanced Siri or Amazon Echo, a lifelike companion but I don't think she is needed that much in the film.This brings me to the main issue and the reason why, I believe, the film maybe hasn't done too well commercially - it's too long! The film needs 15 minutes taken out, some scenes go on way too long without bringing anything more to the film and it feels, by the end, that the film should have finished earlier. There are at least 5 scenes which can be trimmed without spoiling it. On the whole, well worth a watch, some nice cameos, great atmosphere, decent acting but a little too long.",7,1,5,14 October 2017
