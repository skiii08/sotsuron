Walk the Line," The music is the highpoint
","The best part, IMHO, was the music. I particularly enjoyed the way that Joaquin Phoenix's vocals matured over the course of the film - he did a good job evoking Johnny Cash's distinctive style without resorting to cheap imitation. And Reese Witherspoon was delightful, particularly singing 'Jackson'.The performances, particularly Reese Witherspoon as June Carter, were compelling and believable. Reese captured June's liveliness and humor beautifully as well as her vulnerability - the warmth with which she responded to any approach by a fan really struck me.While I enjoyed the movie a great deal, it didn't break any ground in the biopic genre, Daddy issues, survivor guilt, repeating the bad parenting cycle, fame leading to bad behavior, redemption - sure, it's all true, but it would have been nice to see it play out a little less predictably. I also would have been interested in seeing more of the importance that religion played in Johnny Cash's life, as well as the role of Mother Maybelle in his recovery - Cash often credited her with his salvation.",8,0,3,27 November 2005
