Hereditary," I dint expect something so good
","We saw the movie in Athens at an open summer cinema and i am glad for that because when the movie put as under pressure at list who had the stars to look ..... i have to see such a powerful director debut from Tarantinos-Reservoir dogs and coen-Blood Simple.Is a movie that stucks with you days after you seen it,if you like this genre go and see it",9,23,52,17 June 2018

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," I KNOW IT'S FUNNY BUT THE LAST JEDI WAS BETTER
","I saw the movie in Greece two hours ago ,it has only 3-4 scenes that i really liked,the 5 second scene where the brothers are young is epic ,let them play that scene at an endless loop over and over again,but its only five seconds, all the other movie it felt rush and childsh , really poor script it felt they want to moved on very quickly without explanation about anything, things are going too hurriedly as if they want to end this bad trilogy and move on further, ...i am very sad that I'm telling that but its obvious that they made this trilogy only for marketing purposes ... such a same ,i don't know how they are going to fix the franchise after this,the amount you like a movie looks and from how many times you want to see it again at the future, and i'm not looking to see the force awakens or the last jedi unlike the original trilogy i see it almost every year with joy, finally the only good thing about the revival of the Star Wars it was the rouge one and the Mandalorian, better from nothing",2,81,182,19 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," PLEASE give us the Secret Wars...with all the marvel heroes
","I did not expect to see in my life such a faithful rendition of my childhood heroes from the comics to the big screen ... the emotions was huge ... the only reason I kept and did not cry in the cinema was because I was shy not to see me ... . From Athens Greece Thank you STAN LEE for filling my childhood with those fantastic stories and heroes ,also Russo and marvel because you have respected our comic heroes on the big screen ... my only sadness is that we could not see avengers together with XMEN- fantastic four -Daredevil in the same movie, but you can not have it all at life",10,11,32,25 April 2019

Joker," OUAAOU JOKER IS THE REALL HERO
","A really good movie about a superhero ohh sorry super villain i mean ,the performance of Joaquin Phoenix overshadows all the others , great work from him,Gotham has great similarities with our world unemployment, poverty ,social inequality ,and the Joker in this general mess appears as a hero of the oppressed, and it really makes sense as he comes out of them, the joker certainly has great mental disorders but the oppression he receives amidst this unjust living community that eventually leads him to the Big Bang, who is the hero finally Batman or the Joker? I'm sorry but in this movie the Joker won the battle",10,1,6,11 October 2019
