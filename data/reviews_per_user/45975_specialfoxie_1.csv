The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Awful, boring, nonsense
","I never normally write reviews, but this film was so terrible that I need it brought to justice.I have wanted to watch the Twilight Saga for a while, but never been able to bring myself to do it in fear of the embarrassment that would come with discussing it amongst friends.I'm obviously not the target demographic for these films and never went into this challenge expecting them to be good. However, this film might unironically be the worst movie I have ever seen. The pacing is horrendous, acting more like a filler episode of a T.V series. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is unrealistic, over the top and shallow given how the main relationship falls flat.The movie also had some strange subtext that felt very pro-life / anti-abortion. I cannot prove this is what the writer intended, but they use telepathy to 'communicate' with the fetus and intentionally show how it has feelings and emotion. Very creepy, strange writing decision.The only potentially good scene in the whole film is when the wolf pack are meeting and it is ruined by catastrophically implemented ADR which just makes the whole thing confusing to watch.The character building in this franchise is poor, but this film takes the cake for inconsistencies. One character seems to have a completely different mindset from the previous film and decides to stick with Bella even though he wanted to kill her a few scenes before? They explain it away with a gimmic called imprinting, which is also another creepy aspect of this film.I have just watched the film and I already cannot recall how they managed to fill two hours. What a waste of an evening.",1,0,0,5 May 2020
