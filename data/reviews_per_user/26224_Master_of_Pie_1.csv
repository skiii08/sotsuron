Resident Evil: Afterlife," Paul Anderson insults us and RE fans once again!!!
","First, I must say, that i'm no hardcore Resident Evil fan, i've only ever played RE:5 and was impressed. I didn't mind the films either. I thought they were OK. I went to see this one, with no expectations, but also hoping Anderson cracked the Resident Evil formula. However, I was wrong, so so wrong. I'd hate to spoil some things, but this movie is so bad there's nothing to spoil.Let's start with the plot. Alice (Milla Jovovich) wants to destroy the Umbrella corporation. Why? I don't know. It opens with an action scene which is like a scene from the matrix, except really bad. There are so many slow-mo shots in the film I feel the movie is shot in another dimension. I saw the movie in 3D, and it's awful, there's actually nothing 3D in the movie, so save your money. Our Villain, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) is actually more likable than Alice. He looks intimidating and those 2 Desert Eagles back that up. Alice is a boring character, she spends most of her time firing SMGs that somehow never need to be reloaded. At other times, she's filming audio logs as if they're trying to rip off Avatar all of a sudden, that continues to prove she just can't act. Im not sure how to explain this movie. Basically she finds survivors in an abandoned Asylum like Dawn of the Dead (I know they were in a shopping mall) where zombies can't get in. The zombies are better this time, RE:5 has inspired them with the parasite in their mouths and the evil dogs at the end of the movie. The executioner with the giant Axe-hammer is a welcome addition as well. It's such a shame they don't kill Alice. Wentworth Miller is a welcome addition as Chris Redfield. Other than Claire Refdfield (Ali Larter) and Wesker, he's the only thing to do with Resident Evil in this movie. I could go on all day hating this movie. Chris looks tough, and even fights like Chris in the games. Trust me when I say if you're a RE fan, the scene where Chris and Claire get owned by Wesker is the highlight of the movie. I won't go any further on the details of this movie, because i'll probably vent my rage so much, a volcano will erupt.I'll end by saying this is a pain to sit through, the special effects will give you a headache even if you don't see it in 3D. The acting other than Chris and Wesker is just terrible, and worst of all, it ends on a cliffhanger. Sorry Anderson, that's one movie I won't be seeing.Well Paul Anderson, I bet you enjoying insulting humanity with this movie. I will just say the only redeeming factor of this movie is the fight scene involving Wesker, Chris and Claire. Everything else is crap. Also one word of warning folks, Anderson's next big film is going to be a movie adaptation of 'Castlevania' my favorite game franchise. I think i'm going to kill myself if he makes that terrible. Thanks for reading my first review on this site, If you have any recommendations on how I can improve, please email me, I can only improve with feedback. Thanks, and DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!",1,0,3,25 October 2010
