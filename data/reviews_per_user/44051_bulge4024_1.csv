The Expendables 2," Utter Rubbish
","I'm an eighties kid. So it's fair to say I love every single actor in this as iv grown up with them. But what a bad film!! Possibly the worst script ever combined with great special effects and stupid far fetched battle scenes. I think that sums it up. One to watch when bored. I'm not hating on the actors, in fact I loved the cast, it's just seriously come on! Do they actually watch the film after they've shot it and think 'yea! That's a great film' Or do they just take the pay check and forget about it.",1,94,166,3 October 2012
