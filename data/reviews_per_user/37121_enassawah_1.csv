Ford v Ferrari," My review of the movie
","The movie was hust great
I was in an awe of the way both christian bale and matt damon portrayed the charred
It was a balanced mix of action, drama, and comedy
The driving scenes were breath taking as wellI can say i just enjoyed each and every minute of it",10,2,3,30 November 2019
