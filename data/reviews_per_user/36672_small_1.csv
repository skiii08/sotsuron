Ali," Not what we had hoped for
","The trailers were great, but the movie lacked any luster.  Will Smith is believable as Ali, but the film had little substance.  There are numerous scenes where the camera just stares at Ali or he stares as events unfold around him.  Too much contemplation.  You see him rise and fall, but the movie closes too early in his life.  It does, however, provide a good feel for his beliefs, convictions and personality.  I rated it a 5 out of 10.",5,0,0,30 December 2001
