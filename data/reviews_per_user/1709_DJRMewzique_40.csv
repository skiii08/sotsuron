The Avengers," Far from perfect, but the perfect start to a blockbuster summer.
","Guaranteed to be one of the biggest films of the year, is 'The Avengers' going to be one of the best? Well, no, probably not. But with the biggest opening weekend in North American history, I am sure no one cares.After years of Marvel entries, introducing us to the upgraded versions of the likes of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and (in an unfortunate turn) the Hulk, it was all culminating to this: The Avengers...where all these guys come together, along with Nick Fury, Black Widow and Hawkeye (who?).With such a long wait, was the anticipation worth it? Well, sure...I think so! Not being a huge comic geek, I thought the film was thoroughly entertaining. It was fast-paced, action-packed and the writing was good, punchy and terribly funny. To be honest, there could not have been a better choice of film to officially kick-off the 2012 mindless blockbuster season! But is the film itself perfect? No. Far from it. There are lulls in the action that could have been slightly edited. There are jumps in the story that may not be noticed by a fan of the comics that are in the know but leave non-fans scratching their heads a little. And most importantly, there are scenes where the special effects are (ack!) off, and the use of CGI is really noticeable. Really noticeable In a film like 'The Avengers,' and their $220 million budget, the effects should be absolutely flawless, and the end result here is far from the truth.And the Hulk being 100% CGI is only part of the problem.With a film of this calibre, the one thing that should be absolutely perfect is the special effects.So yes, Robert Downey Jr. does as good a job as ever, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans are just as expected (although we were robbed of at least one shirtless scene each), Jackson is slightly less intimidating than Fury actually should be, Scarlett Johansson is pretty, Jeremy Renner was alright as whoever Hawkeye is while Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly great as Dr. Banner. Really noteworthy? HIMYM's Cobie Smulders and the return of Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson.And yes, Joss Whedon was certainly the man to helm this film, and there is no doubt that I will be first in line for the two eventual sequels.But no, the film is not perfect. If I had a word of advice for the next instalment: the CGI should be flawless and if you're going to release it in 3D, make the 3D pop, or don't bother doing it at all.But, again, yes, overall, 'The Avengers' kick starts the summer in grand style. But there is no doubt that I am still looking more forward to 'Prometheus' and 'Dark Knight Rises,' both of which, I have a feeling, will be much higher quality films. But neither will be nearly this much fun.",8,2,6,6 May 2012
Angels & Demons," The best aspect of this film is the light it shines on a corrupt church.
","To be honest, there is not much to say about 'Angels and Demons' in terms of the film itself. Based on the Dan Brown book of the same name, the follow-up to 'The DaVinci Code' is a fine action film that throws Robert Langdon back into Italy to solve a very conveniently-put-together mystery concerning the Illuminati to save the Vatican.The story runs like a locomotive, with great effects and just fine direction from Ron Howard and Tom Hanks' return in the role of Langdon is, as well, just fine. The film sort of runs on autopilot and it's an entertaining ride.However, the great thing about this film is how it truly does shed a crystal-clear, bright light on how truly ridiculous and corrupt the Catholic church really is. The church apparently didn't have much to say about the film upon its release as they stated it was 'harmless entertainment' while the President of the Catholic League stated 'Enjoy the movie, but know that it is a fable.' Their nonchalant nature spoke volumes.No doubt, much of what the film shows is based on truth, I have no doubt. As all religions have already been disproved a hundred times over by science, the Catholic church and its corrupt politics and horrifying popes are no doubt worried about that one moment when science actually crosses over and disproves the Bible once and for all with no way of covering everything up again and shoving it into the archives.So, the film is fine, but the light cast upon the Church is brilliant, and for that, I thank you, Mr. Howard, even if these sorts of lights apparently just continue to merely blind people instead of showing them the truth.",7,0,2,6 January 2013
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay Reminder: The FIRST PART of the THIRD Book...
","After two utterly fantastic films, The Hunger Games returns with the third installment, which is the first part of the third book of the trilogy.Got it? Good.And the film delivers exactly what I expected. And because of this, it is, indeed, the weakest installment thus far.Why? Well, reread my first sentence. It is the first part of the third book....which means that, from the third book, all the good stuff is going to be in the SECOND part and this whole film is all about ramping up to the (what will most assuredly by) the epic conclusion of this series.That being said, this film still has many strengths, including Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence as she continues to shine as Katniss, this time as the woman who needs to rise and lead District 13 into a full on rebellion against The Capital while still trying to overcome the mental stress of all she has been through. And, of course, the very odd inclusion of the always great Julianne Moore as the rebellion leader, President Alma Coin.The groundwork which is set by the film no doubts raises expectations of the final film very high, but I could not also help by feel that there seemed to be things even I missed as I watched this film. As I sat there, taking it all in, I wondered exactly what Effie (Elizabeth Banks) was doing there....it kind of went unexplained. Exactly how much time passed between the last film and this one? And it seemed like a lot of my questions stems from items that were, indeed, somewhat changed from the book. Effie should not be such a prominent character this early on in the final story, but Banks' character proved to simply be too popular to ignore.That would be the only major downfall of this installment, and that is the lack of clarification of key points brought up in the film. But beyond that, everything else was right on par and I am most certainly looking forward to the final installment hitting theatres next November 20th.Grade: B",7,1,10,28 December 2014
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," A Blunder of a Sequel
","Sorry Holmes fans, but this one falls flat on its face. And breaks its nose. And then gets kicked in the gut.It's as if Guy Richie took courses from Michael Bay on how to make a typical American movie: Think about the cool special effects first and try to build a story around them after...though, really, the story is not that important.After an astonishingly good first instalment that featured top-notch acting, storytelling AND great special effects (and despite Rachel McAdams), Holmes returns for another caper with Jude Law's Watson in tow. This time, they are facing Professor Moriarty. What the movie is really about is hard to say, however, as the script was so weak, it kept getting lost in the line of fiery explosions, effects and Downey Jr. in drag.Were the special effects good? Sure...but we saw similar ones in the first one which were not really improved upon, and the fact that there was more story, less effects last time made them all the more impressive. This time around, you are beaten over the head with them and left wondering what they were trying to get across in the first place.Yes, Holmes has a misfire. With Downey's acting wasted on a second-rate script (if you could call it that), the two-year wait for this dismal sequel was a waste. We can only hope they learn from this, though a third instalment couldn't get much worse. Unless it's actually directed by Michael Bay.",2,32,66,27 December 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," It doesn't get better than this.
","I kinda wish someone had warned me about this film, and at the same time, kinda happy I had no idea what was coming. If I had known exactly what this film was about, I may have been slightly reticent to go see it by myself, but I think I would have been equally as embarrassed to have seen it with other people.Why? Because five minutes in, the film managed to grab hold of me on an emotional level like no film has done in decades, forcing me to fight against tears tooth and nail right through until the credits began to roll. And I am not exaggerating. Not even remotely. And I just barely won the fight.With that in mind, I'll keep the details to a minimum, but I warn you, if my words move you to see this film, you may want to go in prepared (or wait for the DVD), although little could have prepared me for such a beautifully honest and gut-wrenching film.Charlie is a loner. He had a best friend, but that friend is gone. He's about to start high school, but just doesn't quite fit in anywhere. A brilliant student with a complete lack of social skills. That is, until he finds every ounce of courage he has to speak with Patrick. And suddenly, he is introduced to a world of people kind of like him. People who don't need to question him to understand him.He found a band of wallflowers.I was well-aware that this little indie-ish film had been extremely well-received by critics, and has managed a moderate box office. However, what piqued my interest is the fact that, as Oscar murmurs pick up strength and sail from whispers to rumbles, critics after critic have randomly called this movie out of left field as a film that should up 'for your consideration.' All I could think was, 'Wow, really? A teen movie is THAT good?' Well, without hesitation, I can say with all honesty that it is really that good. I will go as far to say that it may just be the best film I have seen all year.Much of the Oscar whispers focus on two things: the flawless script by Stephen Chbosky (who adapted the film from his own epistolary 1999 novel of the same name and also directed) and Ezra Miller. After a phenomenal turn as a tormented teen in last year's exquisitely disturbing 'We Need to Talk about Kevin,' Miller's Patrick is indeed an incredibly memorable young man, playing a teen held back at school with skin that has become so thick, he is not a victim of the torment of his peers, but has instead learned to embrace it. Emma Watson, in her first post-'Harry Potter' starring role, is stunning as Sam, in terms of both her physicality and her acting, the beautiful young woman who is trying to put her past behind her and find her place in the world. But, in my humble opinion, the bulk of emotional gravitas radiates from the film's rising star, Logan Lerman. As the conflicted, unstable and completely lost Charlie, Lerman's performance is nothing short of revelatory. With every look, awkward touch and utterance from his mouth, he is like Michael Cena stripped of sarcasm and overloaded with brilliance and emotion.And while their screen time ranges from actively supporting to mere minutes, even the secondary roles, played by Paul Rudd as 'that teacher' that some of us will remember and cherish forever , Kate Walsh ('Private Practice') and Dylan McDermott ('American Horror Story') as Charlie's parents, and Mae Whitman ('Parenthood') as one of the wallflowers, add to the incredible emotional complexity, lending this film such an unobtrusive air of honesty and genuine feeling that to not be deeply moved by the story as it unfolds before you is practically inconceivable.If you have always been the pretty one with the perfect grades or the perfect job, the popularity, and attention focused on you, maybe you won't quite get it. But for the majority of us who have ever spent time wondering where the hell we fit in in this world, whether it be back in high school...or right now...keep the Kleenex close. If this film does not move you to your very foundation, make you think of where you have been, maybe where you are, or worry about what your kids might be silently going through, I don't know what else would.'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is such an acutely executed film, it overflows with authenticity thanks to extraordinary performances by an almost implausibly perfect cast of young talent. If the AMPAS voters fail to take notice, it will be a shame, not just because nothing else hit the big screen this year like it and it deserves the extra recognition, but because an entire generation or two (or three) should take notice.Yes, it is THAT good. In a world where we need to assure our younger generation that 'it gets better,' parents, teachers, wallflowers? Please, take notice. And grab the Kleenex. You've been warned.",10,16,24,7 December 2012
Skyfall," No, the is NOT the best Bond film ever....However...
","No, this is NOT the 'best Bond movie ever.' However, yes...it is a great action film.For his third installment, Daniel Craig returns to perfect form (in more ways than one) in the twenty-third film that brings certain elements back to Bond basics. Kick-starting with the as-expected excellent opening action sequence which sets up the tone of the rest of the film, don't go expecting a 'fun' Bond, as this installment, although littered with humour and self-referential moments, is relatively dark and serious...and not necessarily as heroically-motivated as it is a story motivated by more of a personal crusade.Without giving anything away, this time around, Bond is not saving the world, necessarily, he's not really even saving a city. After MI6 is targeted by a terrorist, a resurrected Bond returns to go after the man responsible as it seems that, ultimately, what seems to be targeted is M herself. And thus, not the lightest of action films. But a seriously great ride, just the same.That being said, Craig is still second-to-none as a Bond with wit, looks, stealth and vengeance in his eyes. The most human of all Bonds, even when he is not up to par on certain levels, there is no question the man is still made of a different cloth than you or me, and thus, even when pulling a stunt wounded, you do not question his ultimate ability to do so.As the film's villain, Oscar-winning Javier Bardem, and a horrible blond wig, step up to the challenge. As the sexually ambiguous Silva, Bardem shows that he is certainly a go-to guy for such a position while not utilizing his brilliance as an actor to necessarily rise to occasion so much that Silva will ever be remembered as one of the greatest, most threatening or most dangerous villains Bond has encountered...contrary to what other people are mistakenly saying. Bardem is both exciting in some regards and slightly disappointing in others, but overall, remains entertaining to watch.Dame Judi Dench is superb, as always, as M...in trouble. But the introduction of Ralph Fiennes as a potential new adversary for those within the shaky walls of MI6 offers a hint of new blood being injected into the series along with the the One-Direction reject that plays Q, Ben Wishaw. Bond girls Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe are both excellent.So, while Daniel Craig proves for the third time that he is the greatest actor to ever step foot in the role of bond, no....'Skyfall' is not the best Bond film ever and Adele's title track is definitely one of the worst. However, it does include one of the best, most surprising lines in the history of the series in 'What makes you think it's my first time?' When you learn the context, you'll love it, too.",8,3,11,11 November 2012
Marie Antoinette," Yet another example as to why Sofia should never direct again.
","In preparation for the Academy Awards, I made a list of all the nominated films I had not yet seen in order of importance and availability. As Marie-Antoinette was only nominated in one category, for Best Costume Design, it was low on the list, but, unfortunately, I had time to get it.122 minutes of my life I will never get back again.This has got to be one of the most useless films I have seen in a very long time. I mean, it has no historical value, no educative value, the acting is terrible, the dialogue was absolutely horrifying How Coppola even got this film made is beyond me, as the film company and producers should be completely embarrassed this actually made it onto celluloid.Kirsten Dunst, generally a pretty good actress, plays the title character with such blandness and without showing even a glimpse of her acting ability. Paris Hilton could have played the part. At least it might have been funny. I mean, the woman was Austrian and played by Dunst with no accent? Coppola did this on purpose, but that trick worked brilliantly in a grandiose film like Amadeus. Here, it just came across as ridiculous. Jason Schwartzman rendered the character of Louis XIV insignificant. There is not a trace of why this film was made to be found. What was the purpose of showing scene after scene of Marie dressing and undressing and not getting her husband to have sex with her for ages? The film doesn't even get to the infamous beheading of the French queen. In short, it taught me nothing beyond what a bad filmmaker Coppola is.Granted, the music in the film is exceptional and the costumes were absolutely extraordinary.it did go on to win the Oscar it was nominated for. However, the fact this film is now related to the Academy Awards in any respect is a complete joke. Coppola should go back to just being her father's daughter and avoid ever making anyone go through such an excruciating experience as watching this completely useless mess was.",1,13,22,4 March 2007
If I Stay," Beautiful
","Anyone interested in this film already knows the premise by now if they have read this far, so I won't rehash it.All I will say is that this film could have easily been contrived and cheesy and hokey and clichéd but rather, the end is result is truly one of the finest, most real representations of youth and love I have seen in a long time. And the fact that it seemed so genuine is exactly why I have not cried in a film so much since....'The Perks of Being a Wallflower.' Chloe Grace Moretz has already proved she is a force to be reckoned with, but by an accomplishment like playing the key character in a film that was made to be a tearjerker without coming across as completely laughable shows what a strong actress this young woman truly is.Excellent, relatable script, wonderful direction and perfectly edited, the fact the a bunch of tween girls went 'Huh? What? That's the end?' when the credits began to roll proved that R.J. Cutler knew exactly when to end this film at the precise moment. There was no need to overstay the welcome.Make sure you have some Kleenex.",9,133,187,22 August 2014
The Hunger Games," An Absolute Triumph.
","As a pop culture junkie, I have been waiting for this film for a very long time. Just like that other big YA series about dead people and really hairy men, I had never even heard of 'The Hunger Games' until they started discussing the movie. But the hype certainly peaked my curiosity, strengthened by the casting of Oscar-nominated Jennifer Lawrence in the title role. Yep, March 23rd was reserved a long time ago for 'Hunger Games.' Due to the absolutely incredible response and pre-sales of tickets, seeing it on opening weekend didn't happen, but the few days of delay hardly hurt. With phenomenal reviews and most considering this one of the best book-to-screen adaptations in recent history, the monumental, record-breaking $155 million box office take over the weekend just flamed the roaring fire of anticipation.And yes, unlike most other films with this much hype, 'The Hunger Games' is one of those rare films that should have been buried under it but instead, not simply rises above, but easily surpasses all possible expectation.We all know the general story of it being about a bunch of kids thrown into a televised reality show which pits them against each other to the death as a way of repenting for the war-like sins of their forefathers. However, it is not an exploitative film about kids killing each other, but rather an absolutely thrilling film about class, survival and the basic good and evil of people.Jennifer Lawrence proves that her Oscar-nominated performance in 2010's 'Winter's Bone' was not a fluke. Playing Katniss with an absolutely even perfection of awkwardness, shyness, remorse and bitterness, she turned a potentially very unlikeable character into someone we can all relate to, whether you're the thirteen year old girl who devoured the books...or a thirty-seven year old man who had never even heard of them. She is, in a word, captivating.But not only does Lawrence shine. In a role that could have just been a waste of a cute guy, the extremely cute Josh Hutcherson ('The Kids are All Right') as Peeta proves he has far more to offer than just an extremely handsome face but some real acting chops to boot. In a much more minor role, but still incredibly memorable, Liam Hemsworth is just a feast for the eyes as Gale Hawthorn as is the incredibly delicious Alexander Ludwig as the evil Cato.Lest we forget the adults in the film, all of which are played by outstanding actors in their own right, and every single one of them at the top of their game. Stanley Tucci reigns as the host of The Hunger Games, Elizabeth Banks shines as Effie Trinket, Donald Sutherland is statuesque as the president, and in a completely surprising left-of-centre role, Woody Harrelson continues to dominate the screen as mentor Haymich Abernathy. Not to mention, I don't think Lenny Kravitz has ever looked so handsome as he is playing Cinna.All this to say 'The Hunger Games' is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it enraptured me completely. Are there aspects I wish I understood a little bit better from reading the book? Sure...but that's why one has literate friends. There are mild imperfections, but all are easily forgiven by otherwise strong storytelling, excellent direction, perfect performances, incredible costume design and art direction and astounding cinematography and effects.'The Hunger Games' was like watching the merging of 'Survivor,' 'Lost,' 'American Idol,' 'Big Brother,' 'The Truman Show' and the Academy Awards into one spectacular event. The mere grandeur of the film leaves me confused as to how anyone could walk away even remotely unimpressed when the execution is perfection.Certainly one of the best films I have seen in a long time, the easily the best ''hype' film since 'Avatar,' 'The Hunger Games' has easily left me starving for more. When 'Catching Fire' comes out next year, you can bet I'll be getting my tickets real early.",9,2,8,27 March 2012
The Impossible," An Emotional Journey Through the Human Spirit
","I offer two pieces of advice if going to see 'The Impossible.' 1) Bring Kleenex 2) Bring extra Kleenex.'The Impossible' is the true story of the Belón family. Mother, father and three children who survived the devastating 2004 Tsunami which ripped apart south-east Asia. There has been some criticism that the film 'Hollywoodized' the story by 'whitewashing' the family, but clearly, they have not seen the film. The beauty of this story, written by María Belón and turned into a screenplay by Sergio G. Sánchez, may never have been able to be produced had they not been able to bring in big-name stars and get the funding for spectacular special effects, so one must forget the politics and just be truly happy this story made it to the big screen at all in a form which could touch a wide audience.Naomi Watts plays Maria Bennet who, along with her son Lucas, are separated from her husband, Henry (Ewan McGregor) and her other two sons, Thomas and Simon, after the tsunami hits the resort where they were vacationing. This is the true story of how they miraculously survived and found each other.And a reminder of the hundreds of thousands that were not as fortunate.Watts has been nominated for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for her riveting performance as Maria, and with reason. The amount of emotion and pain this woman pours into the role makes it easily one of the most heartbreaking of the year. Sadly, she is not a front-runner, but this performance is far more deserving than the woman who is.And I am not one who is generally terribly impressed by younger performers, but if there was any young actor this year who actually deserves an Oscar nomination, it is Tom Holland in the role of Lucas. The depth and feeling that this kid brings to his role is astonishing for someone of his age. Unlike the other young kid that was nominated this year, Holland actually showed some actual skill in his craft and not just merely being, well, a kid.This is not to overlook excellent performances as well by an incredible strong McGregor and, yes, the two younger actors that pulled in much of the emotional weight, Samuel Joslin and Oaklee Pendergast.'The Impossible' is an extraordinary journey of the human spirit. Not always easy to watch, but the devastation and pain is worth experiencing. Through the love of this family and the efforts of the people of Thailand, you are brought into an emotional wave almost as strong as the horrific tsunami itself while it drags you through the heartbreak to the bitter end.Take my advice, bring extra Kleenex.",10,15,24,22 January 2013
Argo," Astonighingly good work from Affleck. Yes...Ben Affleck.
","For anyone who doesn't believe in second comings, one just has to turn to....Ben Affleck? Yes. Ben Affleck.After making a huge name for himself in the late 90s and early 00s as an actor and heartthrob, winning an Oscar (yes, everyone, remember, Affleck already has an Oscar for co-writing 'Good Will Hunting' with Matt Damon) and being half of Bennifer, 'Gigli' happened and Affleck from being the most over-exposed man in the world to all but disappearing for a few years.And then, he rose from the ashes, first proving himself as someone who could actually act in 'Hollywoodland' before making his completely-out-of-left-field mark as a promising director with 'Gone Baby Gone' (which he also wrote). And then, for those who thought it was potentially beginners luck, he went on to write and direct the highly-acclaimed 'The Town,' which many thought would lead him to bask in some more Oscar nominations. Ultimately, the film got nothing but an acting nomination for Jeremy Renner, but the seed was planted.Now, Affleck returns once again to the director's chair and the lead-actor's position with 'Argo,' the completely ridiculous-but-true story of how a fake film thought to be in production by a fake Canadian production team helped extricate six American hostages from Iran during the Iran Hostage Crisis in 1979. Based on the true story of CIA operative Tony Mendez, declassified in 1997 by Bill Clinton, the storyline of this movie would be considered completely idiotic if it weren't based on true events.Affleck, as Mendez, takes on the role, and 70s chic, with an incredibly impressive voracity. As a man doing exactly what he specializes in trying to pull off what most thought was a suicide mission, Affleck shows a great strength in his depiction of vulnerability. But with such an outstanding cast around him, and this film truly is a group effort, including excellent performances from everyone from Victor Garber, Alan Arkin, John Goodman, the delicious Tate Donovan and a possible Oscar-nomination for the impeccable Bryan Cranston (can this man do no wrong?), 'Argo' may very well put Affleck in the spotlight for yet another couple of nominations himself, including Best Director.A film based on true events can be a tough sell for a thriller, when many know the ultimate outcome walking into the cinema, thus making tension difficult to achieve. However, this film is so impeccably edited and paced, despite knowing exactly what happened, the levels of stress were still fully formulated that you find yourself on the edge of your seat, just waiting for the moment you can let it all go, as a tear runs down your face.I salute Mr. Affleck. Not only has the man gone from Oscar winner to action superstar to tabloid fodder to punch line to, now, distinguished director, he has carried himself with grace and charisma and has shown that underneath the silliness of his early days, there was a real cinematic talent there that just needed the right time, the right push and the right story. He found that in 'Gone Baby Gone' And because of that, we got....'Argo.' And yeah, the dude is still smoking hot.",9,0,1,30 October 2012
Midnight in Paris," Another cute, but somewhat over-rated, Allen film
","Woody Allen, like most directors, has had some moments on pure perfection ('Match Point') and pure garbage ('Shadows and Fog'), but as much as I have the utmost respect for the man, I wouldn't say I am a fan, I just have merely loved a couple of his movies, hated a few others, and there are many I am sure I haven't seen or are somewhat indifferent about.However, 'Midnight in Paris,' for sure, despite being one of his most commercially successful films ever, is not one of his best works. Despite his Golden Globe win for Best Screenplay, this is not the best Screenplay of the year, nor is it one of Allen's best. And despite his Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy or Musical, Owen Wilson's performance is nothing more than acceptable. However, despite the inclusion of Rachel McAdams, I found this to be an alright little film.Wilson plays Gil, a screenplay writer who decides he wants to venture into more serious literature and write a novel. While in Paris with his new fiancÃ©e, Inez, and her parents, Gil begins to question how he really feels about his future wife, played by the always-annoying McAdams, after getting slightly drunk and being abandoned on the streets of Paris by her and her friends only to be randomly picked up by a strange taxi just after midnight, transporting him to Paris in the 20s...a period Gil has always fantasized about.While transported, he meets the likes of F.Scott Fitzgerald, Josephine Baker, Cole Porter, Salvador Dali, Ernest Hemingway, among others and even gets his novel critiqued by Gertrude Stein, all the while falling for a woman he meets named Adriana (played by the lovely Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard)...and thus leading him to wonder how he truly feels about the overbearing, non-too-supportive Inez.'Midnight in Paris' is a cute little film, just like many Allen films, but is hardly a terribly significant cinematic entry and thus, I am not so sure the numerous accolades it has been given, including the Golden Globe, are really deserving. It's a fine film but, for me, ultimately forgettable.",6,2,3,22 January 2012
Milk," Extraordinary
","My knowledge of Harvey Milk's story prior to walking into Gus Van Sant's extraordinary drama of the life and times of the openly gay politician was vague at best. I knew he was the first elected municipal leader to be openly gay in US history and I knew he was assassinated. However, as his story unfolded, I learned just how important this man is to American history and just how much he truly was the Martin Luther King of the Gay Rights Civil movement by how much he pushed it forward by leaps and bounds.Part of me wishes this film had been released prior to the US elections as it could have had a ripple effect and helped prevent the human rights disaster that is California's Proposition 8 from ever passing. However, I believe it could still have a huge hand in changing the ideals and the thoughts of many of the ignorant masses if they actually just gave two hours of their life to watch what this man did for the people, the city of San Francisco, the state of California, if not the nation.Sean Penn in the lead role is undeniably one of the strongest performances, if not the strongest performance, of the year, if not his career. The gage of true talent is when an actor who has so much history and is so well known actually makes you forget you are watching them. Penn became Milk in all his homosexual glory. As his lover of many years, James Franco, best known as a pseudo teen heartthrob, proves he may have what it takes for longevity giving a strong supporting performance that also has been causing whispers of Oscar nomination. Admittedly, the first time you see these two manly-men-like actors kiss, it may cause you to gigglebut it's because they jump into it before you've had a chance to even settle into your seat. But soon, you forget who you're watching and the two become nothing but their characters and you feel a natural love between the two like any other on-screen couple.Emile Hirsch, highly praised for last year's Into the Wild, is almost unrecognizable as one of Milk's devout supporters, Cleve Jones, and could be invited to Oscar night as well. Even Josh Brolin's turn as obviously-closeted Dan White, one of San Francisco's other elected reps who went on to assassinate Milk and mayor George Moscone, offered up an incredibly strong, subtle performance.No doubt, this film could potentially get a lot of attention from the Academy if the film is not deemed 'to gay' by its members. Brokeback Mountain may have gotten a lot of attention, but its heterosexual elements may have helped that. There is nothing heterosexual about Milk, the man and the film. This may be the gayest major-studio film ever made which may hurt or harm its chances come Oscar night.We can only hope this film gets the credit it deserves across the board, especially for Sean Penn. To paraphrase Alan Ball, Oscar-winning writer of American Beauty and creator and Executive Producer of HBO's 'Six Feet Under,' a straight actor taking on a gay role is no longer an act of bravery, however a straight actor refusing to play gay is an act of cowardice. Sean Penn may not have been brave by taking on the role of Harvey Milk, but his portrayal of this man made Milk's monumental bravery crystal clear. Harvey Milk is a hero.",10,6,13,5 December 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tinker Tailor Soldier Snore
","More like 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Snore.' Tomas Alfredson's big screen interpretation of John le Carre's spy novel may have won over many critics, and now the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, but it certainly didn't impress me.I would try to tell you what the film is about, but seriously, I had little idea what I saw until I got home and re-read the plot on Wikipedia...and even then, it wasn't terribly clear. But it is about an ex-Secret Service guy, played by Gary Oldman, who is looking for a mole in the higher ranks of the British Secret Service.Loads of things happen in this film, and I guess it was just done in a way that went so completely over my head, I spent the entire film just barely understanding what I was watching. It was like they condensed an entire season of a television series into a two hour movie, making it virtually impossible to follow. To understand it properly, I would have to watch it again.And believe me, that is not going to happen.The way Anderson directed it is well done in some ways, but with frame after frame of a backdrop so dreary, it makes London look suicide-inducing, the film plugs along without having any redeemable features that will truly grab your interest and keep you entertained. When someone gets shot in the head, you think finally! Some action! And then it sinks back into the greys and far too many words and names to keep track of.I think the only reason why the script got an Oscar nomination was that it may have been the thickest of them all, because it certainly was not written well enough for the average human to keep up with the story and keep one terribly interested. A nomination for the score? Sorry, nothing impressive there either. It was as long and drawn out as the film was.And then there is the Best Actor nomination for Gary Oldman. I would understand it if he were old enough to maybe not get another one, but out of all the performances I have seen this year, this one certainly did not stand out as deserving such a recognition. Yep, there could have easily been a spot there for a more deserving Gosling.Yep, after sitting through this overly complicated bore of a film, not only did my head hurt, but so did my wallet.",3,7,13,31 January 2012
Crash," Unbelievable
","There is no point to say too much about this film except that everyone should see it's brilliance for themselves. Every frame, every shot, every story, every character left me absolutely speechless by the end. One of those few movies that would reach every single person indiscriminately, because it's about a subject that faces us all, whether we admit it or not.Breathtaking and raw, real and pungent.And what extraordinary performances by Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock and Don Cheadle.If Oscar overlooks this, I will again be speechless.",10,7,17,10 September 2005
Horrible Bosses," Ain;t NOTHING horrible here....
","Yep...the best comedy of the year so far has been released.Sorry, 'Bridesmaid,' you are now in second place.When Nick, Kurt and Dale get pushed just a little too far by their employers, they realize that the only way they might be able to break free from employment hell is....to kill their bosses.And a plan gets set into motion... Well, kinda....and thus, hilarity ensues.In what may be some of the best comedic turns in ages, Jason Bateman, Jason Sudeikis (SNL) and Charlie Day ('It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia') don't merely step up to comedic plate...all three hit home runs as the plotting disgruntled employees. However, almost more impressive is the unexpectedly brilliant performances by the horrible bosses themselves. Kevin Spacey, always brilliant, shines with excellent comedic flair as Nick's masochistic president. Colin Farrell, almost unrecognizable here, shines as Kurt's coke-head, womanizing sleazeball of a boss. But Jennifer Aniston, after a flood of tepid comedies, takes the cake as she returns to the silver screen with a vengeance as Dale's blatantly sexually harassing, dirty-mouthed vixen of a dentist.Wrapping it all up is Jamie Foxx, triumphant as a 'murder consultant' with one of the most unsubtle character names to hit cinemas in a long time.An absolute blast from the get-go, 'Horrible Bosses' is definitely in line with the aforementioned 'Bridesmaids' and the 'Hangover' series in terms of raunch and crass humour, but the execution and writing here is just astounding.Few movies scream 'buy me' from the midway point, but seriously, if you need to bust a gut, you'll be in for ninety-seven minutes of pure comedic bliss.",Null,0,0,12 July 2011
Life of Pi," Visually captivating but somewhat underwhelming.
","First and foremost, I'd like to set the record straight. If you're one of those people who think 'Life of Pi' is pretty much just a movie about a dude in a boat with a tiger, well, I have news for you......you're right.Ang Lee's latest feature, an adaptation of the book by Yann Martel which, after numerous attempts by other directors including M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Curon and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, was deemed 'unfilmable,' is indeed the story of a shipwrecked boy who survives for weeks on a lifeboat he shares with a Bengali tiger. As told to a reporter (Rafe Spall) by an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) from his Montreal home (Canada REPRESENT!), the story starts off with Pi's childhood and religious awakening before spending much time at sea...on a boat...with a big cat.Religion is the overpowering theme of the film, there is no doubt, but not in a preachy sort of way. Rather than being some sort of moralistic tale, the point I believe the narrative is trying to make is that personal spirituality is important, no matter what you may believe, and we should all just respect each other's points of view. And although I am a non-believer, that is something I cannot fault. If only, right? When a young Pi finds an interest in Christianity after having been raised Hindu and discovering the Muslim religion, his father brilliantly exclaims 'I'd rather you believe in something I do not agree with than accept all religions blindly.' Excuse me if I am paraphrasing slightly there, but the line was very powerful and one I can respect a great deal.However, despite the lovely religious equilibrium and the cute ferocious animal, 'Life of Pi' never quite managed to enrapture me. The filming style, with its cuts and edits, came across almost amateurish and TV_movie-like while I found the script slightly underwhelming and the performances merely acceptable. Nothing more.But who am I kidding...I did not see the movie for the story. What intrigued me about the film was the talk of the visual effects. THAT is what I went for. Having been heralded as the most visually captivating film since 'Avatar,' I was full of anticipation for this film for that reason and that reason only.And it is indeed a beautiful movie to watch on the largest screen possible. Definitely in 3D. The scenes are so incredibly drawn and meticulously brought to 3D life, you will almost forget what is going on in the film at times because you're busy staring too long at the CGI tiger going 'wow, how did they do that?' Don't worry, it's not like you'll miss an important plot point. And you will find yourself asking that exact question many times during this film. However, it is no 'Avatar,' which remains the most visually magnificent film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing (although I am sure many of you will see elements which have been borrowed from it at certain moments). To be honest, I didn't even find it as visually captivating as 'Cloud Atlas,' as the beauty of the images hinder rather than help the audience personally connect with a story which seems a tad bit far-fetched as it is.No doubt Lee, a two-time Oscar nominee for 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'Brokeback Mountain,' for which he won, will undoubtedly get an invitation back to the ceremonies this year for his visual epic, but it's best chances at gold will be strictly technical, as the film itself leaves one a little underwhelmed. That time you spent the night with someone astonishingly beautiful but not terribly interesting? Yeah, kinda like that.",8,3,9,23 November 2012
Interstellar," The long-await, yet underwhelming, return of Nolan.
","After a year of waiting and hype, 'Interstellar' finally hit theatres with....well, not quite a roar. Written as a love letter to his daughter, Nolan's latest sci-fi epic isn't quite as depressing as his usual films, but it's not as monumentally mesmerizing as we have come to expect from the man who brought us 'Dark Knight' and 'Inception.'.The story is a little cheesy, with mushy questions about love being able to cross time and such, and there are moments that the special effects reminded me of 'Clash of the Titans.' No, not the remake...the 1981 original. I found that quite shocking and sorta dismaying...and confusing. As confusing as it was at times trying to wrap my brain around the concepts of relative time and black holes and dimensions.However, the film is ultimately still entertaining, made me verklempt at moments and has a really nice message about the future of our planet being in our own hands and no one else, not even whatever god you might believe in, is going to save us if we don't save ourselves.",8,0,3,8 November 2014
Kung Fu Panda 2," The Hangover 2 of 2012 Animation
","I wasn't all that impressed with the first one, so when a sequel came out, I sort of scratched my head and wondered why they would have bothered...and sure enough, the sequel goes and gets nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.Go figure.Once again, Po is back to overcome a huge hurtle despite his attitude and his tummy. This time, he has to save all of China! Yeah, it's pretty much the exact same sort of plot as the first one.And people made fun of The Hangover 2.Go figure.Once again, there is nothing particularly spectacular about the animation, the script nor the voice acting. Really, there is nothing really noteworthy here at all. So why it has been nominated for an Oscar over even Tintin is beyond me.But yeah, if your kids liked the first one, they will like this one. If YOU liked the first one and you're not a child, well, I will reserve those comments.",3,2,8,20 February 2012
Hugo," Visually Stunning but Ultimately a Bore.
","Going into 'Hugo,' the great Martin Scorcese 3D opus, I had not read what it was actually about. I just heard that it was a spectacular film with some incredible use of 3D, I knew it was nominated for three Golden Globes and, hell, it is directed by Scorcese.To be honest, as much as I knew it was going to be a child-friendly adventure, I thought it was some sort of sci-fi film that had a robot. Um. No.What it is is a visually stunning 3D ode to the art form Scorcese loves the most: film.The title character is not the robot...it is rather a twelve-year old named Hugo Cabret, played by an excellent Asa Butterfield ('Boy in the Striped Pyjamas') who, after the loss of his mother and then the subsequent loss of his watchmaker father (Jude Law is beginning to pop up everywhere again....), Hugo ends up alone, living in the train station, setting the clocks as per his uncle's instruction....and uncle that disappears as well, leaving a young Hugo to his own devices.At the time of his father's death, he and Hugo were working on reanimating an automaton and thus, Hugo not only steals food, but parts as well in an attempt to finish the work he had started with dad...and in the process, opens up a 'mystery' involving an old toy shop owner (Ben Kingsley) and his daughter (the incredibly talented Chloe Grace Morentz proving what an incredible actress she is by mastering a British accent at such a young age).And the 'mystery' at hand is hardly one of the Bobsey Twins nature but rather leads to an admittedly educational and interesting, but not so entertaining, tie-in with real-life film pioneer Georges Melies.'Hugo,' an obvious labour of love for Scorcese, has all the right elements, from excellent performances (yes, even from a handsome Sacha Baron Cohen) to a well-written script to an exceptionally visually stunning 3D experience. The film could very well get Scorcese a couple more Oscar nominations under his belt.But as I was expecting a film about robots and not a history lesson on film, despite the undeniable quality of the film making, bottom line? I found it a bore.",6,9,18,27 December 2011
Warrior," Definitely not on par with 'The Fighter'
","'Warrior' is an alright film, let's get this straight right from the get-go, but it is no 'The Fighter.' Last year's multi-nominated film about boxing was good enough to make even those who hated the sport get sucked into the film.'Warrior' is not even close to being able to claim the same thing.Set in the barbaric world of mixed martial arts, 'Warrior' is yet another film about estranged brothers fighting, literally and figuratively, while dealing with having grown up with an alcoholic father. I will admit, there were moments in this film that did almost bring me to tears and had me rooting for the underdog, but for the most part, at two hours and twenty minutes, I was looking at the clock. The story is simple enough to have not needed nearly as long a running time, and thus this film's editor failed big time. The performances are strong enough, and I will admit, I think I even agree with Nick Nolte's Oscar nomination for his role of the alcoholic father, especially in light of Nolte's own personal trials and tribulations, but where this film fails miserably is making a cohesive story that grabs its viewers and sucks them in, truly feeling empathy for their situation and truly supporting their idiotic decision to get involved with a sport that is so horrifying while being inexplicably popular.Tom Hardy, as the idiotic brother Tommy, a hard-drinking guy whom never once makes you feel sorry for him, gives another strong performance on the heels of 'Inception' and 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,' but never taps into the side of his character that would make the viewer feel for him. Joel Edgerton's Brendan is far more convincing as a man who is financially desperate and thus, taking clocks to the head seems to be his only alternative.But again, despite somewhat strong performances, the lack of character development over the incredibly-too-long runtime of two hours and twenty minutes led this film to be somewhat of a chore.",6,4,9,5 February 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Every once in a blue moon, an American version does far surpass the original.
","As soon as the Stieg Larsson movement made its way to North America, me being a pop culture junkie, I was intrigued. But I hate to read. Lucky for me, of course, the three books in the trilogy had already been made into feature films in Sweden, and thus, I saw them all. And to be quite frank, I didn't really understand what all the fuss was about, as made evident by my reviews of the first three films. The story seemed choppy, convoluted and the films were far too long and seemed to drag forever.I understand now that I think a fair amount was simply lost in translationor missed due to reading sub-titled.'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' has now been remade by an American filmmaker. Although usually the kiss of death right there, well, um.Not this time.As soon as I heard there was to be a remake, I sorta cringed at the thought, but once I saw the Swedish version, I couldn't help but think it could be improved upon considerably. And the story would be much easier to follow in, you know, English. When I found out the man behind the film was going to be David Fincher , however, I couldn't imagine a remake not being anything less than exquisite. With works of brilliance like 'Seven,' 'Zodiac,' and his Oscar-nominated 'The Social Network' under his belt, this film couldn't have possibly been anything less than electrifying.And I was right. Right from his signature, breathtaking opening credits.There were a lot of things about the story I had a hard time keeping track of the first time around, but I remember the film. And what Fincher managed to do was nothing short of beautiful. Staying very true to the original film, but flushing out what I can only imagine to be some of the more subtle details of the book, he has made a much more uniform film.The incredibly talented (and stunning) Daniel Craig takes over the role of Mickael Blomkvist, a discredited journalist who is hired by a wealthy patriarch to try to solve the murder of his niece forty years prior. Aided by a brilliant but troubled researcher, Lisbeth Salander, they uncover corruption that goes far beyond what they expected to find.Craig's performance is nothing short of perfect, but Rooney Mara's transformation into Lisbeth is nothing short of extraordinary. Last seen in a small role in 'The Social Network,' the actress is almost unrecognizable as she executes the troubled character with such precision, watching her on screen is like a moving work of art, both painful and graceful. Having just captured a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, I would be hard pressed to imagine that her nomination won't translate into one for an Academy Award as well. A nomination that I think she could have a serious shot of winning, despite the obvious upcoming inclusion of some woman with the last name of Streep.And although the rest of the supporting cast is made up of excellent performances by the likes of Oscar-nominated Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgard, Robin Wright and a surprisingly strong showing for an unexpected Joely Richardson ('Nip/Tuck'), the real artist here is, once again, Fincher himself. Going against everything most American directors attempt, Fincher did not try to Americanize the film in any way. There was worry that he might water it down or make it more Hollywood-friendly but the end result is, in fact, a film that is even more violent, more distressing, and even more sexually charged than the Swedish attempt. No corners were cut, no locations were changed, no smoothing anything over to avoid an R rating. With just a slight alteration for a more cohesive ending (no idea if this ending is not in the book, or the original films ending is), Fincher managed to make the film I completely expected him to make. And then some.Yes, the film does indeed run a little long, as did the original, but with so much intrigue and twists and turns, it doesn't run so long to make you check the time. It simply manages to tell an excellent story of familial corruption, while conveying the true, intense, incredible hardships of a heartbreakingly beautiful and intelligent but violent woman who has covered up her pain in makeup and hairspray. And tattoos.",9,5,12,21 December 2011
Dreamgirls," Dreamgirls: An Unbelievable Cinematic Experience
","There is not much else to be said about the film event that is 'Dreamgirls.' Like many others, I had a love/hate feeling going into this film when I saw it back in December. There is no doubt that Jamie Foxx has amazing talent for this sort of thing, and his Oscar for Ray proves that...but the guy annoys me and I feel he is a little overrated, really (just listen to his horrid debut album). There is no doubt that Beyonce has incredible singing ability, but I find most of her recorded material boring and tedious (granted, there are a few acceptions), and thus, she annoys me, too. And Eddie Murphy taking on a role like this? I didn't think he could offer anything to the film. The one shining star was Jennifer Hudson who, like anyone else with half a brain and ability to hear, was horrifically voted off American Idol way too early when her voice proved to be one of the best that show ever saw.Well, look who's laughing now.Not only did Hudson learn to play the role by starting rehearsals weeks before the rest of the cast because she just couldn't get the attitude right at first, she sang her way all the way to a Best Actress Academy Award on her first time out, not to mention the Golden Globe and the SAG awards to boot! Beyonce hit the mark as well, also delivering a seriously beautiful new inclusion with the song 'Listen', Foxx did an impeccable job and I truly believe, as much as I respect Arkin, (and I never thought I would say this), Murphy was robbed of an Oscar of his own.An incredible film that deserved every nomination it got, and should have also nabbed a nomination for Best Picture (although it should not have won), this film is definitely one of the most entertaining films of 2006 and one of the best stage to screen translations ever put out there. Whether you like musicals or not, if you enjoy great vocal and acting talents, this is one of the must-see films produced last year.Buying the soundtrack, be sure to get the full 2 CDs.",9,0,0,5 March 2007
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Thanks to HFR3D, a failure of EPIC proportions.
","'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is a failure of epic proportions. If you see it in HFR 3D, that is. And after having spent almost $20 to see it and hate it, I am certainly not going to pay to sit through all two hours and fifty minutes in a different format as the film itself didn't impress me enough to even consider doing that right now. So, I guess it will have to wait.So, with that, after months of anticipation, the film was ruined.Watching this film in HFR was like watching a high-budget PBS television version of the movie, rendering everything to look second rate and really quite ridiculous, including special effects which look like they were lifted from a video game...or a student film. It was like it was made to look like a movie which would only appeal to five-year olds.Mr. Jackson, what were you thinking? Within minutes of the film starting, I couldn't believe it was filmed in such a horrible format which should be saved for sitcoms. The film was immediately rendered a joke. And I still had one hundred and sixty-five minutes to sit through. When I bought my tickets to the film six weeks ago, there was no mention of different formats besides being in 3D. I would never have chosen to watch this film in HFR if I had known in advance. And quite frankly, I think Jackson or the cineplex should give me my money back.So, it's tough to write a proper review of the film because every detail, every word, every effect came across as simply childlike and horribly mediocre simply due to the format. The film seemed to drag on forever and I just couldn't wait for it to end.So, the only advice I can tell you? See it on 3D IMAX....and let me know how it is. Because all I saw was a second-rate disappointment.",1,14,45,15 December 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Another Horrible Ape Instalment
","Despite being a huge fan of James Franco, when the trailers started for this film, the seventh instalment of the 'Planet of the Apes' franchise, all I could think was 'Really?' I was sure it was a guaranteed flop. Then the film got released and not only was it one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, there were numerous critics who PRAISED this film.And I cannot begin to figure out why.I had absolutely no interest in this film at all, especially with the 2001 remake having been such a joke, but found myself curious enough to watch it on a long flight between California and Hawaii. Seeing it was free, and I had nothing but time to waste, I thought sitting through it would at least give me the right to an opinion rather than blindly passing judgement. But my assumption of the film was right. It is absolute crap.Franco plays a scientist developing a serum to combat Alzheimer's and decides to try testing on chimps. Long story short, the serum is so effective, the chimps figure out how to break out of the lab and take over the Golden Gate Bridge. Yeah, all those action scenes you saw in the trailer? Every single one is from the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film.And although the special effects are impressive enough, that, in no way, makes up for the rest of this ridiculously cheesy and horrible film.Even monkeys would be smart enough to avoid this one. So maybe that does prove that chimps are actually smarter than the movie-going masses. Watching a film about a man trying to cure Alzheimer's actually managed to make me feel like a moron for having thought this film might actually have some merit.",2,2,7,14 January 2012
Django Unchained," Well, at least Tarantino managed to make a Western that DIDN'T put me to sleep...
","Oscar made me do it. Yep. The only reason I sat through two hours and forty-five minutes of a Tarantino Western was because I knew this film was going to get Oscar nominations and thus, I was obliged to see it. But I hate Westerns and I am not a fan of Tarantino, so I knew this could be a tough ride.I was partially right.This long, drawn-out story of slavery revenge most certainly had its moments...the problem is that it takes far too many minutes to get through them all.The story is simple enough. Jamie Foxx, in an excellent performance, plays Django, a slave separated from his wife and sold off to a plantation two years before the civil war. While being transported, the caravan is intercepted by Dr. King Schultz, played to perfection (again) by the incomparable Christophe Waltz, who knows Django knows what the three men he needs to kill look like, and thus 'buys' his freedom. In exchange for helping him track his bounty, Schultz indeed offers Django his freedom. However, when he learns the story of Django being separated from his wife...and sees Django's marksmanship... Shultz offers to help Django find his wife if he helps Shultz kill all the men on his bounty list. With the promise of freedom, money AND his wife, how could Django refuse? In theory, 'Django Unchained' has all the elements of a truly great film...and that says a lot coming from a Western-hating, non-Tarantino fan. The story is great. Foxx is great, but Waltz is utterly fantastic...and will be looking at yet another Oscar nomination. Kerry Washington, as Django's wife Broomhilda, proves that she is not only unequivocally stunning to watch but an absolutely exceptional actress. Hell, even Leonardo Dicaprio, as Broomhilda's owner, turns an excellent performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination if he so gets it. Need I even mention that Samuel L. Jackson is perfection? And then there's Don Johnson! Yes! Don Johnson!!! So, pair all these great performances with a great script, loads of violence, two scenes that even made ME squint and squirm, along with beautiful art direction, costumes, cinematography and the controversial overuse of a certain word which actually manages to desensitize you to its utterance, this must be a pretty awesome film, no? Not entirely.It lacks one key ingredient: evidence of an EDITOR. With a running time of two hours and forty-five minutes, this film managed to run way too long. I mean, way too long. This film could have easily been tightened up to run at a smoother, quicker pace and shave off at least thirty minutes. But certain scenes seemed to needlessly drag on, leaving a film which has so many good elements but leaves you mindful of the time as you begin to shift in your seat, your buns going numb. Although 'Inglorious Basterds,' arguably Tarantino's best film, had a scene or two that ran longer than they needed to, I don't remember shifting in my seat nearly as much. What could have been one of the best films of the year merely took far too long to get to the point. But hey, it didn't bore me, so I give Tarantino credit for making potentially the least tedious Western I have ever endured.",8,0,4,4 January 2013
Drive," An unexpected enjoyable ride.
","Despite good reviews, good box office and starring Ryan Gosling, I had very little interest in seeing 'Drive.' But, with an Oscar nomination for Best Sound Editing, it finally ended up on my list.And it's a pretty good film! I found it interesting that from the opening of the film, with the old-school electro beats and a title font that is reminiscent of old 80s films like 'The Flamingo Kid,' my expectations went up. And they weren't necessarily let down.'Drive' is about a guy, played by the ever-gorgeous Ryan Gosling, known only as, you guessed it, The Driver, who works as a stunt driver on films and as a mechanic...and on the side, he is a for-hire getaway driver for criminals. After meeting his lovely neighbour, Irene (played by Carey Mulligan, Oscar-nominated in 2009 for 'An Education') and falling for her, when her husband is released from prison and needs help on a heist, The Driver steps up to help the woman he has fallen for and her son by helping her husband. And the heist goes terribly wrong and subsequently puts everyone in his life in jeopardy.With an absolutely amazing soundtrack and some graphic uber-violence, along with a couple of very effective car chase scenes, 'Drive' is a pretty good action film that has it's moments and is extremely well-written and well-acted. Gosling is stoic but effective as the mysterious Driver while Mulligan continues to impress. However, many speculated that Albert Brooks , nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as a mob guy, would get an Oscar nomination, but I felt the performance by multiple-Emmy-Award-winning Bryan Cranston was far more memorable. Rounding out the effective cast is Oscar Isaac, Ron Perlman and 'Mad Men''s Christina Hendricks.A very odd story about a real left-of-centre hero, 'Drive' is a surprisingly enjoyable ride.",7,3,6,12 February 2012
The Theory of Everything," Less Science, More Humanity.
","If you cannot imagine how a film about Stephen Hawking could be utterly astounding and heartfelt and touching, don't imagineand see 'Theory of Everything.' In short, the incredibly touching back story of Hawking is presented hereless science, more humanityand it is absolutely beautiful.However, Redmayne completely steals the show as Mr. Hawking in an utterly pitch-perfect, transformative performance that will most likely nab him his first Oscar nominationwith a win looking pretty darn good as well as he goes from upright man to wheelchair-bound.Redmayne is mesmerizing.As is this whole incredibly beautiful film.",9,7,13,23 November 2014
Lincoln," The Oscar race has just begun, but it's already all but over.
","It may be premature to say, but I think the Oscar race is already over.'Lincoln,' Steven Spielberg's latest opus which focuses on the final four months of Abraham Lincoln's life, the focal point being his greatest accomplishment, the abolishment of slavery in the United States in January of 1865 and the end of the Civil War, has every element imaginable to render it possibly unbeatable for a slew of Golden statuettes.First and foremost, there is Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. His transformation into America's 16th President is, for lack of a better word, uncanny. I would not for an instant lay claim to knowing very much about the Lincoln in any way, shape or form, but Lewis embodies every detail that I feel I have ever learned about this iconic political figure. From his speech patterns to his physicality, I could not imagine a better performance than what Lewis displays in every single frame he is in. Already a two-time Oscar winner ('My Left Foot' in 1990, 'There Will be Blood' in 2008), winning Best Actor in 2013 is truly his award to lose.And then there is the rest of the cast, each one possibly looking at some recognition by the Academy.Sally Field, also a two-time Oscar winner for 'Norma Rae' in 1980 and again in 1984 for 'Places in the Heart' could very well be looking at her third nomination and possibly a win as Mary Todd Lincoln. Her performance as the emotionally tortured and completely supportive wife is absolutely magnificent.Then there are the supporting players....the members of the House, those who helped Lincoln gain voted to pass the 13th amendment. Tommy Lee Jones, almost guaranteed his fourth Oscar nomination (he won in 1994 for 'The Fugitive'), brings his A game as Thaddeus Stevens, one of the most outspoken Republicans from the area who fought tooth and nail for equality and was one of the greatest proponents of the 13th Amendment. David Strathairn, also an Oscar nominee ('Good Night and Good Luck') as William Seward, the Secretary of State who initially fought against the amendment while remaining loyal to his Commander in Chief. Golden Globe nominee James Spader as W.N Bilbo who was sent out to recruit Democratic votes by any means possible. Oscar nominee Hal Holbrook ('Into the Wild') as Preston Blair, one of Lincoln's faithful advisors. Oscar nominee Jackie Earle Haley ('Little Children') as Alexander Stevens, the vice president to the Confederacy. Even Golden Globe and Emmy nominee Lee Pace, best known for his role in 'Pushing Daisies' offers an exceptional turn as Fernando Wood, one of the staunchest opponents to the slavery amendment. Even smaller roles by the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lincoln's son and Gloria Reuben as one of Lincoln's attendants are more than worthy of noting and praise. John Hawkes is also featured in this film in an excellent performance, but he will be overlooked here, as he will already be looking at a Best Actor nomination for his role in 'The Sessions.' Then there is the writing. Written by the magnificent Tony Kushner, who is not only yet another Oscar nominee for his script for 'Munich' but who also wrote the near-perfect Emmy-winning 'Angels in America,' Kushner's script plays out in brilliant fashion, not only capturing the language and the feel of the era, but also manages to capture the audience while giving what could have been a long-winded history lesson thanks to a perfect blend of drama and humour.All this under the direction of Spielberg (do I bother mentioning his Oscars, too?)? 'Lincoln' is nothing short of a historical masterpiece.It was fascinating to watch the debate on slavery wage on in the House, hearing people's fear that the abolishment of slavery could lead to blacks and women being able to vote and, oh the horror, possibly enter politics! And to think that all this was done by those crazy, 'radical' Republicans. Who would have thought that a hundred years later, the tables would have completely turned on these parties with the Democrats being the party who fights for equality and the mere thought of denying women and ANY minority the right to vote would be ludicrous.And yet, the needless debate of allowing two men or two women to marry rages on in the United States.Let's hope Mr. Obama may find a way to be a modern-day Lincoln.",10,5,17,20 November 2012
The Artist," Cineatic Perfection...without a doubt...without a word.
","This film has got to be the absolute best silent film I have ever seen. Pay no regard to the fact that it is the ONLY silent film I have ever seen.'The Artist' is truly something to behold. In 2011, one would think it would be implausible for anyone to have the guts to produce, direct or star in a silent black and white film, never mind that film garnering as much attention and buzz as this film has. But, here it is. And it is a must-see film.Being silent, it is almost unnecessary to note that the story is incredibly simple: the fall of silent film great George Valentin at the onset of 'talkies' over a four-year period beginning in 1928. But one is not in the cinema for the plot line. if you see this movie, you are most certainly there to witness the execution of this anomaly. I assure you, you will be bewildered.Written and directed by the virtually unknown French director Michel Hazanavicius with absolute pristine perfection, there is no threat that the silent genre is going to make any sort of a comeback, but this man's eye for detail is beyond explanation, and may just lead him to a coveted Academy Award nomination. One of the most visually captivating films of the year, the subtle nuances and imagery set forth goes far beyond any film in recent memory. These nuances, however, would mean nothing if no for the actors, and Hazanavicius struck gold with the casting. Jean Dujardin is guaranteed an Oscar nomination for his lead role of George Valentin. And I would even go so far as to say that, even at this early stage, my money will be on him to win. Not bad for a man who was also virtually unknown to this continent five minutes ago. With no dialogue, it takes one hell of a talent to get across what Dujardin accomplishes merely by body language and facial expression. He is so good that he needs no dialogue for you to almost understand every word. I have a hard time imagining any other performance this year showing such true acting strength as one who carries an entire film without saying a word.The same thing can be said about his co-star Berenice Bejo. Having flirted with American audiences in 'A Knight's Tale' with Heath Ledger ten years ago, Bejo returns to North American soil like a thunderous cloud playing Peppy Miller, one-time-Valentin-super-fan-cum-Hollywood starlet. The absolutely stunning actress will make you fall in love with her merely by the wink of her eye and the air kiss she will throw. Going up against a performance as extraordinary as Dujardin's is no easy feat, and Bejo not only holds her own with ease, but manages to steal a scene here and there merely with her beauty and charm. There has been no Oscar buzz around this name and I am hereby beginning it.Yes, there are some well-known American actors seemingly chosen out of left-field for this French production who also give excellent performances, including the incredibly visual John Goodman, the always solid James Cromwell and even a surprisingly sweet turn for Penelope Ann Miller along with a cameo by Malcolm McDowell. However, the character that most deserves the biggest mention after Dujardin and Bejo is that which was created by Ludovic Bource. Bource created the score. In a film with no dialogue, the driving force behind what you're watching is the music that you hear, and Bource's inventive soundtrack is both inventive, original and serves as practically a supporting character on its own. I smell another guaranteed Oscar nomination here, too.And when the music isn't playing? There are still moments of absolute brilliance, as Hazanavicius uses both silence as a device and, in one scene of extraordinary editing, the use of nightmarish sounds as Valentin dreams of the end of silence.Brilliant? Have I used the word brilliant yet? Brilliant.While this film may not be everyone's cup of tea in terms of entertainment, anyone who does experience it with have a brush with greatness for just under two hours and will certainly get a leg up on next year's Academy Awards.With films like this, who needs dialogue? Certainly not Michel Hazanavicius.",9,0,3,14 December 2011
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Best of the series? Um, no.
","For most, the Twilight Saga has been something either you loved or had no interest in.... If you got past the first film, you were probably in it for the long haul. I was one of those...but unlike the TwiHards and such, it has not been an enjoyable ride.'Twilight,' the first film, was great. I thought everything about it was incredibly entertaining, albeit far from perfect. However, that is where it peaked for me. With every subsequent film, 'New Moon,' 'Eclipse' and the first part of 'Breaking Dawn,' these films got worse and worse and worse.And worse.But as I started this pop culture phenomenal, goddamit, I was going to finish it. And what made the last installment the worst one of the bunch was that there wasn't even a decent consolation prize of gratuitous Lautner nakedness lasting more than eight seconds to make up for the two hours of soap-opera-like pseudo-silly-eye-rolling-drama that we had to endure.Like, c'mon! And thus, that FINALLY brings us to the final chapter of the series, where everything comes to head and we say goodbye to these characters once and for all. And has anything gotten any better? Uh...no.As Bella comes to terms with her new status as Trampire (and her transition was the easiest I've seen of any vampire story), the feared Volturi are gonna come aknocking as they believe a huge taboo has been committed...that the half-human/half-vamp baby of her and Edward was not born but rather created! Oh no! So, the whole last film and the first hour and a bit of this one has been a set up for the final conflict...a conflict that takes forever to get to, finally has some amazing appeal and violence, and then a plot twist just ruins it all in a millisecond.And there you are. Disappointed again. But I will give it credit for having a touching final scene and an impressive final credit role.So, many may claim this is the best of the series, but they would be dead wrong, so to speak. It is definitely the best out of the last four, no doubt, but after the first film, nothing has been able to rise above crap. The acting in this one is just as cardboard as ever, Stewart having not improved her ability to be one of the most popular horrible actresses in Hollywood. When Taylor Lautner is the best actor in your film, you know you may not be in the greatest production.But on that note, there is an excellent scene where Lautner strips down. And for that, this film does go from 3 to 4 out of 10...and those of us who were most motivated to see these the last four films by Lautner's pecs, we thank you.",4,29,89,17 November 2012
Rio," Guess what happens next! Oh wait, you know, don't you.
","I don't think anyone would deny that although there was a time when almost every animated film that came out was at least good and creative and had some great songs, that time is gone. And 'Rio' doesn't help the cause very much.With a very weak, almost-not-there-yet-still-incredibly-predictable-story, 'Rio' focuses on Blu, a Macaw that was stolen from Brazil when he was young for reselling but inadvertently falls off a truck and into the life of Linda, who raises him domestically in Minnesota. When a random ornithologist walks into Linda's book shop and sees a now all-grown-up Blu, he invites them down to Rio de Janeiro so Blu can mate with his female counterpart, Jewel, as they are the last two of their kind. Because we all know if you get asked to go to Rio by a total stranger, even if you own a business, you just pack up and leave, and so they are off to Brazil. However, before Blu and Jewel can do the deed, they both get stolen for sale on the black market again...and a very light, forgettable 'adventure' ensues.There is no doubt that this film is gorgeous to watch. A virtual colour orgasm, 'Rio' will make you want to go to Rio! And the opening song, 'Real in Rio,' one of the only two Oscar-nominated songs this year, is a fantastic tune. But the film itself won't hold much interest for anyone over the age of ten. Once you get over the well-done animation and the colours, there really is not much else there. And generally, I find the use of a well-known actor's voice fun in an animated film, but here, Jessie Eisenberg doing the voice of Blu just ends up nothing more than distracting most of the time.So. Um. Yeah. There's a reason this film didn't get nominated for Best Animated Feature. It's as clear as the skies in Brazil on a sunny day.",5,0,0,18 February 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Potentially the Most Overrated Film of the Year
","There is much to be said about 'Zero Dark Thirty,' Kathryn Bigelow's cinematic retelling of the hunt and killing of Osama bin Laden, but the most apt term that comes to mind is 'overrated.' Plot-wise, we all know how it goes and how it ends. War, hunting, research, torture, invasion, death. It covers a very long span in two hours and forty-five minutes and gives a somewhat choppy rendition of the 'actual' events that lead to the discovery of where the world's most infamous terrorist was hiding.I put the term 'actual' in quotes because there is much debate as to how much of the film is true. Having seen it with a friend who knows more than the average person when it comes to American military manoeuvres, in my humble opinion, the all so-called 'controversy' of the details of the film being somewhat untrue were created to mislead the public into thinking the truth was actually potentially fictitious.Smart move, US military. Smart move.That being said, the film is quite entertaining and really enlightening on many aspects of a hunt for a man that took almost a decade to find. Knowing the film was already in production prior to the actual killing of bin Laden, forcing Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal to backtrack and rewrite the entire ending to the film, lends much gravitas to the information being shared. Knowing some military officials' careers were put in jeopardy for revealing too much intel to Boal lends even more weight. That and the fact that I, myself, had my own intel that some details shared were thought to still be deemed 'classified.' However, the only reason this film is getting so much attention during Awards Season is mainly because it deals with such a climactic moment in American history and not because the film itself is actually any more worthy of an Oscar than any other military/action-like film like, say, 'The Avengers.' To not nominate it might be seen as 'un-American.' There is a reason why Bigelow did not get an Oscar nomination for Best Director: the film is simply not even close to being worthy of such a distinction. That being said, Jessica Chastain's highly-lauded performance as the CIA agent simply known as 'Maya' who is believed to have been the mastermind behind the discovery of bin Laden's hideout is even more overrated than the film itself. Yet somehow, she is the front-runner for the Academy Award for Best Actress.Usually an extraordinary talent (most deserving for her nomination for 'The Help'), Chastain's cardboard performance is utterly one-dimensional. Her lack of emotion or personality throughout the film made me think the role could have as easily been played by even the most dynamic of actresses, Kristen Stewart (read: sarcasm). As much as I was swept up in learning so much about the efforts that were made to capture this horrific individual, Chastain's performance from beginning to end left me wondering why exactly she would even be considered for an Oscar, never mind being a front-runner.And alas, there is a good chance the Golden Guy will go to the second-least-deserving of the lot when three of the other performances nominated were actually nothing less than exceptional.Technical nominations aside, the only truly deserving nominee of the bunch is Mark Boal, whose screenplay is based on intel collected by clearly rigorous research.Many will be enthralled by this film. However, I highly doubt it will be because of the production value and more so for the information contained in its details. Thankfully, Bigelow has no chance of stealing an Oscar away from a far more deserving nominee for a second time. However, this time, that distinction has a good chance of falling in the hands of Chastain.",7,3,8,22 January 2013
Joker," Kind of a letdown....
","The reviews here are making this film out to be far better than it actually is. Don't get me wrong, technically, it is extremely well done and Phoenix's performance is really quite extraordinary (he is definitely looking at an Oscar nomination), but despite excellent writing, acting and direction........the film is kinda boring.It had its moments, and, sure, it has some very disturbing elements but....If I had a watch, I would have looked at it many times as what this film lacks is...excitement.The final act is most excellent, but it felt like it took forever to get to it.",7,389,779,5 October 2019
Dark Shadows," Despite an excellent performance by Depp, like his character, the film is just a little lifeless.
","Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have a long, quirky history spanning over twenty years now, from the brilliant ('Edward Scissorhands') to the disappointing ('Alice in Wonderland'). And although both have a resume with more positives than negatives, Burton still directed 'Planet of the Apes' while Depp should desperately want to take 'The Tourist' off his list (and while he's at it, every single Caribbean movie).So, when 'Dark Shadows' was announced some time ago, I was sceptically excited, as I assumed it would probably be great, but hey, both names have stumbled. Then Michelle Pfeiffer got added to the mix, and anticipation grew (because, c'mon, MICHELLE PFEIFFER!) and then Chloe Grace Moretz! Suddenly, May 11th, 2012 was steaming with excitement for me! So, now that the day has come and gone, how do I feel? Well, to be honest, slight disappointment.'Dark Shadows,' based on the uber-cheesy series which aired from 1966 to 1971, has all the right ingredients, but instead of cooking it on high, it was brought to a boil on medium, and thus watching it sadly became tedious at times. A few bubbles would pop up, but then you go back to watching a film that slowly heats up as you look at the clock.Barnabas Collins, as played by Depp, returns to Collinsport in 1972 after having spent two centuries underground, having been put there by a witch, Angelique. After being dug up by an excavation crew (who suffer the consequences dearly), Collins returns to the house he built to find his descendant s still live there, although not nearly as lavishly as when he was 'alive.' Head of the household Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, played beautifully in a more-than-welcome return of the magnificent Michelle Pfeiffer, is struggling to keep the family above water. When Collins arrives and persuades her that he is who he says he is, she opens the doors to the family home to him on his promise that he will revive the family fortune.A fortune taken away by the very witch that entombed him.I have felt over the last few years that Depp had pretty much exhausted every quirky character he could. The biggest disappointment of 'Alice in Wonderland' was that, for the first time, he brought nothing original to a role. It was merely an amalgamation of characters we had already seen him do. Such is not the case with Barnabas Collins. As a vampire waking up in 1972, I cannot think of a more perfect actor to play the fish-out-of-water scenario than Depp, and his execution was exquisite.To see Pfeiffer back on the big screen (her last starring role in a major film was 2007's brilliant 'Stardust') is nothing short of a dream, and her role as the family matriarch is nothing short of perfect. And the woman still looks phenomenal.Chloe Grace Moretz ('Kick-Ass,' 'Hugo') never ceases to amaze me, and I cannot help but think this young lady could fill the gap left by Lindsay Lohan....that of a young actress with so much incredible acting talent, you cannot help but see Oscars in her future. As rebellious daughter Carolyn, Moretz absolutely controls every single scene she appears in.Of course, for comic relief, the always pitch-perfect Jackie Earle Haley as Willi Loomis, not to mention Eva Green's just-fine performance as witch Angelique and an impressive major-motion picture debut by 'Neighbour''s alum, Bella Heathcote.So, with all this star power and direction by Tim Burton, why is my reaction not complete exasperation? As I said, the film just moves far too slowly. Despite excellent performances all around, a great story, a script that is clever and crisp and refreshingly funny while staying absolutely true to the concept of the original series in every way, it may have tried a little too hard to be as quirky and cheesy as the TV series, thus lending to a film that seems like an episode that was stretched just a wee bit too long. The whole knock at 1972 never becomes tiresome or less amusing, even though the film itself does as time drags on.So, that is the one critique I have. A film filled with excellence in acting, writing and, with incredible special effects and outstanding cinematography, an absolute visual pleasure! But, despite all this, it just sadly took too slow a pace to get to the point. So, the film is good. Not great, but good, simply because Burton focused on the ingredients, and while doing a superb job, simply forgot to turn up the heat.",7,2,7,12 May 2012
Rango," Wow, a Western that didn't suck!
","Not being a fan of Westerns, having been bored by a film in the last year that even introduced aliens into the mix and still not capturing my attention, you can imagine my tentativeness to sit through 'Rango.' However, I was surprisingly impressed by the oddness of it all.'Rango,' a film clearly more directed at adults more than children, is an amusing look at a chameleon named Lars who is mistakenly dropped off a car in the middle of the desert who finds himself in Dirt, a stereotypical Western town in the middle-of-nowhere. Fearing the lawlessness of the town, a convenient lie enraptures Lars in a heroic quest to find water for the town before it dries up completely after a faked act of heroism leads the townsfolk to believe he is Rango, fearless and worthy of being town sheriff.After a few missteps by Johnny Depp, who voices the titular character, he finally found an entertaining way to deliver his almost-too-obvious quirkiness of late.Still not on the level of some of the great animated features of the last twenty years, 'Rango,' which won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, is definitely the best offering the genre had to offer in 2011. Hell, if it won this Western-hating sceptical over, John Logan's script must have done something right, if not Gore Verbinski's wonderful direction.",7,0,1,10 March 2012
Step Up," Skip this and just rent 'Save the Last Dance'
","Please do not think for a moment that I feel 'Save the Last Dance' is some cinematic epitome of greatness, because it isn't. What is it, however, is a film that was pretty useless all around, but had enough good 'stuff' in it to make it very entertaining.'Step Up' not only lacked all that 'stuff,' but the dancing was horrible too! Last time I checked, if a movie is going to be about dance, the dancing part SHOULD be impressive, no? I am not one to diss films for being formulaic or overly contrived, as I love many movies which are just that, but if you are not going to add anything NEW to a medium, it should at least be done well.This film is almost like a terrible remake of 'Save the Last Dance' gone wrong. The story was completely ridiculous, if not totally implausible. The dance sequences were boring and uninspired, like a bad week on 'So You Think You Can Dance.' Even the music was predominantly made up of really horrible, generic RnB. They hit on way too many clichés (including black man with gun, non-understanding parent, overworked-absent mom) and not once in this film would anyone begin to care about these stupid people so when there is the obligatory dramatic death of a young one, all it does is make you roll your eyes at how mundane every aspect of this movie is. Even the editing was terrible with so many bad cuts and continuity problems, I wondered if the director was even awake sometimes.Channing Tatum stars and I was hoping to see him show some acting chops, but all he did was prove he can play a white boy wannabe reallybadly. And he's not that great of a dancer. There is no doubt that the ex-Abercrombie model is gorgeous, but even that wasn't enough to really make this movie worth sitting through. If he is going to have any future, he's going to have to stop appearing in crap films like this and 'She's the Man,' learn to act and not think that his perfectly sculpted face is going to get him anything more than a few more fluffy film roles until he fades away and regrets giving up modeling.",3,2,3,26 March 2007
The Woman in Black," Entertaining but Nothing New.
","'The Woman in Black' is by no means a stroke of brilliance, nor will it really scare you in the theatre or haunt you after the credit roles, but as far as good 'ole ghost stories go, it's a pretty good film.Based on the 1983 book by Susan Hill and a remake of Herbert Wise's 1989 film, the story is about a grieving widower, a lawyer named Arthur Kipps, facing severe financial problems, who must take leave from his son and attend to the estate of a deceased woman, only to find her property to be the source of much fear in the small town in which she resided. As Kipps begins to discover as the secrets hidden in the history of the family which lived in the home, he learns that the threat of a ghost and its ties to the death of numerous children may very well be more real than he had feared.The film features some interesting yet clichéd bumps in the night, but under the direction of relative newcomer James Watkins, 'The Woman in Black' does unfold in a nice, well-paced, terribly creepy manner, although does not really bring anything new to the genre. The inclusion of uncensored death of children is somewhat of a refreshing twist (usually such stories try not to make death of non-adults nearly as graphic) but overall, the film is not going to go down in history as a brilliant twist on the genre. I give it credit for not having a stereotypical ending and the film does include some seriously beautiful cinematography.As for Daniel Radcliffe? In his first post-Potter role, many are commenting on the fact that he didn't really stray as far away from his well-known past as much as he should have, but not being a terribly big fan of the Potter films, having thus seen only the first three, I think Radcliffe does an excellent job here. I did not feel that I was watching Harry Potter for the length of the film and, hey, for the first time ever, there were moments that I thought Radcliffe was actually, dare I say it, looking kind of sexy. With his very expressive face, no doubt honed through many a take on previous sets in which he needed to exude fear, he portrayed the downtrodden and almost helplessly sad Kipps with almost mathematical execution.'The Woman in Black' may not be the dawning of a new age of ghost stories, but it does prove to be a great spring board for Radcliffe as he dives into the next phase of what could be a very impressive acting career.",7,2,5,5 February 2012
Cloud Atlas," You don't have to walk out completely understanding it to truly appreciate it.
","I walked into the cinema having pretty much no clue what I was about to see. All I really knew about 'Cloud Atlas' was that it was co-directed by what used to be the Wachowski Brothers but is now the Wachowski Siblings (the team responsible for the Matrix trilogy and 'Speed Racer' before Larry Wachowski became Lana Wachowski) along with Tom Tykwer ('Perfume: The Story of a Murder'). Oh, and that it was apparently a singular story that spanned centuries with numerous big-name actors playing a multitude of parts in a multitude of eras. And it had a running time of just under three hours.Ouf.Alas, with murmuring of Oscar possibilities and the talk of incredible visuals, my cinematic obligation superseded my hesitation. And I have no regrets.In reality, 'Cloud Atlas' is a myriad of interlocked stories unfolding through half a dozen eras spanning from the late 1800s to the distant future through almost seventy characters played by just a dozen actors and extraordinary visual effects that must be seen on the IMAX screen.Tom Hanks and Halle Berry lead the charge, playing a dozen completely dissimilar characters, some with similar traits, each creating their personas with such pronounced detail, from the selfish, conniving doctor to the almost-worshipped 'alien' visitor, accents ranging from British to Queens to 'Nell'-like mumbo-jumbo, but never leaving you batting an eye while you think about scratching your head. British heavyweights Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, James D'arcy and Hugh Grant with UK lightweight Ben Wishaw all bring such incredible life to nearly three dozen characters of all ages, sex and sexual proclivity. Susan Sarandon? Always a pleasure.And then there is relative newcomer Doona Bae who also slips into a half dozen characters, yet all but steals the show as Fabricant Sonmi-451. If there was a first possibility of a Best Supporting Actress nomination, it goes to Bae for playing a non-human who finds humanity within, portrayed through exquisite physical control and expression. The visual execution of the film is one of the most extraordinary to hit the big screen in some time, jumping from London in the 1800s to California in the 70s to a distant-future Seoul and a post-apocalyptic wasteland that bridges the past to the future. And the directors and editor, Alexander Berner, manage to jump from one to the other almost seamlessly, despite the polarizing images of environment and segues of triumph, love, passion, tenderness, disaster and unforgiving violence.So, all this leads to the question 'What is 'Cloud Atlas' about?'To tell you the truth, I have no idea where to even begin. And if I tried, it could ruin the experience for anyone who chooses to undertake the task. Even Roger Ebert wrote 'I gave up any attempt to work out the logical connections between the segments, stories and characters.' Indeed, they are connected, but to try to figure out how they truly overlap is another story. This is a film that one needs to see a few times and will still probably not figure it out. But unlike last year's 'Tree of Life,' which not only made no sense, was suicide-inducingly boring and pointless, the viewer walked away angry that they wasted two hours of their lives on crap-posing-as-art, 'Cloud Atlas' will leave you elated, satisfied and hopeful, even if you walk on not quite being able to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. It all culminates into an extremely emotional crescendo regardless of whether you find yourself lost or not.What I can say is that it is about Truth. And what one will do to cover Truth, discover Truth, run from the Truth, embrace the Truth, repent from the Truth and how heroes are willing to die to expose the Truth.And love. Love between a man and a woman, love between two men, love between parent and child, love between human and non-human. That love is love and it should never, ever be considered 'forbidden.' And that, my friends, is the Truth.",8,7,14,30 October 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Um, no, 'Cabin in the Woods' is NOT a 'horror' film....but it IS a great comedic satire.
","First off, for those who have seen the film, or just the previews, and wonder why the uber-hunky Chris Hemsworth's hair is short when he needs it long for his current stint as Thor, 'Cabin in the Woods' was actually filmed in 2008 and then sat on the shelf for three years due to MGM going bankrupt. And being a so-called 'horror' film, it was never a priority. Alas, it finally saw the light of day, which leads me to my next point...Which is, well, secondly, 'Cabin in the Woods' is not really a 'horror' film. Many are giving it high praise for being a completely original entry into the genre, some calling it one of the best horror films ever made. And, well, sorry, but they are all wrong, as this film is not actually a horror film. It is a comedy and a satire OF horror films, but due to the concept, there is absolutely nothing horrifying about it. At all. Nope, not even remotely scary.Why is that? Because I've seen literally hundreds upon hundreds of horror films? Well, as that could be true, it is actually because the horror and fear factor is stripped completely because everything you see on screen is controlled.The story is simple. Five stereotypical horror clichés get together and head to a...you guess it...cabin in the woods which resembles the one used in the greatest horror film ever made, 'Evil Dead,' almost exactly. However, it is no coincidence each character is a stereotype nor that they got pulled to this cabin in particular. Without giving the plot away completely, I'll say as much as you learn within the first ten minutes of the film: everything that will happen at the cabin is being controlled underground by a bunch of weird dudes, led by an awesome Richard Jenkins.So, knowing anything that happens to these five kids is being totally controlled, any hint of fear or 'horror' is completely stripped from this film. Why is it being controlled? Well, to learn THAT, you need to see the film.That being said, the film is well worth the watch. Even though it turned out to not be quite what I expected, 'Cabin in the Woods' is definitely an original concept based on horror film clichés deriving from everything from 'Evil Dead' to 'Halloween' to 'Night of the Living Dead' to the early writings of H.P. Lovecraft. It has a good cast of stereotypes, led by the aforementioned (and 'smaller,' but still gorgeous) Chris Hemsworth and Jessie Williams of 'Grey's Anatomy' fame....along with a COMPLETELY out-of-left-field cameo by a huge-named actress whose appearance I won't spoil.Hilarious in its self-referential and 'Scream'-like laughing at the predictable aspects of so many horror movies, this non-scary horror film satire does start off a little slow, but keeps the laughs and grins coming until it kicks into high gear as you learn the secrets behind the cabin and the film truly takes off into an extremely enjoyable second act with a sequence of such amusing slaughter, it teeters on being one of the greatest in history.So, definitely not the best 'horror' film ever made, but definitely the best satirical look at the genre since the first 'Scream.'",8,11,26,14 April 2012
