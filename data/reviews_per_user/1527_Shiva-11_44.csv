Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Twenty five years and this is the best that Lucas could come up with?
","The Phantom Menace: After Naboo is blockaded by Imperial forces the planet's young ruler is faced with a difficult decision: does she give in to the aggressors, accept defeat and save the lives of her subjects or fight and risk destruction?I remember waiting in line with friends for hours to see Star Wars over twenty years ago, and have seen each parts of the trilogy many times since then.  Consequently, I was thrilled when Lucas announced that he was ready to start filming the prequels.  And on the day Menace was released, I once again found myself waiting in line for hours with friends, anticipating a great movie.  I've never been so disappointed.The Star Wars franchise is synonymous with special effects and this outing is no exception.  Unfortunately, whereas the fx have always been there to wow the audience they also bolster the story.  Here however they take center stage: the underwater scene, and the pod race scene for example, could easily have been cut in half without altering the plot (if you can call it that.) in any way. I kept expecting George Lucas to pop out at any moment and say 'See what we can do for your movie!'  The film also spends too much time and energy pandering to the kiddie set.Much like 'Return of the Jedi', 'Menace' succumbs to the 'cuteness-factor' whereby cuddly creatures are introduced to draw the kids in.   In this case, it comes in the form of Jar Jar Binks, a computer animated creature who speaks in a bastardized Jamaican patois.  I found him annoying from the moment he appeared and grew to loathe him within minutes - I kept praying he would be struck by an errant asteroid or cleaved in two by some psychotic alien.  No such luck.    Then there's the acting.There were several weak performances in Menace, the most noteworthy being Jake Lloyd - he gave such a wooden performance it sounded as though he was reading directly off cue cards.  Where was Haley Joel Osmont when they were casting? Ewan McGregor is also guilty of walking through his role and turning in a passionless performance.  What happened to the headstrong young jedi that we heard so much of in the later films?  If it wasn't for Natalie Portman, there would little to recommend about this film.Let us hope that they devote as much time to the plots for the next two movies as they do to special effects.",Null,1,2,16 May 2000

Catch Me If You Can," Crime doesn't pay! Unless of course you're really good at it...
","People have always delighted in the exploits of those individuals that flout convention (and the occasional law) often living vicariously through them. How else can one explain the fascination with gentleman skyjacker DB Cooper, who, in 1971, jumped out of an airplane with a $200 000 ransom and vanished. No one  with the exception of law enforcement  wanted him to get caught. But next to Frank Abagnale Jr. Cooper looks like a piker - half a decade earlier, Abaganalemade off with a far greater sum with nothing more than chutzpah, fast-talking and a great smile.  So what if he got caught?Frank Abagnale Jr.  learned early on that looks could be deceiving:  his parents' fairy tale romance didn't include a `happily ever after' ending and although Frank Sr claimed to know the secret to success, it continued to elude him.  Rather than be discouraged, Frank Jr. embraced these lessons and adopted deceit as his career, assuming the guise of doctor, lawyer, and pilot (among others).  Not content to look like a jet setter, Frank embarked on global cheque bouncing spree to the tune of $2.5 million that earned him a spot on the FBI's Most Wanted List - quite a feat for a 17-year-old high school drop out.Based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr's dalliances with the law as a teen con man, `Catch Me If You Can' is both adventure and comedy with a touch of cynicism (the whole collapse-of-the-nuclear-family angle).  The film has a bouncy, spirited soundtrack that supports and enhances the lightweight subject matter.  This, along with wonderful set and costume design help to faithfully establish that sixties feel. Subtle scoring, fluid editing and tight camerawork ensure that the pacing is consistent and flows smoothly. This attention to detail is carried on by the cast.This is the other Leonardo DiCaprio Christmas movie  the one with a modest budget, that wasn't years overdue, and didn't have everyone's tongue wagging about late night parties and blow-ups on the set.   After solid work in `What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' and `The Basketball Diaries', DiCaprio became the flavor of the moment with `Titanic' (one of the most overrated movies of all time) and his credibility went into decline with roles in `The Beach' and the abysmal  `Man in the Iron Mask').   I braced myself for the worst and was therefore pleasantly surprised with his performance in this film: DiCaprio carries the role of Frank Jr. with aplomb, infusing Frank with the perfect balance of charisma, ballsy impertinence, humor and when necessary, gravity (without resorting to the broody scowling we've seen before).  His colleagues are no slouches either.His role as the spectacled ubergeek in `Blast From the Past' notwithstanding, Christopher Walken's characters are best known for their villainous tendencies. As Frank Sr., Walken is decidedly under whelming, a pitiable dim shadow of a man who labours under delusions that salvation is just around the corner.  Walken ensures that his character doesn't cross the line into useless pathetic, rather he exists as a cautionary tale to blind optimism.  Equally understated, and yet simultaneously outstanding, is Tom Hanks as Carl Hanratty, Frank Jr's dogged FBI foil.  Carl  a composite of several of the individuals who tracked Abagnale  is a quiet, determined loner who carries a few too many pounds and revels in the chase. Hanks brings the same quintessential every-man quality to the role that he is famous for, without looking like his character is a rehash from some other film. This is one of those rare films that has virtually no swearing, violence or nudity (there are a few suggestive scenes) and yet doesn't moralize or try to drown the viewer in saccharine.  In addition, it is fun, engaging, and well acted.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to be entertained.",8,2,3,25 December 2002
The Ring," Could have been a ringing endorsement. Too bad...
","It's that time of year again when the leaves are turning kaleidoscopic colors, the air is tinged with the crisp scent of renewal and brain busting midterms are once again a distant painful memory. It also means that we will be bombarded with ads for half-baked horror flicks that have been gathering dust on studio shelves, in the vain hope of scaring up some cheap Halloween thrills. Worse yet, the gullible masses will inevitably take the bait. 
Everyone is shocked when Rachel Keller's teen aged niece literally drops dead for no apparent reason. An investigative reporter, Rachel's curiosity is piqued when she is hears that Katie and three of her friends died after watching a cursed videotape. Determined to debunk an urban legend and make great copy in the process, Rachel inadvertently stumbles upon a sinister secret.  If she doesn't solve the ensuing mystery in seven days, not only will she blow her deadline, she dies. Nothing like a little incentive.Based on the 1998 Japanese film of the same name, The Ring rises above it's contemporaries: it doesn't rely on elaborate eviscerations, naked nubile teenagers or multimillion dollar CGI effects. The first hour of the film is a pure Hitchockian-style thriller with a supernatural bent, mixing disturbing surreal imagery with quick cut away shots and an eerie score to devastating effect (there were moments where the hairs on the back of my neck literally stood on end).  It's too bad that the remaining fifty minutes are a different movie.The second half of the film serves as a caveat for film makers on what not to do: introduce irrelevant characters, lose sight of your plot and allow it to ramble aimlessly, have a fake climax (that's never a good thing), and wrap with a predictable ending.  The biggest glitch however is the `villain' of the piece.Whether demon, psycho, monster or serial killer, there needs to be some underlying motivation that drives the antagonist to seek vengeance.  While the killer in The Ring was indeed wronged, it is never fully explained why this happened, and the victims are in no way associated with these events. Consequently, the antagonist's actions make no sense within the context of the film, especially when efforts to ameliorate these injustices only serve to magnify her rampage.  Regardless whether you prefer the thinking person's subtle horror stylings of The Sixth Sense or the pea soup expectorant head spinning of The Exorcist, The Ring will leave you unfulfilled and annoyed for having let you down.",6,1,2,16 October 2002
Erin Brockovich," Julia Roberts at her best.
","Erin Brockovich: Trying to raise three kids after two failed marriages with no job skills under a mountain of debt, while recovering from a car accident, would be enough to kill the spirit of most people. Not Erin Brockovich.  Gutsy, determined, and gifted with amazing people skills she manages to bully her way into a job at a law firm.   One day while doing some routine filing Erin comes across some information that seems out of place.  Her search to uncover its meaning leads her on a quest with monumental consequences.Based on a true story, it would have been easy to make a poor-woman-fights-against-system-and-everything-turns-out-wonderful-movie. Thankfully they didn't. Well paced and written, a great deal of time is devoted to character development. I was especially impressed that they did not try to make the main character warm and fuzzy.   Not since Mystic Pizza has Julia Roberts been given the chance to show that she can act - typecast as the vanilla cute, spunky heroine she has been coasting through her roles for years.  As Brockovich, Roberts is self-assured, dresses like a Frederick's of Hollywood model, throws around four letter words like a sailor, and has a temper worse than a pit bull. Most importantly, she is believable -Roberts slips so perfectly into the character that you almost forget it is her (maybe now she'll get the respect and the roles, that she deserves) some more serious offers.  Albert Finney, who plays her grizzled, cranky boss, is the perfect foil and together they are unstoppable. A careful blend of humor and drama Brockovich is worth full price.",Null,1,1,22 March 2000
Memento," What just happened?
","My memory isn't what it used to be: I put things down and don't remember where, I forget phone numbers, and wonder on my way to the bus stop if I turned off the kitchen faucet.   I can't blame these incidents on the morning-after-the-night-before syndrome, so I attribute the decline to one too many blows to the head, but subconsciously cringe because I know in the back of my mind that memory loss is supposed to get worse with age.  At least I think that's what they sayÂ…Leonard has a condition: after a violent attack in which his wife was killed, and he suffered a brain injury, Leonard was left with the inability to form short-term memories.  To keep track of people, places or things, he takes reams of Polaroids and writes endless notes to himself (some more indelible than others).   This, and the fact that he can never be sure if people are being straight with him, tends to make the search for his wife's killer a tad more difficult.'Memento' is one of those films that will, ironically, remind you of many others: it showcases elements of 'The Fugitive', 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Usual Suspects' and any number of film noir pieces.  What sets 'Memento' apart is not it's somewhat fractured timeline, or that it begins at the end, rather it is the total lack of certainty of any aspect of what is unfolding on screen.'Memento' plays on the idea that what we remember isn't necessarily what happened: if you ask two people why they were arguing, they may recall the major theme, but will typically remember specific details very differently. This is why police always take eyewitness testimony with a grain of salt, because they realize that recollections are suspect at the best of times. The film never lets you forget that.The entire premise of the film rests on whether you believe in Leonard's affliction and Guy Pearce leaves you with few doubts - his deft ability to switch from lucidity to blind rage to total confusion is totally convincing. However, although Leonard spends much of his time in a waking-dream-state he is not stunned and is able to focus and process his surroundings, evanescent though they may be (unless recorded).  The supporting cast is equally effective.Joe Pantoliano is his usually slimy self as Teddy - or is he?  We don't know why Teddy's helping Leonard or if he is.  And Pantoliano is slick enough that the viewer is hard pressed to say if he's a savior or Judas. Carrie-Anne Moss turns in her wordiest performance (even if many of them are four-lettered) yet as a mystery woman/kindred spirit/manipulator.  Again, the viewer is not sure about her character or motivation.  Is there anything the viewer can rely on in this film?  Short answer, yes, but you may not like it.While the director has gone to great pains to achieve an art-house film feel, there's no hiding the money that went into it.  The film's detailed visuals slick editing and subtle audio clues embedded in the soundtrack all serve to both distract and alert the viewer's attention.  The hard to pin down plot and concerted efforts by the writer to obscure any absolutes, including the inclusion of numerous red herrings requires that you pay strict attention to every detail.  Even then, I don't guarantee you'll catch everything (I know I didn't).This is a film for anyone who's tired of cookie-cutter plotlines, and wants a little fiber in their film diet.  When it's over, ask your movie buddy for their interpretation, buy tickets for the next screening, and repeat as necessary.",Null,0,0,25 March 2001
The 13th Warrior," A good good versus evil flick (Vikings are the good guys?)
","The 13th Warrior - Cultured Arabian poet gets mixed up with Vikings and monsters.  This may not sound like the best of plots but it is actually quite an enjoyable movie (okay, I may be a bit biased as it was filmed nearby).  Granted there are some big continuity errors - daylight suddenly turns to night, Ibn Fadlan (Antonio Banderas) learning Norse by listening to the Vikings etc. and a few plot holes (we don't really find out much about the enemy or their origins).  But hey, I'm big enough to get past all that.
Warrior boasts gorgeous scenery, the best battle scenes since Braveheart (only here they're darker and grittier, more reminiscent of Excalibur ) and some very funny dialogue (thankfully it's intentional).  I was glad to see that they employed a lot of Nordic actors that speak Swedish and Norwegian as it makes the movie a lot more believable (nothing ruins a movie for me more than lines delivered in foreign languages with abysmal accents).  If you enjoy movies in this genre (mythical/battle) or just think Banderas is to die for you will like this flick.Tuesday night or matinee.",Null,0,0,28 August 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Abandon all misgivings ye who enter
","Say `Pirate Movie' in a crowded theater and you're likely to be facing a mutiny or a stampede, and for good reason:  the rollicking adventures popularized by Robert Louis Stevenson and brought to life by Errol Flynn have, of late been replaced by overblown soulless drivel along the lines of Polanski's `Pirates' or `Cutthroat Island'.  Jerry Bruckheimer and Johnny Depp to the rescue.Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is quite likely the unluckiest pirate alive:  after  having suffered the ignominy of mutiny and being marooned, he finds his way to port in the one town that has a serious hate on for pirates.  If that weren't enough to spoil his already bad day, Sparrow is thrown back into the fray when he promises young Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) that he will help rescue Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the young woman kidnapped by  Sparrow's  old enemies.  Oh, and there's that pesky little curse to contend withLet me state from the outset -  this is a fantastic movie that epitomizes what a summer movie should be.  It features  oodles of action  both in the form of swashbuckling sword fights and big time explosions, is packed full of accessible humor, boasts great special effects (note: not gratuitous), has beautiful and eerie locations, nasty villains, reformed heroes and fantastic performances.  Am I making it clear that I liked this movie?Orlando Bloom is solidly low key in his first post `Lord of the Rings' outing, and makes good use of the martial skills he leaned while filming the trilogy.  His character is equal parts tragic and noble, and he balances these  the facets well.  While Elizabeth could be rightly classified as the obligatory damsel-in-distress of the piece, she most certainly is not helpless  Knightley brings the same determined  empowerment that she displayed in `Bend it Like Beckham'.   You have to give props to any woman who can act and kick butt while bound in a corset and frilly fluffy dresses (and yet somehow manages to look even more beautiful while doing so  forgive me, I'm only human). Geoffrey Rush is deliciously devilish as Captain Barossa the dark hearted scoundrel of the piece, the, who dispenses death the with a smile.  You know he's bad just by looking at the man's teeth!  And then there's the Depp factor.Johnny Depp could long ago have been a major Hollywood star  he certainly has the charisma, the drive and enough  talent for a few careers  however he's made a conscious decision to stick with character driven  films, which are often only found in artsy or  edgy films.  Thankfully  he chose to tackle this role with the same fervor Depp is hilarious as John Sparrow, the glib roguish pirate cursed with a streak of goodness and bad luck, who seemingly dances between madness and lucidity.   To say that his portrayal binds the film would not be indulging in hyperbole, as he brings all the elements of the story and the characters together.  Is that all there is you might ask?  Not even close.
****Okay, I'm going to give you a warning here  if  you haven't seen the trailers some potential spoilers lay  ahead****.
 The CGI work in this films is remarkable on several fronts:  the film does not rely upon them, they are not excessive and they actually enhance the film.  The characters'  transition from human to skeleton and back (there sequences are rapid and many) are amazingly fluid and realistic.  Need more? The swordfighting are beautifully choreographed, the city sets are brilliant, the pyrotechnics in the battle scenes are pure Buckheimer (read: big, loud, and many) and the film is also fit for the youngsters.If you're in the market for a film that will appeal to anyone between the ages of  5 to 95 , look no further.",7,3,6,8 July 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," This is a movie for South Park fans - others need not attend
","South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut - Your favorite grade school kids curse even more after seeing their heroes in a movie.   To combat the problem, the mothers of South Park unite and ground their kids, have the stars of the film arrested and declare war on Canada.Holy *&%#! This film sets out to shock you in the first few minutes and the swearing flies fast and furious - we're talking language that would make a sailor blanch.  In addition, there are some themes that they could never touch on the TV.Cursing aside, Parker and Stone convey an important message in this movie: parents need to spend more time with their kids and know what they're doing, rather than expecting the government to act as a babysitter with ever encroaching legislation (at least that's what I gather they were doing).Even diehard fans will tire of all the musical numbers (Sound of Music this ain't) but nonetheless they will probably enjoy this film.  If you are not already a fan , I suggest you watch a few TV episodes to prime yourself for the experience. WARNING - this movie is not suitable for kids or anyone who is easily offended.",7,2,3,30 June 1999
Chicken Run," Run to see this movie!
","Chicken Run: The poultry population of Tweedy's farm has grown tired of being slaves to production and is determined to escape.  Unfortunately every attempt has either failed or been foiled.  They're given renewed hope with the arrival of Rocky, a swaggering American rooster who agrees to teach them how to fly in exchange for shelter.In a climate where computer animation has become the standard, it is refreshing to see what can be done with simple clay figures.  Produced by the team that created the Oscar winning 'Wallace and Gromit' series, Chicken Run uses stop motion photography, a craft generally relegated to realm of animation festivals.  This is the first time this technique has been used in a full feature big budget movie and I was amazed at the versatility of the medium: the range of expressions and actions is amazing.  I can only imagine how much effort it took to create this picture but I'm glad they did.It is very difficult to try to categorize this movie as it s so different from the standard Hollywood fare.  For example, the marketing campaign has been brilliant - rather than simply showing trailers with snippets of the movie, they have crafted hilarious parodies of both MI:2 (people were screaming in delight when this trailer was shown before MI:2) and Gladiator. And unlike so many instances where the trailers are better than the movie, Chicken Run delivers.The story, which pays homage to such classic films as 'The Great Escape', 'Stalag 17' and 'Star Trek', is well written, engaging and has elements that will appeal to both young and old alike.  The characters have more depth than many I've seen in live action films: whether you're drawn to Rocky, the cocky upstart with a secret, Ginger, the driven saviour of the group who yearns for freedom, or the crotchety old Colonel, you will find someone you can relate to.   The humor runs the gamut from subtle, to the absurd and it comes fast and furious  - the audience rarely stopped laughing.   Finally, the pacing is excellent - there are few lulls in the action and they don't rely on unnecessary filler to bridge the scenes.I don't know that this movie will be a blockbuster (read $200 million) but it is already on my top ten list for this year, and I think it will prove to be the 'Iron Giant' for 2000.   If you're looking for a well-rounded family movie, look no further.",7,0,0,19 June 2000
X-Men," Holy mutants Batman! A good comic book movie.
","X-Men:  The next phase in human evolution has given rise to a select group who possesses a wide range of unusual abilities: telekinesis, super-healing, and morphing are only a few examples.  Unfortunately, there is a movement among the 'normal' people - afraid of what they do not understand - to have these 'mutants' register so they can be identified, tracked and their powers documented.  Two mutants emerge as leaders with radically different agendas - one seeks peaceful coexistence with the rest of humanity - the other domination.Whenever a book is adapted for the big screen there is bound to be controversy over casting or content - legions of fan were livid with the choice of Tom Cruise for the role of Lestat in 'Interview With a Vampire'. To a lesser degree, this has also applied to comic book adaptations ('Spiderman', 'Superman', we won't even touch 'Batman'), but none approaching the level of debate which raged over 'X-Men'.  It was not just a question of who would be cast, but which characters should be included, what they should wear (people were livid that the characters would not be clad in body hugging spandex), how close they should be to the comic book characters, etc.  Consequently, I would be stunned if anyone is totally happy with all the characters - I know I wasn't.Toad gets far too much screen time and his prehensile tongue schtick quickly grows tiresome, Sabretooth isn't very menacing (they couldn't find a bulked up Behemoth with a little more screen presence? Kane (?) from the WWF comes to mind) and the May/December relationship between Jean Grey and Cyclops doesn't jibe.  I did however think Hugh Jackman was superb as Wolverine, delivering the right balance of pathos and rage.  Patrick Stewart's Xavier is a cool as ice (he got a lot of practice as Captain Picard on Star Trek), soft-spoken diplomat.  Finally, Sir Ian McKellen is almost regal in his portrayal as Magneto the wonderful gentleman villain with a nasty disposition (but couldn't they have given him a better hat?  I bet that's why he has such an attitude problem).  But you're probably wondering 'What about the movie itself?'  All in good time Rather than go for a gaudy 'comic book' look ('Dick Tracy'), or a decaying and depressing landscape ('Batman'), 'X-men' has a realistic feel: it takes place a few years in the future in a recognizable New York.  The story is engaging and accessible, examining the concept of intolerance - although here it is not skin color (in most cases) or religion that is the focus - which captures headlines everyday, and is quite simple to grasp.   Just to ensure that the movie doesn't get too heavy, there are quite a few clever puns and one-liners sprinkled throughout to provide some levity.   And let's not forget the action.There are several excellently choreographed action sequences, most notably the battle between Mystique and Wolverine.  The experience is heightened by excellent cinematography, stop motion and slow motion photography, and impressive special effects (morphing technology continues to improve). 
X-Men will not satisfy everyone, but it does deliver a finely crafted story, good acting and is without a doubt one of the best comic-book-to-screen translations to date. And there will be a sequel.",7,0,0,16 July 2000
Sleepy Hollow," The Depp/Burton duo scores again
","Sleepy Hollow: When the New York judiciary grows tired of a Ichabod Crane, an inspector who believes in justice of all things, they dispatch him to a small New England town to solve a series of ghastly murders.  What appears to be a routine investigation of a serial killer that likes to hack off heads turns sinister when it becomes evident that the murderer may not be human. First, this is not Disney's version of Irving's classic tale- it is dark, gory, and scary. Indeed it is not really Irving's story anymore, with several of the main details having been changed.   Finally, this version is extremely well executed (no pun intended).After such fantastic debacles as 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' 'The Astronaut's Wife', and  'Mars Attacks' it is a pleasure to see Depp and Burton back together again.  Depp is wonderful as Crane, the, pale, skittish, intelligent man of few words (you might call him Ichabod Scissorhands) trying to uncover a killer as he tries to understand his own past.  Ricci, meanwhile, is enchanting, as the mysterious seductress and leaves you wondering - is she good or evil?  And Walken is darker than he's ever been - a man whose dedication to evil and killing actually brings him back from the dead.  But acting alone does not make a movie.Burton masterfully translates his vision to the screen, creating an atmosphere that is spectacularly gloomy, oppressive, and enticing at the same time.  In addition to fabulous sets, and great action sequences, the film is remarkably well paced with no wasted scenes or downtime - I was amazed how quickly it was over.   I will be adding this to my collection!",8,0,0,18 February 2000
Snatch," Lock, Stock, and Many Smoking Barrels
","The release of Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' in 1994 prompted a schism in the staid gangster movie genre: the standard hallmarks - serious characters, gunfights, intrigue and damsels in distress - were enhanced with snappy dialogue, and gallows humour.  The biggest change however was the introduction of the mobius strip-style plot line, where the concept of time is no longer linear, instead constantly folding in upon itself, flitting between past, present and future that forces the viewer to pay close attention lest they miss some subtle detail.  Inevitably, numerous copycat films emerged that tried to capitalize on Tarantino's success, but it wasn't until 1998 when Guy Ritchie, an unknown British director, took on the challenge that a successor was found.  Now Ritchie is determined to prove that his first time out wasn't a fluke.Turkish is a young man with an entrepreneurial bent, who, when he's not running his gambling operation, manages bareknuckle boxers.  Through a business deal gone wrong, he becomes acquainted with one Mickey O'Neil, a mumbling manic motor-mouthed piker who also happens to be a one-punch marvel.  Turkish persuades Mickey to join his stable of fighters, but soon discovers that Mickey has his own agenda, and gets Turkish in trouble with the gangsters who run the underground boxing circuit.  Other characters that become involved in the drama include a four-fingered degenerate gambler/jewel thief, a vicious boxing promoter, a gang of inept robbers, a polite hitman, a crazed Russian gun runner, a group of Irish gypsies, a crooked New York jeweler and a pugnacious pet.  The common thread binding them all is a perfect diamond the size of a peach pit.  If you aren't confused yet, you soon will be.'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', Mr. Madonna's (Ritchie) first film, was shot on a small budget, with a no-name cast (except for football bad boy Vinnie Jones) and quickly became a rousing success at home and found receptive audiences abroad.  While not a technically a sequel 'Snatch' is stylistically very similar to 'Lock, Stock':  Ritchie utilizes his trademark bombastic staccato sequences, and repeatedly bounces off on radical tangents to throw the viewer off balance.  He did however opt for a decidedly darker satirical tone in this film, that may make some people uncomfortable (think 'Very Bad Things').  What struck me as particularly daring was his decision to create a story with such a voluminous cast.
Ritchie faced a daunting task with this film: how, with roughly twenty principal characters, does one adequately flesh out each character, and not hopelessly confuse the audience?  The feat was made doubly difficult, as several cast members are big name stars.  Somehow Ritchie manages - each actor is full bodied, receives ample screen time, and no one character is the centerpiece.  With so many talented actors, it is difficult to pick out one performance that stands out:  Rade Serbedzija is hilarious as the mad Russian who blithely burns through each of his nine lives, as is Vinnie Jones' manic gentleman hitman.  On the other end of the spectrum, is Alan Ford as Brick Top, the promoter with a penchant for pigs, who epitomizes cold-blooded viciousness. If forced to pick my favorite however, I would have to go with Brad PittPitt resurrects his trailer trash look from 'Kalifornia' and adopts a nearly indecipherable brogue that sounds like my best friend's Uncle Wally on a bad day.  As Mickey O'Neil, the hard drinking wily grifter and part-time pugilist, Pitt displays a wide range of emotions, demonstrating again that he is not only a star, but also a gifted character actor.  And I would be remiss if I didn't mention the dog that subtly stole every scene he appeared in.While 'Snatch' initially struggles to find its stride, and is very similar to Ritchie's earlier film, it is fresh and funny enough to make you forget any minor shortfalls and stand on its own.",8,111,140,14 January 2001
The Beach," I'll take sand in my shorts over watching this mess again
","The Beach: Every backpacker is in search of untouched paradise, that one place that would make every postcard vendor salivate. Unfortunately, anyplace that remotely fits the bill is usually overrun with drunken revelers, package tourists and golden arches.  When Richard, a jaded traveler, acquires a map with the location of a secret pristine beach he is determined to find it, regardless the risks.  Which begs the question, what is the price of paradise?Since Titanic Di Caprio has been damned, dismissed and denigrated.  His detractors have obviously forgotten his performances in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Romeo and Juliet.  Di Caprio deserves to be judged on his individual efforts and not prejudged for having been in a blockbuster. That said, he is horrible in this movie.  Or to be more accurate, this film as a whole is terrible.Beach attempts to be a fusion of Apocalypse Now and Lord of the Flies, only a lite version without the drama, irony, or introspection. The story is for the most part a sanitized, predictable muddled mess, except for the last 20 minutes, which are exceptionally outlandish -Richard's bouts with madness are laughable.   The commune consists of a bunch of elitist spoiled brats who live in tense harmony with a band of pot growers (given that drug growing and smuggling are capital offences in Thailand I'm sure this sort of thing happens all the timeÂ…) until things go wrong.  Big surprise.  Finally, although the star of the movie is beautiful (I'm talking the beach here), it is not worth the price of admission.Miss.",4,0,1,21 February 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," They said no one could do justice to LOTR - they were wrong!
","The successful adaptation of a best-selling novel to the big screen is a monumental undertaking with many variables to take into account. The first obstacle is the nature of the novel - while books allow for a virtually unrestricted level of depth, detail and perception the bounds of cinema are far more constrained, especially with regards to time. Another concern is how the story is told - should the director opt for a mirror telling of the (a la 'Harry PotterÂ…') or create his or her own interpretation and risk alienating the fans. There is also the matter of casting - every reader has their own preconceived ideas of what their favorite characters look like and who should play them - recall the imbroglio over the casting of Tom Cruise in 'Interview With The Vampire'. If the task does not yet seem daunting enough, imagine that you've chosen to film The trilogy that formed the keystone of the fantasy genre as we know it today, a series which has been read by over 100 million people over the past five decades. I'm sweating just thinking about it.When Frodo a young, carefree Hobbit, receives a ring as a 'gift' from his uncle, he has no idea of it's significance: forged in the  furnaces of Mount Doom, the ring will bestow unimaginable powers upon those who know its secrets and bend their will to evil. Frodo learns that the ring's creator, the dark lord Sauron, has risen again and has dispatched his forces over the land to find it. The only way to halt Sauron's reign is for the ring to be cast into the fires of Mount Doom and thereby destroyed. Thus, Frodo, with the help of his eight companions - wizards and warriors, of differing kinds and kin- embark on a perilous journey to save Middle Earth.Peter Jackson's plans to develop 'The Fellowship of the Ring' into a movie began over six years ago. He shopped the idea around Hollywood, but was repeatedly turned down by every major studio. When he approached New Line, he expected little more, and was told that not only could he make his film, they wanted the whole trilogy. Jackson was both astounded and ecstatic, and set to work, filming all three films simultaneously in order to ensure continuity among the cast and scenery, resulting in a grueling 18-month shoot. The effort was well worth it.****** Be warned - gushing & potential spoilers ahead*****
From the opening narrative, explaining the history of the ring you get the feeling of an epic unfolding before your eyes and the battle scene depicting the initial defeat of Sauron is phenomenal. The film then switches to the story of the passing of the ring, introducing several of the main characters and the Shire, and I felt as though Jackson knew the visions that I had in my head when reading the book.I don't know much about Elijah Wood's past performances, but he is excellent as Frodo - from his facial expressions, to his happy-go-lucky naivete and cheery voice he nails Frodo on every level, and continues to do so as the story  progresses. I cannot think of anyone else who could have captured his essence so purely. Ian McKellen is superb as Gandalf, the world-weary wizard, although he is a tad more lighthearted than his character in the book. McKellen shines (literally in at least one scene) in every scene, but his steadfast defiance in his battle against the Balrog sent shivers down neck ('being sniffed by the devil' as my mother used to say) . The scenes between Frodo and Gandalf are amplified by the difference in height between the two which are exaggerated for the film. Outstanding  performances abound.Viggo Mortenson is brilliant as Aragorn the ranger (he literally went native during the film, sleeping in the woods to get into his character), the scruffy warrior/savior with a secret. Liv Tyler is luminous as the almost ethereal female warrior Arwen and her lines, delivered almost exclusively in Elvish (the language was actually constructed for the film) are a melodic singsong. Christopher Lee, the classic Hollywood bad guy, is positively wicked and foreboding as the traitorous Saruman. Ian Holmes' conflicted Bilbo was somewhat tragic to behold, as you could see how his character had been eroded by the dark calling of the ring. The rest of the Fellowship also deliver thoroughly  engaging performances. I would be remiss if I neglected to mention the hideous marauding orcs, the monstrously powerful Uruk Hai and the faceless ringwraiths with their hair-raising banshee-like wails which would give nightmares anyone unlucky enough to encounter them (that's if they live to tell about it). The lands of Middle Earth are as integral to the story as are characters that dwell within them and as diverse.The lush greenery of the Shire with it's warren of hill holes looks so natural that it only follows that hobbits must live there - it is simply beyond question. Likewise, Rivendell and Lothlorien's serene settings are such that only a race as delicate and ageless as the Elves could be their inhabitants - anyone else would soil their purity. Balancing the beauty is the stark, terrifying ugliness of the Mines of Moria, with it's labyrinthine passages, and halls hewn from stone, which have been infested with the loathsome, scurrying creatures in the service of Sauron. The rendering of the scenes is, for lack of a better word, breathtaking.  Then there is  the netherworld of phantasms that Frodo enters whenever he puts on the ring - both mystical and terrifyingly beautiful.  There are however some concerns lurking amongst this perfection.The overall special effects are extremely well done, so much so, that the few scenes that aren't, notably the caverns of Isengard, and the burial of Boromir, are glaring. I was also curious why several sequences appeared milky and somewhat washed out, much like the look of the fantasy films of the 80's, as I did find it somewhat distracting. Finally, the film does plod on in certain sections, but mercifully only for short segments.These minor quibbles aside, I would not hesitate to recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good cinema. It is outstanding. Mr. Jackson has done what no one thought he could do - bring a masterpiece of literature to life. Kudos. I only regret that I'll now have to wait another year for the sequel.",8,0,0,21 December 2001
Cast Away," Once again Hanks demonstrates his dynamic range.
","Cast Away - Life inexorably flows by: whether it's slowing down while we're at work, or speeding up when we're at play, days blend into weeks and into years.  Not surprisingly, few people - especially those who would benefit from it most - ever take the time to engage in serious introspection.  If, however, the opportunity did present itself, what do you think you might learn?  Or would you even dare to try?Chuck Noland is obsessed by time: it's his job is to ensure that those packages that 'absolutely positively have to get there overnight' do, and he's willing to do what is necessary to get it done, even 'borrowing' a child's bike if necessary.  He loves his girlfriend, but their relationship is subject to the whims of his daytimer. Ripped away from yet another Christmas dinner for a quick job he gives his girlfriend a hurried kiss, tells her that he has something important to discuss with her and promises her he'll be right back.  Of course, time is relative.By now, everyone probably knows that this film is 'different' in several ways.  First, the concept and movie came before the witless 'Survivor' phenom, and many people were concerned that the show might taint the movie. Second, many people were hoping for a repeat after Zemeckis and Hanks struck box office gold with 'Forrest Gump'.  Third, after filming the beginning of the movie, the production went on hiatus for a year while Tom Hanks shed almost fifty pounds going from portly to waif (Zemeckis filled his time by filming 'What Lies Beneath').  Fourth, although there are peripheral characters, the bulk of the film focuses on Chuck's time alone on the island and consequently, dialogue is sparse.  There is also an absence of special effects (with the notable of exception of the superbly staged plane crash), and the soundtrack stops soon after Chuck crawls ashore.  Finally, the initial ending was scrapped after it garnered lukewarm responses from test audiences.I never dreamed that the cross dressing star of a cheesy sitcom would one day be one of Hollywood's biggest draws.  I'm sure he didn't either.  It is difficult for an actor to give a good performance at the best of times, but when you are playing off a volleyball, water and occasionally adverse weather conditions, the situation is far more challenging.  Hanks proves that he is up to the task.Even starker than Hank's amazing physical metamorphosis, is his spiritual and mental transformation. As his carefully ordered life disintegrates (whose wouldn't after being jetwrecked?) Chuck begins to understand that what is truly important in life, water, food and shelter not withstanding, is living, not just surviving. As he struggles with desperation, triumph, and insanity, he accepts that he cannot dictate what happens, only his response. Could this have been the subtle reason for titling the film 'Cast Away' (vb.- to dispose of something) rather than 'Castaway' (adj.- a shipwrecked individual)?   As I don't think I will be talking with speak with Mr. Zemeckis in the near future, it will remain unanswered.The location shots are both beautiful and treacherous - paradise with a hitch - and reminded me of some of the islands I visited while in Fiji (thankfully they had places to stay and food I didn't have to hunt down). The cinematography is tight, and Zemeckis deserves congratulations for his simple, understated, yet simultaneously daring direction (if only he'd shown such restraint in 'What Lies Beneath').  My only complaints would have to be that the beginning and ending feel too artificial when viewed in the context of the rest of the film, but not overwhelmingly so.One of the most powerful films of the holiday season.",7,0,0,22 December 2000
Pitch Black," If you want to be scared by nasty monsters, rent Aliens
","Pitch Black: A ship of interstellar colonists has their plans changed when they pass through the tail of a wayward comet.  They crash-land on a barren planet, with three suns, and no life, or at least that's what they're led to believe.  With an eclipse on the way, a killer on the loose and some scary creatures who come out only at night, things don't bode well for our heroes.I was impressed with the before-the-eclipse cinematography - the landscape was stark, blinding and essentially monochromatic, creating a feeling of desolation and desperation (I know I wouldn't want to be stuck there under any circumstances).  Second, the opening sequence is extremely well done - from the howling winds to the wild debris - the viewer feels like they are in the cockpit with the crew.   I also enjoyed Vin Diesel's performance as the murderer with a conscience.  Unfortunately, the movie never recaptures its momentum and becomes increasingly insipid. What exactly are the odds that you would crash-land on a planet with three suns, with a killer that can see in the dark the day before a total solar eclipse (that occurs once every two decades) engulfs the planet.  I'm guessing slim to none.  To make matters worse, the monsters, are without a doubt, the worst waste of computer animation I have ever seen.  Who dreamed up these walking anvils with teeth? I found them laughable rather than terrifying.  Finally, the ending was contrived and anti-climactic.

American Psycho," Doesn't cut it as serial killer thriller or witty satire
","American Psycho: In the heady eighties appearances were everything: consumerism was king, money was god and the towers of Wallstreet represented financial Sodom and Gomorrah.  Enter Patrick Bateman, investment banker extraordinaire: although he's similar to his colleagues - greedy, shallower than a puddle after an April shower, and a walking Calvin Klein ad - the only thing he likes better than dissecting pop songs is dissecting people.  As he explains it to one of his victims,  'I'm in murders and executions'.  Stable he is not. I find it ironic, and yet somewhat appropriate, that a movie about a serial killer set during Wallstreet's glory days is getting wide release when the markets are undergoing one of the worst bloodbaths in years. I haven't read Ellis' novel, but I remember vividly the outrage that followed its release - indeed, they tried to confiscate it at the border as obscene material.  Critics accused Ellis of reveling in blood and gore and creating a how-to book for serial killers. This movie is not that book. Harron (the writer/director) opted to shift the focus away from the killings and create a satire that highlights the excesses and obsessions of the era, for example, the scene where the characters compare their business cards feels almost pornographic.  Likewise, Patrick's constant analysis of pop music (he must intellectualize why he listens to it rather than simply enjoying it) is ridiculous as there is little substance to it at the best of times, but again it is an attempt to establish superiority and depth.
Christian Bale is electrifying as the narcissistic serial killer, but ultimately he is too good - his character is so bereft of humanity that he seems plastic and eventually becomes nothing more than a walking, stalking ken doll who is more laughable than menacing. What could have been a clever indictment of the Me Decade, ultimately fails for trying to be too clever and impersonal.",Null,1,2,16 April 2000
American Beauty," Great!
","American Beauty- A journey into the dysfunctional land of Middle America. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is in the throes of a mid-life crisis: he hates his job, has an antagonistic relationship with his shrewish, manic depressive wife (Annette Bening), his daughter hates him and he has a crush on his daughter's best friend.  And courtesy of the boy next door (whose family is even more messed up!) we get a step-by-step videography of Lester's therapy in action.The trailers for Beauty intrigued me, and I was thrilled to stumble on an advance screening.  I was not disappointed: Spacey delivers another in a long line of fantastic performances (the Usual Suspects, Seven, Swimming With the Sharks).  I tried to think of another actor who could have done this role, and drew a blank - Spacey just blends into his parts so well. This is his best work yet (not a statement to be made lightly).Bening gives her best performance since The Grifters - I have been so disappointed with her recent movies, as they simply failed to showcase her acting abilities.  This time she has a complex character she can really sink her teeth into.  Finally, the supporting cast does a fantastic job, most notably Wes Bentley as Ricky the stoic stream of consciousness drug dealer / philosopher next door.  Bentley's portrayal is bang on - expect to see a lot of him in the future.   The only thing that would make this movie better is.well, nothing frankly: the photography is, for lack of a better word, luscious - full and luxurious.  The plot is engaging, enthralling, and believable, and the pacing is perfect.  Go, now!",9,0,0,21 September 1999
The Fast and the Furious," Big, dumb, fast and fun
","Big dumb fast and fun.I was talking with a friend of mine who is into customizing cars  - he has a gorgeous Honda Accord that has a new addition every time I see him - when I saw the first trailers for this movie.  We agreed that there would be some great cars, gorgeous women, awesome racing sequences and people condemning the film for irresponsibly promoting street racing.  All our suspicions proved correct, but most surprising was the lateness of the negative publicity for the film - I didn't see an article until today (interesting side note, the author had been cruising the international custom car bulletin boards for weeks trying to get interviews, but no one would bite). 
Blond haired blue-eyed Brian Spindler is sent to find the people responsible for several precision big rig hijackings.  He searches for his quarry among the street racing gangs of LA, where he meets and tries to ingratiate himself with Dominic Torreto, the prince of the racing set.  Brian soon finds himself in the middle of a bubbling gang war, and is being pressured by his superiors to get a bust. Things get complicated when Brian finds himself falling for Dominic's sister and at odds with the other members of Dom's crew.  But just when he thinks things can't get any worse, Brian gets an unpleasant surprise.I'm not going to rave about an intricate plot, zippy well scripted dialogue or in-depth character studies, because they simply aren't present, indeed there are several laughingly bad lines, and the acting is generally subpar This film is about action, and the sequences are some of the best to grace the movie screen  in a long time:  the driving is phenomenal, that stunts are amazing (no digital enhancement here) and the cars are very impressive. Although the film is a little over the top in some aspects - not every car customizer uses Nitrous Oxide or races their cars (most would be terrified that they might scratch or god forbid crash, their cars)- I think they have managed to capture the spirit of this unique subculture.   The acting is definitely a mixed bag.I've enjoyed Vin Diesel's roles, even though I've not been that enamoured of the films he's been in.  In a recent interview, he explained that he's drawn to anti-heroes as he finds them more interesting than the white shirted good guys, and I tend to agree with his observations.  As Diesel recently stated, Dominic is a man of his word, who believes in honor, but happens to 'live outside the law' and his is the only character that is adequately fleshed out in the film.   Paul Walker plays Brian as possibly the most inept undercover cop to grace the screen - the only way he could stand out more in the group he's trying to infiltrate would be to wear a Village People costume.  Donnie Brasco he ain't.   This is exacerbated by the fact that Walker's portrayal is virtually bereft of any real emotion, and his soulless delivery of several corny lines renders them even worse than they were written- quite a feat.  The biggest disappointment for me was the waste of Michelle  Rodriguez - who distinguished herself in 'Girl Fight' - whose soul purpose is to linger on screen and scowl.  A tremendous waste of a valuable commodity.If you're looking for a punchy matinee, without a lot of dialogue or plot to get in the way, settle in for the ride.",6,0,1,23 June 2001
Pearl Harbor," Not a bomb, but lots of explosions.
","Pearl harborFor Europe, World War II began with Poland's invasion in 1939.  For China, it began eight years earlier with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. While the fighting waged abroad, the United States clung to its isolationist stance in the hope that these 'regional' conflicts would be decided without them.  This laissez-faire attitude was shattered at 8:00 am on December 7th 1941 with the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.   While the intention was to immobilize the US fleet before they could become a factor in the Pacific Theater, it instead served to galvanize a nation.
True friendship is a rare commodity, something that Danny and Rafe are lucky enough to share.  Friends since childhood, they join the military together to become fighter pilots, find adventure and look after one another. Their relationship is strained by Rafe's decision to join the Eagle Squadron, a unit of the British Air Force filled with American volunteers.  Although upset, Danny tells him to be careful and promises to look after Rafe's newfound girlfriend Evelyn.  They soon discover that love and war are difficult bedfellows.If you skip the entertainment section of the newspaper, don't watch tv , never go to movies and live in a cave, it's possible that you haven't heard of this movie.  Maybe.  With a voluminous cast of name and no name actors, a budget bigger than most films gross, and lots of special effects, this film is going to draw huge crowds for the Memorial Day weekend.  I have no doubt of this.  What I'm curious to see is how the audiences will respond to it.
Once again the trailers are deceiving: while there are hints of the romantic nature of the movie, the focus is on the attack of Pearl Harbor and leads you to believe that it will examine the whys and wherefores behind the event.   The bulk of the screen time (and at three hours plus there's a whole lot of it) is devoted to the relationship between the three main characters.   I found it interesting that the marketing campaign in Japan meanwhile stressed this aspect over the action. Enough about the marketing you say, what about the film?Historians and battle aficionados take note - other movies on this subject have been more historically accurate and informational.  This movie is the Coles notes version of the events surrounding the infamous day in question. However, that means it will be more accessible to the casual moviegoer and no one will quibble about the superb special effects sequences (it is often difficult to discern what is a set and what is computer generated).  I was surprised that the battle sequences, originally intended to be as graphic as those in 'Saving Private Ryan', were considerably toned down.  They opted for hazy dream-like sequences at the hospital that proved to be more disorienting than disturbing.   The attack should have taken a more central role and been introduced sooner - there is little action for the first hour and a half - because younger viewers, and men (okay I'm generalizing here but it's true) will quickly lose interest.   Especially when they have to sit through mushy stuff.  : )While the romantic triangle is captivating (although things become a bit too complex at times - and no I won't give anything away here), the characters have little depth and the actors don't have much to work with.  Ben Affleck is his usual affable self, giving a far better performance that he did in his last romantic lead  (I've always liked him better than his cocky alter ego aka Matt Damon).   Kate Beckinsale (looking remarkably different that she did in 'Brokedown Palace') acquits herself adequately as the lovelorn lead, and Josh Hartnett, smolders as the fresh new kid  (to me at least - I haven't seen him in anything previously) and demonstrates a modicum of skill along the way.  Others aren't so lucky - Cuba Gooding Jr. barely qualifies as a supporting actor (things have been downhill since the Oscar), and Alec Baldwin has the misfortune to utter some of the worst lines ever written.
Ultimately, Pearl Harbor has the elements required to be a summer blockbuster: it's being released at the right time, it has impressive special effects and action sequences, the story is pretty straightforward and it is very American.  That doesn't mean that it's a good movie.  Don't expect too much and it will make for a decent matinee (albeit a long one).",7,1,1,24 May 2001
Man on the Moon," Go for Kaufman but stay for Carrey
","Man on the Moon: I never liked Andy Kaufman. My most vivid memory of Kaufman was the night he guest starred on 'Fridays', got into a screaming match and tried to pick a fight with one of the cast members (broadcast live).  There was also the whole wrestling schtick and Tony Clifton (the obnoxious untalented lounge singer).  Kaufman went out of his way to push peoples' buttons and lots of people couldn't wait to see what outrage he'd commit next.  I frankly couldn't have cared any less. While the film did not change my opinion of Andy Kaufman, it did reinforce my opinion of Jim Carrey's acting abilities. Carrey does not merely play Kaufman, he becomes him: from his physical appearance to his mannerisms.  Carrey displays a depth and energy that goes beyond anything he has done before. I was concerned that he might give an over-the-top performance then realized that given the subject matter that simply wasn't possible.  Carrey apparently became so enmeshed with the character that while on set his colleagues addressed him by the names of the different persona he portrayed.  If he is not nominated for Best Actor this time around (after having been snubbed for his work in 'Truman') I think the Academy will have a riot on their hands.",8,0,0,9 January 2000
The Transporter," The Transporter delivers!
","Frank Martin, provides the platinum standard among couriers: he will deliver any package, any where to any one, on time, no questions asked. Understandably,  his rates are a bit steeper than FedEx and his rules a bit more stringent. When he agrees to deliver a duffel bag Frank breaks Martin rule # 3  never look in  the package  only to discover that the contents are alive, kicking and beautiful.  What's a guy to do ?  Throw her back in the bag and complete the contract of course! Unfortunately Frank's employer is unhappy the indiscretion and his idea of a customer service complaint is to eliminate the server. The opening frantic car chase through the streets and along the boardwalks of Nice, sets the tone for the for the rest of the movie  infused with equal parts action and humor you quickly realize  that this is not a film that  takes itself seriously.  Co-written and produced by  Luc Besson (The Professional and The Fifth Element) it follows in the vein of his earlier films:  reluctant protagonist who bends the rules to do his job, shows a little humanity inadvertently becoming a champion for the oppressed, and having to dodge bullets, bombs and badmen along the way. .   The lead captures this spirit.Jason Statham's Frank is a no nonsense ex-special services minutia obsessed professional who refuses to be rattled even as the world is coming down around him (literally in one scene). Statham, best known as the fast talking Turkish in Snatch, possesses both the bulk and matter of fact glib finesse necessary to be an action hero.  The intricately choreographed and numerous marital arts sequences  - the best I've seen in a non Asian film  bear the trademarks of its Hong Kong predecessors and confirm that he also possesses the requisite physicality to carry a film in this genre. Statham may well turn out to be the next Bruce Willis (or at least his British counterpart.)There are several glaring problems with this film: the people smuggling subplot seems to have been an afterthought,  the dialogue is often unintentionally laughable, and then there are those pesky laws of physics  But none of that matters - I wanted high octane fun and pyrotechnics, and I wasn't disappointed..

City of God," Scarface goes to Rio.
","When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.  When life gives you nothing, you do what you can.  For the inhabitants of Cidade de Deus  (the City of God) one of the most notorious favelas (slums) outside of Rio de Janeiro that often means relying on crime to survive.  The inhabitants' problems are exacerbated by indiscriminate gun battles waged by gangs trying to control the drug trade, and cops whose interrogation techniques consist of shooting first and beating confessions out of the survivors.The City of God is a pseudo-documentary  based on real individuals and events that dominated the affairs of the slum in question for a period of two decades.  The cast of characters includes Rocket, the kid who hopes to use his camera to  escape the slums, Bene, the gentleman gangster and diplomat, Knockout Ned, one of the `good guys' who gets caught up in the maelstrom of madness, and Li'l Ze the sociopathic crime lord who's always ready to dole out death.   The performances in the film are top notch, especially when you realize that most of the participants aren't actors, consequently  the emotions on display are raw, edgy and  true to life. While several scenes initially appear overblown you quickly realize that the seemingly senseless violence is such that to play it any other way would be disingenuous. The gritty texture, harsh lighting and occasional jerky camera sequences enhance the film's documentary feel, rather than appearing gimmicky (unlike the host of cinema verite flicks of the past few years) The director also makes use of Pulp Fiction style folding time lines, and snappy editing to ensure  that the pacing doesn't stagnate, and is careful not to leave any loose ends. City of God treats the viewer to a brutal firsthand view of the poverty/crime cycle that thrives in the worlds slums.  Its in-your-face approach and disturbing ending begs the disturbing question, what happens if this destructive juggernaut ever organizes and decides to leave the confines of the ghetto?",Null,0,2,2 February 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Not your brother's martial arts film
","Anyone raised on a diet of martial arts films starring Steven Seagal, or Jean-Claude Van Damme is used to revenge based plots, sprinkled with banal action sequences and appalling acting.  Jackie Chan helped to change the Western view of martial arts films, infusing them with humor and acrobatic fight sequences.  Few people outside China however have seen a traditional Chinese martial arts film in which fealty, moral dilemmas and spiritual purity are as important to the plot as the fighting.  Ang Lee decided that it was time to rectify this oversight. Li Mu Bai, a legendary warrior monk, has grown weary of fighting and desires a normal life.  To that end he entrusts his sister-in-law, Yu Shu Lien with the task of delivering 'Green Destiny' - a sword on par with Excalibur - to an old family friend.  The sword is immediately stolen, leading Li and Yu on a quest where they will confront old enemies, struggle with loyalties and possibly experience love. I will start with several caveats about this film. Although the main actors (Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) have recently starred in Hollywood films, this movie is Chinese, which means subtitles for anyone who hasn't brushed up on their Mandarin.  Some people may be put off by the fantastical elements of the story - characters fly after one another and perform feats equivalent to catching bullets with their teeth.  Finally, the plot can be somewhat difficult to follow at times.  Having dispensed with these minor unpleasantries, I can now focus on the positives.  The locations and scenery border on the mythical - from the lush bamboo forests, to the cloud enshrouded mountains to the stunning recreation of Peking in it's ancient glory - the viewer is treated to a spectacular visual kaleidoscope.  The intricate action sequences are second to none - exquisitely choreographed by the same man who gave  'The Matrix' its oomph - they include amazing feats of gymnastics, a diverse selection of weaponry and last as long as ten minutes.   Finally, the story, in stark contrast to its Hollywood cousins, has substance, multidimensional characters that aren't just fodder for the hero, and examines the possible foibles of misguided loyalties and rigid traditions. Ang Lee has crafted a striking film that will appeal to any viewer who appreciates fine cinema.P.S.  bringing the live tiger to the premiere was a great touch",8,0,0,24 September 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Jackson defeats the bane of the blockbuster
","Beware what you  wish for.  Words I'm sure Peter Jackson has reflected on many a time in the past two and a half years.  After finding a studio to back his dream to bring The Lord of The Rings to the screen, Jackson spent 18 months and a quarter billion dollars to create his vision. Lurking in the back of his mind must have been the realization that the failure of the first chapter would have meant the possible ruination of a studio and the knowledge that the remaining two chapters would sit in the can, never to see the light of day. Luckily for Jackson, The Fellowship of the Ring went on to earn over $800 million dollars and unanimous accolades from fans and critics alike.  Now all he has to do is repeat this success two more times.With the fellowship dissolved, things are indeed looking grim.   Frodo and Sam have set out for Mount Doom, and must rely on Gollum, the devolved, delusional, former owner of the ring, to guide them. Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli, meet new allies to their cause and rediscover lost friends, but the joyful  reunion is short-lived when they learn that Saruman has dispatched his minions to destroy the stronghold at Helm's Deep, the first assault in the all out battle for Middle Earth.Anyone expecting the contemplative, leisurely pacing of  `The Fellowship Of The Ring' with it's in-depth character development, and ethereal venues will be shocked -  action is the watchword for `The Two Towers'.  Jackson wastes no time with the obligatory drawn out flashbacks, opting to jump straight into the fray, and notches up the adrenaline quotient in the process.  The editing is quick, and deliberate, the settings dark and oppressive, and battles are many.Once again the cast turn in solid performances.  Just as Viggo Mortenson imbues Aragorn with a regal charisma that shines through his bedraggled appearance, Ian McKellen's reinforces Gandalf's evolution, commanding your attention whenever he is onscreen. I especially enjoyed Gimli's role as comic foil -  quick with his axe or a zippy zinger - he adds the only real humor to the proceedings.  Elijah Wood is the standout once again, demonstrating an  even a wider range of emotions and ability.  I must admit that I feel sorry for him - he has managed to do such an outstanding job as Frodo that he is going to be typecast for eternity (not that there are many roles for hobbits in other films.)  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Brad Dourif who exudes putrescence as the diabolically reptilian Grima Wormtongue - I kept waiting for his forked tongue to peek out when he was speaking. There are two additional new characters of note.I was unsure how Jackson et al. were going to flesh out Treebeard, the leader of the Ents -  I had no difficulty imagining how he should look while reading the book, but didn't know how they would bring him to the screen. I needn't have worried - the CGI work is smooth, natural and avoids being cartoonish (some of the other Ents do not fare as well). And then of course there is Gollum.Arguably the most important character in the novel - nothing could have transpired without him - it was essential that he be properly rendered (with regards to appearance that is).  Rather than talk to a ball on a stick (a favorite prop when dealing with CGI characters), Jackson had Andy Serkis, the actor who delivers Gollum's lines, wear a motion capture suit while he acted his scenes with Wood.  The digital wizards at Weta works then turned to custom designed software to create the final screen character.  The results are exceptional - Gollum's expressions, movements, and speech are fluid and realistic.  On to the action.While editing the initial footage that had been shot for the Helm's Deep sequence, Jackson decided that they did not impart the spectacle that he intended, so he gathered cast and crew together and went back to New Zealand to shoot additional footage.  His instincts proved right.  The final product - a combination of live footage and CGI (driven by MASSIVE, his special effects department's customized AI software, which allows the characters to `think' and `act' independently) blend seamlessly.  The entire sequence is superbly scored and further enhanced by the sound effects - a cacophony of thunderous chanting, metal on metal, and screams of agony and victory - plunging the audience into the midst of epic orgy of destruction. Phenomenal.I do have a few caveats however.I'll start with my pet peeve,  the 360 pan shot (where the camera spins around the characters).  Whether showcasing vistas or highlighting dramatic moments, this can be a highly effective technique - when used sparingly. But when it gets used at least a dozen times in the first twenty minutes of the film, I say enough already (I was starting to feel a tad queasy). `Two Towers' is definitely not a standalone film - those not familiar with the books (or even the first film), are bound to miss not so subtle references and risk being left out altogether in other scenes. This was evident from the several people, including the friend that I took to the screening, who kept turning to companions for explanations.  Also, the battles between Gollum's dual personalities (Slinker and Stinker as Sam Gamgee calls them) are too frequent - the intended dramatic moments become almost slapstick, diminishing their intended effect.  One of two `battles' would have sufficed. The Tolkien purists however are sure to cry the loudest.Jackson takes more substantial liberties with the source material than he did in his first outing.  And we're not just talking about incorporating appendix material here (the Aragon/Arwen debate) -  there are several fundamental changes.  While these do not detract from the story - indeed some actually enhance the story (it is after all a screen adaptation), it took me awhile to get used to them.  Stay out of any LOTR chat rooms for the next few months.Ultimately, Jackson has produced an apt `sequel' to the first film, which is engaging, enjoyable and exciting and he deserves to be lauded for his efforts.  But I'll bet even money that he gets stood up again come Oscar time.",Null,0,0,20 December 2002
Coyote Ugly," It wasn't as bad as I thought (of course it may just be the hormones talking)
","Coyote Ugly: Coyote Ugly: Rather than follow the classic script - marry your high school sweetheart, settle down in a house with a white picket fence, 2.5 kids and a dog named spot, Violet sets off  (against her father's wishes)  for New York to fulfill her dreams as a songwriter.  Our heroine soon discovers that life in the big city isn't easy, and getting noticed in the music business is even worse.  In order to make ends meet she gets a job as a bartender at a local bar. Let the games begin.I've always found it interesting that women (at least the ones I know) will go to a movie, no matter how bad it looks, as long as their favorite star (Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, etc) is in it.  I can't stand the thought of an actor I enjoy being in a lousy movie, and tend to avoid them like the plague.   But all that came to a crashing halt when I saw the trailer for 'Coyote Ugly' - I didn't think 'Hey, this is the movie based on the GQ article' or 'This looks like an interesting story'.  The only thought that came to mind was 'Wow!'  So much for my credibilityProducer Jerry Bruckheimer, known for such testosterone laden dramas as 'Con Air' and 'The Rock',  has dropped the guns and explosions in favor of bars and bombshells (the non-exploding kind) in this homage to 'Flashdance'. The first half-hour of the movie is like a trip to a strip bar with several notable exceptions: the girls look better, they keep their clothes (what little they happen to be wearing) on, they can actually dance, the crowd is mixed and everyone is having a great time.  Furthermore, you don't have to worry about a cover charge, choking on smoke, or paying $6 for a watered down beer.  Unfortunately, they choose to spoil the fun with a 'plot'- it seems that our little Violet has performance anxiety and gets involved with a cute do-gooder boytoy.  Will she triumph over her fears, become a success, and marry her Prince Charming?  Honest, it's not predictable (note: heavy sarcasm alert!). They should have spent more time in the bar and less time in reflection.  Story aside, there actually are some good performances.The casting call for the part of Violet involved hundreds of girls and I can say without fear of reprisal or recrimination that they found exactly what they were looking for in Piper Perabo - she is cute, dynamic and possessed of a wide-eyed innocence that is genuine.   Not only does she have to look adorable, but she had to take piano, guitar, and singing and dancing lessons for the role (doing quite well at each I might add).  It was also a pleasure to see Maria Bello once a again - she was the no-nonsense-tough-as-nails doctor on ER who quit to pursue other interests and whom I feared would join David Caruso at the 'Home for Abandoned Actors'.   If your script calls for a 'Gutsy Broad' she's your woman.  The one piece of casting that sticks out worse than sunflower in a field of tulips is Tyra Banks - her character retires from the bar to go to law school.  Please, the only way I'm going to buy that one is if I've had one too many drinks beforehand - I would try to diminish her successes in any way, she is a beautiful, successful, vibrant woman, but by her own admission, if you're looking for brains from her, you had best look elsewhere. In summary, if you are searching for a tightly written cohesive plot, beautiful cinematography, suspense, or deep characters, this is not the movie for you.  If however you want to watch the beautiful people have some fun and don't feel like thinking for awhile, this may make for an entertaining matinee.",6,1,2,4 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," Sit back, relax and put your brain on cruise control
","Mission Impossible II: When you're Ethan Hunt, superspy extraordinaire, nothing ruins your day quicker than a madman peddling a stolen killer virus that could spell global genocide.  But, then again, it's not that unusual either The main complaint about the first theatrical version of Mission Impossible was that the story was too convoluted and consequently most people couldn't follow what was going on.  Personally, I disliked the movie because of the weak characters, lack of tension, and the horribly choreographed action sequences were (the helicopter-in-the-Chunnel scene was the final straw for me). Not wanting to repeat the past, the producers mercilessly dumbed down the plot for this one.  Unfortunately, they did it a little too well: the story bogs down whenever the guns aren't blazing, the dialogue sounds like they pulled it from a dime-store novel, the love scenes are tepid, and the villain embodies apathy at best.  Thank god for John Woo!Woo achieved virtual demi-god status as a director of Hong Kong action films and it was only a matter of time before he was wooed (no pun intended) by Hollywood.  Although his first North American features - 'Broken Arrow' and 'Hard Target' - enjoyed only a modicum of success, the public took notice with the release of 'Face Off'.  MI 2 proves that he just keeps getting better. Anyone familiar with his work would instantly recognize the trademark Woosims in this film: fluttering doves, slow motion action sequences, beautifully choreographed bullet ballets, adrenaline pumping car chases and impossible stunts (amazingly Cruise did most of his own stuntwork, much to the chagrin of Woo and the studio).  Although several of the action sequences border on the ridiculous (how many bullets can you fire at a fleeing hero without hitting him?  A whole lot), yet they are fun to watch - the last ten minutes of the movie are worth the price of admission alone.

The Insider," The good, the bad, and the ugly
","Warning:  Possible spoilers aheadThe Insider: After being fired as the chief researcher for a major tobacco company, Jeffrey Wigand is forced to sign a confidentiality agreement.  In a twist of fate he comes in contact with Lowel Bergman - a producer with 60 Minutes - who asks for his help decipher some documents.  Circumstances and a moral barometer convince Wigand that he must divulge his secrets.  Only after baring his soul does Wigand truly learn how much he really has to lose. At two hours and forty minutes this is a long movie with some notable lulls (are there enough cell phone conversations going on?) that should have been left on the cutting room floor.  In addition, Michael Gambon was particularly ineffective as the villain in the piece - he is annoying and distracting rather than menacing.  So much for the bad. 
Wonderful cinematography and a good script are outdone only by the performances.:  Crowe does a remarkable job as Wigand (he gained almost 40 pounds for the role) alternating between paranoia and rapture and you realize that he never understood the scope of his decision.  Pacino hums with intensity as the man-of -his-word that coaxes the story out of Wigand, only to watch his promises destroyed.  Finally, Christopher Plummer's take on Mike Wallace as a paragon of journalistic integrity who caves to his corporate masters is anything but flattering, (hence Wallace's attempts to stop this film from being made).  It doesn't get much better than this.The showpiece of the film is the depth of the conspiracy and total arrogance displayed by the tobacco companies.  As Wallace notes, Wigand's information doesn't merely say that 'cigarettes are bad for you':  he paints them as  dealers designing and pushing the ultimate in addictive drugs, and god help anyone that gets in their way.   We are talking the ugliest of the ugly.If you're a smoker who is tired of warnings on cigarette packages maybe this will give you pause the next time you light up.  If you don't smoke, it will give you one more reason not to start.",Null,0,0,5 November 1999
"Girl, Interrupted"," One Fell over this Cuckoo's Nest.
","Girl, Interrupted:  Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) has the distinction of being the only student in her graduating class with no post secondary plans - unless of course you count her desire to be a writer.  Her middle-class-cocktail-party-throwing-parents are mortified with the shiftless abomination they've raised, and make no attempt to hide their contempt.  When Susanna tries to cure a headache by swallowing a bottle of aspirin chased with a bottle of Vodka, she is sent to think things over in a sanitarium.  While there she meets the requisite cast of miscreants, malcontents, and maladjusted mental patients found in every asylum (at least in film).Ryder is cast against type, stretching her talents to the limit in her portrayal as the dispossessed young woman whose bleak worldview is tempered only by her self-loathing.  It is a refreshing departure from her roles in such feel-good films as 'Heathers' and 'Reality Bites'.  All kidding aside, this character was tailor-made for Ryder (she has a personal understanding of the subject matter having checked herself into a clinic at age 20 to deal with her anxiety), who was single-handedly responsible for bringing this story to the screen.  That is what makes her soulless, drawn, portrayal so disappointing. She spends the bulk of the film wandering about wide-eyed, confused, and virtually devoid of any emotion.  The film is not a complete waste however.Once again Angelina Jolie manages to rise above the material she has to work with ('Playing God' notwithstanding).  As Lisa she is prone to wild mood swings whether drug induced or natural.  A talented manipulator, she gets what she wants, by whatever means necessary.  Though Lisa is crazy, she always manages to keep her dignity, and Jolie never lets her become a caricature.  My only complaint is Lisa's epiphany near the end of the film - it is too contrived (I blame that on the writers, not Jolie).Miss it.",7,0,0,15 January 2000
Toy Story 2," Who says sequels can't be great?
","Toy Story 2: When an evil toy collector kidnaps Woody, Buzz and the gang set out to rescue him.  But will they get to Woody in time, or will he be sold to a toy museum?  This movie is proof that not all sequels have to suck (Aliens notwithstanding).  Once again the creators have crafted a solid story line, with the addition of several well-rounded new characters (they're not just there to provide colorful scenery).   I particularly enjoyed the winking nods to blockbusters past (the Star Wars take was hilarious) and the numerous in-jokes for the adults in the audience.  As always it's fun to play spot the Disney product placement (I saw characters from Bugs Life, Aladdin and the early Pixar shorts among others).    But the best thing about the sequel is the animation.With Toy Story, Pixar took computer animation to a level that most people only dreamed of (rent Wargames or Tron to see what 'cutting-edge' used to look like).  Rather than rest on their laurels, the animators have gone a step further and deliver beautifully rendered landscapes, seamless action sequences, and even more realistic human characters.  Also, the amazing attention to detail - numbering the parts on the landing gear -makes you forget you are watching a cartoon (I kept expecting to see a gaffer's hand slip into view). This film leads me to believe that it will only be a matter of years before digital characters start replacing co-stars in live action films. If you're looking for a film the whole family can enjoy, this is it.  Just try to avoid the matinee, or the screaming will drown out half the filmAlso, make sure you stay until the end of the credits for the 'outtakes'.",8,0,1,19 February 2000
Detroit Rock City," Annoying characters and ludicrous sub-plots - miss it.
","Detroit Rock City: the trials and tribulations of 4 teens trying to get into a KISS concert in 1978.  The premise spoke to me on a personal level - when my brother was 14 years old he told my parents he was going to stay at a friend's place, when in reality he and four friends drove 6 hours to another city to catch KISS in concert.I went expecting a light story and some good laughs.  What I got were annoying characters ( if I had to hear Trip spout more stoner stupidity I was going to scream) and mind numbingly stupid subplots (can anyone actually suspend disbelief long enough to buy Edward Furlong drinking until he fills a pitcher with vomit, then dancing onstage in a male stripper contest then being picked up by Shannon Tweed, and getting paid for sex?).

A Beautiful Mind," A Beautiful Mind is a terrible thing to waste
","A Beautiful MindFew people ever cross paths with true genius.  My encounter happened while I lived in a university dormitory.  `Tom' was a gangly 17-year-old whose most distinguishing features were his penchant for missing classes, a photographic memory, and a flawless mastery of several different musical instruments.  I remember vividly the day he asked me to read a History paper that dealt with Sino/Indian relations in the Cold War era.  Written as Swiftian satire, it had taken him three hours to write and was one of the most insightful and brilliant things I've ever read. Although it was three months late, his professor said it was outstanding and gave Tom a first class grade.  However, as the axiom states, there is a fine line between genius and insanity   I soon learned that Tom was prone to fits of manic self-destruction and substance abuse.  The last I heard he was doing freelance work for Rolling Stone, had been published in several well-known literary magazines, was dabbling in heroin and was in heavy therapy. 
While studying at Princeton, John Nash sets himself a simple task - find an original idea that will revolutionize mathematics.  While such an undertaking reeks of hubris, it is a natural progression for John, a genius who dwells in a different world where everything, regardless of its apparent randomness is linked by theorems and patterns.  He is eventually recruited to work for the Department of Defense, where he becomes enmeshed in a shadowy netherworld of spies and conspiracies and loses touch with those around him. Warning:  Potential spoilers ahead!The fact that John Nash's findings shook the foundations of economic theory and earned him a Nobel Prize should be enough to impress anyone.  What makes his story truly remarkable is that he achieved what he did while struggling with paranoid schizophrenia.  The film's success ultimately rests on the lead's ability to capture Nash's tortuous journey.  Whoever cast Crowe deserves a hefty bonus.Several days before I went to the sneak preview for  this film, reviewers were already gushing over Crowe's performance, and naming him as the frontrunner in the Oscar race.  Never one to swallow the word of critics (I know, ironic), I reserved judgment and can now state that Crowe is, for lack of a better word, riveting. The harder Nash struggles to crack the cosmological code, the weaker his grip on reality becomes and Crowe captures this masterfully.  He skillfully balances Nash's quirky brilliance and pathos as he dances between reality and insanity.  Crowe pulls the viewer into this crumbling world, and avoids becoming the stereotypical slobbering `madman'.  Jennifer Connelly is lyrically beautiful as John's wife Alicia (does she ever age?).  While the beginnings of their relationship seem dubious, does love ever really make sense? Connelly leaves the viewer with no doubt that Alicia was Nash's only link to the real world, tacit as it was  without her, he would probably still be languishing in a medicated stupor in some asylum.  Connelly gives Alicia a soul, wringing everything she can from her lines and I feel that it was a disservice to both Connelly and her character that she was not given more substantive dialogue.  Ed Harris and Paul Bettany also turn in excellent performances.  While the acting and direction in the film is exceptional, more attention should have been paid to the editing and pacing  several sections lag unnecessarily, notably the extended scenes that dwell on Nash's madness. They could have been cut down without lessening the impact.  In addition, Crowe's accent, which is hard to peg, slips a few times (okay, I'm being picky, but I really notice that).  The biggest `problem' is the marketing: the trailers are deceiving, leading you to believe that the film is a cloak and dagger thriller when it is so much more. A Beautiful Mind is one of those rare films that will appeal to both casual moviegoers and cinema fans alike.",8,0,2,3 January 2002
The Green Mile," Just when you've lost faith in Hollywood, this comes along
","The Green Mile: Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is in charge of death row at Louisiana's Cold Mountain Penitentiary in the 1930's.  Despite the nature of the job, he takes great pains to make life comfortable for the inmates he must eventually shepherd to the Grim Reaper.   Edgecomb's life is changed forever when he meets John Coffey (Michael Duncan), a gentle giant with a unique gift who may have been wrongly convicted. Unlike 'Eyes Wide Shut' and some other super hyped movies this year, the promotion machine for Mile has been running on idle - unless you're a movie fan or you read the book you probably haven't even heard of it until this past week.  Brought to the screen by the duo responsible for Shawshank Redemption (author Stephen King and director Frank Darabont) I expected nothing less than excellence.  I was not disappointed. 
On it's most basic level, The Green Mile could be described as a study of good vs evil or a debate over the pros / cons of capital punishment but such a simple analysis does the film a disservice. A tightly written story it interweaves humor, horror, mystery, mysticism, and drama.  At three hours long however, it might not appeal to the casual moviegoer.
The casting is superb and the actors mesh well, an important consideration given the set's confined spaces (according to Hanks, the area they had to work in was no larger than 100 square feet).  I would love to discuss the performances of the entire cast- Hanks, Barry Pepper, Michael Jeter, etc - but two actors in particular stand out: Duncan whose combined physical presence and surprising acting skills make Coffey believable (rumor has it that at one point Shaquille O'Neal was considered for the role - all I can say is thank heaven for small miracles) and Doug Hutchinson as Percy the sadistic prison guard - arguably the most evil character since Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.   Without these two actors, the film simply would not have gelled as well as is does. If the recent deluge of cinematic drivel has left you feeling that Hollywood has forgotten the art of film making, this movie will change your mind.",8,0,0,5 December 1999
The Iron Giant," Great animation and storyline make for a wonderful film
","Iron Giant - boy befriends giant robot from space -  Part ET, part Ghandi, with a dash of Bambi.Whenever I hear a lot of positive reviews about a movie I am instantly suspicious.  I went expecting to see an all right Disney wannabe and was pleasantly surprised. The animation is excellent - a fusion of  American Pop and  Heavy Metal - and helps recreate the atmosphere of 50's (I especially enjoyed the 'Duck and Cover' film they were watching at school). 
The story is thoroughly engaging for both kids and adults (however I recommend you may want to miss the early screenings - I lost a good 5 minutes of dialogue to screaming children). Best of all, it's nice to see an animated film without distracting musical numbers (don't get me wrong, I like musicals as well as the next guy) because done wrong they will handicap a movie (Prince of Egypt comes to mind.  Also, I think it considerable courage to take an anti-violence stance and say something as radical as 'Guns kill people' (the NRA won't be endorsing this film any time soon). This movie did not fail to deliver on any level and I will be seeing it again.Michael Eisner may want to cash in a few more of his options while they're still worth something, because if this is a preview of things to come from WB, there is a definite contender for the Disney crown.",7,1,2,7 August 1999
Any Given Sunday," Some fine performances, but it's too long to keep you involved
","Any Given Sunday: Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), the coach of the Miami Sharks (a once great football team) is a hard drinking, no nonsense legend, used to making deals on a handshake.  D'Amato believes in only one thing - the purity of the game - which makes him as an anachronism in a world filled with showboating free-agents interested in nothing but self promotion and portfolio building.  After losing his star quarterback to an injury D'Amato calls on Willie Beaman - an unproven third stringer, to break the team's slump, and is surprised when the new boy actually delivers.  Faster than you can snap a football, Beaman is transformed - breaks up with his girlfriend of several years, starts making commercials, ditches the playbook, and begins aggravating his teammates.  Add a cantankerous female owner, who wants to win at all costs, and you have one very stressed out coach.There seems to a belief among directors that in order for their films to be considered 'serious cinema' they must be at least two and a half hours long (we can thank/blame Oliver Stone for this).   When they deliver the goods, you don't even notice the length.  When they fail, time can't go fast enough.  Sunday falls square in the no-man's land between the two.Stone's initial thesis - football as a symbol of the decline of a bygone age based on honor and reliance upon one's fellow man - is compelling and strong enough to carry a film.  Unfortunately, even with three hours to tell his story, Stone can't decide what he wants to say.  Instead he chooses to veer off on multiple tangents, and devotes valuable time trying to build up several irrelevant subplots that contribute nothing and ultimately hamstring his efforts.  Thankfully there are some good performances.Whether mob kingpin, or the devil himself, Pacino giving it his all is the closest you will get to a sure thing in Hollywood.  D'Amato's life-as-sport philosophizing is balanced by his frequent tirades, and withdrawn agony.  In the hands of an inexperienced actor D'Amato would have been little more than a caricature, but Pacino treads carefully and takes pains not to overshadow his colleagues. Jamie Foxx does an admirable job in his first serious outing, as does LL Cool J (just forget about 'In Too Deep' and you'll be fine).  Dennis Quaid is believable as the injured superstar - he grimaces so well that you will feel his pain.  The weak link in this film is Cameron Diaz, who tries too hard to be a tough guy - it requires more than being able to shriek and curse people out.",6,0,0,28 December 1999
The Emperor's New Groove," Hands down, the best family movie this year!
","The Emperor's New Groove: Disney (not counting their Touchstone division) produces two kinds of movies: live family oriented films like '102 Dalmations' (although the quality is generally better) and animated musicals a la 'Tarzan' or 'Aladdin'.  Their most recent offering, though patterned on the latter, lacks the trademark songs and forays into morality, opting instead for an old fashioned cartoon.  A gutsy move indeed.Kuzco is a self centered spoiled brat, but when you're the 18 year old ruler of a South American country, that's not a stretch.  When Kuzco fires Yzma, his 'trusted' advisor and her behemoth helper Kronk, they decide to do away with him.  Although they bungle the attempt on his life, they do succeed in turning him into a Llama.  More troubling than being turned into a beast of burden is Kuzco's knowledge that he is at the mercy of the very peasant whose land he was about to appropriate for a summer home.  Who ever said life is easy?One of the qualities that I enjoyed most about 'Iron Giant' was that the characters didn't keep breaking out into song - it's not that I don't enjoy musicals, but they can grow tiresome.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie mainly because I knew they had changed the content several times, probably fearing a repeat of 'Road to El Dorado's' bad box office. Radically altering the course of a film midstream generally leads to problems (does anyone remember 'Supernova'?), and at the very least, I doubt Sting will ever offer to score another Disney film after they scrapped the bulk of his songs.  Fortunately this break with the Disney convention works.
Although I'm not a huge David Spade fan, the combination of his skewed sarcastic humor and excellent animation is exactly what the emperor-turned- Llama calls for, making Kuzco a character we like, in spite of the fact that he is a shameless cad.  On the other end of the spectrum is Pacha, voiced by Jon Goodman, the kind and caring peasant who is willing to help Kuzco although it may be to his detriment.  Yzma, Kuzco's scheming right hand woman, is brought to life by Eartha Kitt's raspy voice and spot on animation (before you even hear her voice you know who the 'actor' is), and is positively scary, but in a nice way.  Finally,  Kronk (Puddy from 'Seinfeld' who incidentally will be starring in a live-action version of 'The Tick' on FOX) the sidekick wanna-be, is hilarious as the double-digit-IQ-walking-slab-of-muscle more concerned with cooking than killing.The combination of the sixties style animation, solid characters and slapstick style result in a movie that is pure, simple and unmitigated fun.

The Sixth Sense," A subdued thriller with a pleasant surprise
","Sixth Sense: What if you could interact with ghosts? This is the 'gift' that 8-year-old Cole (Haley Joel Osmont) must deal with every waking moment, never knowing what disfigured spectre will cross his path next.  His teachers think he's dysfunctional, his classmates call him a freak and his mother doesn't know what to make of him.   Enter Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), eminent child psychologist (Bruce Willis) who sees Cole as a chance to redeem himself for perceived past failures.   First let me state that the advertising for this movie is somewhat misleading as this isn't a horror movie in the classic sense.  Given the premise it may sound strange to say that, but the bulk of the movie is spent trying to make us understand Cole's situation rather than trying to scare us every thirty seconds.  That said, there are some very good scares.Osmont does an excellent job as the troubled Cole, showing maturity beyond his years -  he conveys the terror of his situation without being melodramatic (if only he'd been available for Phantom MenaceÂ…).  Expect to see a lot more of him in the future.  It was also nice to see Willis given a chance to display his acting talents for a change, rather than just blowing things up (not that I don't enjoy that as well).  Maybe this will finally give Willis some well deserved credibility and more challenging  roles in the future.Finally, although this movie does not exactly keep up a blistering pace, it had one of the best surprises I've seen since 'No Way Out'.Enjoy.",9,0,0,2 August 1999

Sitting in the waiting area, they watch in horror as the plane bursts into flames and crashes into the sea.   Though scared and confused, they are thankful for being spared.  But fate isn't ready to give up so easily.Although Destination is another body-count movie it is a nice change of pace from such tiresome slasher flicks as 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' or 'Urban Legend'.  Rather than an unhinged serial killer driven by a minor slight, the pursuer here is Death itself.  I was glad to see that the producers didn't rely on CGI effects for a grim hooded specter.  Instead, Death is a quiet and subtle foe announced only by a wisp of wind, a brief shadow, or an unnerving hum- which makes for an unsettling effect. 
The dialogue is definitely lacking (but I didn't go in expecting Hamlet) and several of the characters do nothing but whine - their deaths couldn't come soon enough for me. There is however a palpable tension which will keep you engaged, and deliver a few jumps.  Make it a matinee.",6,0,0,19 March 2000
The Matrix," Best fresh action/plot combination since Face Off
","After all the trailers, interviews, and general hype, I stood in line, special preview pass in hand, ready for the action film of the season. Subconsciously, the question Can they deliver or will TM join Johnny Mnemonic on the Keanu scrap heap dogged me as the lights went out.The first twenty minutes of the film seemed to confirm the worst:  it was choppy, cryptic and I found my mind wandering.  Luckily the pace picked up and never slowed down again. As Neo, Reeves gives a fairly wooden performance (something we've come to expect of him), but surprisingly it actually helps his character.  Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is wonderful: alluring and deadly, a leather clad black widow.  Fishburne's softspoken, almost monastic Mephisto is riveting.  And, finally, there is Joe Pantoliano's Cypher, as devious and slimy as we've come to expect him (Bound, Risky Business,etc).The nightmarish real earth landscape was truly hellish.  The setting and atmosphere will obviously be compared with T2, Blade Runner, and Dark City, not to mention shades of Demolition Man, and Brazil.  Thankfully TM does  an excellent job of this and will not be seen as merely a copycat.  I was also thankful of the fact that TM does not follow the simple linear plot line common in most Hollywood films these days and makes you pay attention and, god forbid, think.  Setting and plot aside, the question on many people's mind, is does the action live up to the hype.   Yes.The action sequences were simply breathtaking and beautifully choreographed, worthy of John Woo .  On these merits alone I would strongly recommend the movie.  The fact that the actors did all their own stunts and spent several months in intensive martial arts training only gives it that much more oomph.   Combine this with the effective utilization of the new freeze photography (popping up in everything from the Gap commercials to Wing Commander),  and you have some of the best scenes ever filmed.This movie will be a welcome addition to my film collection when it hits the video stores next year (hopefully I'll have my DVD player by then so I can enjoy it even more).",8,0,0,1 April 1999
The Replacements," The best football movie of the summer...
","The Replacements: Professional football takes a turn for the bizarre when the players go out on strike - rather than suspend the season, the owner of the Washington Sentinels asks his coach to cobble together a team of replacement players to carry on.Football on the big screen has been approached from almost every conceivable angle: humorous ('The Longest Yard'), love story ('All the Right Moves'), sport as metaphor for life ('Any Given Sunday') and pathos ('North Dallas Forty') are but a few examples.   Essentially a composite of all the above, 'The Replacements', is loosely based on facts - the fictional Sentinels represent the Washington Redskins whose replacement players did quite well - the NFL however would not allow the film to use the name of any real teams).If I remember correctly, (keep in mind that I'm not a sports fan and it was a long time ago) the NFL strike of 1987 was due to player dissatisfaction with the salary cap and the subject of free agents.   The utter ludicrousness of multimillionaire sports figures pleading poverty is summed up in an interview with the striking quarterback for the Sentinels who says 'Well $5 million might sound like a lot of money, but I have to give 10% to my agent.' Just then a colleague pipes up 'And do you know how much it costs to ensure a Ferrari?!?'   The frightening thing is that some players actually believe this stuff.Reeves, not known for his dramatic flair, is believable as Shane Falco (it is after all Reeves' third outing as a gridiron grappler), a forgotten quarterback who blew a promising career with one bad game .   Brook Langton, Reeves' love interest, is gutsy, subdued, and cute, but not obnoxiously so and. reminded me of a young Lauren Holly (before she became bitter.).  The supporting cast does an excellent job, but I particularly enjoyed the casting of John Madden and Pat Summerall whose officiating lends an air of realism to the proceedings.I do however have two misgivings about the movie: the trailer I saw this evening gives away some of the best parts of the movie (a trend that I've noticed is getting worse) and what is the preoccupation with football players vomiting (it played a role in 'Any Given Sunday')- I don't find it particularly amusing.That said, , 'The  Replacements' is uncomplicated, funny, and takes a few well aimed shots at professional sports.  I recommend it to anyone in search of some light entertainment - just don't pay full price.",7,9,12,9 August 2000
Gladiator," A entertaining movie that will be displaced in weeks.
","Gladiator:  Having defeated the last pocket of resistance to the Roman Empire General Maximus is determined to return to his life as a farmer. Marcus Aurelius Caesar has other plans;  he wants Maximus to succeed him as ruler so that Rome can once again become a republic and be returned to the people.  Unfortunately, Aurelius' son Commodus learns of this and sentences Maximus to death. But, the best laid plansThis movie seems to have triggered a round of 'Blockbusteritis'- after a spate of mediocre films, it is the first big budget movie of the summer and it is indeed entertaining.  But the 62nd best movie of all time (as voted by 3500 members on the Internet Movie Database)?  I think not. 
The first battle scene is without a doubt my favorite part of the film - an amazing spectacle enhanced by excellent cinematography and painstakingly choreographed, it combines the best elements of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Braveheart'.  I was in addition duly impressed by the special effects, particularly the recreation of the Coliseum, and the battles between the gladiators (it may be a bit too intense for some people, after all it's not often that you get to see a literal bloodbath).  I did however have several problems with the story. Maximus rides from Germania to Spain, a journey that would surely take weeks if not months and arrives literally moments too late to save his family - a little too convenient for my liking.  Also, after all that time his wound is still bleeding - surely he would have become food for the buzzards long before that.  Or why did Commodus not have Maximus assassinated when he returns to Rome?  But my biggest question was the past between Maximus and Lucilla: without a doubt, the most pivotal relationship in the movie and it is never explained.  The acting is similarly unbalanced.Once again Russel Crowe proves his versatility as an actor: his Maximus is quiet spoken, stoic, straightforward and lives by a code of honor (a concept too few people are familiar with these days).  It is impossible not to feel for him.  Richard Harris, though onscreen only briefly, is excellent as the omnipotent ruler who knows his time is ending (I hope it was the makeup that made him look that bad) and is determined to do the right thing.  I'm still ambivalent over Joaquin Phoenix's take on Commodus, the villain of the piece - I did not hate him for being evil, but for annoying me.  I couldn't wait for someone to cleave him in two to put an end to the whining, sniveling, incestuous little weasel.Although Gladiator does not have the staying power of Spartacus or Ben Hur, it is a good way to wile away an afternoon.",8,0,0,15 May 2000
Rock Star," Rock N' Roll with a side order of excess
","Where have all the rock stars gone?  The bubble gum pop bands with their virginal image and the hip hopping wannabe baddies bore me.  Where's the flash and excess of groups like Led Zeppelin, or the old Motley Crue?  These were the hard rocking, and even harder partying bands who brought the sex and drugs to rock n' roll.  Whether trashing hotel rooms, engaging in debauchery that would make Caligula blush, or caught up in a deluge of chemicals and booze, there were no half measures.  Women wanted them and men wanted to be them.  Sometimes, life is good.Life as a photocopier repairperson is less than riveting.  For Chris Cole the only way to cope with the daily tedium of toner and paper jams is in his alternate guise as the lead singer in a 'Steel Dragon' tribute band.  Chris acts, dresses and sounds like his idol, hoping beyond all reason that one day he will join his idols.  Lucky for him, rock and roll is a fickle business. As anyone who follows heavy metal (or reads previews) knows, 'Rock Star' is loosely based on the true story of salesman-turned-heavy-metal-frontman Tim 'Ripper' Owens, who was tapped to fill in as lead singer for Judas Priest when Rob Halford left the band.  However, the similarities end there - when Judas Priest pressed for increased creative control over the project, the producers opted to distance themselves from the band and change the story and the exploits of  'Steel Dragon' are a composite of several apocryphal rock legends.  With strong performances in such films as 'Three Kings' and 'The Perfect Storm' Mark Wahlberg has proven that he is more than a living underwear mannequin.     Wahlberg brings the same combination of innocence and wide-eyed wonderment to Chris that he displayed in 'Boogie Nights' (without displaying much else).  These qualities keep Chris' transformation from nobody to rock god from becoming a ridiculous parody. Keeping him grounded is Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend/manager, the one person who realizes his talents and for once Aniston breaks free of Rachel, and delivers a decent performance.  The supporting cast, drawn from real rockers and solid character actors, gel well onscreen. Overall, the story is well paced, light-hearted, the soundtrack is great  (I felt my head moving back and forth more than once) and you actually buy the group as a real band.  Definitely worth the price of admission, and remember not to leave before the outtakes are finished.",Null,27,40,7 September 2001
High Fidelity," One of Cusack's top five performances.
","High Fidelity: Rob Gordon is the owner of an alternative record store, who along with his two co-workers, spends his time making up top-five lists and generally coasting through life.  As he sifts through the debris of another relationship that has crashed and burned, he slips into a deep blue funk. Unable to figure why he keeps failing at love he decides to contact the women involved in his worst break-ups and ask them to answer his question 'What is wrong with me?'   Of course, he may not be ready for the answer.John Cusack has proven himself as a versatile actor in a variety of roles ranging from 'Say Anything' to 'Being John Malkovich'.  Funny, intense, quirky, and generally likeable he appeals to many viewers, and this role is no exception.  Rob is a composite of many guys I have known (including me) and rings true: the quintessential confused post-breakup male who is not yet cynical enough to abandon all hope of finding the perfect person, but ego-bruised enough to try and 'fix himself'.  Whenever the soliloquies or subject matter are getting too heavy, Jack Black steps in as the comic relief pinch-hitter.To say that Barry  -one of the eclectic employees at Championship Vinyl - is frantic is a gross understatement.  He could be the poster child for Ritalin.  Pompous, unrelenting, and possessed of a mean streak a mile wide, he is also hilarious and there is never a dull moment when he is on screen (luckily for Cusack it is not that often).  One of the best 'relationship' movies I've seen in a long time.",7,0,1,2 April 2000
