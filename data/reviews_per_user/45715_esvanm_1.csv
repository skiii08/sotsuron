","This was one of the unique movies i have ever seen. I'm use to the Bruce Willis movies where Bruce kills 100 bad guys and goes into the sun and is the greatest police officer the world has ever seen. This movie should me the things that actually went on during the war, it's one thing to read about them in the newspaper or book, or hear them from somebody, but to actually witness the things they did to these people. It was inhumane i don't know how anyone could do these things to a animal yet along a human being, it's disgusting. This movie made me feel so lucky that i wasn't born in the time it took place. I don't know what i would have done if i was the kid in the movie, everything he did was the right thing, if he would have changed anything he probably wouldn't be alive at the end of the movie, but after everything that is happen to him i don't think he is alive anymore. The worst part of the movie that made me extremely sad was when they gather all the people in the village and put them in the barn and then light them on fire. I know it was a movie but as i was watching it i had to think to myself this actually has happened and is happening some where right now and there's nothing we can do. They didn't even let the kids live, they were true animals",8,1,1,5 June 2012
