Angels & Demons," Save Your Time, Energy and Money
","'Angels and Demons' is simply a dreadful movie. You would be better off staying home to sort your socks or wash your underwear. If you desire entertainment and enjoyment from a recreation of the spiritual, rent 'Ghostbusters.' sit back, relax and enjoy a group of people making a film about angels and demons who know how to make a film about the topic.'Angels and Demons' drags on forever. The writing is indescribably bad. The acting is reminiscent of young children acting out a space movie in their parents basement using ironing boards, toy soldiers, crayons, packs of matches for explosives and graduation gowns for the get-ups word by cardinals, priests and other members of the cloth. Even the special effects are largely lame. 'Independence Day' and 'Men In Black' are so much better effected and so much more interesting and fun. Really, honestly, avoid this film. Take up a new hobby. Or take a nap. How I wish I had gone into my 'Seinfeld' collection for some laughs rather than going to a theater to be tortured by such pap.",2,24,61,15 May 2009
Sleepy Hollow," SLEEPY RESULTS
","SLEEPY HOLLOW is a drag.  Tired. Stilted.  Jaded. Doesn't Tim Burton ever tire of this form with its freakish images and ghoulish designs?  The script is wooden; the performances even more so.  Save your money. Or better yet, donate to the poor.",4,1,3,4 December 1999
American Beauty," AMERICAN BEAUTY; AMERICAN CLASSIC
","This may be the best film of 1999.  An inventive script, really creative directing, and acting that is just superb  make this an American classic. Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning deserve Academy Award nominations. Thora Birch becomes a woman. Sam Mendes also warrants consideration for his artful directing. Every element of this film is perfectly measured and portioned. The comedy and the tragedy work well together.  WAR OF THE ROSES meets FARGO somewhere in middle America.  Stunning. Provocative.  Lustful. Powerful.  A must see for film folks.",10,0,0,21 September 1999
Being John Malkovich," WOW!
","This film is as much fun as one can have in a theatre without getting arrested.  Clever. Sarcastic.  Bold. BJM is loaded with twists and turns that are commonplace in  student films but are pulled off here with professionalism, irony and grace.  Worth the price of admission and several screenings more.",10,0,1,27 November 1999
No Country for Old Men," New Coen Masterwork
",'No Country For Old Men' is so much more than I expected. I did not anticipate its intensity and kept waiting for the Coen Comic Cosmos to take over the screen. That does not happen. What happens is some of the most masterful story telling you will ever see. The casting is marvelous. The cinematography is superb. The editing is so flawless and powerful that even someone who has never edited film or video before will recognize not only its impact but its beauty when it is done so well.This is a nasty and beautiful film. No music. Just real sound. Real impact. Reel impact. It is not for those made uncomfortable by violence. Stick with 'Desperate Housewives' if you are of that feint inclination. This film inflicts pain into the lives of those it depicts and those who partake. It is 24 hours later and I still ache.,10,1,8,25 November 2007
Any Given Sunday," HARD HITTING/FAST ACTION/EXPLOSIVE SOUND
","Oliver Stone has taken another turn in his interesting career with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  The film explodes on the screen,  and proceeds with mortars and grenades throughout. The action is fast.  The sound is monstrous.  The acting is as big as the characters require. Pacino fills the screen, but don't look too far past Lawrence Taylor and LL Cool J and others for some fine performances.  This is a football fan's movie.  It is also a film lover's movie. And if you like Oliver Stone, you'll enjoy his latest effort at filling the screen.",7,0,0,16 December 1999
