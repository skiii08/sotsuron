Alien 3," The new face of horror
","What an excellent movie! David Fincher brings us undoubtedly the darkest of the alien installments. The plot is simple, but not too simple. The direction is extremely solid as are the performances by all actors including supporting ones. In my opinion, this film brought a new hope to horror films, as it brings much needed emotion deepness combined with a great suspense factor. The new alien design deviates slightly from the previous ones but turns out to be excellent on the main action scene, even if hampered a bit by primitive CG graphics. The work by amalgamated dynamics on the special effects however is brilliant showing us the most realistic live action alien yet. The score composed by Elliot Goldenthal is brilliant, quite similar to his work in 'Interview with the vampire'. See this movie, you wont regret it.",8,1,3,28 March 2001
Fight Club," Behold the greatest film ever
","This is not a movie. It is an experience. When I first heard of it I just imagined it would be just another action packed brain less flick, until I realized the director was David Fincher. That was the reason I saw it. As I saw the movie I felt something that I had never felt when watching a movie: I felt that it could be a critic to my own life. The film is a critic to today's emotion less society, where all is single serving and where vacuum cleaners are worth more than human lives. Some may say that it may influence negatively people, in my opinion its a wake up call, a serious one. I wont comment on the excellent performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, on the flawless direction by Fincher and on the extraordinary script, I will just say: WATCH THIS MOVIE because you might be asleep and don't even know it. On a more technical note, I think this movie proves that visual effects have a space on movies not as fireworks but as narrative tools, you will know what I mean when you watch it.",10,0,1,28 March 2001
Alien: Resurrection," Resurrection ma non tropo
","There are some grave injustices in this world. We are in front of one of them. This movie is EXCELLENT! It completely brought back to life a saga that was buried by another brilliant and not understood movie: alien 3. But the critics didn't let it. The issues of humanity, new way of facing the alien, new Ripley, dark environments, interesting characters and excellent direction make this film a near masterpiece of sci-fi, horror and action. The fresh direction from a french director that also brought us 'The City of Lost Children' gives us a completely different movie that deviates from the normal pace of the alien movies. The only problem I can see in this movie is that the change is so big that the movie spends its entire time acomodating people to the changes, and doesn't face completely its issues, but that for me isn't a problem: on the contrary of what critics are saying, this opens the door for a grandeous Alien 5 in the future that could truly end the saga as it deserves. Two thumbs up for its excepcional musical score that brings back elements from the other three movies, and an applause for its great special and visual effects, bringing for the first time realistic CG aliens to life.",7,1,1,2 April 2001
Alien," What sci-fi should be like
","This movie is probably one the greatest sci-fi milestones ever made. The plot seems very simple, and indeed it is. But this is not in anyway a plot driven movie. What makes this movie great are its environments brought to life by a flawless and genius direction by Ridley Scott. The characters, all built by strong performances, specially by Tom Skerrit, Sigourney Weaver, Ian Holm and John Hurt, seem completely convincing as 22nd century people crewing the 'Nostromo', a titanic starship. When the appearance of the alien comes, the designs made by H.R. Giger are quite notable, making the creature itself also a milestone in horror and sci-fi. The only problem I can see in the movie is the fast pace of the end sequence that leaves behind the questions about the nature of the creature itself, that as a scene shows, is a reflection on a broken mirror of humanity itself. That doesn't stop it from being a great movie.",7,1,1,30 March 2001
Aliens," A miracle
","Yes, indeed a miracle. This is one of the few movies that follows up and changes the formula of an excellent film and doesn't loose anything at all in quality, relative to its genre. In a very clever way, this movie transports the universe from the sci-fi epic 'alien' into an action movie that is probably the best of its type. James Cameron shows great talent while directing this film, always keeping connections to the Ridley Scott's 'Alien' so that the idea of sequel isn't broken despite the great difference between the films. The acting is good, and excellent in the case of Sigourney Weaver (however, how polemic this may sound, I think she's even better in Alien 3). The plot is very simple like in the first movie, but as the few twists come it becomes quite convencing. The special effects are quite good for its time showing a clear improvement from the first movie. The alien queen is quite impressing. The action sequences are memorable and have inspired many 'imitations' in other movies and even in some video games. This film only receives a worst score than the first because if we put aside the different genres, the movie itself is quite worst than the first, it is in the action genre that it is great.",6,2,5,2 April 2001
