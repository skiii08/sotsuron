Mission: Impossible III," An impressive, exciting start to the summer movie season!
","I was constantly and utterly entertained by this movie. From beginning to end, Tom Cruise and company gave intense performances while allowing the special effects, high octane explosions, and super cool spy technology to serve as characters themselves. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was an excellent villain who left me wanting more. Billy Crudup was great as were the rest of the supporting cast including Keri Russell, Ving Rhames, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. The script was sharp and never deviated from the the action. If the rest of the summer blockbusters live up to the quality of this show, it will be one of the best movie summers I can remember for awhile.",8,2,4,6 May 2006
