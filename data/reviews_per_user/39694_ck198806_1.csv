The Hangover," Def Hilarious
","This movie was great! I will add that I'm a 21 year old college female, if that validates my review a little more. I saw this with my boyfriend, completely sober, and I loved it. It had me laughing from beginning to end...more than most comedies ever make me laugh. I don't think it's just a frat boy comedy because it has much better jokes...it's not just beer, breasts and sex everywhere. The story has a great plot line, and the set up is awesome. I usually try to find plot holes in movies and I couldn't find anything obvious in this one. Mr. Chow is hilarious, I'm Asian, and he was so stereotypically awful that I couldn't help but laugh, especially cause I would only see him naked even though he shows up in clothes later. There were some parts that actually had me frustrated and nervous when the fat guy was counting cards (I'm terrible at remember names in movies ha). All in all...it was worth a midnight movie...if you've got a sense of humor and a little bit of an alcoholic in you, you can totally relate :)",8,3,6,6 June 2009
