The Longest Yard," happy (not) dolly Madison owes me $5.50 for the ticket not including my time i wasted seeing this title!
","The longest yard comes up a little over two feet short. I think Burt must have been very hard up to even consider the script. Hopefully the screenwriter of this title graduates from junior high so he can get into high school in the fall. If he studies hard maybe in about 80 years he will be able to write another script that will be worthy of production....this one wasn't. Don't get me wrong....there are a lot of people laughing all the way to the bank. This is why the Hollywood click makes films. This one was an exercise to demonstrate why sequels JUST DON'T WORK most of the time. The only redeeming value in the title is a short blip of a beautiful New Mexico sunset from the 'old main' out over the Bonanza Creek Movie Ranch just south of Santa Fe.If you like juvenile bathroom humor, grossly loud sound track and a six ounce bag of popcorn for $4.25.....I heartily recommend that you all flock to the big screen before this grosser hits the little screen to bore us for another 86 minutes. And Yes before they insert about 45 minutes of commercials.",1,6,13,5 June 2005
