Source Code," Interesting concept, lukewarm result
","While I thought the concept of those lingering 8 minutes before your mind dies was very interesting (just like persistence of vision which allows us to enjoy film in the first place!), the resulting story is disappointing. Vera Farmiga's character makes a final decision which is forced into the narrative; she needed more screen time for us to care. The main couple is also lacking moments to build up the chemistry between them.In short, there is a lack of passion. The credits start rolling when you realized you didn't feel a rush at any point. It's a movie you can watch with your head and be entertained, yes... but it never reaches the heart.",6,0,2,4 August 2011
Moulin Rouge!," Too many distractions
","I enjoyed watching this movie, especially for the stunning art direction and photography (though the editing was too fast and did not allow enough time to enjoy them).In my opinion, it does have a big problem, though. The story itself is relegated to a secondary role. It seems at times that the producer and director did not really believe in the main plot, so they filled up the screen with other things.Unfortunately, in the case of Moulin Rouge!, too many layers create more distraction than meaning.",7,1,2,8 October 2003
