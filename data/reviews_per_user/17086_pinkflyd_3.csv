The Blair Witch Project," Revolutionizes the Horror Genre!!!
","I saw a sneak preview of this movie in Pasadena, and I was just totally blown away at how great this movie is.  I can honestly tell you that this movie ranks with the classics of horror such as 'Halloween', 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and 'The Exorcist'.  It's been a long, long time since I've seen a movie that I can say was truly scary.  And this movie IS scary. I just cannot praise this movie enough.  It should go down in history as a landmark horror film.",10,1,2,23 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Somewhat disappointing, but redeemed in the final 30 mins
","My main complaint with this movie is that it's way too talky.  It has really great visuals and some great action sequences, but in between is a somewhat dull and plodding story.  However, the last 30 minutes really kick butt, and we finally get to see an intense lightsaber duel with Darth Maul and the Jedi masters, as well as some real 'Star Wars' style action.  My rating: 7 out of 10.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Very, Very Funny
","Although, I'm not a major South Park fan, I found this movie to be very funny, and often hilarious.  It's probably the most obscene, adult cartoon I've seen since 'Heavy Metal'.  It's sure to offend a great many people, but hopefully those people will take a close look at the movie, and see the somewhat serious message it's trying to make.",8,0,0,1 July 1999
