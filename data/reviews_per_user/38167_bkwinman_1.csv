The Blair Witch Project," Stupid Movie
","This film ranks among the dumbest I've seen, and it's outright ridiculous to compare it to the work of Hitchcock in suspense or fright.  But beyond that, are we to believe that these young adults didn't have the sense to go in one direction... they had a bright sun to guide them... or that it took them over three days to find their way out of a woods that only took them less than a day to enter.  The young woman, in fact, tells us that she spends her Sundays hiking through the woods near her home for enjoyment... yet she never learned to follow water downstream, or on which side of the tree the moss is on?  Besides that goof, there are many times when it would be ridiculous that anyone would be video recording what was going on, and there are also times when the camera catches all of the characters, one after another... so who's doing the filming? In all, I think this is another instance where Hollywood is expecting the audience to be morons and suspend their ability to make critical judgments.",Null,0,1,2 August 1999
