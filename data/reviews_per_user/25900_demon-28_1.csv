Changeling," Great but totally unbelievable
","I'd give this an 7 but hey, the plot has two huge holes that bugged me the whole time. The police told the boy to pretend he's her son (as it becomes clear in the end)?! That is beyond any logic - there is no chance that this would ever work in their favour.The kid that managed to escape hasn't called for what, 5-6 years? I won't even explain why this is just unbelievable.Everything else was just fine, even better - It was pretty much great overall but those two are the main pillars of the whole scenario and It totally ruined the aftertaste of the movie.",6,0,2,12 February 2012
