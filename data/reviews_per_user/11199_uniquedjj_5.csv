The Avengers," Avengers Assemble and Re-Assemble
","When i went to see this movie i believed the hype and was very anxious to see it. I was well prepared, i had seen all the relevant Marvel movies leading to this Avengers initiative. After seeing this movie i left the cinema that cold rainy night feeling overwhelmly satisfied. Rarely you find a gem of a film in life and this has to be one of them. Marvel's best live action movie since X-Men 2. I was gripped to my seat and didn't even notice the 2 hours slip by. I didn't even stay for the end credits where i'm told a small clip is played which will certainly mean a sequel. I didn't stay for the end credits because i spontaneously rushed to see this film alone for the first time in my life. Don't laugh!!! I only regret that i couldn't share this extravaganza with someone other then the strangers with me in the cinema.Great storyline, great special effects, great action, some comedy and soul. This film has it all and it's for everyone. Just don't see how they can make the sequel better than this but will be interested to see what else Stan Lee has got under his sleeves. 10/10",10,2,6,9 May 2012
Iron Man 3," Iron man 3
",After watching this movie and going through the whole trilogy you can feel a little disapponited. It is a very entertaining and humorous film. Robert Downey Junior and Gywneth Platrow give a great performance but the story itself has so many plot holes that it almost spoils the entire movie. Even if you are familiar with the whole Iron Man series you will still sit through this movie and ask a few questions. Another thing that upset me was what they done with the War Machine character played well by Don Cheadle. They could of done more with him and got him involved in more action scenes but he barely gets stuck in. Solid performances also by Guy Pearce and Ben Kingsley. Double villains with a twist. Special effects are as good as ever with any Marvel Comic Studio film.This is a great film despite the dodgy plot but if you can get past that you will enjoy this movie a lot. So i would say Iron Man 2 was slightly better than this sequel. Iron Man 2 i would rate as a 8.5 and Iron Man 3 a straight 8.SCENE LOOKOUT: Airplane scene with passengers and Irom Man,8,1,4,1 July 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Age of Surprises
","I went to see this sequel movie after seeing the first one thinking 'how can it top itself'. Well it did. It felt a little long but you feel it's necessary in the end for the plot of the whole story to come together. Remember the word 'togeher'. No spoilers.It starts off with a bang literally and just gives you enough time in between to take it all in. I always said that Avengers Assemble is one the greatest films of all time but this is even better. How can it be better? I keep asking myself. But the plot and sub plot of this movie is so well written and put together that it will make your toes curl. A great job by director Joss Whedon. Since there are so many characters involved i was surprised that the also got the continuity of the film spot on. With so many action packed twists to this thing, it's a great family movie.10/10 with out hesitation Go see it and be Marvelled.D",10,0,5,1 May 2015
The Matrix," Free your mind
","When i saw the trailer for this movie back in 1999 it looked good and i thought it was worth seeing but nothing prepared me for what i was about to watch at the cinema when it came out on my birthday that June. It blew my mind. I had never seen special effects like that before and the acting was spot on. Keanu Reeves was the perfect cast for the role as Neo. The directing was amazing and story was out of this world. The editing is flawless. The writing is brilliant with a lot of one liners such as 'follow the white rabbit' and 'if you take the red pill, you'll stay in wonderland and i'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes'. I was glued to the screen. This film is an innovation and changed cinema forever. All the groundbreaking filming techniques that were used in this movie has been referred to and copied by almost every successful sc-fi, thriller or action movie that has come out after the matrix. A movie that should be on your bucket list. If you have not seen this movie yet go see it now. You will not been disappointed. Even if you are not a sci-fi fan there's something here for everyone. It will excite you, free your mind and take you for a ride. WATCH IT NOW!!!! ADD THIS TO YOUR DVD COLLECTION.",10,0,0,8 December 2011
Deadpool," Ryan Reynolds is back!!!
","First of all i@m must say well done to Ryan Reynolds for his comedic performance in this superhero movie. I thought we saw the last of him after his last superhero movie, Green Lantern back in 2011 but he's come back ultra strong with this one, Bravo!!!Now this an R-rated so i would not advice a parent to bring their child to a screening. This film really is adult themed and could traumatize or badly influence you're young one, even though it's a comic book movie. There are some many inside jokes, references and Easter eggs here i have lost count. It pokes fun out of almost every single comic book origin film including Ryan's very own Green Lantern character. You will laugh hard seeing this film. If you don't, you're dead inside. I think this is quite a different type of superhero movie we are used to. Deadpool could really be described as an anti hero.Overall a very enjoyable movie. i can't wait for the sequel. Go see it now.",9,2,11,22 February 2016
