Insidious: Chapter 2," Confusing Plot..Not able to bind the Proper connection
",If i have to write down the broken links of this movie..may be i would need a full diary. Directors are not able to make proper connection between the events. Some of the good scenes which increases your heartbeat and really horrified you in some way but some was very bad like some childish Movie which used to scare infants. Gave 5 because of the bit of the horror content they showed which really scared me but in the end i got disappointed by the story. Only recommend for those who want to enjoy the horror without thinking :)I saw both the chapters and hope that directors are not planning for the next one.,5,0,0,31 December 2013
