The Blair Witch Project," I thought it was a comedy
","No joke, I spent more time laughing at this movie than anything else.  When Josh is crying and going, 'Why was it messing with my stuff?' or something, I was rolling!  Scary?  Nah.I know that we're talking about three suburban slackers who have led such pampered lives (they're going to film school, i.e. they don't want to work for a living) that they don't know their collective asses from a hole in the ground, but anyone with a GRAIN of sense who is lost in the woods might decide to FOLLOW THE RIVER, especially since they walked in a circle one day.  B-DUUUUHHHH!Heather Donohue is one of the worst actresses in recent memory and rivals Tony Montana and Vincent Vega for most uses of a certain expletive within a 90 minute span.  I'm sure her mother is quite proud that her vocabulary is so broad.  And you can't blame this on a scriptwriter, because there apparently wasn't one.This movie is a laugh riot!  It's really funny to see three doofi (plural of doofus) get turned around in the woods and yell at each other because there are no more cigarettes, but it ain't scary...not by a long shot.",2,1,3,17 November 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too much FX, not enough story
","As the Star Wars saga continues, each succeeding film has gotten more and more overblown with special effects and less and less concerned with plot and storytelling.  One need only compare the far superior alien creatures in the original Star Wars cantina to the muppets that sang in Jabba's lair or the cutesy wutesy Ewoks in ROTJ to see a prime example of how Lucas has altered his saga to cash in on certain focus groups.Now it's the end of the 20th century, and CGI is all the rage.  I don't know how much Lucas spent on the computer animation for The Phantom Menace, but he's DAMN sure proud of it.  Look at the setting shots of the city planet...four scenes of computer generated hover traffic.  Look at Jar Jar Binks, a creature created totally out of CGI and concocted specifically to give 8 year olds a favorite play toy (it didn't work, BTW)  See all the battle droids, marching in perfect CGI lockstep, signifying nothing.By the time Lucas is through, Darth Vader will have a pet Fengojuli which looks remarkably like Hello Kitty and speaks like Bubbles of the Powerpuff Girls.  Obi Wan will retreat to Tatooine, only to be taken in by the lovable CGI-created Winksnoozie tribe, a race of 3 foot high mini-kangaroo type people.George Lucas has proven that his ego is too much, and that is why Peter Jackson has smoked him with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  While Lucas was rewriting his latest chapter in the Star Wars marketing saga to appeal more to 14 year old N'Sync fans, Jackson was creating a solid trilogy of movies.It is an insult to his earlier work to call this excuse for a movie 'the beginning.'  More like, 'the result.'",1,0,1,17 December 2001
Memento," One big gimmick
","As I write this, Memento is listed as number 10 on IMDb's top 250. It is ahead of Apocalypse Now, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Dr. Strangelove, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Lawrence of Arabia, The Graduate, Raging Bull, The Sting, The Empire Strikes Back, The Wizard of Oz, The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Deer Hunter, Gone With the Wind, every Hitchcock movie, every Woody Allen movie, and every Kurosawa movie, except Seven Samurai, just to name a few.To hear the people on this board tell it, Memento is the 21st century's Godfather or Citizen Kane. I rented this film because of all the high praise it received. What I was treated to was an average film with only one outstanding performance (Joe Pantoliano), enough plot holes to drive a Jaguar through, and a gigantic gimmick that is as essential to the film as the shark is to Jaws.The movie is chopped into a number of scenes and shown in reverse. If one were to re-edit the film and show it front to back, it would be devoid of suspense. All the 'cerebral puzzles' etc. would be gone. Even in its weird order, it's not all that deep. The director uses the sequencing and the protagonists's disorder to keep the viewer guessing. It's all a big trick, and by the end, the viewer is just relieved that it is over.There may be real people who suffer from this inability to create new memories, but I highly doubt they are able to function effectively as Pearce's character did. Nor do they have a network of friends who help them function and fail to get them professional help, especially when they are on a homicidal vendetta.Do not waste your time here. This movie has been rated highly by a bunch of people who mistake directorial sleight of hand for real movie magic. Rent any of the films I mentioned in the first paragraph. They actually deserve their praise.",1,38,66,25 September 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Not much more than CGI pyrotechnics
","I am convinced that George Lucas could film 2 1/2 hours of his dog running around Skywalker Ranch, title it 'STAR WARS: Fido's Sunny Day,' and a cadre of pasty faced adolescents of all ages would waste weeks of their lives lined up to see it.The names 'Star Wars' and 'George Lucas' combined equal box office gold, no matter how rancid the actual film may be (See 'The Phantom Menace' for a prime example), so don't let high ticket sales fool you.  Neither should you be swayed by the high ratings on IMDB, a ballot box which the Star Wars faithful readily stuff.  The bottom line is that this is not a terrible movie, but it doesn't even touch 'Return of the Jedi,' let alone the other superior Star Wars movies.What we have here is a hastily written script that must conform to a pre-defined story line.  Take this exact script, change the names and the references so that it falls outside the realm of Star Wars, and you have a straight-to-video release that the Sci Fi network wouldn't even show.  But Lucas gave up on storylines long ago, figuring that one part Star Wars legacy plus two parts marketing hype plus three parts ILM wizardry equals one great movie.  Wrong.We have all these, of course.  We have Anakin and Obi Wan and Yoda and C3PO and R2D2 (who is becoming less cute and more annoying with each picture), each of whom is clumsily shoved into his role.  We have TV commercials and web sites and Happy Meals and enough toys, games, clothes, cups, etc to fill the Death Star three times over.  And we have Computer Generated Images. We have CGI galore!  We have spaceships and explosions and robotic armies and alien beings, all constructed solely from ILM pixels, out the wazoo.  But the whole is an empty product.  A soulless mess that looks more like a highly polished ripoff of other movies.For example, the first part of the movie contains a high speed chase through the hover traffic of Coruscant.  It looks as though Lucas lifted the traffic from 'The Fifth Element' and the cityscape from 'Blade Runner' (the cars are even referred to as 'spinners,' a direct reference to BR).  There is one of the most lackluster, uninspired love stories ever filmed that could have been lifted from a hundred different movies.  And the final scene (the only redeeming scene in the whole movie) smacks of 'Gladiator.'  Maybe this is Lucas' tip of the hat to Ridley Scott, or maybe it's just lazy filmmaking by a director who knows he's going to make his money back 3 times over.  I tend to side with the latter.Something else that Lucas just doesn't seem to realize is that special effects are there to accentuate a movie, not to substitute for the traditional conventions of plot, dialogue, and well-rounded characters. There is a reason that fireworks displays rarely go more than a few minutes. They are beautiful and exciting and awe-inspiring in short doses, but after an hour of floral shells, they all begin to look the same and your neck begins to hurt from craning skyward and you start to think about going home and hitting the sack.  The same can be said for movies.  The computer generated effects begin to wear thin, especially when there is anything but an interesting story behind it.  Lucas expects us to look at his handiwork and go, 'Ooooh! Cool!' but we've seen a lot of this before, and after two hours it just ain't that cool anymore.One last thing, there is one more movie left before 'Star Wars' is supposed to take place, but there are enough plot holes left to be filled by three more movies, which does not bode well for the next film.  I imagine 3/4 of the last Star Wars movie will be spent bridging gaping chasms between 'Attack of the Clones' and 'A New Hope' with awkward plotting and cheap devices.  A perfect example is this:  Anakin finds C3PO working on a moisture farm, the same farm that Luke is raised on.  In fact, Owen and Beru are there as well.  So how is it that 3PO doesn't recognize the farm when he and Artoo are sold in the original movie?  Better yet, how come Owen doesn't recognize 3PO when the jawas bring him by to be sold?  I'll bet 10 to 1 the droids get their memory erased or something equally cheap.The bottom line is this is a better film than 'The Phantom Menace,' but that's no great feat, not by a long shot.",2,0,0,29 June 2002
