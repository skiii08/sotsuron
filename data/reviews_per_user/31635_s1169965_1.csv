Kill Bill: Vol. 2," More Tarantino than the First Volume
","The character interaction was much more Tarantino than in the first volume. The dialogue between David Carradine, (Bill) and Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Michael Madson, (Budd) where done in the true Resevoir Dogs style.  I was pleased to see that Tarantino strayed a bit from the ultra-vivid backgrounds; instead selecting more grass-roots backdrops for the film. It just seemed like more of a Tarantino film than did Volume 1.  I am not saying the the second is superior to the first...rather that the second is more Tarantino than the first.  I will dare to say that the first was more entertaining, while the second was more content oriented.  A word to the wise...don't purchase the Kill Bill Volume 1 on DVD yet.  Wait for the dual-packaged box set which should be arriving in August.",9,1,2,16 April 2004
