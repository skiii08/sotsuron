The New World," David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com
","Wednesday January 18, 7:00pm Metro Cinemas, Seattle Opens Friday January 20'All is perfect. Let me be lost. You flow through me like a river.'The New World at its heart is the tale of an exceptional young woman and a legend in American mythology. The curious pondering of her existence in harmony with earth, sea and sky is profound and spiritual. 'You are our Mother. We rise out of the soul of you.' Oddly, her name (Pocahontas) is never spoken. The film reveals her idyllic world at the point of European discovery and she becomes a metaphor for paradise corrupted. The use of first person narrative with breathtaking visual montage is extraordinary: The river below mirrors an endless swath of migratory birds in flight, then, in the throws of new love she stands at the waters edge as a bolt of lightning pierces the twilight. Tension builds between rival factions as a sliver of moon appears long enough to reveal what is actually an eclipse, followed by an empty canoe, adrift, a fire burning at its center, preceding her despair and the carnage of battle. . A rough spot or two in the editing simply reveals the filmmakers endless tinkering. Once again Terrance Malick has created an operatic work of nearly unbearable beauty.",9,4,8,24 January 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com
","Wednesday March 8, 7:00pm The Harvard Exit'I live on both sides of the fence and the grass is always green.'Four violent murders are committed before the titles finish rolling in Lucky Number Slevin. Josh Hartnett in the title role plays the apparent victim of mistaken identity, drawn into a hornet's nest of gore as rival New York gangsters commit one revenge killing after another. Bloody executions for the unpaid gambling debt on 'a drugstore handicap' at the horse track serve as a flashback prologue and setup for eventual retribution. The final plot twist is so predictable it makes the hour and a half before it nearly a total snooze. High expectations that go with such a stellar cast, Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, Lucy Liu (She is too cute!), Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci and Hartnett all but guarantee disappointment. Lucky Number Slevin should play well to a teenage audience with its formulaic sex, violence, pyrotechnics and MTV style editing, but will come off as shallow, tasteless and unsatisfying to everyone else.",4,27,58,13 March 2006
Closer," David Jeffers
","Closer reveals the beautiful people being beautiful, or, lying liars and their lies. Another Mike Nichols portrayal of beauty in emotional distress, i.e.; Ann Margaret, Katherine Ross, Annette Benning, Sandy Dennis, Stockard Channing, Meryl Streep. A story of attraction and repulsion, Closer is well photographed with an interesting story and great casting. Urban London is a wonderful setting. From Nichols, who directed several of the finest American films of the '60s and '70s some of the most atrocious and embarrassingly bad dialog I can remember. All four characters are dishonest with each other and themselves, conniving, manipulative, and tormented by their own awful, immoral behavior. When Julia Roberts and Jude Law first kiss she presses the shutter release on the cable she is holding as though it's a metaphoric climax. I actually laughed out loud. Portman is the star of what could be her breakout film. The story also concludes well. Law's character is alone and discovers Portman's waif was never honest or really trusted him. Carnal Knowledge has been one of my favorite films since I first saw it in the seventies. There are similarities that would make this a suitable bookend to Nichol's career. Well worth seeing but by no means a major film.",Null,0,1,23 July 2005
The Illusionist," Seattle International Film Festival - David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com
","SIFF 2006, Opening NightThursday May 25, 7:00pm The Paramount TheaterOnce upon a time a peasant boy and a princess fell in love. The boy was driven away, only to return an accomplished magician, intent on winning back the princess from the evil prince. Neil Burger's The Illusionist is as complex as a child's bedtime story but without an ounce of surprise or originality. Eisenheim (Edward Norton) is appropriately austere, mysterious and the effects used to create his stage fabrications are technically beautiful, but the story reads like a facsimile of been there, done that. Sophie (Jessica Biel) is ravishing and dewy-eyed but has little to do. Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) plays a cartoonish villain and Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) is downright annoying. The concept and design are wonderful but bad Austrian accents, a disappointingly abrupt resolution and a tacked on montage revealing the true story further the disappointment in what might have been a much better film.",4,26,48,12 May 2006
World Trade Center," David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com
","Thursday July 27, 7:00pm The Harvard Exit'Pain is your friend. It means you're alive.'Oliver Stone's name above the title guarantees certain things. His films are well conceived, well executed, and unashamedly possessing his own unique political bent. They are undeniably compelling to an audience, deeply thought provoking, morally disquieting, often unpleasant and always psychologically traumatic. Stone's latest film, World Trade Center, draws the viewer into the lives of two New York City Police Officers on what was an average, ordinary day, until the surreal events of September 11th, 2001 made it horrifically extraordinary. The audience comes to this story, as with any depiction of historical significance, knowing what the characters do not. Stone has only to offer his perspective on the tragic outcome. Wonderful performances from Maria Bello and Michael Pena notwithstanding, World Trade Center is an indulgent, clichÃ© attempt to romanticize the plight of the victims, offered up as the respectful remembrance of events many politically sane Americans would prefer to forget.",5,7,20,29 July 2006
The World's Fastest Indian," Seattle International Film Festival preview - David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com
","Tuesday January 10, 7:00pm The Harvard Exit, Seattle Thursday February 2, 7:00pm The Uptown Theater, SeattleTake a little Cervantes, throw in some Monster Garage, add an afternoon tea break and you've got Burt Munro. He's a sweet old motorhead with a heart condition, who mows his lawn with gasoline and a lit match. Sir Anthony Hopkins is perfectly cast as the Kiwi curmudgeon who dreams of taking his ancient drag bike half way around the world to Speed Week on Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats. 'The World's Fastest Indian' chronicles the true story of Munro's impossible 1967 journey. He manages to avoid one disaster after another while endearing himself to a colorful menagerie of characters he meets along the way. The twenties era Indian Motorcycle is a work of art and the high speed film effects on the salt flats are wonderful. 'This guy is the real thing!' Anyone with a jones for vintage motorcycles and lost causes will love this reckless and happy little film.",7,1,2,29 January 2006
The Departed," David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com
","'Who the #&%* are you?''I'm the guy who does his job. Who are you?'How often have moviegoers observed that 'So-and-so hasn't made a decent film in years ' How often has that observation been true? Given this consideration, Martin Scorsese's latest film The Departed is an astonishing surprise. It is every bit the equal of his greatest triumphs. His portrait of Boston's Irish Mob, with its mix of loyalty, deception and underlying legacy, is told with a breathtaking visual narrative of explosive violence and its consequences, in the compelling style Scorsese is famous for. At its heart, The Departed is Jack Nicholson's film. He dominates the screen as the personification of willful menace and pure evil. The remaining cast rivals any Scorsese ensemble, with career defining performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Ray Winstone. With an unforgettable screenplay and a well-balanced score featuring everything from The Rolling Stones, to Patsy Cline and La Traviata, The Departed fulfills the promise seen in Scorsese's earliest work.",8,2,4,10 October 2006
Rosemary's Baby," David Jeffers for SIFFblog.com
","Tuesday October 31, 7:30pm, The Historic Lynwood Theater'Monsters, monsters, unspeakable, unspeakable!'Guy and Rosemary Woodhouse are average, happy newlyweds, until they move into an imposing, fortress-like apartment on Manhattan's upper West Side. Everyone else at The Bramford (Manhattan's notorious Dakota) seems oddly out of step with the world, older, a bit too friendly, and not quite what they seem. Roman Polanski's first American production, Rosemary's Baby (1968) is the story of a young woman (Mia Farrow) who has either become the innocent victim of a depraved Satanist cult, impregnated by the Devil himself, or has lost her mind to the hormonal ravages of pregnancy. Polanski's great delight in presenting stories from the point of view of the central character leaves the viewer wondering to the very last ambiguous shot. What remains indisputable however, is this films place as the finest, most original and frightening example of psychotic-nightmare horror to come out of new Hollywood and the inspiration for countless other films.",7,1,2,31 October 2006
