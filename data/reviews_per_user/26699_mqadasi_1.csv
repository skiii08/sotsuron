10 Cloverfield Lane," That's how woman's mind works!!!
","The story, acting, directing was good But the end was awful.It is in short about a woman who ruins her life, her boyfriend's life, two poor men's life , ruins an excellent shelter and a poor UFO aircraft.In my idea the good ending for this movie will be if she runs out of the shelter and the aliens kill her while the good fellow Howard watching that happily in his safe shelter.A good movie to me is that one which makes you live in the events as one of the characters. If the characters don't act in reasonable way that will take you out and lose your merge with the story.",6,1,3,21 October 2016
