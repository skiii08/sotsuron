Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat (2006) ***
","I still go to the theater, but rarely on a Friday or Saturday night. My wife, who's always into 'what's new', spontaneously suggested seeing this last evening and since it sounded humorous enough I took the chance. I'm glad I did, since I ended up having a great time and got to see a funny film with an appreciative audience who was in hysterics from start to finish! I'll say right from the beginning that my experience was enhanced by seeing this as movies were intended to be seen - with a fun audience having a great time together in the theater. I don't think it would nearly have been as much of a good time at home alone.Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) is a modest TV personality living in the 'backwards' (as the film portrays it) country of Kazakhstan, located in Central Asia. He sets out on a mission to America to make a documentary, first arriving awkwardly in New York City and then making his way slowly to California to search for Pamela Anderson after seeing her on an episode of Baywatch on his hotel television and falling in love with her. His wild and crude journey through the USA is continuously funny, and the rapid pace at which the gags are fired away is constant and never lets up. This is already a film that's being called disgusting, offensive, insensitive, you name it -- and I admired that it crosses many politically correct lines and may certainly get some panties twisted here and there, for people who take things too seriously. It's hard to dislike the naive character of Borat and I can't remember the last time I had this much fun with a comedy at the movies. *** out of ****",8,2,8,26 November 2006
The Incredible Hulk," The Incredible Hulk (2008) **
","** out of ****Laying my cards right out on the table here, I have long been a big fan of 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK' -- the comic book, I mean; not the old Bill Bixby TV show (which didn't get the comics right), and I'll pull no punches in stating that I hated the other HULK film (by Ang Lee) which was released only a few years back. So it was only fitting that a second attempt was made to try and capture a more respectable representation of Marvel's iconic 'Green Goliath'. The results here are a little better, but that's still not saying much because it too misses the essence of the original comic book character. It all boils down to a matter of personal preference, and it seems that Hollywood is trying to satiate the expectations of those who grew up with the Bill Bixby variety of Hulkiness from the TV series. Which means that we get 'ol' Jade-Jaws' as little more than an angry, roaring, enraged monster. It's a tragedy that filmmakers overlook the potential of the original Hulk comic character, who actually articulated with speech and therefore was able to come across as a more sympathetic, albeit child-like, character. There's more to the Hulk than just going 'RRRAARRRRGGGHHHH!!!!!!'.Edward Norton is physically a good choice to play a rather dweeby-looking Bruce Banner, if we're reflecting back to the old comic books (though we're not with this movie ... at least not very much). His love interest, Betty Ross, is also well-cast in Liv Tyler. She doesn't have much to do in the movie but that's okay since Betty was a nothing character in the comics as well. William Hurt is a pretty good Thunderbolt Ross, Betty's father and the General who's out to capture the Hulk ... though in the film he's way too villainous for his own evil purposes, where in the comics he was mostly apprehending Greenskin for the good of his country and to protect his daughter.One of Hulk's most enduring adversaries turns up in this new movie, The Abomination. There's not much to say about Tim Roth, who plays the human side of this creature until he later becomes a computer generated figure (along with the cartoony Hulk). These two titans get to clash, but it's all CGI fisticuffs, and now's as good a time as any to address this current cinematic problem. Why this reliance on computer animated characters when an actor could work out nicely, and appear more real? Lou Ferrigno might have looked funny 30 years ago in green body makeup, but prosthetics have come a long way since that time. As originally conceived, The Hulk need not be as humongous in size as these movies make him out to be (the original comics have him at only 7 feet), so he's not much bigger than The Thing from the Fantastic Four. They had the right idea in those FF films by having The Thing played by a real actor in a body suit. So they could have found an actor large enough to play The Hulk, and then perhaps CG-tweaked him a little, if he's to be larger.But ultimately, the cartoonishness of the Hulk and The Abomination is not what topples this house of cards anyway. It's because this feels like just an 'average' comic book film, without much of a story and not enough of the Hulk as a communicative lost soul. Think of the lonely speaking Frankenstein monster from BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN... this is the type of Hulk a movie of this type needs. I will say that, at the very least, THE INCREDIBLE HULK manages to provide its star with a few words... the patented 'Hulk Smash!!' and maybe one other, from what I remember. And there ARE brief moments where we do sense a twinge of sympathy and come to care about this green galoot... just a tiny bit. It was a hint of what could have been, had anyone in charge considered that there is more potential for this character than they think. ** out of ****",5,2,6,5 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) *
","(Possible Spoiler)I'm not a die-hard STAR WARS fan by any means, yet I recognize the original 1977 adventure as a very good throwback to the old time adventure serials, on which it was based. As of this writing I'm eager to familiarize myself with these movies in preparation for the newly released REVENGE OF THE SITH. I wanted to at least rent THE PHANTOM MENACE and ATTACK OF THE CLONES to get some sort of perspective.I actually saw PHANTOM MENACE upon its release in 1999; it wasn't very good to me then and I'm sorry to say that my home viewing of it for the second time last night appealed to me even less. I don't feel too clueless, as I'm aware that even many STAR WARS devotees also were disappointed with this one. It's just a chaotic mess, not very decipherable, and far too juvenile. To make matters even less bearable, some of the performers were poorly chosen. Chief on the list is little inexperienced Jake Lloyd, who is completely non-convincing as the one who'd become Darth Vader, as we all know. He doesn't come across as the 'wiz kid' or 'potentially dangerous' presence we keep hearing about from Liam Neeson's character. Lucas should have gone with the talented Haley Joel Osment (THE SIXTH SENSE)... he really could have pulled this part off. Natalie Portman is absolutely horrid as she plays the disinterested queen who slips in and out of her noble delivery, depending on whether or not she's in her makeup at any given moment. Only Denise Richards could have been less effective (maybe).The CGI effects are way too much, and often times I felt like I was watching an old Looney Toons comedy; hordes of silly-looking creatures, making funnies and acting all stupid. Which leads us to the irritating Jar-Jar Binks -- it was a disaster having this annoying character in the film. A good (I mean, bad) example of where these cartoony creatures really overstayed their welcome was during the popular 'pod race,' which was more mind-numbing than exciting. I couldn't make heads or tails out of it, and I couldn't wait until it ended.Thank heavens for Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor. On the plus side (and the only real thing this chapter has going for it), Neeson is magnificent in his role as the Jedi Master who has taught young Obi-Wan (another fine performance from McGregor) the ways of the Jedi. They make a perfect team, and it's a shame they were wasted in this muddled mess of a movie. I should mention that I thought Darth Maul made for a pretty good villain, but he was sadly under-used. Oh, yes - and the whole thing felt (surprise!) about 45 minutes too long. Oh well. Every series is entitled to have its turkey. Now I move on to EPISODE II... * out of ****",2,15,32,29 May 2005
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane (1941) ****
","I am totally elated to say I've just had my first - and by no means my last - wonderful experience with the well-labeled 'classic' that is CITIZEN KANE.I decided to see it bright and early, at 7:30 am where I could be at my most alert and perceptive. It did not disappoint me in a single way. And even though I was fully prepared in advance to think 'there's just no way this is going to be the 'best film ever made',' the more I became entranced in it, the more I understood precisely why so many fans and critics over the decades have bestowed such an honor on it. It's a truly great motion picture - and if I'm not presently prepared to call it 'The Single Greatest Film Ever Made,' I certainly think it's one of the greatest, at least that I've ever seen.I must say with regret, however, that I'd already heard what 'Rosebud' was before watching the movie, and that's a real shame. Because I would have been totally blown away by that bittersweet revelation had I not expected it. The only thing for me to hope for was that, at least, the manner in which this information was revealed in the film would be properly dramatic and effective, and not just some character telling its meaning or some other less than stellar presentation. I was actually hoping that the movie would end with the 'Rosebud' object somehow being amidst Kane's personal possessions -- but who would ever have though that it was going to be SO brilliantly revealed - with such grandeur! Absolutely perfect - drama at its finest!The performances were marvelous, beginning with Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten (what a shame to think Cotten was ultimately to be handed such junk as LADY FRANKENSTEIN later on). I spotted people I never expected to see, such as George Coulouris as Thatcher (another who wound up in Grade Z horrors like 1957's THE MAN WITHOUT A BODY!).I was totally intrigued with the character of Chuck Kane continuously, and I loved the manner in which this well-crafted story was told via flashbacks and time leaps backward and forward. Of course, the cinematography was second to none and, I imagine, astonishingly fresh and innovative for its day. Dialogue was great, too; I particularly liked one funny bit where the elderly Thatcher tells the young adult Kane: 'You're too old to call me 'Mister'', to which Welles replies, 'and you're too old to be called anything else' ! Orson Welles was a genius with this work of art. I can't wait to dig into the documentary, and perhaps even Roger Ebert's commentary. To think that Welles was so young when he fashioned this beautiful film, and had complete creative license! This is what I like with a director when I can get it - one who is in charge of everything, not just someone who is merely directing someone else's ideas. I like a director to conceive, write, direct, and edit everything (at this point I'm not positive that Welles did it ALL, but he did enough!).Well, I could go on forever at this moment, but I'll let others get a word or two in. All I can say is - if you hadn't guessed by now - this baby's got a space on my shelf with its name on it! And by the way, EXCELLENT restoration job, Warner!",10,9,15,10 June 2004
Dawn of the Dead," A good zombie movie ***
","I've always been known to trash needless 'remakes' of films, and especially the more recent re-do's. I think it's become a celluloid disease that's really infested cinema these days and there aren't a whole lot of fresh ideas remaining, specifically in the Horror genre. Having gotten this out of the way, there are exceptions to every rule and all you die-hard Romero fans might as well get your stones ready for hurling at me right now, because I may actually like the 2004 version more than the 1978 film.In all honesty, other than spending some of its time in a shopping mall there really isn't all that much direct similarity between this new DAWN and the original; hell, this movie could have been called something else entirely (NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES, 28 DAYS LATER or anything) and then it wouldn't have mattered to hardcore purists as much, because this film is very much its own animal. We all know that the real business reasoning behind using the title DAWN OF THE DEAD was to lure in the hardcore fan base. So it's best to approach this experience as just another 'end of the world'/'zombie takeover' situation on its own terms.Still, comparisons (thanks to the title) are bound to crop up. I found these ghouls to be a refreshing change from the traditional slow-moving ones; I'd be much more terrified at having a carnivorous flesh-eating cannibal hot on my ass running after me than I would one of those old fashioned crawlers who could easily get knocked to the ground by a good sneeze from my nostrils. This doesn't mean I don't retain my fondness for the more limping, arthritic type of zombie of yesteryear; it just means I thought this change was welcome and posed a greater threat. Since whatever is ailing these creatures is never explained, I also had no problems believing it could make them speedy and even roar like wildcats. Hey, at least it makes them fearsome.It's been claimed that the characters in this new version are not sympathetic nor well developed, and I take serious issue with that... On the contrary -- it's the characters of the 'original' DAWN OF THE DEAD whom I've never felt anything for. But in the 2004 film - and this is especially true regarding the favored Director's Cut - these people are exceptionally well defined and distinct from each other. There are heroes (Ving Rhames) and there are villains in this predicament (the security creep). Sweet guys and jerky guys (the dope with the boat is a perfect example of the latter). Guys you can feel sorry for (like Andy on the roof or that poor soul who has to face a crucial decision late in the fight). And no matter which version you prefer, Sarah Polley runs circles around Gaylen Ross in the Leading Lady Department.Zack Snyder is no genius (after all, he still allowed inappropriate hard rock music into the soundtrack for one thing), but he's directed a pretty good thriller with an end-of-the-world feel. This is especially felt in the knockout pre-credits sequence. There are plenty of exploding heads and gore to please fans of the original yet not go into overkill mode as happened the first time. It's not perfect and it's not as horrifying as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, nor is it as uncomfortably apocalyptic as DAY OF THE DEAD ... but for all intents and purposes that are forever open for debate, it IS more fun for me than that other Romero zombie film that fits between those two.",7,1,3,9 January 2005
12 Angry Men," 12 Angry Men (1957) ***1/2
","For viewers out there who don't like 'old movies' or 'black and white,' please give this gem a try. I think you'll find it completely engrossing. It's a masterful piece of work, expertly directed by Sidney Lumet and contains no sex, explosions or special effects, not even a single female (it's still worth it!). Flawlessly acted by fine performers: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, etc. The simple setup involves only 12 jurors in a little juror's room, nothing else. It's the power of the story and the interaction between the varied personalities of these men that keeps you riveted. It's why less can be more when it's done well.SPOILERS AHEAD:It's perfect symmetry the way these men each have a personality all his own: the liberal, the bigot, the wise man, the jerk, the haunted man, the immigrant, the hard worker, the know-it-all, etc.... During the course of this film we get to know them all, maybe can identify with one or two. There's an air of Political Correctness which tends to favor the liberal side, painting the 'guilty' voters as racists, loudmouthes with personal agendas, or ignorant sports fans. It's because of this (and more objections) that I'm hesitant to award the movie a complete 4-star rating. It's a 'great' film, but I just cannot call it 'excellent' when I can't seem to side with Fonda's noble cause. From the moment we see Fonda (Juror 8) in angelic white, he's a 'do-gooder'. He 'says' that he does not really know if the young defendant is innocent of killing his father, but his facial expressions and sighs of relief tell me he had his mind made up to free this boy all along. Fonda even goes out of his way to buy a knife - BREAKING THE LAW IN DOING SO - just to plead innocence for the kid. He constantly asks jurors: 'isn't this possible?' but the same could be asked by other jurors and their ideas. Our justice system is a scary mess. because I believe ANY murder case can have 'reasonable doubts' raised in them, if someone wants them to. So no witnesses are ever to be considered reliable? Luckily for the kid here, one of the jurors wearing glasses scratched his nose, so there's an instant case for 'reasonable doubt' because a juror recalls that a female witness also rubbed her nose (maybe she wore glasses). There is a lonely old juror who observes that an elderly witness seemed lonely and ashamed. So this juror 'relates' to him and decides that the old witness may have wanted to 'appear important' and so maybe his testimony was unreliable! A truly guilty man could get released by this! Whenever Fonda wants something to fit his agenda for 'not guilty,' he believes the old witness' every word; when it won't help his cause, he dismisses his feeble testimony! There's a crude re-enactment where Fonda hobbles around to determine if the old witness was able to get to his door in 15 seconds as he testified - it actually takes 41 seconds - but is this as conclusive as Fonda claims? Maybe the man was mistaken when he said '15 seconds'; maybe the man said '50' . Fonda doesn't care; this is one of those times he'll trust the man's testimony if it proves his agenda! He sure works awful hard to ignore anything the other jurors suggest. The boy claims he was at the movies when the murder was committed, yet one hour later cannot recall anything about the films he watched. How does Fonda chip away at this evidence? He tests juror E. G. Marshall by asking him if HE recalls what HE did last night. When Marshall easily replies, Fonda goes back to the night before. Marshall still doesn't miss a beat, so Fonda goes back a couple more days (why doesn't he just go back three years?) until he's back to a week. Naturally, Marshall eventually can no longer remember, so a 'point' is supposedly made (um, not really). Is Fonda correct that some of his points are feasible? Yes - but so are the others'. 'Juror 8' won't give up until the kid's life is spared, it seems. Even when the 'guilty' voters suggest to 'have a hung jury,' Fonda will not accept. It's not good enough for him. Here's the key to me that Fonda's not interested in a 'fair verdict': Jack Warden votes 'not guilty' with all the others, just because he doesn't care and wants to get out. If Fonda was so self-righteous, he should have gracefully said: '11 of us have now voted 'Not Guilty'. But I cannot accept the 12th vote, as this man is only voting for whatever verdict will let him get out of here'. But Fonda will take it -- the boy's free, even if he had to get one 'fake' vote to achieve it.We have to give the benefit of the doubt. I don't want an innocent man executed. But nor do I want guilty predators freed because a witness 'had lines on her nose,' or 'maybe that witness lied to feel important.' When Fonda says 'this isn't a game!', it seems to me the jury system IS a game - who can think of a twist the fastest, who has the best lawyer. I think Fonda plays a 'game' very well and won - even if society lost. Because when he marches out of court at the end, thinking he's a hero, I can't help thinking he let a killer fall through the cracks to satisfy his own conscience. Still, I wish I could side with him. I think this is a more fulfilling film for those who do, and I believe we're supposed to. Either way, this is a very powerful piece of cinema. That's the main thing.***1/2 out of ****",9,4,8,29 September 2004
Hostel," Hostel (2005) ***
","Eli Roth's brilliantly horrifying story of what fate awaits three young men looking to sow their wild oats while vacationing in Europe. They're introduced to a strange Slovakian land where sexy foreign women are always willing to bed down with any male (especially if they're Americans) and fulfill every one of their fantasies. After a period of partying and cheap thrills, these friends discover they're nothing more than unlucky possessions in grisly games of torture and death.I think the gradual unraveling of how these sadistic events come to be ia very intriguing and distrubingly real. I've subsequently learned that there were at least two endings filmed, and without going into detail I'll just say that the version which was re-shot to play in theaters upon the movie's original release was the much stronger and satisfying of the two.",7,1,3,8 January 2006
The Notebook," The Notebook (2004) **1/2
","I try to be a fair partner when it comes to my relationships with the opposite sex, and unfortunately my girlfriend is a hopeless romantic when it comes to her movies and books. She is willing to check out most of the films I enjoy (with the exception of more explicit horror films; she tells me they give her nightmares), so I think it's only fair that I endure some of her favorites now and then. So last evening we watched her DVD of THE NOTEBOOK. It stars Rachel McAdams and Sam Shepard. Now let me see if you've heard this one before: A young girl (McAdams) is at first turned off to a demonstrative young man (Shepard). Eventually he grows on her and they fall madly in love. Problems arise when the girl's parents feel the boyfriend is not the best choice for her. So she finds another boyfriend. But her first lover doesn't give up... and then... I did not hate the film. Actually, even though it's mostly predictable and it's typical of millions of other chick flicks like it, I did appreciate the way it was structured. It's a story set in the 1940s that's told in flashback from a 2004 hospital as an elderly man (James Garner) reads the story to an old woman suffering from Alzheimer's (Gena Rowlands). The revelation here was not unpredictable either from the get go, but the film itself doesn't make a mystery out of it by the midway point anyway. I did get emotional during the final few scenes of the movie, and I'll tell you one thing - some sad things in life scare me more than those make believe horror films which my girlfriend prefers to avoid. **1/2 out of ****",6,0,0,9 February 2013
Blade," Decent for a modern vampire film **
","Much to the movie's advantage, Wesley Snipes plays it fairly straight and serious as a half-man/half-vampire slayer, based loosely on a character from Marvel Comics. Kris Kristofferson is impressively quite well-cast as his mentor, and the same goes for Stephen Dorff as the lead villain.This is dark, solid action (a la BATMAN '89) with decent performances; unfortunately, there are also too many needless obscenities from the vampires' mouthes and those typically artificial '90s computer effects which become cumbersome liabilities and prevent this from being as good as it might otherwise have been.",6,0,6,8 August 2004
The Mummy," The Mummy (1999) BOMB
","CGI-infested, comical garbage ... an insult to moviegoers, or it should be -- because this idiotic film actually has its supporters. Mummy? What 'mummy'? All we get is what amounts to an animated, computerized, cartoony cousin to the Terminator skeleton that actually 'talks' (!?) with a patented deep and demonic-sounding voice. But, mercifully, at least this thing's only on screen for a few minutes of this atrocity; the rest of the time we're pulverized with non-stop and ultra-cartoony computerized effects and inane humor, the type of which were so prevalent in American horror films of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, that it's becoming increasingly unlikely year after year that a decent monster flick can ever be made again.In his other incarnation, the bald-headed and very human-looking 'Im Ho Tep' (who has the habit of elongating his open mouth extra wide for no apparent reason other than to utilize the rubbery computer fx) is a pathetic excuse for the title character, and Brendan Fraser is no Indiana Jones, despite his (and the film's) efforts to accomplish precisely that. The characters are idiotic and my mind was so blitzed out by the over-use of computer effects that I didn't even know what I was looking at most of the time. And the stupidity! I knew I was in for trouble the moment those bookcases toppled over like dominoes in that library.Senseless, plot-less, meaningless, mind-numbing, CGI-diarrhea'd, stinking rubbish. This kind of material was far better respected even when Abbott and Costello met their mummy. 0 out of ***",1,3,9,21 December 2004
Orphan," Orphan (2009) ***1/2
","I expected this to be just another 'evil child' film, but it turned into a very pleasant surprise and is one of the finest new horror movies I've seen in quite awhile, from the maker of 2005's HOUSE OF WAX (which I also enjoyed). A young couple with two children adopt a very unique little Russian girl who turns out to be a terror with a past history nobody could have known. The first half hour or so plays like a typical 'bad seed' formula movie, but once it kicks into gear it remains intense, intriguing, and frightening, with a twist. Performances are top notch all the way around, with young Isabelle Fuhrman especially effective as the title character. I'm not sure whether or not this is a remake of anything that's gone before, but if it is it's a damn good one. Also contains one memorable movie quote delivered by the Orphan one evening when she confronts her new stepbrother in his room. ***1/2 out of ****",9,2,5,2 August 2009
Terminator Salvation," Terminator Salvation (2009) **1/2
","I approached this fourth entry in the Terminator series with many reservations, knowing it was going to be nothing more than a wild, overblown, CGI-fest. But then I figured while I waited to buy my ticket: 'well, isn't that what this particular chapter ought to be?', and it worked out okay with me. After all, if you're a fan of the other Terminator films like I am, you already know this day has been long coming where the machines will destroy mankind and the remaining humans who make up 'The Resistance' are going to try to fight them and remain alive, to protect what's left of the human race. So what other way is there to show so much gross chaos and devastation? Much as I don't support overused CGI on principal, it seems that this type of movie would not have been as possible 25 years ago. Luckily, this is not 'all' special effects. I was clued in on some of the plot details beforehand by foolishly reading a newspaper review (which also spoiled a surprise late in the show which I won't get into here), but as slight as the story is, at least there is one ... with John Connor (now appropriately played by the heroic Christian Bale) trying to locate the teenage Kyle Reese who, as we already know from the original TERMINATOR, will be Connor's own father. Thrown in for good measure is a second hero with a past history that's kind of interesting. Not a good movie, nowhere hear as great as the first two, and probably a notch below Number Three. I liked the casting of Christian Bale in this, given his popularity with the new Batman movies and also because he is believable in the part of a strong leader. But as an added bonus, Bale is much more acceptable as the grownup version of Edward Furlong (from T2) compared to the badly miscast Nick Stahl (T3). **1/2 out of ****",6,3,6,24 May 2009
Spider-Man 3," Spider-Man 3 (2007) **
","I enjoyed the first film, and even the second, though maybe to a lesser degree. But this third one is easily the least of the group and leaves my brain rattled. Where to begin? Well, for starters there were too many villains crammed into it, and no clear cut story but rather a series of back and forth jumping to all sorts of unrelated business which left me bored: let's throw in a disgruntled Harry Osbourne as the new Green Goblin (with yet another tiresome love triangle between him and Peter and MJ), then toss in the new Sandman adversary too, then cough up a token appearance by Venom later on for good measure, and also have Peter Parker contending with a strange and unidentified black substance from a fallen meteor which comes to take him over.... There's so much reliance on trying to squeeze in many various plot devices that there winds up being not much of a plot at all in the end. And the video game-like and cartoony CGI ---- what a mess! A classic case of over-abundance with fake looking Road Runner-ish chases and phoniness. Moviegoers today are supposedly less wowed by yesterday's more 'primitive' special effects, so how do they eat this crap up when it looks so artificial? I will concede, however, that the CGI was best put to use in the character of the Sandman, and it was probably the best way to render him (ditto for the 'spidey alien suit'). Incidentally, the Sandman's back story had the most potential and he could have been quite the sympathetic villain, had the script opted to concentrate solely on his story rather than trying to wedge so many different elements together.I really have never liked Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane and it didn't change with this film either. Even worse, this time we get stuck having to hear her character sing badly.. and oh, yes, she still has that annoying habit of running off to flirt and 'Twist' with whatever other guy floats her boat any time her relationship with Peter Parker hits a bump for a second. I'm so sick and tired of her and her petty jealousies. I wanted her snaggle-toothed ass dead when she was caught dangling high above from that web and Spidey had to save her yet again! Do ya hear me? Dead!! I really wish Peter would get his act together and hook up with blonde Gwen Stacy instead. So now let's address Peter Parker. I don't recall the comic book Parker being quite SUCH an extreme geek as in Sam Raimi's three film incarnations ... a real nerd, always crying his redundant tears, always whimpering. In the new film we get to see a welcome 'bad' side to Peter with his black alien suit morphing onto him, but while it's refreshing, there is no rhyme or reason to what that strange black gooey substance from space is in the first place, or why it's even around. It's just another of many endless plot contrivances. And count me in with the viewers who shook their head in embarrassment and disbelief when Peter starts acting like John Travolta while doing his absurd disco moves and idiotic 'cool guy' dancing schtick. This was completely ridiculous.Did I mention that the film is needlessly overlong and feels like it? I couldn't wait to get the hell out of the theater and for this aimless montage to end. When the film ended, a dad in his forties in front of me yelled: 'I want my money back!!', and I couldn't agree more. Another MAJOR disappointment for me was that this new film takes the liberty of changing the events of the first SPIDER-MAN, where it's suddenly revealed via repetitious black and white flashbacks that the guy who killed Peter's uncle Ben was not the right guy after all ... now it's supposed to have been the Sandman! How lovely. So now this completely ruins the effect of the original movie, and all those bits of business with Peter going after that first killer in Part One.

Match Point," Match Point (2005) ***
","A young Irish tennis instructor marries a woman he's not very much in love with to gain prominence through her family, but begins to have a fling with an American girl (Scarlett Johansson) and then a real dilemma he has to contend with. This glorified Woody Allen film really lived up to its hype. All I figured going in was that it was going to be a love story with a boring tennis backdrop, but I got a lot more than I bargained for, especially with the wild direction things took later in the story ... I never expected it.I loved the camera work here, a lot of really beautiful cinematic touches. It helped a lot that the story takes place in England, which is a much-welcome break from Allen's typical Manhattan scenarios and affords an opportunity for some very nice scenic touches. The sex scenes are hot and steamy, and it's a credit to Allen that he manages to make them so exciting even without resorting to showing blatant nudity.Scarlett Johansson is physically beautiful, but she leaves something to be desired for me in the acting department, at least during the first half (she got better later). The real star of the piece is Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the tennis pro whose life is in turmoil. He's just superb and runs the gamut with a varying degree of emotions in a multi-layered character. And I'm glad there wasn't too much tennis in this! I had feared the worst on that score from the start. This is a great achievement for Woody Allen, one of the best films he's ever done, and a triumph he needed in recent years. It's so different from most of his other movies. *** out of ****",7,0,1,16 January 2009
Midnight in Paris," Midnight in Paris (2011) **1/2
","Another small and charming romantic comedy from the always-reliable Woody Allen that's becoming harder to find in a sea of overblown, overlong, special effects bonanzas. It's a story of a young modern-day American writer named Gil (Owen Wilson), spending time in France with his fiancé (Rachel McAdams) and her parents, who is disenchanted with life in the 21st Century and longs for the better things of the past. His girl and prospective in-laws don't understand and are downright dismissive of him. One night Gil gets the unexpected thrill of his life when he boards a magical cab which time warps him back into the glorious 1920's where he becomes elated at meeting many of his idols all conveniently in the same place at the same time (Cole Porter, Pablo Picasso, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, Salvador Dali, Gertrude Stein). Owen Wilson is pretty good at playing what basically comes down to Woody Allen himself (I could easily see Allen in the part, but he's almost 80 these days so he has young actors doing his nebbish schtick for him). This is a cute enough movie that's worth seeing at least one time. Woody has tapped into similar romantic territory before, so it's not really very new for his regular fans. I can't say I agree with his unoriginal moral of the tale though: that in the long run, 'the good old days' are supposedly a fantasy, and we will ultimately find out that the past was no great shakes either. (I'd beg to differ there, Woody.) **1/2 out of ****",6,2,5,13 June 2011
Cloverfield," Cloverfield (2008) ***1/2
","You'd never know it by its generic title, but this is actually one of the finest films about a giant monster destroying a big city ever made. The entire 'movie' is captured on someone's camcorder a la THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (and recovered, we learn at the start of the film, from 'what was once Central Park'), as a secured government document of the tragic events which a small group of twenty-somethings experienced first-hand. What begins as a harmless home video party at a club in New York City abruptly turns into a long night of mass destruction and decimation, as some type of unexplained creature devastates Manhattan. This is not so much a movie about the creature as it is an intense and downright unnerving POV exercise that puts us as viewers into the chaos. Some scenes play very much like that fateful day of 9/11/01, and any person who witnessed that paralyzing event of buildings collapsing and smoke and debris gushing down the avenues will likely be revisiting the visuals in their minds.I've heard people complaining of nausea and dizziness over the filming technique, but the camcorder craziness didn't bother me as I knew what the movie was trying to do and I just went with it. The special effects here are outstanding, and the monster is never shown all that much to ruin the illusion. I'd also call CLOVERFIELD one of the more genuinely scary monster movies I've seen in a dog's age. You really feel like you're a part of the destruction and it seems very realistic. Would I go so far as to predict future 'classic' status for this film? Not sure. I do think the tendency by the general public these days is to move on to the next popular movie, and nothing retains a hold on viewers today like cinema giants used to, when life was simpler and perhaps offered not nearly as numerous entertainment options. But it's still what I'd consider a great monster movie. I'd also advise fans who want to see it NOT to wait for video; this needs to be seen on the big screen with thundering sound effects for best impact. ***1/2 out of ****",8,2,6,23 January 2008

","I suppose JEDI is now chronologically to be considered the very 'last' entry in the popular saga, and it's a very good one, as were several of these. I liked how directly this sequel took off after THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and I appreciated the maturity of Luke Skywalker as a character(and also Mark Hamill, as an actor). After hearing so many negative things about the Ewoks, they weren't so bad. I enjoyed the thrilling chase within the woods, and I felt there was a lot of well-realized emotion with this chapter. The ending (with some new additions, I presume?) successfully weaves all 6 chapters into a wonderful tale of fantasy. I know many true Star Wars fans hated George Lucas for changes he made to the original films, but being a relative novice to these movies rather late in life and not missing what I didn't already know, I think he made these 6 movies work perfectly as a whole entity. Oh, and, err -- Carrie Fisher looked quite delicious in her skimpy outfit. ***1/2 out of ****",8,0,1,29 August 2006
MASH," Mash (1970) ***1/2
","Though I never gave the TV show enough of a chance (too young to appreciate it at that time I suppose), I quite enjoyed the movie. A funny black comedy with well-defined characters and well-chosen actors to play them. I thought I'd never relate to anyone other than Alan Alda to embody the witty persona of Hawkeye Pierce, but a young Donald Sutherland fit the bill to a tee. Likewise for Robert DuVall as the morally preachy Frank Burns who turns hypocrite when lusting after the equally stuffy 'Hot Lips' Houlihan (a role played to perfection by Sally Kellerman). This was also the first time I recall enjoying Elliott Gould in anything.MASH succeeds as an unconventional twist on the Korean War by concentrating on the insubordinate antics of the men and women caught up in its horrors as workers at a U.S. Medical Unit. While it's effective enough as the dark comedy it is, I think it might have benefited even more by contrasting the quirky humor with occasional sharp doses of biting reality and real-life tragedy. If director Robert Altman tried to do that via the bloody surgical sequences, it doesn't come off quite as strong today. The somber title theme, 'Suicide is Painless' is a tune that will stick in your mind even after the movie ends.",9,2,6,4 January 2005

","Dreadful. Everything is wrong with this sequel to the enjoyable BLADE, and its faults are typical of what's wrong with a large number of modern 'horror films': all action and assaulting sfx and practically nothing else. I'm generally not a fan of CGI, but the computer graphic effects here are exceptionally amateurish and fake-looking. The characters on screen fight each other and leap about, looking as fake as those unreal computer game people the kids love to play with. In fact, when I saw this pathetic excuse for a movie in the theater I was so insulted that in my frustration I uncharacteristically leapt up for a few seconds for all to see, angrily pretending that I was manipulating Nintendo joysticks in some silly video game. My wife was embarrassed by this, as it's something I'd never do in the middle of a movie. I sat down quickly, but she wasn't nearly as red-faced by my behavior as I felt while watching this garbage. It's also a dark and dingy experience, very long, and all of its characters are equally uninteresting. Boring as hell in spite of all the mindless action bombarding you at every angle. Oh, and there also is some lousy Rap 'music' tossed into the toilet with regularity too. This movie is the absolute epitome of everything I despise in so many horror films of this period. 0 out of ****",1,9,18,4 October 2006
Shutter Island," Shutter Island (2010) ***
","Engaging if overlong film from Martin Scorsese based on the novel. Leonardo DiCaprio is a U.S. Marshal in 1954 who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to a heavily guarded mental institution for the criminally insane, far off on a creepy island. He's there to investigate the recent escape of a female patient who drowned her three children, and to possibly uncover what he feels are some unorthodox brain treatments on some of the inmates. He may even have a chance to confront and get revenge on a convict who was responsible for killing his wife two years earlier. Scorsese really handles this material well, but the viewer needs to pay close attention because there are so many twists and turns during DiCaprio's journey that things may sometimes become confusing. However, everything manages to make sense in the end, which is always what's important in a maze of a movie such as this. Leonardo's character is complicated because he plays a cop who had to kill many men during the war, and as a result has to contend with flashbacks which affect his work and better judgment. The rest of the cast is splendid, among them Max von Sydow as the elderly head psychiatrist, and especially Ben Kingsley as the mysteriously evasive and multi-layered head doctor who DiCaprio must deal with during his investigations. The ending wasn't really anything I couldn't have figured out, which is partly why I haven't rated the movie higher (that along with its excessive length and some possible lingering plot holes). But on the plus side, this is a film that I think may reward with a second viewing, and could conceivably come out with a slightly higher score next time. *** out of ****",8,1,4,20 February 2010

","(Possible Spoilers)I really had a good time with ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and it was an immense and welcome relief after squirming through THE PHANTOM MENACE. What impressed me right off the bat were the towering galactic cities, and much of the architectural design in general. It also became evident right from the start that we were going to be told more of a direct story this time around, with a plot that was not nearly as impossible to follow as it had been with Episode One. You still may need a score card to keep track of all the oddly named characters, but at least there's more substance to them.Ewan McGregor takes top honors as the best actor this time around, in his role of a more adult Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hayden Christensen is on and off in his so-so rendering of the growing Anakin Skywalker, and while Natalie Portman is still not much of an actress, she's not as bad here as she was the last time and at least we get to see her Queen Amidala fall in love with Anakin. This budding romance is also a great benefit to the film. I enjoyed the action sequences too, ranging from the flying 'space car' chase to the clone battle scenes, to the varying lightsaber duels. An added treat for an old time horror/sci-fi veteran like me was getting to see film legend Christopher Lee in the villainous role of Count Dooku, trading lightsaber jousts not only with Obi-Wan, but also Yoda! A personal highlight for me, and a moment full of action and suspense.There were some down sides too, though they didn't spoil the overall experience. The film is still a little padded and overlong at two hours and twenty minutes, and while I wasn't bugged out by the over-reliance on computer effects this time, occasionally I had to grimace when 'people' were animated. It's one things to create a mythological creature on the big screen; it's another to animate the very human character who's riding on its back or being thrown off it.But all this aside, I liked ATTACK OF THE CLONES and I am now poised to make my way to the theatre for the recently released REVENGE OF THE SITH.

","After seeing the very good THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS, I've come to regard M. Night Shyamalan as the 'Savior of Modern Horror'. He's a brilliant director who takes the offbeat material seriously and always maintains a quality approach to his films. It turns out that THE VILLAGE is not really a bonafide 'horror film,' though, and it's perhaps best approached with that in mind. I liken it to an overlong TWILIGHT ZONE fantasy television episode that might have been more effective at 30 minutes opposed to its 120. It's beautifully shot with a wholesome feel for the 1800s, and more than a few surprises (the shocking stabbing scene comes to mind). Bryce Howard gives a good performance as the lovestruck blind girl of the story, and William Hurt is strong, too. THE VILLAGE is a flawed movie that isn't on par with THE SIXTH SENSE or SIGNS; it's not a 'great' film by any means, nor even a 'very good one'... but it works well as a fairytale that plays on people's fears, and I liked that about it.",6,0,0,1 August 2004

","It was another unnecessary remake of a fairly recent film, but what can I tell you? As of this moment I've actually never seen Wes Craven's well-regarded 'original' (as it must now forever be tagged thanks to the co-existence of this retread) so I didn't have any biased personal vendetta against it. Besides, the word on the street was pretty good about this new one and I must confess that the trailer I saw looked promisingly unsettling. So the wife and I went to see it, and we both hated it. For one thing it took forever to get started, and by the time things started coming alive we had come to dislike the main characters enough that we didn't care what happened to them anyway. Typical 'false jump scares' were the order of the day, and what does happen to our doomed cast members goes way overboard on excess over suspense and terror, so this was pretty worthless in the end (and what a dumb end, too). To add insult to injury, before the movie we also were 'treated' to the trailer for the equally-un-needed OMEN remake (which I WON'T be seeing). 0 out of ****",1,0,2,1 September 2006

This time his would-be assassin is a gorgeous though deadly 'Terminatrix' (Kristanna Loken) sent back to try and accomplish what the last two males could not succeed at doing. The eager Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his third appearance, as yet another friendly cyborg who's hot on T-X's high heels to protect young Connor. After the mind-blowing spectacle that was TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY there was just no way this third film could compete. It also feels very much like a rehash of what we've already seen twice before. But yet it remains enjoyable enough due to Arnold, and even more so thanks to Ms. Loken's sexy yet locked-in version of the ominous female killing machine. I have a real problem with Nick Stahl in this movie, as he looks nothing like Edward Furlong (the kid from T2) and his rather delinquent character as written doesn't seem up to the task that's expected of him in the quickly brewing Rise of the Machines. *** out of ****",7,0,0,25 May 2009

","DUCK SOUP is a consistently funny comedy that never slows down, and takes honors as the best of all the Marx Brothers' movies. Comedy is largely a subjective matter, but for me this film easily earns its place atop the AFI Greatest List. Those looking for a plot (ha!) would do well to stop wasting their time -- this is the surreal world of the early Marxes we're talking about, after all! Groucho has rarely been more naughty with a choice selection of witty lines and insults. Harpo is a hilarious nuisance as he drives Edgar Kennedy (the perfect foil) out of his mind with hats, nuts and lemonade - and Chico is perfectly on cue working alongside him. As much as I've come to enjoy their piano and harp playing, it's refreshing to have Chico and Harpo take somewhat of a break from their instruments this time out, too.DUCK SOUP also returns Margaret Dumont to the mayhem, and hers is a very welcome presence, as always. She'll always be Groucho's number one leading gal for me.Along with the amusing and clever mangling of politics, there are many sharp gags to enjoy. And of them all, the highlight just may be the famous 'mirror sequence,' which is worth the price of admission all on its own.",10,2,4,3 December 2004

I've seen this kind of thing before, in movies like REAR WINDOW, FRIGHT NIGHT, and others. Worse of all with DISTURBIA, the first half (or more like 3/4) played like an '80s teen comedy flick. We have the voyeur being a troubled teenager who's confined to his home on house arrest and gets hot for the cute girl next door, watching her swimming in her bikini through his binoculars when he's not joking around with his typically goofy sidekick friend. We start getting somewhere with the actual plot later on, and though things do pick up considerably, it's too late by then.

","Not a great film, but a sincere and pretty funny one as we follow the trials of a good natured middle-aged geek named Andy (played by Steve Carell) who has yet to have sex with a woman. He's an introverted loner living by himself whose idea of an exciting weekend is making egg salad and painting his toy models. His buddies at the local electronics shop where they all work are a fun group of typical horny male characters, each around ten years younger than Andy, who try everything possible to break their inexperienced friend in, setting him up with women and passing on some of their own personal strategies for dealing with the opposite sex.Much to this film's credit, it isn't afraid to go over the line with occasional non-PC jokes and ideas in a day and age where everyone is so ultra-sensitive to everything. The cheap toilet humor and sex gags actually work very well amidst all this, aided greatly by a charming performance by Carell in the lead part, who actually makes his character of Andy very likable and almost even manages to make virginity seem cool. It was also refreshing to see an older and more down-to-earth love interest as portrayed by Catherine Keener for a change, instead of the usual 'Beverly Hills 90210' bimbos we're bombarded with all the time.The audience I saw this with in the theater loved every minute and were in hysterics, adding to the fun. I've never seen my wife laugh so hard either; she howled so much, she was coughing and lost her breath! It's become a favorite film of hers and she's bought the 'Unrated' DVD. We watched the extended version with 17 added minutes at home again recently and I recall it being a little better in its shorter theatrical version. But maybe that's just me.

","Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale) works in a dingy machine shop and is ostracized by his co-workers after inadvertently causing a near-fatal accident to one of his fellow employees. Trevor is inflicted with chronic insomnia and hasn't been able to sleep for a whole year, and his mind and body are breaking down as a result of it. He's been steadily losing so much weight that he's dropped to under 120 lbs and appears sickly and undernourished, and everyone around him suspects he's been using drugs. Lately his perception has become so affected by sleep deprivation that he's having a difficult time in telling reality apart from imagination. He starts to develop hallucinations and a paranoid delusion where he begins to believe there may be a plot against him. The only person he can confide in is his steady prostitute (Jennifer Jason Leigh), with whom he has formed a closeness above and beyond their business relationship, and who may or may not be a part of the plan to destroy him. Gradually, Trevor manages to but the pieces of the puzzle together in an unpredictable payoff that makes the whole film worthwhile.Christian Bale is excellent in the part of Trevor, and he really keeps us interested in him. The actor starved himself for the role, losing so much weight that he is an unsightly figure, as his bones protrude through his gaunt body. This is a film that is very involving, but also convoluted at times before its climactic revelation finally puts things into perspective for us. I didn't realize it until after the film was over, but incredibly this film was made in Spain after the filmmakers couldn't get funding in the U.S.!

","I saw this installment originally in the theater, but this is the first time I watched the extended 'Unrated' version. I hear there's also an even longer third version that's a 'Director's Cut', but this is getting confusing. In the third chapter, Jigsaw is literally at death's door, so he has his devoted assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnap a young female surgeon named Lynn to force her to operate on him to save his life. The doctor and her husband Jeff are currently facing a rocky road in their marriage, so Jeff is now simultaneously forced to undergo a series of tests in Jigsaw's maze of horror and death contraptions, with Lynn's own survival hinging on the outcome. Jeff has also been living a life full of anger and bitterness ever since a drunk driver killed his son, and his journey through Jigsaw's torture chamber may hold the key to confronting the man who was responsible. This entry has a few good ideas and boasts some of the most inventive death traps in this series, and we also get to feel some sympathy for Jigsaw and his dedicated apprentice Amanda. A slight drawback may be that - at least with the extended Unrated Edition - there is way too much over-abundance of blood, gore, and guts, to the point where it takes a little away from the effectiveness of the film as a whole, even for a SAW sequel. However, this is a SAW movie after all, and all things considered it's a strong enough entry that should satisfy fans of the series to one extent or another. **1/2 out of ****",6,1,2,28 October 2009

Sorry, I just thought this would be A LOT funnier. I like Ben Stiller, and I thought the odd idea of casting Robert Downey Jr. as a black man would make for some humorous situations. Well, Downey doesn't really play a black man, he's playing a white actor playing a black man, and he doesn't have a lot of funny lines. And Jack Black ... I don't like the guy, period. This was just a pretty average movie all around, it left little impression on me. I would say the only times I got a slight chuckle out of it were during the bits with Stiller playing the fictional retarded character, and even Tom Cruise's guesting bit as a bald ball-buster was more inspired than anything else... though it was obvious that Cruise was 'just playing a part' and didn't really come off as authentic. ** out of ****",5,0,3,13 January 2009

","CASINO ROYALE (2006) was a fresh shot in the arm which had successfully jump-started a rather repetitious old James Bond series. Now here is its direct sequel, QUANTUM OF SOLACE. I have seen the movie twice so far and have come to think it's a little better than I first thought when I had left the theater. At first I thought it was really a poor James Bond film and literally the least of the entire franchise; but going back to it at home recently -- and especially right after re-watching CASINO ROYALE again -- I felt it was more acceptable when viewed right after its predecessor, instead of just as a stand-alone experience.Here, Daniel Craig attempts his second outing as a harder edged and more action-oriented James Bond, still reeling from his experience with Bond girl Vesper from back in CR. For old die-hard Bond fanatics, QUANTUM OF SOLACE may very well be the most 'un-Bondian' installment yet; its action sequences are often frantically shot and haphazardly edited to the point where it's tough to tell what is going on as we're assaulted with too-quick cutting and resulting confusion. (This problem did get easier for me on my second viewing). Bond doesn't seem like he enjoys bedding down with gorgeous women as much anymore, doesn't have a favorite drink, has no need of Q Branch to furnish him with fancy gizmos. With this chapter it's a whole new ballgame. Much as I liked Craig last time, his now patented tough act of being his own man who breaks all the rules and does what he chooses by not giving a damn about what his boss M (Judi Dench) thinks, is getting all too familiar by now. Perhaps when viewed as a direct continuation of CASINO ROYALE, this is understandable. And Dench, whom I used to enjoy as the head commander M, is becoming such a one-trick pony with her tired routine of loathing Bond's disobedient ways one moment, but then actually admiring him the next... this has been going on since the earliest of the Pierce Brosnan films. It's probably time for her to move away from this franchise.This isn't a 'bad' movie, but it's basically just an epilogue to another film. Don't attempt to watch it without having seen CASINO ROYALE first. And preferably right before.**1/2 out of ****",6,2,4,16 November 2008

","(!Spoilers!)I finally got around to dedicating four hours to this celebrated film, and while I had to admire its radiant Techincolor cinematography, strong characterizations and magnificent musical score (thank you, Max Steiner), I could not savor much of the actual movie itself. Therefore, I consider GONE WITH THE WIND way overrated in the rankings of all time 'best' films. While it's very appealing on a technical level, it struck me as an ordinary soap opera dressed in vibrant garnish. It's an ugly, gloomy movie that's all prettied up with fancy decoration. If not for this lavish treatment, this would not be anywhere near as praised as it is today.This is one of the long epics that really feels like it, and the meandering love story could have been told in half the time. The first side of the picture is mostly drawn out exposition, and it isn't really until the second half that WIND kicks into higher gear and finds its stride. As I said from the top, one positive is that all the characterizations are quite potent, and that goes double for Academy-Award winning Vivien Leigh, who succeeded continuously in making me despise her as Scarlett O'Hara, a hateful and abusive witch that makes you wonder why anyone would want to spend these four hours with her, never mind a lifetime (as clueless Rhett Butler so desperately wants to do). Scarlett is so mean and self-centered that I couldn't have cared less what happened to her (and I really wanted something to happen to her). I suppose that's part of the idea - but I can't get four hours of entertainment out of that unless O'Hara is actually Baby Jane or Lizzie Borden. How are we supposed to sympathize with her plight?What does Scarlett see in geeky Ashley Wilkes? More importantly, what does Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) see in HER? Oh, right, I forgot - she's feisty, strong, says what's on her mind, etc. -- but it should have been quite clear to Butler that a marriage with this user could never work. And when they finally do tie the knot (after she's been married twice already to men she cared even less about than Rhett! HELL-LO!) it turns out that Butler finally sees he made a mistake. Well, maybe not -- because one minute he wants a divorce, the next minute he's hoping they can work things out, then it's back to divorce, then a pregnancy lights up his eyes again. Back and forth, back and forth, two and a half hours, three hours -- and finally, like me, he decides he just doesn't give a damn. Well, duh! So Rhett rejects Scarlett. Their little girl dies. Goodbye Ashley Wilkes. Lovable Melly bites the dust too. But at least there's always tomorrow, and Scarlett still has her old land and another chance for Rhett. Ugh. While dramatically well rendered, it's all so sullen for this kind of a movie.I still give GONE WITH THE WIND a rating of **1/2 ('Fair'), because it's certainly at least that - and especially taking into account its great cinematic strengths. When I think of this film, I keep hearing that marvelous, grandiose main title theme, and I keep seeing the beautiful orange sky with Leigh as a silhouette in the night swearing she'll never be hungry again. I see impressive camera shots, like the tracking sweep where Scarlett walks among row after row of fallen war-worn bodies.

","I kept meaning to see this when it was in the theaters because I'd heard so many great things about it. When it was praised at the Academy Awards and even got a Best Picture Oscar, I tried a little harder, but bad scheduling kept interfering. Now that I've seen it (not once, but twice -- more on that later) I've come to think the man upstairs might have been trying to spare me several dollars. First off, with such expectations going in, this will have to rank as one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. My **1/2 rating wouldn't have changed a bit had I never heard of its reputation; it's just that I wouldn't have used the term 'overrated' to describe it.The Bad: I'll skip with the storyline here, but just say that there are some plot holes and bits of business that just never made much sense to me (like having the suitcase transferred through the vents in the different hotel rooms). None of its characters are likable (not that this in itself is a deal breaker if a movie works), the pacing is lethargic and sleep-inducing, and the ending is terrible and inconclusive. Tommy Lee Jones is interesting as an ineffective Texas sheriff who can't deal with the escalating new brand of random violence, yet he's underused. All he does is offer up endless musings about how things have changed, but one wonders why they'd give a badge to such a disinterested lawman. And not only is Jones not interested; does anyone else in this state ever hear or react to all the endless shootings, car explosions and crashes going on everywhere?The Good: nice direction and cinematography, and good performances from Jones, Josh Brolin, and -- of course -- Javier Bardem, who makes one of the screen's most memorable villains with his ominous portrayal of a crazed and indifferent psychopathic killer. That said, do I think Bardem's performance was worthy of the coveted Oscar which he received? No, I wouldn't go quite that far. But as of this time I haven't seen the other best supporting actors' work in the other films they were nominated for along with Bardem.In the end this is just an Above Average chase movie with elements of western, horror, slash-and-stalk, and melodrama. It's well-acted, shot nicely, benefits from not using any music score. But I'm not sure of the point to any of the ugliness that's going on, and some things were incomprehensible, including the unsatisfying conclusion. I actually made sure to watch it two times... first last night where its pacing made my head nod a few times... and then again bright-eyed and bushy-tailed the next morning, just to make sure I gave it a fair chance. My rating stayed the same both times. **1/2 out of ****",6,3,6,27 December 2008

","A good deal of the raves for this film seem to come from the camp of Batmaniacs, and that's perfectly okay and understandable. I've always thought the character of The Batman was cool myself, and I enjoyed Tim Burton's 1989 take on the 'Dark Knight'. What a pity it is that in the aftermath of this new overrated Nolan film, it sure appears that Burton's movie is going to be put out to pasture. Never under-estimate the power of further remakes and re-imaginings to have a potential to dim the lights of an older favorite in the public's eyes. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence but it seems to be happening here.I'm just a casual fan on this subject so I'm afraid that all the praises of how 'this is BATMAN done right!' fail to impress me. Oh, I certainly prefer a more dark tone to the character and I was grateful that Burton's version went back to that deeper angle, but I think BATMAN BEGINS goes too far with the bleak tone at the complete expense of any kind of camp or fantasy at all. Christian Bale comes across initially as a very good man for the job of portraying Bruce Wayne, but after a while his shtick as the costumed Batman becomes a little overdone; it's overly dramatic when he continually roars with authority, or utilizes that deep-throated and unnatural whisper of his. I have nothing against an angry Batman - in fact, that's one of the things I did like about this rehash - but must he always sound so 'put on'? I love Michael Caine and thought he was a natural choice for the new Alfred, but he seemed to be under-used in this film.The much-anticipated fight scenes were ruined. It was impossible to comprehend what was going on in any shot, and the result was like watching one huge, muddy blur. Likewise, the movie's too long (so what else is new?), and the over-abundance of a nonstop barrage of action later in the film is an assault on the senses and comes off as a bore rather than a thrill. When will Hollywood today learn that overdoing mind-numbing action sequences and effects actually have the opposite desired effect? I kind of objected to the horror movie approach to many moments, making me feel that I was watching a demonic possession flick like THE EXORCIST at certain points. Or maybe it's just me.Now, I've come on pretty rough with this movie but it's not unwatchable by any means. I liked the way we get to see some of Wayne's training, which helps us better relate to how he's able to fight crime as strongly as he does. There was nice attention paid to the troubles of Bruce as a boy. Cillian Murphy was a properly despicable baddie. I just would have liked a little more of the tongue-in-cheek gadgetry and eccentric villainy to compliment the tragedy in Bruce Wayne's psyche. This was not the Bat Cave I would have preferred, and the tank in the film is just not the Batmobile for me. Hell, I even missed the bat poles or bat chute. Burton's films had some of this in their mix, while still concentrating on Batman as a complex, disturbed figure. I also much preferred Burton's vision of a Gothic Gotham City as opposed to this more sterile, high-tech approach. **1/2 out of ****",6,1,4,23 June 2005
Twilight," Twilight (2008) **1/2
","Another movie watched to appease my wife, though it wasn't as torturous as it might have been had it not been about vampires and featured Kristen Stewart, who I felt gave a satisfactory performance as Joan Jett in THE RUNAWAYS. This movie was just what I expected ... a teenage romance for the ladies, not bad but not necessarily good either. Stewart plays Bella, a high school student who becomes smitten (if not bitten) by an attractive male classmate named Edward Cullen who happens to be a modern-day vampire. She's drawn to him and quickly falls in love but must face extraordinary challenges when he reveals to her exactly what he is. Does Edward love this human female enough to restrain his urges to feast on her blood? And can Bella be accepted by Edward's offbeat family (who are also non-human vampires, albeit the friendly kind)? Once you abandon any ideas of Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, or traditional vampires who sported fangs and capes in general, this is tolerable for what it sets out to be. Of course, you also must be prepared to accept the idea that Edward's family of bloodsuckers enjoys passing their time by playing baseball together during lightning storms. Kristen is only adequate as Bella, but Robert Pattinson seems well chosen for his part as the alluring Edward. **1/2 out of ****",6,0,2,30 March 2010
Meet the Fockers," Meet the Fockers (2004) **1/2
","Not as good as MEET THE PARENTS, but still a decent sequel with star power going for it if not the most clever gag writing.I enjoyed the first film and yet found myself shifting back and forth during the course of this follow-up; I was chuckling one minute but then shaking my head the next, wondering why too much of the material tended to rely on cheap sex jokes and non-clever toilet humor (I'm no prude but jeez - can anyone write ANYTHING else for a laugh these days?). It also felt as though there were too many obvious references to routines that worked well already in the original, just to let you know the filmmakers didn't forget them.One thing is for certain -- Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were ideally cast as Ben Stiller's parents, The Fockers. That in itself makes this sequel worth the watch. At times it was hard to swallow that any married couple could be so irresponsibly perverse and inconsiderate during such a crucial first meeting with their future in-laws, but then again I suppose that's supposed to provide the whole basis for this film's existence. By the time it's all over, most fans who liked PARENTS should come away from FOCKERS feeling that they've had at least some fun with it. Just how 'much' fun will vary from viewer to viewer, though.",6,3,8,26 December 2004
Seabiscuit," Seabiscuit (2003) **
","An overrated and overlong compilation of fluff about people following their dreams and coming out on top during the despairing days of the Depression. The non-actor Tobey Maguire is ineffective in making us feel anything for his lead character named Red, who is forsaken by his parents and tries to make it in the world by becoming a jockey. Red becomes fond of a lazy and temperamental horse called Seabiscuit, and then works to tame him and turn him into a winning racing stallion. Jeff Bridges fares a little better as a salesman who goes from bicycles to cars to placing stock in Seabiscuit. His second wife is played by Elizabeth Banks, who takes the prize of being the actor who can't convince me she isn't actually from the 21st century (there always seems to be at least one in these things). Chris Cooper plays the always-sunken trainer, whose tired and down trodden persona grates on me after awhile. For such an emotional subject, I found that I was not interested in any of these characters. I place that flaw at the feet of the actors and director Gary Ross.The first 45 minutes or more are haphazardly shot and edited, so it's difficult to keep up with what's transpiring, as many people and situations are flashed about at frantic pace to establish some kind of set-up. I was just hoping a moment would come where we'd settle down and linger with the characters, or at least have one protracted sequence where we could relax and take it in. The sappiness of the story is pounded into our heads through a climactic feel-good score by Randy Newman, inappropriately placed just about everywhere instead of saved for the climax. ** out of ****",5,1,3,27 January 2013
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) ***
","I've been a die-hard fan of the old PLANET OF THE APES franchise since the early '70s, and have been starved for a very long time by wanting this series to start up fresh again and return 'Apemania' to the fold. I had my fingers crossed ten years ago when Tim Burton undertook the 2001 reboot, but it turned out to be an abomination and an insult. I'm pleased to say that RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is much better than Burton's idiotic mess. Some viewers already seem to place RISE as some kind of prologue to the original 1968 Charlton Heston classic, but I prefer to think of it as a separate, unrelated storyline which hopefully will make enough money to inspire a followup and possibly a whole new saga all its own. RISE stars James Franco as a young scientist experimenting with a cure for Alzheimer's, which his dad (John Lithgow) suffers from. He reaches a promising level of success, and when testing the cure on apes, it results in a super-intelligent pet chimpanzee named Caesar (played by Andy Serkis, with CGI enhancement). Caesar demonstrates smarts and a communicative ability, and is loved by Franco, but ultimately is taken from him and mistreated in a caged environment with his fellow simians. Caesar becomes more enraged as he is dealt one indignity after another, and it's no surprise by the film's title to say that he initiates a massive ape revolt.This is basically an enjoyable popcorn film, though it's nowhere near as cerebral as the original five-chapter series was. Andy Serkis does an impressive turn as the lead ape Caesar, in a part only semi-replicating Roddy McDowall's performance in CONQUEST OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. James Franco makes a so-so lead, even if it's sometimes hard to believe he can accomplish such medical wonders. John Lithgow is properly sympathetic as Franco's suffering dad. Freida Pinto is completely forgettable in a very under-written part. Some of the lead apes in this film are played by a few actors enhanced through 'CGI Capture', but otherwise are CGI creations all together. As far as CG technology goes, it's a pretty good job here -- but every now and then I was reminded that I was watching faux images.One thing that was unnecessary to this longtime ApesFan were all the 'wink-wink' references to the old apes movies; nearly everyone in the movie is named after someone associated with the original film ('Franklin,' 'Jacobs', 'Dodge'), and when they revisit a couple of popular classic lines, it made me cringe. (They had re-used one of them even in Burton's movie. Why do they feel compelled to stoop to that?). While nothing great, RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a good enough offering with a welcome chunk of heart. It's not exactly clear what heights Caesar and his friends are hoping to accomplish at the end of the story; with any luck, box office receipts will make that more fleshed out in a sequel. *** out of ****",7,3,15,6 August 2011
Django Unchained," Django Unchained (2012) ***1/2
","I just got back from seeing DJANGO UNCHAINED, and I thought it was Very Good, and one of Quentin Tarantino's best. But what I really enjoyed most were the strong performances and vivid characterizations -- Jamie Foxx as the determined slave Django, but even more so his partner Christoph Waltz, who is exceptional yet again (I loved his good-hearted character Schultz here). I never thought I would ever enjoy Leonardo DiCaprio in anything, but I thought he was remarkably villainous in DJANGO. Samuel Jackson was truly excellent, I thought, the first time we see him in the part of an aged house servant ... but it seemed like his elderly and slow-moving character rejuvenated a little more each time we saw him later (at least this was my initial impression). And a big surprise was a short-lived yet highly entertaining tour de force by Don Johnson!I'd say the movie could have been nearly perfect if not for a feel of lagging and overstaying itself in the last 20 + minutes or so for me. I felt disappointed in the direction things went in the final act(s) or so, pretty much after Waltz and Leonardo finally conclude their transaction. And some of the last bits with Michael Parks again showing up to make the same trademark gestures he's already used in other films like KILL BILL, and Quentin himself (who's starting to appear more like 'Tubby' Tarantino) compromising the proceedings yet again with another self-indulgent and needless cameo, well -- I could have skipped those.Just a word about the 'racism' we've been hearing around some camps (like from the delusional Spike Lee). This movie depicts language and attitudes the way they were in those unfortunate and misguided times, and nobody's saying or doing anything that probably wasn't actually said and done (and worse) back then. But more than that, the Tarantino twist here is that it's the slaves who get to settle the score. The movie is an 'up yours!' to the slave keepers of that period. And sure, there is violence which is some places is overly gratuitous for the story we're involved with. But I think the gore and action is of secondary interest to the real appeal of the film for me: which is the friendship between Django (Jamie Foxx) and Schultz (Waltz), and their dedication to one another. The movie is also humorous in places, but never overly so. ***1/2 out of ****",9,1,5,5 January 2013
The Number 23," The Number 23 (2007) BOMB
","Oh God, what a terrible film! I rented this because I was interested in seeing what funnyman Jim Carrey could do in a straight horror movie, but I shouldn't have bothered. A completely senseless mess, totally illogical and dull as dishwater.Carrey is an animal control worker who gets hold of a book where its unknown author rants on about the symbolism of the number '23' and how it pertains to his life, and as Carrey reads, he begins to recognize himself in the character and starts to freak out and believe the book is about him. It's mind numbing in the repetitive way it goes on and on about all the alleged symbolism for the number '23', which is seemingly anywhere you go if you want to look at it that way, even when the idea is stretched to absurd extremes... Carrey's address, for instance, is 1418 -- so 14+1+8 = 23, right!? Except that 1+4+1+8 = 14 too, and 141+8 = 149 also!! Jeez...

Across the Universe," Across the Universe (2007) ***
","Step back into retro 1968 for a very colorful and wondrous musical trip featuring today's young performers saluting The Beatles through their music. I must give credit to screenwriters Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais, as well as the director Julie Taymor for having more success in producing glowing results, especially when one recalls the disaster that was 1978's SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.This is a loose and meandering story of a young Liverpool artist named Jude (Jim Sturgess) who goes off to search for a father he never known somewhere in the U.S.A. He meets various characters named after certain Beatles songs and befriends them as they all go about their lives together amidst the outrage of the Vietnam war, 'flower power' psychedelia trips, and love.I just watched this myself on DVD last night along with my wife, my sister and her husband, and my 16-year-old nephew and his young girlfriend. Other than the sad fact that the kids first cringed at the sight of the movie being letterboxed and that they wanted it to be 'the Full Screen' (sigh) it went over very well. Except for my 12-year-old niece, however, who kept retreating to her room and is at this point in her life a lost cause who prefers cRap and Britney Spears to good music. Well, I guess she'll see if anyone makes a movie featuring their stuff in 40 years time. I am a die-hard Beatles collector/freak, and yet I have never managed to sit through all of the SGT. PEPPER movie. I must admit that I went into ACROSS THE UNIVERSE with much trepidation, but I came out of it very exhilarated and with the satisfaction of feeling that there might be young teens out there in the modern world who were now made more aware of The Beatles' music where they wouldn't have thought they were cool enough before.It's pretty much a futile exercise to attempt a whole coherent film and any sort of linear plot line when the whole idea of a movie is to tell a story using songs by a music group and characters conspicuously named after classic songs (like Jude, Jo Jo, Prudence, Sadie, Lucy, Max, etc.). There were some curious missed opportunities -- I kept wondering what the point was of having a character named Maxwell who was angry at his parents and was seen wielding a silver hammer, if not to use the song? Same thing with Sadie (who I wrongly presumed was going to be serenaded for being 'sexy' and for 'making a fool of everyone') and Jo-Jo was never told to 'Get Back'!But with ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, whatever must be found lacking in story is much more than made up for with creative cinematography and some great music at every other turn. I liked just about all of the new renditions of the classic old tunes and it was actually invigorating to hear them freshly sung by new (and some old) faces. I found myself eagerly anticipating what the next chestnut to be attempted was going to be and who would get to sing it. The vocalist who really hit me especially was the character Sadie's (Dana Fuch's) Janis Joplinesque rocking on songs like 'Why Don't We Do It In The Road' and 'Oh, Darling!' (even though the latter was sometimes hindered by the interruptions of Martin Luther McCoy). A couple of weak singing moments that stood out for me were the embarrassingly silly 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite', by Eddie Izzard, as well as leading boy Jim Sturgess' softcore blabbering for 'Revolution'. Still, even these didn't hurt the movie as a whole. Oh, I might nitpick that a seasoned Beatles devotee like U2's Bono ought to be aware that the sounds which are barked in the classic 'I Am the Walrus' are not the commonly misheard 'Koo Koo Kachoo', but rather 'Goo Goo G'joob', but this is desperate criticism. It was great to see him perform this psychedelic tune, and ditto for Joe Cocker croaking out the opening lines of 'Come Together'.The memory of The Beatles is alive and well and made fresher than ever for a new youthful audience thanks to ACROSS THE UNIVERSE. *** out of ****",7,0,1,17 February 2008
I Am Legend," I Am Legend (2007) **1/2
","I'm a huge fan of the two earlier film versions of this story - certainly of THE OMEGA MAN and, to a lesser extent, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. Being a sucker for most end-of-the-world science fiction movies in general, I was game enough to see what could be done at this late date for Richard Matheson's classic 1954 novel I AM LEGEND. To start off with, I'm relieved that this third adaption has its own title to keep it separate from the other two. After all, in this day of remakes run amuck, we need to be thankful for small favors.If this had been several years ago I would surely have moaned even at the thought of Will Smith taking on this lead role; but fortunately he has proved himself a pretty decent actor and movie hero in recent times. Here he takes the crucial role of Robert Neville, a scientist left alive in New York City after the rest of the world has died off from the effects of a wonder drug which promised to cure cancer but actually wound up rendering mankind virtually extinct. Neville spends his days searching out other possible survivors along with his lovable canine companion, a faithful German shepherd named Sam (short for Samantha). At night he must bolt his doors to seal himself off from a mob of rabid Computer Simulated maniacs who are what now remains of his past civilization.On the positive side, I thought Will Smith was VERY good, and there were some gripping emotional moments from him. He was quite believable as the last desperate man left alive on Earth, and the touching moments spent along with his lone friend Sam are very strong. The chilling effect of a desolate New York City left in turmoil was nicely realized. On the negative side, the film comes crashing down like lead every time we are subjected to the fake-looking hairless night monsters on the prowl who are 'the infected'. Tragically, we are subjected to that awful and overused modern day trend of needlessly depending on CGI renderings instead of using real actors. Why is it considered necessary to have these cartoon-like ravenous creatures zipping and zooming and ricocheting all about at lightning speed, loudly roaring with their extra-wide mouthes agape a la Stephen Sommers' THE MUMMY? This is a damn shame because it completely trashed what was otherwise shaping up to be a fine film indeed. Also missing from this movie is a strong sense of motivation, something which both THE LAST MAN ON EARTH and THE OMEGA MAN each had. There is no interaction with the crazed mutations, for example; they seem to exist here solely because it's what's expected in the story, and not for any solid plot point.If you've either already seen the past two incarnations of Matheson's book, or been into horror and science fiction movies for any length of time, or at least have seen either the 2004 DAWN OF THE DEAD remake or 28 DAYS LATER, you're bound to feel that I AM LEGEND gives you a sense of aimless deja vu. **1/2 out of ****",6,4,7,16 December 2007
Amadeus," Amadeus (1984) *
","To be blunt, I found AMADEUS to be one of the most Overrated and preposterous bores in all of motion picture history, and that goes back a long way now. It's not very often that I'm this clueless as to the almost universal appeal of a certain highly revered work of cinematic art, but I just couldn't help wondering just what was supposed to be so damned compelling about this very, very lengthy and dramatically vacant exercise in tedium?For openers, I just couldn't buy Tom (NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE) Hulce as 'the' Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the very moment he first came on screen, groping after an equally miscast Elizabeth Berridge as his fiancée-wife, I knew I was in for a very rough ride; here I was only 20 minutes into this thing and already the leading lovers were utterly irritating ... and with 140 minutes left to go!Hulce looks like what he is - a 20th Century guy in a 1700's period white wig - and though she's actually over the age of 20, Berridge hardly appears old enough to play anything but his kid sister. Somebody should have told these two to lose their modern accents; Berridge loves to say 'gonna' ('I'm not gonna marry you') and she tells someone that 'only an idiot would ask Wolfie to work on that 'stuff''. Oh well. All the same, I'd imagine that speaking in a proper 1700's dialect would have sounded even more out of date while delivering such silly dialog as this:MOZART: 'Here, everything goes backwards. People walk backwards and dance backwards and sing backwards and even talk backwards.GIRL: 'That's stupid'.MOZART: 'Why? People fart backwards...' How idiotic. But this is not limited only to these two bozos; even another character uses the modern expression: 'if you marry him you won't have a pot to p*ss in'. It also seems like the phrase 'kiss my ass' was very popular back in the days of Mr. Wolfie, too.Enough about the dialog. There is still one glimmer of hope in all this mess - and that's F. Murray Abraham (who won the Best Actor Oscar) as Antonio Salieri. What very little there is to admire in this movie is solely owed to his interesting performance, and in the character himself. Maestro Salieri's overwhelming envy of his childish colleague's superior talents, and the gradual resentment he feels toward God for leaving him in the dust of mediocrity, is the only saving grace keeping the film from total ruin. It's a pity that this angle of the story was historical fiction, though.And then there was that giggle... that ever-present, idiotic giggle...* out of ****",2,28,66,3 January 2005
Gran Torino," Gran Torino (2008) ***
","Senior citizen Clint Eastwood portrays Walt Kowalski, a tough, old fashioned, angry, racist Korean War Vet who has just lost his wife of many years and is now going it alone in his home. The neighborhood has changed over the years and its citizens are now mainly Asians or black people, who Walt has nothing but disdain for, using each and every prejudicial slur in the book (and many others I don't think I've ever heard) as part of his regular hateful vocabulary. He even wants no part of his kindly Hmong next door neighbors until he encounters the young teenage brother and sister, who begin to make a slight dent in his cynical armor. Kowalski is eventually faced with a turn of events which will ultimately determine what he's made of at this late stage in his life.If this is to be Clint Eastwood's last film, it would be a case of his going out on a high note. At first I didn't know what to make out of Eastwood's over the top racial rantings ... they were so exaggerated and cartoonish that he was coming off as satirical. There are a lot of funny lines in the film in spite of this, and it's a relief that the script winds up making us care about Walt in contrast to his ways, which believe it or not actually begin to make him endearing as the story progresses (you have to see for yourself). If I am going to get picky, the acting wasn't the greatest. At times I thought even Clint's delivery seemed a bit false, or that he was pausing while delivering some of lines, or something. But this is a touching movie about people, heart, and responsibility. I liked it. *** out of ****",7,0,4,19 January 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) **
","SPOILERS- I didn't really need or want to see this, but I had a few hours to kill one afternoon and this was the most accessible movie at the theater. It's not that I don't appreciate Spidey; I grew up a fan of Marvel and Spider-Man, and I had seen the first three Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films already. When Andrew Garfield played the part again in yet another needless reboot called THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN two years ago, I refused to bother, so soon after Sam Raimi had already done a new series. I found that as much as I don't think much of Tobey, I thought he still had made a better Peter Parker than Garfield.Let's get down to business. So this Part 2 of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN was about what I expected, no less -- but also, unfortunately, nothing more. Typically overdone special effects... a movie that feels way too long, with too many climaxes... and also trying to cram in too many bad villains for one movie (so what else is new in Superhero Cinema?). To begin, Jamie Foxx is ridiculous as a sniveling Max Dillon, who turns into 'Electro'. I couldn't believe we had to sit through yet ANOTHER take on 'The Green Goblin' (Dane DeHaan)... come on, with all the classic Spidey villains over the decades, must you rely on a character we've already seen in the last recent series? And the final joke of all was a completely out-of-place tacked-on climax with Paul Giamatti as a thug in an over-sized mechanical robot contraption, who is allegedly supposed to be 'The Rhino' (I remember The Rhino from the comics -- and this metallic monstrosity looked more like J. Jonah Jameson's 'Spidey Slayer', or the one that Thunderbolt Ross manipulated to thwart The Incredible Hulk!). And speaking of J. Jonah Jameson... where the hell was he in this picture, anyway? He was a vital part of Spider-Man. Was he in the first movie? Not that I'm going to see it.Sally Field is a terrific actress, and she tries hard in this movie as Peter's old Aunt May. The only problem is, she doesn't really look or feel anything like the real Aunt May from the comics, and -- I hope Sally will appreciate this -- she's not old-looking enough. Or maybe I'm just still used to seeing that sweet and chubby little face as GIDGET or THE FLYING NUN.Emma Stone was okay, I guess. Nothing that stood out, certainly, in her performance as Gwen Stacy. The one kudo I'll give to the film (can we still call these things 'films' nowadays, or are they now 'digitals'?) is that I was crossing my fingers that Gwen would meet her death like she did from the comics, and I'm glad the movie did not waffle there; however, her death scene was so over-staged and sensationalized: falling, falling, falling, falling...still falling! ... amidst slow-motion, in mid-air drama...with cartoon debris effects littered and flying all about the air...

Million Dollar Baby," $500,000 Cliché **
","(Spoilers Galore):Here it is in a nutshell, so don't read if you haven't seen the movie or if you don't want the whole thing revealed to you: Clint Eastwood is a crusty old fight manager whose latest client decides to bail out on him, so when a feisty and determined girly boxer named Maggie (Hillary Swank) shows up at his gym and begs him to train her, he eventually agrees after first putting her off. The girl becomes a really good fighter, knocking all the competition out in the first round, but ultimately meets her match in a dirty-fighting opponent who breaks her neck in the ring and sentences her to a fate at the hospital, where she loses her will to live.Here we have another one of those non-deserving Best Picture Winners. Let's not get carried away here -- the film is 'pretty good' at best, and certainly watchable, but this is nothing more than a retread of so many other boxing and heart-tugging tearjerkers that I'm surprised so many embraced it. All I can guess is that a lot of people never saw the ROCKY films, LOVE STORY or TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. This is a familiar old tale: 'Struggling boxer wants to be managed by the best, and an aging old trainer wants one more shot so he hesitantly accepts the challenge. And then, toss in a heaping helping of sudden tragedy from other tearjerkers which causes everyone to pull out their handkerchiefs and Kleenex'. The End.The assets of the film come from the performances of Eastwood, Swank, and also the dependable Morgan Freeman, along with heart and soul and a collection of characters that really relate to one another well. Clint's trainer in particular is given a complex nature, as he goes to church every day to talk to his priest and is haunted by the mistakes he feels he's made during his years. But Swank's Maggie turns out to be a real phony in the end, as she decides that life without one of her limbs is no longer worth living. I don't have a problem with that decision in and of itself, but up to this point we've been hit over the head again and again that Maggie is one tough cookie who never says 'no' and doesn't stop fighting. I didn't buy for a minute that she'd give up the real fight of her life when the going really got tough.",6,0,1,19 July 2005

Paranormal Activity," Paranormal Activity (2007) ***
","A young woman who's shacked up with her boyfriend in his house has finally revealed to him that she's been stalked by a ghost or demon ever since she was eight years old. Her heroic partner decides to keep a video camera running all day and evening in case they can catch evidence of things that go 'bump' in the night. I saw this last night with my wife and two friends. Our theatre was packed with a full house and everyone was getting into it, and I have to say that I got freaked out and felt fear and dread several times during this movie - and I'm someone who never really gets 'scared' when watching horror films, and I personally do not even believe in the existence of ghosts or demons. There isn't anything in the way of story or plot here, but that's not the point ... the goal is to scare you, and the film certainly made good on that goal. Much like JAWS made me afraid to go into the water in 1975, this film often made me dread going to bed at night as a grown man. There is also some comic relief with the couple's squabbling, mostly courtesy of the wise-cracking boyfriend who means well but sometimes doesn't take his girlfriend seriously.I think it's much to this movie's credit that the simplest means of scare tactics are the very best, and this low, low-budgeted film - with no blow-away makeup or CGI effects, no dazzling camera work (the scariest parts come with the camcorder completely still in one frame at night), and only a cast of two or three people, can be more effective than the most action-packed multi-million dollar blockbusters. You have to know HOW to make a subtle scary film where less is more, and this certainly accomplished that. It is a complete slap in the face to bloated Hollywood that an amateur project like this can trump all 'traditional' horror movies of the last couple of decades when it comes to producing scares. I thought I was getting tired of the 'shot on home video' genre after THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and CLOVERFIELD (both good films, I thought) but I'm wondering if the success of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY will keep revitalizing this approach. The technique is very strong in capturing the 'reality' feel of a horrific situation. *** out of ****",7,1,3,12 October 2009
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) **
","I have often said that Johnny Depp is a fine actor - one of the best today, actually. But his eerie interpretation of Willy Wonka made me uneasy, repulsed, and - had I been a small child - I'd imagine also pretty frightened as well. As some commentators have said, this is not a movie for little kids. For an intended wondrous, child-like fantasy of this type, where an eccentric larger-than-life candy maker invites five lucky golden ticket-winning children to visit his marvelous factory for one whole day, there were far too many horrific sights and a generally dark, gloomy weirdness to these proceedings. Totally joyless, they even made 'me' feel repelled rather than delighted.I went to the movie because I like Depp, and I'm a long-time fan of Christopher Lee (who plays Wonka's dentist daddy in flashback sequences). I also have a cheerful wife whose favorite childhood film of all time was the old Gene Wilder version of WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and, to tell you the truth - she's like a little kid herself whenever she thinks of this story. So I wanted to go to this new Tim Burton movie partly because I knew I'd be tickled to see her so happy, as I anticipated she might be - and for what it's worth, she did come out liking this film as much as the older one, sure enough. At least THAT was some kind of solace for me.Right after seeing Burton's take on Charlie, I dug out my wife's copy of the 1971 Gene Wilder film. I watched it and have come to the conclusion that this new version is obviously done on more of a grand scale, and there were elements of it that worked better than before; but at the same time, the original had more charm and less grimness. Some of the changes I liked better would be: I think the boy playing Charlie is more sincere and pitiable in this 2005 edition, but the neighborhood that Burton has him living in looks like something out of Gotham City from his own BATMAN ('89). I know Charlie and his family are supposed to be impoverished, but their crooked little shack that looks like it's ready to collapse any second is taking it a bit too far. I also liked the new addition of the 'competitive' girl and her striving mom who seem to have their eye on the 'prize' as some sort of fierce competition instead of just trying to have a good old fun time. I liked most of the songs heard in the 1971 version better than the musical numbers in this one, and while the old feature could be pretty mean at times in its own right, it's child's play next to Burton's horrors, and Wilder still made for a more acceptable choice as the unusual candy showman than Depp does. If I were a child, I wouldn't want to be anywhere near Johnny's Willy. For those insisting that Burton's film is true to the Roald Dahl book, I haven't read it, so I don't know. But word on the street from those who have read it say that CHARLIE is not 100% faithful either. But get this -- while watching the 1971 movie, however, I was surprised to learn that the screenplay was written by Mr. Dahl himself -- so, whether completely in tune with the novel or not, I'm taking the Gene Wilder film to be straight from the original author's mouth (and pen). It had his seal of approval. ** out of ****",5,6,14,15 July 2005
Black Snake Moan," Black Snake Moan (2006) **1/2
","I rented this expecting some sort of sleazy sexploitation craziness from straight out of the late 60s or early 70s, but that turned out to be false advertising. All the same, I mostly came away with an appreciation for what turned out to be a pretty good drama by the time it was all over. Samuel L. Jackson was very good as an old former blues musician and now truck driving farmer named Lazarus, whose wife leaves him for a more exciting life. One day he finds a young woman (Christina Ricci) beaten up and lying in the road and he takes her back to his shack to try and nurse her back to health. The girl is a local nymphomaniac with an uncontrollable need for sex, and who's slept with just about every man who crosses her path. Lazarus believes he can help 'cast the devil from her' and find his own salvation through his deeds. At first it's difficult to care much for this callous and bitchy slut, but as the film progresses we learn the root of her troubles and, partly due to Ricci's good performance, we become invested in her character and even begin to sympathize somewhat. Justin Timberlake, I almost hate to say, is decent in this as Ricci's spineless and anxiety-suffering boyfriend, who goes off to the military but is sent back due to his nervous condition. The movie also offers some fairly good music here as well. While watching the deleted scenes on the DVD later on, I felt that many of them would have benefited this film, and director Craig Brewer might have done better to leave them intact. He would have had a much better movie. **1/2 out of ****",6,1,2,21 July 2007
The Dark Knight," The Dark Knight (2008) **1/2
","This followup to BATMAN BEGINS has only been out for a short time, and already it's getting hailed as 'The Greatest Movie Of All Time' by many viewers of all walks of life, presently enjoying an unfathomable general rating of 9.4 out of a possible 10 points on the 'Internet Movie Database'. As a result, the voting has it currently ranking as #1 on their 'Top 250 Movies' list, even taking reign above true cinematic classics like CITIZEN KANE, BEN-HUR, THE GODFATHER and CASABLANCA. If this trend keeps up, we'll have a #1 for THE DARK KNIGHT, all right -- as the #1 'Most OVERRATED Movie Of All Time'!Hey, folks -- please let's get a grip. One has to wonder how much of this unprecedented glory has to do with the tragic death of 29-year-old Heath Ledger (who plays the Joker in this movie), who passed on unexpectedly with a drug overdose just months before this film was released. THE DARK KNIGHT is not a good film, but it's not as much of a miss as BATMAN BEGINS was. The best thing I will say about THE DARK KNIGHT is that Heath Ledger's contagious interpretation of The Joker IS spellbinding, I will happily concede. Every time this character is on screen we cannot take our eyes off him. His Joker is a ghoulish clown ... intense, deadly, maniacal, and - for the first time that I can remember - downright frightening. He is a criminal to be reckoned with. For devotees of the previous screen versions of The Joker, they may like to know that Ledger also retains some of the comic prowess of this infamous court jester, laughing and getting flamboyant every now and then. I would go as far to say that Ledger is reason alone to see this movie, even though very little else in it can add anything to the fancy table he sets. This is another 'dark' Batman experience. It's not the 'Zap! Bam! Pow!' type of lighthearted comical approach which was dominant in the Adam West television series. From my own personal experiences in talking to different fans of both the 'dark' and the 'light' Caped Crusader, there seems to be two divided camps. I can't concern myself too much with that, though, because for me I approve of both interpretations of the Batman mythos.Christian Bale is The Batman once again, and I had the same trouble with him here that I had with him in BATMAN BEGINS. That being, he tends to growl and speak in a sardonic whisper when wearing his Bat mask, and I think the effect is not only silly, but it grates on my nerves. He looks fine as Bruce Wayne, I suppose, but as Batman he also seems to be unimportant in his own film. While we keep looking forward to the next appearance of The Joker, Batman here is not very prominent.A couple more more sweeteners to the stew are the characters of Harvey Dent (aka Two-Face), well-played by Aaron Eckhart, and Gary Oldman in a good performance as Commissioner Gordon. They're strong and intriguing presences within the movie, also peaking the interest more than Batman himself. Where the movie falls apart for me is that it has a confusing way of telling its story and conveying its action scenes, often coming across like a convoluted mess. It also feels far too long and in dire need of losing 30 or more minutes,easily. Add this to the insipid semi-presence of Batman, and even the factor that Heath Ledger -- for all his ingratiating magnetism in the first half of the film -- also seems to get tired in the last half, and you have just an Above Average film experience. That doesn't make THE DARK KNIGHT even 'good', let alone 'The Greatest Movie Ever Made'. **1/2 out of ****",6,6,12,30 July 2008
Annie Hall," Annie Hall (1977) ***1/2
","Woody Allen's Oscar-winning film which at the time was extremely thought-provoking and took him from just making funny movies into becoming hailed as something of a cinematic auteur with something to say. It's a very funny interplay between a neurotic and pessimistic stand-up Jewish comic named Alvy Singer (Allen, naturally) and his equally screwed up girlfriend Annie (Diane Keaton). These two eccentrics seem made for each other, and through a series of consistently well-written humorous dialogue and New York situations, we watch their relationship begin and fizzle out. I'm not sure there's as much of a point about the nature of relationships here as some reviewers make out, but what works is simply Woody's cynical character and the unrelenting humor. Some of ANNIE HALL's effectiveness may be reduced these days, since after its success and Woody's Oscar, he began repeating himself with future films and so there's a good chance you've already seen Annie and Alvy in other later Woody Allen movies by now. But for its time, this was quite an innovation. I wouldn't consider the movie worthy of its Best Picture award though; I would have given that honor to THE GOODBYE GIRL. A slight demerit is also added because I don't feel the character of Annie Hall herself is very likable or even interesting; it makes one wonder why she was significant enough to have the movie named after her. ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,15 June 2011
Taken," Taken (2008) **
","Liam Neeson plays a retired CIA agent whose former career has made him all paranoid, especially when it comes to worrying about his 17-year-old daughter's well being. When daddy's little girl asks him to sign a consent form so she may travel to Paris with her scatterbrained girlfriend (they actually are lying and want to follow a rock band all around the map), it's with grave reservations that he eventually complies. Once the girls arrive at their destination, it's only mere minutes before dad's worst fears are confirmed, and they're 'taken' by foreign bad guys, to be drugged and sold as sex slaves. It's theorized that Neeson has only 96 hours to find and rescue his daughter before she becomes completely untraceable. As a fan of James Bond, I understand that many spy and action movies require accepting a lot of things that just aren't realistic. That's the fun of these types of films. But the contrived ease and lightning speed with which Neeson is able to arrive at the precise locations and track down and identify the specific criminals here, just struck me as totally unbelievable and cliché. Liam's fun to watch, and he's got some pretty cool lines ready for his daughter's captors, but in addition to the by-the-numbers approach to the material, there's a lot of hand-held and shaky camera craziness to distract those viewers who dislike such an approach. Go watch HARDCORE (1979) with George C. Scott instead. ** out of ****",5,0,0,10 January 2010
Grindhouse," Grindhouse (2007) **1/2
","Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez here have paid homage to their favorite old 'B' films of the 1970s with this inspired package, which essentially comprises two feature films - one from Tarantino, one from Rodriguez - that are in the same fun spirit of Saturday afternoon matinée shows that used to play in theaters back in the day. Back then, you got to see two exploitive movies for the price of one, and these were accompanied by off the wall trailers for other weird movies and they would be premiered before the first flick and then later before the second film began. So basically I am rating this as a whole presentation containing everything including the kitchen sink. If I were to rate the two films individually, I'd say that both were a little disappointing for me (**1/2 each) from what I would have expected, but that Quentin Tarantino's movie is a hair better.Both directors did a fine job of achieving the feel of an old-time grindhouse double feature, complete with adding dirt and scratches to the film prints and other visual imperfections; this also includes apologies for reels that are 'missing', broken sprockets, and even a film burn. The very amusing and vintage-looking faux trailers which are sprinkled around for would-be movies include fun titles like: 'DON'T' (my favorite), 'THANKSGIVING', 'WEREWOLF WOMEN OF THE S.S.', and 'MACHETE'.PLANET TERROR (**1/2) is the first proper movie that unspools, and it's Robert Rodriguez's gory zombie film about a little Texas town which is overrun by disease due to a chemical outbreak. This results in munching ghouls running around attacking people in a spirited and bloody splatterfest, but the problem for me was that none of it struck me as anything very new, and I felt I'd already seen this type of wham-bam-shoot-em-up thing plenty of times before. So then the problem became that after some time I grew tired of this routine and grew restless, wishing the film would end already and that I could see the Tarantino feature start (which is not the feeling a film like PLANET TERROR should give you). It's certainly a better-than-usual zombiefest, but I don't need to see this one again. Oh, I probably will experience it again somewhere in my future, but it'll probably be in someone else's repetitious zombie movie. I didn't have any interest in a single character in PLANET TERROR and that didn't help me care about what was going on very much. The one ingredient I enjoyed was Rose McGowan as a go go dancer who loses a leg and has it replaced with a machine gun; seeing her determined and hobbling about on one false gun leg before lifting it up in order to angrily spray her enemies with gunfire was a kick! Another thing -- way too much dependency on modern CGI stuff for what's supposed to be a 'grindhouse film'. At least it was better than George Romero's recent LAND OF THE DEAD.Quentin Tarantino proves the better director with his DEATH PROOF (**1/2), but it's still not among what I'd call his 'greatest' works. I thought his choice of Kurt Russell in this picture (after he originally wanted Mickey Rourke) worked out wonderfully. Russell plays a has-been stunt driver from past TV days who calls himself 'Stuntman Mike', and he drives an old car that has been souped up to sustain all types of abuse and is virtually 'death proof'. He hangs around the bars to try and schmooze with young girls, but once he gets them into his deadly car for a ride, that's when his dark and psychopathic tendencies erupt. It was a lot of fun to see Russell in this part which he seemed perfectly suited for. He's terrific in the movie and it's an asset to have him in it. Again I liked Tarantino's choice of music for his feature and his slow pacing at least works to give the first grisly sequence of the film a very powerful impact. As a Tarantino fan I always look forward to his clever dialogue, but I have to say he came up empty in that department this time; I wouldn't call the uninteresting conversations here between his female characters anywhere near his best, and these talking scenes do at times feel like they go on waayyyyyy too long. On top of this, the female characters aren't very intriguing and sometimes one or two of them can even be downright annoying. While Quentin's taste in music has always been damn good, it's just hard for me to believe that these young girls would ever be as into these outdated oldies to the extent of knowing the words to 'Baby It's You' or eagerly quoting the names of 'Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Titch'! This just smacks of Tarantino's own self-indulgence, and doesn't seem genuine coming from today's youth. Without adding spoilers here I have to say that I felt some nagging loose ends were left dangling after Quentin's movie was over, and it ended too abruptly without closure, for me.I'm already hearing that there may be longer versions of both movies released in the future, and that the two films may be released individually in some markets. That sort of kills the point, but in the case of longer cuts I think PLANET TERROR already feels plenty long enough, but maybe it might actually be improved with more material and perhaps more questions answered. **1/2 out of ****",7,0,2,15 April 2007

","The one that started it all! I'll never forget how impressed I was with the novel concept of this horror film when I first discovered it via a risky DVD rental: a man dying of cancer decides to play elaborate games of potential death on people who foolishly do not appreciate the value of life and take their health for granted. In this opener of what was destined to become a hugely popular franchise, two young men awake inside an unknown dilapidated building, each one helplessly chained, and find themselves the targets in a crazy game of survival by the unique serial killer nicknamed 'Jigsaw'. Danny Glover (LETHAL WEAPON) co-stars as the detective following the case. Despite the gruesome nature, and thumbing my nose at those viewers too sensitive to watch such a film and realize it's only a movie, this is one of the freshest horror movies to come along in the 21st century, exceptionally written and executed by the young team of Leigh Whannell (who plays one of the doomed prisoners) and James Wan (who directed). ***1/2 out of ****",9,1,3,26 October 2009

","A group of kids from Ohio in 1979 are making a Super 8mm zombie movie when they witness a massive train wreck. They soon realize that the circumstances surrounding it are supernatural in nature. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that I enjoyed this science fiction thriller which functions much like an old 1950s monster movie. The film takes awhile before clicking together and making sense, and when it does it's a very rewarding ride. I appreciated that even though it utilizes heavy CG effects, these did not overpower the story. The characters are well-written, and we're able to invest some emotion in them. Even though the story depicts a savage and deadly giant monster (sort of echoing CLOVERFIELD), somehow we are able to feel sorry for it and sympathize with his goal as revealed later in the movie. Young actress Elle Fanning is the sister of Dakota Fanning (who I enjoyed in HIDE AND SEEK and WAR OF THE WORLDS), and it's plain to see that acting talent runs in their family. There didn't seem to be any real need to make the incidents occur in the retro period of the 1970s or to have them engulf a group of children filming their own home movie project, but as a fan of monster flicks and the '70s myself, this was an extra bonus for me to treasure. *** out of ****",7,1,5,13 June 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Reservoir Dogs (1992) **1/2
","This is Quentin Tarantino's first movie -- a really down and dirty, realistic affair about gangsters and what can occur when they screw up a jewel heist. It starts out great (I liked those early diner discussions about tipping and the point behind Madonna's 'Like A Virgin'), and the torture sequence featuring Michael Madsen is disturbing and very effective. But there isn't much of a plot to all of the goings on, and the bulk of this picture consists of a lot of aimless cursing and yelling. I tend to think of the excellent PULP FICTION when discussing Quentin's other movies, as that was the first of his films I'd seen, and I fell in love with it...a real work of art, that movie. So after going back and discovering DOGS, it becomes apparent that Tarantino rehashed some of this for FICTION. Maybe 'fine tuned' a few things. This is evident with moments like the aforementioned discussion and philosophies in the diner. And Tarantino's obviously fond of working with the same actors again and again.RESERVOIR DOGS is an occasionally interesting yet pointless start for the video clerk geek turned director, but he was to really improve and hone his craft with future movies like PULP FICTION and KILL BILL. **1/2 out of ****",6,1,3,3 July 2004
Love & Mercy," Love & Mercy (2014) ***
","Though not many will be able to tell by the title, this is a bio film on Brian Wilson, the genius behind The Beach Boys. The feature is well designed by going back and forth from the 'young Brian' of the 1960's (Paul Dano) and the 'middle-aged Brian' of the 1980's (John Cusack). In the '60s we witness 20-something pop star Wilson starting to develop anxiety disorders and mental psychosis, and he has to deal with an overbearing and abusive father ... yet he is still compelled to take the old surfing sounds of the earlier Beach Boys to a higher level. Inspired by The Beatles' RUBBER SOUL album, Brian delves into more experimental territory and spearheads the unusual PET SOUNDS project which is now thought to be one of most classic and influential albums ever made. When jumping into the '80s we encounter Brian as a frail and troubled shell of a man, and under the unscrupulous control of Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), who humiliates and dominates him. But Wilson is headed for a road to recovery when he meets Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) who takes an interest in him and sees Dr. Landy for what he really is.A good film overall, this really succeeds due to the effective performances. Though I liked Dano and Cusack as the young and old Brian (even if Cusack doesn't quite look like Wilson), it was Paul Giamatti's turn as the opportunistic 'Dr. Feelgood' which stood out best. The only flaw I found was that I felt perhaps the movie could have done better in showing us just how talented the young Brian was, and how he was able to accomplish so much. As it appears in the story, Brian is so screwed up that it becomes hard to conceive how this individual managed to achieve what he did. I think we needed more of the 'creative genius' Wilson in addition to the 'troubled' Wilson. *** out of ****",7,2,4,10 July 2015

","I'll never understand why so many people are down on M. Night Shyamalan, who I like to call my Savior of Modern Horror. I've only seen SIGNS, THE SIXTH SENSE (both exceptional) and THE VILLAGE (decent enough) but I love the way the man relies on tension and fear, trying to make you think a bit when telling a story, without blowing it up into mind-numbing action and special effects overkill. I am especially surprised when it's purists like me, who usually prefer the older styles of the genre and science fiction stories of the Twilight Zone variety, who are first in line to pounce. I just don't get that. The man is good at what he does (though I admittedly have yet to see LADY IN THE WATER, and I have trepidations reserved for when I do get to it).In this terrifying story written by Shyamalan, a strange and unknown source is causing citizens of cities and small towns in the Northeast to begin rambling incoherently and then seeking to commit suicide, by any gruesome means readily available to them. Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are a married couple swept up in the nightmare, who join up with strangers bonded together in their mad dash to try and vacate the infected areas, though the deadly plague keeps surrounding them. Is it terrorism? Something in the water? The wind? Nature gone berserk?This is a scary concept that works, though I'm a sucker for desperate end-of-the-world movies of this type which leave us no sure-footed understanding or way to escape the horror. The only things I could find mildly lacking here was that Wahlberg isn't a great actor, and he wouldn't be my prime choice for a film like this. Zooey Deschanel leaves something to be desired as well, but the events that are going on around these two are suspenseful, intriguing and frightening enough that it doesn't interfere with the intense experience. Some of the kill scenes are properly disturbing, and I liked the ominous music score. There are a few silly lines now and then ('cheese and crackers!'), but this is a quibble. I very much enjoyed Betty Buckley's eccentric old lady character, and she was also an asset to the film. John Leguizamo touched a nerve in his part as a loving father/husband, and good friend of Wahlberg's.M. Night is a master horror/sci-fi filmmaker, and we need more of him and his work, especially in this present day and age of mindless cookie cutter genre films that rely on an over-abundance of CGI and chess piece characters. I am completely baffled as to why there's such an outcry against his movies after THE SIXTH SENSE. ***1/2 out of ****",9,11,22,12 January 2009
Mystic River," Mystic River (2003) ***
","MYSTIC RIVER is one of those movies that perplexes me as far as how I'd approach commenting on it. The intriguing story grabbed my attention and rarely left my mind wandering off. While it's a well-crafted piece of work and features terrific performances from everyone in the cast (with Tim Robbins being the standout, followed by the always effective Sean Penn), it wasn't without its flaws. All things considered, I'd rate it as a good film, but not an excellent one. It's got a thick feeling of depression and drab misery to it which permeates, and while this is something I'd call a virtue to this particular story I'd also have to say it lingers too long. At something around 138 minutes in length, it's one of those pictures which may have benefited from a shorter running time.I also had a bit of trouble with the outcome of the movie, unfortunately. In particular, the Sean Penn character's lack of any real redemption, comeuppance or anything, really, after he learns what he did. It's not that I didn't 'believe' the character could be so callous or indifferent, but that it didn't prove rewarding to me and ruined what might have been a great film.

","An acclaimed holiday classic which took a very dramatic turn for me this last Christmas season and has finally emerged as a truly emotional and uplifting film in my eyes. To be fair, I had to ask myself if this was the same film I had tried out for only the first time three years ago and which I initially felt was vastly overrated. Back then I was expecting a completely 'Christmas-y' movie and had been disappointed while missing the whole point of the story. So I satisfied my urge to give this acclaimed film a second chance and it was a completely different experience for me. Jimmy Stewart was great in the role of George Bailey, a man who gives of himself to others and puts people ahead, often at his own expense. I found Bailey to be not only tragic at times but funny too. I appreciated a lot of chuckles that I somehow missed originally. I also relished the photography and atmosphere (this being a better quality DVD than the first time I saw it).But I think I was simply in a better frame of mind and mood this time as well, which goes to prove yet again how sometimes movies can really affect you differently at any given time, depending on whatever state you're in when you're watching them or what your expectations are. I also have to say this film touched me greatly emotionally because I just think I can personally relate to a lot of feelings in the film more today than I did yesterday. It touched a spot in me, and I spent the last entire Christmas Season feeling better about the holidays and in more of a generous Christmas spirit than I'd ever felt before. I think I've also learned a little something about life and how to better live it from this classic this time out and it was a fully rewarding experience all around. It may be required every year now to give me that inspirational kick I may need. And that is a true accomplishment. **** out of ****",10,1,5,13 February 2007

War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds (2005) ***1/2
","!(Spoilers at the End)!This could be the magical remake that has achieved what no other modern re-do has ever made me think was possible: it made me re-think my staunch resistance to modernizing old classic films and stories that I've always felt do not require any further tampering. Steven Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time, and is a thrill ride from start to finish that completely blew my mind. It's a movie that is essential to view on the big theatre screen, although of course that will not be the way most of us will have had the pleasure of seeing it in the grand scope of things for the future.I've been surprised that so many moviegoers have been on record as feeling anything less than captivated by this terrific feature. I'm positive that a portion of the naysayers (as of this writing) have a chip on their shoulders either against director Spielberg (who's been touted as the 'too soft moviemaker who ruined the business by causing the Summer Blockbuster Phenomenon') and/or lead star Tom Cruise (who's been in the news lately for all sorts of nonsense, much of which I agree with his detractors makes him look rather foolish) but there is much to admire in WAR OF THE WORLDS, and coming from an old stick in the mud like me who's against updated re-imagining's, that's saying a whole lot.In the film, Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as Ray, an irresponsible man living in a dump of a home who is spending some weekend time with his teenage son and little daughter, having been divorced from their mother. Mom has a new man in her life, and even the kids like him better than their dad. This struggle between children and father, as they awkwardly try to make a go out of their strained relationship, is put to an extraordinary test when all hell breaks loose one fateful day, and an alien invasion threatens the Earth. Utilizing some of the most realistic and jaw-droppingly awesome special effects ever committed to celluloid (and this coming from a fan who's always despised CGI technology, mind you) we see massive ships erupt out of the ground, buildings exploding, death rays physically obliterating screaming citizens fleeing for their very lives, and the whole foundation of civilization crumbling beneath our feet. This is a dark, scary, tension-filled masterpiece, seen through the eyes of Cruise's character and his children. Dakota Fanning is excellent as the fearful little daughter, and she continues to impress me in anything I see her in. Along with the visual marvels we're assaulted with throughout the show, it's also the heart and soul that Ray starts to show toward his kids that makes this a more personal experience, and not 'only' a circus of gadgetry and eye-popping wonder. Ray is desperate to protect his son and daughter throughout all impossible odds. A fine example of this newfound devotion is in a necessary sequence involving Tim Robbins as an eccentric survivor who takes Ray and his little girl into his meager shack of a home to escape the devastation that is thundering all around them. When it's revealed that Robbins is more than a little unstable, Cruise's character must make a decision that demonstrates the lengths he'll go to in order to take care of his daughter, while Spielberg also gives some backbone to Ray through his handling of the situation. (Spoiler Below):Now I have to say a word about the much-talked-about ending of this movie. I think the upbeat conclusion was the only way this story should have ended, as written in the original HG Welles book. However, I do have one reservation -- there has been some controversy as to whether or not Spielberg did the right thing by allowing Ray's son to survive this incredible ordeal, given that an earlier segment played very powerfully by having the boy risk his life and obviously not making it through alive. It was a strong and poignant sequence that would have resonated all the more by an ending that still would have emerged as a happy one, albeit with the loss of one of the family members. I must agree with many people who have said this would have been a much more true and noble finish. It's just a little nick in what is otherwise a sensational and un-flawed piece of film-making. As it turned out, the revelation of the son (which I hoped was not coming even though I knew it probably would) didn't destroy the wonderful time I had overall. The fact is I wound up exiting the movie theatre feeling very good, and with an exciting and touching film experience still fresh in my mind as I walked to my car and made my way home. This was an elation I just don't get with new movies anymore. Ironically enough, one of the last times I've ever felt this was back when JAWS was first released.

Wedding Crashers," Wedding Crashers (2005) BOMB
","Oh My God. I love crazy and untamed comedies when I'm in the mood for them, and last night I was in the mood for one. Everybody I know had told me how hilarious and wild this film was supposed to be, including my own wife, who had already seen it in the theatre with a bunch of her girlfriends one day. So she was willing to watch it again and we rented it. Well, it just so happened that my sister and her husband were getting ready to rent the very same title, so we decided to go to their place and watch it together, along with my 16-year-old nephew.Well, we all hated this movie - including my wife this time, and she couldn't understand how she'd previously found it so amusing. There are practically no laughs here, and it's a one-joke film that shoots its load early on. Yes, we get that Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn find their kicks by crashing people's weddings and it's a chuckle for the first couple of minutes of montages... so now what? Well, we then introduce more unlikable people (another insufferable appearance from Christopher Walken, blah) and toss in an excruciating love story to involve the one Wedding Crasher with the busted nose falling for one of the pretty young females at one reception. I hate to sound so juvenile, but only getting to gawk at the still-lovely 50-something Jane Seymour strutting about in the nude like a slut managed to arouse my interest for a minute. The idea that she would even lower herself in such a manner is besides the point, but at least I kept my eyes open for her contribution. (I later learned she used a body double). It's a shame that the DVD became defective at this moment, the picture kept breaking up, and jumped ahead during her seductive sequence; evidently I wasn't the only renter who at least found this scene interesting. 0 out of ****",1,2,4,12 February 2006
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Blood (2007) **1/2
","I always see this movie lumped along with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as two of the 'new greats', but if I am to be completely honest, this was another disappointment. So I guess it's fitting that I feel similarly about both. Daniel Day-Lewis was pretty intense in his part, yes... even though it often seemed like he was putting on a caricature. If it weren't for his seedy and gradually more declining snake of an unscrupulous oil businessman there wouldn't have been much to stick around for. I had to love the photography and locations, which really gave this picture a vivid feel for the early 1900s. Just about all the scenes featuring both Day-Lewis and Paul Dano (who played the overbearing young preacher) were fun, and often times downright laughable - whether intended or not. The relationship between Daniel and his son was involving.But when I got right down to it, I had to ask 'what's the point?'. I haven't read Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel called 'OIL!', on which this film was based; so I guess it's yet another tale of what money, greed, power, authority, and religious obsession can do to people? And I had to honestly ask myself if I would have even bothered, had THERE WILL BE BLOOD not been praised at the Oscars? Was it worth dedicating two and a half hours of my life to? Will I ever desire to watch this again and again? For a lot of movie buffs I think this film is a good example of trying to savor something that's popular and deemed an exceptional movie when it's really not all that. I can't imagine that some of the ratings would actually be as high as they are for this, had it never been highly touted, or if there were no pre-conceived standards for it. I found myself almost liking the good qualities about it enough to stretch it to a more respectable three stars, especially considering its supreme status... but forget that. Liking the acting and cinematography, a few odd sequences now and then, but ultimately wishing it was at least 45 minutes shorter and checking the clock ... that can't be 'good'. **1/2 out of ****",6,2,6,27 December 2008
To Kill a Mockingbird," To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) ***1/2
","Based on the classic novel by Harper Lee, this wholesome adaptation stars Gregory Peck in an Oscar-winning part as Atticus Finch, a righteous defense lawyer during the depression era down South. He's a loving single parent who tries to instill values into his two children, Jem (Philip Alford) and his younger sister 'Scout' (Mary Badham). The story is told as a flashback from the perspective of a now-grown Scout (who narrates) during one memorable summer in her youth where her father elected to defend a Negro farmhand named Tom Robinson (Brock Peters). At a time when black people were not well respected in small southern towns, Finch stands alone in his plight to help the innocent young man who has been wrongly accused of raping and beating a white woman. Brock Peters is highly sympathetic as the good-natured Robinson during an unfair courtroom trial, with Gregory Peck as his well-meaning attorney with the odds stacked against him. Fine acting also by young Alford and especially Badham as the children learning about bigotry through their dad in addition to the ongoing trial. Robert DuVall makes his very first motion picture appearance in a small but unforgettable part that remains crucial to the success of the story. ***1/2 out of ****",9,18,27,2 February 2005
A Hard Day's Night," A Hard Day's Night (1964) ****
","The Beatles' first classic movie is a nostalgic time capsule that manages to embody a very special age of innocence from the early 1960's, when four young men from Liverpool England practically took over the world with their marvelous music and charismatic charm and wit. Director Richard Lester is to be commended for successfully capturing all of the excitement and joyful hysteria of these times for historical posterity. For anyone new to The Beatles who's looking to discover what they were all about, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is the perfect place to start. It showcases the four at the height of their early powers, before the psychedelic experimental period began and the latter breakup took its toll.Screenwriter Alun Owen spent some time with the Fab Four in late 1963, when a phenomenon christened 'Beatlemania' was descending all across Great Britain. He began to get a good idea of their individual personalities and what he wanted to write for a proposed film which would start production sometime in March, 1964. Even more appropriately, the Beatles' world-astounding popularity soared still further in the interim, after they set foot on American soil in February of '64 and became household names. The market was ripe for this film, which it was decided would show the rigors of a typical day in the life of the band at the peak of their stardom. The resulting motion picture was funny, clever, delightful and of course, musical. John Lennon and Paul McCartney penned several songs for inclusion in the film, all of them winners and two of which easily became #1 hits ('Can't Buy Me Love' as well as the title tune, which was actually made-to-order overnight after producer Walter Shenson asked for a song called 'A Hard Day's Night' which could run along with the credits). The film is very British, and the decision to photograph in black and white nicely compliments the aura of England. The Beatles are shown traveling from gig to gig, performing music, doing interviews, trying to outsmart legions of adoring fans, and generally trying to have a good time amidst all the insanity. While the Beatles themselves were not professional actors, they hardly had to be as they were essentially just being themselves, albeit exaggerated caricatures: John the sarcastic and witty one, Paul the professional lady's man, George the quiet cynic, and Ringo the lovable but mistreated clown. Elder British comedian Wilfrid Brambell was also cast as Paul's meddling 'very clean old grandfather', and is often humorous to watch, getting involved in all sorts of mischief, though perhaps the necessity of his character being added to the formula would be open to debate.A HARD DAY'S NIGHT is a special account of a very wonderful, if fleeting, moment from our entertainment history. We are very lucky to have this record of those special days to take us back and enjoy throughout the many different times yet to come.**** out of ****",10,13,18,17 February 2006
Hancock," Hancock (2008) **1/2
","I have to hand it to Will Smith... after having little use for him early on I've come to enjoy seeing him on the screen in his most recent films, even if none of them really blew me away. The guy has become an appealing actor to watch. That said, I was disappointed with HANCOCK because it started out with such promise but then took a complete turn in the wrong direction somewhere 'round the midway point and ruined for me what was shaping up to be a good film.Hancock (Smith) is a drunken hobo who, we learn right from the beginning, has been somehow endowed with special superhero-like abilities. He is invincible, cannot be harmed in any way, and spends his time flying and leaping into all sorts of local catastrophes to help people and set things straight. Yet for all his seemingly virtuous intentions, he is a cynical personality with a clumsy knack for not knowing his own strength and destroying streets and property in the casual manner in which he works his good deeds. As a result, rather than being loved and appreciated, he is vilified and condemned by the citizens of California and all of the news media. But there is hope when an aspiring ad man and his wife (Jason Bateman and the beautiful Charlize Theron) see the potential in helping Hancock better utilize his powers and gain the approval of the world.Without ruining anything for those who haven't seen the movie, the plot begins to thicken around this point and not for the better, in my opinion. What began as a touching and funny sentiment starts to mutate into something else entirely and, what's even more detrimental, there arise too many unnecessary explanations addressing Hancock's exceptional abilities which then leaves nothing to the wonderment of your imagination. These detours cripple the chance for HANCOCK to be something special. **1/2 out of ****",6,1,3,4 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith (2005) ***
","(Possible Spoilers)I thought REVENGE OF THE SITH was the best of the three STAR WARS prequels, and delivered everything I'd hoped for. This is the chapter where we come full circle and get to see how Anakin Skywalker becomes completely seduced by the evils of the Dark Side and transforms into the personage of Darth Vader. As Anakin, Hayden Christensen was much better in this than he was in ATTACK OF THE CLONES, and all those eerie moments where he turns into a misguided villain with hatred in his eyes were strongly rendered by him. Even Natalie Portman was better than usual as Padme, and though it took her three films to appear as more than just a pretty new Christmas ornament, I thought her love scenes with Skywalker were pretty decent.I have been championing Ewan McGregor's dignified acting as the younger Kenobi in all of these first three episodes, and he's as classy as usual here. However, the finest performance comes from Ian McDiarmid, in the role of the dubious Supreme Chancellor Palpatine.The last half is better than the first, and fulfills just about all expectations, as far as fastening all the series' loose threads into once concise whole and paving the way for the 1977 original (forevermore to be known as A NEW HOPE). SITH also benefited from occasionally strong (for this saga) material, such as what happens to the younglings. Hilights include more action-packed light saber fights (one of them being a re-match with Christopher Lee's Count Dooku), and the fleshing out of the little Yoda character, who gains our heart and has now become one of my favorite STAR WARS characters. *** out of ****",7,3,6,7 June 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes (2009) **
","With Sherlock Holmes, I've never read any of the old books, and I got my education pretty much from the movies. That'd be Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, who I still prefer to Robert Downey and Jude Law. But I do concede that great liberties were also taken even with those beloved 1940s Universal versions. It makes sense too when people point out that we love Lugosi's Dracula and Karloff's FRANKENSTEIN, but they're not the true versions as written either, not by a longshot. It really makes you feel like you want to give this movie a fair pass too, if you honestly consider that we let so many older things slide. However, I think it's not so much that there are changes and modernizing per se; the question is more: have these updates and changes worked for you? I liked the score in this film, which kind of reminded me a bit of the music in Jess Franco's 'El Conde Dracula', of all things. I thought it was good having the story take place in olden times, and I liked Jude Law as Watson. As for Robert Downey, he did not strike me as Sherlock Holmes - that is, not the vision of Holmes I have burned into my brain - but if one is willing to be more open minded in this case, he was enjoyable in the part in his own new way. I despised Rachel McAdams in this movie; she just came off as way too 21st Century-like for this era. My main gripes with the film are the same typical problems I find with so many newer movies... way too many climaxes (is it over now? How about now?), and that annoying 'woooossshh!!' speed photography and trick camera shots the filmmakers seem so compelled to do today, mostly for flashback moments. ** out of ****",5,1,4,3 January 2010
1408," 1408 (2007) **
","Based on a short story by Stephen King, this spooky movie starts out strongly intriguing but unfortunately lapses into tedium and predictable situations. John Cusack is at first interesting as an atheistic author who believes in practically nothing, and has published books on haunted hotels and other such spiritual phenomena. He then insists on spending a night in an 'evil' New York City hotel room numbered 1408, which has had a long history of unexplained deaths and madness for nearly a century, and has subsequently been closed to the public. Samuel L. Jackson matches wits with Cusack as the adamant hotel manager who does everything he can to dissuade the cynical writer from his research, but guess who wins out? Too bad things sink rapidly into clichés once Cusack settles in for the evening. No spoilers revealed here, but since we pretty much know what's going on between Cusack and 1408, it's hard to be very impressed or terrified. Instead, it's only a matter of how much we are required to endure before it ends. ** out of ****",5,5,8,22 July 2007
Raging Bull," Raging Bull (1980) **1/2
","I found this highly worshiped film to be very rough going at first because this real-life story of the very unlikeable boxer Jake La Motta was largely uneventful for a good long hour or more. In that time, La Motta bounces around from one mediocre boxing match to the next. He likes to yell a lot. Years zip by without meaning. He worries about getting fat. He meets Cathy Moriarty. I kept asking myself what was supposed to be so 'terrific' about this picture, and why wasn't anything interesting occurring? But I finally (and I do mean 'finally') began to become somewhat sucked in somewhere around the 75-90 minute mark, and then what I witnessed was good, solid drama. Robert De Niro was exceptional and Joe Pesci was well cast as his brother. Some good acting and a real feel for the era of the '40s and '50s. Not a 'great film' in my estimation by any means, and quite overrated when considered by the majority to be such ... but a 'pretty good' one by the time the last bell was rung. **1/2 out of ****",6,2,7,29 August 2006
Mr. Holland's Opus," Mr. Holland's Opus (1995) ***
","A heartfelt performance by Richard Dreyfuss is the strongest asset of this good, though not great, movie. Dreyfuss was nominated for Best Actor in playing Glenn Holland, a young man who dreams of one day completing a memorable piece of great classical music. In order to make ends meet and feed his wife and deaf son, he must lower his standards by taking on a frustrating teacher's job at a high school. Holland initially has a tough time trying to interest his lethargic students in music appreciation, but his efforts ultimately pay off as he begins to make a difference in their lives. Spanning a period of 30 years from about 1965 to 1995, the film does not successfully realize that transition as well as it might have. For example, I was able to spot a number of chronological errors in how the montage of passing years was represented. But one personal highlight in the film for me involved Holland's devastation upon learning of the murder of John Lennon in 1980. *** out of ****",7,1,3,16 May 2011
Ben-Hur," Ben-Hur (1959) ****
","I've always loved this film, but I recently realized a longtime dream come true by finally getting to see it on the big screen at a revival in New York City. How do you even attempt to write mere words to express how deeply you feel about a motion picture which you've singled out to be literally the one Greatest Film Of All Time? It's not easy.This larger than life epic begins as rich Jewish Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston, in a deserved Academy Award winning portrayal) reunites with his Roman boyhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who Judah has learned has become second in command to the new governor in the conquest of Judah's own homeland, Judea. Their pleasantly emotional reunion takes a turn for the worst when it is learned that Messala is trying to convince Ben-Hur to act against his own people by turning over the names of his fellow brothers who are speaking out against the new regime. Through a series of events, a dejected Messala falsely arrests Judah for a crime he didn't commit and sentences him to die in the galleys as a condemned slave. But Judah tries to stay alive long enough to return for vengeance, ultimately challenging Messala in the action-filled chariot race, which is still possibly THE most awesome spectacle ever put onto celluloid. Along his way, Judah periodically crosses paths with Jesus Christ who begins to have a profound affect on his life and his sensibilities.That very brief summarization in no way does this masterpiece justice, but is just a general idea of the basic story. I find BEN-HUR to be impeccably directed by William Wyler, a man who was known to drive his actors very hard to the point of exhaustion in order to get the very best performances. His efforts show themselves powerfully in each and every frame of this three and a half hour experience, which is also an accomplishment in that it doesn't feel anywhere near that long. This is a highly emotional film for the senses, which covers a plethora of feelings -- the struggle between good and evil; the thin line drawn between love and hate; the destructive outcomes fueled by anger and personal vendettas; the power of spirituality; the glory of forgiveness; the salvation of the heart; the hope for tomorrow.Beautifully underlining each and every heart-touching moment is the magnificent award-winning musical score by Miklos Rozsa, one of the most uplifting ever heard. Every actor gives his all to the movie, and that includes not only Heston but Stephen Boyd as well, who is flawless in his villainous part as the evil Tribune who is so obsessed with power and so hurt by rejection that he is almost not to blame for his cruel actions. Jack Hawkins is superb as Arrius, a senior Roman Commander on Ben-Hur's slave ship who admires the younger man's fortitude. Hugh Griffith is a joy as the humorous Sheik Ilderim (he also won an Oscar), and the often-underrated Haya Harareet is genuinely touching in all of her scenes.This is what's missing from the majority of cinema today (and has been for a long time). A film the likes of which we never see anymore, one which arouses every fiber of your being and speaks to your soul. Moments of this film are so deeply emotional, I cry. A truly excellent and inspirational motion picture by which all others might be judged. Uncontestable winner of 11 Academy Awards. **** out of ****",10,0,2,11 June 2004
Casino Royale," Casino Royale (2006) ***1/2
","All good things must comes to an end, and after the formulaic DIE ANOTHER DAY (2002) went through its usual motions it was evident that the long-running James Bond series had become a caricature of itself and hardly seemed fresh or cutting edge after forty years and 20 films. So Eon Productions took a major gamble in starting from square one with a different-looking blond actor, Daniel Craig, to play a new type of 007. The results are outstanding.Beginning as though there never was a previous James Bond in existence, Craig here is on his first mission as he plays a multi-million dollar game of 'Texas Hold Em' poker against the villainous Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) to put this friend of terrorists out of operation. Along the way there aren't any of those overblown comic book gadgets, so instead we have Bond slugging it out with thugs, and uncharacteristically doing a lot of physical running and lunging in order to take on the bad guys. Daniel Craig immediately slips into the James Bond persona like a comfortable pair of shoes, but at the same time completely makes the character his own type of secret agent; complicated and hard-edged, fresh and hungry for confrontation, and yet occasionally soft-hearted. Though the film is the longest Bond to date (2 hours and 24 minutes) the movie doesn't 'feel' long, as there are just the right amounts of action, talk, banter, suspense, and then more action to keep things nicely balanced. Oh, and there are plenty of surprises too.Bond gets his best leading lady in many years with Eva Green as Vesper Lynd. She is the perfect companion for 007 to become involved with, and they undergo a professional and private relationship that rivals all others in this series. At first I was a bit taken aback, however, by seeing Judi Dench returning as 'M' in this rebooted franchise. While I've always enjoyed her very much in the last four Pierce Brosnan entries, it's a bit of a strange mixing of two separate universes to have her associating with this new Craig Bond, as though she's stumbled onto the wrong set in the wrong timeline. All the same, Ms. Dench is very good as Bond's frazzled superior who frequently must put him in his place.The initial reaction to CASINO ROYALE has been largely positive, and that's a great sign. I've always enjoyed the other installments in this saga, but have to concede it was indeed high time for some sort of re-vamping. Daniel Craig is a tough and exciting new James Bond, and it's my hope that this series may continue and remain its own entity apart from the original lineup of Bond films. All those going in to this film should try to wipe the old slate fresh and clean from their minds and approach this movie as a whole new start on its own terms. It will be very rewarding. ***1/2 out of ****",9,2,4,21 November 2006

His sleazy uncle gets an idea to get a piece of the action in having his nephew pretend to be a mentally challenged person and then gain admission into the Special Olympics to claim the prize money.I am actually surprised this movie got made and released at all, given how uptight the politically correct world is today. Truthfully though, I was hoping it would be at least funny in the daring way a film like BORAT had been, and it's not very. Among the cast are some mentally challenged actors. Edward Barbanell, an actor with Down Syndrome, is quite good in his part. A couple of the other performers struck me as ordinary people pretending to be handicapped, but I could be mistaken. I couldn't take my eyes off that adorable Katherine Heigl, who I fell in love with recently after seeing KNOCKED UP, and who plays a counselor here working with the 'special people'.

Godzilla," Godzilla (2014) *1/2
","The stench of Emmerich's 1998's GODZILLA remake has been permeating in my nostrils for 16 years, so when I heard that Gareth Edwards was going to attempt a serious new 2014 reboot with Godzilla more or less resembling himself, I figured I'd give it a try. Besides, Toho Studios in Japan hasn't made a new Godzilla picture in something like 10 years... so what's the worst that could happen? If this new version flops at the box office, Godzilla remains dormant. If it succeeds, the possibilities are endless - perhaps even for Toho to return to their own series. So I was willing to give this the benefit of the doubt.The new GODZILLA doesn't suck as hard as the '98 remake did, but it still does nibble quite a bit. The main problem is that it takes forever for Godzilla to appear - something for like one hour into this bloated 123 minute feature. Now, I've always been a viewer who mostly prefers fleshed-out characters and intriguing story development over all-out brainless action ... but this is a Godzilla movie, damn it! I didn't check the time, but I wonder if Godzilla was seen on screen for 10 minutes total; it was like he was giving a cameo appearance in his own movie. And if you're going to attempt a dramatic first act or two with characters in an action-oriented premise, you'd better make them interesting. Unfortunately, the leads here are strictly one-dimensional. As the young lead hero, Aaron Taylor-Johnson is an expressionless cardboard cut-out. His wife (Elizabeth Olsen) does not make much deeper of an impression. The lead Japanese doctor (Ken Watanabe) barely has much to do other than stand around looking seriously constipated. (Of course, they couldn't help naming the token Japanese doctor 'Serizawa', after a character in the original 1954 GODZILLA; why do these makers of lesser reboots always think they're going to score points by name-checking people and things from older movies?). There were some semi-interesting early sequences featuring Bryan Cranston as the young hero's dad, but even he began to wear on my nerves after awhile.Twice I seriously considered walking out of the theater. The first time was after squirming too long in waiting for Godzilla to show his face (seemed like an hour, or longer); the second time was, after finally seeing him, getting continuously c**k-teased -- more than once, when it appeared as though an enticing action moment was mercifully about to begin, but the scene abruptly cuts away to something else, as if slamming a door in the audience's faces (and that literally happened during one crucial cutaway moment of excitement!). While I think of it, isn't it quite a coincidence how the main characters always seem to be right there each time a building falls or a monster sticks its head forward? It's also a small world even amongst hundreds of scattered victims, as they still manage to find their missing loved one amidst the hysteria.Some good things: first, I think it was wise to not make this another 'origin movie'; instead, it's as if Godzilla has always existed, but has been laying low for many years. Which leads me to the second good thing: having Godzilla awaken as a helper to mankind (I've always felt that a typical scenario with a villainous Godzilla angrily smashing the city gets tired really fast after one film). Third: having two other evil monsters for Godzilla to battle with -two gigantic, robot-like, insect-beasties (one male, one female). When these three monsters are ultimately allowed to tussle together, this resembles a true Godzilla movie and the effects are quite spectacular; regrettably, by this time it's too late. It's what we came here for, but there are times in viewing cinema where a plodding movie has over-stepped its welcome and is beyond total redemption. *1/2 out of ****",4,3,11,17 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope ***1/2
","My comments are twofold, so please bear with me while I discuss my viewpoints, both past and present.I think that from now on, with the advent of the newer STAR WARS prequels, this once 'sensational' groundbreaking film is destined to forever be relegated to a lower 'STAR WARS ... PART 4' status. Although I was a kid of 15 back in 1977 when George Lucas' original film took the world by storm, I somehow was never as mesmerized by this science fiction classic as my friends seemed to be back in the day. At the time, I felt it was overrated and that it single handedly managed to change the comfortable horror and science fiction universe as I had always known it. I was a die-hard PLANET OF THE APES fan and collector in the '70s, but before long everything became STAR WARS, STAR WARS, STAR WARS -- and even my once-popular action figures of APES characters like Cornelius and Dr. Zaius bit the dust in favor of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. Magazines like FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND transformed overnight in order to dedicate the content of all their new issues to this new phenomenon, cover to cover.Well, times have changed and I've finally come to really like the original STAR WARS film. It's odd that I didn't really appreciate it until I grew up, whereas the reverse is usually the case in most people's lives! But unlike so many very dedicated lifelong STAR WARS followers, I'm relatively a newer fan; and therefore I am viewing it from a somewhat different perspective. I have no qualms with the changes that George Lucas made, simply because I don't 'know' the difference. I'm positive I would NOT have liked him tampering with my favorite childhood movie, but you have to understand that I wasn't a fan at the time of this original premiere. And since I have pretty much stepped into this later in the history, re-discovering this classic after having just watched Episodes I, II and III -- I can see why Lucas felt some desire to try and 'match' the effects and 'new-ness' of the current prequels.Of course, STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE introduces us to Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), the 'elder' Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Together they set out to defeat the evil Empire headed by Grand Moff Tarkin (the great veteran Peter Cushing) and his villainous henchman, the ultimate bad guy - Darth Vader. The effects were out of this world (no joke intended) in 1977, but seem kind of dated when seen after the more recent prequels. But it's still a thrilling space ride from start to finish, with a great performance from Alec Guiness and some contrasting characterizations in Luke, Han and Leia. It's got a good plot, the strong central theme of good against evil, and some delightful non-human side characters in personable droids R2D2 and C3P0, as well as that large and hirsute wookie, Chewbacca.STAR WARS is a great if not flawless movie, but it doesn't really need to be perfect, as it remains an exciting and satisfying experience. The only flaws I would note (aside from it feeling slightly outdated) would be that Hamill, Ford and Fisher don't seem to be that seasoned; all the same, it's their characters which are varied enough to keep us interested in them (the young and adventurous Luke, the selfish and greedy Han Solo, the feisty and bossy princess). Also, it's a little underwhelming to see the formerly ruthless Darth Vader now come off as more of a 'Yes Man' to Cushing's leader. Quibbles aside, STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE (as I prefer to call it as a relative latecomer to this saga) remains a wonderful science fiction/fantasy, done in the spirit of the old 1930s serials and swashbucklers. ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,0,7 June 2005
Fantastic Four," Fantastic Four (2005) ***
","Intending to study cosmic rays, scientist Reed Richards blasts off into space along with his companions Ben Grimm, Johnny Storm, Johnny's sister Susan, and a rich but nasty industrialist called Victor Von Doom, who has financed the experiment. They meet terrible fates when they are tragically bathed in the rays, and as a result are endowed with different special powers... Reed is able to stretch his body indefinitely; Johnny can turn himself into a flying human torch; Susan becomes able to make herself transparent, and unfortunate palooka Ben Grimm is turned into an over-sized hulking monster consisting of orange-ish rocks. Victor Von Doom's body gradually begins to transform into metal, and he becomes the infamous villain 'Dr. Doom', now out to destroy the 'Fantastic Four' (as named by the media).This is not a pretentious or heavy-handed concept; this is a comic book story first and foremost, with the added quality of having characters we can get somewhat involved in. The film chooses to center itself more on the origin of these unusual characters and how their unnatural transformations are affecting them, and that's fine by me. Nowhere does this work better than through the sad and pitiful characterization of poor Ben Grimm, alias The Thing (perfectly played by Michael Chiklis), who gains our sympathy and delights us with the clumsiness and despair of his unwanted predicament. He has our hearts in his hard, bulky, four-fingered hands. He can also be funny as he constantly gets teased by Johnny Storm, who's always trying to get the best of the poor misfit. This was my very favorite element of the film, and it was in perfect harmony with the original comic book. I liked that the Thing's look was achieved through an actual body costume, rather than needless CGI, which didn't help the lousy HULK movie.Johnny the 'Human Torch' can not only be antagonizing to gullible Ben Grimm, but equally annoying to us as well with his boyish and gung-ho eagerness to accept his fiery new persona a bit too readily. But I suppose this helps bring some contrast to the proceedings, as Reed Richards as the rubber-man is kind of bland, and Sue Storm doesn't get to do much when she's not stripping down to become invisible (she's played by the ultra-attractive Jessica Alba, who's decent enough in the role, by the way).Not a great film, but a good one - and certainly enjoyable enough for a Marvel Comics fantasy. It would be nice to see a sequel now that the beginnings and problems of the lead characters have been effectively dealt with. I'd love to see Michael Chiklis climb into that Thing costume at least once more as he yells: 'It's Clobberin' Time!' *** out of ****",7,1,3,9 July 2005
Click," Click (2006) **1/2
","It was another rental evening at Blockbuster and since my wife was dying to see this I gave it a look too. It was actually a pretty good Adam Sandler comedy where he plays a very busy architect always on the go with no time for his family. He burns himself out and receives a super-duper universal remote control from a strange angel (Christopher Walken). Once he has possession of this toy he's able to fast forward through life's boring moments, turn the volume down on people he doesn't want to hear, pause the good times, and so on. But most importantly to me, CLICK actually ultimately had something to say about not rushing through life and taking people you love for granted. I thought I'd be in for 2 hours of nonstop zany toilet shenanigans with Sandler playing with his super-remote and 'clicking' his way through daily life as he forwards, rewinds, pauses, etc... And of course, that's largely what I got (and some of it was pretty funny); but I was taken by surprise by the serious and emotional tone it took later on. It became more of a drama in the later stages, much to its credit. For those of us who grew up watching HAPPY DAYS on TV, I was somewhat shocked to see Henry Winkler ('the Fonz' himself) now playing the role of Adam Sandler's dad - and also a grandfather!!!! Where does the time go? If only I had a slow motion button. **1/2 out of ****",6,0,1,26 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) ***1/2
","This is one of the SW films I've seen before, back in 1997 when they were re-released to theatres. I didn't recall much about it when I watched it again recently but found it to be highly entertaining and certainly a 'new' experience and a revelation after recently having become familiar with Episodes I, II, III and IV. It's much more enjoyable and interesting when you know what everyone's talking about! This being the second of the 'original' films, coming after the mega-success of the first movie, there was obviously more money spent on the sequel and it shows. Many impressive locations and effects, and I really loved the music score this time around (especially the ominous 'theme' each time we returned to Darth Vader's ship). Better performances from the main cast (especially Mark Hamill), too.One interesting observation for me is that I'm noticing how dated many of the 'puppet' effects seem today, coming after the newer prequels! This is unusual for me, as I have always gone on record as slamming CGI and always praising the 'old school' of rendering offbeat characters (I still do); but after enjoying little Yoda as an animated being in REVENGE OF THE SITH and now seeing a less convincing 'prop' of this character as originally realized for EMPIRE, I may just be starting to gain a slight new appreciation for some of the computer graphics. ***1/2 out of ****",8,1,2,29 August 2006
Sin City," Sin City (2005) **
","I've never read the original comics by Frank Miller, but the noirish ads for this looked delicious enough to make me long to see it. Very 'Gotham Cityesque', moody black and white photography, a fairly exciting cast, and the semi-involvement of Quentin Tarantino, one of the greatest filmmakers on the job today for my money.So what went wrong? Everything but the visuals. SIN CITY is extremely cool to look at and wonderfully captures the world of the comics, but that's pretty much it. Only one of its three vignettes is interesting, that being the one with an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke as the hulking brute Marv, who's on a mission to track down whoever was responsible for killing the prostitute he was sweet on. The other two stories (one with Bruce Willis, another with Clive Owen) are not nearly as involving. Even less effective is that the three tales don't mesh together by the time it's all over (and that takes forever). Action aplenty, but so much of it all over the place that it gets repetitious instead of thrilling. Performance-wise, Rourke is good (though some of that is due to his extreme makeup), but Willis seems to be phoning this one in. Elisha Wood appears ridiculous, and hottie Jessica Alba's acting is ... well, ...Jessica Alba's a hottie... ** out of ****",5,2,4,20 May 2005
The Runaways," The Runaways (2010) **1/2
","I became a huge fan of Joan Jett with her first #1 single, I LOVE ROCK N ROLL, back in 1982. For years I remained a devoted follower of her albums, saw her in concert up close at small venues, and even got to meet her in person on a few occasions including getting to go backstage after a gig in 1985. It was only once she'd become popular that I discovered that she was originally in an all-girl rock band called The Runaways. Thus I found myself going back and collecting Runaways records too. So for me, this film was something to look forward to.As Jett has confirmed in interviews, THE RUNAWAYS is mainly true, but there are some artistic liberties taken. The now-51, black-haired rock veteran stayed on the set so young Kristen Stewart (who portrays a teenaged Joan) could observe her movements and ticks, and also to make sure the story stayed somewhat in the right ballpark. The movie begins in 1975 and chronicles Joan's early years as a die-hard rock and roll chick with a rebellious nature who learns to play guitar and wants to form a hardcore, all-girl rock band ('No guys!' she insists). She stumbles upon the eccentric record producer Kim Fowley (a faithful rendering by Michael Shannon) who likes Jett's cool spunk and determination, but is more struck with the seedy possibilities of exploiting an orgasmic teenage girl band with guitars ('Jail-F'ing-Bait!' he exclaims with glee, pumping his fist). Together, Jett and Fowley seek out other band members. They comb the dark nightclubs where loud vintage '70s music by artists like David Bowie plays, for a blonde girl with just the right look to function as the lead singer for their group. It's there that they discover 15-year-old Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning), who's not far removed from her first period and who is desperate to become a singer. The Runaways are formed with Cherie up front possessing no strong rock chops, but getting pushed by Fowley and Jett to vocalize and gyrate like a slut having an orgasm. The girls practice enough to eventually get signed by Mercury Records and take off on a trip to Japan by 1977, which was the only place they struck it big, almost becoming as huge as The Beatles there. As many familiar rock and roll stories go, Currie becomes absorbed in the drug world and ultimately tensions mount within the group.THE RUNAWAYS was partly based on Currie's autobiography, and in a way she is the focal point of the story. Dakota Fanning does a pretty decent job handling this type of slimy material, considering she was only 15 herself during filming. It's too bad though that her character is just not that interesting and, for me, young Dakota never quite captured the presence of the real Cherie onstage. I'm admittedly more biased toward Joan Jett, but it's Jett's driving persona which is the most compelling ingredient of the film. I was concerned Kristen Stewart might think that sporting a dyed black haircut would be enough to become Joan Jett, but she actually nailed the aggressive nuances of Jett perfectly. Joan is portrayed as the one member in the film who treats the band seriously, loves and breathes the experience, is committed and tireless. It's a small wonder she had such a successful and long-running solo career after the group disbanded. And Kristen's singing just blew me away -- both Stewart and Fanning sang for the movie -- and Stewart sounds exactly like Jett as she belts out part of one of Joan's original early songs, 'I Love Playin With Fire'. Unfortunately, the movie only gets to see one song rendered in its entirety: 'Cherry Bomb' (sung by Dakota), which was considered the band's only 'hit', and was co-written by Fowley and Jett, specifically for Cherie to learn and sing. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good, with background songs by Bowie, Iggy Pop, the Sex Pistols, and even the real Runaways themselves. As someone familiar with the original Runaways recordings, it was fun for me to pick them out in snippets here and there.The problems I had which kept me from giving the film three stars were that this isn't really anything we haven't seen before, and it's something of a typical cookie cutter rock screenplay with no soul other than the determined presence of Jett. Really unfortunate was that the other three female band members were largely ignored. Not so much drummer Sandy West (who died of lung cancer in 2006); she gets a few lines and respectful moments. But lead guitarist Lita Ford (who had some fleeting success of her own in the '80s) was strategically left out of the action because in real life she and Joan Jett's camp have undergone some personal problems (Ford says Jett's longtime manager Kenny Laguna 'disgustingly' offered to buy Ford's life story for a thousand bucks). Reportedly, Lita has threatened to sue if not portrayed accurately in the film. While she is largely disregarded, there are moments in the movie in which Ford (played by Scout Taylor-Compton of Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN) completely comes off as a whining bitch. Most outlandish is that real-life bass player Jackie Fox was completely written out and is now replaced by a totally fictitious character called 'Robin' (Fox is a lawyer today, so one may assume the filmmakers weren't taking any chances). In 2004, one-time Runaway Vicki Blue made a documentary called EDGEPLAY which is worth seeking out for the real dirt about The Runaways. Joan Jett refused to participate in that project, but it's got recollections from Lita Ford, Jackie Fox, and Sandy West. It makes a good companion piece to this film, and doesn't pull punches. I had some fun with THE RUNAWAYS, but it's something of a watered down version of what actually happened and could have been a bit tougher and more dramatic. **1/2 out of ****",6,87,120,21 March 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," The Pursuit of Happy ness (2006) **
","What a joke this film was - are they sure it wasn't really supposed to be a comedy? The only reason I gave it an average rating instead of lower despite the nonsense all through it is because Will Smith was pretty good in the part of Chris Gardner (this is based on a true story, though I'm already reading there was more to it than meets the eye). Smith's cute real-life son Jaden gets to star along with pop. Poor old Chris -- he has so many problems, supposedly unlike the rest of us, the movie seems to be saying: His wife leaves him, he has to try and take care of his son, he loses a shoe, he gets parking tickets including even when it's not his own car, he has trouble making his bills, he has to struggle to make ends meet....... Give me a break. All throughout this film I kept shaking my head in disbelief and shouting at the TV screen: WHY DON'T YOU TRY GETTING A JOB!!!!!!!???. The stupidity of the story is that we're supposed to feel sorry for Chris even though he makes his own problems! He once spent all his savings on dozens of portable bone density testing machines and for years now has been wasting his life trying at least to break even by hawking them all around town to doctors when the product isn't popular and is probably already out of date. Even though these fruitless bone density gizmos have long ago proved to be a non-lucrative prospect, there is Chris, still fooling around with them and ruining not only his own life but his wife and son's. He's dodging his landlord with rent that's months overdue, even to the point where he gets kicked out and has to live out of a motel with his little boy -- until he gets kicked out of there, too, also for non-payment, and winds up sleeping with junior in bathrooms and shelters. He can barely eat, he has no place to go, the IRS is after him for taxes. So what does Chris do under such desperate circumstances? He takes another thankless position with no salary as an intern for a major brokerage firm, working for free! He has high hopes and determination that if he tries hard enough he may one day make the big bucks. This is all very admirable -- but what about surviving today?Look, the heart was in the right place here, and obviously Chris Gardner was more concerned with hoping that the end would justify his means. All I can say is, I have zero concern or sympathy for a man who doesn't do what he's got to do to pay his bills, his rent, his taxes, and to put food on the table for himself and his child. And this guy's supposed to be a great dad? There is no reason whatsoever why this man at any point in his nightmare couldn't have walked into the nearest MacDonalds or supermarket to flip burgers or stock shelves, at least to have some form of income. Hell, even get TWO JOBS if he had to! Why should I cry along with a bum who chooses to sleep in a public men's room when that's the path he chose for himself, and his poor little son? He still could have found a way to pursue his dream of making big money (as if a good job and big money is truly the 'key to happiness' anyway, but hey - to each his own). Chris Gardner was his own worst enemy and nobody's to blame but him. It's no wonder his wife left him. ** out of ****",5,1,2,22 April 2007
The Island," The Island (2005) ***
","Reviews for this film have trickled in which say it's a ripoff of other movies. So I suppose I've come to the conclusion that one can enjoy a movie even when it's said to be copied from another film (or films), so long as you're unaware of the fact while viewing it. Such was the case with me when I watched THE ISLAND, which I enjoyed very much; so much so, in fact, that I almost gave it an extra half star (but more on that later). To me, at least during the time I was watching it, this was an intriguing and new concept, as I haven't yet seen many of its noted forerunners, aside from, possibly, LOGAN'S RUN (1976). Taken on its own, this is an interesting and emotional story, with director Michael Bay's reputation for sensational action kicking into high gear for at least a few breathtaking sequences along the way.Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johansson are extremely good as two 'survivors' in a futuristic underground society, where they are conditioned to live healthy lifestyles along with hundreds of other 'lucky people'. Each inhabitant is warned that the outside world has become contaminated and unlivable, so everyone will remain and work together with the dream that, one special day, any individual at some given time may win a 'lottery' and be chosen to be transported to what is called 'The Island' for a future of happiness and contentment. MacGregor becomes curious of his very existence and the way his community is run, and eventually seeks to find out more. Escaping with his friend Johansson, their discovery is shocking and a hefty warning to our world today of what could happen tomorrow if we aren't careful.I don't want to give anything else away here, but this film kept me wondering what would happen from beginning to end. Are we witnessing life as it will be after a future apocalypse? Or is there something more corrupt afoot? While trying to find out, we are taken for a joy ride along with our two young leads, and get to savor a fine performance from Sean Bean (as the untrustworthy Merrick), as well as a fun characterization from Steve Buscemi, who was perfectly cast in his part and is given some pretty humorous dialogue.The only reason I found myself shaving half a star from my rating was that the movie offered roughly ten too many climaxes and seemed to go on too long. Which is a shame, as I would otherwise have deemed this a very good science fiction/action film, indeed. As it turned out, it's a good one - and what you don't know about the other films it borrows from won't hurt you. *** out of ****",7,0,3,27 July 2005
