The King's Speech," A Masterpiece
","This is based upon a true story. Before Prince Albert of York (Firth) ascended the throne of England,as King George VI, he had hired Lionel (Rush) a speech therapist to help him overcome his stammering when he had to speak publicly for official functions. Then he becomes king, and is terrified as he knows he will have to address the nation verbally. When something is almost perfect it is hard to know where to start. Everything flowed flawlessly.The acting by all was sheer perfection. Colin Firth was perfect imparting his fears to all of us. We felt for him and we cared, cared deeply. We were like his family cringing, hoping for the best, knowing it wouldn't go well, and were helpless to do more than give support and, in some cases, holding back tears. Thank God for radio. If television was around at that time, this would probably not have gone as well. Imagine having to speak to the entire population with a camera in your face and you feared stammering, stuttering and losing the confidence of your country, and there is no place to hide. Yikes ! Keep in mind that Hitler and Germany were on the rise and the threat of war was very real. So radio saved the day and the monarchy.The Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Firth) were well deserved. Other than a very touching, and heartfelt story, the thing I came away with most is this: now I know who Colin Firth is. Great job. He was perfect.

Moneyball," Good Sports Story
","This is based upon a true story.As General Manager for the Oakland Athletics baseball team, Billy Beane (Pitt) decides to revamp the game of baseball using statistics to select players. The stats are provided by Peter Brand (Hill), a numbers cruncher, Billy hires away from the Cleveland Indians.This gives us a pretty good view of how baseballs' General Managers operate and what they have to deal with. In this case Billy has to deal with more than most since he and Peter go against baseball lore, wisdom, history, scouts' analysis, long time baseball men and, of course, his manager on the field, Art Howe (Seymour Hoffman). And, the way things start out, these new ideas don't have the fans on board either.I did expect this to be more emotional as you would find in most true sports stories. I was hoping that it would not change me from the team I sometimes root for to be a Oakland Athletics fan. The pacing, dialogues, and good acting by all held me and I didn't need the Kleenex tissues by my side that are mandatory for watching true stories. You just know you are going to need them. But not this time. Although, I almost reached for the box during one of the last scenes when Billy was driving aimlessly (he does that) and listening to his daughter singing a song for him on the CD. I thought: here it comes as he has a big decision to make.This is a very good baseball story, but I don't see any Oscars for anyone in here. However, I am sure Brad Pitt will be nominated anyway. He is a terrific actor.There is a statement at the end of the movie that says when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series two years later they used a statistical system similar to Billy's.

The Avengers," Terrific CGI, Editing, Story and Acting
","Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) brings the Avengers together to locate and obtain the Tesseract, a cube of untold power that could possibly power the whole world, but it is also needed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) to open a portal for his army to come through and subjugate the people of earth to his will. The Avengers have their work cut out for them once they stop fighting with each other and learn to get along. This is, perhaps, the best CGI I have ever seen along with fantastic editing. I know in the past we had very good CGI with Beowulf, Live Free or Die Hard, Transformers and 2012 among some others, but a true salute should go to Director Joss Whedon and maybe an Oscar as well. This was truly well organized, and seamless throughout. The story was plausible without getting into silliness and unbelievable cartoon animation effects. And, effective dialogues helped make this as real as possible. Kudos. Who are the Avengers? Ironman (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), The Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). I was not familiar with The Black Widow and Hawkeye. I was looking for Billy Batson (Captain Marvel) but he was from an older time and that is the only explanation I could think of. Poor Billy Batson was probably in a old-age home, and he was never referenced in this. So,Â….. no 'Shazzam' for us. Pity. The thing I noticed is the storyline kind of continued a slender thread from previous Ironman, and Thor movies. Thor was assured that his love interest, Jane (Natalie Portman) was safe from what was going to happen in this Manhattan, NY location. I am pretty sure we saw Scarlett Johansson in one of the previous Ironman movies, but not as the Black Widow and am not sure what role she did play. And, of course, there was Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) Tony Stark's (Ironman) love interest. Yes, she still looks very good, but, at first I thought someone else played Pepper as the actress didn't, at first, look like Paltrow. But it was her. Maybe getting a little long in the tooth does that. Go figure. Hey, it will happen to all of us. Bummer. Also, we noticed that Tom Hiddleston also played Loki in the movie THOR. So this was like old home week for some of this cast and for us as well. Very good. I don't like giving Oscars to bad guys or in this case, bad gods, but I must say Hiddleston's Loki was very good and may get one. He was almost likable at times. Did I really say that? All in all this is one terrific movie and the pacing is excellent; and you will forget all about the snacks you brought in to see this movie as your eyes never leave the screen. It's mesmerizing. There may be some confusion for a while when you do not understand why The Avengers are at each other's throats for the longest time. And, you cannot figure out why Hawkeye is working for Loki (the bad god and stepbrother of Thor). But, stay with it and it will all work out and you will understand. The acting performances all around are first rate. And, again, not enough can be said about the CGI, the editing, the fights and battle scenes and the cinematography as well. All were terrific. Kudos. (10/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",10,1,5,28 September 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Terrific
","Treasure Hunter Ben Gates (Cage) learns that his great-grandfather may have participated in the Lincoln Assassination and sets out to prove great-grand-daddy innocent.Give me a grand conspiracy theory, and a treasure hunt and I'm yours. And, that is exactly what we have here. Of course, one has to suspend beliefs that some things can't be done: looking for clues in the Queen of England's office, the Oval Office, and perhaps, the hardest to suspend: kidnapping the President of the United States. But, it all works and quite smoothly, I might add. The pace and the tension are near perfect. There are some drawbacks, however (There you go spoiling things again).The car chase in London went on for too long and wasn't exciting. Why have it? The water scenes near the end of the movie were confusing, and although I knew what was going on, I couldn't grasp the scheme of the set in the sense I didn't know where everyone was -- not sure the director knew either. The acting by all was fine, but Harvey Keitel was wasted here. Ed Harris has the face of a good guy and he's made to be the villain and seemed to have trouble with that. 'Hey, he has the face of a good guy, get someone else!' Jon Voight was made to look like Philip Seymour Hoffman. Bruce Greenwood, a Cliff Robertson clone, is terrific and we need to see more of him. I was sad to his scenes end.And, the Queen playing Jon Voight's wife. Terrific. (That wasn't the Queen, you know). Now, I suppose you are going to tell me it was that Mirren woman? And, Nicolas Cage was the glue that kept it all together. Terrific. What a guy!The love interest between Ben and Abigail (Kruger) was there in name only. And that's a good thing because the chemistry just wasn't there to begin with. (So you didn't like it?) Are you kidding? I loved it. Like I said, give me a conspiracy and a treasure hunt and I'm yours. The rest of the stuff doesn't matter too much. Well, the Ed Harris thing was really bad. He shouldn't be made to play a villain.

Million Dollar Arm," Touching, Smart, Friendly and Real
","This is based upon a true story.Big time Sports Agent JB (Jon Hamm) needs to secure his position in the overall sports arena and things are not going well at present. He decides to go to India to get Cricket Players and train them to be professional baseball players. Later he learns he didn't get Cricket Players, but he finds two who have the talent to help him and he is determined to make it work.I had no idea this was a true story. Never heard of such a thing, but I don't follow baseball anymore due to the steroids/drugs scandals. But, somehow I am sure I still would have heard of this story. Didn't happen. Onward: The 2-India players: Denish Patel (Madhur Mittal) and Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) know very little English and there some funny, amusing things happen when they go to the United States. Of course, all doesn't go as planned, there are disappointments, some stress, and later a second chance. So there is hope. Why make the movie if there wasn't hope, right? That is why I watch. You? Onward: Bill Paxton as Tom House, the pitching coach and Alan Arkin as Ray Poitevint a retired major league scout give excellent performances. The acting all around is very good. Onward: we spend some time in India trying out hopefuls. Yes, we do see the Taj Mahal, heavy, heavy traffic, and a lot of excitement regarding the tryouts. Then off to the United States where the real training begins. There will be sub-titles until Denish and Rinku learn some English. The music is toe-tapping good.This is a good production: smart, touching, friendly and quite real. There could have been a little more humor in here with Denish and Rinku being exposed to Western ideas, food and technology (you always think that humor is most helpful). We really never know that when we see a True Story if everything is really true, but suffice it to say - from other accounts - this appears to be the real deal.If you want to know more about Denish and Rinku, go to Wikipedia and look them up. When the credits roll at the end, you will see pictures of the real Denish and Rinku. Quite good too. If I had been a Pittsburgh Pirate fan I would have known about this true story. HA!

Angels & Demons," Somewhat gimmicky but very good
","Prof Langdon (Hanks) has 4-hrs to locate the kidnapped Cardinals and find the bomb that will destroy the Vatican. I stopped reading Robert Ludlum novels (The Bourne this and that) as my page-turning hand couldn't keep up with the breakneck pace of the clues given. As I watched this movie I was reminded of the Ludlum novels and saw the parallels. Once the first clues were given we were off to the races. The music also played a big part and helped us run around Rome like a Wild Mouse (a ride at Coney Island) on the loose. The clues and the music made the 2+hours seem like minutes. It was over so quick. What a ride.Basically, this is a movie that tries to show the differences between Science and Religion. The Science part presents itself in the guise of a secret society called the Illuminati, who have been around for hundreds of years. The Religion part is represented by the Catholic Church. I call this somewhat gimmicky only because of the racing around to get to the next clue to discovering where the kidnapped Cardinals are and ultimately to where the bomb is too, but this is an excellent production. We get to see a lot of Rome ( I would also suggest you pause the DVD for those moments so you can get a good look). The acting is first rate by all. Also, the dialogue makes us feel privy to the inner workings of the Vatican. And, there is humor injected as well. Now, the getting around Rome traffic (to get to he next clue) in a matter of mere minutes is sheer Movie Magic. Can't be done. Been there, done that. I didn't know there was a person called the Camerlengo (McGregor) who has the power of the Papacy when a Pope dies and until a new Pope is elected. Of course, near the end of the movie all is revealed and there is a twist I didn't see coming. Will you?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,0,0,26 November 2009
Black Swan," Somewhat Perfect
","Nina (Portman) wants to win the lead in the Swan Lake ballet to play both the White Swan and the Black Swan. She strives for perfection but choreographer Thomas (Cassel) sees her as the White Swan, and not the Black Swan. She is awarded the lead anyway. One would not normally think of a ballet story as a horror story, but there is some horror in here. Ouch! Also, those who normally do not like ballet and who would never watch a ballet story would probably watch this one because they know they would only see snippets of dance in here; and also because of the intensity of Nina throughout and her drive toward perfection. But, One would believe that winning the role of a lifetime would bring huge smile to Nina's face and it did Â…Â…Â….for one minute. When Nina, happily crying and smiling, calls her mother and tells her: He picked me, Mommy, I would have given Portman the Oscar for that scene alone. That was pure gold. It was the only touching moment in this story. For the rest of the time we watch a never-smiling Nina struggle with her overprotective mother, her inhibitions particularly towards sex, friends, and not being perfect enough. At times, we in the audience, had a tough time realizing what was happening in real time with the sexual fantasies and hallucinations Nina conjured up. Even she believed some things were very real â€“ as did we. This reminded me of those imaginary friends some writers like to bring in to confuse the audience (read me).When Thomas kept saying to Nina to let go, have some fun with the dance, never once did he tell her to smile. That, for me,would have helped, but it wasn't in the script. Pity. If this were, indeed, a true story I suppose volumes would be written as to why Thomas picked Nina when he believed she didn't feel the part of the Black Swan. But, hey, this is fiction. The way ballet dancers primp and prime themselves reminded me the way thoroughbred horses are cared for. There are similarities, but the dancers must do all themselves. Were the split toes, webbed feet, cuts and stems of wings in the flesh real or were they also a part of Nina's hallucinations? We will never know. Production wise, this was a complete success. The camera work,direction, dancing, dialogue, editing, pacing, cinematography and yes, the CGI (What? You didn't think you would see CGI in a ballet story? Where do you think those black wings came from?) and the supporting cast were all excellent. But, make no mistake, this was also a dark production with some horror thrown in. Yes, I jumped several times as I didn't expect horror in a ballet story. Who would?But, the question for us is: Did WE care for Nina? Yes, we did because we always care for and feel the pain of someone who wants to be the best, andÂ…. um okayÂ….strives to be perfect. If you keep in mind that Nina considers herself THE BLACK SWAN you will understand all. And, finally a somewhat smiling, perfect Black Swan.Violence; Yes. Sex: Yes, there is a lesbian scene.

Changeling," Powerful
","Christine Collins' (Jolie) son, Walter, is missing, feared kidnapped, and when the police return her son to her, she sees the boy is not Walter. This is a true story. And, for such a true story back there in 1928, where was this story before? How many other stories are hidden from us that show police corruption and complete disregard for citizens rights? As you go on in this story you will see that one person can make a difference and affect the necessary changes to correct to something we thought was there all along.Angelina Jolie plays the part of the wronged mother to perfection and her nomination of Best Actress was well deserved. John Malkovich is, well, John Malkovich and his very name is synonymous with the definition of perfection. Jeffrey Donovan is a new comer who has his own TV show, Burn Notice, and did an excellent job. He sometimes let a little Scottish accent creep into his dialogue, and I liked that. In the story Christine plays a telephone operator supervisor and that was the first time I ever saw or even heard of those supervisors using roller skates to roll up and down the long line of the regular telephone operators. Imagine what the first job interview must have been like - Q: Can you roller skate? A: What? I thought this was a telephone jobÃ‚â€¦Ã‚â€¦The movie is a little too long with too many anti-climatic moments Ã‚â€“ when you think it's over, it's not. But, seeing as this is a true story we need to see it to the end regardless of its length. This could very well have been nominated for Best Picture. Clint Eastwood is a Master Director.

Men in Black 3," Well Worth the Wait. Kudos
","The MIB team is again in the process of saving the earth from alien invasion, but this time Agent J (Will Smith) needs to go back in time - 1969 - to prevent Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) from being assassinated by Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). This was definitely worth the wait. We see excellent CGI with aliens interacting nice with each other and with humans, but we also see the bad CGI aliens fighting with humans; There were good acting performances all around, and a lot of comedy within smart dialogue. A nice touch in the beginning was when there was a moment of silence and a sort of (read: really bad) eulogy by Agent K for the former head of MIB, Zed (Rip Torn), who had passed away. Zed's replacement is Agent O (Emma Thompson). We are not sure why Rip Torn was not in this movie. A younger Agent K - back in 1969 - is played by Josh Brolin who steals the show, and nails Tommy Lee Jones' voice and cadence. That combination helps put this MIB (better than MIB 2 and on a par with the first MIB) over the top. Kudos. Now for the question you may have: why didn't Agent J see himself when he went back to 1969. Well, that was 43-yrs ago and Agent J was either a kid or wasn't born yet. See?We get a good script, plausible story, some good comedic lines, as well as some philosophical discussion when Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarj) comes on the scene with his predictions of what is about to happen. Griffin lives in all 5-dimensions and sees all possibilities and the outcomes of all realities (Yes, he has that Robins Williams look about him). He can transcend time as he appears in 1969 and in the present. We may learn more about him in future MIBs. BTW: when is the next one?Violence: Yes.

Frost_Nixon," This is a big deal
","David Frost (Sheen) interviews former President Richard Nixon (Langella) to get Nixon to admit to wrongdoing and a cover-up in the Watergate Scandal.Two lost men: Frost and Nixon. Frost was lost because he thought he would make a name for himself by the interview and had a lot of trouble getting financial backing and some of his shows were pulled. He was at his wits end until he decided to fund the project himself and then later syndicate it. Nixon was lost because he did the unthinkable: resigned the presidency and that was tough to live with. Then comes this showman Frost who wants an interview and for Nixon to admit to wrongdoing and a cover-up. If he admits to that, he would compound his guilt and be forever lost. He was hoping the interview would get him some credibility, sympathy , and perhaps some understanding from the American people of why he acted the way he did. What keeps this movie engaging are the behind the scenes deals going on before and during the interview. These are things the public is not privy to and when they involve a president of the United States the public stays tuned in. Inquiring minds, you see.From a historical point of view this is a big deal. How big a deal will be told by historians way down the road. But, we don't have to wait for them. It's a big deal now. Langella steals every scene and rightly so. He is a presence. After a while watching the interviews, especially the last one I never saw Langella, I saw Nixon. I never saw the actual TV broadcast of the interviews and I don't think I need to. Langella captured Nixon perfectly and I came away with the feeling that others watching also didn't want to hit a man when he's down. So maybe Nixon did come away with some of that understanding mentioned above, but he would always be forever lost and he understood that. Langella was nominated for Best Actor and should have gotten it. Ron Howard was nominated for Best Director. Didn't win. And, Frost Nixon was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Also didn't win. The production was good, the acting and dialogue by all was also good, but it was Langella who makes all this work. Most of us know the outcome but it's in the telling that people should see this. That and Frank Langella's portrayal of Richard Nixon. Two Lost Men: Frost and Nixon. One wins and the other remains forever lost. Very sad.Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, some not much, but one big F-bomb by Langella.",9,2,5,31 May 2009
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Disappointing
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) again battle wits with arch enemy Professor James Moriarty. There is wrong-doing afoot. Our entertainment history is being rewritten to such a point we will no longer know or remember what came first. What we have now is a Sherlock Holmes as an Action Hero, something Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never contemplated. Now the Green Lantern is gay. Spiderman once had a dark suit. Snow White will now be remembered for her troubles with an evil Queen and not for those happy-go-lucky dwarfs (except for Grumpy, of course). Where will it all end? Will Anne of Green Gables become the new Laura Croft? Will Nancy Drew become a hit-manÂ…umÂ… woman? Will the Hardy Boys become the new Batman and Robin? And, those poor three little pigs, what will they become? And, will we ever hear that we are glad those superheroes are on our side or hear the last line in the fairytale that 'they lived happily ever after?' Point made? Maybe. I feel many of us would have liked Robert Downey Jr to become another Action Hero (yes, other than Iron Man) with another name and not Sherlock Holmes. And, he still could have a sidekick as, perhaps, a Watson with another name too. Put Sherlock Holmes back where he belongs. Downey is not even close to being a Sherlock Holmes. But, it is what it is and we have what we have and there doesn't seem to be much any of us can do about it. Well, that is, unless I become king. Then it will change back to what it all was. Pity that it cannot happen. I would be a good king. As for this event, you will see a lot of very good CGI, a very fast talking Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr ) because -- remember: he doesn't have a British accent and his talking at light speed will cover that up. So what we have here are fiction, and fantasy where only the names remain the same as written by Sir Arthur, who at this point must be spinning in his grave at warp speed. The first half of this movie is a complete mess. Nothing flowed where one could understand what was going on; hence nothing was going on. When characters talk in darkened scenes with clipped English, it is difficult to follow anything. What we heard was something about Watson's marriage, mind games with Moriarty that came to nothing, and protecting a gypsy fortune teller (Noomi Rapace as Madam Heron) whose brother is missing. The second half was more in tune with what the movie should have been all along, but still there was no caring about anything except to have this over with. And, it was much too long. Downey's Holmes overacts all the way thru and this is most annoying. He is too causal and too flippant. The comedic banter between Holmes and Watson was lame, not funny and most of the time unintelligible. Jude Law's Watson tries to be serious but is often taken in by Sherlock's prankish behavior. Wasted in here was Rachael McAdams as Irene Adler. The only serious persons in here are Moriarty (Jared Harris) and Inspector Lestrade (Eddie Marsan) who together wished there was not so much action and a better script with the old Sherlock back. If you have no idea who the real Sherlock Holmes is, then never mind. Enjoy this mindless Action Hero story and have a nice day. But, for the record, as an Action Hero movie with CGI trappings, let us hope that we have seen the last of this fraudulent Sherlock Holmes. Also, for the record, Robert Downey Jr is a good actor, but not when he pretends to be Sherlock Holmes. And, although I did not like the first Sherlock movie with Downey, I must admit, it was much better than this one. Had the scenes been slower and easier to follow, this may have been okay, but not the way it is now. The Editor must have been on a scene time limit schedule. Whenever old fairy tales or once admired Action Heroes that existed in our past come alive again and have involvement with the dark side or do things we are not familiar with Hollywood calls it 'rebooting' and we will be truly lost. Look what they did to the new Star Trek story. That, folks, is where we are headed. Yes, there is wrong-doing afoot. Can't you see it? Did I mention that I would be a good king?Violence; Yes.

The Monuments Men," Good and Important Story
","This is based upon a true storyIn 1943 President Roosevelt ordered a team of curators, and historians to join the US Army and they became known as The Monuments Men. Their task was to find and secure art treasures in Germany and countries under German control and return them to the rightful owners. The Nazis accumulated all this treasure to fill the Hilter Museum in Hitler's hometown in Austria. Hitler used mine shafts, coffins, German officer estates and various castles to hide the treasures until his museum was ready. However, when the war was deemed lost Hitler decried that all art treasures should go to German museums. There is another theory on this: Hitler wanted all the treasures destroyed. And, we do see some of that in here. This movie seems like it's made up for entertainment purposes, but this was a real happening. This also seems somewhat disjointed but keep in mind that Frank Stokes (George Clooney) sent out several teams to distant places to look for the treasures. By doing this we don't really get to see the real nitty-gritty of the findings in any great detail because time is of the essence. So we see bits and pieces. The main item looked for was the Madonna and Child by Michelangelo, and Jan Van Eck's Ghent Alterpiece. But, the bouncing around from team to team didn't help keep us attentive except for some humor between Bill Murray as Richard Campbell and Bob Balaban as Preston Savitz. And, then we also see another comedy team of John Goodman as Walter Garfield and Jean Dujardin as Jean Claude Clermont. The humor with both of these teams was on the down-lo. And, rightly so. The only story of note is James Granger's (Matt Damon) interaction with Claire Simone (Kate Blanchett) a French woman who collaborated with the Nazis. She knew where Hilter sent all the treasures and kept records of the rightful owners, We hang with Granger as he tries to convince Claire that the US government will return the treasures to the rightful owners. She doesn't believe him and is a tough room to put it mildly. We don't see much of George Clooney in here as he also directed this movie. And, because we see George Clooney's name in lights and we run to the show. George Clooney should talk to Clint Eastwood about acting and directing in the same movie. This really needed a command post that juggled all the goings-on with the teams. Didn't happen. Yes, communication wasn't as it is today. StillÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…The only real drama occurs when the war is over and the Russians are seen advancing to the last place the Monuments Men are finishing up. And, here we are fighting the clock as the very last item isn't in the truck and the Russians are closing in. If the Russians get there in time, they get to keep the treasures. Those were the rules. Such excitement! I could hardly contain myself. Long story short: the Americans did leave behind something of note for the Russians. Can you guess what is was?Now, we don't know if the names that made up The Monuments Men that we see in here were real or not as there was no acknowledgment of them at the end of the movie. Or maybe that was an oversight. When the credits run, we do see black and white photos of some original Monuments Men and the treasures they secured. Neat. There is no mention of any monument to these men, who by the way, numbered close to 400. By my reasoning, there should be something set up in Washington, D.C. This is an important story that tells of these brave Monuments Men who were heroes and saved thousands of works of art and they should be recognized as such. To be honest, I never knew this happened and was glad it did and the story is finally told even if somewhat dis-jointed. Everyone should be aware of the Monuments Men and what they did for the world.

Captain Phillips," Excellent, Engaging and Entertaining
","This is based upon a true story.Commercial shipping seaman, Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) takes his ship, the Maersk Alabama, into the Somali Basin in the Pacific Ocean and wants to have the crew perform security drills in case Somali Pirates come around. Later the Maersk is boarded by the Somali Pirates and it's up to Captain Phillips to protect his crew and the cargo. These days we see too many true stories, or stories inspired by true events made into movies and the key to an eventual good movie may be to wait things out until something happens. How much of these true or inspired by actual events movies are actually true we have no way of knowing. If we are entertained, we really don't care, do we? Well, the purists do, I suppose. But, this true story was reported via TV news, newspapers and magazines, worldwide and a book written, too, by Captain Phillips (A Captain's Duty), so we have some idea that most of what we see actually was true. Whether most of what we see in here is true or not, this is an excellent, engaging and entertaining movie. The photography, dialogues, editing and acting performances were unbelievably good. This movie lived up to all the hype Hollywood put out. Many reports of this incident said that Captain Phillips wanted to do security drills in case the Somali pirates showed up, but what we see in the beginning of this movie is that Captain Phillips was in the process of having those drills performed, BUT just a couple minutes into getting those drills ready, the Somali pirates show up. Okay, so maybe most of those drills were cut. We were waiting for the Somali pirates anyway. You may ask why the Maersk crew didn't have guns to ward off the pirates. This wasn't addressed except for one conversation within the crew that some complained they didn't sign up to be a mercenaries. Still the owners of the Maersk knew the possible dangers. I thought some statement at the end of the movie would address this concern. Didn't happen. One thing I didn't understand. Captain Phillips, at one point, gets away from the Pirates and goes into the water and didn't swim toward the Navy Destroyer and the pirates get him back. Did I miss something? You tell me. Or was this something that really didn't happen and poetic license ruled. Huh?Yes, it's a good story, well performed by all, but it's the photography that really captures you. It is outstanding. Combine all that with the Editing and you have something really special. The most exciting part of this is when the Somali Pirates take Captain Phillips hostage in the lifeboat and then it is here that we see the U.S. Navy and the Navy Seals come into play. You will be on the edge of your seat the whole time. Again, I cannot credit the photography too much. The photography and the Editing made this movie into something more than what we expected. The movie is up for Best Picture and Tom Hanks is up for Best Actor and some of that may happen. I would go for Best Picture. (10/10)Violence: Yes.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Watchwable Set-up for Part 2
","Edward (Pattinson) and Bella (Stewart) marry and deal with the consequences of a marriage between Vampire and human. The Werewolves want to kill Bella's baby because they believe it is a demon.The first story in this Vampire series was, perhaps, the best. The sequels just made a lot money and didn't progress as we had anticipated. Hey, we had high hopes. Didn't happen.What kept this series alive were the questions: Will Bella marry Edward, or Werewolf Jacob (Lautner)? If she marries Edward, will he turn her into a Vampire? If they have a baby what will it be: Vampire or human? If she marries Jacob, then what? And, will Bella's family ever find out what is really going on? Will we?Anyone who watches this Part 1 will immediately see that the story was stretched out waiting for Part 2 when we suspect many things will happen to conclude this saga. Witness the wedding, which went on for too long and where the dialogues were stilted and slow as lines were mouthed as though the characters were rehearsing them. And, the honeymoon also went on for too long and anyone could tell Bella was not a happy camper. The wedding and the honeymoon took up about half of the movie and both could be termed 'awkward.' As we watched, we kept asking: what is going on here?A spark of life comes on the scene when Jacob appears and the movie picks up some. When the Werewolves make their appearance, we could see the CGI wasn't as good as in previous episodes. We were not amused.This Part 1 is just a setup for Part 2 when everything will come full circle, hopefully. Also the acting performances were disappointing all around. Not good. We expected better after all this time.However, the very last scene in here tells us that Part 2 will be a real EYE-OPENER. Let's hope. Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, but this too was awkward and nothing is seen. Nudity: Partial. No frontal. Language: No.Rating: C (5/10)",5,2,10,13 February 2012
3:10 to Yuma," Excellent Western
","Rancher Dan Evans (Bale) hires on to help escort top outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) to the train station for transport to the prison in Yuma.After seeing this I think many will agree that the Western needs to come back big time. This is terrific and it's the acting that steals the show. You didn't want it to end. Yes, give all the actors Oscars as they are all deserving. When you put good dialogue with good actors you get the gold and there is no other way to say it. Hell, I was ready to saddle up and ride with them. One of the best lines in the story has some of the Pinkerton men saying they don't want Wade to know where they are taking him. Wade (Crowe ) says something like - it would be nice to know in case we get separated then we could meet up again. HA! How good is that? Some F-bombs were dropped (only) in the beginning and why they do that is beyond me. To get an R rating? Putting Mature Theme and Violence would seem, to me, to be good enough to get an R rating, but I wasn't consulted.

The Equalizer," Most Entertaining
","Retired CIA agent Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) tries to lead a quiet life, but a near-death beating of escort/prostitute Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz) by the Russians changes that quiet life. This movie is based upon The Equalizer TV show in the mid-1980s starring Edward Woodward. A good show btw.In the beginning of this movie we are shown a statement by Mark Twain that says there are two important days in a man's life: the day he is born and the day he finds out why. This applies to Robert McCall as you will see.. And yes, it applies to all of us too. That is probably the most provocative thing Mark Twain has ever said. McCall is the Calm before the Storm and then he becomes the Storm as you will see. Okay, a Quiet, Controlled Storm.The movie starts off slowly to set things up for McCall to help Alina. McCall tries to buy Alina's freedom from the Russians and you know that won't work. There is only one thing left to do and he does it. Problems continue when the big boss Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich), in Russia, sends his top enforcer Teddy (Marton Csokas) to find and kill McCall. You will note that McCall calls Teddy, Nicholi. Csokas does a very good job of being McCall's antagonist and I am sure we will see more of him.The acting all around is excellent. The fighting scenes are brutal and intense. You will see blood. The music is heart-racing all the way through and pretty good too. A downside I found was the big fight scene within the place McCall works, Home Mart (like Home Depot). Too many scenes in the dark . Still good, but in the dark (you said that already). Move over Jason Bourne, Bond, James Bond and the Liam Neeson character with the skills to right all wrongs, we have another player, a Vigilante, if you will, who has decided he knows why he was born. At the end McCall becomes The Equalizer as we see him offering to help someone as he replies on his laptop. Did I hear someone say 'Sequel?'This is most entertaining and we like the quiet, controlled storm Denzel Washington brings to Robert McCall, the Equalizer. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

The Expendables 2," Stunts and CGI win this one
","The Expendables team is after bad guy Villain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) who stole plutonium to be sold to the highest bidder for the making of bombs. The only reason to watch this movie is to see the stunts and the CGI and they are spectacular. So if you like continuous motion of explosions all over the place, this is for you. The acting is okay, and the best line to come out of this is when Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) gives the team another plane as theirs was destroyed on a previous mission. They look at the plane and Barney (Stallone) says, 'that belongs in a museum.' To which Trench (Schwarzenegger) says, 'we all do.'The rest of the team is made up of former (and may still be active when they receive their supply of Ben-Gay) action heroes: Jason Statham, Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and Dolph Lundgren. Other not so well-known team members are Nan Yu as Maggie, and Liam Hemsworth as Billy the Kid.Jokes are made of Gunnar's (Dolph Lundgren) intelligence because Gunnar is a M.I.T. graduate among other things but chooses to be a member of this team. However, if you Google Dolph Lundgren on Wikipedia, you will see that Lundgren has a Master's degree in Chemical Engineering and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to M.I.T.

Source Code," Very Creative. Good Thriller
","Captain Stevens (Gyllenhaal) wakes up on a train and discovers he is in someone else's body, and he has a mission to find out who the bomber is.Remember Ground Hog Day? Avatar? Well, it's like them almostÂ…Â…somewhatÂ…...kinda. Stevens has to keep going back in time until he finds out who the bomber is. Just enjoy this and don't try to figure out how the Source Code interacts with things. It's like one of those time travel stories that you can never follow anyway. Accept it. Actually, that is all you can do because the explanation of the Source Code is lacking or I missed it. Oh, you get bits and pieces of the Source Code and who runs the operation, but the logistics of it is just not there for us to grasp. You understand about the 8-minutes of someone's life in that Stevens has 8-minutes to find the bomber each time he goes back in time. But, this concept is very creative and we are exposed, in theory, to multiple realities. (What you talking about, Willis?) Ah, so you were paying attention. You'll see when you come to the end of the story. Great ending btw. The acting by all, the dialogue, cinematography, and CGI make this very enjoyable. Good thriller. Vilolence: Yes.

Skyfall," Very good, but Bond, James Bond is being rebooted
","Agents for MI 6 are exposed. MI 6 is attacked. MI 6 relocates. M (Judi Dench) is on the hook for letting things get out of hand. Silva (Javier Bardem), once a trusted agent, feels betrayed by M and vows to kill her. M knows the only man she can trust is Bond, James Bond (Daniel Craig) to make things right. Let the games begin. Most of the action in here occurs in the first 20-minutes. And, this action is incredible. I had to duck numerous times. There is more very good action later on but nothing like the first 20-minutes. How they did all that is a mystery. Wow !I want to say this was the best Bond, James Bond ever, but I cannot. Bond, James Bond is being rebooted. Bond, James Bond wears a beard for too long a time. Not good. Looks too old with it and is hardly recognizable. Q (Ben Whishaw) is now a very young person who Bond, James Bond doesn't quite trust at first. Q only gives Bond, James Bond 2-toys to help him get out of jams. Only 2-toys? Oh, the horror! There is no baccarat or even poker although Bond, James Bond goes to a casino in China. Bond, James Bond gets his vodka martini, but the words 'shaken not stirred' are never heard. There is no quirky one-liner Bond, James Bond is noted for after a tussle with a bad guy. The twinkle in the eye is never there. It was always there with the other guys, especially with Sean Connery. Bummer. Yes, changes are afoot for Bond, James Bond. You will be surprised to see who the new Moneypenny will be; but will Bond, James Bond toss his hat on the rack as he encounters Moneypenny before he sees M for his next assignment? These things are not important in the grand scheme of things, but they are things that endeared us to Bond, James Bond. And, we miss them. Bring them back. There are some other changes afoot but to reveal them would give too much away. However, the biggest thing in here is the villain, Silva. In past Bond, James Bond escapades there was never anything personal with the bad guys. This time it is very personal as you will see. And, yes, Javier Bardem as Silva is very scary. I feel the producers of the Bond, James Bond movies are making a mistake in aging everyone including Bond, James Bond. We do not want that. Like a favorite cartoon where the characters never age is the way Bond, James Bond should be portrayed. If they keep on the way they are going we will need a new Bond, James Bond soon. Hey, Daniel Craig is no spring chicken, you know. All my misgivings aside, this was still a very good Bond, James Bond movie. But, keep the white whiskers out of all this . Keep Bond, James Bond forever young and bring back those subtleties that keep us saying 'Bond, James Bond is our guy forever' If you bring back the quips and the twinkle in the eye we will forgive everything else. I miss Sean Connery, don't you? (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, only brief soft stuff",10,8,18,13 February 2013
The Young Victoria," Finally, a satisfying Royals story
","Princess Victoria (Blunt) becomes Queen of England, and later marries Prince Albert (Friend). I always like movies about the Royals. You get to see the palaces, castles, manicured gardens, the furniture, over-sized mirrors and the spacious rooms. I am reminded of a Nick Faldo (golfer) story he tells when he and his daughter went to Buckingham Palace for him to be knighted by Queen Elizabeth. As they walked through the palace, his young daughter exclaims, ' Daddy, this is where we should live.' Indeed.(Bob, is Helen Mirren in this?) No, that comes at a much later time in a movie called The Queen. (You sure?)Moving on. The young Victoria at age 18 is a feisty one and won't sign papers to install a regency until she is 25. She decides to wait until she can become Queen when her loving uncle King William (Broadbent) dies, and surprisingly, he does rather quickly. Now, as Queen she has to handle things with little experience, but she learns. We are only privy to the first few years of Victoria's reign. The notes at the end of the movie tell of her accomplishments with Prince Albert later on. They were good Royals.Good chemistry between Blunt and Friend and that is what makes this a most satisfying story. Also, the entire cast performed well. Excellent direction, cinematography and good dialogue helped a lot and the editing process didn't let a scene linger too long. Good job. And, for the Jeopardy fans, Queen Victoria was the first sovereign to occupy Buckingham Palace. Only one downsideÂ…. (here we go). With all the movements throughout the palaces and castles, I didn't see one painting on any wall. HmmmmÂ…Â…Â…Â… And, I wouldn't have minded if this lasted another hour. It went by too fast.

The Hangover," Could nave been funny. Wasn't.
","Four friends go to Las Vegas to give one of them, Doug (Bartha), a bachelor party he will never forget. The next morning three of them wake up with no memory of what happened the night before and they can't find Doug.This movie is a perfect example for not believing the hype when it comes to comedies. The new rule is if the movie is hyped too much (and it was), don't go see it, or leave the DVD on the shelf. This new rule should become a law. I'm working on that. No good lines, just the usual banter when not one of them can remember anything. Eventually, they find clues that tells them things, but not the whole story. No good physical comedy either. Nothing was funny. No one stepped forward with the kind of timing comedy demands. No one. Oh, there are some gross comments, but I wouldn't call them funny or even humorous. I guess they were expected to be made. And, here they are in Las Vegas. One would think there would be more shots of Vegas than there was. Total loss here. At this point I am wondering if the director was one of the three and forgot he had a movie to direct. Sad is all I can say.I would simply call this a slice of life as would happen to you and to me. Nothing funny, just straight up concern for what happened and where is Doug? That kind of slice. No one even tried to be funny. See? Also, I am convinced there was a reason that the actors weren't nationally known. Well, except for Jeffrey Tabor, but his character didn't go to Vegas. Wait a minute. I did laugh once. When the three are hauled into the police station and to get out of the damage they did, they made a deal and volunteered to be tasered to show school children what happens when someone is tasered. Kind of OMGish, but I have to admit to laughing.Now I must issue a warning. They find the camera and the camera pictures tell them all they need to know about that night when they couldn't remember what happened. These pictures run during the credits and do show nudity, and simulated sex. Again, there is also nothing funny in these pictures. Just some are crude.After watching many of these so-called comedies I just know I need to find my real home planet. In the meantime, I am going to abide by the new rule.Violence: Yes.

Iron Man 3," A Mess
","Genius and billionaire Tony Stark â€“ aka Iron man- (Robert Downey, Jr) has his world turned upside down when arch enemy the Mandarin (looks like Osama you-know-who) blows his house up and he vows revenge. Apparently, candles don't work. I asked in Iron Man 2 review that we light a candle to insure there would be no Iron Man 3. And, here we are. Pity.I have concluded that the only reason to watch any Iron Man movie is to see the CGIs and they are spectacular. No doubt about it. The story? Forgetaboutit. Really sad.Where to begin, where to begin? HmmmÂ…Â….. Again, a lot of the dialogues appear to be dubbed in and you can tell that right off. The music is lame for such a big-time action movie. Tony Stark is out of the suit most of the movie trying to be a human action hero. Hey, we go to the Iron Man movie to see Iron Man and that involves him in the suit fighting injustice. We see his Iron Man suits (yes, suits plural) break into a million pieces like cheap china. We see Tony Stark having panic attacks. Say what ? The bad guy, Killian (Guy Pierce), gives Tony's girlfriend, Pepper (Gweneth Paltrow), super powers for a short time while Tony Stark watches in amazement. Say what? Tony Stark befriends a 12-year old boy and these scenes didn't make any sense. Attempts at humor fall flat. To be fair Guy Pierce as Killian and Ben Kingsley as Trevor did good. Downey also does good but then there's everything else within the movie that doesn't work. We watch a real mess. Again, go to the Iron Man movies only to see the CGIs. They are truly exceptional.

Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Surprisingly good, great CGI
","Supposedly, the beginnings of Vampires in America and a story about Honest Abe (Benjamin Walker) as he hunts them down before becoming our 16th president. I had no idea who Benjamin Walker is. Anyone? Yes, I suspected, but had never heard the truth that Abraham Lincoln was a Vampire HunterÂ…..until now. And, now you will too, if you watch this movie. I can hear you asking, 'is it all true' Well, of course, it is. Hollywood wouldn't make up something if it weren't true now, would they? And, yes, they are finally admitting the truth about Edgar Allen Poe being a detective who wrote poems on his stake-outs. But, on to AbeÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…..as a Vampire Hunter.But first, before you turn away from this one, let me tell you of 2-scenes that are worth your time. The first one is a battle between Abe and Vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) on horses in a horse stampede. Yes, that's right. In a horse stampede. The way this was done was nothing short of fantastic and you will ask yourself ' how in the world did they do this?' The second one is near the end on a burning bridge the train is crossing. Unbelievable how they did this. Again, you will ask yourself 'how in the world did they do this?' They took CGI to a new level. You will be talking about these two scenes for a long time. Kudos, kudos and kudos again. The entire production, photography, dialogues were all first rate as were the actors within. The music was spot on especially with the train near the end chug-chugging in time with the beat. Excellent.Yes, there is some gore as Abe settles in to become the Vampire Hunter we know and love, and his weapon of choice is an Axe. Hey, he was a rail-splitter at one time. Keep up.Abe is befriended by Henry (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him how to kill Vampires. But, waitÂ…Â…Henry has a secret.The main villain Vampire is Adam played by Rufus Sewell and he is always good. And, we learn how the battle for Gettysburg was really won. Yes, the North won but now you will learn how they did it. Never before told.One more thing: finally, someone decided on a Mary Todd Lincoln (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who is easy on the eyes. Good choice. And, yes, Benjamin Walker makes a good Lincoln especially with the beard later on in the movie. It's true, I didn't want to see this movie much less do a review on it. A friend I won't name (Russ) recommended it and thanks to him I discovered the truth and it set me free. Now, I know all. Will you? (7/10)Violence: Throughout Sex: No. Gore: Yes, there is some.

In Bruges," A Masterpiece
","Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Gleeson) go to Bruges to cool their heels and wait for a telephone call from Harry (Fiennes) because the last hit had gone really bad. Ray and Ken are assassins.Remember the old saying, what happens in Bruges, stays in Bruges? HmmmmÂ…Â…didn't think so. Well, anyway, this is truly a good story masterfully told. All the cast are Oscar Worthy, but special attention must be paid to Colin Farrell. One day the powers that be will notice. For a while there I thought this was another Woody Allen movie - this time with humor -and humor abounds in here. However this is a serious drama that just happens to have some very good lines and, of course, acting. Timing is everything and it shows up in here all over the place. I cannot relate some of the good lines because some Language is associated with many of them. Oh, because I said Ray and Ken are assassins, please don't think this is another Bourne movie. No, this is rather slow, but very engaging. If truth be told, you will be sad to see it end. BTW, Bruges is in Belgium.Violence: Yes.

John Wick," Well Done Hit-Man Movie
","Mob hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) promised his wife he would quit the business and he does so for 5-years. Then she dies and for him not to be alone she had arranged for a Beagle puppy delivered to him at home. Then the son of mob boss Viggio (Michael Nyqvist) - who John Wick used to work for - wants his car ( a souped-up 1969 Mustang ) beats him up and kills the puppy. John Wick recovers and knows what he has to do. Let the games begin. Most hit-man stories have the hit-man (or a narrator) tell about his life and the specific numbered rules he lives by. And during the time of the movie, we will see this hit-man break every rule he has. This time it's different. This time it's pure revenge. We don't know the rules John Wick used to live by. But make no mistake about all this, now John Wick is out to make things rightÂ…Â…Â…Â…his way (get chills saying that?).To be clear we learn that everyone, including Viggio, is afraid of John Wick, but Viggio must protect his son from John Wick. The rest of the movie is a well-orchestrated choreography of gun fights. Some special effects regarding vehicles are included and are quite good. The cinematography in this gun-fest is also quite good. The music is non-stop heart pounding throughout. Hit-man Marcus (Willem Dafoe) is contracted by Viggio to take out John Wick. This is insurance in case Viggio's men don't get the job done. Keanu Reeves is the right actor for this movie. As John Wick, he doesn't talk much but his stares speak volumes (don't forget his guns too). In fact, I have always seen Keanu Reeves as the right actor for any movie he is in. After his character's beating when the car and the dog were gone I felt his pain and loss. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much.Rating: B",7,3,7,10 February 2015
Gravity," Over-Rated. Somewhat Entertaining
","Astronauts Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) are repairing a telescope in space when a Russian satellite explodes and sends the debris their way at very fast speeds. The beginning of this movie feels like it's the end of a movie when disaster strikes and they overcome it and we all go home. But, that can't happen as this just started. Bummer. Gravity would be better viewed in 3-D if you can manage it. The CGI visuals are truly outstanding even in 2-D. We see Kowalski and Ryan try to get back to the ISS (International Space Station) and one would think there would be tension and suspense during this attempt to get back, but this didn't happen for me. But, if you watch in 3-D you will be ducking debris every 10-seconds. Quite exciting though. For me, the tension and suspense came much later when Ryan was by herself in the abandoned Chinese space station. Hey, wouldn't you be tense in a space craft where all the buttons and controls are in Chinese and you don't know the language. Huh?Gravity was nominated for Best Picture. Say what? Give me a break. Sandra Bullock was nominated for Best Actress. Huh? The Academy must have had their collective heads in a Black Hole when they made these nominations. Sandra Bollock is a good actress, but it didn't show up in here. George Clooney was good, but his character acted too much like the disaster was a walk-in-the-park (I guess he knew this was only a movie).Still, this was somewhat entertaining, but highly over-rated. The dialogues between Kowalski and Ryan were lame for the most part. No good lines, nothing funny. The star of this movie is the CGI visuals and again, they are spectacular. But, that's it. View it in 3-D and enjoy it. Otherwise, it's a 'Help, I've fallen in Space and can't get up' type movie. (6/10)Violence: No, not between the characters, just the violence that occurred in space.

Star Trek," A Very Satisfying Movie
","This is when and where it all began for Capt Kirk, Spock and the rest of the crew. And, yes, you will be thrilled to know that they saved the Earth again. Well, for the first time, you see. I have to admit that prequels do have their place. We watched the Star Trek TV series with William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy a while back and still we cannot get enough of this series. Here we go back in time to see how it all began, and here at the same time, we see Future Spock (Nimoy) come back from the future to give most needed advice to the young Spock (Quinto) and also to the young Kirk (Pine).The acting by all, the story, cinematography, dialogue, stunts, CGI were all terrific and one couldn't ask for better. This was like a cool breeze coming at the right time on a really hot summer day. Most satisfying. Perfect. However, (there is a however)we didn't see any love relationship between Spock and Uhura (Saidana) in the TV series, but in this movie there was that. That didn't fit.And, of course, in our reality one cannot see and talk to oneself with one being from the future and one not, especially when one is one and the same person. But, in the reality of movies, this can be done and no one blinks an eye. Hey, we like good magic in any form. All in all a great movie and very satisfying, and maybe, just maybe the series will start up again. Let's hope.One more thing. Yes, they could have and should have had a place for William Shatner in this movie. And that, too, was something else that didn't fit for those of us who have watched Star Trek from its beginnings.

Fury," Cinematography wins this good war story
","Tank Commander Sgt Collier (Brad Pitt) is ordered to hold an intersection so the German troops won't get thru. The problem is that the Sherman tank (Fury) is disabled and the Germans are marching their way. This can't be good.What makes this a good war story is the cinematography. It is better or on a par with all previous war movies we may have liked. No, I changed my mind as I feel it is better than all other war movies. You almost feel like you are there. That is how good the cinematography is. The photography and the details shown are incredible. Kudos.I kind of wished this was a true story and maybe it did have elements of some true stories. I mean there is nothing new under the sun (except for CGI and Star Trek type stories) and the cinematography and heroics seen gave this impression to me. Also, in the beginning we are told by notes on the screen that the German Army possessed far superior tanks than us and we know our forces will be in for the fight of their lives.The acting all around was good. No Oscars, but good. The supporting cast (Shia LaBeouf, Michael Pena, Jon Bernthal) were spot on and when soldiers kill for a living and don't like anything to get in their way, they have a sort of superior attitude about everything. This showed up in spades. There was some very uncomfortable moments when Sgt Collier and Norman (Logan Lerman) the new guy to the tank crew, find a German woman and her cousin and decide to have dinner with them. Then the rest of the crew find them and well, here we go with the uncomfortable moments with these 'superior' soldiers. Downside: The tank is immobilized. The Germans find them. The spare ammo is attached to the outside of Fury. Why is this when they know they will be in the fight of their lives? Whaaat? The Germans fire RPGs and miss. Whaaaat? Germans run in plain sight of Fury so Sgt Collier can mow them down. Whaaaaat? Two hand grenades go into Fury next to Sgt Collier and later we see Sgt Collier intact and not blown up. Whaaaat?Those were the most glaring errors or mistakes I saw. But this does not take away from the movie as a whole. There is enough tension and suspense to hold you throughout the entire movie. Keep in mind this is a movie for entertainment purposes, but it also shows us the brutality of war. When the credits run we see footage of soldiers on both sides during WWII. Again, it is the cinematography that makes this a very good war movie and yes, I did wish this was a true story, and I have to satisfy myself with knowing that some elements were true.

Inglourious Basterds," Outstanding
","During WWII, a U.S.Army Unit called the Basterds led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) go on a Nazi killing spree and attempt to end the war by getting Hitler and his chief officers in one fell swoop. Not a true story. I almost didn't take this movie out because the promos made it seem like a unit of American soldiers went to Germany in the 1940s and acted like a band of wild Indians on a killing spree shooting and scalping Nazis. So the promos didn't do a good job of promotion for me. But, I took a chance hoping I wouldn't see what I saw in the promos: silliness, recklessness, ugly American behavior, and unfunny wise-cracks.However, I did see and hear all of that, but not in the quantity the promos seemed to indicate. This was a very well done movie and things were spaced out quite nicely. The DVD box said this was a revenge movie (hey, you finally read one). In other words, the story was all fiction. Things didn't happen this way. I got annoyed (here we go) with 2-things. Some scenes really took their time to develop, but looking back I see the sense of dragging them out (still didn't like it though, did you?). And, the other thing was the over-use of Sub Titles. Some sentences were too long and you had to focus on the words and not on the actors. Someone ought to make a law that declares overâ€“use of Sub Titles are against the law. Hey, they didn't need them in Valkyrie, did they? Go back and take a look at the 13th Warrior and see how Sub Titles were handled there. Both are great movies btw. What I didn't expect to experience in here was tension and there was that, and I suppose the dragging out of some scenes contributed to it. It worked. There is some gore in here. Some scenes will show someone being scalped (like the Indians did it?) and that is not a pleasant sight (turned away, did you?).The acting, dialogue and action scenes (no CGI?) were all terrific, outstanding in fact. Brad Pitt is always good, but special attention needs to be paid to Christoph Waltz who played German Colonel Lande. He played the always suspicious SS Officer to the hilt and was outstanding (using that word a lot, aren't you?)Unless I missed it, the word 'basterds' origin was never explained. I guess it just seemed like part of a nice title. The promos could have given this movie more credibility. You just have to see for yourself.Violence: Yes. Sex:Yes. Nudity: No. Gore: Yes, you see scalpings. Language: Yes, some only in the beginning",10,3,11,15 December 2009
Iron Man 2," Dumber than Iron Man 1
","Everyone knows that Iron Man is Tony Stark (Downey). What everyone doesn't know is that he is dying, but yet he has to find a way to defeat Vankov's (Rourke) Iron Man drones.There is Dumb (Iron Man 1) and there is Dumber, Iron Man 2. This is a CGI show and it's pretty good. But, the story suffered badly from a very bad script especially in the beginning when the audience needs to be grabbed. Much of the dialogues seemed dubbed in, just like in Iron Man 1. Not much had changed. Downey and Rourke come off better than anyone else in the cast. Paltrow seemed lost again like in Iron Man 1. Johansson, while still looking good, was wasted except for some Karate, Kung Fu and JuJitsu stuff if that was really her. Looked good though with those moves, whoever it was. Don Cheadle needs to stop being the second fiddle sidekick, and needs to find his own movie again like Rwanda. He is truly wasted in here. Rockwell seemed tentative in his bad guy role. Jackson seemed disappointed that he couldn't pontificate more. Like I said, this is a CGI show and it was spectacular, but the script really hurt the effort. Again, there is dumb and there is this. Let's all light a candle and hope there is no Iron Man 3. Now, if you are a true Iron Man fan, go read the comic instead. It's far better than anything Hollywood could do.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No hard stuff was heard, but the caption in the beginning saidMild Language, which means you could see the lips form the F-bomb words, but not hear them.",2,3,6,10 October 2010
World War Z," Pretty Good
","The Zombies are invading just about everywhere. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) a top-notch UN investigator is called out of retirement to stop the invasion. Yeah, I know another Zombie movie as if we don't get enough of them including those on TV too. The only other Zombie movie IMHO that was any good was ZOMBIELAND with Woody Harrelson. But, let's be clear: Zombies do not exist. Right?Actually, this one is pretty good. Yeah, I was surprised too. Hey, Brad Pitt is in it and he doesn't do bad movies. There is a lot of CGI going on for vehicle crashes and hoards of Zombies attacking everything in sight. Gerry's job is to find out what can stop this invasion and he goes to S. Korea where it is believed it all started, to Israel and then to Belarus to the World Health Organization Research Center there. When Zombies are not on screen, the acting by all is very good as is the suspense and tension. Okay, okay, the Zombies were good tooÂ…Â…for Zombies. I wouldn't call this scary, but I wouldn't let little children watch. There was one scene where I must have jumped back about 20-feet. No, I can't tell you what scene that was. I want you to jump too. I shouldn't be the only one. See?You don't see any gore except in one scene where a hand is chopped off so that person -who was just bitten - wouldn't turn. Okay, I did cringe some. See, when you watch a movie you have to believe what you see is real (It's only a movie, Bob).How would you end an invasion of Zombies (they don't exist, remember)? Think about it for a minute or even while watching. Gerry Lane comes up with the answer, short term though it is. But, it is very clever. Oh, there are clues along the way and later Gerry puts it all together. Will you see the clues? Huh? (7/10)All in all pretty good for 'another' Zombie movie.Violence: Yes.

The Hunger Games," Engaging, but a sad commentary
","Twenty-four teenagers, one male and one female from each district, ages 12-18, enter into a fight to the death as part of the government's payback for earlier uprisings. The event is televised. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) from District 12 takes her sister's place in the competition. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is the male from District 12. This movie proves that people go to auto races to see accidents. If you can get over the idea of kids killing kids, then you may enjoy this movie. How does one do that? Well, some will say it's all tastefully done; and there are instances where the killings come as a result of self-defense.If I said the name Katniss 10,000 times over and over again, I may get used to it. Every time I heard it I said 'catnip' to myself (easy now). Jennifer Lawrence, as Katniss, carries this movie to perfection. We know she doesn't want to kill anyone, yetÂ…Â…Â….there's that self-defense thing that comes along. Yes, yes, we hope she wins.Observations: the nervous camera was in evidence for about the first 15-minutes, then it went away as well it should. The people who run the television event and other elites have the most garish fashion sense. It's like they all came from the Mad Hatter's tea party. And, don't get me started on the hairdos, beards and a new way to slap-on lipstick. You see, because this takes place waaaaay in the future, we have to be bombarded with extremes. After a while we do get used to these fashion extremes. Sad, but true. I didn't expect the first half of the movie to drag but, it did with the training and securing of sponsors (who help the participants). The hype that went on for years before the movie was released didn't go into that. Each team is given a mentor to advise them on how to survive in the woods, the battleground for the Hunger Games. The Mentors were previous winners in the Hunger Games. Woody Harrelson plays a mentor part to perfection. The guy should be given Oscars for just showing up. He is that good. And, aside from Jennifer Lawrence, he steals the show. It wouldn't surprise me if Jennifer Lawrence is nominated for an Oscar as she was in WINTER'S BONE, a great movie. And, Woody Harrelson also.Other notables: Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, and Donald Sutherland who performed well. Donald Sutherland as President Snow says the thing more powerful than fear is hope. The way I see it the contestants and the parents of the participants have hope. The audience sits in fear. If the audience ever gets hope that things can change Snow's government will fall.There is a certain amount of tension and suspense throughout because we side with Katniss, who is wary of everything, as are we. Now for the kicker - more tension: the ones running the show can inject fire or wild animals into the event if they feel they are losing or losing face. Why they would do that blew my mind. Yes, that is not fair. The contestants have no recourse but to fend for themselves. The audience watching all this doesn't seem to be too upset about it. The audience is every bit of sheep mentality. Is this where we are heading? There are political agendas in here and you may see the implications.Here is what I was hoping for throughout: that the contestants or the audience would somehow put a stop to these Hunger Games forever. But the ending for this movie is extremely weak. Go see for yourself. But, oh, oh, a sequel is coming: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire in 2013. Sad, but true. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",7,1,5,19 August 2012
42," Outstanding Biography
","The is the true story of Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947 when General Manager Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) hired him to play for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Nowadays we see Blacks in all major sporting events and no one blinks an eye because these people are very good athletes, help make the owners a lot of money and the fans very happy. But, back in Robinson's time there was more than hell to pay for playing on a team of all-whites. The movie goes into some things regarding racism and very hurtful verbal taunts, but you must come to realize and believe that things were actually much worse than what we see on the screen. Branch Rickey's famous comment about finding someone who has the guts NOT to fight back proved to be the winning formula. And, if truth be told, the taunts, barbs and other verbal threats, in time, actually brought the all-white Dodger baseball team together and supportive of Jackie Robinson. One player even said 'maybe we should all wear the number 42.'In many respects this is not an easy movie to watch because of the racism involved. We don't think now like they did back in that day, but it was what it was and it's a part of a history we wish didn't happen that way. We cringed when things went against Robinson enduring the racial taunts, but we also became quite weepy and proud when things looked up for him and went his way personally and on the field. We get a pretty good overview of Jackie Robinson with some of his early baseball life in the minor leagues with the Montreal Royals, his personal life, negotiating with Dodger management thru Branch Rickey, and his interacting with players on his team and other teams. For more on Jackie Robinson check out Wikipedia and you will discover a lot more about him. A lot more.Chadwick Boseman was a good choice to play Jackie Robinson and he did a very good job. Harrison Ford must have loved every minute playing Branch Rickey and from that performance we come to realize that Rickey was indeed a great man. Great job. The rest of the cast performed well. This biography went by so quick it was over before you could say 'Jackie Robinson.' HA! That's how good this was. Kudos. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff only and not much of it.",9,0,1,2 September 2013
Argo," Tension, Suspense and a Terrific Cast win this one
","This is based upon a true story. An American film crew posing as a Canadian film crew is to make a movie in Iran, but the real purpose is to free 6-American diplomats hiding out in the Canadian Ambassador's house. The CIA knows that the Iranians will soon discover that 6-diplomats are missing from the American Embassy staff so time is of the essence to save their lives. This movie works because there is tension and suspense throughout, and this tension is transmitted to the viewing audience. I was riveted to the screen. Even though we know the eventual outcome we are tense and apprehensive anyway. The pacing is perfect and the shots alternating between the 6-diplomats and the CIA provided a sense of urgency. This is a tribute to director Ben Affleck and the entire cast. Hey, if we were apprehensive, think how the real 6-diplomats actually felt when this was happening to them. The portrayals by the actors in here helped sell this. And, the people behind the scenes trying to free these diplomats were on the same page even though they knew how dangerous the plan was. The entire cast was perfect and this includes the actors portraying the Iranians, but 3-actors stand out: Bryan Cranston (as Jack O'Donnell - CIA chief); Alan Arkin (as Lester Siegel - Director); and Ben Affleck (as Tony Mendez who came up with the film plan). I was impressed with Affleck's portrayal of Mendez who was most calm during everything. Was Mendez really this way? No matter as everything worked. Hey, I bought it. Was everything told and was this the way everything really happened? No matter as we were given plausible scenarios and convincing dialogues and the plan worked. There may have been some poetic license near the end when the 6-diplomats and Mendez were on the SwissAir plane racing down the runway just ahead of the Iranians in a jeep chasing the plane. The Iranians knew the missing 6-diplomats were on the plane. I am reminded of Hannibal from the A-Team (TV show) saying he loved it when a plan came together. Or something like that. After some of the credits at the end, we hear President Carter talk about this incident. Was this good enough to win the Oscar for Best Picture? Yes. And, Affleck for Best Director? Yes. And Allen Arkin for Best Supporting Actor? Yes. (you done now?) Yes. Thank you, Canada. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff only and not much of it.",9,0,1,20 February 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Very Good
","Khan ( Benedict Cumberbatch) makes his appearance known by destroying a library archive and also Starfleet headquarters. It is up to Captain James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and his crew to hot-wire the Enterprise and run down Khan to finish him off.Okay, folks here we go again. Remember this is a reboot, it's not your father's Star Trek. Yeah, I know: tough getting used to.This was very good despite some criticisms. Actually, too much CGI, and Special Effects, - and they were terrific - but that's the trend these days. We still don't like the relationship between Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) as it's just too forced and no chemistry comes out of it. Spock's explanations are cookie-cutter spiels that we have heard way too often. Nothing new. And, when there is an emergency at hand he'll go on for 2-minutes of why or why not and quote regulations. Yes, the old Spock (Nimoy) did the same thing, but did it quicker. See? This is the perfect example of why we like Capt Kirk who runs on gut feelings and not many words. Old Mr. Sulu (George Takei) always said, 'Aye, Captain' but the new Mr Sulu (John Cho) says, 'Yes, sir.' We like 'Aye, Captain' better. What else did you not like? I did not like that the head of Starfleet Command, Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller), goes rogue. We like having confidence in the men at the top. This was uncalled for. Dr. McCoy um ' Bones' (Karl Urban) played his part exactly like the old Bones (Deforest Kelley) would have. In other words, he complained about everything, but he needed to be more animated. Next time, okay? One day we'd like to see Bruce Greenwood get more screen time. He played Christopher Pike, the first Captain of the Enterprise.Breaths of fresh air: Scotty (Simon Pegg) who said the same thing the old Scotty (Doohan) would say, but the New Scotty has better facial expressions. The other breath of fresh air was Benedict Clumberbatch. We enjoyed his presence, commanding voice and superior delivery. Great job. If any of you saw the movie: ENEMY MINE, then you will enjoy Captain Kirk partnering up with Khan for a brief mission. Say, what?Still very good, even though we get a lot of redundancy. Hey, let's move on and assume the audience knows the characters in and out. Okay? Stop repeating the same things over and over again.Old Spock (Leonard Nimoy) makes an appearance giving guidance to New Spock. This needs to stop or just bring the old crew back and we'd all be the happier for that. Bringing the Old Spock back was not necessary. Nice to see him, but still: not necessary. Chris Pine is a very good Captain Kirk. And, this is hard to believe, but at times he almost looked like William Shatner. Like I said: hard to believe. And, guess what are back? Tribbles. Yes, you read that correctly, and they play an important part later on. Hard to believe, I know. All in all, this was very good. The plot is a good one when you hear Khan spell it all out for Captain Kirk.I know I have to get over comparing new Apples to old Apples. Hey, I 'm working on it. It's just not easy. These reboots bring out the 'yeah,Â…Â… but ' in me. I'm working on it. Â…Â….. (8/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only the S-word was heard at times.

"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Good Lite Drama
","Cal (Carell) learns his wife Emily (Moore) wants a divorce from what he thought was a happy marriage. He meets Jacob (Gosling) who changes Cal into a ladies man, sort of. I thought this was going to be another lame chick flick with no-laughs, dirty sex talk, raunchy language, no clever sight gags along with silly and stupid things that are mandatory in a Hollywood comedy. And, I was foaming at the mouth just thinking about how scathing a review I would write. I couldn't wait for this to be over to start writing. Well, I was wrong. This had none of that except the no-laughs part still held true (and, one F-bomb was uttered). This is not a comedy although billed as such. This is lite-drama and was well acted. Quite enjoyable.And, it got complicated: Cal is getting a divorce from Emily who is seeing David Lindhagen (Bacon) at work; Jessica (Tipton), the baby sitter, is in love with Cal; Jacob teaches Cal how to pick up women now that Cal is single; Cal's 13-yr old son Robbie (Bobo) is in love with 17-yr old Jessica; Cal picks up Kate (Tormei) who is also Robbie's teacher. Emily is surprised that Cal knows Kate and has dated her. Then Jacob says he has found true love, for the first time, and Cal is impressed until he discovers that Jacob is in love with Hannah (Stone). Now, Cal is angry because he knows about Jacob and how he behaves around women. Then Jessica's father Bernie (Lynch) is shown naked pictures Jessica's mother found in Jessica's bureau that were of Jessica that Jessica took to interest Cal in her (Remember Jessica is in love with Cal. Keep up). Got it?Then they all meet, somehow, in the back yard of Cal's (now Emily's) house and a fight breaks out. Cops are called who tell everyone if they are going to fight, do it in the house and keep it all in the family. This was the closest we came to some actual humor. I saw many places for good lines, some comedic facial expressions and some rather good sight gags, but none showed up and I wasn't consulted. Just the normal stuff as I described above. Kind of like a slice of life within a family that went off center for a while.The name David Lindhagen was mentioned many times in the movie and acted almost like a punch line in some conversations. There is a nice little surprise regarding Hannah. If you watch the movie you will see what I mean and be surprised too. Can't tell you now as that will spoil everything. I have told you most things that you will discover anyway as you go along, but keep in mind that it's in the telling that the story unfolds and you don't know everything. Yet.Violence: Yes, the fight in the back yard. Sex: Yes, under covers in a darkened room You see nothing. Nudity: No. Jessica took nude photos of herself, but we didn't see them. Language: One F-bomb was heard. About 20 A-Holes was heard too.",7,0,2,13 November 2011
Public Enemies," It was okay, but long
","John Dillinger (Depp) is robbing banks and the Feds have a hard time stopping himI don't know why this movie wasn't called Public Enemy No 1 as it was all about Dillinger. Yes, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd were mentioned but this was all about Dillinger who was called Public Enemy No 1 by the Feds. This movie also showed the beginnings of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover.It was okay. The best parts were when Dillinger spoke and we wished he had more dialogue. We hung on every word and when he was courting his girl, Billie (Cotillard) we heard some good dialogue. The entire cast performed well.The story didn't explain Frank Nitti's involvement although his character was in a couple scenes that sounded important but were vague, so we never knew anything. What was missing that could have made this a better movie? Two things. First, his men didn't talk about him in glowing terms among themselves or to others. That would have enhanced the legend. And, second, if we had seen Dillinger pretend he was a bank alarm systems salesman while casing out some banks, that would have helped as well. Not to glorify Dillinger, but the general feeling among the people of the United States, at that time, was that he was getting back at the banks, which they hated. Remember everyone was just coming out of a depression and it was generally felt the bankers caused it. We are talking 1933. So if Dillinger robbed a bank, the bankers deserved it. A breakfast table conversation in awe of Dillinger would have been correct and funny, in a way. Would those two things have made the movie even longer? No. All they would have had to do was to cut down on some of the shootings. That big shooting scene in the woods when the Feds thought they had Dillinger went on for too long, the scenes were were too dark and no one could tell who was shooting at anyone. It took a scene later on when Dillinger was caring for his wounds that we knew he had gottten away. One of these days the powers that be will realize that Johnny Depp is so much like a Brando in that he becomes the role he is playing. He is that good. But, on the whole, the movie was okay. Could have used more humor too. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Some GDIs were only heard.",7,2,3,17 December 2009

And, John Bennett and 'Ted' became lifelong friends. If parents are thinking this is a cute teddy bear story, they are in for the biggest surprise of their lives. This teddy bear story is laced with most foul language, sexual innuendos (and much was outright blatant) drinking and drug use. And, most of this came from the mouth of Ted. Nothing in here is remotely funny and really, it's just embarrassing to watch. This could have been funny and a real treat, but the language and other stuff mentioned above killed it.

Just Go with It," Actually Funny. Well Done
","Plastic Surgeon Danny (Sandler) picks up women by wearing a wedding band. Then, he meets someone he really likes, Palmer (Decker), and she won't have anything to do with a married man. He tells her he is getting a divorce and she buys it. Katherine (Aniston) agrees to be the fake divorcing wife and her kids also play along and the lies keep getting bigger and bigger. There was no end to them.I kept saying that most Hollywood comedies have their funny stuff up front in the beginning and then later anything comical is forgotten for the rest of the movie. Well, I have to qualify that statement. Oh, it's still true, but not for an Adam Sandler movie. He has a way to keep the yuks coming throughout. There is nothing overdone, silly, stupid (ok, well there were a couple silly things, but like I said in a Hollywood comedy silly and stupid are mandatory) or telegraphed where they become tedious and not funny in most other comedies. But this doesn't happen in a Adam Sandler movie. Many of his contemporaries should take note, especially the ones I keep saying should be selling used cars. And, Sandler even hires some of them for his movies and still they don't learn anything? Bummer.Sometimes a good comedy is based upon a lie, that keeps evolving and funny things can come out of subsequent misunderstandings, and half-truths. That is an old and true comedic formula and Sandler knows it, and he has enough sense to keep the funny things going on all the way through. I had to laugh out loud many times. Just had to do it. Take for example one of the kids who agrees to go along with the lie. She wants to project an English accent. So Danny says he wants to hear it first. So she goes, 'Heeeeeeellllo' in a very exaggerated rather high English tone. Immediately, Danny says, 'No.' I was almost on the floor. Pure gold. I am quite leery of Hollywood comedies, but what kept me was the scene in the doctor's office when a woman came in who had an accident with one of her implants (it deflated). The conversation between Danny and his assistant Catherine sealed the deal for me and it was quite good. Yes, a little on the risquÃ© side, but funny nevertheless. Hey, risquÃ© can be funny if it's done right and this was. Hey, I just went with it. HA!The entire support cast performed well and Brooklyn Decker may become a very good actress. She held her own. You may have seen her in the recent SI Swimsuit issue. This was actually funny and better than the usual-not-funny Hollywood comedies. Well done.

Terminator Salvation," When is this going to end?
","John Connor (Bale) is again fighting the machines who want to eliminate all human life. He meets Marcus (Worthington) and Connor is not sure if Marcus is friend or foe from the future. It's easy to get lost in this story, and we constantly have to figure out who is the father of who even though the father is Kyle (Yelchin) a teenager and the son is John Connor, an adult; and where is Sara Connor?, and are we in the present or the future? Of course, I am making it more complicated than it is. Or am I?The acting by all was good, and there is a lot of CGI in this and it's all good too; but it takes up more than half of the movie and it's practically the same over and over again. Arnie was smart to get out when he did. Gets tedious after a time especially since most of the scenes are filmed in the dark. It's not even scary anymore. So much for date night stuff. Might have to check that Scary Movie thing out again. Also, the Marcus character and the Connor character look too much alike. Well, kind of. Why do they do that? Before I said Arnie was smart to get out when he did, but did you notice that another updated Terminator Model looked exactly like Arnie? Wasn't on the screen long. So you missed it. No big deal.I really thought this was going to put an end to the war with the machines. Wrong again. I went through BattleStar Galactica with the machines, and that ended. Or did it?The only sequel that outshone all that went before was the Die Hard series. This movie left it open to another sequel and I have had enough. When is this going to end? This one needs to go away. This is torture. I'm ready to let the machines win. I really wish the TV show The Sara Connor Chronicles would come back. I miss Summer Glau, the good looking machine who plays a good machine who protects John Connor, the young one. That gets complicated too, but it is preferred. (What did you say? She's not a machine?

Juno," Made for TV movie
","A High School girl, Juno (Page), gets pregnant and decides to give the baby to a childless couple.This had the feel of The Wonder Years (TV) show. But, the narrator (Juno) becomes pregnant and that could have meant a lot of possibilities, but they never materialized and the writers took the safe road and not much was going to happen in here. It was a nice slice of life without the complications about a teenage girl who becomes pregnant that would have been conjured up. No tension, no parental battles, no input from the father (Cera) other than to say it was up to Juno to do what she thought best. There is a little hitch in the process, but it is quickly worked out. Oh, and BTW, The Wonder Years TV show had a lot of complications. Maybe the writers should have watched some episodes. The acting was fine by the entire cast, but the writers had a lot of fun making a 16-year old girl produce dialog and wisdom that were beyond her years. Was this why this movie was nominated for Best Picture? The little music diddies were good, but they were short lived and the one at the end of the movie was barely audible. There were some clever lines, but not LOL ones. On the whole, this movie was nice, safe and really didn't have to be made, and really didn't have to be nominated for Best Picture either. But, it was. Didn't win. Ellen Page was nominated for Best Actress. She was okay, but I didn't see an Oscar performance in her. Didn't win. The Director was nominated for Best Director. Why? What was so special about his directing? AnywayÂ…Â….didn't win. And, lastly, the movie was nominated for Original Screenplay. Originality?

Too many plots kill this. The acting went way down and this is surprising, but there it was in front of me. Terrible, terrible, and terrible again.The stunts and CGI were good as always, but they had a tendency to go on too long. This reminded me of the director who did the Fantastic Four, with the Silver Surfer. Was it the same guy? Will have to check. I mention this because the scenes where they do the acting thing seemed to be the same, most scenes without background noise and this has me believing they were rehearsing lines.

Midnight in Paris," Excellent, Engaging and Very Creative
","Gil (Wilson) accompanies his girl friend Inez (McAdams) and her parents to Paris, France. All want to see everything, taste wine everywhere and go here and there except Gil, who is writing a novel. He wants to recapture the essence of Paris of the 1920s by going for walks and is picked up by a 1920s Peugeot taxi and is greeted by F. Scott Fitzgerald and another time by t.s. eliot. Through them Gil is introduced to Hemingway, Monet, James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Cole Porter, Picasso, Djuna Barnes, and Alice B. Toklas. How good is that?]Woody Allen would probably have starred in this but he felt a younger man who had a whining voice like his was needed and Owen Wilson was perfect. And, he was right.This is the most creative movie I have seen since Forest Gump and Inkheart.The movie starts with some very beautiful scenes of Paris: parks, gardens, the Arch, the Eiffel tower, street scenes with and without it raining. Allen took his time with this and we are all grateful for it. Very nice.As we get into the story we are not sure how Gil transfers into the past. We see the taxi and Gil gets in and then he is in the 1920s. At first we think he may have been dreaming,or like Alice who found a rabbit hole, and, well we really don' t know the answer to that one. That's Woody Allen's secret. But, there Gil is hob-nobbing with all the great writers and painters of the time. Funny that they never mention the different clothes he wears. At some point he does say he is from the year 2010, and that doesn't seem to elicit any real emotion from anyone as they accept it. He does give Zelda Fitzgerald a valium to keep her calm to not commit suicide; and again the valium is questioned but accepted.The only good funny line I found in here was when Hemmingway asks Gil if he hunts. Gil replies, 'only for bargains.' But, it is Adrianna (Cotillard) who realizes she is in the 1920s but prefers the 1890s where she and Gil are now in the Moulin Rouge and she introduces Gil to Toulouse-Lautrec, Matisse, and Gauguin. Is it that we find the past more exciting to live in than our present and is it that we don't appreciate what we have in our present? Or are we too quick to forget about the past? Am glad Gil didn't meet any real philosophers as I would really be lost.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Not Very Entertaining
","In the 1970s, George Smiley (Gary Oldman) comes out of retirement to find the mole in MI-5 British Intelligence, (also known as The Circus), who is upsetting covert operations. Sound easy enough?The hype over this story was staggering. It is said the story, as presented, is an adult (read Intellectual) version of Ian Flemming and Robert Ludlum spy stories. That sure sounds like Zzzzzzzzz time to me. I just had the feeling I would be looking at frozen facial expressions for long periods of time. The more of those frozen expressions, the more professional critics call it art, intelligent, and thought provoking. Keep in mind these critics only talk among themselves, for themselves in a language only they understand. Also, we in the audience like to gather clues, but here we had no idea if clues were presented. They probably were but the dialogues were all so low key who knew what a clue was if clue was presented? No one seemed excited about anything so we didn't pay too much attention. Hence, we missed a lot of clues. Who knew?So here's the thing if you want to enjoy this movie: The mole is someone in the inner circle of the Circus. That is all you really need to know. Everything else is a distraction like a magician who misdirects you. Hey, I didn't give anything away. The problem with knowing where the mole is still doesn't help as we know absolutely nothing about these people. Nothing. So how are we to know about clues when it comes to them? If there was some sort of character development for these people we might have had a chance. Is the mole Tinker, or Tailor or Soldier? OK, so now you know where the title of this comes from. Does that help? No. In the last 20-minutes Smiley puts names to Tinker, Tailor and Soldier. Does that help? No. For most of us, the most recognizable person within the Circus is Colin Firth as Bill Haydon. Is he the mole? (I honestly hoped he would say at some point: you know, I used to be king -- Little joke here). Perhaps the book told more about the people who made up the Circus, but it didn't happen within this. And, yes, a little humor would have gone a long way to a better entertainment rating. Didn't happen. This was not entertaining. This was tedious and we kept hoping Smiley would key in on someone to get this over with. The problem was we couldn't read Smiley even a little. How do you read a frozen face? And, it wasn't just him. There were frozen or poker faces all around. And, yes, I was correct. I spent most of this movie watching frozen facial expressions. Not good. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

Fast & Furious 6," Pure Entertainment
","Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) are asked by Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) to stop Shaw (Luke Evans) the leader of a criminal crew of skilled mercenary drivers who are acquiring parts to build a powerful gun to be sold to terrorists. Shaw needs one last chip to complete the gun. If successful Dom's crew will get a full pardon from their illegal exploits during Fast and Furious 5. I was told that F&F 6 was the best one of all the sequels, And, after seeing this I believe they are correct. Of course it was all the vehicle chases that made it for me. What I saw was almost unbelievable. I don't know how much CGI was in evidence, but I do know that over 70 stunt men were used (I counted them in the credits) so I would venture to say these stunts with vehicles were fantastic.You will see some things that you will have you saying, 'that's impossible.' Maybe so, but this is excellent entertainment. Suspend logic and enjoy yourself. The photography and editing were incredible to say the least. As you watch you may have wished your couch came with seat belts. Kudos all around. You go to these kinds of movies to see the vehicle chases, not for the acting which was okay for this is type of movie. For the most part , there is not a lot of dialogue in here. Oh, and for your viewing pleasure the director saw fit to throw in an Army tank and a big cargo plane. Wait until you see how they are used. Wow! This just gets better and better. So if you like car chases with vehicles and people flying thru the air, and explosions this is for you. Hey, I was entertained. Yes, there is a story here too, but it plays second fiddle and there is a twist you may not see coming. Also, Dom finds out that his former love interest, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), is alive and working for Shaw (Say What???). How can this be? Dom needs to find out. Oh, when it's all over keep your seat belt on because after many of the credits run, you will see that F&F 7 is in the works and you won't believe who will be in it. Stay tuned. (8/10)Violence: Yes.

The Expendables," Give us a break
","A group of mercenaries take a job on a South American island to overthrow dictator General Garza (Zayas), but they find something else is going on there. If you want to see many of your Action Heroes in one place this is the movie for you. And, if you add Karate fights, car/truck chases, explosions and gunfire for about 95% of the time, this is the movie for you. And, if you like seeing (or not seeing) most of the fighting, shooting and killing actions that occur in the dark, this is the movie for you. Give us a break. This was like an action video game. The acting and dialogue were pretty good what little there was, however, the movie seemed more intent on getting back to fighting/killing and blowing things up; and the explosions were spectacular. But, like too much CGI in Transformers, too much hand-to-hand fighting, vehicle chases, gunfire, killings and explosions do not a good movie make. And, since most of the action was in dimly lighted areas we really didn't care who was doing what to whom. The movie's Continuity Person had an easy job in here. In fact, we didn't care about any of the characters regardless of the times when no killing actions were on the screen. We just didn't care.What did we like? The car/truck chases appeared to be actual stunts and they were spectacular and some of the best we have ever seen. We liked Eric Roberts and why don't we see him in movies where he is the good guy? Yes, many actors prefer the bad guy role, but too often we see Eric Roberts in a bad guy role and we want that changed. He is always Oscar Worthy and one of the best actors Hollywood has ever had. There is one thing the movie got absolutely right, the title. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, but not too many F-bombs",2,1,5,25 November 2010
Knocked Up," Rude, crude yet funny in places
","After getting a promotion at the TV station where she works, Alison (Heigl) celebrates and goes home with jobless Ben (Rogan) and is impregnated by him. Will she keep the baby, will she dump Ben, inquiring minds ask?There are a lot of explicit sexual content, and F-bombs exploding all over the place and yet, the funny lines and actions do not come from any of that. I found them all to be offensive, embarrassing and annoying and the story would not have suffered if all of that were left out. No, the funny stuff comes from everything other than that. There are some good lines, good acting, and timely facial expressions that are the funny stuff. Okay, okay, when she is in the process of delivering the baby and having a hard time of it, there is a lot of anger, rudeness, crudeness and uninhibited language spewing forth from Alison and the scene was laugh-out-loud funny I have to admit. This movie showcases Katherine Heigl's acting ranges as she goes through a myriad of emotions and all are quite believable and you care for her. If you didn't care for her then there is no point in watching the rest of the movie. Both Ben and Alison take the pregnancy seriously, but it is Alison that you care for and hope all turns out well for her. Ms Heigl is so beautiful that you are vaguely aware there are others in the scene as you cannot take your eyes off of her. And, this woman can act. Make no mistake about that. Yes, to some she is eye-candy. But eye-candy with a lot of acting talent. Oh, and she has a nice laugh too. Now, why was this movie made? To let us see Ms Heigl in something other than Grey's Anatomy TV show, of course. Silly question.Bad language and misguided sexual content aside, the performances of the rest of the cast were excellent.

The Book Thief," Well Told Story and a Great History Lesson
","It's 1938, Nazi Germany. Liesel's (Sophie Nelisse) mother sends her to live with a foster couple as she can no longer care for her. Liesel steals her first book at the grave site when her brother dies on the trip. The book: The Gravedigger's Handbook. (Does something like that actually exist?) Liesel likes Hans (Geoffrey Rush) who she calls Pappa. She is wary of Rosa (Emily Watson) who she calls Mamma, but considers her like a thunderstorm as she is always rumbling. In time this new family takes in Max, a Jew who is in hiding from the Germans, and they know the consequences if they get caught hiding him. This is quite a history lesson especially for the youth of today as they have no clue about WWII and the German attempts at world domination. We see the family living in fear all the time. We can conclude that most families during this time had no real love for the German government, but they complied as the government expected them to. They all lived in fear. The story is compelling as we follow Liesel and her need for reading. When she brings the laundry to the Bergermeisters's house, she is shown the huge library and the Bergermeister's wife lets her select books to read. I bet you are thinking how Liesel can figure out how to steal all these books when she is overcome with the quantity there. Just a thought as it ran across my mind. Later, when the Burgermeister himself catches Liesel in the library with his wife, he forbids Liesel to come again with the laundry and he's not too happy with his wife. Later, Liesel sneaks into the Burgermeister's library and steals (she claims she is only borrowing) various books and reads them to Max. Her school-friend, Rudy, calls her the Book Thief. Sophie Nelisse was the perfect choice to play Liesel. She has that ability that shows constant wariness, alertness and the necessary fear of something bad about to happen. You can see all this in her eyes. She gave quite a performance. Kudos. Geoffrey Rush should have received a nomination for his role as Hans, a house painter, who refused to join the Nazi Party. The chemistry with Liesel was pure gold. The story is narrated, in parts, by DEATH (Roger Allam) and he says everyone will die and there is no use fighting it. His comments at the end of the movie fill in many gaps.English is spoken with German accents. Sub-titles are shown when German songs are sung by the Hitler Youth. This was not a true story but the impact of the war on German families and their children is quite dramatic and probably worse then what we see in this movie. Yes, this is a movie the youth should watch and it should be mandatory in schools. (9/10)Violence; Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,1,4,9 May 2014
The Town," Very Good, Suspenseful
","Doug (Affleck) and his gang rob banks and armored cars in the town of Charlestown just outside Boston, MA. They are efficient and leave no clues for the police. All is good until Doug falls for Claire (Hall), one of the hostages on one of the jobs. The only bit of truth in this film is that Charlestown has the reputation of having its banks robbed more than any other town in the country. Some say it's a family tradition handed down. Ben Affleck directed this movie, and maybe he has found his true calling as he did an excellent job. Hey, we might have another Clint Eastwood on our hands. Who knew?With any movie where the setting is in the Boston area, one can expect to hear the Boston accent, but here you hear it and not hear it as sometimes the characters forget to use it. Kind of funny. Why bother in the first place? The audience really doesn't care about accents. Well, unless they are over the top.This was better than I expected. The pace was good and there was the suspense needed for this type of story. The acting was first rate by all, and the stunts were kind of amazing. No CGI, just actual police car chases which were right on. I couldn't help but notice how narrow the streets of Charlestown are. Charlestown was used as the filming location. Violence: Yes.

Not to worry. This was not as scary as advertised. In fact the whole twist was given away early on and no, I won't tell what it is, but there are clues that practically hit you over your head. I am certain you will figure it out as I did and I am slow with these things. The acting by all is very good. I just wish the story was better. It was not, but the opportunities were certainly there. For all the hype that came with this movie, there was no suspense, tension and you really don't care about the characters. You'll see. Still, it will hold your interest even though you have figured it all out. Something, eh?Oh, I did watch it on a bright, sunny afternoon. Turns out, I didn't have to. Not scary. Violence: Yes.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Pleasantly Surprised as this was very good
","Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) is now in the present day (he was in a suspended animation from 1945) has been told that Shield has been compromised and to trust no one. Hydra is the organization that wants to take over the whole world giving all freedom, but induced by fear - so no freedoms for us, you see. Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) are the only ones he can count on. Can they destroy Hydra? Inquiring Minds want to know. I took this out for the CGI and found that this has a pretty good story, great cinematography, very good acting, great fighting/action stunts whether CGI or real and a pacing that kept me engaged all the way through. Yes, a lot of CGI and other stunts but there was time to get to know the story, and characters. Kudos. In the beginning, Steve Rogers jumps out of a plane. Someone asks, 'Did he have a parachute on?' No was the answer. How good is that? Thought so. The stunts whether CGI or real were fantastic and didn't run too long like most CGI in other movies. Loud sounds accompanied many stunts and were spot on. Of course, I jumped involuntarily, of course, at the appropriate times. Didn't plan on it - just happened. You may jump at times, too. Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson were very good. I think Scarlett Johansson could be considered the best Woman Actor on the planet. She is exceptional in everything. Hey, Clint Eastwood, take a look at the female side and let's hear from you. Supporting cast members Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury were great. In case you are wondering, Jackson didn't pontificate and kept his voice conversational. I thought I saw him struggling with that. HA!There is somewhat a surprise regarding the one known as The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). And you probably thought Captain America was the Winter Soldier. Not so. But, truth be told I thought so too. One thing did bother me a little. Alexander Pierce says to Nick Fury, at one moment, in the beginning that Fury needs to get Iron Man to visit his daughter's party. Why mention Iron Man if he, Iron Man, wasn't to be used in here? Hey, the whole Avenger Crew could have been used. Didn't happen. Stan Lee has a short cameo.After the credits run the first time, stay with the DVD as there are scenes that purport to show us the upcoming sequel for the next time. You didn't think this was over, did you?All in all a very good enjoyable action movie. Kudos. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,0,1,17 September 2014
Life of Pi," Engaging. Impressive. Riveting.
","When the Narrator of the story is in the title, you can be sure the Narrator will not die. Pi (Suraj Sharma) is the Narrator. He and his family are on their way to Canada to sell their family zoo. A storm comes up and wrecks the ship and the only survivors are: Pi, a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a Bengal Tiger (so named Richard Parker due to a cargo manifest order mix-up when the family bought him). Peter Parker was already taken. HA! After the Tiger eats the other animals, Pi decides he needs to teach the Tiger to fish or he will be eaten too. Wait, that's not right. What to do? What to do? Well, there is only one solution left and Pi hopes Richard Parker has enough intelligence to catch on. Now, getting the heavy stuff out of the way, there are 2-stories in here and which will you believe? The mystical one: a tiger and boy on a life boat; or a more believable one where Pi's mother, a seaman, and cook are in the life boat with Pi? Much of this has to do with a belief in God or having faith as the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) unfolds the story to a writer who was told he would believe in God when he heard Pi's story. Okay, good choice. You selected the boy and the tiger. Once they are in the boat together, there is nothing but tension, wariness, anger, fear and really too much suspense. But this never drags. It is like you are Pi and watching out for the tiger every minute of the day and night; and you don't dare rest â€“ and even though we are watching from a comfortable couch, we cannot rest either. We are riveted as is Pi. Yes, there is much CGI in here but everything is so well done, we are still afraid to sleep. We see Pi put together a make-shift raft away from the boat attached with a tether. Now Pi is able to get some restÂ…Â…and we try too. We see storms with very high waves, lightning, sharks, whales, flying fish come upon Pi and the tiger and even though Pi, as a very young boy, experimented with Catholicism (even asked to be baptized), and Islam it was the Hindu god Vishnu who he thanked for saving them time and time again. Hey, you go with what you know.The cinematography and photography are simply outstanding. Did you go with what you know when you selected your choice as I asked above? Do you know why the Tiger didn't look back at Pi when they landed on the sand? When you know the answer to that, you then know which story was the true one. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Ocean's Thirteen," Tedious and too much to watch
","The Ocean (Clooney) plan is to take down Willy Bank (Pacino) who forces his one-time casino owner-partner (Gould) to give everything up to Bank.There is simply too much going on in this movie to follow in an enjoyable way. It reminded me of a Mission Impossible TV show or Movie where the details are the most important thing going. Here there are too many details and I got lost trying to fit everything in place so I just didn't pay any attention to them after a while and hoped for some face-time with the all-star cast. Didn't happen. The stars ran into and out of the scenes at breakneck speed, mumbled a few lines and we were on to another scene for more of the same. I knew what they were trying to do, bankrupt Willy Bank, and I suppose that is all you need to know. But, the mumbling, dashing in and out of scenes caused a loss in continuity for me.. I didn't care if Willy Bank got his. So to me, this was a complete waste of star-power and story. I think the director had a time limit on how long each scene would take to be shot and he beat his schedule all the way through. Director: 1. Audience: 0. Then when everything was in place and Bank was about to lose all, I didn't care when all the now-rigged games made winners of everyone playing. I didn't get any joy out of that. So what was the point? I felt nothing. When you watch a movie you should feel something. Okay, well I did. I felt this was a tedious and boring movie where a lot of star-power was thoroughly wasted, and the story suffered because of too many details.Let's hope there is no Ocean's Fourteen.Violence:No, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No",2,21,34,23 November 2007
We Are Marshall," Very Impressive
","After a plane crash kills all of the 1970 Marshall Football team and coaches, Marshall University tries to put its football program back in order to help heal the town and to honor those who died.This was well done, not as sappy as I imagined it would be. Maybe we are too far removed from that time in 1970 when the plane carrying the Marshall Football Team crashed and left no survivors. Maybe this movie should have been made earlier to have had more of an impact. Maybe.Still, I believe that as Marshall University put its program back to help heal the town and to honor those who died, this movie accomplishes the same. This is well told, and well acted. I was never a fan of college football, but I am now and intend to follow the Marshall football team's play. Yes, I know that the struggle was difficult in those early years and it took some time for them to be good and win some National titles and the town sort of healed, And, every year at the moment of the crash, the whole town stops everything for a few moments to remember.That next year after the crash Marshall University lobbied the NCAA to use Freshman to play at Varsity level and that was approved eventually. I believe they won 2-games that year and considering they were made up of mostly Freshmen, that is huge and a credit to them and to the coaches, and to the town that supported them. There were also a few seniors who were injured who didn't go on that flight.Have I given away too much here? Probably, but it all becomes new to you when you see the movie. It is that good, but you knew that by the fact that the movie was made in the first place, that things would turn out all right. But the town still mourns every year so all isn't 100 per cent right and never will be.Violence:Yes, football violence, Sex: No, Nudity:No, Language: No",9,2,2,15 December 2007
Pacific Rim," A CGI-fest
","Monsters known as Kaiju come from a deep rift in the Pacific Ocean and wreck havoc over the entire planet. World governments get together to build giant robots called Jaegers to combat the Kaiju. Inside the robots are 2-people who act as left-sided brain and right-sided brain because one person alone is not capable of handling the Jaeger. The ultimate goal is to close the rift and be rid of the Kaiju. There is no other way to say it: this is a CGI-fest. There are some acting scenes and they are pretty good by all. What was most annoying were the 2-scientists whose constant bickering almost made me align myself on the side of the Kaiju. Hey, I said 'almost.' The 2-scientists Charlie Day as Dr. Geiszler and Burn Gorman as Dr Gottlieb could possibly start their own stand-up comedy team except for one thing: they weren't funny and were highly annoying. They could have been handled in a better way, but weren't and this goes to prove that comedy is hard to do. And, to make matters even worse they talked so fast no one could possibly understand what they said. The hero is Charlie Hunnam (never heard of him before) as Becket and his love interest is Rinko Kikuchi (never heard of her before either) as Mako. They form the team to go into the ultimate Jaeger to defeat the Kaiju and to try to drop a nuclear bomb into the rift and close the bridge to upper earth. Idris Elba is Stacker Pentecost but is referred to as Marshall, at times, in the movie and he does a credible job as the person in charge of everything. Ron Pearlman as Hannibal Chau was in here and it is not clear what his purpose was. Maybe most of his scenes were cut and we were left with wondering why he was cast.Most of the movie is CGI with battle scenes after battle scenes and they are very good, but when it goes on for too long, too often, I tend to go into La La land when that happens. This movie is also in 3-D but the DVD I had wasn't. Bummer.If you are a CGI Nerd, this is for you. If the battle scenes were shortened , a better rating would have been given. They just go on for toooooo long. Hey, I'm yawning here. Can't you tell? But, here's the thing: Let's say the bomb works (and, I'm not telling) and the bridge is closed, the Kaiju would still be down there waiting for another opportunity to come up again. The movie did indicate that the Kaiju were not acting on instinct, but were commanded by higher-ups in their species. Would you like to live on a planet where this scenario exists? Huh? I know some will say it's only a movie. Right? (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",5,0,2,17 October 2013
Gone Baby Gone," Forgetaboutit
","Private detective Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) takes on a missing baby case and has a really big decision to make. Can you guess? Ever notice that movies that have Boston as a setting have the characters use the really deep Boston accent in the beginning and then later on everyone forgetsaboutit? Huh?Also, ever notice that in his early movie days Marlon Brando took on roles whereby it took some getting used to his speech patterns? Well, I don't know if Casey Affleck will attain Brando status, but something needs to be addressed as his words slide unintelligibly sideways out of his mouth. Yes, I had to use the Rewind on the DVD to get what he said. Then I got tired of that and said the heck with it and I just put my ears into SLURRY mode and made out so-so. Not good. At this point Mr. Affleck is not a Marlon Brando or even a James Dean if anyone remembers him.The production was okay, but the dark night scenes were really too dark to a point I would rather have the camera focus on someone we can see sitting somewhere listening to all the commotion and reacting to those sounds than to try to figure out who is on the screen and what is he doing etcÂ….well you get the idea. That would help eliminate eye-strain.Amy Ryan was up for Best Supporting actress and did not get it. Why was she nominated in the first place? Her performance was okay but we see this character all the time on cop shows on TV. Nothing new or exciting here. The performances of the rest of the cast were good, but when Titus Welliver (Lionel McCready) was on screen I kept getting distracted by his overly bushy mustache. I wanted to pull it off, brush crumbs off it, put a match to it. It was that bushy.I think the only time we will see more of Morgan Freeman is when someone does a documentary about him. His screen appearances are nothing but GOLD but we always only see bits of him in movies. Why?The story was good, lost some continuity in places and had two anti-climatic scenes (when I thought it was over, it was not). However, the movie had one big flaw in it: Casey Affleck is not a Leading Man and that is the reason this is a forgettable movie. Sad to say but he had no chemistry with anyone he was in any scene with. Enough said. But, to be fair he was better in the Assassination of Jesse James film.Almost forgot. The title could have been better.Violence:Yes; Sex:No; Nudity:No; Language: Yes, and the movie seems to bring in some really nasty terms too.",2,12,22,1 March 2008
21 Jump Street," Need New Rating for 'raunchy comedies'
","Two Police Academy graduates go undercover to a High School to determine the source of drugs being sold to the students. Here we go again with Jonah Hill trying to be a comedian and it still doesn't work for him. Jonah Hill was Oscar nominated for his role in Moneyball and he did a great job. Do people who saw and liked Moneyball think they will see the same kind of Jonah Hill's character in these comedies? His Moneyball character (shy, quiet, intelligent, low-key funny, unsuspecting) is his strength and not this raunch. Is he looking at this type of comedy as a promotion?To compound things, the dialogues by all are riddled with foul language, crude and vulgar sex talk . The music had some raunch too and there are some raunchy sight gags that appear for no apparent reason. Things calm down quite a bit in the second half, but the language is still there. The car chases and gun fights make a Chinese Fire Drill look organized. What has happened to us? These alleged comedies are rife with all the above and they are never funny. Do we go to these movies to see if real comedy is coming back or do we really like all the raunch thrown at us? Keep in mind that the promos for these 'comedies' never show this raunch, and although some promo clips are, indeed, funny off we go- unsuspecting - to the theaters and then become disappointed, angry and/or embarrassed. If the promos did show the raunch, would anyone go to the movies? Well, maybe 7th and 8th graders would as all this rocks their worldÂ…Â…Â…for a while anyway. There seems to be an audience for the above so a new rating system is needed for these 'raunchy comedies' as they seem to be here to stay. In the meantime I look at it this way: someone has to tell the unsuspecting that the promos are not telling the whole truth and they go at their own risk. But, many can Google the movie title and see what is really going on. Will they do it? Doubtful. I feel like I am taking a bullet for the many. AhhhhhÂ…Â…... the promos got me again. Who knew? See?

How good is that?How they made Chris Evans look like a 98-pound weakling is pure movie magic. I thought someone else played that part, someone who looked like Evans. Not so. It was him. There are a lot of good funny lines in here especially in the beginning. Before this movie I had no idea about Captain America. Don't recall any comic books but there must have been some. I was entertained, but yes, there was some hokey, sappy dialogue but you had to expect that. Hey, this was the 1940s and that is where all the hokey and sappy dialogue started. Still you believed because you are patriotic. Buy that? I did. The cinematography and stunts and CGI were simply terrific. The acting performances were also very good all around. (Bob, really.

","FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) convinces Irving (Christian Bale) and Sydney aka Edith - Prosser (Amy Adams) to run a con on Mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner) because he feels the Mayor is dirty. Later this scenario is expanded to include some members of Congress. And, still later the MOB gets involved. Oh oh!While watching for the first half hour when nothing really happens except to get us to know that Richie and Edith run cons and make a lot of money, I couldn't help being mesmerized by seeing if Edith's breasts (no bra) would pop out of the thin bands of cloth covering them. This went on for quite a while. They didn't, but I focused anyway. This was nominated for Best Picture. Did I agree? Not really because this should have been seamless and it wasn't. It was okay, but the real winners in here were Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence (Rosalyn, Richie's wife). Not to say that Christian Bale and Bradley Cooper weren't good, they were but nothing special (no Oscars for them, eh?). I don't think this movie would have been as good as it was if Adams and Lawrence were not in it. They were the breaths of fresh air for me. They made everything make sense when this meandered a bit in places. There seemed to be an obsession with hair. Richie had the worst comb-over of all comb-overs and why they went with this was a mystery. I felt like screaming at him, 'get a wig or go bald' as either one of those choices would have been better. I kept waiting for another character to brush his head in a friendly gesture. And, then there is Mayor Carmine's hairdo. It was an imitation of Steven Van Zandt's (Silvio in the Sopranos TV show) pompadour. When Jeremy Renner was on screen all I saw was his hair. As for Jeremy Renner himself I felt he felt somewhat out of place not being in a bomb suit or combat dress with an assault rifle in his hands. But, he did a good job as did everyone.Humor was attempted by Richie constantly asking his boss Stoddard Thorsen (Louis C.K.) for money, a plane and hotel space to further the sting on the Mayor and the Congressmen. Oh, yes, an Arab Shiek (Michael Pena) was also involved to look like the sting had impeccable backing. The confrontations between Richie and Thorsen were not funny to me, but this is the closest they came to humor. Pity.The reason I said this was not seamless was because too many of the stars in here had too much screen time and a lot of dialogues so it was hard to concentrate - as we normally would have - on the Star of the movie. They were all- of- them, the stars. See? Oh, Robert DeNiro had a cameo in here. (9/10)Violence: Yes, not much though. Sex: No. Nudity: No, but they came close.

The Bourne Ultimatum," Good, but the pace slowed
","Jason Bourne (Damon) is still trying to discover who he really is and the CIA still believes Bourne is a threat to them and they keep trying to kill him. Oh, oh.The editing on this movie is fantastic and reminded me of the editing job on Enemy of the State with Will Smith. Very good. The acting all around is Oscar worthy (What? Does it always have to be an English Classic?) The cinematography, dialogue and stunts were all terrific. Music could have made more of an impact, but it didn't.Yes, a very good thriller again, but the pace has slowed somewhat when compared to the previous two Jason Bourne movies. Maybe the story dictated this. They tried to pick the pace up again when Bourne is running across rooftops and thru people's apartments as he tries to intercept the hit-man going for Nicky (Stiles). However, that chase went on for too long a time. (Hey, I don't have all day. Have to watch Judge Judy, you know.) And, when Bourne does catch up with the hit-man (Yeah, what am I giving away? Like you didn't know he would catch him?) it takes Bourne about 10-mintes to put him away in a very good fight where I had to duck a couple times. But previously, Bourne put the bad guys away with some fantastic moves in a matter of seconds. Here, it took a long time (Remember, I have get back to Judge Judy).Julia Stiles is simply beautiful and has that Priscella Presley pouting look. Very sexy. I am in love again. You will hate David Strathairn in this movie and love him in We Are Marshall. Go figure. Guess that is the mark of a terrific actor and he is that.And, it cannot be said enough that Matt Damon is a quality actor and why isn't he nominated for something in these Bourne movies?

Rush," Great Racing Movie
","This based upon a true storyWe go back to the 1970s and see an intense rivalry between two Formula One (F1) racers: James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Hunt is an aggressive driver likes the spotlight, is a womanizer, and puts his life on the line in every race. Lauda is the more conservative driver, calculating, plays the percentages, shuns the spotlight. Rivalries. We like them and if two that we like are at the top of the profession we want them to be friends. Were Hunt and Lauda friends? Jack and Arnie are friends, Roy and Gene were friends, and Chrissy and Martina are friends. Connors and McEnroe respect each other but are not friendsÂ….. yet. In this movie we don't know who to root for. We tend to side with Hunt, until we see Lauda and Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara) picked up on the highway by extreme fans of Lauda. These scenes are pure gold. Now we like Hunt and Lauda equally. See?This movie centers on the 1976 race for the Formula 1 Championship. Hunt wins, Lauda wins and Lauda has the edge in points. In the final race,in Japan under severe rainy conditions, for the Championship Lauda retires (this word is used when a driver leaves the race for reasons under his control) from the race and it is up to Hunt to come in at least in 3rd place to claim the championship from Lauda who is ahead on points. Will he do it?The acting and dialogues are spot on and one would think that Hunt and Lauda disliked each other, but we see glimpses of friendship too. Their views on how to race are like night and day and neither one will change. The racing shots are fantastic with superb editing and heart-pounding music. This is a very exciting racing movie and you cannot take your eyes away. However, this is also a study in personalities and who will win out? Hunt? Lauda? Anyone? No one?I am not a fan of F1 racing, but I am a fan of movies that show F1 racing like this one. Kudos to Director, Ron Howard, who did a fantastic and amazing job. And, now the answer: yes, Hunt and Lauda were friends, not real close but each wanted something the other had. In their early racing years they roomed together for about a year (Hey, I looked it up on Wikipedia). After Hunt dies at age 45 of a heart attack, Lauda says at the end of the movie that Hunt was the only one he envied. Lauda currently works for Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team.Both James Hunt and Niki Lauda are in the F1 Hall of Fame (I looked that up too). (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes mostly in the beginning.

Oblivion," Terrific. Great Sci-Fi
","It's 2077. The war on earth is over. The Alien Scavengers (Scavs) lost, but some are still around. Earth is devastated and all the people were relocated to one of Saturn's moons. Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) has a job of repairing robot drones that will help reclaim earth's resources. He and his Communications Officer, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) are the only two on earth and their contracts are almost completed and she cannot wait to leave. Jack, on the other hand, wants to stay. When a space ship crashes near Jack, he is told not to investigate because of the intense radiation, but he goes anyway, discovers there is no radiation, sees his drones kill the people in stasis, but he saves Julia (Olga Kurylenkio) who he had been seeing in dreams (his memories had been wiped and these dreams of her confuse him) and now has doubts about all he had been told, and why did his drones kill?When he meets the leader of the Scavs, Beech (Morgan Freeman), he is told things are not what they seem and he tells Jack to go to the Radiation Zone and learn the truth. The Radiation Zone has always been off limits because Â…Â….well, because of the radiation. Get it? And, when he goes there you, too, will learn the truth especially if you listened carefully to Beech's explanation - when Jack was captured - of how things happened regarding the war. The visuals and CGI are Oscar-Worthy and some of the most impressive I have ever seen. Jack's bubble type run-about air ship is a thing of beauty. Hey, I want one. The acting by all is very good. There is not a lot of action during most of the movie, but I was riveted to my seat from the beginning. I like good Sci-Fi and this is one of the best. I didn't want it to end. The music - also Oscar-Worthy- is a winner in here. It'll get your heart pumping and your toes-tapping at times. Very good. Kudos. Yes, in the beginning, you may recall that silly WALL-E movie (don't hold back, let it out) but this one with humans, is much, much better. This is a terrific Sci-Fi movie. (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Burn After Reading," Complicated, but pretty good
","A couple of health gym trainers (Pitt, McDormand) obtain a CD that has CIA information on it and they try to sell it.The above is the simplest explanation and major plot of the story, but this story really gets complicated and you just have to keep up as things move pretty fast too. However, the producers realized that we may get a little lost and have a CIA agent (Rasche) report to his boss (Simmons) everything that we have seen so far. They did this for us twice. Wasn't that nice of them? Lost no more.For George Clooney to play a womanizer with that really bad looking beard didn't make sense. Here the beard was a distraction, not a turn on as I guess the director expected it to be. Reminded me of Blutto in a Popeye cartoon. I kept waiting for Frances McDormand to say, 'Ya, you betcha.' at times (go see Fargo).There are some clever lines and antics but I wouldn't go so far to say they were laugh out loud lines and antics. Well, 7th graders may LOL. All is good and enjoyable and there are some twists and turns. And, one really big shocker.Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes.

Man of Steel," Very Good Reboot
","The infant Kal-El is sent from the planet Krypton to Earth and ends up saving the planet as Superman (Henry Cavill) from General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his men. We are going back to the beginning of the Superman story and some of this incorporates changes from what we used to know. So be prepared. (Rebooting is now our way of life, don't you know?)Long story short: The first half is very good, the second half is all CGI with Superman fighting Zod and his men. These fight scenes are dragged out for way too long and no one cared about collateral damage as these supermen crashed into just about every building in Metropolis and we watch as they fall. And, yes, the CGI is super spectacular, but again, no one cared about collateral damage. Even in the Superman comic books Superman tried to do the fighting away from the population. Not here. There seems to be the Hollywood directors club that says we the people want to see devastation on a large scale and this is what we have. The use of flashbacks when Clark Kent was a youth was very good. They make their points with Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) providing parental guidance to a young Clark. These learning techniques may well prove to be beneficial in later sequels. They were like 'wax on, wax off' moments and filled in gaps nicely. What we didn't know: Clark as a young adult apparently left home to work on a fishing boat, a bar, and an I-Hop. These journeys were never explained. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) knows from the get â€“go who Clark is and there is no mystery regarding a secret identity. The 'S' on Superman's suit is not an 'S', it is Kryptonian for Hope. Make of that what you will. Oh, his suit is not a bright red, yellow and blue anymore, it's quite dark. Kal-El (later Clark) had a live birth the traditional way.Seems Kryptononians had egg farms (so to speak) and the eggs were genetically engineered to provide the newborn's skill and station in life. This is what General Zod was all about protecting. All in all, this was very good reboot and the supporting cast provided solid performances from Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White; Diane Lane as Ma Kent; Harry Lennix as General Swanwick; Richard Schiff as Dr. Hamilton; and Russell Crowe as Jor-El and we see him for most of the movie, and not just when Krypton was exploding. Ooops, there was no Jimmy Olsen (maybe in a sequel).Yes, I liked this story, reboot and all, but I thought Michael Shannon was not menacing enough as General Zod. It just didn't work for me. I waited until the movie ended to see if we would see Superman fly towards us with a big toothy grin as Christopher Reeves did. That toothy grin endeared him to us for all time (getting weepy now). Didn't happen with Henry Cavill and it should have.When all is said and done with Zod and his men and Clark goes to work for the Daily Planet we do see Clark with the mandatory glasses and guess what else: Buck Teeth. Hey, there's our big toothy grin as he smiles and sees Lois at her desk. HA! (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,4,8,20 November 2013
21," Did someone say, 'Deal?'
","MIT professor Micky Rosa (Spacey) recruits some of the brightest minds there to help him take Las Vegas down by having these students count cards at the Blackjack tables. Counting cards is not illegal, but if caught there are consequences. This movie is based loosely on events that happened in the 1990s when MIT students took Las Vegas for millions by counting cards. The story here is fiction and goes to show how things might have been done.We knew what they were trying to do without understanding the mechanics of counting cards. And, we are left with Ben (Sturgess) getting greedy by gambling and not counting as per the system. So it turns into a story about some MIT students, greed, betrayal, and retaliation. There's a twist in here. Was there that twist back in the day when this all happened.? Probably not. Actually, the twist helps save the movie. How about that deal?The acting was fine by all, but I do not know why they bothered to have a love interest story too as there was no chemistry between Ben and Jill (Bosworth). Oh, it wasn't much but it was there. Wait a minuteÂ…Â…good looking guy, Â…Â…good looking girlÂ…Â…Â…Oh, I get itÂ…Â…Â…..Got to have it now.How, in real life, in the 1990s, were these students caught? Casino people kept seeing the same faces at the same Casinos over a period of time and put 2+2 together. No, this movie did not 'catch' them that way. Usually, when a story is true we learn what happened to the participants at the end of the movie before the credits are run. There was nothing shown here along those lines. But then again, in real life, the students were rotated over the years so I guess that would be hard to do. In real life, there may not have been an MIT professor who managed and supervised the operation so it may have just been the students themselves. The students were told never to come back to Vegas or they would be prosecuted for trespassing. Did someone say 'DEAL?'If you take out the DVD, there is a Special Features section on it where the cast will explain Card-Counting. Good luck with that. Violence: Yes.

Trouble with the Curve," Pretty Good. No Trouble Here
","Successful lawyer Mickey (Amy Adams), the daughter of Gus (Clint Eastwood) desperately needs Gus' approval and love but they never come. Gus is a scout for a major league baseball team and his eyes are failing him. Mickey decides to help when Gus has to make a decision on a new hitting prospect. I believe that Clint Eastwood relishes the curmudgeon roles he takes lately. Honestly, we don't mind too much but it is getting somewhat old as he's the same character in different clothes. However, this is Mickey's story and she has to deal with Gus, who abandoned her years ago. Gus is one of those people who cannot express love and caring. Enter Johnny (Justin Timberlake) who keeps Gus and Mickey on a somewhat even keel, although that is not easy. And, if truth be told, Timberlake is becoming a fine actor in his own right. This is a pretty good baseball story and the title could have well have been Trouble with Change. We see behind the scenes discussions with the management and how they view things with the statistics that computers bring to the gameÂ….ahÂ…..business. Of course, Gus would have none of it. All this works because we fall in love with Mickey and hope the best for her, and it was over too soon for me. Hey, the heart wants what the heart wants.(7/10)Violence: Not really.

Knowing," Another PLUS for Sci Fi Movies
","An envelope from 50-yrs ago in a Time Capsule is opened by John's (Cage) son Caleb (Canterbury) and there is a page inside that list hundreds of numbers. What do they mean? Do the numbers mean something or nothing at all? What exactly is the End Game? Inquiring minds want to know.Do you believe everything is preordained or is everything just random coincidence? This movie attempts to explain this in a Sci Fi kind of way. Oh, yes, Aliens from 'out there' are involved. Wouldn't be a good Sci Fi flick if they were not included.From a list of seemingly random numbers on a page how does John figure out what the numbers mean? If he never figures them out we will see him staring at the page of numbers for an entire movie. What date stands out to us more than any other? 9/11/01. All John had to do was look for that thread and he knows. And, didn't I mention he is a Astro Physics professor from M.I.T.? Oh, sorry. All geniuses look for what they know and when they find it, they see if other things fit. Simple. Well, simple for them. The entire production is first class, and the acting is flawless. The stunts and CGI are nothing short of terrific. This was engaging, suspenseful and quite exciting. Those subway crash scenes had me ducking too. The only downside that I could see was there was not the communication between John and Caleb that there should have been especially since Caleb had been contacted by the aliens. That lack of communication didn't seem right since John knew Caleb was contacted. See?So what did you decide: Everything predetermined or just chance? Go see the movie and then decide. Or not. What is going to happen will happen with or without you, what you decide on or what you don't decide on. What will be will be. Is there a song in there somewhere?Violence: Yes.

Hugo," Pure Gold
","Now living in a Paris clock tower after his father (Jude Law) is killed in an explosion, 14-yr old Hugo (Asa Butterfield) takes care of the railroad station clock having been trained by his uncle (Ray Winstone).Occasionally, a movie comes along that is pure gold. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Hugo are prime examples. There appears to be two stories in here and each one compliments the other. First we are concerned with Hugo who is trying to find a message he feels his late father has left for him . Hugo believes that message is to be found within the Automaton (immobile robot) that he is attempting to rebuild and that was neglected and left to rust in some museum. But, later Hugo discovers that the message within the Automaton leads to a bigger message for the whole world when George Melies (Ben Kingsley) a pioneer film maker is rediscovered to complete an important part of art film history. It is well known that Director Martin Scorsese (Bob takes a drink) is passionate about preserving film for ages to come and this story brings that home. The credits say that Scorcese (another drink is taken) also had a small part in the movie as a photographer. But, I couldn't see Scorcese (another drink is downed) unless Scorcese (a drink is gulped) was in some disguise. Well, the flashbacks did go back before the 1920s and we are in the 1930s. I was looking for an older Scorcese (drink taken again) not a young Scorsese (another drink downed). And, now you know how to play the Scorcese (finishes off glass) drinking game. The game was first introduced by two actors hosting some awards show (Golden Globes?) earlier this year. The setting is Paris, France, and although all characters had French names, no one spoke with a French accent and, to be truthful, that was a good thing as everything was easier to understand. Reminded me of the movie Valkyrie when no one spoke with a German accent. The background music had French overtones that fit perfectly. There is also a very nice French song at the end when the credits run. You should listen.Standouts: Kingsley, of course; Butterfield as Hugo with those haunting eyes; Chloe Grace Moretz as the almost girlfriend to Hugo; Christopher Lee with that imposing authoritative voice as the kind giver of books; and Sacha Baron Cohen as the comic relief who surprisingly played his role perfectly as the Stationmaster. Cohen mildly approached an imitation of Dr. Stangelove and there were times I expected his Borat character to emerge as well, but that never happened. Yes, we are wary of Sacha Baron Cohen as we never know what he will do next. All in all, the actors above and the rest of the cast were exceptional. Kudos.The cinematography was simply outstanding. I liken it to Avatar when the eyes were given a visual treat. And, here the CGI was simple, complicated and more than just right. Hugo was nominated for: Best Picture, Costume Design, and Directing. Didn't win. But, it won the Oscar for Art Direction, Cinematography, Visual Effects, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing. As far as I am concerned it should have won for all the Oscars it was nominated for. Hey, we are talking pure gold here. An excellent family film touted as pure gold. BTW: That drink was iced tea although I am told others use something stronger. (10/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",10,4,8,16 March 2012
Wanted," OMG, one of the best ever
","Wesley Gibson's (McAvoy) life is going nowhere, and he knows it and can doing nothing about it. Then he is told his father was a top assassin and was recently killed. Wes is given the chance to avenge his father's death by joining a secret society of Assassins.I thought the last Die Hard movie (Live Free or Die Hard) was the best ever action movie. Mr. and Mrs Smith was very good too along with Hit-man (what, you didn't see that?). Then I saw Wanted. OMG, I saw stunts that I have never seen performed before, whether in real time or CGI didn't matter. I saw bullets turn corners (well, we do know that is fiction, but it works in this movie) and I saw a brutal training program (for Wes, of course) that had me on the floor crawling to the bathroom for rolls of gauze, Neosporin, and Vicodin. Wow! This movie is on a par with Live Free or Die Hard. Excellent. The acting by all is very good, but the stunts whether real or with CGI (hard to tell sometimes) keep this movie going at breakneck speed and you don't get lost, you are right there with it enjoying, and yes, cringing with every moment. But, then something began to happen. I didn't care about Wes or any of the characters. I just wanted (yes, a little play on words) the stunts to keep coming, the more the better. I did not care if Wes succeeded or if anyone succeeded as long as the stunts kept coming. Yes, I felt the characters were developed enough (I knew what they were about - you will know too Â– hey, they are assassins, what more do you need to know?), but I just didn't care about them. I wanted more stunts. They were so good I was hooked. They were far different and superior from anything I have ever seen and Wow!Yes, there is a story here and it's pretty good and there are some twists and turns as well.But it will be the stunts you will be talking about.

Warrior," Qyuite a Story
","Tommy Riordan (Hardy) trains to be a Kick Boxer and ends up fighting his estranged brother, Brendan, (Edgerton) in the big fight. Both brothers want nothing to do with their father (Nolte).This is really quite a story and I wondered if it was true. I looked but couldn't find that it was. But, in here you get to know all the characters pretty good as they were well defined. Well, except for Tommy as he has a secret and keeps to himself. The dialogues go a long way to making this real and enjoyable.The fight scenes are brutal, but just keep telling yourself, 'it's only a movie.' That didn't work for me as I was getting a real workout squirming this way and that and dodging this and that too. I knew the brothers would end up fighting each other in the final match, but I didn't know who would win. As the story goes, I tended to favor one brother over the other and then a strange thing happened. I started to favor the other brother. Who will you favor? I thought I was getting weary of all these fight movies, but they seem to get better and better. Who knew?This is Kick Boxing and it's almost a no holds barred fight. There are rules but when you watch you ask yourself: what are the rules as you don't see any adherence to them whatever they are. Senator John McCain wants the sport abolished as he calls it Human Cock Fighting. I am sure we will see more of Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as both did outstanding jobs.

This movie is basically a chase throughout, but what a chase. The choreography of the stunts is fantastic and I don't believe any CGI was used. Hard to tell. This is pure entertainment. What more could an audience want? Realism? Go somewhere else. This is pure escapism and that is what most movies are all about. Great job. In many ways Angelina reminds us of Laura Croft, and, of course, Mrs Smith, however, the circumstances now are different, as she is determined to get away and clear her nameÂ…Â…at least that is what we are led to believe. So we hunker down with her and hope for the best even though she does things that have us questioning her real purpose and we ask: is she who we thought she was?This a solid suspenseful thriller, and yes, there are a few twists you won't see coming.

We're the Millers," Sometimes funny, still raunchy and has uncomfortable moments
","David (Jason Sudeikis) sells Weed on a small scale. His boss Brad (Ed Helms) needs him to go to Mexico and bring back a 'smidgen' of pot. David agrees but decides to take a fake family with him so the Mexican Border Officials only see a family on vacation in an RV. Fake family consists of wife: Rose (Jennifer Aniston) who is a stripper; son: Kenny (Will Poulter), and daughter: Casey (Emma Roberts).If it weren't for the some uncomfortable moments, and raunchy sex talk this would have been pretty good. But, Hollywood insists on Raunch thinking that is what most people want to see in a 'comedy.' Maybe they are right as most comedies these days contain volumes of Raunch and all become millionaires. I do have to admit there were some honest comedic moments when Raunch wasn't involved and I chuckled at times. And, I have new respect for Jason Sudeikis as he can carry a movie. I can see where he could become a pretty good dramatic or RomCom actor if given an opportunity. He is not a comedian by any stretch. He along with Jennifer Aniston did pretty good despite her mouthing F-words mostly in the beginning. But, you must know about some uncomfortable moments. A Mexican policeman wants $1000.00 or oral sex to let the 'family' pass. Not having the USD, David selects Kenny to do the deed until David realizes the policeman meant he wants 1,000 Pesos, not USD and David gives the policeman the equivalent of 1,000 Pesos (about $80) and the policeman goes on his way. On the way back to the US, the 'family' meets up with the Fitzgeralds who have some troubles in their sex life. There is an encounter whereby we thought we were going to see wife-swapping or something close to that. Turns out Mrs Fitzgerald (Kathryn Hahn) just feels Rose's breasts through her blouse and that ended as a first step to solving the Fitzgeralds' problem. Still this was quite uncomfortable as we didn't know how long this would go on. The other uncomfortable moment comes when Kenny gets bitten on his genitals by a spider. And, I really didn't think they would show his genitals, but they did. This was to show Rose how bad it was and she needs to decide if he should go to a hospital. And, it is bad and they do take Kenny to a hospital.Those moments above were the most uncomfortable and if it weren't for them and the language, this could have been a fun movie. There is a twist no one saw coming mostly because I believe the 4-writers of this mess couldn't come up with any more uncomfortable moments. Hence we get to see some real action stunts with vehicles. I know I let the cat out of the bag with the uncomfortable moments above, but you had to know about them especially if you decide to watch with children. (3/10)Violence: Yes.

Silver Linings Playbook," The Dialogues and Lawrence's Eyes Win This One
","Pat (Bradley Cooper) is released from a psychiatric hospital and moves back into his parents' house. He has been diagnosed as bipolar and has a restraining order against him by his ex-wife, Nikki (Brae Bee) He wants to get his life back and constantly looks for silver linings to let him know he is on track. He meets a somewhat damaged Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) but is still obsessed with Nikki and wants her back. So what we have here is troubled boy (Pat) meets troubled girl (Tiffany) and can these two negatives make a positive? What makes this work is the dialogue between the two because when one has nothing to lose one becomes brutally honest. And, that is what we have here and it was most refreshing even with numerous F-bombs flying everywhere. Bradley Cooper must have bought a Flobee (google it) as his beard is always the same length throughout, but the beard was necessary to give his face some much needed definition. Good move. He does a good job and he needs to stay with drama and leave those unfunny and raunchy HANGOVER movies behind. They made Jennifer Lawrence look a little Goth, but once you look into those eyes you instantly fall in love. When she delivers her lines it's like she is talking directly to you. The chemistry between these two works only because of her eyes. When she is on screen, you don't see anyone else. (Hey, we fell in love with her when we saw Winter's Bone. Nothing has changed.)A very good supporting cast is bolstered by Jackie Weaver (Pat's mother) and Robert DiNero (Pat Sr) who does probably his best work in years. Pat Sr is an avid Eagles fan but has lost his job and now makes book and this plays into the movie's outcome.Danny (Chris Tucker) who was also in that psychiatric hospital with Pat keeps getting released, or so he says, but the cops always find and return him. He was okay even though he was given subdued lines. What happened to the Chris Tucker we liked from those Rush Hour movies? Subdued lines and Chris Tucker don't mesh. Hey, we had Pat rant and rave when he was off his meds and everyone was afraid of him, why not Chris Tucker when he's the best at that and he does it with humor? They could have found a way. Bummer.There is a twist in here (it's a good one) and you could see it coming from miles away and this is where the love story really takes hold. The highlight of the movie is the dance contest that Tiffany talks Pat into practicing for and actually performing in. As we (and they) go along we just cannot understand why Pat cannot see that silver lining - he keeps looking for - that is before him all the time. All in all this is excellent, but the dialogues all around and Lawrence's eyes make it so.Silver Lining Playbook was nominated for Best Picture. Bradley Cooper was nominated for Best Actor. Jackie Weaver was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Robert DeNiro was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. David O. Russel was nominated for Best Director and Adapted Screenplay. Jennifer Lawrence was the only one to come away with an Oscar: Best Actress. Well deserved. (9/10)Violence: Yes, some at the football game; and Pat goes berserk a lot in the beginning.

Divergent," Pretty Good Sci-Fi Story
","The war is over and now when one becomes 16-yrs of age, one must make a decision as to which group to belong to: Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (honest), Dauntless (brave) and Erudite (intelligent). These Factions, as they are called, are designed to maintain peace so war won't happen again. Tris (Shailene Woodley) leans toward Dauntless, but she really doesn't fit in there. She is Divergent (free thinker, non conformist) and Divergents are considered dangerous and may be put to death. This can't be good. I believe we have found another Katniss as Tris (Shailene) reminds us of another HUNGER GAMES kind of thing. I will admit that in the beginning when they showed Tris, I saw Katniss. See? There are some differences: no bows and arrows, no killing of children. The children in here undergo intense initiation training that can kill them if they are not careful enough. But, make no mistake about it, this is still a dictatorship under the guise of peaceful Factions. Their mantra is Faction before Blood. The real culprit that this dictatorship wants to control and eliminate is: The Human Condition. Can you believe that? Who makes this stuff up? (dictators is the answer) As we looked to Katniss to affect change, we now look to Tris to do the same. But, this won't be easy. She doesn't have a bow and arrows. Oh, ohÂ…Â…Â…Â… How can she do this?Most of the movie shows the training of Dauntless hopefuls and some of it is hard to watch. This training focuses on individual fears and how the candidates perform when confronted with his/her greatest fear. In time we get to see a love story, sort of, and hope for the best, of course. We watch Tris try to qualify and not be dropped out of the program. But, to be fair, it's the love story angle that keeps us in our seats. We know it's there, however, that aspect takes a long time to crystallize, but we are a patient audience and believe we will be rewarded in time. The fight scenes and acting all around are very good. Besides Shailene as Tris another standout is Theo James as Four who comes across as a very strong character. There was a little joke in the beginning when Four announces his name and one of the candidates says to him, 'Four? Were 1, 2 and 3 already taken?' We are told that the candidates are only to speak when spoken to. So right here we know the candidates will be in for a rough time of it. The rest of the cast performed well and Ashley Judd as Tris' mother, Natalie, does a credible job. Seems most of the candidates have to have tattoos and we can only hope they are washable.Over all a pretty good Sci-Fi story. The ending leads us to believe there will be a sequel or sequels. Can't wait, can you? (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Soft stuff and not much of it.",7,0,1,6 August 2014
Ender's Game," And, a child shall lead them
","The Earth was almost devastated 50-years ago by the Formics, a superior race bent on destroying all on Earth. Only by a heroic action by Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) was the earth saved and the Formics retreated. Earth has now regrouped and 11-year old Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) trains to lead a team of Children Warriors to once and for all defeat the Formics so they would never again be a threat to Earth. Why the decision to go with youth? As Col Graf (Harrison Ford) explains, 'we need a new kind of soldier. One who doesn't think the way we think.' HmmmÂ…Â….seems to make sense. We find out why Ender was picked in the first place by Col Graf. We follow the training of all the young warriors, monitored, of course, by Col Graf. Cameras are everywhere. We see some hazing by upper-classmen, and friendships made.The acting all around is good and we are riveted. In his free time Ender plays a game on his tablet but doesn't understand why a certain a bird-like creature appears in the game and lures him to a collapsed building. That was not part of the game. He stops the game. The title of this movie being what it is, I thought that Ender Wiggin had a game plan and just needed to complete training to implement that plan when the war was really on. That is what I thought when I watched. But, sadly that is not the case and you will see how wrong I was. But, what happens is very clever. No doubt about it. Yeah, there is a twist hereÂ…Â… kind ofÂ…Â… somewhatÂ….. almostÂ….. and it may shock you. The CGI visuals, cinematography were simply outstanding. This may be one of the first futuristic Sci-Fi stories/movies that acknowledge computer tablets and email. Star Trek never did that. At the end of the movie we see Ender realize something and now knows why that bird-like creature appeared in his game on the tablet. (7/10) Violence: Yes.

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Tedious, Tiresome
","Having survived a Witch's prison when they were children, Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) become Witch Hunters as adults. In turn, they hire themselves out to towns where children have been abducted by Witches, who need the children to perform a blood-moon ceremony that will ultimately keep Witches safe from fire. There is something wrong with Hollywood when it thinks it knows that we all out here want to see Horror movies with Zombies, Vampires, and now Witches who want to do one thing: kill, kill , kill with blood spurting every which way, heads exploding and being lopped off. Yes, the CGI and special stunts are very good. It's the killings that are becoming tedious, tiresome and, yes: unhealthy. There are just too many of these types of stories and there doesn't seem to be any slowing down of them. They just go on and on and onÂ…Â…Â…..When the killing action sequences go on forever, I tend to go to La La Land, sleep for a half hour, wake up and see that the killing action is still going on; and the process repeats when the next killing sequence comes around and they come around rather quickly. So if all you want to see are these killing action scenes, then this is for you. As for me, I am out.So what's next? The Three Little Pigs as Hit men? (3/10)Violence: Yes.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," On Par with the Swedish Version
","Part owner of Millennium magazine, Mikael Blomquist (Daniel Craig) is convicted of libel, but has some time before sentencing and is hired by Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to find out what happened to Harriet, his niece, who disappeared 40-years ago and is believed deceased. Mikael hires Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) to help with his investigation. I believe most movie goers have seen the Swedish version of this movie and are busy comparing notes of what was similar, different and so on. So let's get to it.For my part, I have also seen the Swedish version and it was excellent having watched via sub titles, but I must go on record as saying the US version is just as good but perhaps, more clear regarding the story line. The Swedish version had too many sub plots that had one memorizing them to see what impact they would have on the main story. None is the answer. Differences......there are some. The setting is Sweden, but the currency is not touted in Swedish Kronas, but USD; no accents were heard and they were clever enough not to show us traffic direction signs that were in Swedish. In the Swedish version I do not recall Henrik Vanger purchasing controlling interest in Millennium magazine. Where Harriet is discovered is completely different in this version. Does it matter? No. There were no lingering shots of the landscapes as were in the Swedish version. Pity, I missed them. One big difference is that in this version Mikael tracks down Lisbeth to help in his investigation whereas in the Swedish version it is Lisbeth who hacks into Mikael's computer to give him clues re the disappearance of Harriet as she knows what he was hired for by Henrik. Then Mikael feels she can help him. Does this make any difference to the story? No.Now for the question I just know you have: Who was the better Mikael? Michael Nyqvist or Daniel Craig? They were both excellent and no one outdid the other. But, let's get to the real question: Who was the better Lisbeth Salander? Noomi Rapace or Rooney Mara? Both were excellent, and could have been interchangeable, butÂ…Â…..this story made the Rooney Lisbeth softer, more giving. But, we cared more for the Noomi Lisbeth because we wanted her to be softer, more giving and she wasn't. But we still cared more for her. See? Also, the Swedish version had more story face time with Noomi than with Rooney. Both versions had the sex scenes between Mikael and Lisbeth but the US version showed them 2-times whereas the Swedish version only once. In this version, Lisbeth orally servicing her Guardian was shown more graphically and the rape scene seemed to go on longer here than in the Swedish version. More total frontal nudity was shown in this version. Both versions are very good and quite engaging and the differences do not hinder the story, but in the US version things become clearer without the non-important sub plots that were in the Swedish version. If you didn't see the Swedish version, this version will do. But, if you want to compare notesÂ…Â…Â…..Now for the question that still remains: Is there another country that will do a remake of this story? England? India? (hey, India makes more movies than the US. Why should they be left out? Huh?) And, yes there are two more stories to this trilogy. Any takers on the horizon? (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, 2-times.

The Men Who Stare at Goats," Not Funny. Boring
","So I take out this movie about men who look like goats. (Bob, that's men who stare at goats. You are not reading the DVD box again) Stare at goats? Why would anyone do that? Anyway, I watch it and decide, well, I'll tell you what I decided at the end of this. Bill Django (Bridges) is the father, so to speak, of the Earth Army that train by Remote Viewing and other psychic techniques. Lyn (Clooney) was a gifted student and had exceptional psychic abilities and now he wants to hook up with Django in Iraq. Bob Wilson (McGregor), a reporter, goes with him. This is billed as a comedy, but there was nothing funny in here, no good lines, no physical sight gags. This was a movie for the Clooney-McGregor-Bridges-Spacey in-crowd. I can see no other purpose. It has absolutely nothing to offer except for those of you who want to Google Remote Viewing. That is real.There are a ton of flashbacks that go on for soooooo long that you forget what brought the memory up in the first place. And, for a movie with nothing to say, offer, or tell your friends about (don't do that) this was toooooo long also. I would say the acting all around was good. The script was terrible. What can one do?Oh, wait a minute. There was something that happened that was kind of funny. Lyn is driving in the desert and hits a rock in the middle of the road. It happened so fast, the airbags deployed (well only the driver side air bag), and that got a chuckle out of me. That was it. And, now for what I decided: I would rather have watched a movie about men who look like goats. Violence: Yes Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, brief. Language: Yes, some.",3,2,9,25 March 2010
Bad Teacher," No reason to watch
","Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) is a bad teacher. She has only two things she is interested in: finding a rich husband and enhancing her breast size. The first third of this movie broadcasts: nudity, foul-mouthed raunchy language, drug use, and in general a deep uncaring for everything appropriate to include her students and their concerns. The next two thirds come in calmer but the language and the uncaring are still with us. There is nothing funny in here. Everything is a scheme to get Ms Halsey what she wants and her ways know no bounds. She is up for everything to get a rich husband and the money to pay for the breast implants. She cons everyone but Amy (Punch) her chief rival, but Amy is no match for this teacher.There is no reason to see this movie. It doesn't serve anyone for anything. This is just another example of Hollywood not knowing what to do anymore. This movie is on the same level as HESHER, and BAD SANTA but not as mean-spirited, but close. Are we starting to see a trend? Perhaps, but let's hope not. The only people you cared for were the ones at the butt of Ms Halsey's foul mouthed barbs. The acting performances were fine -- it is the script that needed work. This could have been funny, but it just comes across as unfunny bathroom humor. There is no salvation to be found in here. At the end of the movie, Ms Halsey behaves the same as she did in the beginning. At least that is the implication I got out of it. Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Drug use: Yes.

The Amazing Spider-Man," Best One Yet
","Spiderman (Andrew Garfield) gets involved with a version of Animal Control gone bad.This is a reboot from Hollywood. You are welcome America. The reason this is a reboot is because Hollywood knows we cannot remember the previous Spiderman movies and who cares anyway? That said, this is, by far, the best one yet. Why? Inquiring minds want to know.This is the best one yet because it was more on a realistic vein. The previous ones were too campy, had too much humor (oh, the horror) and too many scenes were in daylight. The previous ones were good let's be clear about that. Well, except for Spiderman 3 when Peter Parker wore the black suit. Not good at all. Here the story was more realistic not that we needed it to be, but our main focus is that we are entertained. And, entertained we were. Also, in here we see a good guy Dr. Connors (Rhys Ifans) who changes into a bad guy (okay a lizard, a gigantic one) but with altruistic leanings for the betterment of mankind. How is that possible, you ask? Well, it really isn't, but work with me. As for Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as Spiderman we see him as dorky at first, then later we forget all about that and are convinced he can do Spiderman. And, we are good with it. End of story. One of the reasons this works is because we see pain inflicted on Peter and in or out of costume, talking with Gwen or his aunt, we see the tortured face and feel that pain. See?Supporting cast with Emma Stone as Gwen, the love interest; Denis Leary as the police chief, Martin Sheen as Peter's uncle and Sally Field as Peter's aunt were all very good. There were not enough scenes to really tell if the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen was good enough. Hey, this is a reboot and the feeling each other out took too long. Let's say the chemistry was almost there. Happy now? We'll see more chemistry in the sequels. Count on it. And, the main plot of the story is animal control gone bad and was easy enough for us to understand. Hey, we go to Spiderman movies to see the CGI and it was nothing short of fantastic. Remember when we saw Superman, the movie (that would be the first one) and we were told we would really believe a man can fly? Well, in here we needed to see Spiderman swinging all over the place and swing all over the place he did. What more can anyone ask? (well, maybe the 3-D Version). All in all very entertaining and Inquiring Minds are now satisfied, resting and waiting for the next one. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",10,4,9,17 November 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," Excellent AIDS Awareness Movie
","In 1985, the is somewhat a true story. The characters Eve (Jennifer Garner) and Rayon (Jared Leto) are fictional characters created to enhance the story. There are many inaccuracies in here regarding Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) and if you want to know the real scoop you need to do a keyword search on Ron Woodroof or do Wikipedia. This was done for the purpose to make people aware of AIDS and for entertainment. However, AIDS is still a serious problem.I don't think I have ever watched a movie whereby the main character is so fully invested into the character he is playing as McConaughey is playing Ron Woodroof. He deserved every bit of the Best Actor Oscar. But, truth be told, he should have won that award long ago for other movies he was in. But, that's just me. We are introduced to Ron as a gambler, sex addict, boozer andÂ…Â…well you name it. The opening scene has him performing a sex act at a rodeo with a scene of bull-riding in the background. Later in almost the very next scenes, we see an orgy and with threesomes thrown in. You see some nudity but everything else is up to your imagination. Then, Ron Woodroof contracts AIDS. He goes from denial, anger, thoughts of suicide to finding a drug that will cure him. He goes to Mexico where he learns that the experimental drug AZT causes severe side-effects including death and he is shown alternative medications. And, they work. It is here he decides to stock up on these meds and 'sell' them to other AIDS people across the border. He establishes the Dallas Buyers Club.Ron's confrontations with FDA and Border Control Officials are somewhat suspect as presented in this movie, and just when we think he will be arrested, the next scenes show him back in Dallas taking care of his new business. So there is a lot we are not told regarding these border crossings and FDA battles. Transvestite Rayon (Jay Letto) becomes Ron's friend and helps with the business. Letto received the Best Supporting Actor Award.So you know what is going on, but it is in the telling that brings all this to light. The telling is informative and spectacular as you are riveted not knowing what is coming next. Great acting by all, especially by McConnaughey whose dialogues are spot on.This is real stuff, There is real pain in being hurt, shunned, and living a life quite alone. I don't like to see people in pain regardless of the cause and even though this is 'just a movie' everything you see has happened to people with AIDS. 'There is nothing new under the sun' Pain is pain. See?At the end of the movie there is a statement that AZT strength was reduced and turned out to actually save millions afflicted with AIDS.

Now You See Me," Entertaining, but the Ending is Contrived
","Four very good Illusionists known as the Four Horsemen rob a bank in France while they are still in the United States, leave no clues and it is up to FBI Agents and Illusionist Exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), to figure out how it was done. The first 90% of the movie is captivating, riveting, engaging - yes, magical - and really quite good. I thought I might have to see it a second time to understand everything. But, there are subtle hints of something that went wrong years ago that became the actual focus of all that we see. In other words the twist at the end within the last 10%, was, IMHO, contrived and this is where the movie falls apart. I found it hard to swallow and when you get to know the characters, you may feel the same way too. To say more would be to give things away. There are questions I would like to ask of the character Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) but to do that here would give away too much. Sorry. Okay, here's the thing: I looked at him as the key to why everything worked the way it did, and my question to him would be: how did you become the Four Horsemen's benefactor? We were under the impression he was their banker. At the end of the movie you will surly have that question too because there is no way he can give a good answer: that was contrived too. CGI played a huge factor and it was spectacular in places, but the car chase on the bridge actually made me dizzy. It was one of those things where they sped up the film to make it like the cars were going 90-mph when they were actually going about 5-mph, if that. See? A little gimmicky. The crash was CGI. The heists or robberies that you will see are probably the most involved ever put on film. Kudos. One interesting scene I saw was on a bridge in Paris, France. The screen alongside the bridge had key-locks all along it. I believe, if you have secrets, you are supposed to attach the lock to the wire fence and throw the key into the river below. Thus your secrets are forever safe. Or, for the amorous: they can lock their love forever. Cool. To see what is up with that bridge, Google: Bridge in France that has key locks attached to wire fencing.All the actors performed well, and it will be up to you whether or not to believe them. Hey, these are professional actors and it's what they do: convincing you of what they say is true. Good luck. Overall, this was still very entertaining, but contrived when you see the ending and because of that we shall never see sequels regarding the Four Illusionist Horsemen. At least I don't think so (never say never, Bob). (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",7,0,1,4 September 2013
No Strings Attached," Pointless
","Adam (Kutcher) and Emma (Portman) have known each other since childhood, but not to damage their friendship, Emma offers a no strings attached relationship which means they can boink anyone they want and each other too and falling in love is out of the question. This is a Friends with Benefits movie. The first half is raunchy, unfunny sex talk and full of boinking here, there, and everywhere. Got old real fast. Not funny, clever, entertaining, or erotic. Oh, you don't see anything - just them running here and there like they were in some sort of sex marathon. Again, not funny. And, why are we watching?However, in the 2nd half Emma and Adam took a break and thus a somewhat normal movie broke out. Problem was that one of them was falling in love with the other so a stop had to be called. Two classy actors and this is all they can come up with? The title should have been Friends With Benefits for a clearer notion of what was inside. When one doesn't care about the characters, what is the point?Violence: No. Sex: Yes.

The Duchess," Of little historical importance
","The Duchess Georgiana (Knightley) cannot produce male heirs for the Duke (Fiennes), and takes lover Charles Grey (Cooper). The Duke has his mistress Bess (Atwell), but he still is not happy. Oh, these poor rich people. One of the reasons I like these English Royalty stories is you get to see the castles and palaces and their gardens, the architecture, the landscapes, and the moats. As for the story, we all know what they are all about. The Duke wants heirs, the woman he marries can't produce, wife falls in love with a non-Royal, the Duke has his mistress and they all live together, sort of. (That's one version and another would be almost the same except they pride themselves on killing off each other to work their way up the Royalty chain. That is not the case here. The first scenario sticks.)Now, where do you suppose we got all that information? How do we know what really happened back then? Remember all those servants standing around almost everywhere? Well, they got together and wrote tell-all books. All kept very hush-hush. Until now. And, I love this part: This is based upon a true story. See? How do we know? Indeed. The overall production is good, but very slow and very little T&A (the royalty stories are sometimes good for that too. But not this one). The acting is good, but no surprises and as such the whole thing could have been cut down quite a bit. Too much emphasis on what the women wore, the parties, the wigs and, of course, proper manners. The music was too subdued for this kind of a production. It should have been more prominent. Sometimes I wonder why these movies are made in the first place. Here practically nothing happens from a historical aspect. (But, remember that Charles Grey did become Prime Minister later on). Yes, then the story should have been about him. But, all that aside, seeing the palaces, the gardens, the architecture, the landscapes and the moats were all worth the price of admission. Didn't I mention that was the reason I liked these English Royalty stories?Violence: No. Sex: Yes. Nudity: No. Language: No.",5,1,2,29 May 2009
Quantum of Solace," Good, but some things are missing
","James Bond (Craig) is on the trail of Mr. Greene (Amalric) who may have led Vesper (who Bond fell for in Casino Royale) to betray Bond. Bond is after the truth and makes things personal.Hey, we have a new action hero. Bond, James Bond. Now, he is more like Bruce Willis, and Matt Damon who plays the Jason Bourne character. The action scenes rival anything we have ever seen. They are really good. To play this Bond, Daniel Craig needs to be in top shape. Can he keep it up? Do we want him to?No, we want the old Bond, James Bond, back, with less action, more calculating and, suave. Suave? Yes, suave. Gone are the facial expressions and quirky one-liners we have all come to know as the Bond, James Bond signatures. Where is Sean when we need him? We need change we can believe in. This Bond is not the Bond, James Bond we knew and loved. Oh, he's still good, just not the Bond, James Bond we crave.Gone also is the humor the one-liners gave us. The Bond, James Bond twinkle of the eyes. Gone. Moneypenney? Where was she? Gone. The Gadget Guy? Gone. And, the Bond, James Bond music that we are all familiar with came when the credits at the end rolled on by. At the end, for God's sake! At the end!!! And, one more thing. Unless I missed it I never heard Craig say the line we always expect in a Bond, James Bond movie, 'Bond, James Bond' when giving his name to someone.Okay, one more thing. Also no Baccarat or even Poker like in Casino Royale. Gone. Yes, Toto, this doesn't feel like Kansas anymore. These are not changes we like.

No Country for Old Men," Good Movie, but Overrated
","While hunting in the desert Lleweln Moss (Brolin) comes across dead bodies in an apparent drug deal gone bad. The money is still there and he takes it and now has to run for his life because the big drug boys want their money back.This is a good movie, but not Oscar Worthy (it won Best Picture). What were they (Academy) thinking? Someone needs to take the politics out of the voting. Javier Bardem won for Best Supporting Actor. Okay, that's a coin toss at best. Anyone could have won, 'but let's pick someone no one has ever heard of.' Ooops, not exactly a coin toss, was it? This is a good movie, but I wouldn't award it Best Screen Play (it won for that too). HmmmÂ….. how does that happen when there is more shooting going around than dialogue? The quality of the dialogue, ya think? HmmmmÂ…Â…Â…Â….no.This is a good movie and the story is told from the Sheriff's (Jones) perspective, hence the title. The problem I had was the movie time was mostly watching the running and killing. That took up most of the 2-hours. The Sheriff was an afterthought and came on the scene intermittently in a tired way. Maybe that was what he meant by being 'overmatched' (his words) when it came to keeping up with the bad guys. But, since most of the movie was watching the running, hiding, shooting and killing I thought the title should have been reflected there for the most part.This is a good movie, and, the title would have made more sense if the Sheriff's perspective was told after the fact, but here the story was told in the present. And, after the opening narrative by the Sheriff, the narration left us. See? And, the Sheriff's catharsis - in the present - at the end closes the loop? HmmmmÂ…Â…Â…Â…no.This is a good movie and the performances of all were excellent. I would say there was parity among Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and yes, Woody Harrelson even though his part didn't last all that long.This is a good movie and the pace was more than fine because I was kept on edge the whole time, and the scenes shifted often enough that nothing dragged.This is a good movie, but in my opinion, not Oscar Worthy for Best Picture.Violence: Yes; Sex: No; Nudity: No; Language: No",8,0,6,12 March 2008
District 9," Quite a story. Excellent
","Decades ago aliens came to Earth. The mother ship hovered over Johannesburg, South Africa, and an attack never came. The aliens became refugees and were sent to District 9. The aliens were docile but their living areas had become slums and they were becoming more aggressive, and the government needed to relocate them far away from the cities. By accident, Wikus (Copley) gets infected with alien DNA and the story starts.When the government tries to relocate the aliens and needs them to sign eviction papers it's a sight to see. I can only liken it to trying to get hundreds of monkeys to understand English and what is happening and putting eviction papers in their faces for them to sign. Get the picture? Not a pretty sight. The aliens are called Prawns because they look like shrimp with legs and they speak what sounds like insect utterances. Not sure how I know that. Both humans and aliens understand each other. The story didn't go into explaining how that came about unless I missed it. Actually, I really don't want to know.This is quite a story and I didn't think there would be one considering how the movie opened with the eviction notices, and all the confusion. The CGI is some of the best I have ever seen. The Alien leader of the mother ship never allowed himself to be identified. That would have been too easy and we wouldn't have a story. Why he never did that is not explained either. But, the story focuses on Wikus and his troubles and the story is quite good.

I am such a fan of ABBA that even though the cast performed the music I heard only the real ABBA sing. Oh, the cast was okay and if you never heard ABBA music, you could immediately fall in love with it. But, once you hear the real ABBA perform the music, everything else pales no matter how old you grow. Yes, there must have been times when lip syncing was done due to the seaside nature of some shots, but still it was okay. I only heard ABBA perform. The story was okay but if it weren't for the ABBA music it would have been an 'Oh Hum' made for TV movie. And, hard to believe that Pierce Brosnan can carry a tune. He did good.The director let the cast get away with overacting. Yes, a lot of the acting was over-the-top, but maybe they had so much fun with everything that the director let it go. ABBA music can have that effect so they are forgiven. ABBA music can make you go a little crazy. It is that good. For me, you can have your Beatles, Rolling Stones and any other group that you think is the best you have ever heard. Go listen to ABBA and get back to me. There was no group better. Well, Fleetwood Mac and the Bee Gees were pretty good too. Yes, I know there is no accounting for tasteÂ…Â…Â…Â…(or the lack of it) Got it out of your system? (I think so)And, you know, I think this would have been a lot better if the music from the real ABBA was in here. The lip syncing would not have been noticed (too much). And, I would have been okay with that. FYI: I did hear a rumor that ABBA was offered $1-Billion to perform again. They turned it down because they knew they could never, now, sound as good as they did back in the day. Talk about classÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â….I only heard ABBA perform.

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Great Story
","Jesse James (Pitt) is wary of his new gang since the old gang was either dead or in prison, and he knows something is up. After all there is a large reward on him, dead or alive, and he is retired nowÂ…..more or less. I thought the title was too long, and then I saw the movie and the title is exactly right. This is perhaps the most comprehensive story about Jesse James, and Robert Ford. All we ever heard in the past was that James went to fix a picture on the wall and Ford shot him in the back. That's all we ever heard until now.The story is slow, there is narration, and some scenes linger but all are necessary and artfully done. It's like watching a Ken Burns documentary come to life (Burns did excellent documentaries for TV on the Civil War, American Baseball, Jazz, WWII and many more using narration and still pictures that were available for the times) or reading the novel without actually reading the novel, but getting the full flavor of the novel. Say what? Now all of this couldn't have been experienced if it wasn't for the novel by Ron Hansen.There is no language in the movie but the new gang members, in the beginning as they sat around a camp fire, do use code words to describe a woman's parts. It wasn't necessary, not funny and they were probably incorporated to give us a sense of outlaw camp-fire talk, I suppose. Also, when the gang robbed the train (their last), most actors had troubles with keeping their bandanas on over their noses. Kind of funny now that I think about it. Casey Affleck did a great job (an Oscar performance? Maybe) as Robert Ford, but let's face it, he looks so much like brother Ben, that sometimes you see Ben when watching Casey. They look so much alike and have similar facial contortions. Maybe a mustache would help. Mary-Louise Parker was wasted here but maybe she just wanted to be in the movie at any cost. James Carville (political analyst) was good as the governor. Sam Shepard, as Frank James, was in and out so fast you hardly knew he was in here. The performances of the rest of the cast were excellent. As for Brad Pitt, he was Jesse James in every sense of the word that we have come to fantasize about. Can't get better than that. Yes, a great story. Violence:Yes; Sex:NO; Nudity:No; Language:No",9,0,1,12 February 2008
Twilight," Exceptionally well done
","Bella (Stewart) goes and lives with her father in the state of Washington and meets Edward Cullen (Pattinson) in a high school biology class. Guess which one is the Vampire.Where does one go to find a good Vampire movie these days? The Lost Boys must have found themselves, Buffy stopped fighting them, Ann Rice doesn't write about them anymore, and the Moonlight TV show was cancelled (Boo Hoo, btw).Get ready for a love story that is exceptionally well done. The chemistry is what this movie is all about and like Progresso Soup: it's in there. The entire cast was very good too, but without the chemistry between Pattinson and Stewart that dog won't hunt. Yeah, we all know it's wrong and there's no such thing as Vampires (Say what?), but someone has finally put a credible love story out there. If you can just get over one of them being a Vampire (doesn't exist, remember?) you will enjoy the dialogue, banter and some unusual CGI. No, no gore. Didn't I say this was well done? Okay, there is some blood, but hey, it's a vampire movie (yes, they don't exist, we know).Robert Pattinson has Christopher Walken hair (though darker), and he could almost play Elvis. What a combo. Both Pattinson and Miss Stewart did exceptional jobs. I do have a question though: does Stewart's name of Bella, in the movie, have anything to do with reminding us of Bella Lugosi? Hey, I won't stick my neck out too far on that one.Anyway, there is nothing uncomfortable in this movie and guess what? They are currently filming Twilight II ( 2009) because you like Vampire stories so much. Just can't get enough, can you? I know. Me too. They don't . . . . . what?Violence' Yes.

To Rome With Love," Disappointing
","Woody Allen gives us 4-stories and performs in one of them. 1. A very good opera singer is discovered. 2. John (Alec Baldwin) appears and disappears almost at will and, at times, proclaims what will and won't happen if certain actions are/are not taken. 3. A newlywed passes a prostitute off as his wife. 4. Roberto Benigni plays Leopoldo who is a favorite target of paparazziNone of the stories are related as in a CRASH scenario. Sorry. The movie moves along nicely, but only because the scenery around Rome is so captivating, and Allen lets us see many historical buildings. The stories we see have no substance, no pull and we wonder why they are there and why was this made. The only good line I found was when someone said of (prostitute)Anna (Penelope Cruz) in a very tight, and obscenely seductive red dress when they were going on a tour of the Vatican: Will they let her in? That was it folks. See? That was the only line I chuckled at. Anna was pretending to be Millie, Antonio's (Alessandro Tiberi) wife due to another mix-up and misunderstanding. Well, you ask where was(newlywed) Antonio's wife Millie? She got lost in Rome and runs into a huge movie star who wants her opinions on things, but in his hotel room. Ahhh! See?Allen,as Jerry, finds Giancarlo (played by opera singer: Fabio Armiliato) his future In-Law, and who he feels is an exceptional opera singer, but can only perform in a shower. Give me a break. And, it is here that the opera singing goes on for way too long at times. My uncle used to sing opera in the truck as we went somewhere. I would always tell him: I think I heard a wounded animal out there.John (Alec Baldwin) appears to Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) who lives with Sally (Greta Gerwig) but has eyes for her friend Monica (Ellen Page) and John seems to tag along with them wherever they go. Sometimes others address him, but at other times it seems he is only visible to Jack. He constantly gives forth his knowledge of life. Was this some form of 'magic' that was so crucial to MIDNIGHT IN Paris? We were not amused. And, Roberto Benigni (yes, you all wondered where he went ) as Leopoldo who is the target of the paparazzi for a reason explained by his one-time chauffeur: they want someone to be famous and they make him so and follow him everywhere. Well, something like that. See, no pull. And, these scenes are clever in the beginning, but go on for too long and become annoying. Not funny. Just annoying. When we see a Woody Allen movie we expect some comedic lines whether the movie is a drama or a comedy that he writes and directs. What we have here are very bland slices of life that have no relevance, hence no pull, but we keep watching because we feel something good will come along and make all the blandness worthwhile. Didn't happen. Yes, this was disappointing. (5/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb spoken by Monica",5,1,2,18 October 2013
Bridesmaids," Extra Rauncy
","Lillian (Maya Rudolph) picks Annie (Kristen Wiig) as her Maid of Honor, but Helen (Rose Byrne) vies for the job anyway and things get way out of control.This could have been a nice movie regarding friendships if the inappropriate and disgusting parts were eliminated. And, there were many. Let's start with the inappropriate and almost x-rated sex act in the opening scenes to the disgusting parts: a woman in a wedding gown defecating in the street ; a woman defecating in a sink of all places; a woman throwing up on the head of another woman also throwing up in a toilet; and language, language, language throughout. Do women really talk this way when by themselves? Billed as a comedy, there was nothing funny in here unless the disgusting parts mentioned row your boat. Women wrote this screenplay and when that happens, they seem to have a tendency to outdo the men to come up with Super-Raunchy stuff and that they did. The only thing that would change these disgusting acts is that they be shown as promos on network TV during prime time. Now, you know that will never happen. The promos only show you the tame stuff and off you go to what you think will be a nice movie regarding friendships and then get the shock of your life. However, there is a nice boy meets girl scenario when Annie meets Officer Nathan (Chris O'Dowd). These scenes are pleasant. And, later when Annie needs Officer Nathan to help find Lillian and she does crazy things in her car toward that end, Nathan won't budge because he was jilted earlier by Annie. These scenes are somewhat comical. Too bad the rest of the movie wasn't like this. Ready for more shocks? It seems that if your character behaves outrageously in a raunchy manner you get a Best Supporting Actress nomination. And, one more: there is also an Oscar nomination for Best Writing for Original Screenplay. Give me a break. (1/10)Violence: No. Sex act: Yes. Nudity: No. Public Defecation: Yes.

Non-Stop," Riveting. Exciting Thriller
","Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is an Air Marshall on an international flight. He receives a text message saying one person will die every 20-minutes unless $150-million is deposited into an offshore account. Marks needs to find the person on board who would do that killing. This is a good opportunity to play detective along with Bill Marks. How good do you think you are? I had no clue. Bummer. Yes, Marks has baggage, but he's dealing with it. The focus is on trying to find the bad guy who is sending all these text messages. Stay focused. Chalk this baggage up to every story has a back-story and this is what we have. Stay focused. All the cast turned in good performances and there are some twists along the way that you may not see coming. There is some CGI and it's very well done although kind of unusual. You'll see. There is suspense and tension all the way through and I was riveted to my seat. This is really good and very entertaining. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

The Grand Budapest Hotel," Disappointing. Not Funny
","Concierge M. Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) is accused of murder of one of the Hotel's more wealthy clients, goes on the run, is captured and goes to prison. Then he escapes. What they showed in the promos were some of the most clever skits and I thought I would enjoy this. Didn't happen. The story was simple enough but the director made it more complicated than it should have been. I believe the idea here was to incorporate fantastic visuals regarding the photography, and cinematography. And, they were fantastic. Visions of SIN CITY and DICK TRACY visuals filled my head at those times. This story was dragged out to the glee of some and no-glee to others including me. Yes, I took a few naps along the way and missed nothing. The dialogues were all monotone which helped the road to slumber land at times. ( Monotone? Really?) Yes. Although billed as a comedy, there was nothing funny in here. A few clever lines, and bewildered looks do not a funny movie make. I won't mention that sometimes the characters spoke so fast I had no idea what was said and just went with it hoping that something later on would translate those dialogues into something that I could understand. But, I won't mention that. HA!The only funny thing I, sort of, laughed at was when Kovacs (Jeff Goldblum) notices that Jopling (Willem Dafoe) throws his cat out the window. More slap-stick in here would have gone a long way to being a funny movie. If no comedic lines would be forthcoming, bring on more slap-stick. Didn't happen. I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes as the Concierge and if he had only been given better comedic lines and rose above the monotone acoustic level, he would have been as fantastic as the photography and cinematography were. Yes, yes, I do understand that his position really wouldn't allow for that butÂ…Â….. Didn't happen. In a word, this turned out to be quite boring. By stifling Fiennes' character Gustave this became, wellÂ…Â…Â… still quite boring. I did recognize Bill Murray as Ivan, Jude Law as the young writer, Jeff Goldblum as Kovacs, and Willem Dafoe as Jopling and they were okay. There were other stars in here with small parts, but they were in camouflage mode and I didn't readily recognize them. See if you can. In the beginning there were hints of sexual hi-jinks with someone being serviced orally and later we see a graphic painting of nude lesbians touching each other. I thought there would be more of this along the way, but the director was still too concerned with the photography and cinematography and as mentioned these were fantastic and we saw no more sexual hi-jinks. This was way too long and lost me often, but keep in mind the focus was to present the photography and cinematography and that was successful. The dialogues were entirely predictable run-of-the-mill utterances. Not good. All in all this was very disappointing and not the class act some think it is. Boo Hoo.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Very Good Action Movie
","Blamed for bombing the Kremlin, the IMF is disavowed (no support) by the US government, but Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) knows Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist) did the bombing and escaped with nuclear launch codes and Hunt also knows he must be stopped from starting a nuclear war. It always amazes me that the bad guys want to blow up the planet and don't seem to realize they will go with it. So what's the point? Here's one more thing that amazed me in this story. The IMF is disavowed, but when they go to Dubai and Mumbai they have all the equipment they need to do the job. So where did all the electronics, magnetic climbing gloves etc come from? And, one more thing that is truly amazing: going about 60-mph or more in a crowded downtown Mumbai. That just doesn't happen. Oh, I almost forgot: there is a sand storm in Dubai and Ethan Hunt is chasing bad guy Hendricks in it. I was amazed at how many other vehicles are still in the storm going very fast although everyone (that would be us) can see that no one can see where anyone is going. Simply amazing. Okay, okay, movie magicÂ…Â…. I hope. All the above aside, this is a very good action movie. The fight scenes with or without CGI were excellent. The acting by all is terrific and yes, Tom Cruise actually does his own stunts. If he keeps it up one day he will be watching someone else do those stunts from a wheel chair. Watching him do those stunts, I have only one thing to say: OUCH, OUCH and OUCH! Hey, I checked myself into the ER after watching him perform those stunts in that automatic car park in Mumbai. I could barely move. We get to see the tallest building in the world in Dubai: The Burj Khalifa building. I got dizzy just looking at it from afar. And, yet Ethan Hunt goes climbing on its windows with magnetic gloves. Again, I couldn't move and tried not to look down.The action is practically non-stop and there is no time for character development. And, if that is what you are looking for, don't watch action movies. Oh, you get bits and pieces and it's up to you to fill in the blanks. Hey, you did it with the James Bond movies. And, to be honest, this Mission Impossible movie is every bit as good as the Bond movies. And, it has that good MI music too. At the end of this we see that Ethan Hunt now has his IMF team and we should see more of them in future movies. Just hope 'dem bones' of Tom Cruise hold up. One of the things I like about the Mission Impossible movies is that when we are told something in the beginning, we buy it and then find out later that what we were told wasn't exactly true. It's like a magician doing his mis-direction thing. I love it, but I cannot tell you what that one thing was. Sorry. This may be the best Mission Impossible movie so far and was very enjoyable and despite some observations above we, who love action movies, should just enjoy what we have. (10/10)Violence: Yes.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Surprisingly Good
","Caesar's mother (a chimpanzee) dies and Will (Franko) smuggles the baby out of the company he works for and cares for him. Will's company is trying to make medicine that will help cure Alzheimer's and they use chimps as test animals. Caesar's mother passed on some the medicine to Caesar and that's when he displays quite a bit of intelligence. This is not your typical Planet of the Apes story. I thought it would be, but I was wrong. This is surprisingly good. You will see CGI like you have never seen it before, perhaps better than in Jurassic Park or just as good. You will think the chimps are real and you will like the main one, Caesar. When you meet some of the others, you may not, but Caesar you will like very much. What's not to like, he's almost human and knows right from wrong. If you watch the DELETED SCENES you will see Andy Serkis as Caesar, but it is not necessary to watch the deleted scenes. The story is well developed and basically there are good people who care for the chimps. And, yes, there is the typical wise -guy who takes pleasure in taunting them. Everything goes along pretty good until Will and Caesar are separated and Caesar goes to live in a controlled Animal Stockade where he mingles with other chimps for the first time. Will is constantly trying to be allowed to take Caesar home, but then things begin to happen that you knew would happen but wished they didn't. And, it now that you think you were right to think this was another Planet of the Apes story. The very last scene will get to you. And, all this will lead you into Part 2, as I am sure there will be one. 8/10.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",8,1,3,17 December 2011
Gone Girl," Too Drawn-out and should have stayed a book
","On the morning of his 5th wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns home from his bar to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing and the house looked like that there was a struggle and there is blood that was cleaned up. He calls the Police and they sympathize for a while, but later they feel that Nick knows more than he is telling. Did he kill his wife? He claims not. I suppose the book was pretty good, this movie not so much. The story had a sort of beginning, and a middle where it stayed for most of the time, too long a time; and although, we in the audience, believed that Nick had nothing to do with Amy's disappearance we couldn't help but get bored with everything as this was really dragged out. The ending is too bizarre to go into at this point. As the police investigate, they find more clues to show that Nick did kill his wife, but everything is circumstantial as there is no body. The police entertain the prospect that Amy was kidnapped and still hold Nick as a person of interest. Nick hires celebrity lawyer Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry) who believes Nick is completely innocent. Nick wants to tell the police that everything looks like he was set up but Tyler Perry won't allow this at the moment. This movie may have had better intrigue and impact if it was much shorter. I am sure the book had erotic moments as we do see some sex scenes, but these scenes were not at all erotic. Again, maybe the book was better, this movie, not so much. Also, there is sexual language, at times, that use the C word along with other f-bombs. The movie does go into what actually happened and this gets dragged out too. We keep asking when will all this come to some conclusion? Hey, we can't stay up all night with this the way it is going. We need our sleep. We come to our conclusion that this should have stayed a book. When we learn everything there is to know we finally get to the ending, which, of course, is dragged out too. It is bizarre and maybe the director or writer was trying to make statements about marriage and the reasons many stay together. You can figure this out and debate it among yourselves. Our conclusion: too drawn-out and should have stayed a book. The acting was okay, and the story may have had better impact if the movie was compacted so we didn't lose interest. (3/10)Violence: Yes.

Django Unchained," Brutal. Serious but with comical moments too
","In order to win his freedom from slavery Django (Jamie Foxx) teams up with Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a Bounty Hunter to hunt down bad guys: The Brittle Brothers. But, what really drives Django is finding Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) his wife, who is rumored to be at the Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) plantation. The year is 1858. Slavery is rampant and so is the 'N' word. Yes, it's very uncomfortable hearing that word constantly. Do we get used to it? No. Do not expect any political correctness in here. Somehow we get used to crude language, which is also rampant, but never the 'N' word. The acting all around is impressive, but it is Leonardo DiCaprio who steals the show even though it takes a while to get to him in here. You remember the title and wait for Django to unleash/unchain himself on evil-doers. Well, you just have to wait a little longer. He'll have his moments, but he needs to cool it while negotiations are going on to free Hilde (Broomhilda). As he has in the past Jamie Foxx proves, once again, that he is a class act. As brutal and serious as this story is there is also a lot of comedy. Witness the KKK riders who complain they cannot see through the eye-holes in the bags covering their heads. There are many other things that create some chuckles as well. There are many, many stars in here, but there is some difficulty recognizing them because many have gained weight, and beards hide their faces. However see if you can pick some out: Don Johnson, Walton Goggins, Tom Wopat, Don Stroud, Russ Tamblyn, Amber Tamblyn (but no beard here), Bruce Dern, Jonah Hill (he was one of the KKK riders), Lee Horsley, Michael Parks, and, keep an eye out for Quentin Tarantino (he should be easy to pick out).As we go along, you would think this is Christoph Waltz's story as his is a very big part. Sameul L. Jackson has a good role as the Head Household slave to DiCaprio's Candie and yes, he found a way to pontificate in here as he has in all his other movies; but he is good at it. Every now and then we get teased with a big western and then nothing after that. Boo Hoo. Let's hope that Quentin Tarantino can bring westerns back, but without the 'N' word. I think we have had enough of it in here. Django was nominated for Best Picture. Christoph Waltz was awarded the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Quentin Tarantino won the Oscar for Writing - Original Screenplay. (9/10)Violence: Yes, quite bloody too in places Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, very briefly when Hilde comes out of the hot box.

Drive," Well Told Thriller
","Drive Driver (Gosling) is a get-a-way driver, a stunt driver, a mechanic and soon to be a race car driver. That is until he meets and falls for Irene (Mulligan) whose husband is in prison and is about to get out. Then the problems start. (here we go) No, no it's not what you think.This is basically a love story with some very good stunt driving and a whole lot of killing over a robbery gone bad.We have all heard the line: no good deed goes unpunished and basically, that is what puts Driver into high gear to help solve a problem. As things go wrong, Driver feels he has to make things right. However, Driver doesn't carry a gun and doesn't know any karate moves; he just drives, and everything he does is for Irene and her little boy. As we go along with him, we are somewhat concerned as to how he is going to fare going up against professional killers. But, it's in the telling that makes this a very good thriller. And, this is very well told.The slow moving scenes are there to help build tension and there is tension galore to jump-start your heart almost from beginning to end. The driving stunts are very good and I don't think CGI was used. Kudos. The acting by all is very good. Some of the killings show bloody gore and in some instances, we witness overkillÂ….Â…and I mean real overkill. And, the music will help get your heart rate up there too. This is all about excitement. Yours and mine. The tension begins with Driver throughout. We know very little about him, we are never given his name, and he doesn't talk much; but we keep hoping he can be a Dirty Harry (without a badge) or a Mel Gibson character protecting his family. But Driver just drives, no gun, no karate. Stares a lot though and when he does that we feel there is more to Driver than we know and we end up not worrying for him so much. StillÂ…Â…Â…The ending confuses me. I thought I knew how this ended. Hey, I was there. I watched it. But, now, I'm thinking they are thinking Drive 2. But, that couldn't be, can't happen.

2012," Woe is Us. Maybe
","The earth is in the process of being destroyed due to extreme sun spot discharges on 21 December 2012. Jackson Curtis (Cusack) does his best to keep his family safe.This is just not a great disaster movie, it is also a glimpse of what many believe will happen to the earth on 21 Dec 2012. Throughout history we have been told about the possibility of this happening: The Mayan Calendar that ends on 21 Dec 2012 and many believe this was a warning to the rest of us, many cultures around the world have a similar foreboding, and, of course, Revelations in the Bible. I don't want to make light of something that very well could happen in 2012, but if it will all come true, kill me now. There will be no place to hide. In the movie, there were huge ships (read Arks). I counted four. And, those fortunate to go aboard have a good chance of surviving the catastrophe. The earth itself isn't going to be completely destroyed, it is just going to resettle itself. There will be Pole shifting. Maybe the South Pole will settle in a place like Leesburg, Virginia. See? You never knowÂ…Â…Â…Â….I thought the movies Live Free and Die Hard and Beowulf had the best CGI, but this one is right up there if not being the very best. One couldn't help thinking that if it all came true, would we see and experience similar scenes of devastation. I choose not to dwell on it. It will be what it will be. Maybe. In real time and the Doomsday scenario aside, the first half of the movie was exciting, but the second half dragged somewhat because it dealt with the human condition of survival. Now, this too is somewhat exciting, but the scenes aboard one of the big ships (read Arks) where the doors can't be closed because something is clogging the gears went on for too long. I guess they needed something more dramatic at the end since no one believed we were too exhausted by the drama in the beginning. But, it went on for too long. This movie was very believable and if you don't think about what may really happen on 21 Dec 2012, you are already on another planet. If you look at this movie as just another disaster movie and believe all this is nonsense, well, good for you. Stay happy and enjoy the CGI and special effects. Now let me pose the question that we would all think about after seeing this movie: should I buy Christmas presents in Dec 2012? The other question I have is: Anyone know where the big boats (read Arks) are? Woe is Us. Maybe. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,2,5,3 March 2010
Peaceful Warrior," Powerful, Worthwhile
","This is based on true events we are told at the beginning.Dan Millman (Mechlowicz) aspires to be an Olympic competitor and his whole life is turned around when he meets Socrates (Nolte) at a gas station one night when he couldn't sleep.I thought this was going to be about a handicapped person who triumphs. After viewing the first few minutes of this, I couldn't think it would be anything else. But, it's not that at all. Dan can't sleep one night and goes for a run and ends up at a gas station for some water. He meets Socrates and is moderately impressed with him. Scott leaves the station, and sees Socrates walk out of the shop and sit in a chair outside. Scott walks on a couple more steps and looks back. Socrates is now standing on the roof of the gas station. How did he get up there in that short a time? Okay, now I was hooked on the movie. You will be too.Yes, it almost seems like a Karate Kid movie with out the karate and in some ways, it is. Socrates takes Dan under his wing and teaches him about life and new values. Dan feels he doesn't need all this philosophy and preaching and resists for a while, but you know he will give in. And, you feel better when he does.Nick Nolte is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and here in this movie he transcends everything he has done before. There is no other way to say it. Scott Mechlowicz looks like Tony Perkins in some ways, but for some reason I kept thinking this was a Keneau Reeves role.Dan Millman is a real person and has written books on spirituality, and enlightenment. Some book titles include The Way of the Peaceful Warrior, and The Journeys of Socrates.To be honest, this is a movie that we should buy and give as gifts. And, the movie is worth seeing more than once and I will do so one day.Violence:Not really, Sex: Some scenes actually show make-outs that don't last long, Nudity: No, Language: No",9,6,9,15 September 2007
The Number 23," Got better in the second half
","Walter Sparrow (Carrey) reads a book his wife, Agatha (Madsen), finds in a used book store and realizes that the main character and he have a lot in common and this scares him. The title of the book is The Number 23. HmmmmÂ…Â…Â…Â…The first half of this movie has you reaching for the DVD remote and the STOP button. Oh, the acting is fine, it was that the story dragged too much. We got the idea pretty quick but the director thought we needed more time with Walter reading the book and conjuring up the episodes within. Those episodes were too dark for anyone to follow and no one knew what was going on anyway. The sex scenes in the beginning and also at the end of the movie really didn't do much to advance the story. A couple cuddling scenes would have made the point.Now, the second half was good, could have been thriller like, but it still lacked the suspense and tension it should have had. Walter is chasing clues regarding the number 23 throughout history and trying to make sense of it all in regards to his inner thoughts that so closely follow the main character's in the story.All in all a good production in the second half of the movie and Jim Carrey is good in dramatic roles (Hey, Will Ferrell, are you listening?). The rest of the cast performed well too.Now, just what is the relevance/obsession between Walter and the number 23? Well, okay, you will learn this early in the movie anyway. He was born on 3 February.Violence:Yes, Sex: Yes, and unnecessary too, Nudity: Yes, Disturbing Images:Many, Language: Yes, some",5,0,1,5 August 2007
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Too Subtle. Bland. Slow. Not Charming and Not Funny
","Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) is about to lose his job as he cannot find negative 25 showing ,we think, Adventurer/Photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn) which would go on the very last cover of Life Magazine. Life Mag is being bought out by another company. What to do? What to do?Before I watched the movie I had these thoughts: Do you daydream? Of course you do. We all do. Do you ever do anything about your daydreams? Probably not. Take heart, Walter Mitty does something about his daydreams. You are in luck. You can live vicariously thru Walter Mitty in this movie. Lucky you. Okay, maybe I daydreamed a bit. And, then I watched the movie and discovered you were not so lucky after all. Sorry. There was no secret life of Walter Mitty. James Thurber is spinning uncontrollably in his grave. We see a few daydreams in the beginning and think this will continue. Sadly no. No time for daydreaming, as he is in the real world and must find the missing negative and he goes off looking for Sean O'Connell in Greenland, Iceland, Afghanistan and the Himalayas. Not sure if the movie was actually shot in these locations or if a Green Screen was used. But, the scenery landscapes were captivating, awesome, and very beautiful. And, his dip into the sea with a shark nearby was pretty good too. What didn't work: The Benjamin Button scene, the drunk helicopter pilot karaoke scenes, the chemistry with Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) and Safe - too safe - dialogues.What would have helped? Traveling or some-such music when Walter goes here and there. Didn't happen. And, a better script with some funny and clever lines too. And, also another movie title as this one is grossly misleading. Normally, when we see a Ben Stiller movie we look forward to his looking like a deer in the headlights.. That's his shtick. It is quite humorous.. Didn't happen. However, we do see a lot Stiller close-ups (but no deer look) of his face - perhaps too many - but he was also the Director and he can do that if he wants. The movie is all monotone, slow and just another slice of life not going anywhere. The supporting cast were all good and Shirley McLaine as Walter's mother makes a short appearance. We did enjoy Sean Penn as he is always good. At the end we get to see the last cover of Life Magazine. And, it will shock you, make you weepy as you reach for the Kleenex box you didn't think you needed. That picture was the only good thing about this movie. It is pure gold. The problem was that we had to go thru everything lame first. Bummer. (5/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",5,5,8,15 May 2014
Across the Universe," Too Long
","Across the Universe Evan Rachel Wood, Dana Fuchs, Jim Sturgess Too LongJude (Sturgess), a young Englishman comes to America and gets involved with Lucy (Wood) who becomes caught up in the Viet Nam War protests.Well, Beatle fans must be happy. They get to hear Beatles music thru most of the movie. Sometimes it worked with the script, sometimes it didn't. Oh, the scriptÂ…Â…Â…wouldn't this have been better if it were produced 20-years ago or so? Right now we are dealing with a more current war (Iraq) and do we really need to go backwards in time and be reminded of more turmoil? Apparently some think so. I do believe that if the Beatles music was not used, this movie would not have been made. Like I said, sometimes the music worked with the script. The music was more than good and what made the music so was the background accompaniment - more instruments than those used by you-know-who. Made a difference with me. The singers were rather good and we were even given a little of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix performed by others, of course. However, there were just too many songs and the story suffered because of that to the point we didn't care about the characters anymore. And, it was just toooooo loooooong. At one point everything was just a kaleidoscope ofÂ….ofÂ…Â…ofÂ… I am not sure what of. The bus trip and aftermath visuals were nice (read boring), but didn't need to be included here. Kind of pointless I thought and it was taking up my time, and remember, I have to get back to watch Judge Judy (TV show).Perhaps if some humor was injected in certain places, maybe, just maybe this wouldn't have seemed too long. I take that back. It still would have. The acting all around was very good when no one was singing. Told you there were too many songs. The movie was nominated for Achievement in Costume Design probably because of that bus trip they all took. Didn't win.And, with a main character (Sturgess) to have a name like Jude in a movie with Beatle songs I guessed correctly what one of last songs would be. Is there a prize for that? ............I thought not.If the truth be known, because of the title I thought I would be seeing a space adventure movie.

I Am Legend," Too Depressing a Story
","Doctor/Scientist Robert Neville (Smith) in New York City is a lone survivor of an escaped man-made virus that killed most of the earth's population and turned many into mutants and he is determined to find a way to reverse the trend. He is immune to the virus. This movie is one of the reasons I do not watch horror movies. I knew it wouldn't be so bad, but it did have some moments. Will Smith is a terrific actor and he provided a believable scenario of a man fighting to find a cure among the mutants who constantly watch him. His scenes with Samantha provided the levity we needed to go further into this very depressing story. I guess somewhere at some time, someone would make this kind of a movie. Yea! Let's all hear it forÂ…Â…. When Hollywood wants to make a depressing movie it really knows how to do it. Something I didn't understand. Neville has all this electronic equipment yet he has no contact with anyone outside NYC? None. One would think that they would be calling in to see how things are progressing with the cure. No contact at all so he talks to Samantha because he believes there is no one out there so he doesn't bother and doesn't' try. He believes he is alone.Also, we see many dead people in the last act they will ever commit. Some are standing, some bent over. You would think the ones standing or bent over would let gravity have it's way. But, no. They are now like statues. Very spooky. Oh, in flashbacks, when Samantha was a puppy, she was of a different coloring than the adult Samantha. I guess they couldn't find the right puppy. Probably thought we wouldn't notice. HA!So the movie is just Neville working on a cure in his lab and escaping from the mutants from time to time until Anna (Braga) comes on the scene. However, good action scenes keep you riveted to your seat and you keep hoping this will all turn out good.The CGI was okay, the stunts were good, the dialogue was good, the cinematography was excellent, but it was all too depressing to have any real entertainment value for me.Violence: Yes Sex: No Nudity: No Language No",6,1,1,25 March 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Terrific. Great Action. Intense
","Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner), a genetically engineered warrior, needs more meds to keep going. The people who ran illegal black ops fear they will be exposed to the government and decide to kill off all these warriors and the scientists who make the meds so they cannot talk. Basically, this is one big chase movie and it is very exciting. The editing during the foot race, car and motorcycle chases later on are fantastic. I am not sure how much CGI was used as everything looked too real. Great stunts. Kudos. The supporting cast of Edward Norton, Stacy Keach, David Strathaim, Scott Glen, and Albert Finney do a credible job just as a supporting cast (hey, it's not their movie) trying to kill off Cross and Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachael Weisz) the doctor who knows how to make the meds Cross needs. The way Cross and Dr. Shearing are tracked by Col Byer (Edward Norton) and crew is really incredible as they have access to cameras and satellites worldwide. Quite smooth the way it was done. I had my doubts about Rachael Weisz in this but she proved more than capable and quite sexy beautiful. She couldn't have been any better. Okay, yes, I fell in love with her. Now, why Jeremy Renner as a new action hero? Did you forget his role in Tom Cruise's movie Mission Impossible, Ghost Protocol? He did a bang-up job in that one looking out for Cruise's Ethan Hunt and had some moves that opened important casting eyes. So it made sense. See?I almost expected a meeting with Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Aaron Cross because in this movie Jason Bourne is alive and doing his thing. They did show Jason Bourne's picture early in the movie and that got me to thinking about a meeting. Didn't happen. But, may in the next movie as you know these sequels will never end. And, that is a good thing. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,28,38,12 December 2012
Unknown," Terrific Mystery Thriller
","Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) goes back to the airport to retrieve his brief case while Elizabeth (Jones) his wife checks into the hotel in Berlin, Germany. On the way to the airport, he is in a car accident, leaves the hospital and goes to his wife who says she doesn't know who he is and her husband (Quinn), the other Dr. Martin Harris, is right there beside her and he can prove he is the real Dr. Martin Harris. Confused? Hey, we all were.I don't think you will figure this one out. But, I will tell you one thing to help: there was a snippet of a conversation between the Martin we know and Elizabeth that may tell you what is going on Â…Â…..but only somewhat Â…Â… and not all. I cannot relate that snippet to you for then you would knowÂ…Â…Â…Â…well, almost know, but not all. Now, after watching the movie, I remembered that snippet and that should have told me something, but it didn't at the time. But, now that snippet makes sense. Of course, you just might stumble onto that snippet. HA! Wait a minute, there were two snippets. Two. OMG.I don't believe you will know 'all' before 'all' is revealed near the end of the movie, but anything is possible. Hey, I'm pulling for you. When I did find out the truth of 'all' it took me by surprise. I had no clue. Along with very good suspense, and tension throughout and not knowing what was going on, I'd say this was a terrific thriller. No, it is better than that, it is a terrific mystery thriller. I kept thinking, like the Martin we know, as to how he can prove he is who he says he is. You may do the same. I was as lost as the Martin we know. You may be too. Like I said, there is mystery to all of this. And, isn't it about time we had a little mystery in these thrillers? Good job. No, terrific job. I don't think CGI was used as the car stunts looked too real for me. They were fantastic. You think you've seen car chases? Not like this one. Kudos to the stunt people. Violence: Yes.

Gran Torino," Good story, some holes
","Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) befriends Tao (Vang) to keep him away from street gangs. Walt is a Korean War Vet and has a sour attitude on just about everything. His wife just died and he is now alone in a neighborhood that has many Korean neighbors and he isn't happy about that. The story is a good one, but there are some holes and maybe this is why no Oscars. What is important in here is what wasn't addressed. His wife. Seems he loved her dearly, but none of her influence had much effect on him. He is mean and sour on everything and everyone including his sons. There were many of her friends at the reception after the funeral at the house, but very few comments about her were heard and Walt wasn't too interested in hearing them anyway. None of her friends came around afterwards. That seemed strange to me. He gains some civility just by interacting with his neighbors and that is a good thing. And, actually, the movie became more enjoyable because of that. Walt's relationship with teenager Sue (Her) was pure gold. Another hole is his confession to Fr. Janovich (Carley). We thought we would learn something about the way Walt is and the guilt he appears to be carrying around with him. We learned nothing. Very weak confession. Again, the wife seemed to be the key regarding what he confessed, but she didn't have that influence either. Another hole, if it could be called that (and you know I do), is his attempt to man-up Tao in front of the barber and the construction boss. It all just seemed over the top and quite unnecessary. Very stilted dialogue here. In a way, embarrassing as well. Other than that, the movie is quite good. It could have been titled Walt or even Kowalski since the story is really about him. The Gran Torino was just the carrot and a reminder to him that there were times when life was good. Also both are one of a kind and no one should change them.This is an exceptional cast and with Mr. Eastwood directing we expect no less. You will have to be ready for much language and ethnic slurs spewed by Walt. Thank goodness the Korean neighbors were very understanding because despite his behavior, language and slurs directed to them, they considered him a very good man. He becomes their protector from the gangs.Maybe because of the way Walt is, you kind of expect Dirty Harry to emerge. Stay tuned.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes. Throughout.

The Hurt Locker," A wake-up call, but.......
","We go on patrols with an EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) team looking for bombs like IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices), and dismantling them.This movie won for Best Picture at the Oscars as well as for Best Director (Kathryn Bigelow) and I have seen all the raves and wonder why. Yes, it is a good movie. Best Picture? No. It is a wake up call showing us how things were done in Iraq in the early days of the war. How things were doneÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…well, the movie shows Sgt James (Renner) in full cowboy mode and I am sure things weren't done the way he performed. In real life, he probably would have been court-martialed for his behavior, wreckless at times. And, that tells me that there was no military consultant to guide the story. There was one instance when Sgt James went out on his own, at night, looking for the suicide bomber that came close to the Green Zone (considered the safest place). This just doesn't happen. But, the Director knew we also wanted to be entertained and we were. Just take a look back, was it really this way? This is not to take anything away from the brave men and women risking their lives in both Iraq and Afghanistan, but the feeling I have is not all the truth was told here. We know our military are not cowboys doing cowboy things while lives, including theirs, are at stake. I suppose if we didn't see Sgt James act the way he did, we would be looking at a documentary only. Good-bye Oscars (well, maybe for a documentary)Now, if you wanted to say that Sgt James was a real person and this is his story, and this is how he acted, then fine, we're good with it. In the beginning it is said War is a drug and for Sgt James it was. This was clear. But does the movie really want us to believe we have cowboys out there looking for another fix? We do know that many go back after their tours are completed, but not to become cowboys. To them war is a drug. But, is this movie saying we have a lot of Sgt James' out there? Seems like it.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Same Old, Same Old, but one new thing
","Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as Spiderman is at it again, this time fighting off 3-new villains that threaten New York City: Electro (Jaime foxx), The Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Then as Peter, he has to be a good boyfriend to Gwen (Emma Stone), please his Aunt May (Sally Field) and tell his best friend Harry (DeHaan) that Spiderman cannot give his blood to help save his (Harry's) life as that could kill him. Where does he find the time? Inquiring Minds want to know. Here we go again. How they can do another '2' is confusing since they have already had '3.' Go Figure. Must be the newer Math. AnywayÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â….. (Hey, it's all in the spelling). Okay. Most of us have heard the saying: 'there is nothing new under the sun.' Well, that is not entirely true. CGI is new under the sun and we see it all the time in movies. This movie revels in CGI (the 10-yr olds love it) and yes, it is fantastic, but truth be told when it goes on for too long we become sleepy. And, yes, it went on for too long too many times. See? Actually, the entire movie went on for too long. There were too many scenes that seemed like the dialogue was dubbed in (unless you had a bad DVD) and it was so distracting I had to rewind to see what I missed. Turns out the dialogues were so lame, I didn't miss anything. Also those dialogues between Peter and Aunt May and Peter and Gwen early in the movie was amateurish and basically silly. They leveled out later on. But, make no mistake, this is basically a love story between Peter and Gwen with Spiderman swinging all over and fighting the villains when he has the time. Coming up later on there will be a very big surprise and you may not like it. Yes, this will be the new thing. One would NOT think that an Oscar nomination could come out of a Spiderman movie, but I believe that Sally Field as Aunt May deserves one for Best Supporting Actress. She was very good. Another Oscar nomination could be for the CGI and the 10-year olds agree. Although Paul Giamatti, as Rhino, didn't have much screen time, I believe he had the time of his life and enjoyed his stint. You go, Paul! You did good. I know they will do another Spider-Man movie in 2018 and if my sock drawer doesn't need reorganizing, I might watch it, or maybe not. I am coming to believe there is no Pull for me in these Spiderman movies; they are the same thing over and over and overÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â….. The only Pull is the CGI and the 10-year olds can't wait. I can.

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," It was okay
","I now know why Vampires live forever. Movie Producers won't let them die. When we last saw Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson) they were in love and Bella knows all. So really there was no need for a sequel, but now Edward tells Bella they cannot be together. Bella is crushed. And, a new wrinkle has emerged and his name is Jacob (Lautner), and he is in love with Bella and he has a secret too. Secrets abound and Bella is caught in the crossfire. Sounds like one of your soaps, doesn't it?Return with us now to those chilling days of Vampireville, where Vampires rule again. The first half of this movie was very slow, disappointing and the acting suffered as did we all. Someone needed to put some life into the main characters, and wake them up and tell them a movie is being made. Yes, the situation was serious but heyÂ…Â… There were many, many scenes that contained too much silence, and hesitations as perhaps there wasn't enough dialogue to cover things. Dragging out these scenes had us looking around to see what was playing next door, and many of those scenes had no music to help things along. The Director did pass Movie Making 101, didn't he? Maybe he didn't see Heaven's Gate with those ever slow drawn out scenes. The second half had more life, with some pretty good fight scenes and CGI as well. The movie saves itself. This was okay, but hopefully, the next segment to this series will be as good as the first Twilight movie was. Let's hope. And, let's hope Ms Stewart can conjure up more than one facial expression.The very last scene indicated to us there will be another sequel. We may have to chose up sides: Team Edward or Team Jacob.

Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Bad and not in a good way
","A wedding, and a Silver Surfer comes streaking in across the sky to mess things up. The Surfer comes to prepare planet Earth for destruction. Can't he wait until the vows are said? Can the Four save the planet? Will the wedding ever take place again? Some Inquiring minds want to know.One would think that The One who made the movie would watch it before putting it out there for Other Ones to see. If The One had done that The One would have seen that the voices all sounded dubbed in and everyone acted like they were in a dream-state and hence no excitement was to be found. And, The One would go back to the drawing board. The One didn't do that and here we are with something kids would only groove on when the CGI kicked in if they waited for the Silver Surfer to appear. And, the CGI was very good, but it cannot a movie make.This was like a rehearsal, a walk thru. Was I the only one to see it that way? I think people who do movies on comic-book superheroes need to get away from the comic-book dialogue. It works for the comics, but not in the movies that I watch. I noticed that most critics who get paid to watch this stuff said this one was better than the first one. No, it wasn't. The CGI was better but as I said that doesn't make it a movie. The actingÂ…..well, let me put it this way: the acting was like everyone showed up and knew a few lines and then waited around for someone to feed them the rest of the story so to speak.It is said this was for the kids. Give me a break, the kids would have boogied long ago.Now, why did I bother to watch this movie? Why to see Jessica Alba of course. But, she added nothing to the show. Absolutely nothing.

Grudge Match," Enjoyable and Funny
","Each winning one fight, former rival Pro Boxers Razor Sharp (Stallone) and Billy the Kid (DeNiro) consider a re-match 30-yrs later. And, there is a reason they don't like each other. I didn't think this would be any good at first, but this movie made sense because both Stallone and DeNiro starred in fight movies in the past: the Rocky series and Raging Bull. However, this was very enjoyable and a lot of fun. Many LOL funny lines throughout helped by toe-tapping music in the beginning and an excellent supporting cast of Kevin Hart as Dante Slate: fight promoter, Alan Arkin as Lightning Conlon: Sharp's trainer, and Kim Basinger as Sally: the love interest. And, it is here that De Niro shines with comedic lines and Stallone had his share as well as did Kevin Hart who kept everything upbeat. Quite funny at times. Kudos.And, a shout-out should go to screen writers: Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman as both combined to do funny stuff. There are some bumps in the road, too, and we get sub plots that almost stop the fight from happening, but the fight does go on. The fight scenes were pretty good too. Nothing like the Rocky or the Raging Bull fights, but good nevertheless. No disappointment here. The acting performances all around were very good. A cameo by Rich Little as the Ring Announcer was a nice touch. And, we see Evander Holyfield and Mike Tyson as themselves at the end of the movie. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Long, but a touching and beautiful story
","Benjamin (Pitt) is born and looks about 80-yrs old, the mother dies, and the father hustles it to another part if town. The baby is found, cared for and begins to grow younger as time passes.I did my best not to watch this movie. I figured it would be something like the TV show Mork and Mindy and Johnathan Winters thing back in the day. I just didn't see any sense to it. I was wrong. Oh, I still don't see any sense to it, but after watching it, I have come to see that it is a very touching and beautiful story, great cinematography and extremely well acted by all especially by Brad Pitt. And, if truth be told here, the dialogue wins too. It was fantastic, quiet, respectful, honest and, at times, offered many humorous linesÂ…Â….some of them the laugh-out-loud variety. Yes, it is too long and to think that it came from a Short Story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Must have been some story to have a movie last almost 3-hours. Looking back, I can see where many scenes could have been shortened, not cut out: shortened. Now, how did this happen, how did Benjamin grow younger with time (and look like the Brad Pitt we know. Sorry, couldn't resist)? Well, it all had to do with a Clock-Maker making a clock in a big Railroad Station run backwards. He had lost a son in the war and the only way to bring him back was to reverse time. So there is your correlation and this gives us a very touching and beautiful story. That is what F. Scott Fitzgerald wanted to have happen. And, it didÂ…..in this story. But, he was also telling us that every life is precious. And, we benefited. I would have voted this as Best Picture.I came to think of another movie that took me a long time to watch too. FARGO. Now, it's part of my top ten as is this one. But, they could have shortened it some without taking anything away from it. Violence: Yes.

Lincoln," One of the best historical stories on film ever
","Hey, if you are looking for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer, that is another movie (not bad btw).Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) needs to pass the 13th Amendment (abolishes slavery) to the U.S. Constitution because he feels his Emancipation Proclamation will not have the power of law when the Civil War is over. If things didn't happen this way, well, they should have. This is probably one of the best historical stories on film ever. I almost got the impression that Lincoln came back and inserted himself into Daniel Day-Lewis or if that is too unbelievable: maybe when the DVD is inserted we actually go back in time and see how things unfolded. Or what about this: Daniel Day-Lewis channeled Lincoln and there you are. Take your pick. However it happened, I really believed I was watching the real Lincoln, and I was riveted. Slow, draggy? Not for me and it shouldn't be that for you. And, as Lincoln was a master story-teller you will especially like the one about Ethan Allen visiting England, and he needs to use the Water Closet (bathroom) and sees a picture of George Washington hanging within. You will LOL at his reply when the British asked him if that was an appropriate place to hang the George Washington picture. We have heard a lot about the Emancipation Proclamation but almost nothing about how the 13th Amendment came to be. This movie takes care of that for all time. I put Daniel Day-Lewis on a par with Woody Harrelson because both always give Oscar winning performances and should be given the Oscar even before the movie is shot. That's how good each is. I guess you can tell that I am in awe of both. Daniel Day-Lewis did win the Oscar for Best Actor. Kudos. All the cast members should be given some kind of award that not only serves to uplift this version of history but also allows them to say they really and actually were a part of our history. I cannot emphasize too much how real this was for me. Kudos to director Steven Spielberg.There is a scene where Lincoln is sitting, thinking and looking at his watch. You hear the watch ticking. This is the actual watch that Lincoln had and it was borrowed from the museum for this shot. You can actually hear the ticking as Lincoln heard it. How good is that? Spooky, eh?The cinematography, dialogues were spot on. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only two F-bombs and not much soft stuff: GDIs and the S-word.",10,0,4,29 March 2013

Harriet disappeared and there has been no trace of her since. Computer hacker Lisbeth (Rapace) hacks into Mikael's computer and provides clues to help solve the mystery. Mikael has 6-months before he goes to jailI know Hollywood is about to do the American remake of this film, but if you want to see a really engaging and well done story by actors who deserve Oscars, then go get this one. There are sub-titles, but they are short and not at all distracting. However, of course, if you know the Swedish language then the sub-titles would probably be a distraction. This is probably the most engaging mystery thriller I have seen since The Ghost Writer. And, as you may have heard, the book and the movie are an international hit. We are talking 2.5-hrs long and you wish it were longer. When the Hollywood version comes out you can see it again and compare. Both leads are terrific, but you cannot take your eyes off a very pretty Noomi Rapace when she is on the screen, and I do hope her tattoos are washable. She steals the show. She is one of those actresses who can say a lot with her eyes as well as her actions. The cinematography is excellent. Good lingering shots of some really beautiful landscapes and I must mention a terrific shot of a big, beautiful, curvy, white bridge when Mikael and Lisbeth take a ride to investigate more clues. It's beautiful but scary (well, for me anyway). You'll see if you do the Swedish version.What was also enjoyable was that the music, while excellent, didn't rush the action on the screen. The dialogues were somewhat understated and this gave them more credence, honesty and power. Even though the actors spoke Swedish, you could feel the impact of the dialogues. Simply great. There is some sex stuff. Lisbeth is forced to orally service her guardian, there is a rape scene, and another sex scene. Overall, a very engaging mystery and you don't want it to end because you really like Mikael and Lisbeth, especially Lisbeth. Now, I can't wait for the Hollywood remake.

He will do this by competing in a MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) contest. Even if he loses he gets a big check and that is what he counts on. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!This is not a comedy, but there are funny things going on. Remember when you laughed when you saw someone slip on a banana peel? This is almost the same thing. The fight bouts in here will give you those kind of laughs as the choreography for these bouts is pretty good.

But, everything comes down to the big fight at the end in Las Vegas, Nevada. Yes, how Voss gets that far is hard to believe, but there it is, there he is and there you are hoping he wins, and not lose for that pay check. The scenes near the end will have you standing up and cheering (yes, you read that correctly) even before the big fight? How? Just watch and see.

Clash of the Titans," Disappointing
","Mankind is challenging the gods and Zeus (Neeson) doesn't like it. So to teach them a lesson Zeus allows Hades (Fiennes) to bring disruption to the earth. But the god/man son of Zeus, Perseus (Worthington) sees the good in mankind and has plans to defeat Hades. It took a long time for me to see this movie. I just knew it would be all CGI showing fighting against all kinds of creatures. I was not wrong, but giant Scorpions? And truth be told, there was really nothing else out there. The CGI is nothing but terrific, but give me a break. Too much CGI gets boring pretty quick. It puts me into sleepy-time mode as it never seems to stop (insert a Big Yawn here).To review the main actors, Liam Neeson seemed to be miscast and he seemed to be wary that he was indeed Zeus. Well, if he couldn't believe it, we couldn't either. And, it would have helped more if his hair was white. We like gods with white hair because it shows the gods have what we lack: wisdom (insert Bewilderment look here).Ralph Fiennes was pretty good as Hades. He needed more scenes as he was truly a breath of fresh air (insert Almost Curious look here).Sam Worthington as Perseus was okay but he was too busy deflecting attention to others in the cast. We hardly knew ye Perseus (insert What the Hell You Doing look here).We also saw creatures who were mostly blue, and Zombie-like, but they could fight and had mysterious powers (insert Who the Hell Are They look here). We could have accepted them if when they talked we could understand them, but we couldn't. It was like listening to someone who is talking but all we hear is a lot of grunting. Not good (insert What the Hell Are You look here).So there you have it. Another remake that should not have been made, 'but we have all this CGI technology and what do they (that would be us) know?'I would call this disappointing.

The Adjustment Bureau," Highly Entertaining
","The Adjustment Bureau exists to make sure everything happens according to Plan explains Richardson (Slattery). David Norris (Damon) sees these people making adjustments on fellow workers, runs, is chased and captured. They explain to David what will happen to him if he tells anyone what he saw. They also tell him that he cannot be with Elise (Blunt), the woman he just met. It's not part of the Plan. What to do? What to do? So now I get it. I now know why the girl I asked to marry me did not, could not, would not. It all makes sense now. Also, I know the reason I do not, can not and will not ever win a big money lottery. Yes, it is all very sad, but also very clear. Now I get it. There are people out there helping us make the right decisions. Wait a minute, that can't be right. We have free will. Right! Don't we? Tough Room!This is a highly entertaining and engaging story. I especially like the honest dialogue from all parties. The pacing was just right. The cinematography was outstanding. Could have used a little more humor. There was some, but more wouldn't have hurt. The men of the Adjustment Bureau were like the Men In Black, except they were notable for their hats. The hats are very important. The music near the end when David is running was exceptional. I was toe tapping to beat the band and I never do that. This was a very creative effort. I mean this story is big, bigger than inventing or reinventing the wheel. See? Really big. That is, if you believe. Until the day we die, we may and will ask ourselves: predestination or free will. What do we have? Huh?The acting was perfect due to the actors, of course, but mostly, it was the dialogue that made everything seamless. I was also most impressed by Anthony Mitchell who played Harry (one of them) who tries to help David from time to time. I liked the way he knew what his job was, yet you could see in his eyes that he had reservations. Very good. And, Terrance Stamp as Thompson, one of the chiefs of that Bureau, what can I say? He is perfect under any circumstances. Emily Blunt: was that her really doing those dance moves like she had no bones in her body? Outstanding. And, when John Slattery talks, I believe every word he utters. As for Matt Damon, he is finally getting his due other than the Jason Bourne roles, although I wouldn't mind another. Anyway, now I know. It all makes sense to me nowÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….They are out there making sureÂ…Â…..Violence: Not really. OK, a car accident only.

The Hangover Part II," Still Raunchy and Still NOT Funny
","The same group of friends that were in Hangover 1 set out for Stu's (Helms) wedding in Thailand. And, as before, of course, they enjoy a last drink with Stu as a single man. And, of course, three of them Phil (Cooper), Alan (Galifianakis) and Stu wake up the next morning in Bangkok, miles away from the wedding site. And none of them, of course, can remember anything of what happened the night before and Teddy (Lee) is not with them and where is he?The formula is the same. They find a clue where to go and at each place they go to they are told of their bad behavior the night before and somehow come up with another clue toward solving the mystery. And, of course, they remember nothing. Now, all this wouldn't be so bad if the things I witnessed didn't come to pass. When you try too hard to be funny, you fail. And, they failed big time. There is no other way to say it. Touted as a comedy, I found nothing funny in here. I witnessed a lot of raunchy bathroom behavior that many call humor, a lot of overacting, frontal nudity of both male and female bodies, and raunchy sex language throughout. And, will someone please tell me what Galifianakis' claim to comedy fame is. I do not find him even remotely funny. And, as I mentioned in my H1 review, he was very good in a dramatic role in IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY. Yet, he continues to try comedy. Go figure. The only breath of fresh air was Mr. Chow (Jeong). Yes, he had the potty mouth (as most did) too, but his delivery kind of livened up the place. He's pretty good. And, to finish off the formula, you just know a camera will be found that shows pictures of all them and what they did the night before when they couldn't remember anything the next day. And, of course, many of those pictures are really crude. Of course. The Hangover 2 had to be made because they realized that Hangover 1 was not funny when they promised laughs. Well, not funny except for the taser scenes in front of children as they were LOL funny. But, I guess the joke (give me a break) is on them because this was not funny either. Will there be a H3 to make things right? Stay tuned. (2/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, male and female frontal. Raunchy Sex Talk: Throughout. Language: Throughout",2,0,3,17 December 2011
Prisoners," Riveting, but misdirection of clues is the reason
","The daughters of the Dovers and the Birches go missing after a Thanksgiving Day Dinner. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) fears the police have to release Alex (Paul Dano) for lack of evidence but something Alex said to Keller leads Keller to believe Alex knows about the abduction and may have had a hand in it. He is livid. The Police are not convinced. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) vows to find the girls.Loki? That name reminds me of the Norse God, Loki. Why use that name in here; and while we are at it the name Keller Dover doesn't exactly roll off the lips. Okay, it's out of my system. This is a good movie and it's 2 Â½ hours long. Why so long? You will discover why when you are finished with the movie and you look back and then understand that many of the clues were a misdirection and had nothing to do with solving the case. Of course, there are good clues too, but you will decide which ones were good or bad after you walk away from this. I cannot tell you which ones were entirely used to confuse the audience. That would be telling. But, in the meantime, you are riveted to your seat because you also are trying to figure out who kidnapped the girls and where they are either dead or alive. There is some torture in here when Keller Dover kidnaps Alex because Keller is convinced Alex knows all. Keller Dover is driven and this comes out easily by Jackman as he is good at this. Detective Loki - that name again â€“ (thought it was out of your system) goes about his business in a methodical/logical way tracking down clues as they arise. We keep waiting for that look Gyllenhaal gives when he puts a puzzle together. You know that look: his eyes widen really wide. We wait, and wait, and wait. The supporting cast of Viola Davis as Nancy Birch, Terrance Howard as Franklin Berch, Maria Bello as Grace Dover do credible jobs. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal give outstanding performances. That's to be expected. Kudos. A shout-out must go to the make-up person who worked on Paul Dano as Alex showing the results of torture. Really scary. We cringed and felt the pain just looking at him. Good job. Again, this is still a good movie and you are ready to give it an 'A' rating until you realize you were also kidnapped and held prisoner for 2 Â½ hours all because of a magician's - now a director's - trick of misdirection.

The Dark Knight," Terrific
","The police and the Dark Knight (Bale) believe they have the crime situation under control in Gotham. Then along comes the Joker (Ledger).I must say I am surprised and pleased that the story was not all about the villain, the Joker. It was a good mix between Batman and the Joker, and all the cast performed extremely well. Yes, there are a couple loose ends that were not tied up. The young accountant who knows the secret identity of Batman . What happened to him? And, whatever happened to the Joker? We didn't see him die (What? Sequels? Ah!)There is a picky point. How do you not know there are drums of oil in the engine room of both ferry boats? How do you not know this as a member of the boat working in the engine room? This seemed to me to be the dumbest part of the story. All was good: the cinematography, CGI, real stunts, dialogue and the music. I have heard that the music will be nominated for an Oscar. It was okay but I wouldn't go that far.It wouldn't bother me if Heath Ledger posthumously wins an Oscar for his Joker. He was very good. But, so too was the make-up artist who painted Ledger's face. It was simple but most effective because it was scary. Did Caesar Romero ever look as scary as the Joker in the TV series? What about Jack when he played the part? I think not.The movie is too long. At times it felt like a weekly serial the times the Joker was allowed to escape, except it wasn't weekly, it was 2.5-hours in real time. Still good, but long. At least the CGI and regular stunts didn't last forever like they sometimes do in action movies. And, they were very good too.I have to go back and watch Batman Begins to see if Bale uses the throaty voice to disguise his Bruce Wayne voice as he did here. I don't remember that. Violence: Yes.

Elysium," Good Sci-Fi, but too many fight scenes
","It's 2154. The Haves live on Elysium, a space station above earth. The Have-Nots live on a ravished, diseased and over-populated Earth below. Max (Matt Damon) who lives on Earth catches a fatal dose of radiation and is told by a robot he has 5-days to live and is given some pills for the pain. There is a plan to have Max go to Elysium for a cure and also to download security information so the people on Earth could go to and enjoy Elysium too. Right now the people on Earth are considered non-citizens and it is illegal for them to go to Elysium. Max's arm is imprinted with a counterfeit stamp to show he is a citizen of Elysium. Webster's says Elysium is ' a place or condition of ideal happiness.' Well, as you would expect, things go wrong and most of the movie shows fight scenes with Max trying to get to Elysium and then many fight scenes when he is on Elysium. Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a hit-man for Secretary Delecourt (Jodi Foster) relishes in shooting down shuttles from Earth that try to go to Elysium. Kruger concentrates on Max, who now has all the Elysium security info implanted in his head and because of that Kruger cannot kill Max because Delecourt needs that info to change the current Elysium government she considers too soft. We don't get to know too much about any of the characters except for Max. We see Delacourt as a real Biaaatch who has no compassion for anyone. Robot builder John Carlyle (William Fichtner) needs long term contracts with Elysium and agrees to help Delacourt change things. And, not exactly a love interest, we see Frey (Alice Braga) a longtime childhood friend of Max and she has a child who has Leukemia and needs to go to Elysium for the cure. Frey and child complicate Max's mission. In the beginning we see amazing beautiful sets of Elysium and later on we see more very good, but darkened sets, and this time as background for all the fight scenes that dominate the movie. There were just too many fight scenes when we needed to take a breath. We would have liked to have seen more of other characters and of Elysium as everything seemed perfect there. We like to see perfect things. Was surprised to see William Fichtner look like a 25-yr old. There is that technology now to make people look younger than they are. I don't have a problem with that but I almost didn't recognize him at first. I think Jodi Foster looked quite young too. Kudos. The acting all around is very good, but sometimes we had a hard time understanding Kruger's dialogues. That is, except when he went on a foul language tirade, then we understood him pretty good. I can see you have a question regarding Matt Damon and the answer is yes, the Jason Bourne character does come out of him but in this movie it takes more time to get the job done.

Taken," Excellent Thriller
","Former gov't spy Bryan (Neeson) reluctantly lets his daughter Kim (Grace) go to Paris only to find out she has been taken upon landing by a gang specializing in prostitution. He flies to Paris to find her.The pace of this movie and the caring win hands down. It is fast but not so fast you don't know what is going on and we care as well. We want Bryan to find his daughter no matter what it takes and there is no political correctness in here as witnessed by the torture scene. For a movie to get us to care so much in the beginning is unusual indeed and a compliment to Neeson and Grace as both exhibited exceptional chemistry. This was perhaps the fastest hour and a half I have experienced in a long time. He knows his window of getting her back is small. As each obstacle rose up it was like I was pushing Bryan to get it over with quickly and on the next path to finding his daughter. It was almost interactive in that way. Cool. And, when he gets captured (he WHAT?) and about to be killed, I really didn't see a way out. But, I really believe sitting on the edge of the chair looking for an edge helped somewhat (Hmmmm).There was one flaw I saw (there you go, ruining it now) and that was when the French Detective pulled a gun on Bryan not knowing the bullets had been removed. Any pro can tell if the gun is loaded with a clip of live bullets and holding a gun with a clip with no bullets. It's not as heavy. Everyone knows that (HmmmÂ…..). But, hey this is the movies. All in all an excellent thriller. The entire cast performed well. You know what is going to happen and you enjoy every fast NY minute of it. Violence: Yes.

Alice in Wonderland," Okay, but not for small children
","The story takes up when Alice (Wasikowska) is about 18-yrs old, leaves a party after being asked to marry, sees a rabbit in a waist coat, follows the rabbit and falls down the hole again, but this time into a world called Underland. She has no memory of being there before.If I were a child again and watched this adult version of Alice, I would go to bed every night with a light on. There was nothing wonderful about it. It was sort of scary, menacing, confusing, and frightful. Hey, when scary animals show their teeth in a menacing way I want no part of it even as an adult. Oh, the dialogue was good for the most part, but when we really get into the story and meet the Red Queen (Carter) we see no reason for children to see this. The Red Queen is mean as opposed to the White Queen (Hathaway) who is super nice. I forgot how many times the Red Queen shouted out, 'off with his/her head.' There is a way to be mean or not nice without being mean or not nice. Really, and the trick would have been be to incorporate some humor with the supposed meanness. See? Didn't happen. I didn't see this in 3-D but on a DVD. Not sure if 3-D would have helped, but there is a awful lot of detail regarding colors etc in here.I suppose the whole idea of the story is to transform Underland into Wonderland again and restore the White Queen to the throne. But to do that Alice needs to defeat the Jabberwocky, a fire breathing dragon. Is action hero Alice up to the job? HmmmmÂ…..The acting throughout was very good. I wouldn't have minded if Johnny Depp (Mad Hatter) was more animated and I think he should have been. He could have been the comic relief that was missing throughout. Didn't happen. He was too serious a Mad Hatter. His put-on smile doesn't count. On the whole not bad, but not for small children. Let them read or read to them the original Alice in Wonderland and let it go at that. You know, having a night light on at night isn't such a bad idea anyway. HmmmmÂ…Â…..

Avatar," Best Picture. Best Director. Really.
","Marine Corporal Jake Sully (Worthington) is drafted to become part of the Avatar Program on Pandora. He is put into a capsule and emerges on the planet as a 10 or 12-foot tall Navi native of Pandora, (but he is still in the capsule. See?). The US is there for a valuable mineral needed. The problem is the Navi are sitting on top of it and the US needs them to move so the US can mine it. Sully's job is to get the Navi to move. I now know why Avatar didn't win Best Picture and Best Director. The Academy never saw the movie. They heard so much about it by word-of-mouth they felt like they had seen it. Then, Ms Bigelow and a S.W.A.T. Team captured the entire Academy in a room and wouldn't let them out until she had Best Picture and Best Director in a slam dunk for the Hurt Locker. Pretty sure it went something like that. I didn't watch it in 3-D. But, this is a visual treat regardless of what dimension you watch it in. There are not worthy and adequate words to describe what you will see. You have never seen anything like the visuals in this movie. You will, as I did, rediscover the color Blue. Also, the CGI is absolutely spectacular. James Cameron, the Director, is truly a genius.Yes, the first half is a visual feast for your eyes. In the second half, the real story starts and as you may suspect, a war breaks out. Unless I missed something in the beginning, I never once heard anyone talk about Negotiations between the US and the Navi. It's possible I missed that because the beginning went by so fast, I had the feeling someone assumed I knew about Pandora, the Navi, the Avatar Program, the hi-Tech equipment and the robotics. I didn't know what the word AVATAR meant. And, exactly where is Pandora? That word-of-mouth didn't reach me. As soon as those 3-D TV sets become available and affordable I will get the 3-D glasses and give this another go.Oh, this is a movie you may want to buy, but wait. Wait until some time goes by and another copy will come out telling you this one includes deleted scenes or scenes never seen before. That's the one you want to purchase. Violence: Yes.

The Artist," We Were Misled
","This movie depicts the dawning of the AGE of the Talkies. Big name silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) doesn't like it one bit. In the beginning, George smiles a lot and so do you. And, when Peppy (Berenice Bejo) comes on the scene there are more smiles. It's a contagious thing like yawning. Then the studio wants to do talkies and the smile is gone from George, who wants to continue to do silent films. Now, the rest of the story is a real downer. What happened? The promos didn't show this. Yes, the story is sad in too many respects as we don't like to see anyone lose work especially when someone is very good at his job. Poor George just won't get with the program and progress. While it may have been true that many silent film stars had a too high a vocal timbre and wouldn't have been allowed to speak in talkies except to act in non-verbal shots, this was not the case with George. George's problem was George. He was in a comfort zone and nothing would remove him from it. But, wait a minute: there is something you will hear at the end of the movie that was, perhaps, the real reason George wouldn't do talkies. He had a French accent. Could this be the real reason? We'll never know. We were misled. The promos and all the other hype indicated this would be a fun movie. Not so. For most of the movie we are watching a man down on his luck and barely scraping by and, of course, we kept hoping things would change for him. But, the way this was going I abandoned that hope. This was too sad. The promos misled us again. The movie won a lot of Oscars and I am not sure why. For my money, the promos should have been awarded the Oscars. They were fun, witty, and the music was toe-tapping good. Okay, to be fair, the music deservedly did win for original score. The acting, in my opinion, was not Oscar worthy for anyone, but the performances all around were very good and that was not the problem. The problem was the plot. It was too sad, and not very entertaining. Hey, here we are sitting around in silence and this wasn't going the way we thought it would. Sound does come into play at certain parts, and you wished for more, but all we see is George moping around everywhereÂ…Â…silently. What would have made this somewhat better (with or without sound) was film critics and Variety reporters chiming in, big studio bosses discussing the situation with and about George not wanting to do talkies and maybe Peppy (whose star was rising in the talkies) trying harder to get through to George. This would have given the film more depth. Didn't happen. Now, nothing was given away as we all know that talkies were the coming thing. You knew that, right? We just wanted to see the promos again, not the movie. Okay, what we really wanted was a happy ending, but we were taken on a very long, non-scenic, agonizing - are we there yet? - route. This was, indeed, over-hyped and over- rated. We were misled. (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, not even in the subtitles.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," Lame
","Bella (Kristen Stewart) is now a full-fledged Vampire with baby. Someone sees Bella's daughter, Renesmme, -that's a real name? - act in such a manner that the person believes the child was turned. Aro (Michael Sheen) the head Vampire of the Volturri (Vampire royalty) is so informed. Turning a child is against Vampire Law and the penalty, if the charge is true, is death for both mother and daughter. Well, here we are. At the end. Thankfully. About time. Hopefully. Please let this be the end of it. I can't do it anymore. PleaseÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…Let's recap: The first one was good. We saw Edward (Robert Pattinson), the Vampire, woo Bella and Bella wanted him to turn her. Edward wouldn't do it. Then, Breaking Dawn Part I: was really about nothing but getting all of us into the theaters again, but Bella got her wish and was turned.Breaking Dawn Pt II. Bella likes being a Vampire and does all the acrobatics that she saw Edward do in earlier parts. She is loving life. Ooops, can I say that?Most of the movie is Bella and Edward convincing their Vampire friends that Renesmme (Mackenzie Foy) was not bitten, hence not turned. Will the Volturri believe this? Will war break out? Inquiring minds, you see.Let's get to it: here is my problem with this movie. Seemed like ALL - with one exception: Aro - acting performances were of the wooden ilk. All behaved like they were in a trance. The dialogues appeared to be dubbed in. Watch their mouths closely and you will see there is a space between the spoken word and movement of lips. I couldn't help but noticing this as it was blatantly obvious. And, lastly, I kind of got the impression that Jacob (Taylor Lautner) will wait for Renesmee â€“ really, a real name? â€“ to become an adult. See where this is going? I thought Vampire reflections could not be seen in a mirror, but we see Bella and Edward's looking at their reflections in a mirror. (What are you doing? You know there are no such things as Vampires)Michael Sheen's character Aro was THE breath of fresh air in here and we wished he had a bigger part. The CGI was okay. Let's face it, this movie definitely needed CGI. In case you missed past Twilight movies, we are given a short recap of them at the end. This kind of takes your attention off this Breaking Dawn Pt II, which is truly lame. Anyway, take a breath, it's all overÂ…Â…Â…Â….it is, isn't it? I don't think I can do it again.

Invictus," A Class Act on a Grand Scale
","Based upon a true story.After almost 30 years of imprisonment, Nelson Mandela (Freeman) becomes President of South Africa and makes it his mission to forgive his suppressors and to unite the country, both black and white, through the sport of Rugby. Rugby. Almost like American football except there don't appear to be many rules, no pads, no helmets, no instant replay, no forward pass and no cheerleaders. Bummer.Invictus is a poem by William Ernest Henley and the last two lines sum up everything: I am the master of my fate. I am the captain of my soul. Mandela used the poem to not give in or give up to anything while he was in prison regardless of the hardships he endured there. This is a class act on a grand scale and may be Clint Eastwood's most important film. Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon deserved the Oscar nominations as they and the entire cast were outstanding. Maybe the concentration on Rugby was too much and nothing was mentioned about the other duties of the new South African government, but President Mandela needed to unify the country before he could feel confident the whole country was behind him on other matters. It worked. He and the South Africans win. Wouldn't it be nice if nations could use sports to vent whatever they feel they need to vent. And, if they lose, well, there's always next year.We didn't get any insight into Mandela's daughter who couldn't get over the white South Africans as also part of the new government. She kept remembering that they were the ones who threw the Mandela family out of their house. After the Rugby match, did she see the wisdom of what President Mandela accomplished with Rugby? This was not addressed. Nevermind playing Rugby, watching parts of a Rugby game in a movie isn't easy either, you know. I did some damage to my knee and right elbow watching some of the hits. I could become a Rugby fan if they had more rules, pads, helmets, instant replay, the forward pass and, of course, cheerleaders (but, Bob, that's American Football). Exactly.

Super 8," Pretty Good
","A group of kids start to make a movie with a Super 8 camera by railroad tracks when they witness a huge train derailment. In time they come to realize it was no accident.This is basically a kids movie with some language: S-words and one F-bomb. Not good. The director was good in making an almost Disney movie with kids (the way they used to), but the language? Why? Why? Why? Other than that mis-step, this was pretty good.However, if you are a Kyle Chandler fan, and I am, this is not his movie. The movie belongs to Elle Fanning as Alice and to Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb and the other kids who all performed well. Chandler is Jackson Lamb the town's deputy and he was excellent. He was at wits end trying to figure out what was happening in the town with people, dogs, power lines, car engines and microwaves disappearing; and he could get no answers from the military who had taken over the town. Elle Fanning is becoming a major force in movies. Look out Dakota.The CGI, cinematography and dialogues were all good. That train derailment was spectacular. Near the end of the movie there was a bit of a continuity problem. The kids are in the underground cave and trying to get out, and the next scene has them on the main street of the town watching a space ship being built by the alien. Oh, you didn't know an alien was involved? Now you do. Not a big mystery here and you will have figured that out early on anyway. And, the promos seemed to give that awayÂ…Â…Â….Stay while the credits run and you will see the Super 8 movie the kids made. It lasts a couple minutes and is rough but funny. Violence: Yes.

Up," Give me a break
","Carl (Asner) and Ellie meet, get married, can't have kids, she gets ill and dies. Carl blows up balloons to lift the house to Paradise Falls in South America, a place he and Ellie always wanted to go. This is a tear jerker, and really not for kids. The first 25 minutes will tear your heart out. This is a love story and you are reminded of that every step of the way all the way to the very end. Yes, Ellie dies, but the love lives on. Now, this is okay, but keep a box of Kleenex around. Maybe two. You like to see kids cry? What about seeing adults cry? HmmmmÂ…Â….. The promos have you believing this is a wonderful kids story. It's not. This is quasi adult story told via a cartoon. Cartoons appeal to kids. I rest my case. Okay, to be fair, maybe most kids won't notice the love story, the illness, the dying and that's fine, but this is not the Disney I came to know through the years. Not at all. The story continues and things happen and you forget about Ellie for about 2-minutes; then Carl, who always has Ellie on his mind, remembers something about her and there you are again reaching for the Kleenix. I must say it is astounding how fast we latch onto the deep love emotion and at every reminder of Ellie we are reaching for those pop-ups. We just don't like to see good people sad, even if they are cartoon characters. Later on in the story we meet Charles Muntz (Plummer) an Explorer type who is on the search for a bird no one believes exists. And, we have talking dogs. When Muntz mentions out loud that meeting Mr. Fredrickson (Carl) is a real treat the dogs go wild. This was a funny scene with Muntz saying he has to be careful about using that word. I'd say it was the funniest scene in the movie. The dogs do provide some humor at times. The voice of the dog, Alpha, was also supposed to provide some humor, but at times Alpha sounded like one of the Chipmunks and at other times, when Muntz adjusts the electronics in the collar, he sounded likeÂ…Â….well, I really don't know. With either voice he was very difficult to understand. So much for humor there. Oh, when Carl lifts the house UP into the air Russell (Nagai), a Cub Scout, looking to win a merit badge for helping elderly people, comes along too. I suppose he was supposed to be comic relief, (Carl is depicted as a grumpy old man), but the dogs win this hands down. Russell is used to move the story to places Carl doesn't want to go at times. Russell hopes his father, who he rarely sees, will finally make one of the Scout presentations. The father never shows. Where's that box? See?Why would I watch an animated cartoon again? Wall-e was a disaster, so why? I had to see what others saw in here that prompted it to be nominated for Best Picture. I now know these people are useless and crazy, and I will never watch another animated cartoon movie even if, by law, it is the one movie I must watch before I die. I'll go along with Animated Feature category, but not Best Picture. Best Picture? No, let's leave Best Picture to the humans, not animations. Give me a break. Violence: Yes.

Limitless," Quite Entertaining
","Eddie Morra (Cooper) is given a new pill, NZT48, that will increase his brain power to 100% and he excels in everything. What a guy! However, there are those who want his NZT supply and he needs to outsmart them. Can he do it? Should be a no-brainerÂ…Â…Â…Â…I am writing this review using only 10% of my brain, so WYSIWYWG. Get it? HA !It is not easy using this 10% (I hope it's at least that) and writing about someone who can use 100 % of his brain power. I am sure I will miss or not understand many things that areÂ….umÂ….way over my head. I can only hope that those who read this review are also at the 10% level and won't think too badly of me as I plod along. However, I do fear those readers may be above 10%. Bummer. Woe is me. This was quite entertaining. Not exactly like a comedy as one would imagine with the plot line being what it is. No, this is high drama, but does have some funny moments.I kept asking myself who is Bradley Cooper and someone said he was in THE HANGOVER. Ah, yes, that almost comedic comedy. I saw that and didn't see anything funny in there except for the Taser scenes. But, Cooper proves my point in that so-called comedians do better with drama because they have the timing for drama, not comedy. Cooper did exceptionally well in this movie. (Bob, you do know they are making THE HANGOVER 2, don't you?) I have low expectations about that, but will give it a shot. Also, Robert DeNiro (as Carl Van Loon) was excellent. I just hope his not-so-funny comedy days are over with. For me they weren't working for him. But in drama, he has few peers. And, if truth be told, he is extremely funny in dramas when he is has some funny lines to deliver in that serious way he has that produces laughter. He was great in here and I wouldn't rule out a Best Supporting Actor award. But, that's just me. Abbey Cornish (as Morra's girlfriend). Wow! Where did she come from? Absolutely beautiful and sexy. Will have to keep an eye out for her in the future. She could be the next Charlize Theron. HmmmmÂ…Â…Â…Â…..The story isn't as predictable as one might think. It has a few twists and turns and not all of them pretty. The way they did the flashbacks in the beginning was exceptional. Very good. The acting by all, the pacing, real stunts and the CGI were all right on the mark. Very entertaining. Well, that's my 10%. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,0,0,1 August 2011
Jack Reacher," Good Thriller with a Good Mystery
","James Barr (Joseph Sikora), a former military sniper, is in jail for killing 5-people and says he is innocent. He asks for ex-Army MP Officer, Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise). But Reacher knew Barr in Iraq and is out to prove him guilty. HmmmÂ…Â…should be a slam dunk.It's not often that we get a good thriller along with a good mystery as well, but that is what we have here. Why would Barr ask for Jack Reacher if Reacher knew what Barr did in Iraq? Also, what was the purpose of Barr killing 5-people who had no connection to each other? Assistant DA Helen (Rosamund Pike) asks Reacher to help prevent Barr from getting the death penalty. But, we also had some good fight scenes and an exciting car chase. Let the games begin. This gets somewhat talky in the beginning as Helen and Reacher analyze what had happened. But, we hang on every word because we, too, need to know things. All this sounded like the dialogue was dubbed in, but I think the microphones were just too close to the characters and this made it seem as if the dialogue was dubbed in. To be honest it did look like Rosamund Pike had weak knees around Tom Cruise, but the script wouldn't go here. It just looked that way to me. The supporting cast of bad guys was good as was Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo), assigned to the Barr case. Robert Duvall comes in as a retired USMC Gunnery Sgt, Gunny Cash, who does a masterful job as the owner of a gun range and inserts some humor as he deals with Reacher. Over all this was very good. But, I did have the feeling something was missing. Maybe it needed a better ending as this one was kind of weak for such a good story. Maybe Tom Cruise is leaving his Mission Impossible movies behind and is now centering on another action hero: Jack Reacher, who is described as someone who seems to only wear the clothes on his back, doesn't care about the law and is only concerned with one thing: justice, and the way he goes about achieving it may shock you. Hey, Lee Child, the author of the Jack Reacher series wrote about 15-books. See? (8/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, not much",8,56,85,9 May 2013
Thor," A lot of fun
","Thor (Hemsworth) caused a problem in Asgard and is sent to earth by Odin (Hopkins), his father, as punishment in the hope he learns to be a responsible and worthy warrior and eventually king. Odin then throws Thor's Hammer and it lands on earth. This is quite entertaining. As a kid, I read a lot of superhero comics but do not recall Thor, but no matter, the movie catches me up. The CGI is very impressive and will blow you away with designs of the Asgard city and inner workings. Simply outstanding. Kudos.When Thor is banished to earth, the people there have no clue as to who he is and the interplay among them is pure gold. These are the moments that end up making the movie memorable and good. I wished those moments would have lasted longer. Natalie Portman does a excellent job and the chemistry with Hemsworth is also excellent. Again, if those moments, just mentioned, lasted longer, we would have seen more of Jane (Portman) and enjoyed more of her interplay with Thor. These are the moments that have us talking about the movie long afterwards. This is part of the human condition we savor. The entire cast performed well, but kudos to the person who hired Hemsworth in the first place. If I didn't know better, I would say he actually is Thor playing a human playing Thor. See? That's how good he is in here. I can only hope there are Thor sequels in our future. Can't wait. When Thor is going to retrieve his Hammer - which no one can move - and which is surrounded by suspicious government types, he encounters many guards. Another guard with bow and arrow says to his boss something like, 'Do you want me to take the shot or do you want to send in more men for him to toss around?' How good is that dialogue? Huh? Pure gold. Idris Elba, gave an outstanding performance as the Gate Keeper Heimdall. We were mesmerized by him and would like to know if he is available should we decide to live in a gated community. Great job. All in all a lot of fun and, I can only hope there are Thor sequels in our future. Can't wait. Is there an echo in here?Violence: Yes.

The Happening," Does Not Happen
","An invisible force is causing a breakdown of human behavior in the NE United States. People become disoriented and die. What is going on?Remember the old expression, 'there's something in the wind'? Well, someone who is not too creative decided to make a movie out of it. As a short story it would have been fine, read and forgotten, but now we have to contend with a truly boring movie with a Class A star (Wahlberg) to boot. Mark, what were you thinking? Go back to police dramas.Ah, but there is an explanation and it is simply that a force of nature is causing all this and no one can figure out why. Normally, I wouldn't give the answer away, but no one should have to sit through this Snoozer with halting dialogue and absolutely no suspense. Ah, suspense could have made this worthwhile. Can't believe I just said that.It's just not that the main story is unclear, it is also that the characters don't seem to know their lines and they seem not to even know their relationship with each other and we, in the audience, don't know either. Can't even come close.Already, I have taken up too much of your time with this NON-HAPPENING event. Yes, there is something in the wind: a bad movie.Violence: Yes.

Zombieland," It's a trip. Funny
","Tallahassee (Harelson) and Columbus (Eisenberg) team up with Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin) to fight and kill Zombies that have taken over parts of the United States. Tallahassee is also on a quest to find a Twinkie. Yes, a Twinkie. Go figure. To think I had to watch Zombieland to find a movie with real laugh-out-loud (at times) comedy in it. Zombieland has many, many good lines and physical comedy within. To put it bluntly, it's a trip. Normally, I would have stayed away from anything to do with Zombies (hey, I have to sleep at night), but a promo I saw gave me a different perspective, and, of course, the promo was a funny one. So I took a chance. If the movie explained how the Zombies were all over the place, I missed it. Didn't matter, it was what it was. Yes, there is some gore in the beginning, but the scenes didn't last long and later on the gore had subsided. But, cover children's' eyes when you fear a close-up of a Zombie is coming toward you. Later on the Zombies didn't seem to have the same scary effect. They become kind of funny. Really. Harrelson gave a comfortable, comedic, spot-on performance. He is extremely talented. The rest of the cast performed well and no one over-acted or acted stupid, or silly like you usually see in what they call 'comedies' these days. A good job by all. Well done. Not sure why Bill Murray was in the movie. In fact, those scenes at his residence could have been anyone's place. He was okay, just not sure why he was in there. He was not a Zombie, but was outfitted like one. His reasoning for the get-up did make a lot of sense. But what was really bad, was what happened to him. Didn't make sense. Judge Judy doesn't like things that don't make sense. But, there it was Judge. Go figure. To sum up our history. We have gone after Indians, the British, the Mexicans, each other in the North and the South, Vampires, and now Zombies. What is next? Is there anything left? Whatever it will be, let's hope that there is a serious sense of humor about it all. This was surprisingly good. And, they left it open for a Zombieland 2. Can't wait. This one was a trip.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Still Tedious, Goofy and way too long
","Once again the good Ts and the bad Ts go to war and the bad Ts try to destroy the earth and the good Ts fight to save it and destroy the bad Ts. I think I have that right. They have names, but Speed Talk isn't my strength and I didn't catch the names. It must be pointed out here that no pyramids were harmed in any way. What you see is CGI so no worries, eh?Let's see, there is speed reading, speed dialing, speed dating, and now we have Speed Talking. The characters talked so fast I had no idea what they were saying or they spoke in such husky whispering voices that nothing came across with that as well. I was left with just watching CGI most of the time. And, since Michael Bay doesn't know when to stop these action scenes I drifted off to La La land several times. When I awoke, I realized I had not missed a thing, well, except for the story, of course. Some say there was one. Indeed?If Michael Bay spent as much time with the story, dialogue and the acting performances, as he does with the CGI, he might have an Oscar on his hands. But, sadly the acting was wanting (except for Josh Duhamel, and Rainn Wilson. Both are pros and did good),and the story was lost in all the explosions/transformings, and I couldn't care about anything except when this was over. Two and one half hours of T2 is like 14-hrs of T2. Yes, it is still tedious, goofy and way too long as T1 was. Way too long. Did I mention that is was way too long? Oh.As for the CGI, it was terrific and is the best I have ever seen. But, when it goes on for too long, it becomes old hat, boring, been there done that, and then it becomes quite annoying too. I am sure an Oscar has Michael Bay's name on it for Best Director or Special Effects. And, to be honest, it is deserved. Say what I will about T2, the directing of the CGI was pretty good. The CGI is terrific. There was just too much of it. Did I mention that T2 was way too long? Oh.Now, I will go to bed every night and pray there is no Transformers 3.Violence: Yes.

Jersey Boys," Well told, and performed with Great Music
","In the mid-1950s a young singing group escapes from a life of petty crime with their first big hit: Sherry. We see the beginning of an iconic singing group to their breakup when Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young) sets out on his own with Bob Gaudio (Eric Bergen) doing the song writing. The group settles on the name of The Four Seasons (taken from a motel sign) and is much better than what they were using: The Four Lovers. See?The Four Seasons: John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli, Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito, Michael Lomenda as Nick DeVito and Eric Bergen as Bob Gaudio. Other hits: Walk Like a Man, Big Girls Don't Cry, Can't Take My Eyes off of You.The music is terrific as was the acting all around. John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli got better singing as the movie progressed. In the beginning I had my doubts mostly because Frankie Valli's voice is hard to imitate. Not convinced? Listen to the real Frankie Valli when the credits run and you will see. However, when in the group setting on stage Young does a credible job . Clint Eastwood does a masterful job of telling this story. He uses, at times, a technique whereby an actor turns to the audience to give us additional insight that doesn't have to be explained otherwise. Reminded me of a Walter Cronkite TV show YOU ARE THERE back in the day that used the same technique. (showing your age, are we?). In one scene we see a TV show with a young Clint Eastwood in Rawhide. Alfred Hitchcock used to put himself into his movies sometimes as an extra. We used to keep an eye to see who saw him first. Bob Gaudio is credited with writing all the songs sung by The Four Seasons; and later for Valli when he went out on his own. Bob Crew (Mike Doyle) also had a hand in song-writing at times. No matter what the movie is about if Christopher Walken is in it I am there. I simply cannot get enough of his acting as I couldn't for Patrick McGoohan, and Jack Palance. Anyway he was very good as Gyp DeCarlo, a local mob boss. The pacing is good and the movie never drags. Yes, there are many clichÃ©s in here but keep in mind the times and those clichÃ©s were in vogue. See?I would like to have seen real photos of the Four Seasons performing when the credits ran, but that didn't happen. What did happen was a dance by all the cast on some Jersey street as one of Frankie Valli's songs played. Very good. Kudos for the entire movie. (9/10)Violence: Not really.

Crazy Heart," Good Music. Okay Story
","Bad Blake (Bridges) is a country western singer who has fallen on hard times. He is out of shape, smokes endlessly, drinks too much and is not going anywhere. He is an alcoholic. His fans love the ground he walks on. He finds Jane (Gyllenhaal) and believes he has found love, but Jane discovers there are some things you don't trust an alcoholic with.I kept waiting for the song Crazy Heart to play, but Crazy Heart is not a song. Silly me. It is the title of this movie. The theme song of this movie is The Weary Kind and as songs go, it was okay, I guess. But it had no life to it and wasn't meant to, I suppose. The song had no hook. I like songs with hooks. This was kind of like a ballad, without it sounding too much like a ballad, weary maybe. No hooks. That killed it for me. However, the other country songs in here were spot on. In fact, they were better than the songs I heard at the recent County Music Awards show on TV. Yes, they still have that. They still call them country songs, but someone needs to re-examine and re-classify them. They were not the country music songs I am used to hearing. But, the country songs in this movie were. And, in one instance a little Cajun music was thrown in. I was in heaven. Jeff Bridges was in his element. Yes, the beard kept reminding me of Kris Kristofferson, but I got over it. Almost. Bridges sang his own songs and did a very good job. I have said for years that he was the most under-rated actor in Hollywood. Colin Farrell was good as Tommy Sweet (Blake's one time protÃ©gÃ©) and he can sing too. Who knew? A bigger part should have been made for him. Maggie Gyllenhall was perfect as Blake's love interest. As for Robert Duvall, well, what can I say? He is always perfect (and to me he will forever be Gus from Lonesome Dove).The story was okay. I kept hoping the writers would hurry up and get Blake into Detox or some program as I was getting tired of watching him vomit. If the title song or the theme song would have been more of a toe-tapper and had the hooks, this would have been a bigger movie and may have won Best Picture. I am sure of it. But, as Bad says his songs came from 'life, unfortunately.' And, not all songs are toe-tappers, but, many of his songs in here were.Violence: No. Sex: Almost. Nudity: No. Sexual situations: Yes.

12 Years a Slave," Well Told. Gripping.
","This is based upon a true story. In 1841, freeman Solomon Northrup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), married with children, in New York is kidnapped and sold into Slavery in Louisiana. He is given the name of Platt.Watching this you may ask yourself: how can people treat people this way? There is a lot of cruelty in here and I think the point is to show us that Slavery was indeed cruel and brutal. White Slave-owners took the claim of Slaves as their property way too seriously. True, there were good Slave-owners and we see one with Benedict Cumberbatch as Ford, but that time didn't last long and even Ford was wary of his Overseers and sells his debt (Platt) to a very cruel Slave-owner: Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender).We see a lot of beatings and we cringe a lot. Yes, this is only a movie, but consider back in those days that things were probably much worse than what we see on the big screen. So think 'much worse' when you watch. If you think the beatings were overdone, think again. The acting all around is good. I thought the best performances in here were by Benedict Cumberbatch as Ford and by Michael Fassbender as Edwin Epps. Fassbender was nominated for Best Supporting Actor and should have gotten it. Ejiofor was nominated for Best Actor and he was okay, but Matthew McConaughey was the buzz saw in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB and it was no contest within this category. Lupita Nyong'o as Patsey won the award for Best Supporting Actress.The picture itself won for Best Picture. Did I think it should have won Best Picture? Glad you asked. No it shouldn't have. I thought CAPTAIN PHILLIPS was the better movie. Seems that true, almost true or based upon actual events stories get the nod for an Oscar Nomination. My other choices would have been DALLAS BUYERS CLUB or THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, both based upon true stories. Maybe there should be a True Story category as they seem to have the edge. HmmmÂ…Â…Â…Sometimes the dialogues reminded me of the TV show DEADWOOD when we heard an almost poetic and most annoying cadence by all the characters all the time. At times in here, the dialogues were too convoluted (read cadenced) especially when a character went on explaining something as when Brad Pitt as Bass talked about coming changes in society. I am saying sometimes the dialogues did not ring true to me. People didn't talk like that. There were other times - and too often - these annoying cadence-laced dialogues were spewed out by other characters.The Ending (thought you would never get to it) was okay. I mean what else could be expected? He was gone for 12-years and believed dead, and his family had moved on. So no brass band celebration. I thought this Ending was the right touch.

There Will Be Blood," Ah!
","While prospecting for silver Daniel Plainview (Day-Lewis), finds oil and starts to build his empire.I am not familiar with Daniel Day-Lewis so I must ask, does he always sound like he is imitating Sean Connery's speech? Well, anyway, it worked; I enjoyed that part of him. He does capture the Best Actor Award and I have no problem with that. His character is driven to succeed to the point he trusts no one. Problem is we don't know why he is that way, no background was given to provide any clue. He claims his wife died in childbirth, and later says he found the baby and kept it to show to others he has a softer side and maybe they would feel sorry for him and give in to him. That worked too. But, the more successful he becomes, the meaner he becomes. Again, we do not know why this progression. We just accept it and Daniel Day-Lewis walks off with the Oscar. Ah! So the key to the Award is not explaining oneself? Ah! The movie holds you because you do not know what mean thing Plainview will throw at others, and this continues all the way to the very end. Very Clever. It's not that we do not like Plainview, we just don't understand him at all and we look for a softer side, and end up in a dry well. Sorry. For a movie to behave like an epic-in-the-making, there are no women in here to help us discover who this man is. No humor. And, absolutely no give and many lines by this man are like they come from a shotgun. Ooops, he does show a softer side when he talks about what he will do for the community so he can rake in the oil profits. He needs to do that to get what he wants, and that, of course, is: everything. Yes, he is a good salesman (person) when he needs to be. Ah!Since this movie seemed to be nominated for just about everything, I was surprised there was no nomination for the Music Oscar. The music was outstanding, and yet, no nomination for that. Maybe, it's just me. Let's see: struggle to find silver, find oil instead, trust no one, get baby, use baby, build empire, trust no one, get religion to get more oil, steal oil (oh, oh!) to make bigger empire, trust no one, blood spilled.

I was caught off guard for a minute. Burlesque in California, why not the east coast where Burlesque ruled for a time? And, if I heard correctly, the performers lip-synced the songs for the customers because this was really a strip club, but no one stripped. I kept watch for that. Nada., nothing, zeroÂ…Â…Â…Â… Burlesque, as I had heard, had comedians as well as song and dance girls. Not in here. But, the music was of such a toe-tapping nature, we didn't miss the comedians. All was good. I have new respect for Christina Aquilera. The girl can sing. Maybe a few acting lessons are in her future, but she held her own. And, Cher sang the opening song and I kept hoping for more of her singing. She did sing one more song later on and WHAT A TALENT !! Can't say enough about her singing. And, her acting is right up there too. What really made this good with excellent pace was the story interspersed among song and dance acts. Very lively, very real, and very good.

Later he is hooked up with Rita (Emily Blunt) and together they must find a way to kill the Alpha Mother to end the war. One thing about a Tom Cruise movie: he and the movie he is in never disappoint.

You needed everything in the first paragraph above just in case you miss some things as the scenes move along pretty fast. You're welcome. Yes, there is a fallacy in here which is to say other soldiers may also kill an Alpha Alien and then have a Ground Hog Day scenario, but here, we are only dealing with Major Cage and his Ground Hog Day escapades.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Enjoyable
","This is based upon actual events as told by Jordan Belfort in his books on his life. Many names have been changed in here. Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio) builds his empire with penny-stocks defrauding stockholders and raking in millions. The movie is 3-hours long and it went pretty fast because the pacing, dialogues by all and the narratives by DiCapiro as Belfort were very good. When a movie is based upon real life over-the-top partying and drug addicts we should be aware that what we see and hear may offend. We see Belfort with a partying life style and hooked on drugs. The partying or more correct term 'sex-orgies' show up many times. Nudity abounds as do simulated sex scenes and lets' not forget sex talk throughout and the accompanying language. Still we understand that most of what we see and hear did actually take place according to Jordan Belfort's books on these parts of his life. Mr. Scorsese, the director, opted to show all and tell all.Did we need to see the clients who were defrauded? No. If this was brought in the movie may have been 1-hour longer. Just hearing about those defrauded was enough. We didn't need to see and hear any sad stories. Leonardo DiCaprio was nominated for Best Actor and he could have gotten it, but he ran into a buzz-saw by the name of Matthew McConaughey in the DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. McConaughey had a small part in here and was extremely good. Actually, Leonardo DiCaprio should have gotten the Best Actor Award for many of his previous movies. As I have said before and will say again: he is a class act and he makes everyone else better. We do hear some good lines with humor, but we also see some silly and stupid sight-gags and keeping in mind these may have actually happened, we cannot fault Hollywood this time. Many of these instances involve Jonah Hill as Belfort's partner Donnie. I found these scenes to be extremely annoying. Jonah Hill, I believe, still thinks he is a comedian. Not a chance. When he slows down and performs in a good dramatic fashion, he is very good. Take from this what you will, but I did find it to be enjoyable.

","This is based on a true story. Detective Richie Roberts (Crowe) heads up a special task force to eliminate the drug trade in New York City and has his eyes on Frank Lucas (Washington) who runs a drug operation there.The thing about a movie being based on a true story is one really never knows if everything is true therein. But, I am looking for entertainment and I was entertained and what was true or not true doesn't matter to me. Well, okay, it does matter to me when it involves our political or military history. Gangsters? No. However, that being said , there are some things that needed work.First of all there was no cat and mouse between Roberts and Lucas. They meet practically in the last 15-minutes of the movie. And, still there was no real tension between them. There should be some tension somewhere in this type of movie. Somewhere if not between those two.When the movie began, I kept asking myself: when is this going to start? There was too much gangster foreplay going on. That gangster build-up wasn't necessary. I get it. There are bad guys out there and the longer this went on I kind of liked Frank Lucas. Not good.The same on the other side with Roberts, a cop studying for the Bar in New York, coping with a custody battle with his ex, being hated by the NY Police force for honestly bringing in almost a million dollars in unmarked bills and not taking any (The movie says there are bad cops out there and there are many of them.), and then being assigned to a special task force (this to keep him away from cops, who wouldn't help him in the future.) I liked him too.Still, I enjoyed this movie. The pace was fine, it was the cat and mouse part of the story or any tension anywhere that was missing.But, to be fair, the session in the interview room between Roberts and Lucas was pure gold and was worth the price of admission.Violence:Yes; Sex:Yes; Nudity: Yes; Language: Yes, in the beginning, but then they forgot about it.",6,1,2,11 March 2008
The Wrestler," Good, but tough to watch
","Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Rourke) is a burnt out top pro-wrestler, has a heart attack, but still wants to compete one last time.I guess Thomas Wolfe may not have been entirely correct. You can go home again if you are either a top pro wrestler or a Class A actor who hasn't acted in years. This story is about both the wrestler and the actor (in my mind only) and the road has not been easy for either one. This is tough to watch because we are probably privy to the way pro wrestling really works and it is brutal. I had to avert my eyes with some scenes. Yes, I know about movie magic, but hey, it was rough. I figured I either had to be in shape to watch this or be somewhat crazy. Say what you will about pro wrestling, but these guys are in shape. No doubt about that. And, some of the things they do won't be shown on television -- not that I watch. The problem for me was that I couldn't separate the wrestler from the actor. I want both to succeed. It was personal for Mr. Rourke and that wasn't all acting the way I saw it. And, that being the case I would not have nominated him for Best Actor. When it's personal, it's real. The story was good. There is a good mix of The Ram taking part time jobs to help with the bills, and trying to get back with the daughter he abandoned years ago; and he takes up with Stripper Pam (Tormei).The production is good, and the pace is excellent. It's a good story. Were The Wrestler and the Actor able to go home again? Ah, you think you know the answer about the Wrestler, because you may have seen the movie. We'll have to see what Mr. Rourke comes up with next to see if he made it home. Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, quite clear too. Nudity: Yes, quite clear too.

Dark Shadows," Disappointing, not entertaining at all
","Vampire Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) awakens from his 200-year sleep and discovers his family is not right and resolves to make the family prosperous again. Not all know he is a vampire. I had no prior knowledge of the Dark Shadows TV show. I didn't know what to expect. All I knew was that Johnny Depp is a good actor and I took a chance hoping that it wasn't scary because, as you know, I need to sleep at night.What it wasn't: Not scary, not funny, and not entertaining. And after all that I had to ask myself: why was this made in the first place? Nothing made sense. A story should have a beginning, a middle and an ending. This had a middle and stayed there as we had nothing to look forward to because the middle never moved anywhere. And, there was no caring for any of the characters because we didn't really get a chance to get to know them. See?I stayed with it for one reason. I did like Johnny Depp's performance with that cadence. If the script was any better this might have had a chance at being entertaining. Didn't happen.One bright spot was a Karen Carpenter song that they let play almost all the way through. Very good, but that was the only bright spot. Alice Cooper was brought in and, of course, looked every bit Goth as I guess that was a theme someone forgot to capitalize on. I was looking for something as good as The ADDAMS FAMILY, and maybe even THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW. Didn't happen. (1/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Not really. They tried but with clothes on.

Hancock," Okay, but hey, it's complicated
","Hancock is a superhero who leaves a lot of destruction in his wake as he saves people or helps put people in jail. PR man Ray (Bateman) believes he can change Hancock so the public will like and accept him.We like our superheroes: Superman, Captain Marvel, Capt America, Spiderman etc. They are good people and we would like to have their powers to be used for good and so we fantasize or we used to (read 'and we still do'). But, when one comes along who doesn't fit the mold, then we cringe, and hope by some miracle (miracles now?) that the superhero will become good like we would be if we had the powers he has (still fantasizing, are we?). With all the above out of the way, the CGI again wins this one. There really didn't need to be all that destruction, but the CGI elves (hey, it's Christmas time) didn't see it that way. And, for some reason, directors think the pubic feels the same way. Not so when the CGI runs too long. They didn't run long here, they just ran too often. Now, if anyone can recall the explanation by Mary (Theron) as to who Hancock is, where he came from and why he is here along with her (hey, she's like him) you really paid attention to her words. I just paid attention to her. But, I did to up to a point where she said she was his sister. HA! You believe that? Well, don't. He is her husband (hey, I guessed it first). Yes, yes, and she is already married to RayÂ…Â…it's complicated. The acting was fine, no Oscars though. The CGI was terrific. The story? Well, there could have been more of it, more substance. As it is now, it's too superficial, an outline. Can we expect Hancock II? HmmmmÂ…Â…Â….Hope not. Yes, the movie is entertainingÂ…Â…somewhat. I wished it would have gone in different directions, but she's married to Ray and to HancockÂ…Â…Hey, it's complicated. Does the movie save itself? Yes, kinda.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Yes, one F-bomb uttered by Hancock. The A-H word was uttered a lot.",5,0,2,1 December 2008
Shooter," Worthy Action Movie
","Retired Marine Corps Sniper Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg) believes he was set up to take the fall for an assassination attempt and decides to fight back the only way he was trained to.I guess Bruce Willis was tied up with another Die Hard movie, but no matter Mark Wahlberg does a more than acceptable job here. This moves along at a very good pace, nothing is overdone and the stunts are very good. All performances are more than good although I would like to have seen more of Rhona Mitra Â– and they wouldn't let her use her English accent and she did come across as a little lost because of that, in my opinion. Well, she had to think Americaneze each time and she struggled with it. You could see it. Actually, Rhona and Kate could have switched roles and the accent could have stayed.(OK, Bob what else didn't you like) Well, in the beginning, most of the cast had to speak in low tones and I (and, the audience too, I am sure) had trouble listening in low tones mode.(Anything else?) Yes, they show Nick (Pena) looking at a computer screen several times and the camera held position so I can read it, but the fonts were so small I couldn't read anything. They know this stuff will go to DVD. Help us out, will ya? (You done?) No, and here you will have had to have seen the movie. My question is why did Sarah (Mara) revert back to her maiden name after her sniper husband was killed in action 3-years earlier? She loved and admired him and had his picture all over her house. Why the change? Just so the bad guys tracking Swagger had a harder time of finding him if he went to her house? She couldn't know anything like that, so why the change? Didn't make sense to me.(You done now?) Almost. All thru the movie I admired the dialogue that didn't include F-bombs all over the place and I was taking my hat off to themÂ…..(Yeah, butÂ…Â…..)Â…. until the last 10-minutes when all F-bomb hell broke loose.OK, I sounded pretty picky above, but all in all this is really a Worthy Action Movie, and I am sure Bruce Willis would have given us a few memorable lines as he is prone to do, but Mark Wahlberg is an okay Action Hero and it is about time he struck out on his own. (and, he did a very good job in another movie: Invincible, didn't he?)

Inception," Very Good, but too long
","Cobb (DiCaprio) is an Extractor, who steals industrial secrets by getting into a person's dreams and getting what he needs. But, Mr. Saito (Watanabe) hires Cobb and wants him to implant (called inception) a notion in Fischer's (Murphy) dream to have him break up his late father's company or the whole world will be held hostage to the monopoly. Watching Inception is like looking at a Picasso painting. You are not sure what you are seeing. You see some things you like, some you don't, and much (if not all) you don't understand. But, you keep looking to see if it makes sense to you. I'll leave it there. There is a lot of gobbley-gook explanations psychiatrists would salivate at. There are dreams, dreams within dreams, and dreams within deeper levels of dreams within dreams. See? Once you get by the gobbley-gook explanations you sit and watch the movie like you watched an old Mission Impossible TV show back in the day. You are mesmerized. You watch wires being strung, explosive charges placed, monitors placed, needles injected, lies and other rationalizations being told. See, just like an old Mission Impossible TV show, except there are also tons of gunfire and car chases which MI didn't have much of. But, the CGI and other special effects are simply fantastic and yes, these things are perhaps things you might see in dreams because â€“ as you well know- many things are possible in dreams where the illogical become logical. Hey, this is a dream. Anything is possible. Things that don't make sense in the real world become real within a dream and they make sense. Perfectly logical. See?The actors become intense and so do you and you are fully engaged now once the dreams within dreams start. All is good except for one thing: the movie is too long and you are looking for the end game. If they had cut 40-minutes out, this would have been more enjoyable. But, too much shooting etc takes its toll, and, this hurts any Best Picture Oscar nomination in my view. There is no denying that Leonardo DiCaprio raises the performances of everyone around him and this is blatantly obvious and that's a good thing. One day Hollywood will see that he and Matt Damon (not in this movie) are Oscar worthy actors. One day. After seeing this, I know 3-things: (1) If you saw this in a movie theater, you may be encouraged to take out the DVD and watch it again fast-forwarding thru the too many shootings, car chases and explosions. And, (2) When you next see a Picasso painting you may be reminded of this movie. And, (3) You are going to try to control what you do in your dreams. Good luck with that. Violence: Yes.

Sherlock Holmes," Kind of Tedious
","Sherlock Holmes (Downey) and Doc Watson (Law) have to figure out how bad guy Blackwood (Strong) who was just hanged and buried, was recently seen wandering around the cemetery, and what is he up to?What have they done to Sherlock Holmes? They try to make him into an Action Hero. Who's next? Archie, that Drew Girl, Tom or Huck, Anne of whatever, Charlie Chan (not to be confused with Jackie Chan)?Because of the promos, I knew I would have reservations about this film. I didn't want to see Sherlock Holmes as an Action Hero. I liked him the old way, serious, calculating, proper, genius level, well-dressed at all times with proper manners. Here they have him most of those things but looking and acting like a slob most of the movie. And, they had him a fighting member of some Fight Club for lack of a better explanation. Not my idea of Sherlock Holmes. Not anyone's idea. Sir Arthur is revving up for a twirl. What was good? The cinematography was outstanding. The acting was good all around. The stunts were okay as were the CGI. It was kind of good to see Watson not be the passive sidekick we saw from the TV shows and Sherlock Holmes movies of the past. The dialogues were good, but the clarity of them by Downey suffered. Since S. Holmes was English, and Downey is not, they had Downey talk light speed so you wouldn't notice he didn't have an English accent. Guess his English accent wasn't good enough and they decided to go with fast-talk-muttering. Many, many times I muttered to no one in particular, 'Whadee say?' See? Jude Law, on the other hand, was clear as he is English. What was bad? Most of the movie was shot in the dark. Too many fight scenes. Understanding Downey was difficult. And, worst of all, the movie was tooooo long Â…Â….and tedious. I couldn't wait for it to be over. I didn't care for or have any sympathy for any of the characters. As for humor, there was very little of it. Sir Arthur is gaining speed toward full twirl.When Mary (Reilly) and Irene (McAdams) were on the scene, they were a breath of fresh air to this too darkly lighted movie. Not really of any consequence, but: Holmes never wore the hat with the bill in front and in the back; Holmes never smoked the curvy pipe we were used to seeing â€“ here it was a straight barrel.As Archenemy Professor Moriarty was mentioned at the end of this, a sequel seems to be in the works. Oh, no ! I can't take another one. I believe Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is now in full twirl.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",5,1,3,31 March 2010
WALLÂ·E," Sor-e
","An almost intelligent robot (WALL-E) goes about his business of cleaning the earth up after an apparently devastating war. Humans are far, far away on a luxury space ship until the earth is ready to receive them again. In the meantime WALL-E encounters a female probe, EVE and is smitten. OK, let's get this out of the way: WALL-E is Waste Allocation Load Lifter Â– Earth Class. The last full length cartoon I watched was The Jungle Book and it had class, good lines and a good story. I suppose there are other good ones out there since The Jungle Book, but Â….. This animation cartoon had possibilities to say many things, but failed to do so, and it wasn't funny. Clever, yes, but not hilarious as some have postulated. The humans on the luxury ship were not eager to get back to earth, only the Captain was the eager one. They were happy doing what they were doing because for hundreds of years in space they knew nothing else. And, if you saw the over portly humans there would be the tendency to blame them for their physical condition, but the rigors of space did all that to them. So we are not surprised to see there were none of the reasons expounded upon to never let this happen to earth again, no more war etc etc. For hundreds of years in space they knew nothing about war and seemed to have forgotten all about living on earth. They knew nothing else. But, the Captain had an inkling. WALL-E's flight to stay with EVE as she reported back to the mother ship showed us the human condition on the luxury ship. And, that is how it all happened, boys and girls.What would have made this more interesting was to have WALL-E actually speak besides his repeating his name over and over and over and over again. He had artificial intelligence. His speaking would have gone a long way to making this a more fun movie. What made the robot in Short Circuit (great movie) so endearing was his ability to speak, exclaim, wonder, ask questions, be surprised etc. Yes, that was not WALL-E's purpose but it could have been built in by the humans so to speak, and I would have given this a better review than a mere C. I would have laughed, cried until it became a part of me. Didn't happen.Yes, the kids will like it but would have liked it better if WALL-E actually spoke. Listen to the kids if there is a sequel.Visually, this is excellent and deserves an A. Some want to put this up for an Oscar: Best Picture. Give me a break. A 'C' doesn't beget an Oscar. Give it the Oscar for Visual Effects. Are we done now?Violence: Yes, in a cartoon kind of way. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, although the humans almost went there",5,10,21,17 January 2009
The Blind Side," Wonderful Story
","This is based upon a true story.Leigh Anne Tuohy (Bullock) and husband Sean (McGraw) take in Big Mike Oher (Aaron) and help develop his potential. Since I knew I was going to watch the DVD and saw what the promos promised, I went and bought a box of Kleenex. Good move. What a wonderful story and true too. If more people were like the Tuohys, the world would be a better place. But, just think about it for a minute, the high risk they took taking in a kid from the streets. However, if Big Mike's real mother Denise (Lenox) didn't instill in him his good character, maybe we would never have heard of him and his place in sports and, of course, the Tuohys.Yes, some will say that much of the movie is sappy, maybe corny, but when you know this is a true story, and you like and believe the characters and the dialogue because you want to, then it's not sappy and corny. It's just right. See?The thing that impressed the most was the understatement of all on the screen. That had the most impact for me. And, in a true story the little things like the looks, subtle comments, and some good comedic lines go a long way to making this most enjoyable. Also, the support the entire family gave Big Mike. In the beginning, the Tuohy's son SJ (Head) was kind of annoying, but he grew on me and helped the comic relief along. Good job. I do have one complaint. In the High School games some of the camera angles could have been better showing how Big Mike protected the Quarterback's blind side. To be fair, there were a couple one-on-one scenes with Big Mike and the Defensive End where Big Mike pulverized that player. All in all a very good movie for all the family. And, it was nice to see Sandra Bullock deserve and win the Best Actress award. Most of us, by now, know that Big Mike wants to be called Michael and that he went to the Baltimore Ravens of the NFL where he is today. It almost makes me want to root for the Ravens, however my loyalty lies elsewhere, but I will keep an eye on Michael and wish him well. Hey, I invested in a box of Kleenex on his behalf. I now know I should have bought 2-boxes. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",9,1,1,28 April 2010
Music and Lyrics," Good Dialogue
","Sophie (Barrymore) helps Alex Fletcher (Grant) a one time singing star of the 1980s write a hit song for Cora (Bennett), the top Teen singing sensation.Yes, yes, yes, it's all predictable. What isn't? For a chick flick this is pretty good because they stay on message and don't screw it up with too much making out, crying and whining. Both Sophie and Fletcher have baggage, but it's dealt with in good fashion because the dialogue is quick, short and honest and get this: funny too. Why that's almost like a breath of fresh air when you really need it.I keep asking when Hugh Grant is going to make movies with more substance, but I realize that there is a market for this type of movie and he is very good at it. When he gets a little longer in the tooth maybe we'll see something else. As for Ms. Barrymore she is a very good actress and she can do movies like Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd but doesn't and I am not counting the Charlie's Angels movie.All is good in here, the acting, pace, and music too. The chemistry between Grant and Barrymore is good and believable, but it is really the witty, funny and honest dialogue that puts this over the top. Yes, a good script, but you need good people to put their mark on it and they did.Violence: No, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language:No",6,0,0,31 July 2007
Prometheus," Weak Script, Fantastic CGI
","In 2091 a team of scientists travel, on the good ship Prometheus, to a planet that may explain the origins of mankind.It appears no one ever watched Star Trek TV shows or the movies. Too many things went against logic especially in a distant, perhaps hostile, environment when the team arrived on that planet. Mr. Spock would not be amused. First of all the audio sound was very bad and it was difficult to hear clearly dialogues much of the time. The musicÂ….. Wait, there was music? I thought I knew what Guy Pearce looked like, but I still have no idea which character he was. Not addressing each other by name much of the time didn't help matters to let us get to know who was who. Yes, we did know who Charlize Theron (as Miss Vickers) was: the beautiful blonde.. We knew who Michael Fassbender (David the Android), was because that was clearly pointed out to us. It wasn't until the last half of the movie we knew who Noomi Rapace played. She was Elizabeth Shaw and her name was bandied about quite often in the last half of the movie. (Hey, she is not exactly well known to American audiences and without that dragon on her back it was hard to tell, ha ha). And, we did know that Idris Elba was Captain Janek. Okay, so much for character development or recognition or none of the above. But some things boggled my mind: You don't send out a probe on a unknown planet to investigate a hive or pyramid structure that appears man made? Hey, you have a gadget to map out the hive! You don't let it go and do its job? You don't test the air for air pollutants inside the hive even though your instruments tell you the air is breathable? You don't touch a black liquid ooze not knowing if it would liquefy your fingers even with gloves on. You don't bring back an alien head back to the ship without knowing what it is all about. You don't decide to animate the head with electricity and end up blowing it up? Why would you touch a snake-like form you have never seen in your life thinking you could make a pet of it with soft, soothing and endearing comments like you were getting to know a pretty kitten? You don't perform a C-Section on yourself to get the thing (not a baby) out of your stomach? Okay, maybe in 2091 that would have been possible. Many, many other things didn't make sense., but too numerous to list here. The scientists acted more like kids in a candy store than actual scientists, hence there appeared to be no order to investigating this planet and the hive structure. Like I said, Mr. Spock would not be amused. The billionaire who promoted and financed this venture wanted a cure for old age and thought the aliens on this planet would provide that. He was made up to really look like 'old age personified.' Really bad. Who was this person? Who played him? For a minute I thought it was Christopher Lambert, but noÂ…..it was someone else. He was the father of Ms Vickers (Charlize Theron), but there was no one else in the credits with Vickers as a last name. Bummer. Why did Blockbuster go out and buy 20 additional DV Ds for this one store? The only thing that comes to mind is that this movie is treated like a date night movie. Yes, there are many scary parts in the second half of this and your date may be inclined to cling to you for dear life. So what was good? The CGI, of course. Very , very good. Also, you can keep your SUVs, and foreign sports cars. I want the ship Prometheus. Very impressive. Great sets. I think fewer scientists would have made for a better, more controlled, more logical story. In many way, this was rushed as there was just too much to cover. Or maybe it just seemed that way. Pity.This started out really good and there was reason to believe we may have ' learned' some things about our origin even though they would have been made up. Hey, this is still a fictional story. But, at times, Star Trek gave us something to think about, but nothing in here did that except for one thing: The aliens who may have been us back in the day wanted nothing more than to destroy us. That seemed to be the overriding theme when all was said and done and that was never explained. Prometheus 2? HmmmmÂ…Â…Â…. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

Taken 2," As good as the original TAKEN
","Retired CIA agent, Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and Lenore ( Famke Janssen) his ex-wife and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) are on vacation in Istanbul when he and Lenore are kidnapped by the father of one of the men Bryan killed and who was one of the men who kidnapped Bryan's daughter Kim (in the first TAKEN movie). See? We are told that nothing succeeds like success and here we are shown a new twist on a previous movie. One asks, can Kim act like a Mel Gibson character and get her parents back? Only kidding. Well, I thought I was kidding, but Bryan has Kim doing things to pinpoint where the kidnappers are keeping him and Lenore. Kind of clever. Have no idea if all that would work in real life, but hey, this is a movie and anything is possible. Still clever though.The movie kind of starts out with Bryan giving Kim driving lessons to get her driver license (she failed twice before); but as you will see later Kim, with her unlicensed driving skills, destroys all the Turkish police cars chasing them. The car chasing stunts are truly spectacular and I had to dodge a few fenders myself and yes, some were pretty close. But, I am getting ahead of myself. Sorry. There is plenty of excitement throughout because we know that Bryan will do exactly what he says about himself: 'what I do best.' And, to be sure, he doesn't disappoint. The entire cast performed well, even the bad guys.Now, is this movie as good as the original TAKEN? I would say they are on a par with each other and that's pretty good.However, there is a picky point I must share. When Bryan is kidnapped we see him in a car going over a river on a ferry. When he escapes (come on, you know he will), we are not shown him going back over that river. In fact when Kim does what Bryan tells her what to do from her hotel location we see that he is close and no river is in sight. It was like he was just around the corner. See? Other than that, I see this as good thriller and very entertaining. Ah, I see you have a question: did Kim finally pass her driving test? HmmmmmÂ…Â…Â…Â… (7/10)Violence: Yes.

The Dark Knight Rises," Too dark, but quite an epic
","Batman (Christian Bale) comes out of self-imposed retirement to defeat terrorist Bane (Tom Hardy) who has taken over Gotham City.The CGI and other stunts were nothing short of fantastic and almost unbelievable. Kudos. The acting performances all around are good, although there are times the dialogues were difficult to hear clearly. The music was very good, yet haunting. I like this but it was too long. I liked this but was made to feel very uncomfortable when Bane takes over Gotham. I felt I was part of the Gotham citizenry living in total anarchy, and I couldn't see any way out. Bane imprisons most of the police force in the sewers of Gotham and closes the openings via explosions; he also creates, via explosions, deep holes in the football field and takes over Gotham in the guise of giving the people their freedoms. I liked this but Batman is in a deep prison cell after Bane defeats him and the only way out is to rock-climb a long circular wall to freedom. I liked this, but I don't like to see my superheroes become too human. I liked this but it was too dark.But mostly, I liked this knowing the Dark Knight would make things right. Isn't that why we go to the movies and stay to the end? In most cases staying to the end resolves many questions we have during the show, but here at THIS end, we still have questions.Is the Dark Knight dead and that ends the trilogy? Do we see the emergence of Robin to fight crime? Will Robin fight alone? Does everyone now know Bruce Wayne is or was Batman? At the end, does Alfred (Michael Caine) really see what we see him seeing or is it just wishful thinking? Is Batman really dead?Stay tuned to this Bat Channel to see what Christopher Nolen, the Director, comes up with nextÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â… (9/10)Violence: Yes.

Iron Man," Bad Dialogue. Good CGI
","Genius Industrialist Tony Stark (Downey) decides to give up his selfish playboy ways and help mankind after a life threatening experience. He dons a suit of iron to do this.Okay, now we have another Super Hero from the Comic Books. Let's see who is left: Plastic Man, Mandrake the Magician, Captain America or was that Captain Marvel, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Wonder Woman (the TV show doesn't count), Aquaman. Yes, I am going back in time as I do not know the names of the newer Super Heroes. Well, we have Superman, but not Superboy. HmmmÂ…Â….This movie was okay but there were many things not right with it. First of all the dialogue was truly bad in many places, and attempts at humor didn't quite make it. The dialogue in the scene with Pepper (Paltrow) and Stark where he asks her to remove a copper wire from the electro-magnetic device in his chest (you had to be there) was embarrassing to say the least. For the rest of the movie, it felt like much of the dialogue was dubbed in. Even Terrence Howard's dialogue was bad - he is good, the dialogue given to him is badly written. If the writers were using dialogue from the Comic Book, then they needed to upgrade the verbiage. In a Comic Book, it works, but in a movie not so much. Now, when we have a super hero we see him or her saving someone and the saved person is very happy and thankful to have been saved. Didn't happen here. The occupants of the car that Iron Man does save were truly, hysterically terrified. Hell, I was even cringing. This needed more of the saved people showing more appreciation for having been saved. A few lighter moments like that would have gone a long way to a better review.Robert Downey Jr is quite good and his facial expressions almost made up for some bad dialogue. I looked forward to those expressions. They are really good. But, truth be told his dialogue was better all the way thru. Just his. Just so you know. Jeff Bridges as Stark's partner was good, but again his dialogue needed help. He has a new look with beard, and bald head, but he is still one of the most under-rated actors around. Shaun Taub as Yinsen, the bad guy, was terrific. Paltrow was unaware in this movie, not sure of where her marks were and her demeanor as the 'love interest' was lost in translation. Now, what was the 'okay' part here? Why the CGI, of course. But, keep in mind even good CGI does not a good movie make. Remember Transformers?Violence: Yes. Sex: Not really. An attempt was made but they fell off the bed. Nudity: No. Language: No and that was a break.Rating: C",5,0,2,9 October 2008

Cristina is game, but Vicky is not, but the point here is the dialogue that took place in this exchange was the best give and take in any movie that I have heard in a long time. And,I thought: Woody is back. But, like a lot of comedies where the best stuff is in the beginning and then peters out as the movie goes on, the same thing happened here. If there was comedy or good lines later on, I missed them all or they went over my head (could happen). It turned out to be another TV soap opera and I lost interest. Woody was back only for the first 10-minutes of this movie. After that there was no hook and he gave up. Whoa! I lost interest only because of the story, not because of the stars like Ms. Johansson, Ms Hall (kind of looks like Scarlett ), and of course, Ms. Cruz. The acting by them and all others was fine. Mr. Bardem will be another Benicio Del Toro given better scripts. Mark my words.But, after that stirring exchange in the first 10-minutes when Juan introduced himself to Vicky and Cristina, the story petered out as did everything else and I was waiting for this to be over. Like I said it was like another TV soap opera going nowhere. A little too long too. Violence: No. Sex: Yes. Nudity: No. Language: No F-bombs, some GDIs",4,10,16,4 March 2009
Saving Mr. Banks," Excellent
","Trying to keep his promise to his daughters to make a movie from their favorite book, Mary Poppins, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) finds it most difficult dealing with the author P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson) who is extremely set in her ways regarding how the movie should be made. I never saw MARY POPPINS so I was at a disadvantage knowing what Mary Poppins was all about (how un-American of you not seeing the movie). We see that her novel has everything to do with her childhood and alcoholic father played by Colin Farrell. It takes Walt Disney quite a while to put all that together and his little talk with Ms. Travers near the end of the movie is nothing but pure gold. For a while - mostly in the beginning - I felt that Tom Hanks was miscast, but he won me over and I was convinced he was the perfect choice to portray Walt Disney (big of you).I do believe that Emma Thompson overplayed her part for most of the movie. I couldn't help thinking that before each scene she squirted down a few juicy lemons to make sure she came off as a priggish know-it-all uncompromising ultra-phony pseudo-intellectual. Or to put it another way she came off as a Real Bitch. And, that lemon juice did the job. But, to be fair, after that talk with Walt Disney she saved herself and I was okay with her. Yes, I knew she would turn, (hey, we all did) in time, to becoming a normal human being, but it did take a while. Anne Rose Buckley who played Ginty when Mrs Travers was a child should have gotten an Oscar Nomination for something. She was perfect. An excellent supporting cast of Ruth Wilson as Mrs. Goff (Travers' mother), Colin Farrell as Ginty's father (Travers Goff), Paul Giamatti as Ralph who was Ms. Travers' driver in LA, Bradley Whitford as Don DaGradi and B.J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the Sherman brothers who along with DaGradi performed all the musical rehearsals (really good too) for the movie. The technica-color aspect of the movie for most of the first half seemed to be a colorized version seen when movies were only made in black and white back in the day. Or maybe there was an over-abundance of make-up on the characters. Take your pick. Though I never saw the MARY POPPINS movie, this movie provided the connections between Mrs Travers' childhood and the Mary Poppins story. And, now the title SAVING MR BANKS makes sense. The little talk near the end, that Walt Disney made to P.L. Travers should go onto Youtube (there are some things there , but not that talk) so we can hear it over and over again. If you watch this movie on DVD, play back that talk a few times. It won't get old and it was the whole essence of the movie as far as I am concerned. I don't know if the real Walt Disney actually spoke those words but he should have but having known many nice things about Walt Disney he may very well have spoken those words. They were pure gold. (9/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Should kids watch: That's up to the parents. We do see some uncomfortable scenes when Ginty sees her father in an alcoholic state. Also Ginty saves her mother fromcommitting suicide in the lake. Language: No.",9,3,4,25 April 2014
Beowulf," Spectacular CGI Show
","Beowulf (Winstone) comes to King Hrothgar's (Hopkins) lands to fight the monster Grendel.Here's the thing. If you need to take a test on Beowulf, you best read the entire epic poem, or at the very least, find the Classic Comic Book (if it's still around) because Hollywood has done it again by deviating from the epic poem. So you will find very few answers in here. Yes, Woody Allen did tell Diane Keaton in Annie Hall that she should never take a course that makes you read Beowulf, but he should have also added 'or watch a movie that is historically incorrect.'So what are we left with? Why the CGI, silly. And wasn't this what it was all about? Some even saw it in 3-D. Imagine that. I wasn't so lucky and had to watch the old fashioned way on a DVD without 3-D. Poor me. The real winner here is the CGI. And, it was spectacular to say the very least. Yes, the acting was very good too, but the CGI was all of Oscar Worthiness. The cinematography rivaled Sin City, Bram Stoker's Dracula and the war scenes in Atonement. And, it must be assumed also that no CGI horses were harmed in any way in the filming of this movie. Now for the flaw in the Hollywood version of the story. Grendel's Mother (Jolie) lets Beowulf rule for 50 years and then pulls everything away. Why? What did Beowulf do to have that happen to him? What was his sin? It was never explained. Of course, in the real epic poem, Grendel's Mother was defeated by Beowulf at the time Grendel was defeated so there was never anything given to Beowulf by Grendel's Mother. See? (There must be a Classic Comic around somewhere, maybe on Ebay.)Yes, there was more cleavage going around than outright nudity in here. Angelina Jolie may have been fully naked, but there was nothing erotic about her. She was covered in a paint of some kind that had me looking to see what kind of paint was used. And, that could explain why the PG-13 rating.Enjoy the CGI with or without the 3-D glasses. That is what it was all about. And, they are spectacular (with apologies to Seinfeld).Violence: Yes, Sex: Not really, Nudity: Yes, but not erotic, Language: No, did they know any language in the 500s?",9,2,4,14 April 2008
Live Free or Die Hard," Probably the Best Action Movie Ever
","Why is someone shutting down the power grid on the entire east coast and causing chaos? John McClane (Willis) is escorting Matt Farrell (Long) a known computer hacker to DC to help stop the madness. Will they be in time?I have no idea how this movie was made. Was it all CGI or actual stunts that were the most impressive of any I have ever seen. I had to duck more than once to get out of the way of cars flying thru the air or bridges crashing down. Yes, this was all non-stop action, but wait a minute, there was time for actual conversations so I didn't feel like this was a computer game. No, this was as close to being real as I have ever seen. Most impressive. This just might be the action movie to judge all others by. I haven't seen Transformers yet, but I believe that is mostly CGI and yes, that is impressive as well from the promos I've seen.Flaws? Well, yes, there were a couple but this is not to take anything away from the overall effort. Besides, these flaws occur in all action movies. For instance a man with a machine gun cannot hit another man about 10-feet away from him. You see this all the time. One more classic example. Instead of putting a bullet into the enemy to end it all for that moment, the hero gives the opponent more screen-time by trying to see who knows more Judo or Karate moves. See? Movies could be shortened considerably by a well-placed bullet at the right time, butÂ…..Still, this is a very impressive movie. The acting, dialogue, cinematography were all outstanding, and the pace is perfect. But, make no mistake about this. This is an action-movie and is probably the best you will ever see.Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Not really, not the hard stuff anyway.",9,0,4,24 November 2007
Thor: The Dark World," It was okay. Watchable
","The Dark Elves want to destroy and shut out the light from the Universe. Their leader, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston) searches for the Aether, an indestructible force and finds it in Jane (Natalie Portman). Say what? Thor (Chris Hemsworth) must find a way to save Jane and defeat the Dark Elves. Thor needs the help of his brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who is in prison by order of his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins).This was okay, but the CGI sets showcased all you see and they are spectacular. The action scenes are very good. The only comedic lines were uttered by Loki and to be truthful Loki steals the show. I suppose the professor running naked at the Stonehenge site was funny to some, not to me. It wasn't funny and didn't add much to the story. Why have it? Not much happens between Thor and Jane although she had been waiting for his return for 2-years. This was okay, but the Convergence when the 9-Realms line up to a point when Malekith can use the Aether to destroy the known universe should have made us pause and be concerned, but that didn't happen. Things happened too fast and we knew Thor would be triumphant. It's really not good to say that we just didn't care, but we didn't. This was okay, but for a civilization as advanced like the Asgards their weapons of choice only seemed to be knives and swords and we did see the Dark Elves use what looked like ray-guns. Oh, yes, Thor has his Hammer. Knives and swords? Give me a break. This was okay only because of the action scenes and sets design and they were very good. Now for the dilemma: Two people die in this. What will a sequel bring us without them? One is kind of important to the Thor story. Huh? However, there is that scene at the very end that confused me and may confuse you too. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

Moonrise Kingdom," We were not amused
","This is a story, in 1965, about 2-teenagers (Sam and Suzy) who run away from their homes, and discover true friendship, love and some sex. The parents of Suzy (Kara Hayward) label her as 'troubled.' The parents of Sam (Jared Gilman) say they cannot cope with him anymore and write him a note not to come back when he runs away. The whole island gears up to find the runaways. The best thing about this movie is the music. Everything else is done in an extremely dead-pan way. You will, however, enjoy this movie if you are friends with Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel. They pull off the most dead-pan performances you will ever see, although you will see some animation with Keitel and Swinton. Maybe it was supposed to be that way, but hey, there is an audience out here and we were not amused. If the powers that be didn't want to involve the audience, they should have left it as a book, which was probably more exciting than this. Yes, some will say I didn't understand this at all. They could be right, but this was not entertaining and I was not amused. I kept checking the DVR to see how much was left. Did we care about anything? Well we enjoyed the interplay between Sam and Suzy, but even that was held at a distance from the audience (that would be us) and from themselves too. Their dialogues were on the dead-pan order too and came across as 'matter of fact.' In other words no real emotion and not 'dead-pan' funny. The sex was non-existent as it should have been considering the ages of the runaways. There was a copping a feel and attempts at French kissing at one point. Innocent enough and didn't last long. Again, did we care about anything? Yes, when would this be over.There was supposed to be a very big storm to come in and wreck everything. Give me a break. A little rain, wind, and sounds of thunder do not a storm make. So the storm didn't work.There is narration almost throughout, but it fell flat and why did they bother? That was an excellent chance to do inject some humor if humor wasn't going to show up in characters' dialogues. And, of course, it didn't. That is, unless you are friends with the stars mentioned above. I can hear them howling with laughter now. What do I really think? This deserves a Do-Over with a better script to include humor. Dead-pan humor is good when it is funny. This was not. (3/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Copping a feel: Yes, briefly. French kissing: Yes, briefly.

RED," Comfortable Thriller
","Frank Moses (Willis) is a retired CIA agent who needs to know why the CIA is trying to kill him and his former team.RED: Retired Extremely Dangerous. Got it? That applies to Frank.This is a comfortable thriller. Everything happens and goes wrong, but no matter, Frank is here and he's got everything under control. The movie is almost dreamlike in that everything is done in a somewhat subtle, but efficient way. Kind of seamless if you will. No one panics, no one overacts although Marvin (Malkovich) does give that a go from time to time, but Frank is there to restrain him. And, from time to time we do hear some good, almost LOL lines. Mary-Louise Parker's character, Sarah, plays Frank's love interest perfectly and one could very easily fall in love with her from the get-go. Morgan Freeman (Joe), Helen Mirren (Victoria), Richard Dryfuss (Alexander), Brian Cox (Ivan) and Rebecca Pidgeon (Cynthia) were all a joy to watch. Ernest Borgnine (Henry) - yeah, I thought so too, but there he was big as life - just gets better with age. But, it is Karl Urban (Cooper) who really steals the show. If they ever do a real life ARCHER (cartoon character kind of a James Bond), Mr. Urban would be my choice. He's perfect for that role. He is so good, you almost want him to catch Frank and his team. Come to think of it, he could also successfully play the new Superman. Think about it. Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one F-bomb by Karl Urban near the end.

Flight," Somewhat Entertaining
","Whip Witaker (Denzel Washington), a seasoned airline pilot, lands a malfunctioning plane and saves almost everyone. The problem arises when it is discovered that he had alcohol in his system at the time. He could go to prison. Somewhere in the beginning, we see Whip heroically land a plane that has malfunctions almost everywhere. These are exciting scenes, no doubt about it. That's why we go to a Denzel Washington movie. ButÂ…Â…..once the plane is landed what we get later on is a made-for-TV movie. Now, the struggle is his alcoholism and lying to everyone and he tells everyone he is not worried as no one else could have landed that plane the way he did. Okay, now we are getting somewhere. ButÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….So there we are waiting for the time when we actually believe Whip will take the corrective actions and get out of the mess he helped create. And, we wait, and wait and wait some more. While we wait we check to see what other movies are coming up, check the TV schedule also, do a bathroom break, check the refrigerator for a snack as not much is happening on the screen. Whip is still drinking and lying to everyone. We mutter to ourselves 'there has to be some way out of this' and so we wait some more. Yes, the acting all around is very good, but I wouldn't offer nominations for Oscars for any category. Denzel is very good, but he should have passed on this one. And, here we are left with a made-for â€“tv movie. Not bad, but stillÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â… (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, in the opening scenes Drug use: Yes. Language: Yes.",5,0,1,7 February 2013
Pitch Perfect," Shallow
","After joining a college all girl a cappella group Beca (Anna Kendrick) sees the group going nowhere unless some changes are made.How many of you knew there were a cappella singing groups on college campuses? Everyone I asked had no idea there were such things. I didn't either. Yet, in here a big deal is made of them and we see several groups vying for first prize in the Nationals.What was wrong. The Barden Bellas, the group Beca joins hurt themselves the previous year when one of the lead singers vomited all over the stage during the finals. A new group was formed. Aubrey (Anna Camp) the leader, kept insisting on the same songs to win the competitions. Beca disagreed and felt a new direction was needed. The music and choreography were passable but one did notice a lot of lip syncing. One girl, who no one could hear because her words went back into her mouth as soon as they were spoken, was also a member of the group. Why? She couldn't project anything. Oh, I see, that was supposed to be funny? It wasn't . This was intended to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny anywhere. The script is shallow with Beca not wanting to be in college in the first place and has an on-going battle with her father regarding this. Rebel Wilson, who played Fat Amy, tried to lighten things up but that didn't work out. The girl who did vomit angels wasn't funny at all. Vomit Angels? Give me a break. The romantic angle with Beca and Jesse (Skylar Astin) was too contrived to be a serious thing and we just didn't care. With a title as Pitch Perfect I expected something more along the lines of the King's Singers who are the best at a cappella singing. SomethingÂ…Â….something close. Didn't happen.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Excellent Drama. Riveting
","President Snow (Donald Sutherland) fears that Katniss Everdeen's (Jennifer Lawrence) victory in the last Hunger Games threatens his rule and declares a Quell whereby the winners of all previous Games will go head-to-head with each other. And, he hopes Katniss will be defeated and not win giving Hope to the people to overthrow him.So here we go watching Katniss prepare for the new Games. She knows she must go through with it or her family will be murdered. She is grateful that, this time, young children will not be killed as in the last Games. And, gone is the benefit that a previous Hunger Games winner will enjoy a life of ease. Now all previous winners must participate and they don't like it. The first half of this is slow, but we are watching Katniss deal with everything and tension and suspense abound. The thing that struck me were the dialogues as they kept me riveted to my seat. The dialogues were spot on with honesty and subtle anger and humor at times. An example of subtle anger: Katniss tells the President, 'why don't you kill me now?' Of course Snow would like to, but he needs everything to be legal and so the Quell. Snow still fears Hope among the people and Katniss as the cause of it, and that must be put to rest.We are introduced to the other players, but once the Games begin, we only see bits and pieces of them. What we don't see are the people watching on TV like we saw in the first movie. All in all, this is excellent drama and we have the same fears as Katniss and are wary of everything around usÂ…. um, I mean her. Plutarch (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is the one we are most wary about as he is the Games Master and pulls all strings (read obstacles) during the Games. We need to watch him very carefully. One of the most dramatic scenes is when Katniss is introduced to the people again, and she comes out in a wedding dress and what happens next tells President Snow that he is being mocked. Great stuff. The acting by all is excellent but, Jennifer Lawrence must be singled out as she is perfect. And, the questions begin: will Katniss go with Team Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) or Team Gayle (Liam Hemsworth)? Will the Hunger Games finally stop? Will the revolution actually take place? Inquiring minds are at it again.The ending is too abrupt and we don't like it, but we are reminded that other sequels are in play and we will find out more in the next movie and we can't wait.

Looper," Enjoyable. Clever
","In the future, it is 2074 and Time Travel has been invented, but is also illegal. The MOB (the Mob will always be around) uses it anyway to send someone they want whacked back 30-years where a Looper, an assassin who closes the loop and shoots him and disposes of the body. Young Joe (Gorden-Levitt) is a Looper and because Time Travel is as complicated as it is, a now Older Joe (same guy) (Bruce Willis) comes back from 2074. Now Young Joe sees himself as Older Joe and he needs to whack Older Joe. What to do? What to do? But, Older Joe escapes and has an agenda and that is to find and kill the Rainmaker, who will abolish Loopers.This was quite enjoyable. Here is the best way to view Time Travel and enjoy the show. Remember when you dreamed, everything in the dream made sense? In a conscious state, of course, these things would not, could not make sense. But treat Time Travel as a dream where everything makes sense and you will be fine. Anyway, I hope the explanation above gives you a good reference for what you are about to see. The entire cast performed well. The stunts and CGI were outstanding. Notables included Emily Blunt as the single mother, Paul Dano as a Gatman (okay a Looper), and Jeff Daniels as Abe, Young Joe's boss. A special shout-out is made for Jeff Daniels, with or without the beard, as he is good as bad guy, someone part of the Mob or a questionable politician. Take your pick. One more shout-out and that is for Cid (Pierce Gagnon), the child of Sara (Emily Blunt) who acted well beyond his years. Kudos. All in all very clever and quite enjoyable. (8/10)Violence: Yes.

Get Him to the Greek," Too Foul, not funny
","Aaron Green (Hill) has 72-hrs to get a fading rock star Aldous Snow (Brand) to the comeback concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.I thought this movie would be a complete disaster. In the beginning all I heard was obscene language, watched obscene sight gags, watched barfing as though the whole world thought that was funny, and listened to sexually explicit songs and also listened to fouled mouthed people who had no fear of using sexual body parts as part of their normal conversations. I wanted to shut this down, but I took a chance and waited until all the ugliness was out and eventually most of it was out, not entirely, mind you, but the worst parts were over. Then the story started. Oh, there were still foul mouthed people spewing their stuff, but it became no different than any other movie with bad language. Good God, am I getting used to this stuff?To continue a little bit with the story, Aaron has a very hard time getting a difficult out-of-control drugged up rock star to do what he must do to get back his rock-star career back. But, in order to get the job done and appease this rock star, Aaron ends up doing things he doesn't want to do, drink a lot, do drugs and have sex with other women. Have to admit some of those scenes were only funny when he was out of it via drink, and drugs and was not very graceful on his feet. There should have been more of those scenes because some slapstick was definitely called for. Otherwise nothing else was funny. What held me was the performance of Russell Brand. He was in his element or zone and although he also spewed foul language as called for in the script, he sometimes mumbled but you got the gist of what he was saying and that was sort of a reprieve for me not to hear the words. Jonah Hill was kind of miscast as he brought nothing to the table because his character was too low-keyed and he was not given any memorable lines. He was only funny when he was knocking things over in his drunken druggy stupors. Surprisingly that worked. Cameos: Mario Lopez, Billy Bush, Pink, Christine Aguilera, Meredith Vieria and others of lesser notoriety. Why these foul mouthed comedies appeal to the populace is beyond me, but they continue to try to outdo the previous same kind of foul mouthed sexual misadventure 'comedic' movies. Comedy in America is dead. Now, all we have is bathroom humor. Sad. Soooo, not a complete disaster, but real close. Violence: No Sex Yes. Nudity: Yes. Drug usage: Yes.

Cloud Atlas," Connections Are Us
","We follow 6-stories that seem to reflect reincarnated people with the same birthmark and this is supposed to be proof of that. The main theme is: 'our lives are not our own, we belong to each other, past and present' as stated by Doona Bae's character Sonmi 451. This is to say we are all connected. We see slices of life within these stories and it takes a while to make some sense of things we can relate to. We go on an ocean voyage where a doctor is trying to get the key to a strong box full of gold; a gay composer writes letters to his friend and contemplates suicide; a murder at a nuclear power plant; a publisher as a prisoner in a nursing home put there by his brother; a Korean rebel â€“ Sonmi 451 - in the future, who may be the key to saving the world; and we see Zachry (Tom Hanks) a Polynesian tribesman who has contact with Meronym (Halle Berry) who is from another planet. Many of the stars in here play a character in all six stories. You can make a game of it trying to decide which stars you recognize with all the makeup, prosthetics, wigs and costumes. Here are some of the other names: Jim Broadbent, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, James D'Arcy, Hugh Grant, David Keith. The acting and visuals and CGI are most impressive. What was annoying was the pidgin English dialogue when in the tribesman Zachry stories. Oh, they sounded good, almost poetic, but we came away with: Whadee say? Whashe say? See? When Zachry needed to know the truth about something, he would say: Tell me the true true. Okay we got that, but that was the easiest of all the pidgin English we heard. The only story I found most interesting was with Doona Bae's rebel character Sonmi 451 who was protected by Hae-Joo Chang (Jim Sturgess) who behaved like James Bond in his efforts. He knew Sonmi 451 was the only one who could save the world, a world gone mad with oppression. Later when she was captured and her Interrogator says to her that she must have known she could not win and why persist? Sonmi 451 agrees but says the truth must not be hidden. The Interrogator then says suppose no one knows and she replies: someone will come along and know. She knows she will be killed and she is not afraid because 'death is just another door opening.' As far as I was concerned the other 5-stories were okay, but not as important as Sonmi 451's story. Why the title Cloud Atlas? The theme here is that we are all connected as are clouds we see and sometimes we see images, and stories within these clouds. This movie is about 3-hours long and we don't get bored, but we wished some stories were shorter than they were. In those stories the birthmark was the only thing connecting all to reincarnation, but there was no apparent connection to the story of Sonmi 451. Unless one could take a giant leap and say that oppression was in their future. Maybe I missed the birthmark on Sonmi 451. HmmmÂ…Â….The movie starts out with Zachry and we think this is the beginning like he is in the BC time-frame era, but he is not. Zachry is in a post- apocalyptic world and oppression was not in his future, as he went to that other planet with Meronym. See? A happy ending for him. What about the rest of us? Woe is us. Hey, we are left behind. Any help out there? AnyoneÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â….? (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, 3-instances, all hetero. Nudity: Yes, 2-instances, and a male backside. Gays in bed: Yes.

The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," It was okay
","Bella (Stewart) has a decision to make and things become complicated with the emergence of new Vampires who want to destroy the Cullens.Well, here we are again. The last one in the Twilight Saga trilogy. Are we having fun yet? I suppose the answer to the question 'which way will Bella go' is uppermost on most inquiring minds. So that was one plot, the other was the new Vampires and their plans to defeat the Cullens. This was more like a soap opera (weren't they all?) and the only action this time we saw was the big battle in the open field between the New Vampires and the Cullens with help from the Wolves. The CGI was again terrific and the battle seemed very real. Hey, I cringed at times.This was somewhat hard keeping up with the story line in the beginning because of the great length of time between this movie and the last one and I had forgotten what some of the other characters were involved with. But, no matter as I just concentrated on the Bella decision and I knew a battle would be waged between the New Vamps and the Cullens. That is all you really need to know.There were some good lines in the beginning. Perhaps the best one was when in the Student Union the talk was about the upcoming graduation celebration. One girl said they should make it extremely good as 'how often do we graduate from High School?' The camera then pans to Edward, who has that wry knowing smile on his lips. And, the Valedictorian speech at the graduation ceremony was perhaps one of the best I have ever heard. Very good. Too long to recount here. This was okay and we now have closure. But, I cannot help thinking that every time I will see Robert Pattinson in future movies I will still think of him as a Vampire and will keep waiting for him to show off those Vampire powers. A long wait, I know. I have to get over it. As for Ms Stewart, I have seen her in other movies where she actually showed more than two facial expressions. I have to give her more credit in here than I have in the past. To do this one has to believe in Vampires and Werewolves. Her character believes so for her this is a very serious situation and there really isn't much to smile about when you have Vampires and Werewolves running loose. See? Maybe a part of the problem is that many in the audience don't understand her plight. See? Give her a break.All in all, this was okay. We are done with this now, aren't we?Violence: Yes.

The Ugly Truth," Too Raunchy and a Bad Script
","Abby (Heigl) is forced to increase ratings of the TV show she produces by allowing Mike (Butler) to show the women in the TV audience what men really want from women.After 10-minutes, I shut this down. Too embarrassing to watch. Nothing funny, no good lines. The only thing it had going for it was watching Katherine Heigl. Then I tried again the next day hoping it got better, but shut it down again after an additional 10-minutes. Simply really bad and crude dialogue mostly by Mike (Butler) who was a non-stop Raunch Machine. Even the beautiful and talented Heigl fell into the trap and mouthed a few unfunny more-than-risquÃ© lines. Enough was enough. So now the DVD sits waiting to go back to Red Box where no one should ever take it out. Will the movie save itself? Probably, but I will never know after experiencing the first 20-minutes head start of garbage it produced. Yes, I know a lot of people like the dirty talk, especially hormonal 7th and 8th graders. But, they, too, grow up at some point. Let's hope. Sometimes the risquÃ© has it's place and is funny, but not in here.When I found out that three women actually sat down and wrote this, I kind of understood why all the raunch. Apparently, good lines, and comedy take a back seat to x-rated dialogue. Perhaps they felt they had to prove something. Oh, wait a minute, they thought they were writing funny stuff. HA!I did laugh at one thing. Abby's cat poking his head into the goldfish bowl trying to get at the goldfish.A magic show is mostly successful because we do not know how the illusions were done. We are not shown what made the trick work. In this movie all nuts and bolts were shown to us and there was no magic.I like Katherine Heigl and I hope in the future she takes more time in deciding what scripts to indulge in.Maybe I should try it again, this time without sound. HmmmmmÂ…Â…Â…Â….Violence: Not sure, didn't watch it all the way to the end, but I doubt it. Sex: No. I think they let the raunchy dialogue speak for itself. Nudity: No, ditto.

Moon," Good Sci-Fi
","Sam Bell (Rockwell) is the man on the moon in the last 2-weeks of a 3-yr contract, monitoring mining operations for a mineral that earth needs to solve its energy problems. He is alone except for Gerty (voice of Spacey) a computer that monitors Sam's health, the mining operation and the base station. Suddenly he gets sick and this almost causes a fatal accident outside the station. Then he realizes he is no longer alone. At first I thought, 'well, here we go again with imaginary friends' and 'let the ripoff continue.'But, it's not that. The other person is a spitting image of himself and Sam doesn't know what to make of this. And, he gets no help from Gerty who will not answer his questions. But, since the other Sam doesn't seem to be a threat, Original Sam goes about his business and eventually confronts the 'other Sam.'This is good Sci-Fi, but there are some holes. Why would the company that Sam works for only allow one man to monitor the mining operation? Maybe the thinking is that Gerty would be enough. HmmmÂ…Â…. Big clue concerns Sam's sickness, and a 3-yr contract. Can you figure it out?Original Sam does have some hallucinations: he sees a woman, not his wife, sitting in a chair. The woman hallucination is never explained. And, the accident is caused by his having another hallucination of the same woman outside the station. Again, never explained. Maybe hallucinations don't need to be explained and they are what they are. And, one more thing. A computer is not supposed to show emotion, but there are a few instances whereby Spacey got too involved and we hear some emotion in his voice. Not really a hole, but the computer's name of Gerty is never explained. Well, the name of HAL in 2001 was never explained until later on. The closest I can come is that Gerty is based upon a Jewish mother's name: Gertrude Goldberg (from the Goldbergs TV show back in the day) or was that Molly and not Gertrude? I give up, but it's the closest I can come. The Jewish mother reference is about someone who takes care of everything, like Gerty does. Get it? Tough room. All in all a very good Sci Fi movie and I would have nominated Sam Rockwell for an Oscar (yes, I'm still handing them out).Violence: Yes.

Slumdog Millionaire," It was okay
","Malik (Patel) goes on a TV game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire in the hope that his long lost love Latika (Pinto) sees him and still cares. The setting is India.If the powers that be wanted a FEEL GOOD movie to win Best Picture they got their wish. It was okay. I wouldn't have nominated it for Best Picture (it won for that), and I certainly wouldn't have nominated the Director for the Best Director Award (it won for that too). (Don't hold back Bob, tell us how you really feel)The beginning of this movie was confusing. I had no idea what was going on, the scenes shifted so fast and the sub-titles came and went with the wind. The sub-titles were too small, often yellow on a gold background and they didn't stay on the screen too long even if they weren't yellow on gold. I never did take that speed reading course. Oh, and get this: the sub-titles were not always in the same place, like on the bottom of the picture where sub-titles usually are. No, you had to look for them depending on who was speaking. Creative, but annoying. Also, the Nervous Camera was much in evidence quite a bit in the beginning. And, a lot of the scenes were dark like it was always night time. I almost shut it down.But, I figured out the key and just let everything go and then half of the movie came around and things began to make sense and, thank God, things slowed down so we could all understand what was going on. Sort of. And, the sub-titles went way, good riddance. And, you will (like me) figure out all the answers to the questions put to Malik on the show. Very clever, I must say. Really clever. Reminded me of The Usual Suspects (great movie, btw).But, here is the KEY for those of you who really try to follow everything in the beginning: THIS IS A LOVE STORY. As long as you know that and you remember the names Malik and Latika, that is all you really need to know. Don't bother to memorize anything else. You'll hurt yourself like I did. The music from time to time was very good (won for Best Original Score and for Best Original Song).Why everyone went ga ga over this is beyond me. It's okay. The acting all around is excellent, but ga ga? No way. I guess the other nominated movies weren't of the Feel Good ilk. And, we want to feel good, don't we? Huh?Violence: Yes.

The Runaways," Sort of Incomplete, but okay
","A girl Rock and Roll band is formed in the 1970s and we see their rise and fall. This is based upon a true story. Since I was overseas during the 1970s I had no idea who these girls were as I never heard of them and apparently their music never made it out of the U.S. except to Japan. But, I have heard favorable things about the group. So onwardÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Oh, one more thing. I did hear this group paved the way for other girl bands, but I cannot think of one girl band â€“ ever - at this moment, and I don't think a few more moments would help. Well, there is BOND, but they all do violins. Very good btw. Anyway, onwardÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett actually showed emotions in the movie and was very good. Dakota Fanning was terrific, but I got the feeling her heart really wasn't in it. Of course, that also sums up the character of Cheri Currie she played, but I still had that feeling. Twice I saw her eyes go to the director of this as the director must have yelled 'Cut.' The Editor wasn't on his toes if I am correct about that. This is not her type of movie, but she does have range. No doubt about that. But, most impressive was, without a doubt, Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley their producer, and Rock and Roll star-maker so to speak. He is such a presence that if he had more screen time, it would have been his show. Production-wise sometimes it was like watching a movie thru a Kaleidoscope and this made everything incomplete. Too many scenes were in the dark. There is a lot of language, and sexual content and the ever-present drug use/abuse. But, overall, I maintain we really didn't get to know Joan Jett or Cheri Currie and, after all, it was their story or so I thought. They were pulled along by Kim Fowley and everything was non-stop at breakneck speed. Maybe that was the point. Was somewhat disappointed in the songs as I don't think we were given a proper sampling of all the Runaways did. When the credits ran at the end, I heard a song I thought should have been within the movie. It was very good. And, it may have been sung by the real Runaways.And, it would have been nice if there was a scene whereby they discussed what the name of the band should be. Yes, we got the idea from the little up close and personals we did see, but, sometimes a little trivia is a good thing. There were at least three other girl band members but they were not featured in here. It was mostly Jett and Currie. The credits at the end said Joan Jett was a producer of this movie and that it was based upon a book by Cheri Currie. Jett still performs, but Currie is a chainsaw artist some place in California. Read into all that what you will. And, Kim Fowley sporting green hair walks with a cane along Sunset Strip. Violence: No. Sex: Yes. Nudity: No, bare behinds from time to time. Sexual content: Yes.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Give Us a Break
","Transformers (2011) (Dark Side of the Moon) Shia LaBeouf, Josh Dumahel, John Tuturro, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, John Malcovich, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand. The Good Robots (Autobots) and the Bad Robots (Decepticons), who want to destroy the earth are at it again. That is all you really need to know.Give us a break. However, if you want to experience bad acting throughout, listen to dubbed dialogue, watch disjointed scenes, sit through never-ending Robot battles, listen to mumbling dialogue when it isn't dubbed and be exposed to a very weak script, then this is for you (don't hold back Bob, tell us how you really feel).The CGI is wonderful, but wonderful CGI does not a movie make. The Robot fighting scenes go on for too long, probably still going on, but they are spectacular. Can't deny that. And, they even threw in some really good eye-catching landscape scenery, but no one worked on the story. I couldn't figure out what was going on for the longest time except to (kind of) figure out that the Decepticons wanted to destroy the earth. Again, that is all you really need to know. Game On.

The Social Network," Good Story and Informative
","This is the true story how Mark Zuckerberg (Eisenberg) started FACEBOOK.I wasn't going to review this movie because I am not a FACEBOOK user or fan and have no interest in having potentially hundreds of people knowing what I am doing or even asking me what I am doing , what my favorite color is etc. I couldn't handle that. I have heard so much about how good this movie was that I caved. So here we are. Yes, FACEBOOK is a major force out there and it will be with us until the end of time, I suppose. I have been asked by family and friends to join. I write them in another email that I have no interest in FACEBOOK, TWEETERS, MY SPACE, whatever. One of the reasons is that hackers just love all of this and try to steal identities and I don't need that. The trick is not to put so much personal info on one of these sites.Back to the movie. I also wanted to see if this movie would encourage me to join FACEBOOK. Will get back to you on that. Back to the movie. Really, this time. The story about how FACEBOOK happened is quite good. We see how Zuckerberg kind of gets the idea from the Harvard Winklevoss twins, but expands on it big time to such a point the twins sue him. But, to be fair, Zuckerberg had already started a college-only FACEBOOK hacking into the university data base to obtain pictures of the women there and showing two at a time and asking which one is preferred.Later, Zuckerberg runs into Sean Parker (Timberlake) who started NAPSTER and gives Zuckerberg contacts galore out in California. Parker also has a hand in ousting Co-Founder of FACEBOOK, Eduardo (Garfield) and Eduardo also sues Zuckerberg. So we see the lawyers around the big table taking depositions and the rest of the story is told in flashbacks. All done quite well.There are some downsides. The Casting Director only chose people who could talk at super sonic speed and boy, did they ever ? No time for reflection, just yammer away, and boy, did they ever? One really had to pay attention not only because everyone talked at light speed, but also because the music was so loud so often it was difficult to hear what anyone was saying during the flashbacks and there were many. The music didn't need to be as loud as it was. Understand about parties and loudness, but we, in the audience (remember us?), were having difficulty following everything coming out of the very-fast talkers. Somehow we managed to figure it all out. We think. It's a good story and is nominated for Best Picture, but I wouldn't go that far unless there will be a remake and the downsides above corrected. Honestly they were quite distracting. But, I would nominate Justin Timberlake for Best Supporting Actor. He was the breath of fresh air in here. Jesse Eisenberg performed exceptionally well as he always does. The rest of the cast were right on as well. It was nice to see David Selby (TV show: Falcon Crest fame back in the day) again. He played one of the lawyers. Now, if you want to know the outcomes of everything, you could ask a friend on FACEBOOK, or watch the movie. It is informative and quite entertaining. And, no, I still have no interest in it. I am waiting for the movie about who started TWITTER and hope the same Casting Director won't be used. One can always hope.

The Great Gatsby," Mesmerizing
","Rich man Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) befriends Nick Carraway (Toby McGhuire), but his real intention is to get close to Nick's cousin, Daisy (Carey Mulligan), who is currently married to Tom Buchanan (Joel Edgerton). Oh, oh! This is basically a love story. Okay, a rich man's love story. I think we might have more of an appreciation for Classic stories if they were updated into modern times, somewhat. Hey, I said 'somewhat.' Not a reboot, but like this one with upbeat music, some CGI and, yes, narration that helps fill in the blank parts in a story. Why? Because it all worked in here. I was mesmerized.I do not understand why DiCaprio has not been awarded an Oscar. He is a very talented actor all the time, and he makes everyone around him better and it definitely showed in here. I was surprised at all the other characters' performances. I have new respect for Toby Mcguire, Carey Mulligan and the best - other than DiCaprio's performance - was Joel Edgerton's character Tom Buchanan. They were perfect. From time to time, you will see sentences appear on the screen as Nick narrates. These words are some of F.Scott Fitzgerald's writing and this was most clever. Kudos. It doesn't matter that Carey Mulligan was not the most beautiful woman that could have played Daisy. Her looks give off that very pretty, perpetual youthful look. And, as far as Gatsby was concerned 'the heart wants what the heart wants.' End of story. We cared about Gatsby - although for a long time we really didn't know anything about him (that comes later) â€“ and wanted him to succeed. Maybe he reminds us of someone we wanted and couldn't get for whatever reason. Again, end of story. In a rich man's environment you would expect the sets to be grandiose and most beautiful and they were. The music and limited CGI were spot on as was the cinematography. In the beginning you will hear that many people knew very little about Gatsby and were those stories about him true? But, then again, he threw spectacular parties and who cares? You will be told the truth, in time. You will find out where Gatsby's money comes from. Why he waited 5-years before looking Daisy up again since he left abruptly back in the day. You will also learn Gatsby's real story and how he came to be The Great Gatsby in the minds of the many. How good is that? See, the Classics don't have to be boring.

The Proposal," Okay, but.............
","Canadian Margaret Tate (Bullock)is a hated boss, but her Visa is expiring and she proposes to marry her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) to be able to stay in the United States. This had huge comedic possibilities but the script wasn't up to the effort. If the promos hadn't shown the Betty White scene 10,000 times where her character is fitting Margaret with her old wedding gown it could have had, at the very least, one LOL moment. Didn't happen. The script was bland and okay for a made-for-TV movie. And, reallyÂ…Â…. in a movie like this where the main characters who don't like each other, end up liking each other (Oh, you didn't know that would happen? HA!) someone should try to match actors that have a good chemistry so we could all feel good at the end. Didn't happen. I didn't care if the pairing, proposal, or 'marriage' would work. Did anyone? Also, I think the ending should have gone another way. Would have made more sense. No, I can't tell you what the ending is and what I wanted. Needless, useless and not funny scenes: every one with Ms Bullock and the dog, and the male stripper scene in the bar. I want to say the acting overall was good, and it was, but there were some over-acting moments with Bullock and the dog and I couldn't wait for them to be over with. Do people actually watch the scenes before it goes out to the public? HmmmmÂ…Â…Â….Yes, Ryan Reynolds looks like Ben Affleck. I thought it was Affleck and had to check the DVD box. They look the same, act the same, and have basically the same expressions. Think I'll check the box again. Betty White is a treasure no matter how many times a scene with her is shown. Other treasures are Nelson and Steenburgen and they did good as did the rest of the cast. I thought we would at least see a family dinner along the way. Didn't happen. The breakfast-in-bed thing doesn't count.Overall, an okay movie that has been hyped to death. I get the feeling that Ms Bullock wants to push the envelope with her partial nude scenes. Suggestion to her: Do it with a better script.Violence: No Sex: No. Nudity: Partial by both Bullock and Reynolds Language: No.",5,0,1,15 October 2009
Valkyrie," Quite Good
","Col Stauffenberg (Cruise) has a plan to kill Adolph Hitler to save Germany in the 1940s during WW II. This is based upon a true story.I would call this a history lesson except we already know the outcome and really didn't need to know the details. This 15th attempt to kill Hitler failed. End of story. Nice try, but they didn't get him. The acting by the entire cast was terrific, but no Oscar performances. There were a couple good choreographed explosions and a plane strafing, good troop movements, and the details of the ambitious plan were kind of interesting.The biggest thing in here is this: No one even attempted to speak German or English with a German accent and that was appreciated greatly because we understood what was going on. There were none of those, 'waddi say?' moments. Quite enjoyable if the details of the plan were true or not. Didn't matter. This was a serious moment in history and the presentation was excellent. What was missing? Suspense and tension. In real life, when this was actually going on, I am sure there were suspense and tension stretching to unbelievable lengths. But, not in here. Pity. That could have helped make this a little more than a history lesson and give us a real sense of dire consequences for the participants in the plan to kill Hitler. The pace of the movie was too fast to achieve suspense and tension as the scenes did move at a somewhat rapid pace. But, there was a lot to tell and because of that no room for suspense or tension. Pity. Suspense and tension could have given this movie more importance. Double pity. I wasn't going to watch this movie. The word was the acting wasn't any good and Tom Cruise spoke English in a German setting back in the day. HA! The acting all around was terrific and they all spoke English and because of that I understood and enjoyed everything.

Draft Day," Good Insight to NFL Draft Day
","NFL General Manager for the Cleveland Browns, Sonny Weaver (Kevin Costner), agrees to give away 3-number-one picks in succeeding years in order to get the number one rated College Quarterback in the nation. The rest of the movie he is trying to find out if he made a good or bad deal. All of his coaching staff believe he gave away too much, but owner Anthony Molina (Frank Langella) wants that QB so Cleveland can make a 'splash' in the NFL. How will this end? Inquiring Minds are on the job once more. This gives us some insight to the inner workings of the NFL drafting of college players who want to join the NFL. Okay, okay, it's somewhat like the MONEYBALL movie. There are fabulous shots of various NFL stadiums and there were many split-screens throughout and this gave credence to the story. The way it was done was impressive. The photography all around was excellent. Kudos. We see many nationally recognized football analysts (Jon Gruden, Chris Berman, Dion Sanders, Mel Kiper, Mike Mayock, to name just a few). Roger Goodell, the Commissioner of the NFL, also participated in the movie. There are some excellent flashbacks to other great NFL games when someone is trying to make a point regarding the present situation. Other supporting cast members include Chi McBride, Jennifer Garner (as Salary Cap Specialist and Sonny's girlfriend who is pregnant with his baby), Denis Leary (Cleveland coach), Sean Combs as Chris, an agent, and Sam Elliott as the coach who coached that Number One QB that Sonny makes that deal for.There are minor sub-plots that Sonny has to deal with: the pregnancy, of course, (but there isn't much of a love story here), his mother (Ellen Burstyn) wants to spread her husband's (he was the former coach of the Browns) ashes on the 50-yard line on a practice field, the current QB who fears losing his job if that Number One QB is taken, and a son of a former Cleveland Brown player who wants to be a Brown.And then there is Sonny who is trying to make his mark and you see his concerns dealing with everything trying to stay focused on this Draft Day as he calls other NFL GMs to learn more about that number one QB and to make possible deals too. As you would expect the pace picks up near the end and it is here that Kevin Costner earns his money. He did a good job. All in all a good movie, maybe a little slow, at times, but when you see the pressures an NFL General Manger goes through you will understand and enjoy this. And, if you are a true football fan, you will enjoy even more. (7/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Only one F-bomb uttered.",7,1,2,3 September 2014
The Fighter," Great Movie
","Micky Ward (Walhberg) must deal with his dysfunctional family including loose cannon and drug addict half brother Dicky Eklund (Bale) to attain some prominence in the boxing world.This is based upon a true story. However, all was not forthright in here; Ward did win some titles in 1996 (WBU Intercontinental Light Welterweight: Title and Defense of it) but the movie never mentions them; Ward's broken right hand was fixed via surgery in a hospital, not thru exercise and pounding his fist in sand as the movie indicates; and it was his brother Dicky who convinced him to continue boxing after the broken hand healed. But, the movie would have you believe Ward started to win titles when he won the London bout in 2000. (So you didn't like the movie?) Are you kidding, it was great. My only problem is that they don't tell the whole truth in these 'based upon a true story' stories. (So you were disappointed then?) Not at all. No, it is still a great movie. You couldn't make this stuff up the way things went. The dysfunctional family, especially the mother was tough getting used to. (So that ticked you off?) Yes, it did, but although I didn't know the outcome of anything, I figured there had to be a silver lining in here somewhere. (And, was there one?) Yes. The acting was superb by all. It was like we eavesdropped into a not-so-normal boxing family where everyone went after everyone with fists, pushing and shoving and F-bombs flying all over the place. The dialogue was brutal, and honest. It was great except for the F-bombs.(So now, how do the Rocky films, and Million Dollar Baby stack up against this one?) Well, those movies were great but this one was true, for the most part; and that makes a difference. (What about Raging Bull?) OK, I forgot about that one. And, that was a great movie too. (Christian Bale received a Best Supporting Oscar for his role and you are okay with that?) Absolutely, but for a while there I thought it was his movie and Wahlberg was the supporting guy. I am here to be entertained and I was. A great movie. (Were the fighting sequences real?) They looked very real to me. I ducked a couple times. (Do you think it should have won Best Picture?)

Law Abiding Citizen," Good Thriller. Intense.
","Clyde Shelton's (Butler) family was brutally murdered via a home invasion. Clyde blames Nick (Foxx), his lawyer, for making a deal that lets one suspect testify against the other in order to get a light sentence. Clyde has plans to show Nick you do not make deals with murderers. And, those plans are spectacular. I was not ready for them. But, considering that Clyde gives himself up after killing the other suspect in his family murder, it was too early in the movie for this to be over. So I wanted to know more. I was hooked. Nick was fond of saying that it's not about justice, it's about what you can prove in court and Clyde took it all to heart. What a guy.I am not that familiar with Gerard Butler except to have seen him in one ditzy chick flick so this intense drama showed me something more about him. And, it was all good. I expected him to go on a rage like a Mel Gibson character when someone does something bad to his family. But, this was not Clyde's plan. Hard to do anyway since he was locked up in jail. I would almost say this was a good cat and mouse story, but here it was all cat. Clyde's in jail and he's making demands. How good is that?Very good thriller and the pace is perfect.

He is single, loves his job and prefers being on the road (so to speak) and has no ties to anyone.I can see why this was nominated for Best Picture. It's very good. Okay, it's more than that - it feels more like an old pair of shoes we will never throw away because they are always comfortable. I hated to see it end. This is a very comfortable movie. The actors make it so. I am not familiar with Vera Farmiga, but her performance was seamless throughout and she was deserving of a nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Also, the Efficiency Expert Natalie (Kendrick) did a good job, but am not sure if a Best Supporting Actress nomination was in order (well, some believed it was and she got the nomination too). And, I think we are beginning to see deeper ranges in George Clooney. He has those expressions that show us how he feels at times, and you feel it too. You like his character and want the best to happen for him. I was not surprised he was nominated for Best Actor.But, the acting aside, the thing that also makes this comfortable is the dialogue. The characters say what you would say if you (okay, if I ) were in those positions. Yes, the movie is slow, but hey, it's not a Jason Bourne thing. We are looking at Ryan, who has no ties to anyone and then he meets Alex (Farmiga) and begins to reconsider by falling in love with her. He's up in the air about it and about his life in general.

Atonement," Good, but too long
","A young girl (Ronan) tells a lie that literally destroys some lives. As an adult she tries to atone for that lie.I cringe when I hear about an Award type movie with Britons as the characters knowing I will go see it, but also knowing that I will cringe because I cannot understand what they are saying because the director has the characters talking way too fast. I have gone on record to say that all British movies must have Michael Caine talking all the male parts and Jane Seymour doing all the female parts. At least when those two speak I can understand what they are saying. Is that too much to ask? Apparently so. The Academy gave a Best Picture nomination to this movie because they couldn't understand what was being said also, and because the movie was British and understandably superior to American movies, they raved to everyone about it. The kicker is the people who were 'raved' to about the movie figured the Ravers knew what they were talking about even though they couldn't understand anything either. Hence a nomination. And, there you have it.I found the movie much too long. The war scenes went on forever. In fact I think they are still going on. This could have been a more satisfying movie if the idle chatter in the beginning among the idle rich and the war scenes were drastically cut back. They didn't need to be that long. Give the audience some credit to get the point. This isn't advertising where repetition rules the day. The acting was good, and the cinematography was excellent.I must say that the twist at the end was excellent and powerful and no one saw it coming. In fact, the twist was so powerful I am at odds whether or not the character who gave us the twist did the right thing. Did the twist atone for all that went on before? You must decide. I am at odds with it. But, without that twist, there would be no Oscar nomination, I am sure.(Okay, Bob, so you admit the story had merit and that it wasn't only nominated because no one could understand the dialogue?)
