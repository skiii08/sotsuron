The Blair Witch Project," A well written, well acted, scary flick.
",This movie was incredible because it so unconventional. It strays from any other carved movie path and takes you to an uncharted part of terror. The true horror of the movie doesn't quite sink in until you watch it a second time. The acting is incredible and the use of the two cameras adds to the brilliance and horror. A must see.,10,1,3,5 August 1999
