The Double Life of VÃ©ronique," Very disappointing.
","Reviews of this movie were so positive that we were very disappointed. In fact, we only saw the Polish segment and the beginning of the French segment. We thought the movie pretentious, confusing, dull, and shocking (what on earth did the girl die of in the midst of quite stirring music?). Jacob is pretty, no doubt, but a bit of plot would not have been amiss.",3,11,42,11 January 1999
The English Patient," Enormous to do about very little
","Gorgeous cinematography and two beautiful actresses certainly give a movie a good start, but that's really all this movie has. Moreover, the lead actor, in what amounts to 2 roles (before and after the accident), plays an unattractive character, cold and monochromatic. In a somewhat pivotal scene, Laszlo stares at Katharine while he is dancing with her like an inexperienced young man who has read a book on how to dominate girls. Indeed, why Katharine would even look at Laszlo when she is married to the manifestly nicer and better looking Geoffrey, is the movie's biggest mystery. For the rest, although the movie is supposedly about World War II, there is almost no mention of politics, no mention at all of religion, nobody seems to have any place they have to be (in wartime, soldiers don't get to just hang around where they please), and the morals are suited to a rabbit hutch. Oh, and the Germans are brutal (how can you have a movie take place in the 1940s without a nice German torture scene?), the British are vulgar, and the Americans just plain stupid (the scene on the bridge). That this movie won 9 academy awards can only testify to the poverty of today's film industry.",Null,6,12,28 June 2002
Dirty Dancing," Wonderful
","A favorite movie, guaranteed always to make one feel good. The scene, a Jewish summer resort of the last generation, is very familiar to me as I played piano and directed musicals in just such resorts in the 1950s. Dirty Dancing has the feel of such resorts just right and without the Borscht Circuit shtick which can be very distancing for many people. The story is moving, the acting is just fine (my father was a doctor just like the Jerry Orbach character), and the dancing is great. I've seen the movie dozens of time and never tire of it.",Null,1,1,17 June 1999
Pi," Absolutely awful
","The camerawork is abominable, the acting is terrible, the story is vile - math genius is, naturally, nuts - the characters are anti-Semitic stereotypes (the paranoid genius slob, the older failure with a central European accent, the super-aggressive Hasid). I cannot say whether the movie improves after the first half hour or so, as I turned it off in utter disgust, but given what I saw I cannot believe that anyone involved in this trash would be able to put together a coherent scene. I've rated it a 1, but that isn't close to how bad it is.",1,5,11,27 January 2002
Men in Black," Waste of time.
","I can guarantee that there will no spoilers in these comments, for there is no story to spoil. Superb special effects, very noisy soundtrack, excellent acting, a couple of cute lines and sight gags, no story at all. Normally, I would respond to so boring a movie by pressing stop and rewind after 20 minutes or so, but the visuals were so good I watched till the end. Then I was really sorry for wasting so much time. Where have all the writers gone?",3,6,14,24 July 2002
The Matrix," Disappointing
","Terrific special effects, very noisy, no story, less wit, sophomoric (high school sophomore) philosophy/theology. And what a shame our heroes couldn't use their spectacular technology to, say, synthesize a nice cold bottle of Moet champagne and extrude some Baccarat crystal to drink it from, instead of gruel in tin plates.",4,4,9,21 April 2001
