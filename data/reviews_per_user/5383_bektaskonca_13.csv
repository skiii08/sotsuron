The Avengers," Avengers spectacular
","i haven't given very many films nine captain America being the biggest let down on superhero movies coming out now days. i was cautious to see this movie because it was a huge budget with lots of famous cast as captain America was but i had to see it as i did others. i was surprised of the cast given all they can in this made this one of the best i have seen in 2012 but still i could not give 10 stars as i did with THOR. i loved all the actors and actresses in this movie but i felt as Paltrow should have given a bigger role as she only given short scenes in this movie. i love the Hiddleston he is destined for more great movies maybe playing mephisto and sepritoth in a final fantasy movie a great actor. most of all Downey jr. stood out because of hes great acting skills he become a guarantee bet on movies now days a household name lol. reason i could not give 10 stars this film lost that 1 star in the cutting room film jumped in places some characters did not get screen time they should have such is hulk, captain America, nick furry, and as i mentioned before Paltrow. other then that visually spectacular action movie should be seen on big screen 3d if it wont kill your eyes",9,3,7,24 June 2012
Men in Black 3," mib cash cow
",i really don't understand the fact of movies cashing in from the first success. yes the first was great and the second was OK but this one could have had a better story on the plus side it had great acting by every one so it made it watchable. i have to say i was entertained with the action. i did not like the bad guy in the movie he was not tough enough last fighting scene was too short too quick. Brolin was perfect for the fact Jones acted a small part and even then it felt like some one was holding a gun to hes had to be in this film. film will entertain almost all ages but not a film i would run to a store to buy unless it is a bargain shelf,7,0,3,24 June 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," what a miss fire
",just when i was having the best time of my life seeing all marvel characters coming to life on big screen such as thor i rated 10 out of 10. then this comes alone i had all the hopes that this will be another great movie until the end but still puzzled did i went to the right screen. reality pulled me out from daze then it turned in to anger who the hell directed and financed this movie i started mumbling to myself i think every one though i was a mental case out on a day release. honestly who the hell financed and made this pile of xxxx lol. i mean it had one of the few greatest actors of our time we all know it had one of the best superhero story told in 50 years what went wrong. i tell you what did directing specially on action scenes is felt cold no suspense trough the film. cgi sucked all in all early versions of captain America was far more superior to this i felt cheated as i did with George Lucas last 3 star wars they should have never been made as such as this. i have to tell you that i rated this high due to fact i love the acting of tommy lee Jones . Stanley tucci . Hugo weaving but there is only so much they can do it was not enough to save this film,6,0,3,6 September 2011
Kung Fu Panda 2," awesome panda is back for more
",i would have rated this 10 stars if this was the first part but as it stands not being original i could rate generous 8. i loved the story as it went back to roots of kung fu movies revenge for family members. i have to say as film releases goes this day this panda might just win the best actor award lol. action was none stop humour was great if i would not be a shame i would say great acting by all the animals lol. it just felt that good. great camera work good directing as voice overs go it is just perfect. i would recommend this film to all ages and nations it is just awesome. so make it kids day out and go see the movie well recommended,8,0,1,11 June 2011
Django Unchained," Django D is silent
","i have to say i loved the film best part of the movie was played by Samuel L. Jackson, i myself got to the point wanting to strangle him. i thank every one who made this film and all acted in it, this might be the best film of 2013. this film is a must see i can recommend it to every one over 18, keep it in mind film is very violent lots of nudity and torture scenes in it not for the faint hearted. i myself loved the film due to acting and all the action. N word is used a lot in this film in a very offencive ways it made me feel sick but the give the reality of the times it was needed. all i can say is watch this movie it is one of the best movies i have seen.",8,0,3,6 January 2013
The Hangover Part II," almost watchable
","wow they tried all here even adding a monkey. i am not saying film was a waste of time, but if i wanted to watch hangover again i would see the first one again.i do not know who financed the movie i think he was betting on successes of the first movie. i just felt cheated being charged money to see the same film again. i have to say acting was great like the first film. there were few action very few, they should have kept the monkey all thru the film it might have been more interesting. only bit i laughed was the monk scene and that was too short. all the best bits was there in trailers so my advice is to watch the trailers or if you get it cheap on DVD see it.",5,0,0,11 June 2011
Super 8," one time watch at best
",i have to say film had potential to be the next ET but failed even getting close to it. on the positive side it had good acting from the cast so downfall of this film was not their fault. directing was way of target film jumped from one place to another. effects are not worth mentioning action was almost not there. they did not know what to make of the monster so he was bad killer one minute softy the next. it was the last few minutes you actually see him or the thing even then i was not impressed. so would not have paid to see this at pictures rather wait for DVD version to see and decide. where it stands it is a one time watch,7,3,8,11 June 2011
Thor," a must see blockbuster movie
","i went to see this on early release date and forked out more to see it in 3d thanks god i did. i just had to find out how far 3d went since Friday 13th 3 in 3d yes it was different but i got to admit my eyes started to hurt after a while and i could not focus on some scenes then i got head ache still from what i have seen effects have dazzled me and i just loved it in 3d it felt real. i will recommended even after a slight head ache. i have rated the film high not because of the dazzling special effects and greatest cgi on film i have to be hones i hate cgi. but i did not minded in this film because there would be no other way of making such movie. i have rated high because of acting and the spirit of the cast just made the film special as it can be. directing of the film was very very good, action just keep coming, script was true to origin of thor and the comic to the last detail and there can be no argument the acting was just great. i loved hopkins as odin i do not know much about the lead actors but thor and loki was just perfect and i mean it as a comic reader. as cinema releases goes this one is a must see in 3d",9,8,16,11 June 2011
Zombieland," worst movie ever
","i have to say i must be the odd one out not liking this movie. i don't know where to start. OK lets try from beginning was there one ?? OK lets start from the middle young guy meets another guy not really hiding or running away from zombies straight away they bond i mean why wouldn't they they might be the last two person on earth no problems there, as soon as they meet two other survivors had to be fit good looking ladies. come on what did you think it was not going to be a guy who just come back from Iraqi war lol. not to give story away not once but few times out witted by girls because last survivors on earth had to be dumb man. then walk in to a zombie trap willing to be rescued by this two dumb idiots. so cut it short script sucked, acting sucked, camera work sucked, directing sucked, even action or woody could not save the film being a biggest zombie disaster movie ever in my eyes. they even brought certain person in to a film to save it from disaster he lasted five minutes and i could see the pain in he's face not wanting to be in this movie. i give this movie a 1 star reason being Woody did he's best trying save the film but failed",1,6,12,11 June 2011
Prometheus," return to alien
",i have to say first of all this film had a lots of borrowed ideas from other sci-fi movies made by mr. Scott and few extras ad in to it. lets start with the cast none stood out more then Rapace and the famous scene next to mirror as Weaver did in almost in every alien movies. never the less there is no one better suited to play the part and Rapace looking hell of a lot sexier then Weaver. i loved the film because it stood of ideas i believed since child GOD did not rest on the seventh day. why stop if you can create and create better as you go alone. only i did not have the money to make it in to such spectacular film and i meant visually. i thanks Ridley Scott for making this a reality. for all those judging the film on the accounts of how the story played i agree on a degree plus all the other actors did not stand out in the film and character development was bad but i think director did not care about all that he wanted people just to observe piece of hes mind thru this movie. Theron could have had a bigger and better part and the twist with the old man could have left out because it gave nothing to the film. having Idris Elba is a plus for me he is a great actor but not getting the roles he deserves typical Hollywood lol. so all in all great visual movie story is not to every ones taste if you are one of those people with little imagination film will leave you with more questions then answers NOT me. i loved the movie i will recommend people to see this on a big screen. i would have given this a 10 stars but only few people stand out in this film as characters so 9 is the best i can do. do to fact visual effects were amazing and story is something every one should think about,9,1,13,24 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," one of the few decent films of 2011
",the film started out really slow then build up to be one of the greatest X- Men film to date. this film is a instant classic for me not because of action or effects because of the superb acting by lead actors and actress's it really felt like going back to the old days and the origins of X-Men. i feel like magneto actually steal the spotlight in the film he felt more real and determined to do the job at hand and that he did in the end. there was nothing left out or miss leading if you are a X-Men fan you will love it even more. i might have given a higher rating because i loved the acting. film is well recommended a must see,9,4,9,11 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," another watchable batman
","i do not know where to start to be honest i feel first batman was just a great movie. it was like eating out from the best restaurant in town even though you know you have no chance of even getting a reservation. then came the second part i thought yea i was entertained it was one of those MacDonald moments. Aaaron Eckhart made the film a pleasant experience. i am sorry i do not agree Heath Ledger acted well in the movie maybe i have a strange taste in acting because it seems most thinks he did. acting did not match the quality of the first. then came this i thought in my heart it was advertised way too much so i got worried it would be another crap like the sucker punch or 300. still went to see it because this film had one of the best actors on planet. only to see this was another MacDonald day i was well disappointed. bane did nothing for me in the movie because i need a face in my fears he had no face there for no acting no facial emotions mask did nothing for me in a short version. film had no thinking moment like the second one just action more explosives more bang which again did nothing for me because i have seen most of these scenes before the film come out. then there was acting and character development acting was average character development was NONE. bale and others did the best they can so no complaints there. in this movie police was clueless not like the second one where they had lot more going for them. then there is the ending which again did nothing for me because it was too easy too quick . i have to say if there is a directors cut to this it might just save it but as it is NO,NO. i rate it 7 like the second one and that is pushing it but when it comes to first one not enough stars here",7,2,6,6 August 2012
Looper," could have been this years hit
","i have to say i was entertained in this movie there was never a dull moment. i read the comments here lots of people did not like the movie due to their expectations was too high, mine was not. there are a lots of loopholes in the movie as the tittle suggests lol. acting was 8 out of 10, one other thing was this was not really a science fiction you got to see the time machine to understand where i am coming from.? i see this movie as no sense action movie. if i have seen this 10-15 years ago i would have given it 9 out of ten as it stands best i can give is 7 out of 10, saying this i still think this movie was thousand times better then surrogate and in time.",7,0,5,6 October 2012
