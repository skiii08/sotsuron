Iron Man 3," More CGI than quality movie...
","'Iron Man 3' is a classic example of what happens when you attempt to make lightning strike in the same place thrice: it doesn't quite work. There have been few casting decisions in the last 20 years of cinema as perfect as the pick of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark (a.k.a Iron Man). Iron Man 3 reminds us of this miracle every time RDJ is on-screen; the billion-dollar franchise depends on him and his great skill at playing this witty, ingenuous billionaire-turned-superhero. The original 'Iron Man' film benefited from a great script that chronicled Tony Stark's transformation into his Iron Man persona. That first film was a smash hit for those 2 reasons: Great script and great lead actor. Now we must subtract the great script for both 'Iron Man 2' and 'Iron Man 3' which leaves only the great actor as a character that we really enjoy. These are mediocre stories compared with the first film, however they are enjoyable due to the action and RDJ's performances. The anticipation for this movie was also amped way up after the incredible 'Avengers' movie, which also benefited from both Downey and an amazing script. That brings us to 'Iron Man 3' which has 'Corporate Meddling' written all over it. I'm not sure exactly why, but highly anticipated blockbusters always tend to be overworked, predictable and drenched in overdone, expensive CGI effects ( Think: Spiderman 3) . Iron Man 3 is such a film with a confused script and a lot of odd ideas for location shooting. By now, Tony Stark has developed his armor in striking ways and with amazing capabilities, so much so that we have little to look forward to in a 4th movie with so many great ideas for the armor crammed into this installment. RDJ keeps us glued to Tony Stark as he carries out an investigation into the terrorist bombings of the Osama Bin Laden-ish villain 'The Mandarin'. The always great Ben Kingsley has a great time with this character and creates a few laughs along the way. Another fine actor, Guy Pierce ( Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo) is completely wasted in his two-dimensional role as mad scientist Aldrich Killian. Many of the sacrifices made by the other actors are simply to make room for Robert Downey Jr. himself. Tony Stark needs a lot of screen time, but the crammed and forced script and plot twists need a lot of screen time also! Mix it all together and it will certainly not match nor suitably follow 'The Avengers' or the original 'Iron Man'. However, there is that cool actor Robert Downey Jr. who seems to miraculously keep us coming back to watch again and again.",Null,2,4,24 August 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great Sequel that shines...
","Spectacular sequel that manages to reproduce the wit and charm of the first film. 'Into Darkness' also hits a great stride with its many exciting sequences that are nicely linked together. JJ Abrams joins Neil Blomkamp as some of today's top sci-fi talent and is certainly the best pick to re-imagine the new Star Wars films. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto step back into Kirk and Spock as if no time at all has elapsed between the two films. These two characters are bound closer together by learning the value of self-sacrifice as well as discipline. The rest of the cast also slides neatly back into place thanks to another great script. Peter Weller is brought in as a star fleet admiral and manages to stand out amongst the other veteran actors. The breakout performance here is Benedict Cumberbatch, moviegoers will be seeing much more of this actor in the future. As the lead villain, Cumberbatch manages to be a commanding presence and an undeniable talent, his work here reminds me of another breakthrough performance decades ago from fellow Brit turned A-list talent, Alan Rickman (Die Hard, 1988). 'Into Darkness' is what sequels should be and another ride through Gene Rodenberry's universe couldn't be much more fun than this.",Null,2,4,24 August 2014
The Aviator," Scorsese Illuminates Hughes' Enigma, Dicaprio Grows...
","This 2004 Howard Hughes biopic stands out amongst the best biographical pictures of the last 10 years. Although not as gritty and intense as Scorsese's greatest film 'Raging Bull' (1980), this picture is well-crafted and sleek. The life and times of the enigmatic Howard Hughes make for compelling subject matter and Socorsese's effort does not disappoint.Those of us Scorsese fans that look upon his work as commercially defiant, and nuanced towards sophisticated viewers have witnessed a gradual, relentless modifying of his technique toward a wider demographic. This evolution of Scorcese's once radical film-making style towards a more commercial, big budget approach is natural and expected given the increasing commercial success of each successive Scorsese film, (not to mention major studio desire to release the next potential Scorsese classic i.e. 'GoodFellas'). These changes in style and presentation are also closely linked to the diverse screenplays and proliferation of new A-list talent (such as Mr. DiCaprio) headlining Scorsese's pictures. Given these considerations, 'The Aviator' still manages to showcase quite a few original Scorsese sequences recalling his raw and intensely personal early films.Howard Hughes was a filmmaker as well as an aviator and it's no surprise that the chaotic production of Hughes first film ,1930's 'Hell's Angels' (which Scorsese clearly admires) is chronicled in detail at the outset of the movie. We witness the continuous nervous energy and persistent drive of Hughes to achieve his daring goals, all the while breaking new ground in aviation, film and big business. This film closely tracks Hughes' personal life as well, his well-publicized affairs with famous starlets of the day such as Katherine Hepburn (played well by Cate Blanchett) are illustrated in-depth with notable performances throughout.Leonardo DiCaprio continues to grow and develop under Scorsese's direction, and the development is phenomenal to witness. Beginning with 'Gangs Of New York' (2002) and continuing beyond this movie (2006's masterful 'The Departed'), DiCaprio's acting chops are sharpening with each performance, eclipsing his previous work and establishing his talent amongst Hollywood's A-List actors. As the Hughes character, DiCaprio is able to captivate and compel us with flashes of OCD symptoms and manic behavior to the extreme, all the while struggling to balance these chaotic forces with his public and managerial personas. A fascinating example of this balancing act occurs when Hughes is confronted with a ruthless public relations attack, designed to coerce him into selling his airline TWA to his commercial competitor, Pan Am (whose chief, Juan Trippe is played by Alec Baldwin). Hughes collects his faculties and battles back with impressive vigor, this after nearly dying in a spectacular crash of his XF-11 spy plane prototype. All of these events unfold beautifully and the rhythm of this film holds our attention despite the nearly 3 hour running time.'The Aviator' holds up well on repeat viewings despite the long running time, it covers the entire first half of Hughe's remarkable life and career, and a second feature could easily be written detailing Hughes' subsequent years in Las Vegas and his premature death. All in all, DiCaprio's growth as an actor cannot be understated, this is a must see performance.",7,1,3,6 April 2007
Watchmen," 20% amazing. 80% crammed together butchery of Moore's classic.
","The filmmakers tried their best, but anyone who read the original comics WAY before this became a screenplay can understand that it was badly butchered, a great deal of unnecessary blood and gore. SERIOUS cuts had to be made for time which badly hurt central, CLASSIC characters' development.I absolutely applaud the effort, it shows real passion for the story and characters. This one-of-a-kind graphic novel and instant classic was never really do-able as a live action film, but no one can blame Snyder and friends for trying! Poorly stitched together, much like Moore's other classic 'V for Vendetta'.",4,3,6,7 March 2009
Elysium," Socialist allegory with a thin veil of Sci-fi...
","'Elysium' is a socialist allegory with a thin cover of sci-fi/action. Neil Blomkamp has created his own version of another left-wing sci-fi movie, namely James Cameron's'Avatar. I mention Cameron specifically because its clear that Mr. Blomkamp could learn a great deal about the creation and unfolding of action sequences and character development from the older sci-fi master. Matt Damon does a great job as the Christ-like Max; a former felon who lives in the Los Angeles of 2154. In this dystopic future, earth is overcrowded and polluted to the extreme and all of the wealthy folks have created a paradise on the titular space station. Jodie Foster's character runs Elysium with an iron fist and routinely has poor people blown up attempting to fly there and gain access to Elysium's life-saving medical technology. That's right: Universal health care is the biggest plot device in this film. There's an undeniable link to the recent uproar over the 1% and economic inequality in general, but Mr. Blomkamp ends up telling a cartoonish, one- sided story. This simplistic tale of greed and privilege ends up suffocating the development of all characters with the exception of Damon's. Mr. Blomkamp does create some good momentum as the action heats up but the fight sequences suffer from poor choreography and a flurry of bad camera work. The film does deliver on an emotional level at the end but we are left with a peculiar feeling that it could have been much better. Having said that, Neil Blomkamp showed enormous promise with 'District 9' and has a bright future ahead of him so long as he takes tips from his contemporaries and continues to grow as a film maker.",Null,0,1,24 August 2014
The Matrix Reloaded," An Exercise In Franchise Annihilation...
","The action sequences are the only reason I rated this film 3 stars. 'Reloaded' turns out to be a whopping disappointment. I caught the midnight preview of this movie and was expecting a satisfying sequel building from the strengths of the first Matrix film, which was an instant sci-fi/action classic. Instead, we were treated to a terribly botched effort. Apparently, the first film was a fluke for the Wachowskis, whose writing and character building skills simply evaporated after the smash success of the first film. Alongside the likewise awful 'Matrix: Revolutions', the once promising team proceeded to demolish the legacy of what could have been the next 'Star Wars Trilogy'. Hence, a potential all-time classic series of Matrix films was not to be. What went wrong?Plenty.For starters, the original characters were not refreshed or developed adequately. We fully expect to see Neo's awesome powers on full display, and here the Wachowskis do not disappoint. However, the Neo character remains virtually the same, his realization that the Oracle's prediction was correct and that he truly is 'The One' failed to boost his confidence or convince him to truly lead his comrades towards victory against the machines ( Imagine Luke Skywalker in 'Return Of The Jedi' still behaving like a whining farm boy). Instead, Neo takes a back seat to Morpheus again. The relationship between Neo and Trinity is still flat, I sensed no on-screen chemistry between the two at any time. The supporting cast have a small degree of development, but it is too little, too late as the movie plods along between killer (if not cliché) action sequences. Central character Agent Smith is altered into a more powerful 'Smith', OK. This classic villain has been ruined by an awful script long on existential rhetoric but short on captivation. The CGI 'Squidies' are badly overdone here as well as in 'Revolutions'. We expect to see more sophisticated and diverse machines introduced, especially in a world of machines such as this. Instead, the squidies are the only muscle the machine empire can produce to combat the Zionites. The program-run-amok characters such as the Merovingian are silly and lame. This movie was a financial blockbuster due mainly to the action sequences, which were superb. It's a shame that the excellent storyline introduced in the first movie was thoroughly trashed beginning with this sequel and continuing into the third and (thankfully) final installment.",3,1,2,21 March 2007
The Departed," An Instant Scorsese Classic, Nicholson Dominates...
","'The Departed' will join director Martin Scorsese's other classic crime dramas, arguably on a par with 'GoodFellas' in particular. This film easily swept the Academy Awards in 2007, winning Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editor and Best Adapted Screenplay. This classic film is set in Boston, where two young police cadets( Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio) are pulled into the web of betrayal and murder orchestrated by Irish crime boss Frank Costello (played by the legendary Jack Nicholson). The complex plot is based on the Hong Kong film 'Internal Affairs'(2002) of which 'The Departed' is a remake. The film is packed with A-list talent; in addition to that mentioned above, the movie also stars Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlberg. The screenplay for 'The Departed' is among the best ever written for a crime drama, it keeps the action moving at a fast clip and delivers clever dialogue alongside fantastic character development. Martin Scorsese won his first Academy award for Best Director for this picture; a well-deserved and long-delayed honor for one of America's greatest directors. It's easy to see why Scorsese won for this film, it is yet another brilliant expose of his masterful skill as a director. Jack Nicholson dominates this film. His performance as crime boss Frank Costello is brilliant and seems to come effortlessly to this living legend of the silver screen. The Costello character is ruthless and Machavellian to say the least, he 'adopts' the young Colin character (Conor Donovan, played as an adult by Matt Damon) who grows up to join the Massachusetts State Police, thereby giving the crime boss an inside man within law enforcement, and the perfect ally to protect and expand his various rackets. From Nicholson's opening line, he outshines the other actors with screen presence alone, and then eclipses them altogether with his classic line deliveries. Leonardo DiCaprio has grown to full maturity as a true A-List actor. His third collaboration with Scorsese (following 2002's 'Gangs Of New York' and 2004's 'Tha Aviator') as police cadet-turned-undercover cop Billy Costigan is perfectly performed, illustrating Scorsese's continued ability to draw out DiCaprio's best interpretations. Matt Damon revisits familiar territory as a South Boston cop, this role recalls his performance in 'Good Will Hunting' complete with authentic Boston accent. Damon also works well under Scorsese, portraying the duplicitous, crooked cop Colin; his performance is sharp and well-balanced. Mark Wahlberg's character Staff Seargent Dingnam is all wit and constant profanity, giving him the majority of the hilarious one-liners and zingers in this film. Martin Sheen provides a perfect counterbalance to Wahlberg's character as Chief Queenan. Providing further evidence of perfect casting is Alec Baldwin, who portrays Lieutenant Ellerby, the most crass and humorous of the veteran officers. Ray Winstone also delivers a superb performance as the menacing, authoritative Mr. French, Costello's most trusted enforcer. The music of The Rolling Stones constantly drones in and out during the film, providing excellent atmosphere for a crime flick set on the mean streets. 'The Departed' is a instant classic, a great movie for fans of gritty, violent crime dramas ala 'The Sopranos'. Scorsese continues to exhibit his mastery for this genre of film, his best work to date.",9,2,5,12 April 2007
Raging Bull," Scorsese and DeNiro's Masterpiece...
","'Raging Bull' stands out as an all-time classic, easily director Martin Scorsese's greatest work. The film chronicles the life and times of 1940's middleweight champion boxer Jake Lamotta. In stark contrast to Sylvester Stallone's 'Rocky', this film is more visceral and even ugly at times. LaMotta's personal demons are exorcised in gritty black-and-white, his struggles and rage are fleshed out with unflinching realism. The performances in this film are so relaxed, the viewer sometimes feels as if he/she is watching a documentary, a black-and-white reality show set in 1940's era Bronx. Frequent improvisation on the part of the actors also contributes to a sense of captured reality. This style of filmmaking has been widely imitated ever since; such realism in film was virtually non-existent at the time 'Raging Bull' came to the screen. Robert DeNiro gives the performance of his career as the iconic LaMotta. His performance earned him the Oscar for Best Actor. As the 'Bronx Bull', DeNiro is tough and passionate. The viewer is drawn to care about this character primarily because of the strong personal connection formed as a result of the realistic, and totally original Scorsese exhibition. Witness the brutal odyssey of a struggling fighter, shot through with flashes of rage and violence. Jake's condition is all too human, his personality illustrated through various conversations and fight sequences. It is an angry and impatient portrayal, Jake simply wants to win, and to do so with his two fists and burning heart. Outside the ring, Jake is restless, impatient and defiant against the rigged establishment that keeps him from getting his title shot. Respect is paramount in Jake's world, any perceived sleight against him is returned with fiery anger. These issues of respect and retribution are instinctive to male viewers; every man can identify with another's struggle for respect and identity, as well as adolescent testosterone flare-ups and territorial immaturity in relationships. All of these essentially male experiences are magnified by Jake's boiling anger, which he unleashes in the ring with nothing short of ferocity. This film avoids clear-cut resolutions. Jake's struggles continue long after his exit from the ring, through physical decline as well as divorce, his peace and happiness remains elusive as he plummets to a variety of lows throughout his retirement. The Mascagni score is passionate and this music provides a steady comfort throughout the peaks of Jake's life, creating an emotional and bittersweet counter-balance to his sad decline. Joe Pesci's portrayal of Jake's brother Joey is also memorable. Joey's own bursts of anger echo those of his brother and Pesci's brilliant performance is a preview of his character Tommy in Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. Cathy Moriarty also shines as Jake's girlfriend (and later wife), Vickie. Scenes between Moriarty and DeNiro reveal genuine, and crucial chemistry between the two. Above all, 'Raging Bull' is a story brought to life by Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker. Alongside film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Scorsese's cuts are imaginative and clever, action in the ring is captured up close and personal and shots are beautifully interchanged to create the right mood for each sequence. As mentioned before, the theme music for this picture is the Intermezzo by Mascagni, a gorgeous Italian piece which accents the bittersweet nostalgia of Jake's career and personal peaks, as well as underlining the sadness of his low points. 'Raging Bull' continues to endure as a classic film as well as a milestone in movie-making. This picture is all heart.",10,1,2,22 March 2007
Looper," Interesting yet lacking...
","'Looper' has all of the potential of an awesome sci-fi film: Time-travel and hit men mixed with a splash of gangster politics. The execution of this concept does suffer in some areas, most notably the make-up used to transform Joseph Gordon-Levitt into a young Bruce Willis (The make-up is extraordinarily bad in many shots ,especially in the lip area, many times appearing too red). The poor make-up detracts from Gordon-Levitt's otherwise great performance. 'Loopers' are hit men that execute mob enemies that have been brought back through time, thereby erasing their future existence completely. The time travel concept is used here in a very similar fashion as it was in 'Twelve Monkeys' (1995) which also starred Bruce Willis. Gordon- Levitt plays a young mob hit-man in the year 2044 who is assigned to kill his future self in order to 'close his loop'. The screenplay is original and exciting however, poor casting choices for many supporting characters brings it down to the level of a mediocre action flick. It's a shame that a great actor like Jeff Daniels is given very little to work with as a two-dimensional mob boss. The standout is Gordon-Levitt himself, he clearly worked hard to capture many of Bruce Willis' subtle idiosyncrasies and mannerisms. Writer-Director Rian Johnson shows promise in this major feature ,but clearly his best work is ahead of him. 'Looper' had the potential to be one of the great new sci-fi films, instead, it leaves you thinking of a dozen ways it could have turned out a heckuva lot better.",Null,0,1,24 August 2014
