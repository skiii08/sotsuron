The Blair Witch Project," Original and Scary ( May contain Spoilers)
","First of all, I recognize the fact that this film has lovers and haters. Some praise it for its realism, believable acting, and very subtle horror. Some denounce it as being an overlong, unbelivable, and altogether stupid idea.I am one of the people who appreciate this film for what it is.The movie begins with a title card stating that in 1994, three amateur filmmakers ventured into the woods to film a documentary about the legend of the 'Blair(the name of the town near the woods) Witch.' The message then goes on to say that the group of filmakers dissapeared and have never been found.What follows is a viewing of the 'footage' they captured  before their dissapearance.The result is a haunting tale filmed with a hanheld camera, disoriented motions, and the grim knowledge that these young adults are marching towards their doom.The Blair Witch Project consists of very realistic acting and  a chilling first person naration through the eyes of the handheld camera. Now, I have seen many horror films that I can only describe as horrible and completly lacking in creativity. Many of them relie on violence and gore to make the audience overlook the terrible acting and very mediocre plot. I literally HATE these films and their filmmakers. However, in Blair Witch, there is no gore or sex, the language in understandable for people in this situation, and the film uses tension and a kind of claustrophobic feeling to frighten its audience.However, this film can be very slow in some parts and I could pick out almost 15 minutes of superfluous screentime. But put aside that, and you have a masterpiece of suspense that are hard to find in horror films today. Perhaps all horror films should be made on a low budget like The Blair Witch Project or Halloween.",Null,0,1,4 April 2004
Se7en," Disturbing,dark,yet also a brilliantly filmed, compelling mystery/suspense
","Many people might be put off by the gruesome and twisted experiance that is director David (Fight Club) Fincher's suspense film. However, if you choose to be more tolerant about the graphic nature of the film, you will find it to be a suspenseful,exhilerating, masterpiece of shadows and thrills.The film revolves around a burnt out cop (Morgan Freeman)and his new, hot shot partner(Brad Pitt) who are investigating a string of very gruesome murders. It soon becomes clear the killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins (Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, Envy, and Wrath) as his motive. The film is shot mostly in rainy, dark locations which intrigued me at first but soon got boring. However, just when you think the film will drop on its rear, it gets interesting again. The acting is a wonder. Morgan Freeman plays the burnt out detective with his usual charm and charisma and Brad Pitt is believable as Freeman's partner up until the last scene, which I felt like he was trying to hard to cry. Kevin Spacey, however, steals the show as the sadistic murderer. He is both terrifying and attractive and portrays pure insanity like no other actor I've ever seen.",Null,0,0,18 March 2004
The Usual Suspects," One of the Great Contemperary Film Noirs
","I will admit that when I first heard the title to this movie I thought is was some kind of comedy. However, I soon heard more about it from friends and magazine articles and decided to watch it.To say that I was pleased would be an understatement, I was blown away. The film has everything I go to the movie to see: a magnificent script (Christopher McQuarrie), top notch acting (particulary Kevin Spacey and Benincio Del Toro, and a last minute surprise twist.The film revolves around a con-man named Verbul Kent who is apparently one of the only survivors of a failed drug bust. Kent is interrogated by a Federal agent (an impressive Chazz Palmenteri)about the events leading up to that incident. What follows is a story told in flashbacks in which Kent and four other men, one of them a ex cop, are brought in for questioning and soon form an alliance with each other. They pull off a successful heist and soon take a job from a man named Redfoot. The easy living soon all goes downhill from there and the men are plunged into a dimension of distrust,conspiracy, and power all of which circle around a mythic criminal.IF you the kind of person who only enjoys truly great films, this is one to see.",Null,1,3,30 April 2004
