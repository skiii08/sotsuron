Catch Me If You Can," It Caught Me
","So this will start by saying, I only bump this up a bit because it's Steven Spielberg. Just the same, because it's a film you wouldn't associate him with outside the acting associations. A great story and casting. And a Spielberg great. Maybe. Just maybe. Based on cast, story, lack of effects, historical relevance (Yes, did you know the premise going in??); perhaps SS's most underrated work. Loved it start to finish myself.",9,0,1,19 December 2018
The Usual Suspects," Unusual
","I love being a movie critic. Few movies stump me. Seriously, I wondered why no one talked directly to Bruce Willis in scene 1 or 2 of M.Night Crap of Film. Thanks first 5 freaking minutes when Bruce shot in the gut. Yes you're dead already. Crying Game was more a secret. I went rewind on Suspects for maybe first time ever, cuz I thought..'I think it was...but was it...really!! Called better plot, characters, direction, acting, etc. than most any suspense thriller could ask. Hitchcock would go thumbs up, but probably on Twitter. I didn't think it was this guy, but not him either. I thought it was Kobayashi myself. Rewind. Unusual suspects.",9,0,2,20 January 2019
Independence Day," LAUGHABLE!!
","Not Caddyshack or Animal House LAUGHABLE. If you film crap, they will come. That's enough space wasted on this drivel.",1,3,9,18 August 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," What coulda been...in Hollywood
","Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood is an enigma of a movie. A bulk of the acting throughout is well done, but what else would you expect from the lineup provided. An opportunity is there for a memorable story. You just never really see one. Had you gone into this movie, well aware of the acting skill-set involved, but with little knowledge of the director's previous work, you'd likely come out saying, 'Not bad, but the director does have potential.' Kinda a summary of the film; has potential. Some of the best acting scenes are of the actors 'acting' within the movie. But they are drawn out. And in the end, have little to do with where the plot is going, which is a task to figure out itself. Many of the driving scenes are lifeless. Where in past Tarantinio works, like Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, that used this venue for witty dialogue and forums into character's minds. In the end Tarantino called this his love story to L.A. And no doubt the way in which 60's Hollywood is displayed is superb. But the story is sluggish. And when it wraps up in old school Tarantino style it's more like there was simply nothing left to tell. Problem being, not much had been told to us until then. In past Tarantino efforts you end up sorting through several scenes and sequences to pick out your favorites and most memorable. In ...Hollywood, you seem left still searching.",4,2,6,28 March 2020
Get Out," Get 'T F' Out
","Wow. I can summarize this film without any reference to racism, original horror, creative writing, etc. by saying it's simply another version of Hollywood over-hype. How the public takes this below average crap and runs with it is beyond me. I can imagine with the Unreal deluge of sequels, trilogy, and remakes that original writing is at a premium. But it doesn't mean you have to settle for nonsense and label it an achievement. Go back and watch your favorite horror movie again for the 13th time. Don't waste a 1st on the over-hyped.",2,1,4,19 November 2018
The Game," A gamey ending. But solid all around
","I must admit it was hard not to be enthralled with The Game. Well written with solid acting choices, The Game gives you the basic plot setup from the start, without ever really letting on to exactly where it's going. It may seem slow to start on first viewing, but when it starts rolling, like our main character, you're rolling right with it. It's one of few movies where you feel you just might not have a grip on where it stands. The only setback is the somewhat implausible ending. Scratch that. Very implausible. They could have had filthy-rich Nick Van Orton win the Powerball instead. The odds may have been better that the odds of pulling off the climactic finish and or 'stunt' in the grand finale. But as Steven Spielberg once said of an implausible ending to Jaws, 'I had the audience glued this far, I could probably end it any way I wanted.' Same here. But if you shake your head in disbelief in the last few minutes, you still won't regret the first 120 or so that take you on a puzzling, fun ride.",8,0,0,3 August 2019
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Oscar
","Woman goes fishing. Never leaves. Makes an erotic, lustful career of it. This film has some perks. A decent acting ensemble. Michael Shannon, for one, delivers a character very easy to find despicable. But in all it's just hard to take for a best picture winner. Many find virtue in this film from its themes of prejudice. But Hollywood could have found similar themes in a film like Three Billboards; and Frances Mcdormand didn't even have to sleep with a carp. Oscar season is a real coin flip anymore for the Big prize.",3,3,10,3 November 2018
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Rank Anchor
","The age old plea of the desperately defensive is, 'If you know it's a movie with stupid humor going in, you should expect it to be stupid.' But in the end it still is classified a comedy and a comedy should make you laugh. I think I caught myself chuckle 4 or 5 times watching this. Not a great ratio for 90+ minutes of wasted breath in your life. It's even harder to digest when the actors appear to think what they're doing is actually funny. Just a waste of time for a movie.",1,2,4,1 July 2019
Jaws," Take A Big BITE!!!!!
","As If no one has seen this. But it's the ultimate classic. I was 7 when I saw it in the theater. And it stands out to this day. Perhaps it's the CGI day of film that makes it even better today. A modern remake would be the worst decision in movie history. It's why you make The Meg instead. The 1st summer blockbuster.
Introducing Steve. No one wore One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest T shirts. And don't forget that mechanical shark. Think of that shark NOT working and a crack staff of writers having to dig deeper into a plot and story instead. Today a 6 year old on a PC would fix it in 2 minutes. Great actors. Well acted. Was it not the perfect storm. You can say a lot about movies that boast great significance, Jaws may be the ONLY one that stretches that significance to so many parameters. To the person who couldn't give it a 12. Yeah. 15 doesn't work either.",10,0,1,22 November 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Mr. Darabont ?? I'll pay more!!
","This may be decades behind. But after watching this for the 159th time on a censored station, is this the greatest movie ever, period, as well as the one movie you beg for just 5 more minutes of screen. The fade out from the oceanside was perfect. Yet Frank. Just show them playing chess on the boat. Not sure bout all the pieces. Who cares. We would cry with every chess move and surely every drink to freedom. But sure that's what happened anyway.",10,0,0,19 January 2019
Green Book," Maybe
",Haven't seen this movie. But Oscar gave Get Out a statue like it was selling girl scout cookies. Well done Green Book.,9,0,2,20 January 2019
Goodfellas," This is SO easy.....
",".....How many Oscars should Scorsese have? This is the one that got away. As much as Raging Bull was a slap, this is where the famous 'He finally deserves it' should have crept in. His best work. From a genius. I like to think Marty sees 10 or 12 pics wrapped up in that The Departed oscar. Well deserved as well, but here's a guy who should have a long mantle. Goodfellas is the One that missed. Although I could watch, actual winner, Dancing With Wolves 10X more than Ordinary People, which knocked out Raging Bull. Really Marty?? Hear Ya!!!!!",10,0,0,22 November 2018
