First Man," It's Fantastic
","Breathtaking. That's probably the best way to describe the last third of this film. But it's not just the last third that's good. The entire film is very, very good. With First Man as well as Damian Chazelle's last two films, he's quickly becoming my favourite director and deservedly so.Let's start by talking about the aforementioned last third. It is one of the most intense experiences I have ever had while watching a movie. Hell, it's one of the most intense experiences I've ever had. Everything from the music to the way it was filmed just puts you right on the edge of your seat. Even though you know what happens, it's just so incredibly well made that you can't help but feel anxious. And without spoiling anything once they land on the moon the change in tone and feeling is just beautiful. And then there is the ending which is, like everything else, just so beautifully made.Then let's talk about the first two thirds. First Man is certainly more of a biopic of Neil Armstrong than it is a movie about the moon landing. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to you but I certainly found it to work very well. Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong is excellent and other performances shine just as brightly. However, it almost feels like the last third is a completely different movie. In fact, everything before it could've been a documentary about Armstrong before he landed on the moon.I actually find it quite hard to write about this film. It's without a doubt one of the best films of the year and if I wasn't such a big Marvel fan, this would certainly my favourite film of the year so far. I can't think of anything that could've been improved or done differently. I highly, highly recommend seeing First Man even if you don't care about the subject. It really is that good.",9,0,2,17 October 2018
A Star Is Born," It's Great
","There's nothing special about it but there's really nothing wrong with it either. Overall A Star Is Born is a great film and a very nice directorial debut from Bradley Cooper.I basically walked into the theater hoping for some good music and decent film. The music was fantastic and the movie itself was also surprisingly good. Cooper not only does a good job at directing but his singing was certainly a pleasant surprise and as far as acting goes, this could very well be one of his best performances ever. Lady Gaga, as one would expect, absolutely kills all the music performances she does but her acting was also fairly good. What I liked most about it, was how natural it felt.Then I want to briefly touch on the structure of the film because there is a very significant shift in tone about midway. The first half is mostly fun and I couldn't help but smile on multiple occasions. It celebrates the story between the two main characters as well as the music. However, come the second half, the film becomes much more grim and serious. While this is quite clichÃ©, it works and sets the tone for the ending.As I said earlier, there is nothing special about A Star Is Born. It is exactly how you would expect it to be but it manages to do everything well. Strong performances and the brilliant soundtrack are definitely the highlights. Whether or not this will win any Oscars, which is what it's trying to do, remains to be seen, but it is most certainly a great film.",8,2,3,19 October 2018
Thirteen Days," It's Good
","Having an interest in this period of time I was excited to learn about Thirteen Days. Indeed, I had never heard of it before and seeing the cast I have to say that I was a little surprised. However, now having seen it, I'm glad I stumbled across this film. While it's not amazing it is certainly very well made and represents the graveness of the situation brilliantly.The most impressive thing was how reasonably Donaldson handled showing the Cuban missile crisis and the US politics surrounding it. I think that it would be rather easy to let things get completely out of hand and thus the movie would end being mostly a mess. Either you make it action oriented or focus completely on politics. Donaldson did the latter and made it work. While most of the movie is people sitting in rooms talking - as one can imagine - there are also small action sequences sprinkled in which add some excitement, keeping the film always flowing. Perhaps it was thanks to the rather excellent cast or the great writing but the talking never gets boring. In fact, I wouldn't have minded seeing more of it.Now, having said what I said in the last paragraph one might imagine me giving Thirteen Days a higher rating. This brings me to my biggest flaw in the film. There is just something unexplainable missing. I can't figure out what it is but I just felt like there was always something missing. Had it not been for that, I think that this could easily be one of the best political movies out there. There are no flaws and everything that this film does, it does very well. I just felt like I was wanting something more for almost the entire runtime.Thirteen Days is definitely a good film and if you are interested in the Cold War or how Kennedy and co handled it, I would highly recommend seeing it. However, I feel that everyone else might be left somewhat bored and wanting for more. Perhaps that is what I was missing. This film is as political as it gets and maybe I just wanted it to be a bit more. With that being said, I enjoyed it and certainly learned some things.",7,0,0,17 October 2018
Annihilation," Wished for More
","I really wanted to like this film because the concept seemed fascinating and Alex Garland's previous film was excellent. However, I was sadly quite disappointed. I just felt like every aspect was very tame and somewhat lacking.With a film like this, much more could've been done. Everything could've been dialed up to ten and the film would've only gained from that. When there are scenes that are supposed to be scary, I didn't feel scared. When I was supposed to be on edge, I felt only somewhat tense. Had these scenes truly been what they were trying to be, I feel that Annihilation would've been hands down one of the best sci-fi films of the year. I'm actually quite frustrated with that. I found Ex Machina to be very good in these aspects and I'm left wondering what happened with Garland.It's not all bad though. First of all, this film looks absolutely stunning. Once the group enters 'the Shimmer', the world becomes interesting, beautiful, full of detail and most importantly it left you wanting for more. It was filled with curious and rather frightening creatures and gorgeous and peculiar plants.
Second of all, I have to give credit to the last third of the film. I finally felt like the film was giving me what I had wanted from it from the very beginning. The last 30 minutes were tense and scary. It felt almost like Garland had remembered how to create tension.All in all, I think that Annihilation is a decent sci-fi film. It is certainly different from what most sci-fi films nowadays tend to be. It offers a unique look at us humans and gives us one of the most intriguing fictional worlds in a long time. Sadly, it just felt quite muted. Had it been more tense and scary, I feel that this would've possibly been one the best films of the year.",7,0,0,9 October 2018
