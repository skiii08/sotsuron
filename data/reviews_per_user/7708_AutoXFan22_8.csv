Mission: Impossible III," 1>3>2
","OK, so having seen all three Mission: Impossible movies now, I can say that the first was still the best, the second faltered big time, and the third was really not all that bad. Certainly it ran a little slowly at times, but Hollywood works that way. The whole love story was a little odd, but makes sense. You work in intelligence/black ops, and you're not going to want anyone to know what you do either, both for their protection and yours. Need proof of that, research the history of CIA defectors.As for the plot, this one was pretty decent. The casting helped it out quite a bit. The guys who are supposed to be funny are funny, the ones who are supposed to be serious are very serious, and I didn't really find that any character just didn't fit. To be honest, the only reason I gave this movie an 8/10 is that it still didn't quite live up to the original. Otherwise, it was pretty good. Worth seeing, especially if you're in for a good action flick with a decent plot.",8,2,4,11 May 2006
Spider-Man 2," Amazing
","I heard from my brother that this movie was supposed to be amazing, but wasn't sure.  That is, until I finally saw it last night.  I'm convinced that this was the step required for the Spider-Man legacy to reach a pinnacle.  Spider-Man was pretty damn good, casted well, scripted properly, and was fairly impressive.  Spider-Man 2 blew the original away without a doubt.  Of course there were some very odd parts.  For example, the park scene where Parker is just walking around.  That just didn't make much sense, didn't fit in with everything else.  And the whole elevator scene? As insanely funny as that was, it just didn't seem like something I would've wanted to put in a movie of this caliber.  Minus those few parts, this movie was unbelievable.",10,0,0,10 July 2004
The Aviator," A new standard
","Very much wow! Yes, it may have been fairly long, but this movie was very worth seeing. Stylistically, this was clearly a Scorsese film. It was edgy, interesting, and had a good flow to it.The casting was above par for a film of this magnitude, and all the characters were very believable, especially Leo's character of Howard Hughes. I hate to say it because I don't like him much as an actor, but I think this is bound to be the real pinnacle of his career. Titanic started the downhill slide, and this movie put him back on the charts.As for accuracy, this movie did it right in all regards, especially with regards to Hughes and how completely insane he was.Definitely worth 'best of the year' at the Oscars.",10,0,0,13 February 2005
Collateral," Very good movie
","Without going into too much detail, this movie kept me guessing all the way. Lots of twists and turns I didn't expect.I still can't quite take Tom Cruise seriously as a hit-man, but I'll learn to accept it eventually, because he did a pretty darn good job of playing the ultimate cold-blooded ****. I don't know what it is, but he just plays a role like this so naturally, it's almost scary. I guess it's a testament to his skill as a actor.Jamie Foxx, though I don't like him in general, did a decent job as a flustered cab driver trying to make it through his night in one piece. In a way, I think Foxx is the perfect compliment to an anti-hero like Vincent the hit-man.Anyway, real good movie, very well made.",9,0,1,12 March 2005
Batman Begins," Excellent movie, minus small plot holes
","OK, first off, excellent movie. Absolutely perfectly cast, well-made, riveting, and genuinely exciting. I think this is by far the best Batman movie ever made. Christian Bale plays the perfect Bruce Wayne. Obviously, Bruce Wayne is supposed to be this dark and dramatic figure, someone that can't really be understood all that well. Christian Bale appears to fit that mold seamlessly. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, supporting the story in a valuable way.Now for the bad news. Without giving a thing away and letting the true fans decipher for themselves, there were a few small plot holes. As I said, no spoilers, but the little plot holes were a little bit annoying. Not enough to bring it down a notch, but enough to make me think a little bit.",10,0,0,25 June 2005
Black Hawk Down," Great
","Great movie, that's all I have to say.  Truly shows the horror of war better than I ever thought possible.  Casting was good, filming was good, and the true nature of the catastrophe was caught in the film.  The best character in my opinion was 'Hoot', played by Eric Bana.  He's one of those characters that never gives up, and I truly admire that.Terrific movie, another great job by Ridley Scott.",10,0,0,28 April 2003
The Last Samurai," Impressive
","The quality of this movie is unlike anything I've ever seen.  It grabbed me emotionally, visually, musically, and didn't let go until the last possible second.  The intro with the trade fair was kind of quirky, but I guess it worked.  The rest of the movie though was nearly flawless.  I've been a fan of Tom Cruise for years, and I would honestly say that this has been his best role to date.  Most believable character he's ever played by far.  Ken Watanabe was brilliant.  Sometimes a little hard to understand, but that comes with the territory I think.  Again, musical quality was amazing, very fitting with the environment in which this movie takes place.  Kudos to the producers and directors for making this a remarkably impressive film.",10,1,2,8 May 2004
Apollo 13," Definitely makes the cut
","Definitely a great movie.  Lots of action, pretty historically accurate, and very well casted.  Takes alot to make a film this good.  I can't think of many better movies.  I'll say one thing too, the music is unbelieveable, mind-blowing, incredible!  And as for the mix of drama with comic relief, it does a good job of not making light of the situation, but showing the strain on people like those in Mission Control might have actually reacted to it. Pretty amazing movie overall.",9,0,1,11 January 2003
