The Rock," great action movie with a great cast!!!
","This movie is a great action movie. The plot is ex-miltary have stolen some missles armed with some very lethal gas. Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery have to stop Ed Harris from destroying the Bay Area. The U.S government sends in a team of Navy Seals to eliminate the threat of the missles. Eventually it justs boils down to Cage and Connery to save the day!!This movie is a very fast movie . It is never slow or boring!!This movie is one of my all time summer movie blockbuster favorites. I can watch this over and over again !This movie also stars Danny Nucci (Titanic) and Clare (girl from Meet Joe Black/Mystery Men) . Micheal Beihn also co stars along with David Morse and Rex Linn (as FBI agents) . Biehn is a Navy Seal commander who goes to 'The Rock' to stop the bad miltary commandos. The Rock may be a long movie(over 2 1/2 hours) but is a rare movie with a great cast , loads of action and room for a sequel maybe?",10,1,1,28 September 1999
The Blair Witch Project," watch only if you like to people argue and a semi-scary movie!!!
","This overhyped movie is a about of student filmmakers who are filming a movie on the 'Blair Witch'. They interview the local townspeople, visit the graveyard and head for the woods where the 'Blair Witch ' suposedly haunts to this day. They hike around  for a while, then get lost . To make matters worse, one of the group disappears strangely. They find a house and it that about it!!If you movie , with bad camera angles, or hand held camera, you might like this movie!!But is not scary and it just a trip into the woods gone awry!!!!Avoid this movie , it sucked big time!!!!I rented it  hoping to be scary instead I was actually waiting for the cast's tirade to end so I could put my review on the database!!!",1,2,3,21 October 1999
Fight Club," If you liked 'The Game' , you will like 'Fight Club'!!!
","This movie is about a white collar worker, his friend and their club 'Fight Club'. The movie is a little slow at first , but the pace gradually picks up. The club is just a front for other trouble making activities by the people in the club. The movie is kinda like 'The Game' , but it takes a while to explain things out!The cast is great as everyone was cast just right!Brad Pitt is great(not one of my favorite actors!)as Norton's crazy friend!This movie is one wild ride from the director of 'The Game'!Check out this one in theater before it goes to video/DVD!!!I wonder if the director delated any scenes from the movie?maybe the DVD will have some as most do nowadays!!So remember see 'Fight Club' in theater!!Kudos to Fox and the cast !!This movie is awesome!!!I love this movie , it is one of my favorites of 1999!!It is about 2 1/2 hours , but is better than Harrison Ford's 'Random Hearts' which is almost the same running time!!!It's also not as boring as 'Random Hearts'!!!I did fall asleep at the movies for a change!!So once again , Go see 'Fight Club'!!!!",10,0,1,16 October 1999
Batman Returns," As dark as the orginal Batman !!!
","This sequel is as dark as the original Batman movie (also directed by Tim Burton). But this time Bruce Wayne/Batman must face two villians at once!!The first is the Catman(Michelle Pfeiffer) and the Penguin(Danny DeVito), they are great in their roles for this movie!!The movie also throws in a third villian to power play the Penguin, he is played by a very over the top Christopher Walken!!The main plot is that the penguin wants to take over Gotham City and the Catwomen aids in his quest for power. This sequel takes place during Christmas so if you are sick and tried of all those Christmas movies'jingle all the way''it's a wonderful life'(classic) you can get some christmas cheer and some action from Micheal Keaton as well!!The city is dark in this movie as some spots, but hey it's a great action movie!!It's worth the time to check out this dark sequel!!!It's fun for everyone to watch!!!Do yourself a favor and watch this ASAP!!!",7,0,0,27 December 1999
That Thing You Do!," Great time with first time director Tom Hanks!!!great for families!!~~
","This movie is about a group of young men and their song'That Thing You Do!'. The movie takes place in the midwest. The band plays the song at band contest. They win that contest.Eventually after doing other gigs for other people they are discovered by a Mr.White(Tom Hanks). From here on in, the movie shows them on promotional tours of the song. The band decides to the call the band'the Wonders'. Of course they encounter many problems from both within the band, and the fans. This movie features many of today hottest stars in a great movie.Some of them are Tom Everett Scott(One True Thing),Steve Zahn(Out of Sight,Forces of Nature), Charilze Thereon(Mighty Joe Young) and Lili Taylor(Armeggedon). This movie is a nice clean movie that shows us want goes on when a band is hot and the problems that they face!!The sound track is almost a trip back to the 1950's.This movie is awesome movie even if you cannot stand the setting or the stars!!Both Hanks and the cast should of been praised for this movie!!Fox did a great job with this movie!!Kudos to everyone involved!!This movie should be in every movie fans collection!!!This movie is great for families,there is no swearing ,nudity ,violence etc..!!",10,0,0,28 September 1999
X-Men," The Animated series on Fox is better than this rehashed movie!I hear a sequel is in the works!Oh no!
","The X-men is is OK if you like seeing Hollywood trash everything in the animates series and comics(I watch the animates series on FOX). The storyline was lame, the acting wooden and it seemed to remind of several comics turned movies like 'Blade','Judge Dredd','The Phantom',Superman 1,2,3,4' and 'Batman 1,2,3,4'. If you have seen any if these movies this movie is basically any comic book turned into a big screen movie for it's fans! The special effects were at times . They could of done a better a job. As for the people in the X-men movie where the following X-men; Beast,Jubille and Gambit?I hear the cast is supposed to make two or more sequels(bet they have a contract and have to make them!!) Let's see if maybe the indie movie market can make a better movie off a comic book rather than mainstream Hollywood! If you want to see this movie fine,It just belong in the same caterogy as 'Gone With The Wind'. It aint no classic !More like a B-grade comic movie done over and over again!I bet this movie will on video/DVD by Christmas 2000!I can only hope the DVD has more stuff (like delated parts) than in the theater run!",3,1,2,20 August 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Better than the classic Disney animated short!!!
","This movie is a update of the classic story. But in this movie, Crane is a cop sent to Sleepy Hollow to solve some unsolved murders. Crane moves in with the Van Tassell while working on the case. Eventually headless bodies start appearing and the horror of the 'headless horseman' come out. The story of how he lost his head is shown in a flashback.The horseman is played by Christpher Walken(Blast from the Past). The costumes are excellent as the setting.It seems that everyone in Sleepy Hollow is related to each other. Crane eventually discovers who is controlling the horseman. The cast is great as you can never tell who is friend or foe. This movie is better than the classic Disney animated short as it gaves us time to deal with life in Sleepy Hollow, it's people and it's deadly secrets!!!If you like Johnny Depp,Christina Ricci or the other cast you might like this dark take on the classic story!!Or if you like any of Tim Burtons other movies check out his take on the classic horror story!!BTW, the town of Sleepy Hollow does really exist in reality!!!Go see this movie and have  a fun time!!Forget the critics who hate this movie!!At least it's better than Disney's short !!!!",7,0,0,19 November 1999
Scary Movie 2," Tasteless movie, OK spoofs Avoid at all costs!!
","This movie is a tasteless sequel made just because the first movie made over $100 million at the box office last year. It spoofs many popular movies  . There also any many sexual jokes, anti -gay jokes etc, This movie should of been rated NC-17 and never made. I noticed the movie was good at the beginning when it spoofed the 'The Exorist'. After that spoof it all falls downhill as it spoofs 'Hollow Man', 'What Lies Beneath' and the storyline of the 1999 remake of 'The Haunting'. This movie should be avoided at all costs! It stinks and is pure trash! Avoid at all costs if you can! If this what kind of humor Hollywood today  likes toilet bowl humor, then I might as well forget seeing today's comedies. I wonder if 'American Pie 2' will be as bad as this sequel?This movie left a bad taste in my mouth and to think I helped with it box office!Shame on you Disney for making this trash!! Please do not make a third(unneeded) sequel to this movie!",1,0,1,23 July 2001
"Monsters, Inc."," A cute story about life inside our closets with Monsters!
","This movie tells the story of two monsters who accidently let a little human girl into their world inside our  closets. The two monsters must find a way to get her home. Along the way, the human girl becomes friends with these two monsters. Eventually word spreads though out the monster world to find the human girl at all costs. Since it's a Disney movie it has a happy ending. The bad guys get what they had coming to them. The monster world is saved and a new power source is found to power their world.",8,0,1,8 December 2001
Footloose," Great musical of the 1980's!!
","This drama/musical tells the story of young man who moves into a very religious community . The young man is played by Kevin Bacon. He finds out that the local preacher does not allow any music, dancing , fun in his town. Eventually with the help of some friends, he manages to talk the citizens to allow the teens to have a dance. This movie also stars John Lithgow from 3rd Rock from the Sun!!Footloose has awesome sound track , is full of great songs!!!This is one great musical along with Grease in the 1970's!!",7,15,26,30 September 1999
Pearl Harbor," 'Titanic' set during the time of Pearl Harbor,been there,done that!
","This movie is basically 'Titanic' recycled set during the time of the Pearl Harbor attack. It's from the director 'Armeggedon' and 'The Rock'.So it's basically a 'popcorn movie' which means very thin story/plot and special effects overkills.I will get into this movie as I'm sure others here have done enough reviews to cover this film. The story feels like a made for TV movie. It's running time is over 3 hours, so if you need to go the restroom,you did not miss much. The best part of the movie is the attack of Pearl Harbor. What I do not get is if 'Saving Private Ryan''s opening battle scene that last 20 minutes ,made it a 'R' how could almost a hour of war make this movie 'PG-13'?Wait for this at the cheap movie theater or the DVD and jump to the battle and avoid the rest of this movie!If you want to see 'Titanic' recycled fine, you were warned it's a long 3 hours!! Otherwise wait for this movie on DVD or the cheap movie theater!!It's also good if you want to take a nap at the movie theater!!ZZZZZZ!",1,0,1,23 July 2001
Die Hard 2," Great action movie sequel!!!directed by the same person as'Thomas Crown Affair'1999!!
","This sequel takes place in Washington D.C's airport. John Mclane is waitng to pick up his wife from a flight arriving there. Little does he , that a elite group of ex-miltary commandos have seized control of the airport. They have taken control so that can rescue a powerful world figure. The airport staff and Mclane do everthing they can to save the plane over the airport. Eventually, the a special miltary is called in to help stop the miltary terrorists. But nobody is who they are and even they play a special part in the war over the airport. It has some great action sequences as some awesome special effects. If you liked the movie, 'The Thomas Crown Affair' which was directed by the same man you might like this movie!!also if you like Bruce Willis in his action moives , you'll might like this movie!!This movie was followed up by a sequel in summer 1995!!!",8,0,2,27 December 1999
Event Horizon," A great haunted house in outer space!!rent this movie!!
","This movie takes place in the future.A lost spaceship has returned back to our space. The creator of the ship and salvage crew go to find out why it was gone for several years. They have several scary moments. If you liked the original 'haunting'(not the 1999 one!) , you will love this scary haunted house in space!!!my favorite person in the cast is Sam Neil (Jurassic Park) as the ships creator and madman!!!He goes insane in this movie !!If you like hin , also check him out in 'In the Mouth Of Madness' !He also go mad in that too!!Event horizon is a very scary movie that will give anyone nightmares about old buildings or houses, anywhere!!So go rent this awesome haunted house in space movie !!it's great!!!",Null,0,0,14 October 1999
Toy Story 2," As orginal as the first 'Toy Story'!!!!
","This sequel continues the adventures of the toys in Andy's bedroom. Woody gets accidently taken away by a evil toy collector . It is up to Buzz Lightyear and the other toys to save him. To do this they must travel though the dangerous of streets,a toy story, the building where the collector lives and the perils of a very busy airport!!After Woody arrives at the home of the collector, he learns of the past of the toy and the stuff that went with the toy!!He also meets a old man , a young woman and a horse. They were also part of the fad of' Woody's Round-Up'. Eventually the toys get to Woody after having a series of misadventures in the toy store owned by the collctor. Everybody goes home in the end and the collector and the evil toys get their rewards. This movie should of been rated at least a 'PG' or 'PG-13' for violence, sexual references to sex and a couple of semi nude spots!!Just because it's Disney does not automatically mean it rated 'G'!!But if you like the characters or the animation you will like this sequel!!look for spoofs on 'Jurassic Park' and the 'Star Wars' movies!!!It maybe a feature film but it sure felt long for a animated feature!!!Also if you are fans of Tom Hanks and cannot wait for 'The Green Mile' on December 10th to come out see this movie!!If you are  die hard Tim Allen and cannot wait for 'Galaxy Quest' on Chirstmas go check out his return as Buzz Lightyear!!!Go have some fun with awesome animated feature from the folks at Pixar!!!Remember it as original as the first 'Toy Story' in 1995!!!!",9,0,1,26 November 1999
From Hell," Creepy!Very Dark! Scary!
",This movie was very creepy. I wish it could of been a little longer. Overall one of this year's  best scary movies!  The movie was very scary to watch. I wish we could gotten to know the girls who the ripper kills a little more. it's still a very scary movie though!Very creepy and dark!,7,0,1,4 November 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," it was boring!!!summer dud,bomb,stinker,flop!!
","this movie was so slow ,long and boring that I left the theater!!It is fine for fans of the director,but to the average person it was dull.Do not see this unless you have too!!there are better movie it there!!it also looked like it filmed in the 1970's,anybody what's up with that!!??save your movie for a better movie!!These are my comments regarding this overhyped summer blockbuster,or shall I say flop,dud,bomb,stinker!!get the message!!only see if you like the stars and or the director!!",2,1,2,24 September 1999
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Special effects take over and it has a very small plot!Wait for it on DVD/Videotape!
","Well today, I finally caved in and saw this movie. For starters I'm sick and tired about 'Harry Potter'. What I saw was just as I was expecting for a very big hyped movie. The movie itself had a very small plot(mainly Harry's first year at special school for wizards) and a small subplot about a special stone. This acting at times seems very wooden from both the actors, the extras etc. There is special effects overkill in this movie.
The running time is a little over 2 1/2 hours. This movies moves very slowly a lot of the time. Even when they have special effects it seems like it's a too long of a movie. I liked the adult actors, but I hope the child actors playing Harry Potter etc do not get typecast as they could if they play their roles until they are grown up. I also wondered if parts of this movie were left out on the cutting room floor.I say if you are die hard fan of the series, see this movie, But if you are causal fan or just sick and tired of the whole 'Harry Potter' thing wait for it on DVD/videotape.",5,0,1,8 December 2001
A Beautiful Mind," A wonderful biopic about John Forbes Nash,Jr and his life's problems to the Nobel Prize
","I guess I'm one of the lucky people who have seen this movie before it gets a wide release. This movie is a biopic of math prodigy John Forbes Nash,Jr and many of his problems in life.When we first meet John(played by the awesome Russell Crowe) he is a student a Princeton. John makes a few friends at the school. But John's problems are about to increase in his life big time. John graduates from Princeton and moves on to bigger things.A few years later( the mid-1950's) John is working for the Dept. of Defense at MIT. John is recruited by a strange man in black to decode stuff for the government. John meets a beatuful woman who understands him.After John and Alicia(jennifer Connelly) get married, John's life seems pretty normal. But their married problems do not get any better.Eventually John ends up in a mental hospital for his schizophrenia. John gets the medicine he needs to get better. But John is still seeing people and talking to people who do not exist. Eventaully John Nash wins his Nobel Prize in 1994. There's lots more but I've already said enough.This movie has Oscar written all over it. The cast should gets Oscar nominations for thier work.Ron Howard finally made a movie far better than his last movie(How the Grinch Stole Christmas). I hope this movie gets awards as it a very well done film about a real life person,
If you are sick and tired of all the typical mainstream trash out there, check out this wonderful biopic. It's about 2 1/2 hours but it goes by quite fast. This movie was better than the movie trailers before it! If not check it out when it comes out on DVD!",10,0,2,30 December 2001
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A fun sequel!!!Great special effects!!!!Thrilling sequel!!!
","This seqeul has Bruce Willis reprise his role as New York cop John Mclane. But this time he must stop a terrorist from his past. To do this he and Samual L. Jackson must play a deadly game of cat and mouse thoughout New York city area. To make matters worse, the same terrorist has planted a bomb somewhere in the cities many public schools. This sequel has lots of explosions,action,comedy and suspense!!!Jermey Irons(The lion king) also co-stars in thrilling action sequel of this very successful movie franchise!!!If you like the first or second 'die hard' movies , you might enjoy this fun sequel!!It's my favorite of the series, followed by the second movie 'Die Hard 2:Die Harder'.

Con Air," Fun summer action movie!!loads of action and fun !!awesome movie!!great cast!!Awesome soundtrack!!
","This movie stars Nicholas Cage as parolee going home on a plane .But the plane get high jacked by the convicts. The leader is a madman. The convict try to fly away to freedom. Cage is Poe, who is just being released after murdering a man in self defense. But the  FBI know of the plane and of Poe. They attempt to talk the convicts to land the plane.But their talks are all in vain!!The FBI still have to find a way to land the plane without harming innocent people!! This movie is fast action movie, a great cast and a cool sets. I like this movie because it shows the prison from where I live across from. It is called California Medical (CMF). The filmakers named something else. It was a great action movie ,full of fun , suspense . The soundtrack is awesome too. Everyone involved in the movie did a awesome job!!Kudos to the stars !!:)",8,0,0,28 September 1999
The Green Mile," Should get some possible nominations next year!!!great acting/actors!
","This movie should get some Oscar nominations next year. I love this movie, the cast is great as the story!!Some of my favorite actor star in this movie. There are Tom Hanks,David Morse, Bonnie Hunt, James Cromwell ,Micheal Jeter and Gary Sinise. I would actually write my review of this movie as I cannot really say how touching this movie is. It should get some notice because it's not the usual hollywood movie. It is a horror,comedy and drama(heavy) movie. Be sure to bring some tissues for the ending!!The only problem is there delated scenes left on the cutting room floor?I hope this movie gets nominated for some Oscars next year as it's my favorite of the 1999 fall season!!!",10,0,1,24 December 1999
Back to the Future Part II," Great sequel in the series!!!
","The second sequel in the Back to the Future movies  is cool. This time , the Doc and Marty McFly must go forward in time to avert a family mess. They then return to the present day Hill Valley. But is not the Hill Valley they remember! They discover, they must go back in time to repair the present. !!If you like cool special effects and  science ficton , you will like this movie !!It is a great sequel in the series!!One of the few sequels that has withstood the test of time!!It is one of the best in the whole series!!You can also see Elijah Wood(Deep Impact, The Faculty) as a kid the future playing video games!!!",6,1,2,30 September 1999
Any Given Sunday," Too long and it could of been shorter!!!great cast although!!!
","This movie along with the Green Mile(which was worth the 3 hours) ,The Talented Mr.Ripley and The Insider are now part of Hollywood's oscar fall season. The movie is about the problems a fictional football team faces both on and off the field. Any Given Sunday will do well with football fans, but for non-sports people the game sequences will get rather annoying. I would of eliminated some of these sequences are it feels like padding to the story. The director(Oliver Stone) should of clipped off the movie to a least 2 hours or 2 1/2 hours!!If it was shorter perhaps I would be nicer in my review!Also Stone appears too much as newscaster during the games(stone if you must appear in your movies do it for 5 minutes and get back to shorting )this elongated football movie!!!Normally I avoid the director's movie but because the trailers made the movie look like a decent sports flick. For anybody deciding to go see this movie , be prepared for a way too long movie and a sore butt after this very,very long movie!!It's decent for a matinee , but only see it if you will fall asleep as it's one of the worst movies in running time!!Other than the cast is great and so the story , it just should of been shorter!!!",3,0,0,24 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," a review after the hype!!!what sixth sense?!
","This movie deals with the problems a young teenager has. He starts to see Willis(a shrink again) . Willis and the young boy eventually discover that he sees dead people. The movie is  like  mini ghost stories. We see him meet ghosts all over the place,which to me should of been one ghost only. With all these ghosts running around ,it hard to figure out a  plot to this.  The ending was not what I was expected. This movie was OK to say the least.At least we get a great performance from the cast!!!",6,0,0,28 September 1999
A Night at the Roxbury," great fun and a great sound track!!
","This movie is about a two brothers who are trying to get into a club called 'The Roxbury'. They are always trying to get in,but never get in. When that happens they club hop all night long. This movie is full of great disco fun. The songs are cool too. The two brothers argue over many problems. They eventually solve their problems. It is a happy movie that will make you cheer!!This movie is based on a skit from 'Saturday Night Live'!",8,3,3,28 September 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Great science fiction movie with great special effects!!
","This the first of the 'Star Wars' movies. It deals with robots, the force, good and bad. The robots escape from the empire during a battle.They land on a nearby planet. There they meet Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan, and Han Solo. With their new friends ,they leave to get the data on one of the robots is carrying to a safe location. But they get diverted, instead they arrive on a huge planetoid. It is a really a giant space station. They rescue a kind,beautiful young woman. After they save her, they have a series of adventures trying to leave the space station. They eventually leave the space station. The rebel forces and the empire have all out war outside the space station. Luke and the rebels save the day ,along with Han Solo's help. This movie started the careers of some todays hottest stars. Harrison Ford went on to do the 'Indy Jones' movies,the Tom Clancy Thrillers 'Partiot Games','Clear and Present Danger''Air Force One',  and many others. Carrie Fischer has starred in many movies since this . Her most recent 'Austin Powers'. Mark Hamill has starred in other things,but most of them  seem like b grade sci- fi. This movie is one of my favorite science fiction . It has great special effects and a fairly decent story line. This movie would have two sequels made. But those reviews are for another time!!Watch this movie if you like great science fiction and awesome special effects!!",10,0,0,29 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," should of been the thin story line instead!!!
","This movie is about World War 2 in the South Pacific. It is another war which is a very thin story line instead!The cast does what it can with the material, just it moves at a snails pace. The war is not the story very much. The movie is filmed wonderfully , just it need a editing job or something !!But many big name actors star in this movie John Cusack(Pushing Tin,Con Air), Sean Penn(The Game,U-Turn),George Clooney(The Peacemaker,Batman and Robin), Woody Harrelson(Play It To The Bone,EdTV,Money Train), Nick Nolte and John C. Reilly(Three To Tango, Never Been Kissed) all star in this candy coated war epic!!If you want a war movie go check out 'Saving Private Ryan' instead and avoid this movie!!!",1,1,5,23 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," my second favorite in the series!!
","Let me say that it is my second favorite in the saga. This episode is fast paced , a decent plot and cool special effects!!My favorite one is Return of the Jedi !!it is favorite for special effects though!!This movie also features an awesome score by composer John Williams!The score is classic even if you do not like all of his scores!!Look for future star Billy Dee Williams in this movie as well!!",9,0,0,2 October 1999
Back to the Future," an all time sci-fi comedy!!one of the best of the eighties
","This is one of my all time sci-fi comedies.It it one of the best of the eighties along with the star wars movies.In the movie a young man is accidently sent to the past of his parents ,because of this he has to repair the past so the future can saved.This movie also had two sequels made after it!!You can see huey lewis(of huey lewis and the news) as a parent/teacher in the gym where mcfly is auditioning for a dance as band with his friends!!look for billy zane in the 50's as a friend of the bad guy!!Maybe one day it will come out on DVD?an awesome movie that everyone can enjoy!!!also Lee Thompson(caroline and the city) is in the movie as the mother of marty mcfly!!a good movie anytime it justs getting better and better!!",8,0,1,24 September 1999
