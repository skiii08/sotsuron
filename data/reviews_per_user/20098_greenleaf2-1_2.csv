The Ring," Great fun; Very scary!
","My mother and sister and Movie Mom consistently say that this movie is bad, and they continue to compare other boring classic horrors to it. This has to be the best horror movie I've ever seen. It was scary, believable, and very well written, it was not boring in any way and didn't leave out any details. As the movie goes along, it's just like a confusing puzzle, and as it moves closer to the end, everything begins to fall into place for you, and it's fantastic how Verbinski can do it with such power. Chase's performance is breath-taking, and it angers me how they replaced her in the sequel. This is an excellent movie for all horror fans and makes an excellent edition to any horror collection. I recommend very highly.",10,1,2,31 July 2005
Bruce Almighty," An important movie to watch
","The first time I saw this, tears were streaming down my face from laughter. Jim Carrey delivers a hilarious performance, as always, and I believe that this is important for everyone to watch because there's a message in it. Bruce is basically a guy who thinks God is pathetic at ruling the universe. So one day, God comes along with a challenge for Bruce: He will give Bruce all of His almighty powers for Bruce to use any way he wants. Sounds pretty sweet, huh? Pretty simple? So does Bruce. As Bruce gets used to his new powers, things get much better in Bruce's life. He gets back at his backstabbing co-worker, trains his dog to use the toilet, and becomes the greatest reporter in the country. Things are great for Bruce, sounds like? Finally God tells him to answer all of the prayers people are sending him. To save time, Bruce says YES to all of them. That's when things begin to fall apart.The message this movie has for the world is that we underestimate God. We're constantly thinking of what a terrible job God is doing controlling our lives, but if we look deeper, we'll see that every link is connected to another link, and if one link breaks, the entire chain comes tumbling down. God makes our lives the way they are for a reason, and no matter how many times we think that God is not exactly doing a bang-up job, He knows what He's doing, and if we were to fix it, everything would get much worse. See this movie.",8,0,1,26 June 2006
