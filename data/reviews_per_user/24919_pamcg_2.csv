Iron Man 3," Brilliant: funny, deep and Downey Jr. at his best
","I went into this feeling very excited and slightly nervous: excited because it's FRICKIN' IRON MAN, but nervous because, after the disappointing Iron Man 2 and then the triumphant comeback in the Avengers, I didn't really know how they were going to be able to come close to that level of fun and thrills in a stand alone film again. I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG TO EVEN DOUBT IT. It's everything Iron Man should be: Downey Jnr. IS Tony Stark , his lightning fast wit enhancing the cocky comic character. The action was intense and, surprisingly, not just confined to Stark's alter ego. There were genuinely hilarious moments when the theatre was in stitches, and Kingsley and Pearce were epic in their roles.....AND there were a number of twists and turns that kept the movie fresh. The most interesting aspect that sets it apart from the Iron Man we've seen previously, however, is the depth that we delve into Stark's psyche, reminiscent perhaps of Bond in Skyfall.But, even in the darkest moments, it's never too far away from a one-liner.And that's what makes it enjoyable: it balances the serious with the playful, never straying too much into Dark Knight or Batman Forever(I wouldn't even dare and try to mention 1997's Douche-Man and Slobbin) territory, respectively. Black's direction is great (Downey's wit harking back to the brilliant Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), and I would hope that, if there is to be another Downey Jnr. stand-alone, that he would get the nod to direct. So, overall: great villain(-s ????), great allies, great comedy, great action, great depth, great direction and, most importantly, PERFECT Downey Jnr............oh, and Gwyenth Paltrow really DOES have the ass of a 22 year old......and a set of abs Terry Crewes would shed a tear at.",9,9,22,24 April 2013
Oblivion," Saw it all before
","Apart from the brilliant visuals and some exciting scenes, I felt this was a big let down.I was expecting more bang for my buck, but it takes a while for it to really get interesting. Cruise tries his hardest to hold the film together, but some of the dialogue sounds like it has been taken from a crappy version of Mars Attacks. It reminded me too much of a number of previous sci-fis(2001-A Space Odyssey springs to mind).The score also didn't suit some of the scenes, and was too-The Dark Knight-y in places,though it worked well for the action scenes. On top of this, you could see the generic ending coming from a country mile, which actually got a few laughs in the theatre I went to. Overall, very disappointing.....except for Olga Kurylenko. That woman could make a wolverine purr.",5,33,69,10 April 2013
