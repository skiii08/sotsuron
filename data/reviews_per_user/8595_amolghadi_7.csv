Angels & Demons," Tried its best to live up to the source.
","No Movie can beat it's book-source. Not even 'The Godfather' could.Look at this movie as a movie without any external linkings and you will understand how surprisingly good it is. Comparing a movie to it's book-source was the BIG mistake that people made when they rated the under-rated 'The Da-Vinci Code (2006)' which by itself was a very good movie.You just can't pack everything from a book into just a two-hour movie.Tom Hanks is as great as ever. Ron Howard did enough, as much as he could within his limits. This movie is really a very-fast paced one with lot of information flowing every second. Hang on to your seat-belts and go for a ride.*** Spoiler(IF it is one) ***My only complaint is: The Hassassin is down-graded.Otherwise, A&D is one of the best movies ever made. A perfect example of 8-out-of-10-stars type movie. No more, no less. Period.",8,9,17,30 May 2009
Batman Returns," A Comparison of those who played Batman in movies.
","Four Actors: Bale, Kilmer, Keaton, ClooneyBALE: He's leaps and bounds ahead and best among them all. No need for comparison. No need to explain.KILMER VS. KEATON: The real Issue. Kilmer had everything correct about him except one: he was in a Bad Movie. One simply canNOT refer to Bad scenes in a Badly scripted Bad Movie by a Bad Director to explain why the actor was not good to play his character. I understand, Kilmer could have never replaced Bale, but he would have easily replaced Keaton (who even though was a good Batman, WAS a wimp Wayne). Even if we forget that Keaton was the least good looking and had the least physicality required for an ideal Wayne/Batman respectively, we still cannot forget that he never had the ideal Wayne magnetic personality to attract females. He was a plain idiotic wimp as Wayne. Whereas while Kilmer was definitely muscular/handsome of the two, his was unfortunately limited by the Bad Movie itself that he worked in, that did no justice to the character of any roles in it, least of all Batman. Also, we can't forget that Kilmer did play a very good playboy-Wayne of whatever the script allowed him to. That is what is important (where Keaton failed). Because once you're inside the caped costume, it does not matter who is inside it, because nobody's going to recognise you anyway. So the character that must be given more priority is of 'Wayne' where one cannot hide behind a costume. Remember, Kilmer was a good Wayne/UNDERUSED Batman in a bad movie by a bad director. Keaton was a good Batman/wimp Wayne even in an overall OK movie by a very good director. Even worse was that, unlike Keaton who got two opportunities as Batman under the very good director to prove himself as Wayne and yet failed on all points as Wayne, Kilmer never got a second chance to prove himself as Batman even though he had proved himself as Wayne, no... not even under the same hellish director. MY POINT: If the physically strong, play-boyish Kilmer was that good as Wayne under the hellish Schumacher, imagine how great he could have been in costume (Batman) under the very good Burton. CLOONEY: As for 'Batman & Robin', every thing was wrong about it and so was Clooney who only played 'himself' both as Batman/ Wayne. And he will always be remembered for that. Anyway, except when the movies are called 'Syriana', 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind', Clooney is all 'himself' everywhere. No Surprises here. I seriously hope they destroy all records/sources of that B&R-crap.My Ranking: 1. Bale 2. Kilmer 3. Keaton. Clooney? Who Clooney?AS for this movie, I don't understand why people call this movie 'Dark'. This movie is Bad because it is TOO dark. Totally unwatchable / unenjoyable for children. On the contrary, the Penguin here, would give the innocent children, traumas for life. Don't ever show this movie to your children. Penguin is a seriously (pun intended) a horror crap here. Too Hideous, No Fun. And what's the use of the movie being Dark when you have No Character Development here. Penguin is a ridiculous villain and they have not shown even a single glimpse of his childhood, that is how the Penguins nurture him which is utterly impossible even in comics/fantasy, especially if they portray the movie and the Penguin as 'serious' and 'dark'. But yes, De Vito has been a good obedient actor here and did what he was told to do efficiently.(P.S.: As for the Comparison between those 'Batmen': Believe me, as the tag-line of 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' goes - 'It's Nothing Personal.' None of these four actors is my personal favourite. I love Denzel Washington.)",6,0,1,24 August 2008
L.A. Confidential," Should have been given the 'Best Picture' Oscar and ... (Part I)
","**** WARNING!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!! ****What some people thought and what I think about what they thought... (i) The Lana Turner gag was a huge nothing. --- All events in this movie have depths and these depths are the ones that are to be actually explored. This movie has a pessimistic atmosphere to it. So the Lana Turner gag was not actually supposed to be a joke to be laughed at. It was just to show what disgusting levels the plastic-surgery business had fallen to in those days and to what extent people can fall from grace to achieve name and fame even (if it is borrowed one). Fallen so much that even the REAL Lana Turner was suspiciously looked at to be a look-alike. (ii) The relation between White and Bracken was not required'--- Bracken is the one who inspires White to change himself from a bull-dozer to a microscope and White then starts working more intelligently and less physically on an individual case of his which latter provides him a big breakthrough. (iii) The only way that Ed Exley and Bud White can end their rivalry and unite to solve the crime is completely dependent on a scene where Exley visits the hooker. And that is a weak thread in the script.'--- Exley, White and Vincennes were working in not three altogether different continents but in the same city called ... 'LA'. Each of them found a thread for three different cases to work on, that anyway, would eventually have finally brought them together on One Big Case. What has the event of Exley (visiting/not visiting) the hooker got to do with it? The scene is in the script just to showcase the nature of Bud White and hasten the union of White and Exley. (iv) Some people thought that the wrong officer gets the girl and hence the movie is bad.--- These people didn't like 'LA' merely because the girl goes to a brutal headstrong guy like White who they think is unworthy of the girl. Unbelievable! I hope these people do not take 'film-criticism' as a career. Anyway, it's the choice of the female who she goes out with and no male can enforce himself upon her else he is punishable by law. (v) Some people thought that Exley is supposed to be the face of Morality and he is shown to kill another officer -unnecessarily shooting him in the back which is wrong.--- Now this reason to justify that 'LAC' is a bad movie is ridiculous. 'LAC' is actually about the very process of gradual degradation of Exley as a cop. That's why Exley killed the Officer by the time the movie ends.(vi) Some people thought White was not required to account for his murder of the TV-watching black guy which is a flaw in the movie.--- A cop killing someone in self-defense is NOT guilty. In order to prove that he just defended himself, White shoots a bullet from the black guy's line of fire towards the door to set up that he (White) was attacked.(vii) Finally some people thought that this movie is so highly rated because of younger viewers like the lure of sex and violence regardless of quality. --- Ridiculous. Do only young guys watch movies and rate them ? AND are most of the young guys irresponsible in life ? I doubt heavily.And this one... (vii) Some people thought it is one of those movies where everyone dies instantly from one gunshot except the main characters who get shot multiple times and take forever to die, if they do at all.--- What is trivial and non-vital to the cause of carrying the plot forward should be wrapped as early as possible. Which characters gets how many bullets to die is not at all important. But some particular characters who get shot multiple times and still live which is just to dramatically depict the grittiness, stubbornness of the nature of their character.And Lastly,... Kim Bassinger deserved the Oscar she won. Now don't ask me 'Why?'.By the way, this masterpiece was robbed of the Best Picture Win and some acting nominations as well. A perfect 10 on 10 from me.",10,2,3,27 July 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Cameron's Best Masterpiece. BUT the Greatest Sci-fi Movie Ever Made is ...
","This is a very, very good movie, especially considering that it was made so many years ago. Superb unparalleled Oscar winning Visual / sound Effects ... even today. This is Cameron's Best, better than the 'Titanic', in terms of contents. Schwarzenegger's Perfect here because this is the Perfect role him and nobody can match him, the Greatest Action hero of all time ... OK, just behind Jackie Chan / Bruce Lee. But in terms of Biggest Blockblusters at least.What to expect: An impeccable script, plot, storyline. Revolutionary Mind Blowing Visual/Sound Effects. Stan Winston (RIP) was a Master at the effects. Terrific Unforgettable Background Scores By Brad Fiedel(True Lies(1994)), an another Master.As far as I have remembered and observed: The following were the revolutionary FIRST steps in the various types of Visual effects we enjoy today. Each of these movies had unique first-of-its-kind Visual effects contained in them: Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) The Abyss (1989) Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) Jurassic Park (1993) Forrest Gump (1994) Titanic (1997) The Matrix (1999) Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999) The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) The Polar Express (2004)For me, the most realistic, non-Exaggerated, practical, Scientific movie ever made is Steven Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' which gets a 10/10 from me. Nobody beats that.In my personal opinion, as a Scientific movie, I rate both Terminator / Matrix series as 9/10,subtracting one star from each, simply because these movies contained some Time/Place Warping events (Paradoxes) which are a long way to happen even by today's Physics i.e. they are a LITTLE-BIT unbelievable for me considering I did a Major in Physics.",9,2,3,12 August 2008
The Dark Knight," The Joker : An Oscarworthy Performance, nothing less and a truly great Batman franchise unfolding.
","Boy, this only gets better and better! First of all, let's NOT compare 'The Dark Knight' to the excellent 'Batman Begins'. 'Begins' was just the Beginning, a prequel and never was something different than 'Knight' in a way so as to draw comparisons. It is a continuous process. This, the second of the 'Batman' franchise comes from the acclaimed director Christopher Nolan unleashing now with it the actual foresight and vision the director must have had in 2005 as to how a batman should be when his 'Begins' hit the theaters. The director took and used his time resourcefully in 'Begins' to build a crescendo right from the base, to explore what The Batman in fact was.In this movie, as a supporting actor Gyllenhaal provided the emotional factor to the plot effectively. Morgan Freeman, a seasoned veteran, exactly knows what he has to deliver in a Batman movie in a very short time. As in 'Begins', here too, he has delivered a crispy witty performance. The other Oscar winner, Caine, was heart-warming as the butler Alfred to provide moral support/guidance to Bat/Bruce, of course, with his own one-liners. Eckhart was brilliant in his acting as an honest, crime fighting District Attorney but the transformation from a DA to a Two Face was amazingly performed. Compared to him, the Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face was a joke. Oscar winner Jones too was capable of doing a much better job than he actually did but they never allowed him to. Tragedy is what Two-Face should depict and Eckhart did that successfully. Gary Oldman has done really well to play a character hanging delicately between his allies and enemies.The cinematography was outstanding. The camera angles made me feel like I was flying with the Batman. The background scores by Hans Zimmer (Gladiator, The Lion King, Batman Begins, The Da Vinci Code) and Newton Howard (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) were simply haunting right from the beginning till the end never losing the pace... just like the storyline. The editing was crisp. The action was terrific. The dialogs were simply superb. Bale's was a well-balanced performance. What we are looking for is a well trained, well educated, scientific-minded, have-seen-it-all-type, Ninja in a Batman movie with emotions under control. So all is well with Bale, The Perfect Batman, the perfect Playboy.And now, to the real 'Jewel' of the movie: Heath Ledger. With all due respect to Jack Nicholson, the three time Oscar Winner, he has finally been outclassed by Ledger in playing the role of this particular deadly, psychopathic, psychotic, ego maniacal, sinister, unconscionable, egregious character of one of the biggest adversaries of Batman known to Batman fans: The Chaos-spreading Joker which Nicholson never was, if the aforementioned qualities are compared. This is the Mind-Chilling-Man-Killing-Lip-Smacking-Smiling Joker we, as Batman fans, have known, read about and imagined. Nicholson has lost the race here to Heath Ledger. The previous franchise really was a comic book franchise ...literally. If they really wanted to make a serious real life metaphor of a comic book, they would have, but they didn't. Otherwise Nicholson could have also been chilling too. But this franchise is injecting Batman and his adversaries into Real Life and vice versa. Just like what The Joker in this movie says: 'This town deserves a better class of criminal... and I'm going to give it to them.' And truly Ledger has given it to us. Ledger has simply put astonishing life and sadistic energy in The Joker. The Joker here in this movie is like a nightmare come true. I always used to say: nothing gets more chilling or colder than Barry Foster in 'Frenzy (1972)', Anthony Hopkins in 'Silence of the Lambs 1991)', Kevin Spacey in 'SE7EN (1995)', Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List (1993)'. But here we can add one more chilling role to the league of the best 'cold-hearted' roles executed ever. Ledger has NOW truly put The Joker in the pantheon of the greatest movie villains ever. Watching this performance alone we can easily judge that Ledger, who died so young could easily have become Oscar material if he had lived. He can still win it as the Best Actor for this role posthumously though because his performance here is demanding one.This also is one of the Best Sequels Ever along with: Godfather II (1974), Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park 3(1999), Lord Of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), Lord Of the Rings: The Return Of The King (2003), Matrix Reloaded (2003), Mission Impossible 3 (NOT 2), The Jason Bourne Series, The Da Vinci Code (2006) - DVC is a sequel to Ron Howard's forthcoming Angels and Demons (2009). Not only is this the Best Batman movie, this is The Best Superhero movie and one of the best masterpieces ever made. Truly deserves many Oscars with at least the Best Actor's. If crime based 'The Departed' can be the Best Picture (because Raging Bull, Taxi Driver were better) than this definitely can also be. The previous franchise was literally comic, made for children. This franchise is dark and deep, made for teenagers / adults. And that is what a realistic Bat-Series meant to be. Based in the REAL world. By that, it does not mean Batman is for real. But he is in a world where rules of Physics hold true and are not distorted. Two more Batman movies from this franchise and this one will wipe out the ill-effects of the previous franchise ... completely.Just like The Joker says to Batman: 'You've changed things forever. There's no going back.' This franchise has changed things forever. There's no going back.And yes, Long Live Ledger (in our hearts). By the way, I was amazed at The Joker's Pencil Disappearing (sick) Trick. Don't Ever Try That At Home. This movie gets a perfect 10 on 10.",10,6,13,18 July 2008
Eyes Wide Shut," Humans are always Polygamous.
","Man: 'I never understood why you walked away (from medical studies).'
Friend: 'It's a nice feeling. I do it a lot.'The 'nice feeling' that the Man's friend, here, is referring to is perhaps, the Sense of Freedom that a man with No Attachments whatsoever, can enjoy without hesitations or boundaries...The Power to walk away from Commitments.Right at the beginning, the social event where the Man (who is a doctor) and his friend meet each other after many years, is an Anonymous Party, where no one knows anyone and hence one could make willful choices of actions towards perceiving that illusive personal Happiness he/she is in the quest for. This Party could be an Allusion to that ideal place where one hides away from the others for a while and does what one desires for experiencing Happiness, and it could be some Flirtation, Sex or a seemingly harmless combination of Heroin and Coke ...or just a passion for playing a plain Piano.The Man and his beautiful Wife, return from the Party, but only after having their Commitments for each-other seriously challenged, and they discuss, question and probe anything that defines any aspect of a marital/sexual relationship between a Man and a Woman. Love and Loyalty. Expectations. Jealousy. Wife's (illusive) desire for Security and Commitment, Human being's Polygamous Nature and the futile attempt to control it. The Wife even dreams of her subconscious desire to stray more and more away from the Man, mentally and physically.Realizing that the Wife is not entirely faithful to him, the Man gets involved into adventures of his own. But will he be really as deceptive as one of the earlier lines in the movie says: 'One of the charms of marriages is that it makes Deception a necessity for both the parties.' ?...Does their marriage survive this Storm ?Watch it in Stanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut (1999)'",10,1,1,14 January 2020
The Matrix Reloaded," Beautiful Intelligent Scientific Series. But only after...
","My appeal to all People: Rate DOWN any movie you want but ... ONLY IF you understand the movie totally and then think it does not deserve a very high rating and NOT because ... you simply did NOT understand the movie at all in the first place so it irritated you and you did not like it.Remember, it may really be a masterpiece like this one movie, valued down only due to YOUR incompetence.Plot: We're into a very, very futuristic life on earth to the extent that there is almost no life existing on the earth surface due to the Big War between Artificially Intelligent Powerful Machines who have taken control of themselves and us humans. The Former have taken the latter as slaves. And using humans as a source of their requirement for energies. But in order to ensure that the slaves don't rebel, the Machines create a Virtual Reality atmosphere called 'The Matrix' that represents a version of the 20th century and it wraps the humans with the Matrix so that the poor humans think everything is going on fine with them and everything is perfect in their universe. But soon, humans find out that the universe was far too perfect for their liking albeit only subconsciously and so the Machines consider that all humans might rebel which may result in non-yielding or 0 % efficiency of energy creation because humans are the source of energy after all. So the Machines create a new Matrix but NOW it also contains a separate space for the rebel humans, if any present, that they can use as a haven/ home for themselves called ''The Zion'. These Rebels in Zion are provided with an aim to find 'The One' (the Anomaly) who will be their leader and the only one to defy the Matrix. But their's a twist. The aim is also provided by the ... Machines ! ... thus creating an illusion for the humans again. And the Machines can regularly keep cleaning the Zion off the rebels whenever they want to. Also the Agents are nothing but some Infecting Viruses injected into the Matrix by the Machines themselves. Each Version of the Matrix has its own version of the Anomaly (Neo). In this movie, Neo, finally, has the two choices: 1. Returning to the Matrix but which will result in the destruction of all humans. 2. Allowing to clean the Zion and refilling it. Of course, his power of choice is too an illusion created by the Machines again. He in fact can only 'choose' the second one.Oh! I really love this Matrix series! Far too intelligent! It overestimated its audience! My Opinion: Perhaps this is the only SECOND perfect example of any masterpiece after Kubrick's/ Steven Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' to be voted down by some people NOT because they did not like it BUT because they did not like it since they did NOT understand it in the first place. And this opinion comes from a movie-crazy fan like me who has done a Physics Major and works in the field of Software. It is the various Technical Theories in this masterpiece that some people could not properly interpret and digest. And this makes some movie-fans go crazy and bring the rating down because: 1. it challenges their IQ that fails to stand up to the required criterion set by movies like these. OR 2. They have enough IQ but are simply too lazy to put efforts to grasp movies like this. (At the time of me writing this, this is overall rated 7.0 which is not bad but still it deserves a NINE.) The Matrix Series is the Second most Ultimate Masterpiece in the Sci-fi Criterion, only AFTER 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' which perhaps is one of the Best Masterpieces in cinema history. All these movies are better than '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The technicalities depicted in this intelligent film (...And I am not talking about the visual/sound effects of the movie) can be only be grasped (not totally but still...) by those in the engineering fields especially Software, Robotics and Electronics, basically anyone from the field of Artificial Intelligence. This movie is made for people like us. People like us don't care if this movie becomes the Greatest Blockbuster of all time or not. Simply because this movie satisfies us.What to Expect:If you are a fan expecting that a sci-fi movie ONLY means black leather, Ray-Bans, bullets, guns, explosions, ruthless man-killing robots and mind-boggling action scenes, then ... this IS the movie for you. And a lot of Stunning Visual Effects Extravaganza. PLUS a very,very intelligent plot line.Ironically, this is movie has not been made keeping the ordinary non-technical movie loving public in mind even though it IS concerned with the long-range future of all human beings.Also only two types of movies never win any Oscars: 1. The 'Razzie trash' types that don't go well with the critics because they are way below the IQ of the critics and hit below the belt. 2. The 'Artificial Intelligence' types that don't go well with the critics because they are WAY ABOVE the IQ of the critics. This movie belongs to the second category.The more times you watch this series, the more you learn.For me, perhaps the Best Sci-fi movie ever made till date, is the most realistic practical scientific movie: 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(2001)' which gets a 10 out of 10.But since this, the Matrix Series and the Terminator(1 and 2) series contain some Time and Space warping events that are a little too futuristic even by today's technology standards, I subtract one star from their ratings and give them both: 9 out of 10.",9,0,0,14 August 2008
