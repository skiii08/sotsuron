Alien vs. Predator," Alien v Predator guess who's Bishop
","This is better than the review I still love it three Predators vs Aliens and the Alien Queen. It's awesome to see some action. In Predator 2 at the end showed all the Predators including the Predator King at the end after Danny Glover killed the a Predator that took down his team. Bishop from Aliens is Mr Weyland head of Weyland Industries in the year 2004. Alien and Aliens where he is Bishop an android who's dead with a heart disease. Showing he's human. Gathers a group of expedition team of ice mountain climber, and scientists. The three Predators take down Weyland team on the ice and inside the Mayan Temple. In Predator 2 they were on Earth earlier in 1715. But on Alien v Predator it's during the Mayan civilization times. They were used as 'cattle' for aliens serpents. The Predators were seen as Gods came down on spaceships to be used for hunting for sport. It's an awesome film just saw it on HBO. I've seen it twice also have it on Blu Ray. Love the series.",6,0,0,26 May 2020
