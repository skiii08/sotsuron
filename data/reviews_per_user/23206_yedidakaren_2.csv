It," 8 out of 10.
","I enjoy watching this movie a lot because it represents an adventure, a thrilling one to be exact. There are some predictable scenes and I think it's odd for me to see that the 80s don't really look like the 80s but overall, it was good.I like how the monster represents a child's nightmare and the concept of not believing things we see will make it disappear is also very interesting which makes the adults think the kids are being 'kids'. That's what this movie about, a kid's nightmare right? Though, of course there were adult victims too.In spite of I don't read the novel, I think the characters are acting very well. But I'm sure the novel version is definitely more complex than it shown in the movie. And I'm curious on the monster's history.",8,1,2,3 November 2018
Hereditary," Recommend horror movie.
","This movie was one of the best horror movies I have ever seen! The story was fine just like any other cults story but what I like more about it was the plot and the cinematography, it's like their life was really recorded from the miniature house Annie has build. The acts were amazing and there was silence in their house ever since Charlie died which explains the grief on losing her, especially Annie because she wanted to speak to her child so badly and use the 'am-i-speaking-to-you' way.My favorite scene was when three of them trying to call Charlie in their living room, it was the scariest part for me because how both Steve and Peter showed how they were really scared was AMAZING. It's kinda disappointing that Paimon finally got Peter's soul but not every movie got the ending we wanted right?Talking about how horrifying the movie was, well it wasn't as scary as I thought but yes it still is scary for a horror movie.",9,1,3,3 November 2018
