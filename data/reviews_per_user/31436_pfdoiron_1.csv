United 93," What a wake-up
","This movie was done so correctly, I could not imagine even figuring that someone decided to take the chance to do it this way. It had a documentary feel, but the director had us as a spirit in the room, the plane, the control towers, the military command center, etc twitching and grimacing at the terror, the mistakes, the confusion. It was like, if these people could only hear me and see me as I traveled back in time to the 9/11 attack. No political statement, no overacting, and the actors that played the terrorists should be expecting a background check they were so convincing. NOT using well known actors with political agendas was the most ingenious part of this production. We will see if any awards are given out. I doubt it as the political agendas will prevent it. Earth to the people who have forgotten this attack. Shut the heck up, we are at war and these guys won't give up. Thats my political agenda.",9,1,3,22 June 2006
