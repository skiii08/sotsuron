Skyfall," Desperate Bond - a Batman with less gadgets
","First impression of 007 vs villain in this movie is like Batman vs Joker.They wanted a 'fresh' Bond to revive the 007 franchise, well they've got one, except the sacrifices were made on several key Bond aspects which I thought was important character and the movie series. The story have some unnecessarily long scene that made it boring and unfortunate short scenes that could have helped strengthen 007 and his relationship to other characters.Spoilers Alert! and sorry for any fragmented sentences..First of all, the lack of gadgets. Whatever happened to all those high tech weapons that used to wow every viewers in the cinema? All this one got was a slick pistol with a finger print recognition lock and a fun sized GPS device that I've have almost mistaken it for Zoolander's phone? Has the economy hit 007 as well that he had to go old school on his old ride in order to satisfy his 007 gadget crave?Second is the lack of women and art. The 'verbal jousting' conversations between 007 and female characters has always been one of 007's main traits. A good looking guy who fights evil, saves the country, and sweeps women off their feet. This movie has 2 women(3 if you count a the early one nighter in the movie) in which he had a 'thing' with, but I could only called it a 'thing' because there was maybe 3 minutes out of the 143 minutes of vague camera work that barely suggested some sort of sexual encounter. Bond did, however, had a homosexual conversation with his nemesis, reaching for new audience much?? 007 (especially this one) has a nice body and so are all other female characters show something, make it look like art, come on! I hope they didn't minimized these sex (oh let's just call it that) scenes because the present view on 007 being a womanizer icon is a bad thing then I would say they might as well chop off 007's balls - because people who made this movie have none. I also missed the Bond 'silhouette' music intro as they decide to opt for semi-silhouette which is disappointing. I've always enjoyed that guns & girls silhouette art show before a good action movie of 007!Third is the whole Bond approach. What makes Bond tick? He make the approaches! The Skyfall story is quite the opposite. There was no approaching to a fight in this one. Bond ended up doing a defending a fort type of fight and stabbed bad guy in the back.. if they are going for a more human 007 then they did it, because 007 look desperate.Not to compare anything between MI series and the modern 007's but after watching the Skyfall all I wanted to do is to watch MI4 so I can feel better.. I guess Skyfall just left an unfamiliar taste that struck me as out of place.",6,4,10,12 November 2012
