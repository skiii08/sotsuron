Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Very controversial but I like it
","This movie is very controversial in that the overall rating is fairly high but most of the comments here are very negative. For this single reason you shall watch it (and rate it yourself). Be warned that the movie is packed with political/reality jokes. You may find some scenes are very gross (like the one of hotel fighting), and some overdone (like the one in supermarket). My wife literally left at the hotel fighting scene.If you watched the DVD version and you think you can take more, you can find 8 more censored footages in 'other materials' of the DVD. The displayed version is of the right length. It's a bit too much with all the footages.",8,3,6,2 July 2007
