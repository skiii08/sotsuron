Source Code," A twisted brilliant thriller.
","Wow. Having just watched Source Code I must say that this is a great movie. The storyline is filled with twists and turns. The movie is smartly built and wonderfully acted. Jake Gyllenhaal acts with emotional depth and gives us a look into the life of someone thrown into such a strange and unsettling circumstances. The movie makes you feel very smart for understanding each twist and turn. Every single second is well thought out and has the rest of the movie in mind. The movie is clever. Of course the movie does toy around with some very profound ideas, especially in the last few minutes, and sometimes they don't always work. However most of the time the movie leaves you guessing and feeling sad for the loss and pain of the characters, escpically the main character. The sheer complexity makes it mind bending. But at the same time it's very straightforward to understand. All in all its a great film with a few missteps are outdone by the brilliance of the film. Thank you for reading. Goodbye.",9,3,5,24 November 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," An Unfinshed Journey
","Full Disclosure: I love the LOTR movies. They exemplify what movies can be. They also prove that blockbusters can be Oscar winners. The Hobbit is not that. It doesn't have the same sense of grand scale spread across many different plot threads. To its credit An Unexpected Journey is a much more focused film than the LOTR films. It follows Bilbo Baggins, the future uncle of LOTR's Frodo Baggins. The plot rarely moves away from Bilbo(played with soul by Sherlock's Martin Freeman.) An Unexpected Journey really is Bilbo's Unexpected Journey. Richard Armitage lends a gruff edge to the character of Thorin Oakenshield. Overall, the action scenes are few and far between with none having the same epic scale as LOTR's. The ending is also a bit weak with too much set up for the next film. As many flaws as the movie has, I'm still glad I went to see it.",7,0,2,30 December 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," A rare Marvel Misstep
","When I walked into my local movie theater to watch Guardians of the Galaxy I was sure Marvel Studios was incapable of making a bad film. How ever after leaving the film I am worried for Marvel's future projects. But now the good stuff: Chris Pratt leads a star- studded cast with charisma and style, Vin Diesel delivers a surprising emotional performance as Groot a tree with a three word vocabulary (I am Groot.). The rest of the guardians give good performances with Dave Bautista as the mumbly mound of muscle known as Drax giving the movie some of its best lines. IE: Bautista: when did we decide that? Pratt: Like 3 Seconds ago!!!. Bautista: I wasn't listening I was thinking of something else. Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana round out the Guardians and the last of the decent performances. The supporting cast is not strong with weak performances from Lee Pace as the Kree villain Ronan the accuser, Karen Gillian as his henchwoman Nebula, And John C. Reilly as a Nova Corps officer who's name I have forget ton already. Another problem is the internal logic. People should suffocate in space. Nope. Touching the marvel equivalent of a nuke should kill you. Nope. It feels like a standard space opera with a forgettable story and supporting characters. Unfortunate Indeed",5,18,39,7 August 2014
