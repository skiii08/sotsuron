Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Who cares whatever one else thinks.
","I like this movie. I came out of the theater four years ago  and thought the movie was great. I've seen it a bunch since then and I still think it is a good movie.  People's expectations are too high. 'It's not as good as the original trilogy,' they say. Well of course not.  Not many movies are. You have to take it for it is.  The acting is not great, dialogue could be better, but it is still a good movie.  It has the best lightsaber battle than all five movies, and the pod racing scene is amazing.Everyone hates this movie,yet it is the fourth highest grossing movie of all time(If not for the re-release of E.T. it would be third) Stop being so picky people and just enjoy the good moments. It's easy to make fun of the bad parts and curse this movie.  I could think a thousand movies that are worse.(Especially some that are over-hyped.)",8,2,4,22 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Hope better than empire and Jedi?
","No way is a new hope better than Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The first Star Wars has great special effects, but Empire has much better. The scenes with the millenium falcon are brilliant and better than any scene in Hope. Someone wrote how Hope has the best drama. You gotta be kidding me?The acting is really flat in Hope and Empire is much darker.  It's the darkest one.  In my opinion it is Empire is the best one and Jedi is right behind it.  Jedi also has better effects and a better Death Star battle.Let's just end any debate that Hope is better than Empire or Jedi.",10,0,3,24 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," better than menace
","I really like this movie. It still does not hold a candle to the 'Holy Trilogy', it's good enough to be mention in the same breath.  It starts out with amazing chase scene in corizont.  Hayden Christiansen is not a horrible Anakin.  Everyone thinks the love story stinks, but it works for me(Natalie Portman is too hot for me care).The end battle scene is amazing and you can't hate Christopher Lee and Count Dooku.I definitely think it is one of the best movies 2002.  I just can't wait for Episode III.",7,0,0,23 April 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," wonderful
","I've seen Matrix, X-men, the Hulk, and even Finding Nemo.  I loved all these movies, but I think that T3 is the best movie of the summer.  It had a better story than the Hulk, more action packed than X2 and more consistent(computer graphic wise) than Matrix.It was exciting from the very begin.  The first car chase seen was jaw dropping.  I swear my mouth was opened the whole time from amazement. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time. Most of the computer graphics actually looked real.  There are very few movies that have looked as good.There are problems though. It is not as good as the first two.  Allow there are better action scenes, the character development is lacking. In T2, you can sense a closeness between Arnold and John, but it just wasn't there in T3.  Also there was little chemistry with John and lover interest Claire Danes.  Danes is also suppose a close relationship with her father in the movie, but they don't develop it enough for you to care.Despite that it is a well made movie.  My advice, if you want a story as good as the first two, don't go.  This movie is not going to win any oscars. If you love a good action movie, this is a must see.",8,0,0,2 July 2003
Bring It On," What I want.
","This was a wonderful creative, hip movie. Not wait I was thinking about something else.On a scale of one to ten, it sucked.The dialogue was cheesy. I didn't find anything funny.  It's just the same stupid teen junk.  This suppose to be a movie that promotes cheerleaders, yet I had a lower opinion of cheerleaders after I saw this movie.
I felt sick after this movie. I've never felt sick after movie before or since I saw Bring it On.If you read this you might think that I'm overbearing male who doesn't like teen movies, you'd be wrong though.  I find some of them enjoyable, this is not one of them.If not for Battlefield Earth and Dungeons and Dragons, this would be the worst movie of 2000",Null,1,1,24 January 2003
