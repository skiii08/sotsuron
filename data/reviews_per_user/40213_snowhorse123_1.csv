Changeling," compelling story plot with superb acting
","I had never though Angelina Jolie a good actress and my belief was made even more concrete after watching 'The Tourist.' But her acting in Changeling is convincing, truthful enough to change my opinion of her. But most importantly, as I agree to some of the reviewers' opinions, Clint Eastwood's approach to violence is so delicate and creative, leaving room for imagination without giving violence too much attention, so that I was able to be more absorbed into the plot. The whole atmosphere of the movie, and the slow background music captured the old school feel so well. Overall, great modern classic. PS. I think Hillary Swank could have been good also.",10,1,1,12 May 2012
