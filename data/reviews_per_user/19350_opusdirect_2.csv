First Man," Well made snooze-fest
","I think my title says it all. Not certain how a quality director like Damien Chazelle can make such a completely boring movie about such a compelling character and an incredible subject, but he managed to do so. I gave it 5 stars of 10 because the movie was well made (except for the music), but it was just boring.",5,1,1,17 May 2020
Yesterday," Best for true Beatles fans
","One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Yes, the boy-loses-girl theme is old hat, but the original concept of the movie is excellent. Spoiler - there are NO explosions, or super hero's, or cops or drug kingpins, or terrorists - it's just a fun, original movie with GREAT music. Himesh Patel does all his own singing and playing of the greatest rock music ever, the music of the Beatles. Kate McKinnon plays the ultimate smarmy L.A. music agent. There is an incredible, heartwarming moment near the end. Wait for it. It's so beautiful.",10,1,2,15 March 2020
