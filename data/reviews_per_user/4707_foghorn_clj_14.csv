Iron Man 3," AWESOME! But I can see why comic book fans would be disappointed
","OK just to make things clear upfront. I have never read an Iron Man comic book but am a huge fan of all the movies (including The Avengers).There's really only one word that adequately describes how I felt about this movie... BITCHIN'! It has all the action, tech and humour of the first two movie on steroids.Now at the first I couldn't understand why so fans bagged this movie out something chronic. But after talking to a comic book fan about the progression of the comic book storyline I kind of understand their disappointment.The bottom line is if you're looking for it to follow the traditional storyline of the comic books you're not going to be happy. If you go in and see it just as part of the previous movies I think most people would enjoy it.",9,4,14,28 April 2013
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A pointless and lacklustre addition to the franchise
","OK so I had A lot to say about 'The Force Awakens' and mostly I pointed out all the plot holes that I could drive a semi trailer through. But after seeing Rogue One I appreciate TFA a lot more because at least it was entertaining and engaging.Rogue One is boring. Boring, boring, boring, boring and boring. I can appreciate where it sits within the timeline and was actually interested in how to the Death Star plans got into R2D2. However the story is so ludicrously unimaginative that I wish I could unlearn the official story and go back to making up something myself.The fundamental problem is that the writers forgot this was a Star Wars movie until about 75% of the way in and then went 'Oh crap there's supposed to be space battles in this thing.' And here begins the rant: spoilers ahead...Let's start with the main character Jyn. Firstly, I said this in my review of 'Guardians of the Galaxy' and I will say it here, killing a main characters parents when they are a small child is not enough to make me give a crap about what happens to them. So she was orphaned when her mother was killed and her father chose to go back to the Empire.. just like millions of other children effected by the war. Secondly this character is so unimpressive and has basically no skills that are helpful to the Rebellion other than the fact that she's the daughter of the genius scientist behind the Death Star. Sure she can fire a phaser but that's pretty much as helpful as she gets. Why a group of committed Rebellion fighters would follow this girl into battle confounds me.Cassian the rebel fighter assigned to help Jyn is just as unimpressive. We're supposed to feel for him because he lost his family and has been forced to kill people for the Rebellion and feels bad about it but in the end you feel nothing.K-2SO - ah the generic and expected robot comedy relief that brings a few chuckles but nothing much else (which is no reflection on Alan Tudyk who I love but they didn't give him much to work with) And whilst it was nice to see Darth Vader back in all his glory (and in the voice of James Earl Jones) his cameo was blink-and-you'd-miss-it and really doesn't add to the story in any way.And then basically all the other characters were so unimpressive that I don't remember any of them and therefore have nothing to say about them.The 2 stars I've given to this review are purely for the CGI in the final 45 mins of this movie which is pretty bloody spectacular. But once it got to that point I'd stopped caring a while ago. The exception being the CGI young Princess Leia which was just CREEPY.So to summarise: Boring and unimaginative shouldn't have been made in the first place.",2,457,885,18 December 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Ugh!
","Never has a movie made me more furious than this cacophony. Not only does JJ Abrams coddle Star Trek fans with this drivel it's so predictable my eyes almost rolled out of my head. Below is a detailed breakdown of my problems with this movie: 1. Screwing the Prime Directive in the first 5 minutes of the movie WHAT WAS THAT??? It's the most important guiding principle of the Federation and they have Kirk just casually break it without a thought to the responsibility or magnitude of his decision. And where the hell was Spock's 'we cannot break the prime directive' BEFORE they decided to put him inside the volcano and have Kirk steal a precious artifact from the locals. And what's worse KIRK LIES ABOUT BREAKING THE PRIME DIRECTIVE AND STILL GETS TO THE BE FIRST OFFICER ON THE ENTERPRISE! (And through a remarkable twist of fate, captain again).What was the point of that entire sequence if in the end breaking the Prime Directive didn't change a damn thing and didn't have any serious ramifications for the character??? It takes something away from the reverence that previous Star Trek movies and the TV shows placed on the importance of this rule. As a Trekkie I personally found that insulting.2. Could Karl Urban have over-acted anymore??? 3. Chekov's accent is so annoying every time he speaks I wanted to punch him in the face and push him out of the nearest airlock 4. Uhura They had the opportunity to have a strong female character in this role and all they have her do is be constantly whining about her relationship with Spock. Oh yes and she occasionally gets to play translator and shoot a phaser. She could've been so much cooler and kick ass. JJ Abrams really needs to have a talk to Joss Whedon about the portrayal of strong female characters in film and TV.5. Spock Yep still don't buy Zachary Quinto as Spock. To me Spock is supposed to have this silent strength where as Zachary has 'bored-strength'. It's not enough to just look blank, I have to FEEL the strength and calmness. One of the two stars I gave to this review however is for the speech he made to Uhura in the vessel on the way to the Klingon home planet. That was actually pretty good.Oh and Spock yelling 'Khannn!!' LAME. MORE LAME THAN ANYTHING THAT HAS EVER BEEN LAME BEFORE.6. Special Effects Okay yes the special effects weren't bad (especially Kirk and Khan flying through space) but seriously JJ you need a new colour scheme. That red forest almost blinded me.There's more but right now in my infuriated state I cannot articulate them.Basically it comes down to this: insulting, boring, cliché and predictable.",Null,4,9,25 September 2013
Aquaman," Pathetic
","Really really pathetic. It's like they took every superhero movie trope, infantilised them and then smacked them together in a movie.Love Jason Momoa but definitely not strong enough to carry his own movie. He's a sidekick with some great one liners and nothing more.But I think the thing that really let's the movie down is the CGI. Very cartoonish. It's like Green Lantern only slightly better.Although I'm obsessed with Amber Heard's hair.",4,2,3,6 September 2019
"I, Tonya"," I wanted to love it because it seems like everyone does...
","I went into watching this film with exceptionally high expectations given the hype (ie. Oscar nominations and wins).Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it worth all the hype? Sadly no.Like many reviewers here I found this movie tonally confusing. At one point it's a serious view of domestic violence, the next it's like an episode of the Three Stooges. Also I was waiting for some kind of emotional payoff that never came.Sure Allison Janney was fantastic in the 10-20 mins of screen time total she got. But I can't help but be disappointed at how under utilised she was.Margot Robbie was fine playing a redneck figure skater, she just wasn't Tonya Harding.(By the way whoever did the CGI on Robbie's face during the ice skating scenes needs to be fired. So obvious it distracts the viewer).",5,1,1,27 October 2018
Doctor Strange," Entertaining but ultimately lacking
","Full disclosure: I have an irrational hatred of Benedict Cumberbatch. Literally I just want to punch him in the face every time he appears on my screen. But I love Marvel movies so there I was watching Dr Strange.Other than my personal distaste for Cumberbatch (and every one of his acting performances including this one, terrible) this movie has three main problems.1. The 'magic' is explained with incomprehensible gibberish. So much so that really all I could do was enjoy the CGI and pretty colours in all those scenes because I had no bloody idea what was going on.2. The cape was a more interesting character then Dr Strange. Enough said.3. The ending is pedestrian and convenient. Using time travel to fix a problem? Yawn.Bottom line: Watch it once to get the information you need to know to proceed further into the MCU (and enjoy the pretty colours) but not a classic to be re-watched.",3,0,1,17 February 2019
Interstellar," Stunning visuals cannot make up for storyline that woefully overreaches
","Full disclosure: I had ZERO interest in seeing this movie in the first place. But I got dragged along by my friends to see it... and I wish I could get my 3 hours back.There are 4 fundamental issues I have with this movie:1. The lengthNolan could've easily gotten 2 or 3 movies out of the script for this movie. In it's own right each 'acts' of the story could've stood alone & been amazing. Instead Nolan condenses them together in a narrative that is flat and feels never ending.2. You never connect to any of the characters on an emotional level. McConaughey's performance as the protagonist Cooper, whilst complex enough to keep you mildly interested, fails to hit any emotional notes. Even when he leaves his kids (possibly forever) I didn't care. And hathaway's character was mostly boring/annoying and her speech about love was painfully cliché. 3. The science fiction elements Now I'm no physicist but despite all the study previously completed about black holes we're just supposed to believe that a guy in a ship can fly into a black hole and not be pulled apart & magically escape???? Light can't escape a black hole but this guy can!! Now there's suspending disbelief and there's flagrantly ignoring years of scientific research.Oh and don't even get me started on the inception-style ridiculousness at the end and the magic revelations drawn by cooper and his daughter from thin air. The science makes NO SENSE. 4. TARS the robot As much as I can appreciate Nolan going away from the conventional android-type robot for the film, a robot that rolls across the water in the shape of an asterisk and picks someone up and rolls back??? Come on.On the plus side the robot was the funniest part of the movie (again probably got a great thing).In conclusion: The special effects were amazing but the story was a horrible mis-match of several ideas (some that worked and a lot that didn't).",2,6,12,8 November 2014
The Bourne Identity," Bourne Identity = Bored out of my mind
",I've wondered for years why I never managed to watch Bourne Identity in it's entirety. Now having sat down and forced myself I now understand. I'm sorry it might be a realistic spy movie but it has SERIOUS pacing issues.,5,0,3,4 May 2018
Face_Off," The best of what 90's action movies were all about.
","Directed by John Woo and starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage at their best(you know, before their mutual careers nosedived off a cliff) Face/Off is an epic action/drama that goes beyond the usual explosions and gun fights, giving the audience something more to think about.The idea of two characters literally swapping faces with the CGI technology of the 90's would've been completely ludicrous and laughable had it not been for the performances of Travolta and Cage. Both actors playing the sociopathic Castor Troy are BRILLIANT. And oddly enough both of them bring something different to the same character without making it seem like two different people playing the same role.And of course with John Woo at the helm the directing and action are fantastic. There is a particular moment during a fight where the two main characters to turn face one another with a mirror in between them that just blows your mind.This is my favourite movie of all time and makes me nostalgic for the days of the 90's action movies.",9,4,6,27 June 2016
Big Hero 6," Underwhelming (and a blatant rip-off of a popular sci-fi franchise)
","Oh what potential this movie had. I mean what movie could go wrong with a giant, lovable, sweet, inflatable robot as a main character?? A character so adorable that grown women would buy stuff toys of it to sleep with.But alas the execution is so scattered & convoluted that the charm factor is totally lost. Where to begin?1. The beginning - unnecessarily long winded. The BOT fights & tech convention didn't really need to be a part of the story. 2. 4 supporting characters - woefully underdeveloped to the point of being totally superfluous. Boring and unnecessary.3. Not enough time spent 'getting to know bay max'. Seriously the entire appeal of the character is that it's sweet and adorable and naively funny. Instead almost immediately Hiro turns him into a warrior to fight. And Hiro turning all homicidal halfway through & asking Baymax to kill Callaghan was frightening for a kids movie.4. The main villain's use of the micro-bots - uninspired and boring. Seriously they can take any form and all he does is constantly shoot them in a straight line towards the heroes?5. The flagrant rip off of 'Stargate' - I mean there's an homage and there's blatant copying. A round metallic circle that creates a blueish, water-like event horizon which transports people from one portal to another??? And don't even get me started on the whole 'going into the event horizon and finding the girl in some temporal dimension'.But all the adult over-analysis not withstanding, overall it was a boring labored story with a few genuine laughs here & there.",4,55,151,3 January 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," worth a chuckle or two but nothing new or special
","Like so many others I saw this movie for two reasons, because for the most part (the exceptions being Captain America 1 and Thor) I enjoy marvel movies and 2, because my friends raved about it. One of them even said it was better then 'The Avengers' which quite frankly is a huge call in my book.Like the title of my review says, yes I laughed in places. Yes I figuratively drooled when Chris Pratt took off his shirt. And yes I liked the characters of Rocket and Groot. But that's it. I wasn't particularly attached to any of the characters personally (the character I felt most for was a tree with a vocabulary of 4 words. Work that one out.) The bad guys (there were two and right now I can only remember one of their names and I saw the movie 2 hrs ago) were one dimensional and felt evil just for the sake of being evil.Let me make one thing abundantly clear. Killing a main character's mum right at the start is not enough to make me emotionally invested in what happens to him. Almost every superhero has at least one dead parent. There has to be more. Oh and sibling rivalry? Yawn. A popcorn movie that is entertaining but nothing ground breaking.",6,3,10,16 August 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not as good as the first... But close.
","After the perfection of 'The Avengers' a sequel was always going to be a tough ask. Never the less it's Joss Whedon so my expectations were high.Overall it's darker and deeper than the first. However the story arc is pretty much the same as the 1st. Big threat emerges, avengers get their ass kicked, avengers sulk, avengers rally and save the day. It's comfortingly familiar but still a little disappointing nonetheless.Firstly the great stuff:1. Even for a darker film the Whedonesque sense of humour is still everywhere. If anything this film had more laughs than the first. The party scene is hilarious (seriously I could've watched 2 hours of just that). I will agree with others that the humour in this movie isn't as organic as the first 2. The Tony/Bruce intellectual bromance gets some nice screen time. So does Jarvis. Seriously I don't think I've ever had such strong emotions for a computer program.3. Ultron = awesome. I have no idea what villain a lot of the other people on here were watching but I thought ultron was complex, funny, a little psychotic and evil. I forgot he was a robot for most of it.And now the bad...1. The fight scene at the end was ridiculously, needlessly long (not to mention a little boring). The never-ending army of robots attacking was particularly uninspired (too much like the end of iron man 3). And I cannot understand why ultron choose the method of destroying the earth that he did. He could've achieved the same result with a far easier and less convoluted plan. 2. Vision. All I can say is WTF?! I don't understand how he came into existence, who the hell he is, what the deal with the stone was... I could go on & on. Seriously I had to ask my friend at the end of the movie who the hell he was. They clearly forgot that not everyone is the theatre would be a comic book fan.3. Unlike the first there wasn't the same equal screen time for all the characters. It honestly could've easily been called 'Iron Man 4' with the amount of screen time Tony Stark got. Thor was basically comedic relief in this movie with some ridiculous storyline about water and visions which had no context whatsoever. Captain America didn't know what his role was.But nice to see hawkeye get some screen time.Verdict: not as good as the first but still enjoyable to watch.",7,0,4,26 April 2015
Black Panther," Yet another overrated, lacklustre, pandering snooze fest
",I didn't want to see this movie. The Black Panther character made zero impression on me during Captain America - Civil War. But like alot of people I watched it because the reviews were so positive.Despite my reservations I went into this movie with an open mind. That mind was quickly bored beyond belief and frustrated at the predictable politically correct plot. Casting an entirely African American group is a hollow gesture when the storyline and dialogue is so stilted and pathetic.If you take the novelty of the cast and some of the CGI out the rest of the movie is ALOT of talking about nonsense and some fight scenes.,2,3,6,5 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Get swept up in the nostalgia and enjoy it... just don't think too hard about it.
","OK so I went into TFA with very low expectations, mostly because it was directed by JJ Abrams and he single-handedly slaughtered the Star Trek timeline with his two horrendous movies (don't get me started on that we'll be here all day).So I was pleasantly surprised at the beginning of this film that it actually felt like a Star Wars film. From the opening credits to the storm troopers and ship designs it gave me that warm and fuzzy nostalgic feeling from my childhood which pretty much carried me throughout the movie and let me walking out of the cinema having thoroughly enjoyed it.However when the nostalgic feeling eventually dissipated and I actually thought about the content of the movie there were so many plot holes it was ridiculous (I've actually seen a blog where someone has collated a total of 40 plot holes in total. Google it, it's impressive). SPOILERS AHEAD! You have been warned! As so many have before me have pointed out I can't start this review without acknowledging that it was a blatant re-hashing of Episode IV. And through my nostalgic delirium JJ managed to avoid me noticing this until the moment in the command centre when they discussed how to destroy the Star Killer (and in particular how to disable the shield). Yeah we noticed JJ. Oh and FYI once you take all the fuel from a sun it burns out and there's no sunlight any more. It doesn't just magically re-ignite itself. Overall everything was too convenient to the point that I roll my eyes now just thinking about it. The best example being that Han and Chewy just HAPPENED to be near Jakku at the same time Rey and Finn flew the Millennium Falcon off the planet in god knows how many years? Riiiiight. So in order to truly articulate all of my feelings about this movie I shall break it down by character:Leia: No disrespect to Carrie Fisher but she couldn't act in 1983 and she clearly hasn't taken any acting classes in the last 22 years because she still can't act. Her only saving grace is that her most important scene was with Harrison Ford and he made her look really really good. Also what qualifies her to be a General when she's not completed any military service? Han Solo: Yep Harrison Ford pretty much makes this movie watchable. Let's face it, a cantankerous, sarcastic Han Solo is funny. Also unlike some people who have reviewed on this site I totally buy the whole going-back-to-being-a-smuggler-even-though-he's-well-past-his-prime- as-a-way-to-deal-with-his-son-going- Dark-Side thing. A lot of the times when we're in emotional turmoil we like to run away to a point in our lives where everything was good. And finally he deserved a much better death than what he got quite frankly. He just stands there while his son guts him with a light saber? And what the hell were Chewy, Ren and Finn doing just watching it happen?!Kylo Ren: Yeah don't make a petulant 20-something-year-old with major daddy issues the bad guy of your movie. And if you are going to do that, DON'T LET HIM TAKE OFF THE BADASS LOOKING HELMET. Rey: I liked Daisy Ridley's performance a lot. My criticisms about her character are not a reflection of her acting, but of the writing. Making the female character instantly an expert at flying the Millennium Falcon was just laziness. Oh and even though she had never heard of the Force and believed it was a myth before this little adventure she instinctively knows that she can manipulate weaker minds to release her from her shackles and successfully carry on a light saber fight with her cousin (who has actually trained as a Jedi). Ugh!Finn: Oh where do I begin? A storm trooper who was kidnapped as a child, raised by the First Order and then on his first mission he freaks out and releases a prisoner to escape? And for some reason it seems like this is the first time this has ever happened in 30 years + but the First Order don't seem all that concerned about it? And for someone who's been indoctrinated by the First Order for most of his life he's social skills are remarkably well developed. And don't even get me started on how convenient it is that he knows everything about the Star Killer even though he worked in sanitation and how to shoot blasters on the Millennium Falcon like he's been doing it all his life. And finally YOU'RE NOT A JEDI SO PUT THE DAMN LIGHTSABER DOWN. Not cool man. Not cool.Poe: I like Poe a lot. Although I thought it was rather convenient that when the fighter crashed into Jakkhu and he was thrown free from the crash his jacket was left behind? How did that happen I wonder?Snoke: Yeah if you're going to rip off a bad guy from another sci-fi movie don't make it a cross between Gollum from LOTR and Parallax from 'Green Lantern'. Enough said. Captain Phasma: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF A HAVING A BADASS FEMALE STORM TROOPER CAPTAIN WHEN AT THE FIRST SIGN OF CAPTURE SHE JUST DOES WHATEVER HER HOST TAKERS WANT?? I could go on and on and on but I should get back to work now. Last word: Entertaining with a few laughs but plot holes big enough to fly the original Death Star through.",4,16,20,3 January 2016
