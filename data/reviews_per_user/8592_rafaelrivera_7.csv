The Ring," Pure Evil!!
","Hi there! to all of you lovers of the genre, i must say this film is exactly what you were looking for long! the plot's great i must say i've seen the movie twice and still scared me like the first time. Anyway the film's kind of dark, don't expect to leave it in the theatre it goes home with you for a while!ja,ja.(not joking). It is really intense! ** Spoilers ahead ** it starts  with this girl who dies after seen a strange videotape with rough images and a doomed call the minute after seeing it!! There's where reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) starts investigating the strange death, she founds the tape and right after she sees it the phone rang and behind the misterious call a voice of a child saying 'seven days' wich is the time of life she  have left after seeing this tape. So then Rachel must hurry to find out what's it all about along with Noah (Martin Henderson) who also sees the tape a day after Rachel. The mistery clears up little by little and nothing's what it seems believe me, there's even a time when you think its ending hollywood style, but the really scary stuff is yet comming!! I must say i liked the film  it's very original, but pay much attention because the plot doesn't give everything directly away, some people whom had seen it stays with plot holes, may be 'cause of the state of fright they're in the moment. I liked the performance of Naomi Watts wich i liked since David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. and the young David Dorfman who plays Rachel's son Aidan. Go see this film you wont regret it!! i give The Ring *** out of ****.",9,0,0,30 December 2002
The Others," one of the year's best!
","All i can say about The Others is that is one of the best films of this year and also in the genre of terror and suspense next to the Sixth Sense. It is chilling, well written, great performances, excellent photography and above all great story! I just saw this movie yesterday and i'm still  thinking about the ending, you just can't imagine the end of the story, i was really impressed by it! i think Alejandro Amenábar scored big with this one, all i have to say is go and see it, if you haven't you won't regret it! especially if you're fan of the genre.",9,1,2,1 November 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," kicks ass!
","I just went to the premiere of this movie yesterday at a local theatre, and i totally enjoied it from begining to end. I must say my expectations of the movie were not the best but... how wrong was i, just seeing Master Yoda in combat was enough satisfaction (moment that i personally think was the best of the film) it was just great! i think this film is much better than episode I. This film is loaded with action,romance, chills an great story line. With nothing more to say but GO SEE IT RIGHT NOW! if you haven't, i end my comment. I give the attack o the clones **** out of ****. EXCELLENT!!!",10,0,0,1 July 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," great comedy!
","I must say that when i saw the trailer, i wasn't hoocked to this production, but then it opened on U.S. and U.K. with great box office numbers, and i though may be this could be good. By the time it opened nationwide in Mexico i went to see it and had the time of my life watching it! i mean Renée Zellweger is really good at comedy and the story has lots of funny situations, that are not on the trailer(like in most films does),i recommend this film,i don't think you'll regret it. I give Bridget jones's Diary ***1/2 from ****.",9,0,0,26 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," outstanding and brilliant!!
","Great story, photography, acting, etc. This is the greatest film of the year 2002! I think director Peter Jackson did an outstanding job with 'LOTR: The two towers' there's a particular care for details in every one of the scenes and in the beautiful landscapes portrayed in it that would definitely make this film unforgettable. The story line goes fast (You won't even feel it's three hours at the seat!) all i can say is that this is a great visual pleasure and i give it **** out of **** a perfect 10!!",10,0,0,27 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," great musical experience!
","I didn't expect that much from a musical film, but the truth is that Moulin Rouge blows your mind. It has great soundtrack, excitement,suspense, hearthbreaking moments and most of all beauty in it, i enjoyed the climax that music added to the film and the very own performances by Ewan Mc Gregor and Nicole Kidman who i didn't expect to be that great in the singing aspect,but both of them were great at it. Any way i highly recommend this film because it really takes you in a trip that you never imagine. I give Moulin Rouge ***1/2 from ****.",10,0,1,6 September 2001
The Terminal," Highly warm and entertaining. Great option at the movies!
","The Terminal ***1/2 (out of four). I saw this film because i didn't found something more attractive at the theater's box office. I had seen the trailer before, and wasn't really much taken to see the film. But how big was my surprise! I definitively loved the movie! its really entertaining, it's been a while since I didn't had this much fun at the movies!!! Every thing starts when Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) a citizen from an eastern European country, arrives to the New York City Terminal and finds out that it has erupted a civil war in his homeland while he was in the air traveling to America, situation that left him off limits of the USA and not able to go back to his country, so this is how he becomes resident of the NYC Terminal. And although he doesn't speak a bit of English, he manages to keep it together and decides to wait for his permission to enter the States, and wait.... and wait! During this long wait of him, he meets the flight assistant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones) and quite interesting people from the airport staff which includes airport official Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), Joey Mulroy (Chi McBride), Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), Officer Ray Thurman (Barry Shabaka H.), Janitor Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and Officer Dolores Torres (Zoe Saldana). Every scene of the film we get to see great challenge situations for the pure hearted Viktor along with the rest of the characters (which felt that fitted perfectly in the story) and we really get to live that along with them.This warm and entertaining film's highly recommended and enjoyable for everyone. It may have some weak parts, but the whole final result will delight you! If you haven't seen it, this is your option at the multiplex in your next visit!!!",10,0,1,27 September 2004
