Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The guys sure can use computers, but . . .
","We took our little kids to the original trilogy: our 20-something daughter took us to Star Wars I. We liked various bits and pieces, but overall thought it was poorly written, very badly acted (or the actors were very badly directed), and way too artificially-generated. Yoda reminded me how really good Frank Oz is, and how 'human' puppets can be. The ethnic/racial stereotyping struck all of us, independently, as inappropriate. In fact, that was the first thing everyone mentioned as we left the theater. I wouldn't see it again, even on tape.",4,0,1,7 June 1999
Notting Hill," I liked the Junior Mints better
","Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were enough to make me *not* want to see this film, but the reviews overcame my judgement. Some funny bits and some good stage dressing were interspersed with endless vacuous smiles and abashedness. And the sound track added insult to stupefication. Rent 'Four Weddings' . . .",5,0,1,29 May 1999
The Matrix," Surprisingly cool
","Two Chosen Ones in one week! We saw The Matrix on Thursday and Star Wars I on Sunday. The Matrix was far the better film and the special effects, relying on people (if computer-enhanced) were much more 'real.' The ideas were maybe not very original, but the overall effect really pulled you into the action. Sure couldn't same the same for Lucas' attempt!",9,0,0,7 June 1999
