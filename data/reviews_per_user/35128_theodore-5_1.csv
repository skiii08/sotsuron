Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the great comedies
","This is the best comedy in the past 5 years or so. I'm pretty surprised that so many here are bashing it because, in their view, it's offensive. I don't think the movie actually targets any group (Christians, Nationalists, Southerners, Kazaks.) I think the target simply is people who take themselves too seriously. When an IMDb user gives one star to this movie, I get curious as to what comedies he/she loves. I encourage them to list the comedies they like. As for me:Spinal Tap South Park Monty Python ZoolanderThose are my favorites. Borat is up there with those greats.",10,2,4,12 January 2008
