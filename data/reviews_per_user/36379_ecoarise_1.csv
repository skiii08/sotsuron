The Lobster," brutal and nothing like the trailer
","The trailer made this look sort of funny and insightful, it was neither. This is a brutal, violent, horrible movie that wasted 2 hours of my time. AVOID at all costs! The acting is fair enough, the plot twist has potential, but in the end this just went nowhere. And the violence to animals, even though you know it's 'just a movie' left me heart broken and sad. I wish I had read more reviews before wasting my time, and I'm baffled that this gets a 7.1 currently (7/17). Seriously?!",1,5,6,18 July 2017
