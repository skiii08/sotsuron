Ghost," Absolutely Incredible
","I have watched this movie heaps of times, and I still love to watch it.  I liked it so much, I bought my own copy. The first time I watched it was when I went to the Video shop to get an action movie for myself, and a soppy one (Ghost) for my wife.  I watched it 3 times during that weekend.The directing was superb; the casting perfect and the acting out of this world.  I have never been moved by a film as I was by 'Ghost'.I like movies with a lot of action, you know guns, explosions, chase scenes etc, but when Demi said 'Ditto' near the end of the movie, I nearly lost it.If you have never seen this movie, or if you have not seen it for a while, watch it.  You will enjoy it.",10,5,6,28 December 2000
