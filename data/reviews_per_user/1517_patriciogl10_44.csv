First Man," The most tedious film I've seen in a while.
","When a film is not engaging me, I try to look for elements that I can underscore in order to find something of interest, or something I can highlight.
For this film, I had a very hard time doing that, because I felt it offered very little. The story, while a good one, felt dragged out a bit. The acting was lacklustre. I like Ryan Gosling but he was expressionless throughout the whole film. I couldn't capture any sort of emotion through his performance. And since we get to experience everything through his eyes as he is the sole focus, it completely diminishes the film in regards to its overall quality, its narrative, its pace and its emotional impact on the viewers, which it's real close to being none.The pace is too slow and unefficient, enough to make spectators repeatedly look at their watches, and so are the performances. They don't help at all. I'm sure we've all seen slow-paced films before but with such grand performances that could obviate that sense of tediousness.
I still think that La La Land is Chazelle's worst film, but First Man is second to that. He just wasn't able to recreate the success and unanimous praise he found with Whiplash.If I'm giving this a 6 rating, it's because of its technical aspects, which to me is the only part of this film that truly stands out.",6,1,2,25 September 2019
Walk the Line," This is how biopics should be made.
","Not only is Johnny Cash's personal and public story a captivating one, but also this biopic wonderfully manages to capture that true essence of a man who was very distinctive in style and voice. Joaquin Phoenix cleverly approached this difficult role in a manner no one but him could have done. The circumstances which surrounded both Johnny and Joaquin dealt with tragic losses of family members, so Joaquin knew a thing or two about how to convey Johnny's tortured soul. But Phoenix is only half of this film, the other is Reese Whiterspoon playing his wife and partner, June Carter Cash, in an incomparable performance, completely worthy of her Oscar win.A very truthful portrait of Johnny Cash's life and her romantic story with June Carter, not only shown through dialogue but also in musical performances where they both do justice to the original interpreters, of course Joaquin and Reese sing with their own voice which is always a huge merit and specially when done right as they did.Definitely one of the best biopics out there, if you haven't seen it's a must.",9,1,1,21 December 2019
Hereditary," First and second act are excellent, then in the third a totally average disposable horror garbage appeared.
","Hereditary, a film that could have been so much and ended up being just fairly good. Let's see, the first and second act are marevellous, taking the viewer through sheer excruciating pain and grief through the eyes of a very emotionally beaten-up family working their way through tragedy and how to deal with their lives after such scarring events. The acting is top-notch, Toni Collette and Alex Wolff absolutely steal the show, they deliver such powerful outstanding performances, definitely award-worthy.I was excited to see this movie, but the actual movie lies in the build-up towards the climax, and not including the climax itself, which it was so ordinary and reminiscent of typical horror nonsense you see nowadays; so utterly disappointing. A family drama with a horror undercurrent that keeps you enthralling with only subtle frightening suggestions; for such a great build up I was waiting for the ending to blow me away, and to my utter disappointment it didn't. It felt like I was watching a completely different movie, that is, a mediocre one. I just couldn't keep my eyes from rolling at such a cheap ending. However, I cannot be unfair with what came before and it definitely felt to me like one of the best horror films of this decade. I sincerely don't know how you are going to feel after watching this movie, like me perhaps, amazed and disillusioned at the same time; I get the feeling that a lot of people felt ripped off, not only by the ending like me considering everything it preceded, but also by the fact that is not a conventional horror movie with plenty of cheap scare jumps and nonsensical plots. Yet, is this unconventionality is what made it great in the first place in my opinion.I gotta hand it to the score, I can't remember such an infectious and unsettling piece of music belonging to a horror movie in recent years that was so attached to the plot, the characters and the overall atmosphere and 
tone of the film. Simply superb. Had me feeling uncomfortable during the entire movie.So there you have it, a film that could have been excellent, but instead decided to crush my high expectations that were built during the course of the film, which is what annoys me the most; the film itself raised the bar and lowered it destroying what was previously built so well. Still, a decent film; I urge you, don't miss out on this one! You may feel different than me.",7,1,5,11 September 2018
Rocketman," Solid and fresh.
","So many biopics that follow the same formulaic way of telling an artist's life story end up leaving a sense of grotesque coarseness after watching them. It's high time a biopic production took some risks in order to tell a story in a more creative fashion. Essentially, Rocketman, deals with the beginnings of Elton John's career, browsing through the most well-known songs of his catalogue in musical form. Not only do the songs play in the background as part of the soundtrack but are also performed in the narrative context by most of the cast and extras. So, most of the songs are in fact musical numbers with a touch of fantasy as it comes from Elton John's flamboyant way of processing everything around him.Taron Egerton brilliantly shines in his grandiose performance; not only taking center stage but also sharing the spotlight with the rest of the cast, complementing each other fantastically. Vocally, he was impressive in his delivery; not mimicking Elton but imposing his own style without altering what essentially makes Elton John sound like Elton John; Egerton's approach proved to be very fruitful, enhancing not only his overall performance but also the quality of the musical renditions and the film itself.Special mentions to Bryce Dallas Howard and Jamie Bell's portrayals, which are quite levelled up to Egerton's although in a smaller proportion.
An authentic portrait of an extravagant individual and his striking lifestyle, also his lucid relationship with his songwriting partner, which takes up a great part of the film's content. This is a great biopic, I urge you to watch it.",8,3,4,7 November 2019
A Star Is Born," Great renewed old story.
","There's already too many reviews on this film so I'm going to keep this short. A Star is Born 2018 version is perhaps the most popular of them all, because it represents our current times, while still respecting previous versions. It doesn't mean it's better, but it is still a fine effort. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's chemistry is undeniable, so much that it even trascended the screen. Their musical performances are quite good, although nothing really spectacular, but I must say I was truly impressed with 'Shallow' and 'I'll Never Love Again', two great songs that will be remembered for years to come.If you haven't seen it, break yourself free from all you read about this film and just experience it for yourself. My guess is that if you enjoy music, romance and drama or are familiar with the story, you will like Bradley Cooper's A Star is Born.",8,1,2,22 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Don't be biased. Judge independently.
","I refuse to be that guy, like thousand others on this site by being biased, writing reviews that condemn this film and Brie Larson just because of her remarks regarding white men. How fragile must your integrity be if you're offended by something an actress legimately said? Were men really that hurt by some comment? Even if it is true, one certainly should not alter negatively the way of judging a film. Captain Marvel deals wih a woman becoming a superhero, perhaps the strongest, so obviously it is going to portray a powerful female, like many other classics there have always been powerful women, although not nearly enough, so hopefully cinema will take this matter into an even more favourable direction in the near future.Having said that, I honestly believe we were mislead into thinking this was critical to watch before Endgame, and perhaps is not quite like that.
Sure, it introduces a hero that took part in major events in Endgame, but since Captain Marvel is a new character to the eyes of the Avengers, she is also going to be introduced in that world, less personally of course. The point is that you can actually do without this film and still understand Captain Marvel's role in the aforementioned film. That feels like a huge setback in the very existence of this film, as it doesn't feel crucial within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, just like Black Panther, and it shouldn't be that way. Every hero should have a decent film portraying their grandness and doing justice to their printed counterparts.Captain Marvel lacks in depth; the dialogue denotes an unbearably bland, poorly written script. As a result, neither Larson nor Jackson are able to barely pass for average performances and that is why this film will be lost in oblivion. The Skrull design is actually really good, being one of the few remarkable things about this film, the other being Goose, the Flerken, a really powerful creature that looks identically like cats on Earth.Should you watch this movie? Yeah, why not? Form your own opinion on it, and if you are like me, you wouldn't like to leave loose ends on such an overarching large-scale story like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Is it absolutely necessary to understand what comes next? Not really.",6,1,6,27 November 2019
The Irishman," Outstanding narrative feat.
","One of the longest awaited releases in recent memory, The Irishman is Marty Scorsese's mob magnus opus of this decade, something that was long overdue, not to mention him joining forces once again with former associates such as Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Harvey Keitel and first-time
collaborator, the magnificent Al Pacino. Scorsese returns to the genre in top form, handling narrative tasks in an extremely substantial manner, with minutious precise storytelling that seems so well-connected from beginning to end. Each scene is composed through a firm thread which stays strong throughout the film, never letting any scene go unnoticed or feel somewhat unremarkable. Each scene has its purpose, whether it is small or big, it ties the story together. The editing is also a marvel to behold, since it brings the narrative element to the highest of standards, prompting to make the viewer feel that the duration of the film isn't something to be preoccupied with as long as there is an excellent film in front of them. The film slowly cooks on low heat like a stew, slowly building up to the point of being done, and the final result is an absolute delight, a feast to the senses involved.The acting is first-class, supreme and superlative, as if there weren't enough adjectives to describe the immaculate performances of De Niro, Pesci and Pacino. Even the rest of the cast does a magnific job to keep the boat not only afloat but almost floating up in the air. The only thing that results a bit distracting is the de-aging effect, specially on De Niro, just like Will Smith on Gemini Man, specifically the area around the mouth, which is something special effects companies will have to improve to make it as close to reality as possible.Marty Scorsese and his friends came back for a monumental mob/political piece regarding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa, proving that the Scorsese way is still efficient and highly regarded in 2019, where people can still appreciate movies of long duration, with nothing but a story to tell, supported by fine acting, and almost zero effects. The Irishman will only get bigger with time, as it will be regarded as one of Scorsese's finest works of his career, accumulated with efforts of such exceptional quality.

Billy Elliot," Brilliantly honest.
","What can I say? This film is a beautiful, passionate project built with heart and honesty. It is not solely focused on the human aspect but there are also political undertones that help shape the troubling context Billy Elliot is set in. Billy is played brilliantly by Jamie Bell, who like any of us, merely starts observing something out of curiosity and slowly feels that electrifying spark that ignites our interests and turns them to passion for something. His passion for dancing, is somehow frawned upon by conventional society, and specially those close to Billy, like his father and brother.Being a young boy, is hard to go against his father in pursuit of what he really loves doing, so to help him smooth things out is his dancing teacher, so convincingly played by Julie Walters. The film is stunningly shot, so straightforward and transparent, almost exuding sincerity.Not only does it shine in terms of what it evokes but also how Billy's own struggle is shown. He's a troubled boy because he is not allowed to pursue his dreams, he wants to dance because that's what makes him feel alive and talented, as he becomes great at it.A truly inspirational film, with a story destined to move you through its journey and resolution.",8,0,0,26 November 2019
Blade," You actually could make decent comic book movies back in the 90s.
","Blade is probably the only interesting production adapted from a comic book of the 90s. It's faithful to its original source material, it's not overdone, nor it tries to overcompensate with awful CGI, the acting is great, the fighting sequences are well done, it's an intriguing story, Deacon Frost may not be the greatest villain, but he is acceptable, Stephen Dorff managed to inject a determined and menacing personality that brought life to the character.Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, well, it certainly feels that way, because he does such a terrific job that you cannot imagine someone else in the role. Sometimes he acts apathetically but he has so much passion for those he protects and you can see that through his actions, not his words. A great vampire film, an even greater comic book adaptation, lots of action, blood, fighting. The film is highly entertaining.Watch and you'll see.",8,1,1,21 November 2019
Rise of the Guardians," A wonderful animated film.
","What a ride this movie was. I honestly didn't know what to expect and I ended up quite surprised at how good it was. So, we got all these childhood icons thrown into an beautifully animated movie, filled with emotion that reaches epic proportions. I still feel this film as somewhat underrated; yet it has plenty of well-rounded characters purposefully adapted to the film's tone. Santa Claus (North) is portrayed as a badass Russian fellow, a reimagination which serves the movie pretty well in my opinion.The plot is thoroughly entertaining, reaching a wonderful climax that will satisfy the viewer's appetite for great stories with happy endings. You may say it's a bit predictable, but what is entertaining is the ride, not the destination in itself alone. Seriously, this one is not to be missed! The plot, the characters, the visuals, the beautiful score all construct this truly enjoyable animated piece.",9,0,0,23 February 2019
The Hustler," More than just a movie about pool.
","Yes, a film about pool, but not in the traditional sense you might be thinking of. The movie's title helps with the understanding of the context a bit.
We have a pool player, Fast Eddie Nelson (Paul Newman) who is a hustler, and has a manager who helps him conducting his schemes. A post-WWII America, shown in this particular context as a somewhat bleak scenario, in the gritty underground pool scene where only bitter men reside.
We are introduced to more characters worthy of mentioning like Minnesota Fats, the reigning champion and best pool player in town, practically unbeateable, the tragic Sarah (Piper Laurie) who is Eddie's drunken girlfriend. George C. Scott plays Bert Gordon, who intends to act as Eddie's manager in order to get money out of him, out of his remarkable talent as a pool player.Eddie is young, talented, arrogant and naive, all at the same time; and sometimes he doesn't even know what to do with himself. He leads such an
one dimensional life, revolving around whatever he can get around his hustling schemes, and sometimes spending low quality time with his girlfriend or other associates. We could argue that their lives are heavily miserable; Eddie is a talented loser, he isn't smart enough to use his talents through different means or in more appropriate environments.It is a more than interesting character study, a film to analyze profundly in its entirety, filled with deep, intense and acute social commentary.
Pretty much everyone acting-wise gives their very best, channeling their conflicted emotions of self-destruction by means of sincere and heart-rending portrayals.The Hustler is so much more than just a film about pool. It's about wasting life away, having a gift and succumb to cheap trickery in order to make a buck. A dissatisfying grim road to wander one's life through, and these actors play that perfectly. A must-see.",8,2,2,14 December 2019
Terminator Salvation," A fairly dim portrayal of a Terminator story.
","What I find interesting and appealing about this film is its tone, regarding both plot and color palette, which defines a more gritty ambience imbued with hopelessness and a distinct dystopian feel.Sam Worthington contributes with a correct performance, Anton Yelchin is fantastic as a young rebellious Kyle Reese. And that leaves us with Christian Bale delivering John Connor in a deficient and poor manner. I find him inadequate for the role, he failed to transmit anything the character is known for. He has a problem with properly conveying a well-known character convincingly. I will say though, that he is better as John Connor than he is Bruce Wayne/Batman where is performance is truly abysmal.Besides that and some obvious plot issues, something which affects the majority of Terminator films, Salvation still manages to get pass all that to be seen as an acceptable form of entertainment, a Terminator film with a more distinctive setting and atmosphere, which definitely brings something a bit different to the table.",6,0,0,16 December 2019
Aquaman," I liked it, but I know it could have been so much better.
","To this day, the best movie DCEU has provided it is still Wonder Woman. Aquaman falls into a second place, it is mainly a decent film with several flaws. I can't get over the fact of how dreadful the CGI is. I mean, I can understand that in the DCU's first movie they may not get it right, but after several releases and millions of viewers complaining about that same aspect, why wouldn't they try to improve it? Aquaman fails to deliver a believable proportion of action and visual effects, in terms of how realistically they should go together. Black Manta was such a weak rival, poorly acted, unlike the rest of the cast whom I thought did a pretty good job. Jason Momoa is fantastic as the titular character; Amber Heard and WIlliam Dafoe properly delivered Mera and Vulko; Nicole Kidman was fairly good in her portrayal of Atlanna; and Patrick Wilson did a phenomenal task in giving life to King Orm. Some visuals were cool, some of the music was not (Pitbull); the scene in Italy was fantastic, I had a blast watching that.I am almost certain that if the CGI had been great, it would have changed my vision regarding the picture as a whole, but to me it was entertaining nonetheless. The cast is what does it for me, the story could have been a lot better, or it could have been executed in a more non-generic fashion. I have to give it to Jason Momoa, from the moment he was cast we all knew he had a difficult task in playing a superhero that has been a laughing stock for decades, and yet he made Aquaman cool for nearly everyone! Although, the Arthur Curry from the DC Animated Universe is badass as well. Decent effort from DCEU, but I expect much more, as I'm sure many other fans do too.",7,0,1,19 April 2019
Ready Player One," Even more fun than an actual rollercoaster ride.
","I was taken aback by this film. I had low expectations yet a keen attitude to watch it because of Mr. Spielberg. What first strikes you like a boxer's punch is the outstanding visual aesthetic and the incredible blend of animation and reality. This is how CGI should be used and applied; the merge is flawlessly seamless. The amount of easter eggs is astounding, and you actually enjoy yourself while spotting them. When you know you are getting a whole lot of pop culture references you keep an eye on every detail possible, so I believe that enriches the viewing experience.The direction is impecable; while this is an effort far from Spielberg's usuals it is still very Spielberg-esque in pretty much every aspect you can think of. I'm really glad he is still making great action adventure films like he used to; but now with the added dimension of being modern and even more spectacular in scale, with a strong nostalgic hint, product of what Spielberg's figure represents. The story is remarkably fun, and engaging all the way; Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke prove to be a fairly good pairing that slowly develop a chemistry greatly supplied to the screen. Ben Mendelsohn strikes hard yet again with a fabulous villainous turn as the corporate boss who hunts down players in order to seek the Easter Egg for himself.Ready Player One is an electrifying rollercoaster ride embedded with a factory of allusions to the entertainment culture which is ten times more exciting than an actual rollercoaster ride, but with a Spielberg signature at the end.",10,0,1,5 November 2019
Elf," Classic Christmas spirit.
","This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It's a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn't got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director's chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that.",7,11,11,3 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Don't believe the 1s nor the 10s.
","First off, is by no means a bad  film, sure it's flawed mostly from a story point of view, which is where most fans attack this film. Despite some inconsistencies within the framework of the story's saga, I recall some unexplained elements from the first trilogy and none of these fans are nitpicking like they do with these films, purely because most of them saw them when they were kids/teenagers and were so enthralled by them that they omit some of these 'flaws'. My point is that it is almost as if they want to hate the sequel trilogy for whatever reason, minutiously ripping every small detail to shreds without giving it the slightest chance. The 1, 2 or 3 star ratings are absolutely disgraceful, as they only increase the poor conception this trilogy has without actually being deserving of such shaming.
These whiny fans seem like they want to have everything served in a silver platter, asking for huge send-offs with big pompous displays to major characters but it is not always the case to do that, nor it should be. This film already gives much fan-service so as to please every generation but it is still impossible to satisfy every single viewer.Having covered the disruptive venom toxic fandom spreads, I would say The Rise of Skywalker is arguably the better one from the whole trilogy. But first some displeasing aspects: some jokes and one-liners are oddly placed, and seem rather forced instead of coming up with more clever ways to throw them in. Some clichÃ© 'Disney moments' also appear in many parts of the film but for some reason are a bit cringe-worthy, perhaps not coming off as sincere as one would expect, which is a bit detrimental to the nurturing essence of togetherness, hope and fellowship heavily present in the first trilogy.In the acting spectrum, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver make up for the pairing with most given screen time, mainly because they both represent good and evil, Jedi and Sith, and they are both inevitably fearful of and torn between switching to the other side, which is a fantastic dynamic in my book. They both give great performances, that suit the bond they have created with one another.The most impressive aspect is its visual setting, and the well-crafted CGI, which proves that in that department, these are definitely great times for Star Wars films being made. There are some exquisite shots that could delight even some of the most die-hard fans of the franchise.When it comes to action and fighting choreographies, the stunts are fairly good, although nothing truly spectacular, which is a shame, because great efforts could be done in order to achieve something truly majestic and of a more enduring quality.I won't get into plot details or issues, I will leave that to your own discovery, all I will say is that I hope future Star Wars installments don't suffer the fierceful and unjust scrutiny and tiresome comparisons these films had. Although I understand the comparisons to some extent because it is the sequel to the original story, but enough already, when does it end? It's extremely hard to live up to such a glorious cinematic achievement and cultural global phenomenon as it is, so newer films should be viewed and analyze under their own light so that they don't become a mere shadow of the original, or maybe even less. We have to give them a chance to stand on their own.The Rise of Skywalker might not be the best SW film, but it is definitively an entertaining one, and the closing chapter of the mighty saga that has enamoured million fans all over the world. I believe this film will gain more acceptance as the years pass by. Or at least I hope so, because it would be a step forward.",7,0,2,24 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Rami Malek and Queen's timeless music.
","I have the feeling many moviegoers have been surpassed by the infectious and overwhelming nostalgia that seems to take over and obscure an objetive judgement of the film. While it is not nowhere near a masterpiece, it isn't bad either. It is an acceptable portrayal of the band's history leading up to their legendary Live Aid concert.
The physical resemblance of May, Taylor and Deacon are spot on. Rami Malek sort of lacks the uncanny resemblance but he makes up for it with his enormous acting, through his gaze, mannerisms and vocal inflection. He gave
such an exceptional performance which is without a doubt the highlight of the film, along with the final scene. One could say that those two elements carry the movie's weight on their shoulders, because without them, the film would definitely be of average quality.The way the filmmakers depicted Freddie's sexuality was okay, I mean obviously they played it safe, because this is a filmic representation of the band, properly supervised by Queen's actual members Brian May and Roger Taylor so, a daring version of the late singer's life story would have been out of the question (many would have preferred Sascha Baron Cohen's version instead). Still that wouldn't have ensured us a tasteful handling of his personal life. Nevertheless, I actually enjoyed the film, and I'm not entirely sure what percentage of my view on it was biased by the nostalgia factor, but I can safely say the majority of Queen fans will have a blast with this film and will undoubtedly praise Rami Malek's outstanding performance, along with the Live Aid concert scene, which is shot properly and creatively, hence why is one of the better parts of the film, and of course it contains the music of Queen, which of course, is one of the most important aspects of this effort.",7,2,2,16 February 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Arguably the better one amongst a string of failed offerings.
","I honestly believe this third Terminator entry has been unjustly critized and hated, for when you really think about it, it's not as bad a lot of people make it out to be. I can even go further by saying it's probably the better film out of Salvation and Genisys, and many would agree.
Most problems lie with the specifics surrounding the storyline, which hits many bumps along the way and does nothing to straighten them out, that is why in the third act you sort of see the cracks and plotholes become more evident as it gets near the end.Still, there's a heavily enjoyable aspect coming from the side of the entertaining action, featuring a well-done car chase sequence that could put
other generic car chases to shame. In the acting department, Arnold still does his thing we know so well; Nick Stahl proves himself worthy as a cowardly but intuitive John Connor, who doesn't know what the future holds for him; Claire Danes wonderfully serves as a natural complement to Connor: strong, smart and efficient.
Good call on the casting director to recruit actors who's forte doesn't rely on action nor science fiction, it turned out incredibly well. Kristanna Lokken is a formidable T-X model, inspiring menacing fear to each of the human characters involved.I suggest you give this one another go, and embrace it for what it is, an acceptable follow-up to the best Terminator film ever.",7,2,2,13 December 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," A Spider-Verse you'll never forget.
","What a splendid visual spectacle this film has to offer. Full of colour and imbued with an enormous inspired sense of creativity and craftsmanship.
Not only that but it also presents a very distinctive representation of our friendly neighbor, in fact several, coming from different universes. The
different Spider-people collide into an amazing mixture and variety of character stylization that pushes the film rapidly foward, along with its strikingly powerful visuals. The story doesn't detract from the film's highest points, but aids them as if it was a secondary element. This is actually good because its aesthetic is so blatanly in-your-face that one can't help to let it sweep you away and leave you in awe. So, the plot continues its course naturally with flow and succeeds in telling its story thanks to innovative narrative techniques.So, it basically has every point checked at its favour, so immerse yourself into this wonderful world created and inspired by wonderful artists.",10,0,1,13 December 2019
Duck Soup," Part of history.
","Whether you like them or not, it's an undeniable fact that the Marx Brothers are part of cinematic and comedy history. That surely doesn't mean that they were perfect, but they were talented and their films emanated creativity with impressive stunts, ingenious gags and highly entertaining musical numbers. While Duck Soup's plot is something obviously built for comedy, it's somewhat exaggerated or rather the played down tone on politics, funnily enough, enhances the viewing experience. There's just something so exhilirating about watching a politician being portrayed as a buffoon, and perhaps oddly satisfying. It's a genious satire that begs to be further analyzed in retrospective, and a bit sad to see that not much has changed since the old days.The absolute highlight is the mirror scene, I would recommend anyone to watch this movie just because of that scene. I wouldn't recommend watching the scene in isolation because it's better when you understand the whole context, the payoff is way better. It is one of the most accomplished comedic scenes in the history of cinema, without a shred of doubt. Extremely well-crafted and wonderfully executed, the film is also notable for having a wonderful sense of comedic timing and delivery from dialogues that are remarkable still to this day.I must say I particularly didn't enjoy much of Harpo Marx's interventions, there's something about him that just throws me off.Anyway, when you watch this film you will know exactly how the Marx Brothers skillfully operated just to make people laugh. And boy do they have much more in store for you.",8,1,2,30 November 2019
Yesterday," One of the most inventive plots in recent years.
","Just by reading the plot you immediately raise an eyebrow in sign of interest. However unsure of how ultimately the effort will result, I went in with a small percentage of engagement and felt that the story was rightfully executed and with a proper hint of sensitivity. A struggling musician suffers an accident and after that he realizes that no one but him has ever heard of The Beatles, which at first he thought was some sort of an elaborate prank but when he actually did some research online discovered the awful reality. Not only are The Beatles missing but some other big names like Coca-Cola. So as he was living in humiliating conditions as a musician he decides to start playing Beatles songs and make them pass as his own, which takes him to stardom.At some point one inevitably tries to figure out where the story is going to go, but I was unsure how everything was going to play out in the case of this film, which made it much more intriguing and engaging. Himesh Patel fantastically executes Beatles' tunes and give them his own spin which is always refreshing and much more fitting for the film.A truly exciting and original film that flew under the radar. Hopefully in a few years it gets the credit it truly deserves.",7,0,0,21 December 2019
Flashdance," A great '80s film.
","Flashdance is a good film, carried almost entirely by Jennifer Beals acting performance and dancing performance. Despite these acts being the central appeal of the film, there is also a nice story set to serve as context that encourages the pursuit of dreams, in spite of reality constantly knocking on the door. It was a daring move to showcase a female steel worker moonlighting as an exotic dancer, it was courageous to show a female lead working to jobs on her own, with no male support whatsover, she's her own woman. Adrian Lyne has always portrayed smart,
determined and brave women in his films, Jennifer Beals' Alex Owens being one of his firsts.Primarily known for its dance audition scene, along with some exotic dance scenes famously displayed in Irene Cara's What a Feeling music video, although this film is much more than just dancing, it's about the passion of it, giving all that it takes to make it professionally, to have a unique opportunity and seize it, about standing up on your own two feet and chasing your dreams.It highly evokes nostalgia, because it screams 80s, that's why is so enjoyable, apart from the dancing. So revisit, re-live it, or watch it if you haven't, I wouldn't call this a classic but it's a well-known '80s movie that deserves to be seen.",8,1,1,4 December 2019
Toy Story 4," Mature compared to previous films, but nowhere near as good.
","Perhaps Toy Story 4 is the most mature of the films in the franchise. The best is still Toy Story 3, it is unmatchable. But Toy Story 4 has it's many points to its favour. The animation gets increasingly better, reaching an outstanding level of quality, you can see that on the very first scene of the film. Great mix between old returning characters and newly created ones, the chemistry between them all was flowing very smoothly throughout the movie. There were plenty of adventure sequences that were fun to watch, and some that were not that much. Probably one of the most grabbing sequences of the film is most of what goes on in the antique store. Creepy elements emerge as to throw a different vibe, and done it successfully as the new villains seem quite frightening, much like Sid and his monstruous 'spider baby' toy.The most tear-jerking moment comes at the key scene near the end, that will change everything that was pre established by earlier films. The problem arises with too much focus on Woody, Forky and Bo, leaving practically no screen time for the rest of our beloved characters. It doesn't feel like an honest and deserving send-off to them, which makes me question the very existence of this film, because they reached perfection in Toy Story 3, which cannot be surpassed, and if anything, anything that comes after it was going to be disappointing because the bar was set up really high.It is still a good Toy Story film if you look at it objectively, but not as good, entertaining or emotionally cohesive as the ones that came before.",7,1,1,19 December 2019
The Favourite," Impactful.
","Yorgos Lanthimos is a unique filmmaker and he proves this film after film. His style is surrounded by ethereal and almost surreal passages, unconventional and somewhat unorthodox storytelling, distinctive camera techniques that allude to certain narrative moments in film. For example, the use of fish-eye lenses in The Favourite, which brings a distorted image of the protagonists, leading to the notion of emotional instability and disruptiveness. The film counts with three leading ladies, all of whom are exceptionally brilliant in their performances, specially Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz (her portrayal gave me chills). The acting definitely feels much more vivid and much less monotonous in comparison to Lanthimos' previous films such as The Lobster, which makes it more accessible for people unfamiliar with his work. Having said that, The Favourite still contains elements that may cause casual viewers to shy away from this effort, most notably its dark humour, its remarkable use of natural light, along with meticulous photographic compositions that inevitably make The Favourite a painstakingly elaborate feature, an artistical product that even with that ultra-careful attention to composition details can make unfamiliar spectators feel uneasy and slightly disturbed.That is how Lanthimos' film aesthetic works, he uses any element at his reach to provoke and disturb filmgoers, and he achieves this with this film, although to a much lesser extent than his previous works. Undoubtedly this has had mixed opinions, and with absolute reason, but I have to add, that to understand pretty much every aspect of this film (dialogue, acting, camera movements; lenses; techniques, aesthetic, themes) you have to be a bit familiar with the director's work, so that you won't easily disregard this film for its unusual approach, because I'm sure most viewers would expect a simple take on a period piece, but this is much more than that, so much more. And do you know why? His name is Yorgos Lanthimos.",8,3,6,14 November 2019
Bolt," Some dynamics are annoying, yet it is a considerable effort.
","Bolt is a film of wonderful high quality visuals and an entertaining story that doesn't fail to captivate even the most uninterested viewer out there.
Although met with flaws, it is a pleasant ride that ultimately delivers an entertaining product. Particularly I find sometimes tiring and must add eye-rolling to see the typical boring way to portray dogs as good and cat as evil or mischeavous; it's been done to death, it can frankly be a bit tedious to insist on that absurd rivalry. Nowadays you don't really see that kind of repetitive dynamic recklessly thrown into a movie plot, fresh ideas were desperately needed in order to turn around animated films depicting animals as characters. Luckily animated films have come a long way since movies like Bolt and of course there were a few at the time that pursued other interests as well.Having said that, Bolt still managed to feel pleasing to watch on an undemanding afternoon.",7,0,0,23 November 2019
Ghostbusters," Never has been a movie premise so perfectly encapsulated in its title.
","Turns out I watched this again some time ago, and I literally had fun like it was my first viewing. Ghostbusters is a classic that no matter how many times you've watch it, and know all the lines, it still somehow feels fresh and full of genuine charm. Sure most of its special effects are incredibly dated, but they are also part of the allure. We cannot take the nostalgia factor out of the equation, since it irrevocably appeals to us in that vein.Full of iconic scenes, costumes, dialogues, lines, special effects, the giant Marshmallow Man, and even the Ghostbusters logo have managed to remain in people's collective memory since the year it premiered. Not many motion pictures can do that, so with that in mind, it's really important to get a proper perspective of the film to truly appreciate it. And then, when you watch it, you absolutely understand the magic behind it.",8,0,0,9 October 2019
1917," A POV cinematic experience.
","Even if you aren't into war films, 1917 is a film one must experience, because there is a simple story, sufficient and efficient, backed by an extraordinary technical accomplishment, which pretty much shapes and enlarges the cinematic experience to the highest degree. The pace just flows flawlessly frame after frame; to me it was intoxicating to have such a personal point of view, it certainly enriched the momentum, it made everything feel more tense, up close yet distant. I was very eager to see what would happen next and how the story would ultimately unfold. We don't get to see the known horrors of war in a crude fashion as it wasn't intended, but we get to witness glimpses of hope and tenderness which add to the emotional impact of the film. And I have to say those moments are necessary because something else is needed besides the constant suspense and continuous turbulent path towards the success of the corporates' mission, otherwise it's hard to feel something for these characters, given that it takes place in a constricted time frame and with a clear objective, that it doesn't leave much room for a film's usual way of progressing.The plot involves a race against time, the context is set, the story is rather simplistic, so the technical aspect is where the strength of the narrative lies. Sam Mendes and his crew were fully aware that they needed a particular way to tell their story so that it would enhance what these young soldiers had to go through by carrying out such a difficult undertaking.1917 is a phenomenal film, with much of its grandness being granted by its technical resources rather than its story itself; so, without its practical prowess would it still be an excellent film? I dare to say that it would not, perhaps it would be a good film, but not an excellent one. The premise isn't lacking in merit, but a film that spans across such a limited time frame can be somewhat difficult to handle regarding certain elements like character development (not that it matters at all in this film), emotional investment and an in-depth plot progress. And on top of all to make it as if it was one long continuous shot is an incredibly hard feat to achieve, but done excellently and cohesively in 1917.Whether you enjoy these type of films or not, whether you heard great things about it or that is overrated, it doesn't matter. Just watch the film and see what everyone else is talking about.",9,0,0,20 February 2020
A Bug's Life," You are in for a treat.
","Is this perhaps the most underrated Pixar film to date? It could be, let's see: it's super entertaining, it has funny moments, creative bits of action and also small tender parts. The characters were built to know their place in this film, which in my personal view I would describe its plot as an 'adaptation' (quote unquote because unofficially it is not) of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954), for they both consist of a small village or colony being subjugated by invaders demanding food during each invasion, but placed in a world of an animated colony of ants; so the protagonist, Flik, comes up with a great idea, to search for a group of 'warrior' bugs (they are in fact members of a circus) to help them defeat the invaders, a group of malicious grasshoppers whose leader may be one of the best villains Pixar's creative team has ever offered, the evil Hopper. This movie also subtly touches the idea of revolution, as the ants ultimately wish to eradicate their raiders in order to live life peacefully. Another thing worth mentioning is the clever way in which they decide to deal with the grasshoppers, and although it is met with an unfortunate mishap, the denouement of the film is utterly satisfying, just wait and see if you haven't already! 
Oh, and the outtakes at the end of the movie are really ingenious and creative, not to mention funny! A great adventure that I would watch many many times, but I feel that with so many excellent films that Pixar has provided the public over the years this one may not rank as high as many others, which is why I believe that is somewhat underrated.",9,3,3,20 August 2018
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," It's not what you expect. It's so much more.
","What a brilliant fantastic film. What a character Hedwig is! So flamboyant, interesting, damaged, hurt, vulnerable and invulnerable at the same time. Her story is wonderful, simple and compelling. I was truly fascinated, the songs are marvelous. The audience resist her to a certain extent yet can't seem to stop listening to what she has to say, or better yet, sing. Her attitude towards her art is enviable; her life story flows effortlessly through her songwriting. And her rivalry with Tommy Gnosis tells us how much she's been hurt by him, and some flashback scenes tell us more about their true relationship, and how she changed him.Apart from the character, John Cameron Mitchell crafted this amazing musical filled with songs from diverse genres. Standouts for me are Sugar Daddy, Origin of Love and the incendiary Angry Inch, which could be a punk anthem, it's an amazing song. What is great about Hedwig is that despite her diva antics, you are actually able to simpathize with her at a human level. She's flawed and you feel not only for her but also with her.
This sparks genuineness amongst the viewers who feel such an authentic piece of work unravel through music and fantastic performances. There is so much analysis one can go through by watching this film and listening to the songs, so it provokes deep thought as well.All in all, John Cameron Mitchell created an extraordinary work of art that sadly doesn't get the recognition it deserves, but from the many reviews in here, you can tell it is something really special. Dare to watch it.",9,1,1,11 May 2019
"Girl, Interrupted"," Forgot how good this was.
","I found this film browsing through Netflix's deplorable movie catalogue, and couldn't figure out when did I watched it some time ago. Utterly enjoyable all the way through, I was delighted by Angelina Jolie's performance, I hadn't even remembered she won an Oscar for it, it wasn't until near the end that it hit me. Her performance is truly astounding, she composes her character with traits that perfectly define a person with her mental state. Her mannerisms, her volatile and somewhat unpredictable self makes her a bit frightening, which makes the viewer watch her performance uncomfortable and in awe at the same time.Winona Ryder is great as well, she portrays her different condition in a different manner as expected, perhaps more discreetly, but still effective nonetheless. Overall, most acting performances are on point, such as Clea DuVall, the late Brittany Murphy, Whoopi Goldberg and Elisabeth Moss, they all deserved to be credited.If you want well-done drama with splendid performances, look no further, and enjoy yourself. Especially Angelina Jolie's phenomenal Oscar-winning performance.",8,6,6,4 December 2019
Midsommar," A peculiar yet great film.
","To be honest, I had my reservations before watching this film, as I read some comments online and heard mostly negative things about it. The slow pace mistakingly perceived as 'boring', the plot being weird and bizzarre, amongst other negative remarks. The film indeed starts slow, but it has to build a story, its characters and everything that drives and motivates them. Dani, the main character (played by a magnificent Florence Pugh) is concerned with her sister's state of mind, as she is not responding messages which keeps Dani upset, having only her boyfriend to rely on, who thinks Dani's sister is being dramatic as she always is. Shocking news come Dani's way as she learns about the decease of her sister and her parents in a strange episode never truly revealed on dialogue. Her boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) and his friends are planning a trip to Sweden, to one of the friends' (Pelle, Vilhem Blomgren) village, where everybody is set to celebrate a midsummer festival which takes place once in a lifetime.The Swedish villagers take part in rather strange and morbid rituals which in their eyes are seen as traditional costumes which have been carried out for many many years. Situations take an even more bizarre turn with some members of Dani and Christian's friends begin to disappear, and from then the narrative takes the viewer through a spiralling down of grotesque scenarios evidently crafted in order to shock and disturb the audience.Ari Aster knew he didn't want to make just an average conventional horror film, so he used many resources at hand to excel in a genre that often gets depreciated because the lack of quality efforts being put out every year. These filmmaking resources include unusual long takes, sometimes without close-up shots, only long shots or american shots, which gives the film its own distinctive style, combined with the daytime photography which is absolutely breathtaking. Not many films can pull off perturbing and distressing an audience without the always helpful aid of nightime.These technical tools elevate the quality of the narrative and storytelling, which flows naturally without hurry, taking its time to truly develop cohesively and coherently. Events unfold into aberrant situations such as procreational sex with harmonized moans as part of a fertility ritual to name one. The experience is truly unsettling, an uncomfortable watch that challenges viewers' perception on the abnormal ways of these Swedish villagers, as opposed to what a normal civilization accepts as normal behaviour.I enjoyed the film, and certainly had a much fitting closure than Ari Aster's previous film Hereditary, which in my personal view was completely off in regards to what came before. Midsommar is an unusual film, with a distinctive directorial style and filmmaking techniques that embellish the final product, which is essentially great, yet misunderstood.",8,2,4,1 January 2020
The King," We need more period pieces these days.
","If you have a problem with historical inaccuracy, just straight out avoid this film. Having said that, The King is a valid fictitious portrait of actual historic events and lives such as that of Henry V, appreciably portrayed by Timothée Chalamet, in a correct performance that doesn't strike at first but slowly begins to entice. Historical subject matter is dealt with care and attention to details, minus some historical facts which history buffs are not even done complaining about.When I was watching the film, it felt slow and tedious in some moments, unable to grab my attention to its full extent. The pacing can be quite damaging to this film, although it's easy to confuse slow pacing with slow tension-building moments, which are done purposefully to generate impact at certain points in the film.Perhaps you could compare this film with Kenneth Brannagh's 1989 film Henry V, which was adapted from the Shakespeare play, and its dialogue is million miles away from the one in The King, but both portray king Henry V in different manners, in different tones even, with both title performances being up to par. Robert Pattinson's performance is excellent, if there is someone who shines in a role, it is him, without a doubt, and his French accent is delightful.Whether you are into English history or are a fan of Shakespeare's Henry V, you probably won't enjoy much of The King, but you could certainly try if you want to. Otherwise, I think this is a quite enjoyable film, one of Netflix's best productions for sure.",7,1,1,16 December 2019
Detroit Rock City," Rockin' comedy about 4 relentless KISS fans.
","This movie hits home for me as I can completely relate to the characters' determined and passionate desire to go see their favourite band in the whole world. With tough perserverance, they manage to fight every obstacle in their way, tenaciously. Edward Furlong is a vehicle for nostalgia to me. There's something about him that simply irradiates happiness in my way, and he's great in this, so are the rest of the boys, each and everyone get their own moments in the movie, which is important in order to let everyone's own setbacks be resolved according to each character's personality. Lyn Shaye shines as an overbearing and autocratic mother who is tryin' to control her son in every possible aspect.Well, as the boys get on their way to the best night of their lives, chaos ensues. And it's really funny, plus it's got a great soundtrack to jam along to.",7,1,1,28 September 2019
Joker," Not only Joaquin Phoenix but also Todd Philips.
","It's perfectly understandable that Joaquin Phoenix's performance is so strong that made Joker the colossal success that it is, but the movie aids his performance with a daring script, a notorious direction and a somber tone that makes everything dramatic and disturbing. The tension is a slow burn, it keeps adding up until it eventually explodes on key moments, showing exactly where Arthur Fleck's mindstate is at. Narratively speaking, tension build-up is one of the major points that prove Joker is a superlative film, worthy of all the praise it received, along with most of the elements that comprise it. Any flaw can simply be overlooked, because it almost touches perfection. That is the result of a magnificently complex character and a virtuosic performance that loudly shouts Oscar.Robert De Niro is in tip-top shape, delivering one of his finest performances in years of forgettable appearences in minor productions.
Todd Philips' Joker is a film everyone should see, you will probably see it because of Phoenix's performance, but you will finish it reflecting not only on his superb performance but on how conditioned a conflicted mind can be by the most discriminative side of an indifferent civilization, prompting them to go to unexpected and somewhat tragic and fatal lenghts.A powerful, formidable film that will be very hard to forget for decades to come.",9,2,6,4 December 2019
Con Air," So much better than typical action movies nowadays.
","While certainly it is an entertaining film, is not as good as other over-the-top action flicks of the 90s, Air Force One and Face Off come to mind.
While some one-liners remain classic, some others are just ridiculous. Nic Cage is just Nic Cage, he is kinda hard to take seriously in some of the movies he stars in, but he was acceptable in this. John Cusack and John Malkovich really pull their characters off. I believe the 90s continued a trend with action flicks, that may have started in the 80s and continue today with such unrealistic unplausible plots that somehow the heros magically save the day at the last minute. It all comes down to a greasy machine that keeps manufacturing these overproduced audiovisual pieces just for the sake of a genre, without providing something different to the formula. Well, at least movies like Con Air have a nostalgic element to it that decidely throws in an extra charm. And if you watched it in the 90s and you watch it now in 2019, you obviously realize it hasn't aged well, but it is still highly entertaining and not as bad as you recall. It's actually decent.",7,1,1,2 May 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Do yourself a favor and watch this gorgeous film.
","I honestly didn't know what to expect, the film's title certainly did enough to draw my attention and wonder what this movie was all about. I read its plot description and went in. I came across with a wonderful film, with amazing acting, very good dialogue and overall a compelling love story with a historical background which interested me greatly. When the first scene kicks in and we discover why the film is called The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society it all makes sense, and it's a rather funny scene, the way it develops, even though it takes place in an obscure context.The setting is just marvellous, it definitely adds to the film's structure. I thought it was interesting that the events take place after the Nazi occupation, although there are some flashbacks that refer back to the war. Lily James puts on an excellent performance, so do Michael Huisman (of Game of Thrones fame) and Penelope Wilton.
Really, I can't find something about this movie that I didn't like or enjoy. It is one of those films that entice you with the title and fully grab you with its fulfilling story.Another aspect that I find interesting is how they subtlety managed to blend the love interest between Juliet Ashton (James) and Dawsey Adams (Huisman) and the investigation Ashton was carrying out regarding Elizabeth McKenna's (Jessica Brown Findlay) disappearance by the hands of the Nazis, after helping someone in need in the midst of curfew. Neither one surpassed each other, and it had the added value of also be dealing with important pieces of literature, which along with tragedy, is what sustains this interesting group of people.This is a fine film, be sure to check it out! I wish I could read the book it is based upon.",8,1,3,7 October 2018
Kingpin," A comedy that bowls you over with fun.
","If you're ever feeling in the mood for something straight out funny and direct, you may try Kingpin. As it is a story about an outsider to the world of bowling that suddenly finds himself in a place no one ever thought he'd be. And on the other side of the coin there is a former player who has seen past his glory days and gets the miraculous oportunity for a much-desired comeback. Then you put Randy Quaid and Woody Harrelson, the Farrelly brothers on the directors' chair and you got yourself a great recipe for comedy. The comedic flow of the film is rather consistent, moving from funny situation to the next; with Ishmael's naivety and Roy Munson's street smarts the duo grows exponentially funny as approaching the climax of the film, it's rather obvious but it still evokes a warming comical sense of familiarity, which all comedy films should provoke.I should not forget that Bill Murray plays Roy's sleazy rival, a part for which he absolutely marvels anyone who watches him. Just for him alone you don't want to miss this wonderful comedy.",7,0,1,25 October 2019
Finding Dory," The opposite of boring.
","Surprisingly enough, Finding Dory managed to impress me even more than Finding Nemo did many years ago. It's palpable that the high-quality Pixar always delivers is still present in strong form. Finding Dory tells its story in an imaginative way, filled with clues and flashbacks that help Dory decipher her own origins. It's a type of wild adventure that only animated pictures can offer that is truly satisfying to watch, it's a thrilling ride so fantastically translated to the screen, the animation is precious. The newly added character, the octopus (well, septipus) Hank is nothing short of incredible. First off, it was greatly voiced by Ed O'Neill and his octopus mobility was perfectly captured, I was tremendously impressed every time Hank was moving around like a ninja or a trapeze artist with such effortlessness that it was engrossing to watch.The film itself is highly entertaining, it does not bore nor tire at any particular moment, it is carried by a strong visual narrative that manages to keep your eyes on the screen at all times. The visuals go along really well with the story of Nemo and Marlin trying to find Dory, and Dory trying to find her parents.The scene standout for me is without a doubt the truck scene where it falls to the river, freeing the fish. That is simply a stunning and inspiring scene, done so cleverly that is no surprising that it came from the masters at Pixar.Check out this wonderful sequel to a Pixar classic, you may even like it a bit more, or maybe not, depends on you. But rest assure that you will have a great time with this fine animated film.",9,1,2,4 December 2019
Halloween," Still so good after all these years.
","Sometimes it's hard to review such well-known films, classic films. It feels everything has already been said before. But old films and classics certainly do age, some of them well, some of them not so well. Watching them in different time periods certainly gives you a fresh perspective, but always keeping in mind the time and context in which the film was made. Having said that, I rewatched this horror gem a couple of months ago and the more you watch it, the more enjoyable it gets. This is the original, the ones that follow are just mediocre. This one is quality, the real deal. Here is the beginning of the battle between Michael Myers and Laurie, and is always so delightful to watch it gestate from the beginning until the end. So many cool scenes, and I don't know if this gets mention often or not, but I truly appreciate this movie's photography work. So many incredible shots that are a testament to this movie's classic status.Jamie Lee Curtis is great, this role came natural to her and she shows that on screen. I'm sure she inspired many that have attempted to portray her essence to a certain extent but have failed miserably, for she's one of a kind, as her performance is. You know how it is, it's so hard to fine convincing (let alone good) acting in these kinds of films, but you have one here. A timeless classic, to enjoy every month of October, or any time of the year.",9,3,4,27 November 2018
Marriage Story," Incredible performances elevate an honest portrayal.
","Marriage Story is a beautiful composition, plagued with heartfelt drama, severe emotional cuts and bruises, and a heartwarming honesty that relies heavily on the magnificent performances of its two leads, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johannson. Their performances elevate a very emotionally intelligent script, that knows in which moments to strike deep and clean, with resonating strong moments such as that powerful climax which will keep getting praise for years and years to come. Another standout is that musical number, with words almost as tragic as its performance, a solemn attemp by Adam Driver, whom has found his niche in demanding dramatic roles that require passion and strong intensity.Scarlett Johannson gives a firm portrayal of a woman, wife and actress who lives by the shadow of his theatre director husband, drawing an accurate sense of an overlooked woman, whom despite being successful professionally, is still heavily damaged by a loveless marriage.Marriage Story is not all about the performances, it feels like a real, authentic story, with a true and honest ending, which most of the times it is much more valuable than an happy one.",8,5,8,31 December 2019
Black Panther," I liked Thor: The Dark World far better than this.
","It took me quite a while to watch this one, as I didn't feel it would add something of substance to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, plus the fact that it was extremely over-hyped and I happen to dislike Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan's horrendous acting abilities. The filmmakers even misused Andy Serkis and Martin Freeman; to spoil two such great actors tells you something about this movie. I wasn't surprised, really; I expected this movie to be boring and unappealing to me. I tried to get pass all of those unfavourable things and just enjoy the film, because if it's at least silly entertainment with zero depth or interesting storytelling, then at least it accomplishes the entertainment factor, which is a good thing. Having said that, there were moments in which I found myself interested and involved, but those moments were few and faded away pretty quickly. Even the action I found it dull, nothing that could raise an eyebrow. The only thing I thought it was okay was the CGI, which I've seen a lot of people in here criticize. Whenever there were scenes of the tech used in Wakanda, I though the special effects were very well done.
I couldn't feel absolutely anything for these characters. Had they all died in the end, I wouldn't have been shocked or even cared at all. Michael B. Jordan as a villain was an utter joke, totally forced and unbelievable.I think Black Panther actually IS a cool character, but I dislike the way the actor has portrayed T'Challa, and to have a heavily criticized origin movie sort of creates an stigma for the character in my opinion. Although one could argue that it definitely has something to do with the masses and social media, because the hype was created by the people, the 'fans'. And fans disguised as 'journalists' posting about the movie on every site and on social media. Believe it or not all of this influences how many people view this character and his universe.All in all, this movie wasn't very good in my opinion, but I did enjoy some parts, so I'm giving it a 5. There are far more people out there with harsher words than mine who won't hesitate in rating it below 5. If there's a sequel, I will be watching for sure, but I'm not expecting much, that's for sure. Suddenly I feel like watching Static Shock or Blade for better outlets of metahumans of African-descent. And to why there are so many people praising this flick as if it was The Dark Knight, it's beyond me.",4,1,1,20 April 2019
Jojo Rabbit," A funny, tender piece on human connection in Third Reich times.
","First off, when you think about the thematic concept of this film, you wonder about the very specific tone it requires for the comedy to work, without affecting and unbalancing the drama, since even nowadays can still be quite a touchy subject matter. Yet, Taika Watiti's magnificent and well-deserved Oscar winning screenplay adapted from a novel, goes to show what a great thing it is to still have creativity put into heartfelt cinema in a cultural world where remakes, reboots and reunions seem to be the general agenda to commercialize. Creativity even in a thematic field where many have come and gone on numerous ocassions, where is hard to tell stories that can genuinely make one laugh within the somber context of the situation, without taking any seriousness of it, and that's where the story is successful, where one can cherish the proper execution, where every single actor played their parts extremely well that helped the story flow so smoothly.Jojo Rabbit has incredibly well-written characters which is where it resides its clue to function as a dark comedy, given its disconcerting times.
Jojo's interactions with his mother are quite clever, and can leave an impression on you; and scenes with Elsa have such a comedic weight that gives you such joy that you're instantly reminded that usually these kinds of stories don't end up too well.I believe this film will be remembered for years to come and it will come to be even more appreciated than it is today. This is one that I can watch over and over again.",9,0,2,29 April 2020
Green Book," Beautiful depiction of human bond.
","When I first found out about this film I was hyped, mainly because of the pairing of Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen. I mean, they are both such fantastic actors and come from very different filmic backgrounds so I was definitely interested. Also what caught my attention was Peter Farrelly's shift towards a drama picture. The fact that it involved a character being a classical pianist was a plus. It seemed like a recipe for a perfect film, yet it lacked some ingredients. I actually liked the fact that the racism came from a different place, it had different shades to it. Most of Dr. Don Shirley's audience were of upper class, people with refined tastes such as opera, art and classical music. So naturally, they highly respected him but nevertheless discriminated him because of the colour of his skin. That subtle treatment was done to a great extent in my opinion, rather than
showing merciless violence. Because it reminds us that racism can come in different, more fine-drawn ways that are still quite offensive because of its subtlety, and sometimes non-direct fashion. A lot of people feel that racism was treated quite lightly, to which I believe it was necessary to succesfully capture different nuances of the situation I stated earlier, regarding Dr. Shirley's profession and his target audience.Viggo and Mahershala give exceptional performances for two very different characters; they depicted Tony and Don's relationship quite well, it was a joy watching pure talent in the screen. Does it have a feel-good tone to it? Yes, this is a story about how two characters were able to look Don Shirley for what he truly is, a wonderful, gifted, highly intelligent human being; no matter the colour of his skin or his sexual orientation; let's not forget this happened in America's darkest decade, that is why their relationship takes a higher meaning.I deeply enjoyed this film, it was greatly written, beautifully acted and well directed. It's enough for me.",8,1,1,13 May 2019
Incredibles 2," Tons of fun.
","I get why many people complain that this movie fell victim of the times that we live in, that it tries to be politically correct, being one of the aspects that make this movie bad. I disagree wholeheartedly, this movie could have been done ten years ago and still would have made a positive impact. Helen being given the spotlight makes it different, more dynamic. Sure, it is predictable, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. How it all flows to get to the climax is really entertaining. Plus, we see Jack Jack in action, talk about a highlight.If Mr. Incredible is bad at domestic situations, it's because he never bothered dealing with them in the first place, it's the nature of the character not to worry about stuff like that, and just leave it to Helen. Sexist? Yes, but that's how the characters were built in the first movie, and that's how they were constructed as a family core, to be as traditional as it comes.This film fell victim of the times we live in, because most folks feel that Helen being the main character in this movie is 'feminist propaganda', just because
feminism is growing stronger by the day, so anything that involves a strong woman in the lead is 'feminist propaganda'. It's absolutely absurd, and I feel sorry for those people. This is a great movie, fun, entertaining, with a different dynamic. Watch it and see it for yourself.",8,2,3,25 May 2019
