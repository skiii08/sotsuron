The Perks of Being a Wallflower," We accept the love we deserve
",This is my first review and its brief. I do not understand the need for lengthy reviews. After watching this four times in six days i felt compelled to give my own ten pence worth. I've never seen a film like this where i have loved all the characters. The cast are brilliant and story moves along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is amazing. I love movies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works on so many levels. I am not usually one for this sort of genre and came close to taking this back before actually watching it. I am so glad i did not. Its going to be a very long time before something tops this. This is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones. If you love movies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is for you.,9,9,14,17 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I understood what the director was trying to do...
","I imagine it went something like this:There is a huge board where all the crew members are allowed to throw ideas out. They're all given a fair shout and placed on the board. Rhian Johnson gets his duck whistle out and plays a cheesy tune to a chicken - that's just had it's throat slit - running madly about the board. When the chicken dies and where it stops is the next idea to happen in the script.That's the only explanation I have for this abortion. I'll never watch another Star Wars movie again because of this. Why bother saying what's wrong with it. If you can't work that out watching it, well...",4,9,11,7 April 2018
