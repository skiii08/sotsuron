Lone Survivor," 'Riveting. Our Navy Seals are BADASS.'
","Saw Lone Survivor tonight at Regal Cinemas staring Mark Wahlberg as Marcus Luttrell and Taylor Kitsch as the late USS Michael Murphy. Great movie! It just goes to show you the sacrifice many American people have made for/to the United States to preserve our way of life, including myself! Secondly, the film depicts the importance of radio communications and air-support from the The U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, United States Air Force, and we can't forget The U.S. Navy in the Theater of Combat Operations! The movie has strategic moments but it mostly features very intense/violent scenes including a beheading and several gun fights with the Taliban in Afghanistan and traumatic injuries to members of United States Navy Seal Team 10 who took part in Operation Red Wings (June-July 2005). Crazy movie, but as Justin Timberlake tweeted via Twitter: 'Go see #LoneSurvivor now... Riveting. Our Navy Seals are BADASS.' Indeed! I give it a cinema score of 9/10! MUST SEE! http://www.lonesurvivorfilm.com/site #maverickradio",9,2,11,19 January 2014

Spotlight," Shining The Spotlight: What Investigative Reporting Is All About
","Saw 'Spotlight' starring Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, and Rachel McAdams at Regal Cinemas. The film is based on a true story which portrays what kind of in-depth investigative journalistic reporting it takes to uncover decades of wrong-doings by the Catholic Church, regarding covering-up priests who took advantage and molested several children across Boston, Massachusetts and beyond.This year-long investigation by The Boston Globe starting in 2001, explores several victims of sex-crimes which were committed; but no one up to this point in the film ever was convicted of a crime. It is up to the 'Spotlight' Team of investigative Reporters at The Boston Globe, led by Walter 'Robby' Robinson, played by Keaton to lead his staff in cracking this case by exposing the abusive Catholic Church Priests to the public and getting justice for those victims.The compassion for the victims these reporters had and the passion to gather enough evidence from decades past in order to write a top-notch story to present publicly was extraordinary and well-acted out throughout the film! Sacha Pfeiffer played by McAdams and 'Robby' played by Keaton confront attorney Eric Macleish played by Billy Crudup who represented the many victims of priests within the Catholic Church, but ultimately they learn he settled these cases outside of court to prevent any paper-trail for a future investigation like this one and obviously public uproar.Macleish initially refuses to discuss any details of these settlements and really never does, but while confronting him in the lobby where his law firm resides, 'Robby' appears to threaten Macleish for a victim list. Both he Pfeiffer finally get a list of victims from Macleish later on in the film to add to the other compiled evidence; this after originally claiming he (Macleish) sent a list of victims over to the Globe a few years prior to this investigation and no revealing story ever came from it.Ruffalo who plays Reporter Mike Rezendes shows how much desire he and the entire Spotlight team had to prepare and write a solid story by making several attempts to find credible evidence and sources, while pro-actively taking their time in the field to gather court documents which were sealed-off to the public prior to his efforts in getting those released to the court records room.Searching for names through old books, making phone calls and hitting the streets interviewing victims were other strategies used by the Spotlight Team while they gathered vital information up to develop their damning story against abusive Catholic Priests. Overall, the film portrayal was interestingly on-point to real-life events as reported, in addition to the acting, and lived-up to its genre, Drama. Definitely a good movie night out! My cinema score is 9/10.You can check out The Boston Globe's take on this film HERE: http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/spotlight-movie",9,3,6,2 December 2015

If you love music and have a dream of making it BIG in the Music Industry, you'll love this film! My official cinema score is 9/10! http://beginagainfilm.com/ #maverickradio",9,2,5,3 September 2014
American Sniper," Legendary Service To Country
","Legendary Service To Country: Watched American Sniper directed by Clint Eastwood, starring Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller. This 2014 American Biographical War Drama based on the 2012 book by The 'Most Lethal Sniper' in U.S. Military History, U.S. Navy SEAL Team 3 Chief Chris Kyle who was credited with over 150 kills, depicts actual combat events which took place over in Falujah, Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom.The film begins with Chris Kyle played by Cooper and his younger brother Jeff Kyle played by Keir O'Donnell as rodeo cowboys from Texas.

The Fault in Our Stars," Love Conquers All
","Love Conquers All: I saw The Fault in Our Stars starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort tonight at AMC Theatres! 'Hazel' (Shailene Woodley) meets 'Gus' (Ansel Elgort) at a cancer support group meeting and they basically fall in love. 'Hazel' does have doubts about falling in love because of her terminal health condition stating she's a 'Ticking Time-Bomb' but gives in to 'Gus' who really goes hard for her. I really liked how they both were very witty even knowing their lives would eventually end. I also liked his style of trying to land a date! Not too aggressive but romantic to say the least. Nothing like two virgins going on a picnic! ;-) 'An Imperial Affliction' by 'Peter Van Houten' played by Willem Dafoe was a book mainly 'Hazel' was obsessed with but her boyfriend 'Gus' becomes interested in what the book was about, what it had to offer to their relationship, and her real story, not her cancer story. This led 'Hazel' 'Gus' and her mother 'Frannie' played by Laura Dern to take a dream trip to Amsterdam, Netherlands seeking out answers to their questions regarding Van Houten's book.The end of the movie is quite tragic and emotional, but there's a twist of irony prior to the tragic ending. How would you like to attend your own funeral? Tom Sawyer did in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I would say, if you go see it, take a box of Kleenex® Brand, your significant, other OR close friend with you, so you have someone's shoulder to cry on! Just sayin... I give it a rating of 9/10! Go see it! #maverickradio",9,3,6,14 July 2014
Non-Stop," I Hate Flying Too!
","Saw Non-Stop starring Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Nate Parker, and Lupita Nyong'o at AMC Theatres Monday Night! I hate flying just like Air Marshal 'Bill Marks' played by Neeson, and haven't flown since 2005, but the movie had a great sense of suspenseful mystery where he had to figure out which passenger(s) were behind the conspiracy of plotting to high-jack an international trans-Atlantic flight to London, United Kingdom against him. There was plenty of action in this 107 minute thriller of a film and I was satisfied with the film overall.Ever since 9/11, there have been high alerts here in the United States and abroad when it comes to flying the not so friendly skies, so to speak. I'm not sure if the motivation of the real hijackers in this movie, who apparently served in the U.S. Military during Operation Enduring Freedom as depicted in the film, was $150 Million OR the sense that their service in the war was taken for granted. I'm guessing it was a bit of both and by setting-up 'Marks' was their revenge against an ungrateful nation, which in the end ultimately backfired! I also liked the scene where 'Marks' helped the little girl on the plane, 'Becca' played by Quinn McColgan face her fears of flying. As I mentioned, never liked flying, but had to do it when I was in the U.S. Navy! It sucked! I give the film an 8/10 and if you like action thriller movies with a twist of suspenseful mystery, this is your film to see!

22 Jump Street," Schmidt & Jenko Crack The Case
","'Schmidt' & 'Jenko' Crack The Case: Saw Jump Street Movies at Regal Cinemas tonight! What a hilarious sequel to 21 Jumpstreet! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum really do have great chemistry on the BIG SCREEN and 'Captain Dickson' played by Ice Cube is also very funny in the movie! The mission this time is to 'crack down' on drug hustlers pushing 'WhyFy' to college students after a female student dies from using, so the crime-fighting duo are sent to the campus to investigate who the distributors are.During the movie 'Jenko' played by Tatum bonds very well with the jocks and joins the college football team while 'Schmidt' played by Hill finds himself taking their investigation to the art majors and poetry lovers. Here he ends up finding love in 'Maya,' a student played by the very beautiful and talented Amber Stevens who later becomes his greatest surprise! Both 'Schmidt' & 'Jenko' also learn how valuable they are as a team after splitting-up during this crazy investigation.The only distasteful parts of the movie were the Tracy Morgan and Maya Angelou references; being that Angelou recently passed-on and Morgan was involved in a tragic motor-vehicle accident. How ironic, right? There's a really funny surprise at the end too! How many more of these 'Jump Street' movies will they make? You might want to ask Seth Rogen! If you are looking for a very funny date night move, definitely check out 22 Jump Street and happy movie going! 9/10! http://www.22jumpstreetmovie.com/site/ #maverickradio",9,2,7,16 June 2014
Steve Jobs," Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish
","Saw 'Steve Jobs' at AMC Theaters on Veterans Day. Unlike 'JOBS' (2013) starring Ashton Kutcher, 'Steve Jobs' (2015) starring Michael Fassbender, as Jobs, Kate Winslet as Johanna Hoffman, Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak, and Jeff Daniels as John Sculley, is one which depicts Mr. Jobs business-oriented life, along with his personal life. The struggles of starting-up a computer business, developing a good product, marketing it well to consumers' needs and dealing with taking care of personal family life responsibilities are all areas which this film touch on.The most fascinating factor about the film was Steve Jobs himself and his driving desire to revolutionize computer technology as we know it, at any cost, no matter what, while making sacrifices all throughout when it came to parental responsibilities towards his daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs, who he initially denied paternity.There is a constant struggle during the film between Chrisann Brennan, Lisa's mother played by Katherine Waterston and Jobs regarding paternity. Her personal struggle is defined clearly, as applying for welfare to survive as a single mother while Apple was thriving in the early 1980's, worth an estimated $400 Million at the time was cited in the film.Another interesting aspect of the film delves in to three exciting product launch meetings, the last in 1998 with the introduction of iMac. During the film, Steve Wozniak played by Rogen pushes Jobs to credit the Apple II team leaders during these new product launch meetings due to the impact that work had in leading in to the future of Apple and its products. Jobs appeared to be selfish and wanted all the credit aimed towards him.This biographical movie was interesting to say the least, with several distracting yet defining moments in Jobs' life which he took as a motivating challenge to overcome, then finally realizing at the end that his daughter was more important than his technological creations. My cinema score is 8/10 and you should definitely see it if you like biographical films which take a look back at, depict, and define history.",8,0,2,12 November 2015
Furious 7," One Last Ride
","Saw Furious 7 starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Dwayne The Rock Johnson, along with Kurt Russell at Regal Cinemas tonight! I got to tell you, it was worth the wait! This movie was action-packed throughout, with several funny and also heart-breaking emotional moments. If you are a fanatic of fast cars, exotic places around the world like Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emerates, beautiful HOT women, and most of all, the 'Fast and Furious' Franchise, then this movie is for you! This time, bad guy International Terrorist 'Deckard Shaw' played by Statham seeks revenge against 'Dominic Toretto' and his family 'Torretto' (Diesel). The family is under fire from one-by-one killing attempts by 'Deckard Shaw' who is the younger brother of an International Terrorist named 'Owen Shaw,' as he seeks revenge for his now comatose older brother. 'Torretto' is out to get his own personal payback for the death of one of his family members, 'Han-Seoul-Oh' who was killed off in Tokyo, Japan at the conclusion of Fast and Furious 6 in 2013 when actor Sung Kang decided not to return. 'Torretto' also spends time during the film to help 'Letty' (Rodriguez) remember all they've been through.The already action-packed plot thickens when a Somalian Terrorist by the name of 'Jakarde,' played by Djimon Hounsou and a shady government official, 'Mr. Nobody' (Russell) both desire to steal the same computer terrorism program, 'God's Eye,' that has the capability to track down anyone, anywhere, and turn any device into a deadly weapon. 'Torretto' gets his team back together one more time to stop 'Shaw' and the other terrorists by planning an air entrance out of a cargo airplane with fast cars on to a mountain-side rescuing a kidnapped girl by the name of 'Ramsey' played by Nathalie Emmanuel and uses her to hack the system in order to dismantle 'God's Eye' program. All this happening during an intense struggle for power between terrorists and the United States Government.Finally, I totally loved the emotional memorial dedication to Paul Walker towards the end of this film! Definitely go see it and take your date! Not too sure if 'Furious 8' will happen, or if anyone is interested, but it is rumored if this does happen the film might take place in New York, New York! Love that idea! My Cinema Score for this film is 9/10! Happy Movie Going!;-)#‎maverickradio‬",9,1,3,7 April 2015
