National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Just awful
","Silly movie for kids - if you're into feeding your kid with a lot of nationalist bullshit. The plot is childish, with a lot of childish solutions for every tension. If keyboards came with a bank of sounds called 'Cinema' - with a button for 'Comedy release melody', or 'Action time' and 'Moment for love', they could actually just use the music from this movie. Horrible acting. Nicolas Cage, I guess, tries to be a cartoon character with his face at some point. At least he is trying... Ed Harris just stays there with a serious face and makes his money. A lot of silly unreasonable puzzles involving US History trivia. I watched the movie and gave it two stars. Then I realized there was one of those useless outoftheplot final scenes. I watched it and changed my vote for a single star.",1,5,9,24 August 2008
BlacKkKlansman," Misleading genre
","This is not a comedy and should not be listed as a comedy, because the movie isn't funny. It has a couple of good laughs, sure, but a comedy movie? No way. I was very confused. I was expecting some Black Dynamite, but instead got a black Christmas movie, with a couple of Santa Cops. It took me about 2 hours into the movie to understand it should have been listed as 'science fiction'.It can be a good movie, I guess, if you don't know any better. It's not a bad movie either, just mah.",6,3,4,8 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Laughing so hard
","This movie is amazing. I was actually kinda frustrated about something, but that was my own fault. I was led to believe one of the characters would have a greater impact on the story - but those were my own crazy theories and the movie was not about that. But it is an amazing movie. It plays a lot with the audience's expectations, so I guess the way not to like this movie is trying to force your own expectations, instead of just enjoying the ride. Amazing actors. Amazing scenes. The ending is really, really good. When I understood what the movie was actually about, I was laughing so hard, it felt great. Another great movie from Tarantino. I don't even watch Hollywood movies anymore. Japanese anime and Korean cinema are way better. I didn't have much expectations about this movie being a great movie. But it was.",10,11,15,1 December 2019
