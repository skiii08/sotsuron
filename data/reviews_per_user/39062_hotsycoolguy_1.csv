Blade Runner 2049," Typically American
","I expected action and suspense. And there is lots. However, what really struck me, is that all the characters are armed. And in my perception, that is typically American, because that is part of their basic rights. There is just too much unwarranted shooting, personal attacks, physical violence and property destruction. And that I do not find enjoyable. The story could have been told differently.",1,12,28,9 October 2017
