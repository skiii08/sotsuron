Requiem for a Dream," How low can you go?
","As the credits rolled, I took a deep breath, and I thought 'what a moving film!'. I tried to recommend it to friends, but I couldn't bring up the words 'this is a beautiful film'. This is an intense, stirring, thought-provoking film - yes. It is about doing drugs. About being addicted, into the deep pits of obsession.It is the mark of a great director to provoke the sensorial impressions of this film: quick frame succession, surreal look, obsessive soundtrack - the imagery and sound closely explore what we think we know about hallucinogens.The question I found emerging as the film moved on was 'how low can you go?'. It is a crescendo - of seasons, of scenes, of pace. And the answer the film gave me was 'lower, and lower, and lower...' - addiction has no end to how much human degradation it can bring.",8,0,1,21 May 2012
