Alien 3," Good but weakest of the saga
","It's been awhile since I've been reviewing so now here I go again reviewing another Alien movie in the saga. Alien 3 has always been good yet a confusing and melodramatic entry in the series. Some things I felt didn't add up in the series. The directing, acting, and some special effects were pretty good. I think this time it was the script that kinda needed some adjusting I mean its not bad but it wasn't that god plus the plot needed some explaining. The movie opens up with a few shots of the ship SULACO and reveals an alien on aboard causing the ship to catch on fire, last remaining survivors sent in a shuttle and then causing the ship to be destroyed. They crash land on a prison planet filled with nothing but men. Unfortunately Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) ends up only being the only survivor and the rest dead. When Newt is dead she suspects something about her death like an Alien may have killed her but Dr. Clemons (Charles Dance) dosen't think so. However later on a dog ends up being impreganted and Alien emerges and is ready to kill once again. While dealing with her case Ripley is ordered to shave her hair because of a lice problem on the planet and also engages in a relationship with Clemons who is more then willing to help her if he could. However Superintendent Andrews (Brain Glover), wants this woman to be rid of since she's considered a high priority and since the system dosen't really allow women. The prisoners don't really care about it that much Dillion (Charles Dutton) even tolerates the intolerable. But soon enough they realize that the Alien is killing several people and the prisoners begin to question how to kill it since the prison has no weapons of any kind. Alien 3 in my opinion trys to be a really stylish film it comes close to working but fails in retrospect. Like It should have fleshed out the characters, Clemons and Ripley's relationship could have been a developed more as well as the others prisoners it seemed liked the edited the wrong scenes. Oh and how did an Alien get there in the first place was Bishop in on it could be but to me Bishop seemed like an ok android but you never know. Burke could had more aliens but it would seem impossible so that to isn't proven. Plus I mentioned some of the special effects were good the movements of the Alien running around and all that stuff weren't that good they kinda looked fake in some spots but they did whatever they could. Plus the ending was sad I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it but those who have you already understand. I didn't hate Alien 3 I think the actors did a pretty good job (especially Weaver, Dutton and Dance and Henriksen last appearance). The directing was good for David Fincher as a first time director (who will make the successful Seven). Alien 3 is too melodramatic and poorly edited but as it stands on it's own its a good movie to watch none the less. Regular Scale- 3/5: 1-10 Scale- 7/10. NOTE: I think in order for the film to be better they need to reinstate some scenes that were ultimately cut out that further explained the story and fleshed out the characters. I think the Quadrilogy set will have this so in the end Alien 3 could become a classic that never was.",7,2,4,8 May 2003
Alien: Resurrection," Not as good as the first two but better than Alien 3
","To sum this up Alien: Resurrection is great example of combining action and some suspense and make it entertaining as best as possible. While it doesn't have the scariness of the first two or the best acting, It's not as melodramatic as Alien 3. The story revolves around 200 years later after Ellen Ripley's death on Fury 161 where scientists have genetically cloned her since she had an Alien queen founded by the Company. While after the Queen Alien has been removed from the cloned Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), she is been kept alive for stasis etc. Then a cargo shop which has a load of humans that are to be used for hosts. A curious female later to be known as the android Call (Winona Ryder) finds the cloned Ripley and sooner or later all of the people are in trouble because, now the Alien Experiments have minds of there own and now are attempting to create a colony of there own. This movie was a pretty good one to watch I enjoyed the movie even if there were flaws. The one major one was Call, Winona Ryder is a good actress but I felt her lines were dry and she could have done better, and some characters that I felt that should have stayed in the movie more like the character Elgyn, and Brad Dourif. Another flaw was the Alien human hybrid creature it was just too sick and depressing for that kind of thing. Now off to the good stuff Sigourney Weaver potrays the Ripley clone in a different way but It's not bad I especially liked the scene where she founds out about the other Clone experiments failed. Ron Perlman gives a great performance as the muscle bound Johner who likes to make a joke at just about anything. Dominque Pinon was an Interesting character as Vriess, Kim Flowers was ok but had no character development but I did like Brad Dourif's humor relief (Especially making those faces at the Aliens) and J.E. Freeman was ok. The writing by Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer series) is a decent job but could have used some elements that could have given a more familiar Alien look to it but wasn't bad for his first try. The directing was stylish by French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet who's proberly directed a few classy french films before this one. The Visual Effects were good if not bad few were sorta fake but not bad. Overall I think this was a close to excellent movie that was underated and should have gotten more profit at the Box Office and to me Alien Resurrection was a near return to the Alien saga.Regular Scale-4/5: 1-10 Scale-8/10",8,3,5,9 June 2003
The Terminator," A Great achievement in Film making
","The Terminator serves as one of the best movies made in 1984 with a well thought out story, well written screenplay and put it midly excellent direction. This movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as the silent killing machine known to man as The Terminator (T-800 Model 101) and is sent into time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton)to prevent the birth of her son, future leader resistence John Connor. A future soldier by the name of Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to 1984, to intercept The Terminator  before it kills Sarah. The acting in this film is memorable, Arnold is perfect as The Terminator with absoutely no emotion of killing people. Biehn is great as Reese a soldier who is bound by duty and honor but never has experienced Love in his life which he will receive later on and is potrayl is so real you can not help but feel sorry for him. Hamilton does a wonderful potrayl as Sarah Connor the victim of all this who can't believe that she will be the mother for the future and is scared about what happens when she has this child. Other supporting Actors are good including Paul Winfield and the late Lance Henriksen a Cameron favorite. This is proberly James Cameron's greatest achievement in 1984 whenever he made this movie he wrote and directed, along with his former wife producer Gale Anne Hurd. The Visual Effects in today's standards are not up to par but however still they are bot bad for a movie made in 1984 and besides Orion Pictures Studio only gave him a 6.4 millon dollar budget to work nothing much i would say. However the makeup designs and creations by Stan Winston are still excellent to this day he remains one of the best Creature designs ever (Endoskeleton for example remains the best work in 1984). The Terminator serves as a great art for filmmaking it inspires filmmakers to make what you have. Regular scale: 4.5/5; 1-10 Scale: 9.5/10. Oh I own the MGM Special Edition DVD get that and you'll have loads of Special Features and an Excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX i highly recommend it.",9,1,2,19 April 2003
Alien," The one that Started it all
","Alien is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time because of its scaryness and eerieness as well. The script, story, actors, Directing and Special Effects are excellent. The story is simple as it follows a routine Mothership on its way to earth is piloted toward an Unknown planet with an unknown origin about it. When they land there they discover mysetrious alien beings living down there when a smaller alien (Known as a queen face hugger i believe) attaches himself to a crew member. Later in the film it comes off of him and the ship leaves the planet but, however the Alien begins to take a form of its own by slaining each crew member as it grows bigger. Only Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) can stop it from coming to earth. The baby Alien coming out of Kane's chest is gross but a memorable scene of what fear an Alien could bring. All of these elements in Alien success with only one tiny problem the film kinda drags but it is forgotten. Sigourney Weaver does a great job potraing Lt. Ellen Ripley she would do a wonderful job in the superior sequel Aliens. However this movie is the one that started it so i think its the second best in the series because its the one that depended upon characters and the storyline. Director Ridley Scott directs with a great visual appeal just like on many of his other films and H.R Giger's design really gives it that dark Alien quality to it you can really believe it. I give Alien on a regular scale 4.5/5 and the 10 scale a 9.5/10. NOTE: Wait for a better edition on DVD there suppose to be releasing a QUADRILOGY set with loads of extras luckily i didn't buy the Legacy set.",Null,0,1,18 April 2003
Aliens," The best out of the saga
","Sometimes in movies sequels are made they end up being the same, the worst or the best. Aliens fits in the better than 1st one category. It's sometimes rare that a sequel surpasses the original mainly because of different writers, directors or lack of creativity. However Director and writer James Cameron knew firsthand of what to do and delivered what the audience wanted a fierce action film but with fear and darkness along with it that made it a truely aspiring film. Cameron earlier directed The Terminator a well done film in 1984 that promoted him as an excellent director and now he directs a film that is proberly his 2nd best. The story (Also written by Cameron) takes place 57 years later when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is picked up by a salvage team and lets her know what has happened during her long hypersleep. As the film progresses there have been terraforming factories on the planet that Ripley explored many years earlier that are trying to establish a colony but in reality are working for the company to try and get mysterious aliens. Later on Earth has lost contact with the colonists and decide to send marines in to found out why. A company associate by the name of Burke (Paul Reiser) try's to convince Ripley of going with the Marines to advise them of what these creatures are capable of. After all the bad dreams Ripley has been having she finally agrees to join them. The film progresses on meeting many tough marines introducing them like the respectful Hicks (Michael Biehn), the tough Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein) and my personal favorite the complaining showoff Hudson (Bill Paxton. As they land they discover weird, unusual and mysterious things. However a little girl by the name of Newt (Carrie Henn) is the only survivor and already knows what's happened to the colonists and to her family. As they enter the main complex they discover they have to fight the aliens as well before they become hosts to make more aliens. Once again its up to Ripley to help the marines and later to battle the Queen Alien from laying more eggs again. The performances are the best, Sigourney Weaver gives is what proberly her best performance of her life and is much convincing in this role of Ripley than she was in Alien. I especially like it when she establishes the relationship with Newt since they're both alone and are full of emotion it generally makes you care about them a lot. Michael Biehn gives a great performance as Corporal Hicks, Bill Paxton is a hoot to watch a great one liner 'This ain't happening man', 'This ain't happening'. Other performances are great including Reiser's performance as Burke, Goldstein as (Vasquez) and a great one to watch Lance Henriksen as Bishop as a synthetic android who's highly intelligent. The Special Effects are still the best and convincing done by Stan Winston who always creates the best Special Effects in makeup especially the slime, Alien warriors, The Face huggers (They diffentely make me jump still to this day and i meant to say just plain face hugger in Alien, but they're still born of a queen). Anyway everything about this film is spectacular Directing, Writing, Production, Music by James Horner is creepy at times and one of his best (Also i should have said Jerry Goldsmith delivered a fine score too) and the acting as well. Only made for 18.5 million dollars proves to me that James Cameron could make any kind of spectacular film out of money and he did. Also get the Special Edition that runs 154mins it makes the film a little bit easier to understand and its more emotional.Regular Scale- 5/5: 1-10 Scale- 10/10",10,0,2,23 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Excellent Star Wars movie
","It's a really excellent Star Wars movie. Avoid all those reviews that give it a 1 they went in expecting bad things as usual, to nitpick at everything instead of listing any good things whatsoever. Well it's not up to par w/ the original trilogy, but surpasses Episode I and II (despite me enjoying them). OK I just wanted to give it a 10 so it can stay in the top 250, but now it's dropped to 249 :(. All the actors do a fine job despite a few overacted scenes including the so called romantic scenes w/Anakin and Padme, 'Palpatine's No, No, No You will die' line. However, storyline is good, characters are great, but the best lies w/ the Visual Effects, they are the best I've ever seen for awhile especially in the 1st 10 minutes and the climax in the Mustafar scenes. Anyway, if you really thought it was excellent, see it as many times as possible.",10,5,11,6 June 2005
