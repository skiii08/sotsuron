The Blair Witch Project," Disney's 'Escape From Witch Mountain' was better.
","Trust me!!! This movie is not what you think it is. Interesting idea, but not scary or even suspenseful.  However, I think they have created an entertaining film, but its just not scary.The type of people who will think 'Blair Witch Project' is scary are people who are afraid to watch programs that start off with: 'WARNING This program contains graphic images of a violent nature. It may not me suitable for all audiences.'I'm a big fan of the 'less is more' school of thought, but this just didn't do it for me. I'll stick to Hitchcock and Rod Serling for that inspiration.Horror? NO WAY!!! Psychological Thriller? I think not! But entertaining: Yes. If you want to see an entertaining film then watch 'The Blair Witch Project.' However, if you want to see a scary movie then go rent Disney's 'Escape From Witch Mountain' because its a lot scarier!!!",6,1,2,30 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Tim Burton's homage to Hammer Films.
","I read in an interview where Burton said that he was very influenced by Hammer Films. I think Sleepy Hollow pays homage to that beautifully!
Burton's films often have a dark, surreal, but yet corny feel to them. Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Mars Attacks are all proof of that. Of course, mixing Pee Wee's Playhouse with the darker side of life is going to yield some pretty interesting results no matter who you are!! I think what makes Burtons so unique is his ability to  mix the lighter side of life with the darker side, and when he does its a totally unique vision! 
In 'Sleepy Hollow' we get to see a slightly more serious side to Burton with just a hint of his corny nature. Its is evident that he treated this project with great respect. I think it came out nicely. Yeah, the story may have changed considerably from the original Washington Irving story that you remember as a kid, but the film still does a great job of capturing the gloom and doom of this classic gothic tale. I've never seen so much fog in my life!! I actually didn't mind the rendering of the original story at all. Kevin Yagher (who is primarily known as a special-effects make-up artist) makes his first debut as a screenwriter. He crafts a decent mystery and gave the headless horseman a more evil supernatural background.Oh yeah, I almost forgot, the cinematography is great!!  You'd be surprised how much of the film was actually filmed indoors on a set in England. I've seen lots of behind the scenes footage from some independent film magazines showing the graveyard set. Did you notice the cloudy horizon in the background? Its fake, but astonishing to say the least!!! How'd they do that??? The headless horseman's dead tree was made of fiber glass, but Burton's team did an incredible job!!! Emmanuel Lubezki really knows how to use light; or shall I say lack of it!! Nice Atmosphere!!! Cheers!!",Null,0,0,22 November 1999
Army of Darkness," In the words of Ash, 'Listen up you Primitive Screw-heads!!!'
","Although I've already commented about 'Army of Darkness' before, I felt I had to clear up a common misconception about the film. Sometimes you have to spell it out for some of the slower people out there!!!
You see, I was just talking the other day with someone who was deeply offended that Sam Raimi released Army of Darkness, and that it was an insult to the whole Evil Dead Trilogy. This is because he didn't find it scary at all. GEEEZ!!! Can you believe that??? He didn't find 'Army of Darkness' scary... hmmmm???? .... I wonder why???? .....hmmmmm??? Maybe because 'Army of Darkness' is first and foremost a COMEDY! Ever heard of it? Yeah, its something called COMEDY. You know, the kinda stuff we laugh at. It was a clever move on Raimi's part, but unfortunately some of the slower people on the planet didn't get it. In fact, have you ever noticed how the Extras in Raimi's films are credited as Fake Shemps? (As in SHEMP from the THREE STOOGES)  .....Ahhhhhhh I'm seeing a pattern here.So in the words of our dear protagonist Ash, 'Listen up you primitive screw-heads!!!' The jokes on you!!!! You didn't get the joke because you have the sense of humor of a house plant!!Whats that I hear? 'You mean ARMY OF DARKNESS is a Comedy???''Ahhhhhhhhh....... Now I get it!!!!!'",10,2,3,5 November 1999
Army of Darkness," HONESTLY: 'The Three Stooges' meets 'The Evil Dead' meets 'Monty Python' and 'The Terminator'
","This movie is a must see. It is a classic. If you have ever seen 'The Evil Dead 2: Dead At Dawn' then you'll understand where 'Army of Darkness' came from.However, Army of Darkness is SO MUCH better than The Evil Dead 2!!! I would classify it as a 'fantasy/action/comedy' movie rather than a straight up horror flick.In fact, one gets the impression they started filming The Evil Dead 2, and by the end they realized that their idea worked better as a comedy. (The Evil Dead 2 actually gets pretty funny towards the end and it shows the birth of Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) as a modern day action-hero. A shot gun strapped to his back and a chainsaw for an arm. It just doesn't get any better than this.Plus you get to see the classic Evil Dead 'Shaky-Cam' (when two people strap a camera to a board a run through the woods fast a hell.)Its one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Funny as Hell!!!!! This movie contains some of the greatest action hero 'one-liners' ever spoken!!!!",10,1,1,17 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," M. Night Shyamala, I'm sure that Rod Serling smiles at you from the Twilight Zone!!
","I think its fair to say that Rod Serling would've loved this film. Trust me, 'the twist' is an honest to God 'twist and 1/2!'Honestly, I was reluctant to see this movie at first because I was beginning to think that maybe the reason why mainstream audiences liked this film so much is because so many movies in 1999 were either sub-par or extremely over rated. I was already duped once this year by 'The Blair Witch Project' but a close friend of my mine reassured me that The Sixth Sense had 'one of the best endings in movie history.' Thinking that his statement was a pretty bold one, I decided to check it out for myself. VERDICT: The Sixth Sense is thus far, the best film of the 1999.When the twist came at the end, I haven't heard so many 'Oh's &  Ah's' and even crying in a theatre in recent memory. As the credits were rolling, I was still sitting in my seat in a daze. Even an hour later, I was still pondering about it.I'm admittedly very good at guessing 'the twist' to movies because I've seen a lot of them and I'm a student of film. However, with The Sixth Sense, I just missed guessing 'the twist' only by a hair. You see, I had a hunch that it was like the ending of a Twilight Zone episode called <POSSIBLE SPOILER>'The Hitch-Hiker', however, I guessed the wrong character.<END POSSIBLE SPOILER>.I could blab on like everybody else about how good the actors were in this film, but I'll spare you, because the real genius  is M. Night Shyamala (Writer, Director and played the doctor in the film). He deserves and Oscar for writing and directing one of the best screen plays in recent memory.
Cheers to you M. Night Shyamala!!The spirit of Rod Serling is alive and well!!",10,0,0,10 September 1999
