The Blair Witch Project," You need to use your imagination...
","This movie was really nice in the way it forced people to use their imagination and dig in their deepest fears, without the 'full visual package' we usually see in hollywood horror productions. Inventive and original, one of the best of its kind.",8,0,1,24 October 1999
