Miracle," The Best Sports Movie ever
",I wasn't alive for the miracle on ice but this movie makes it seem like I was. I can't imagine anybody that would not love this movie.  This movie sent shivers down my whole body multiple times.  It does a great job putting you there on game day.  Highly recommended for people of all ages.,8,0,0,16 February 2004
