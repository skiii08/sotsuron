Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's not the movie that disappoints it is the media...
","Those of you who have studied and appreciated Lucas' work will no doubt ponder this chapter in the Star Wars Saga.  You will no doubt see the signifigance of Episode I and appreciate the time and energy placed into it. As a devoted fan of Star Wars, I am completely satisfied with the latest effort.  Lucas has provided us (SW Junkies) with an overwhelming amount of facts, trivia, and information. Those of you who are not the undying fans mentioned above, will no doubtly be highly disappointed.  It is not the 'Best Picture' nominated movie we have all seen and know.  It is the unfortunate product of over-publicity. It is quite probable that in the most remote corner of the Artic, word has reached of this long-awaited movie.  Let's face it...This is a big event in entertainment history and some peoples personal issues.  Yet, there is no way any movie could live up to the expectations put forth by the media.",Null,0,0,26 May 1999
