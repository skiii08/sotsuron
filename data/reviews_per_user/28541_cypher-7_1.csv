Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Too good to talk about
",I must say that this movie was so great that I'm even having trouble commenting on it!!!  This movie deserves to take over Titanic's spot as the #1 highest grossing movie to ever hit the box office.  I've seen it seven times and I'm planning on seeing it again.  I suggest all of you IMDb users do the same.,10,0,0,1 August 1999
