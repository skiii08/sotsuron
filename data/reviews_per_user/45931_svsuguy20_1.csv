Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I cant believe they put this movie in the same category as the first 3
","Star Wars:Episode One        **(out of four)I've been disappointed before when watching a movie, but not like I was after watching this one. This movie was pry the biggest upset of all time.
The character developement was the worst part of this movie. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor (two talented actors) are wasted in the roles of Qui-Gon and Ben Kenobi, respectively. I didnt care for a minute what was happening to them for a minute. Lloyd was a miscast as Anakin due to the fact that he cant act (remember 'Jingle All the Way'). Darth Maul,pry the coolest looking villian in a long time, is hardly in the movie which was the biggest disappointment as far as characters go. Darth Vader was on the screen over and over again, which really made us fear him. Darth Mal, on the other hand, is just there for the formula. Im not even going to discuss Jar Jar Binks(how annoying was that?)There wasnt a single, credible performance.The special effects(FX) in this movie are absolutely amazing,its too bad that George Lucas decided to base the whole movie around them. I cant stand a movie that is drowned in FX (example: 'The Haunting(1999)').  Once again,we come back to Jar Jar Binks(I promised myself not to get into it about that guy).The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 was because of the great sound track. John Williams is the master of intense music. Perhaps thats the only aspect of the movie that kept me awake. To all those who love the 'last' 3 episodes, I strong suggest you veer from this one. And to all those who enjoyed this movie, watch the previous 3 and realize how dumb 'Phantom Menace' really is.",Null,0,1,17 April 2000
