The Devil's Advocate," Complex, clever law career film with a twist
","I've missed seeing this film a couple of times but chose it in favour of Good Will Hunting last night.Excellent, gripping, well written with capable acting.In most thrillers one is inundated with gore and 'plastic' CGIs, this film is far more skillfully constructed than the normal pap.The characters may not be brilliantly formed and Al Pachino was basically playing as the character in Scent of a Woman but I throughly enjoyed this film and would recommend it for good Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. night viewing.Nice one.",8,0,0,19 June 2000
The Wedding Singer," Funny, slushy, enjoyable romance/comedy/music film
","Yes I'm another UK person who hadn't seen Adam Sandler before (or since) but who thoroughly enjoyed this untaxing, light film.  Great '80's scenes and music that made me pine for the olden days where dressing like Madonna was acceptable... nay expected, at school discos, etc.Drew Barrymore who is normally such an unsympathetic character, really is sweet and pretty as Julia, with only a slightly irritating way of clapping her hands together when she is happy or gets her own way.With apologies to his mother and wife, Adam Sandler is not at all physically attractive but Robbie does have puppy dog eyes and a good, kind, caring heart which is so much more important than anything else.We all know what will happen in this film - what counts is how it arrives at it's conclusion.There are very clear cut characters who you will identify immediately. Some sad bits, some frustrating bits but mostly happy parts.Enjoy but don't expect your life to be changed.",7,1,1,13 April 2000
