Iron Man 3," iron man 3 roxxx
","took the wife and kids to the imax! we all loved it . action, dialog , and storyline , all very well done. gonna go again .amc 24 in highlands ranch Colorado was a great place to experience the latest sequel. also caught about eight trailers while we were waiting. were gonna be broke with all the new releases. back to iron man, there are many action sequences, some racy moments for the kids but nothing too serious. some references to past iron man movies were really cool. as always the special effects are mind blowing. the imax sound and giant screen really pulls you in, awesome! lots of laughs, intrigue and twists. and it would not be a marvel movie without the traditional end of credits scene. leave your problems behind and go enjoy a great movie.",Null,4,8,4 May 2013
