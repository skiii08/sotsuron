One Hundred and One Dalmatians," One of my favorites from Disney
",I love dogs and I love London so it only makes sense that I love this movie so much. I thought the twilight bark was interesting for some reason. The story is simple yet entertaining with an iconic villain. This classic will never get old for me.,10,2,2,15 November 2018
Wayne's World," Classic fun movie
",The main reason why I watched this movie in the first place was because it takes place in Chicago which is probably my favorite city.This movie makes me feel good and there's a lot of good actors who are really funny.,9,0,0,23 November 2018
Zootopia," Way better than I expected!!!
","Not surprisingly, the animation is excellent especially when Judy is on the train going to Zootopia, there are some mature themes in this movie such as racism and drugs so this movie can be enjoyable for both kids and adults. Also, I was not expecting the awesome twist ending.",10,4,5,10 November 2018
42," Well directed movie
",I really liked the acting in this movie and the way the baseball gameplay was filmed. Ford is my favorite actor and he was excellent in the movie.,8,1,2,11 November 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Very entertaining!!
",This movie isn't critically 'a masterpiece' but it sure is fun to watch. Every time Jack Sparrow was on screen he was fantastic and the ocean scenery was beautiful. I can definitely see myself watching this movie for years to come.,10,0,1,11 November 2018
Home Alone," Childhood classic Christmas movie
",Kevin McCallister is part of a huge family including his big brother Buzz and his uncle Frank and he feels that everyone is against him because his parents don't like his behavior and he gets sent up to the attic and wishes he never had to see his family again.Kevin is accidentally left home alone while his family is on vacation and of course he is very happy about making his family disappear but now he has to defend himself and his house from two burglars.This is a funny and well directed movie with great preformances and it will never get old.,10,3,4,15 November 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Boring
",I think this movie is too long and it doesn't really make sense.,3,0,2,21 November 2018
The Terminator," Amazing and entertaining
",This is a true 80s classic and I personally like it more than T2 (even though T2 is also amazing) The action sequences are awesome and Sarah Conner is pretty hot.,10,4,6,21 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," It was great but also not as good as New Hope or Empire Strikes Back
",This film was a ton of fun but it's the worst movie in the original trilogy.,10,1,3,20 November 2018
"Monsters, Inc."," Possibly my favorite Pixar movie
","This is a hilarious, fast paced fun movie about a little girl who gets into the monster world with Mike and Sully. Sully's bond with Boo (the girl) is probably the best thing about the movie. I also loved the character of Randall and the scene where they're flying around hanging onto doors is very entertaining.",10,1,1,15 November 2018
Justice League," Another generic superhero movie
",At times this movie is really entertaining but I doubt that i'll ever watch this movie again. The characters were good but the plot was pretty bad and the CGI wasn't great either. I know that they had to change the director which probably didn't help but still.,5,0,3,10 November 2018
Lilo & Stitch," Ohana means family
",This movie is so relaxing for me to watch. The relationship between Lilo and Nani is so pure and realistic. Hawaii always interested me as a place and the music in this movie is so good.,10,1,1,24 November 2018
The Shining," Best horror movie ever!!
",Stanley Kubrick makes you feel uneasy throughout the whole movie from the iconic opening scene with them driving all the way to the photograph in the last shot of the movie. The Shining has some of the best camera work and cinematography I have ever seen and Jack Nickolson in this movie is one of the best acting preferences I have ever seen. Danny Lloyd gives one of the best child acting preferences of all time. This movie is incredibly complex and many people have developed different theories as to what this movie means. The Shinning is a gift that keeps on giving.,10,3,5,15 November 2018
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Great directing in this movie.
","A lot of people will tell you this is the best Harry Potter movie, and there's a good reason for that. This is when the series went from enjoyable fun kids movies to a darker and more mature tone suited more for young adults.",10,1,1,15 November 2018
The Lego Movie," Creative and entertaining
","This movie surprised me, it wasn't just a way to sell toys for kids. I grew up playing with legos so obviously I was looking forward to this movie. The voice acting/characters were great and the animation was probably even better.",9,0,0,23 November 2018
Inside Out," Loved it!!
","The thing I liked most about Inside Out was that it made me feel very nostalgic and it made me think about my entire life. Both kids and adults will enjoy this movie.The emotion characters were really good too, I thought it was hilarious whenever Anger went into rage mode and at first I didn't like Sadness but then I realized i'm not supposed to like her...because she's sad. The ending was amazing and it almost made me cry.",10,4,9,10 November 2018
Good Will Hunting," Very impressive movie
",The most impressive thing to me about the movie was that Ben and Matt wrote the script. This film is also well directed and well acted.,9,0,1,18 November 2018
The Incredibles," One of the best from Pixar
",The Incredibles is a funny and very entertaining original story about a family of superheroes. This is one of the most mature Pixar movies (if not THE most) with certain themes in the story and action and is incredibly entertaining.,10,1,1,15 November 2018
Cars 2," Maybe Pixar's worst
","Cars 2 is something that shouldn't be a movie released in theaters, it should've been just another Mator short story. This movie was overall pretty boring.",7,0,0,16 November 2018
Coco," Beautiful film
","The animation and the colors in this movie were gorgeous and although i'm not mexican, I was really enjoying learning a little more about mexican culture such as the music, food and traditions. The story and plot are both incredible especially because of the backstories that were being told and it has a lot of surprises including the twist ending.",10,2,4,11 November 2018
The Dark Knight," RIP Heath Ledger
","Nolan did an incredible job with the realistic aspect of The Dark Knight and the soundtrack is also amazing. All of the acting was great in this movie, but Heath Ledger as the Joker was on a different level because this is the best acting preformance I have ever seen and if it wasn't for him, The Dark Knight would not be a masterpiece and one of my favorite movies ever (it would still be really good though).",10,0,1,17 November 2018
The Dark Knight," A true masterpiece
",This is one of my favorite movies of all time and a lot of it has to do with Heath Ledger as the joker because that is the best acting I have ever seen. There's so many memorable scenes including the bank robery scene and the interrogation scene. I'm amazed at how well Nolan directed this movie.,10,0,1,15 November 2018
Toy Story," So much nostalgia :)
",Toy Story is a really fun movie to watch especially for kids and the story is so good.,10,1,1,16 November 2018
Beauty and the Beast," It grew on me :) A lot better than I expected
",The first time I watched it I was pretty bored but then the next day I had the urge to watch it again and I liked it way more the second time.I've really liked Emma Watson ever since the Harry Potter movies and in this movie she wasn't just beautiful but she actually added depth to the character of Belle. The CGI for the beast usually looked really good but at times it looked very average. The relationship between Belle and The Beast was a lot more believable than the original animated movie. Gaston was played very well in this movie and any scene with him in it was fun. The household objects were very good with portraying human emotions.,10,5,10,10 November 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Disappointing
","I don't think I was interested even for a single scene in this movie. It definitely was relying too much on humor which got old very fast. I didn't care about any of the characters some of the plot is ridiculous. It's not terrible, it just wasn't entertaining for me personally.",3,1,1,23 November 2018
Monsters University," A good prequel!
","First of all Monsters Inc. is my favorite Pixar movie ever so I was nervous about watching this one.Monsters University focuses more on Mike and his dream to be a scarer and at school he meets Sully (which is weird because in the first movie it's told they knew each other in 4th grade).Although this prequel wasn't really necessary and it's not as clever as the first movie back in 2001, it was still enjoyable to watch and I would definitely want to watch it again.",8,0,0,19 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Never gets old
",This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that will be loved forever. The special affects are so good for 1977 and the soundtrack for this movie is amazing.,10,8,9,19 November 2018
Apollo 13," Well directed film
","This film is very impressive mostly because of the editing and directing, the actors did a fantastic job and the story is very good. I also don't think there was ever a boring part where they dragged on for longer than they had to. The soundtrack was also really good for the movie.I would definitely watch this movie again.",9,0,1,23 November 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," One of the best movies ever!
",The Empire Strikes Back has entertained and will continue to entertain people of all ages for years to come. This movie is so iconic in every way.,10,1,2,20 November 2018
Incredibles 2," Definitely not as good as the first Incredibles movie
","Good: The animation for this movie was excellent just like most other Pixar movies, it was funny (especially Jack Jack) and I really liked the action sequences throughout the movie. I liked that the movie showed that parenting (when done right) can be heroic.Bad: I thought this film has quite a few problems, the biggest problem was that the ending was pretty predictable, I could see it coming. Also, there was a feminism theme with Helen which was okay but at times it seemed to shove it in my face and it got to be annoying. There seemed to be a little too much going on in the movie and a few too many characters.I'm glad I saw the movie, I just don't think I would see it again anytime soon.",6,195,270,10 November 2018
