Iron Man 3," Downey Jr. does his best without The Avengers
","Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III. The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers? The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time. It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time. So, how do you follow that kind of success? The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success – at least for any other comic book film, that is. We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it? The answer to that question is: momentum. Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine. Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film – well, we have that answer for you.Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks. Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States. One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire – which quickly gains Stark's attention. At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an 'explosive' new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis. Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr. Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress. The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions. Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley – who is nothing short of treat in this film. They couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character). Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark – just because he's smarter than everyone else. Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting character addition to the franchise.Now – here's the good, the bad, and the ugly. First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight. If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption. The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers. If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Pine, or Chris Hemsworth – you'll be very disappointed. Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance. And, the ugly has to start with an apology. Sorry, kids – there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy (unless Shane Black decides to add another scene after the fact, like Joss Whedon in The Avengers). This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be. Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of the Empire Strikes Back. He gets an ass kicking in this film that just keeps on giving. However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films. For the average movie-goer, Iron Man is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy. Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning – in the grand scheme of things – Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers. Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) – yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013.",6,0,4,28 April 2013
Oblivion," Sci-fi Top Gun for Cruise in 'Oblivion'
","Over the course of the last few years, the science fiction genre of film has either provided major hits or complete misses. Depending on who's acting and who's directing, movie-goes appear to be fairly picky about which sci-fi films they're willing to spend their money on. In 2012, Prometheus took us back to the Aliens universe with critical and commercial success, while at the same time, Battleship and John Carter sank – ultimately drowning in a sea of misery. Speaking of sci-fi success, Tom Cruise has been a part of a handful of lucrative sci-fi endeavors, including Minority Report, Vanilla Sky, and War of the Worlds. Now, Tom Cruise is back once again with another pre-summer box office smash, Oblivion.Directed by Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Lecacy), Oblivion stars Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, one of the few remaining survivors of the planet earth – half of which has been destroyed and deemed uninhabitable after a nuclear war with an alien species, known as Scavs (Scavengers). Harper, along with his partner and love interest, Victoria (Andrea Riseborough), are in charge of an operation to salvage and extract the last of earth's natural resources, prior to leaving earth and rejoining their fellow humans on a massive space station, called Titan. However, everything is not as it seems when Jack saves a woman, Julia (Olga Kurylenko) from the wreckage of a crash-landing – the same woman whom he has been having recurring memories and dreams. And, after making contact with the Scavs, Jack must uncover the secrets behind the organization for which he has been working and the reasoning behind his absent memory (which was mandatorily removed) . Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo also star in supporting roles.First and foremost, do not leave the theater when you see this film – and you absolutely should see this film. Oblivion is one of the films that will require your attention at all times, because it's extremely easy to miss a giant piece of the puzzle during a bathroom break or popcorn run. The film's plot is relatively easy to decipher by the conclusion of the film, however, there's more going on in this film that you can possibly interpret in one sitting. The introduction of the film crams a whole lot of information into your head to set up the present conundrum being tackled by Cruise's character, Jack Harper. Clearly, he's involved in a snatch-n-grab job, hastily attempting to remove earth's resources, while attempting to avoid any difficulties or interaction with the supposed villains, the Scavs. However, it's impossible to get specific about the majority of the film's plot points without spoiling the film.Oblivion's cast is one of the most impressive features in this film and remains tremendously authentic from beginning to end in this enigmatic drama. Tom Cruise hasn't been this enjoyable in quite a long time and really finds his groove with his character. Reminiscent of the character from War of the Worlds, Jack Harper is mostly in the dark about the majority of the occurrences in this film and is often in over his head – yet somehow always manages to come out of each dire situation unscathed. On the other hand, his partner (Victoria) constantly finds new ways to be jealous in a world where she has absolutely no competition. At times, she can become an annoyance, but that's mostly due in large part to lack of her unwillingness to think outside the box (which is reserved solely for Tom Cruise's character). Finally, let's face the fact here – everything is better with Morgan Freeman.By far and away, the most enjoyable moments of the film revolve around the CGI action sequences – which include some very intriguing and well-designed drones. These drones are the main agitators in a rather Empire Strikes Back-like flight batter which is also a nice flashback to Tom Cruise sitting in a cockpit in Top Gun. It's unclear whether or not the filmmakers meant to create a throwback sci-fi Top Gun-style chase scene, but regardless, this specific flight chase will have you wishing for a Top Gun sequel (which was sadly canceled after the death of its original director, Tony Scott).Overall, there's absolutely nothing in Oblivion that hasn't been done in some other sci-fi before it. Sure, it would be easy to say this is just another post-apocalyptic film with alien invaders, ultimately forcing humanity to unite for a greater good to defeat them. Yet, this film is much more complex than your average space-invaders film. It provides a busier (occasionally confusing) than usual plot (in Prometheus fashion), so if you look away, you'll most likely miss something important. But, if you play close enough attention to the plot points, you'll be able to tie everything together in a nice, pretty bow when the credits role – hopefully coming to the conclusion that Oblivion is a perfectly fun and enjoyable sci-fi film.Overall Film Grade: A-",8,2,5,21 April 2013
The Purge," 'The Purge' a theme-driven attack on America?
","Films that make political statements aren't anything new, nor are they a revolutionary means of gaining otherwise unlikely attention. Controversy has always been a means for creating revenue, especially in the United States where people tend to flock to scandalous news stories. But, before you come after me for generalizing, hear me out. The Purge, which is the subject of controversy due to comments made by James DeMonaco in relation to The Tea Party and NRA, appear to have stirred quite the commotion for a film that would typically never register on the average movie-goer's radar. But, when roughly one-third of the United States is clearly conservative, attacking their base with a overbearingly apocalyptic film seems like a great way to aggravate that one-third, while still forcing them to go see the film in order to figure out what all the talk is about. When you take that logic into account, mix it with a liberally-charged subject matter and the unremarkably high interest for blood-spillage from teenagers and young adults, you have quite the cocktail for success.The Purge, directed by James DeMonaco (Staten Island), stars Ethan Hawke as James Sandin, a home security developer that sells security systems to home owners in anticipation of a yearly 12-hour period, called 'The Purge.' During the 12 hour window, the New Founding Fathers of America (government) allow Americans to 'purge' themselves of crime, hate, and murder by legalizing these acts (with certain exceptions). James Sandin and his wife, Mary (Lena Headey), along with their two kids, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Henry (Tony Oller), decide to stay in for 'the purge,' believing in its cause, but not partaking in the events. However, the evening of The Purge takes a turn for the worst when Henry aids a bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge) begging for salvation outside the Sandin's residence. The man's assailants, including the cryptic polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield), demand his release before they 'purge' the entire Sandin family, also. Arija Bareikis and Chris Mulkey also star in supporting roles.It's difficult to watch this film without focusing on the underlying themes that are completely in your face for its entirety. The idiotic rational featured in this film states that America is better off if its citizens are given a 12 hour window to commit atrocities. On the flip side, the government believes that if Americans are given this 12-hour window of 'freedom,' it alleviates crime and promotes job growth, along with economic prosperity for the remaining 364 days of the year. Still, it's bothersome to think that people can simply go on a 12-hour crime/killing spree, and just go back to their regular lives the following day without any carry over. They say once you've killed the first time, it's likely you'll do it again. However, with that logic in mind, it's difficult to imagine any of these individuals would be able to wait a full year to kill or commit a crime again. This film obviously gives the mind plenty to contemplate and it certainly creates a different way of thinking about the future direction of civilization. Regardless, the film's premise is a complete and utter rip-off of the classic 1967 Star Trek episode, The Return of the Archons, in which an evil dictator rewards his minions with a similar 12-hour window to pillage and plunder an entire planet's civilians.Themes aside, there's very little about The Purge that separates itself from the array of unlawful entry films, not to mention the classic slasher films featuring Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. The abundance of stupid mistakes and clichés (like characters that still hide under the bed) really hurt this film, especially in the later half after the film turns into more a 'so stupid it's funny' horror flick than a spine-tingling thriller. For instance, if the son hadn't invited the random stranger into his house, the whole situation could have been avoided. Of course, that wouldn't make for a very interesting movie – but it always takes something away from the film when the majority of viewers don't believe the situation is visible, especially in the horror genre. Fror there, there's a series of irritating questions, like why are a large group of blood-thirsty individuals hell bent on 'purging' spending so much time on won random bum/war veteran. It makes the film feel like a whole lot of wasted time with very little reward.To be honest, the lack of star-power hasn't been a very big concern for the horror genre. However, The Purge's leading man, Ethan Hawke, is far from an unrecognizable face. Surprisingly, Hawke makes an enjoyable protagonist, but he just lacked the proper antagonist in this film. His nemesis for the film, credited as the 'polite stranger' is reminiscent of a watered-down version of Heath Ledger's joker persona. If the joker were 15 years younger and starring in a CW version of Batman, he may have resembled the performance of the relatively unknown Rhys Wakefield. And, to be honest, the kid (Henry) is rather creepy in the film, even though he turns out to be utterly harmless. Tony Oller's portrayal is commendable, and even though he had the look of a future Michael Myers follower, (small spoiler) he turns out to be the voice of reason in the family's darkest hour.Overall, The Purge is a silly movie filled with a ton of potshots at America. The film is chock-full of liberal bias, but is it anti-American? Well, that's a matter of personal opinion, but the fact that a film like this can be made (even if the director is using his own personal criticism) means the First Amendment is alive and well.",6,2,3,8 June 2013
