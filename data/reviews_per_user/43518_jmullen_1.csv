Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Phenomenal. Don't worry the critics are Braindead, have been since ANH. 'Have you ever encountered a jedi night before......we will not survive this'
","Well this movie proves two things.  That Lucas is the greatest movie creator of all time and that critics don't watch the movies they write articles about.  I've seen the movie 8 times in its first week and have to say that it was perfect.  I would have not started the saga out any differently. If you had problems with it go see it again (as well as the original trilogy), amazing.  The acting was flawless.  Many might ask What About Jar Jar?? Well Jar Jar was just fine he fit into the story perfectly and is a great first step for a character that will develop greatly over the next three, ask anyone who is not between 16 and 30 and they will most likely say that Jar Jar was one of their favorite characters.  Also I have never seen a movie cut like Phantom was.  I believe this is the reason most people are saying go see it twice before you rate it.  The movie moves so fast and jumps around so much in order to give you all that you can handle in two hours and 15 minutes that you literally have to see it twice just so it can all sink in.  Because of this Episode 1 has the best multi-viewing potential out of the saga.  If you haven't seen Episode 1 yet don't worry, it will be out in the theaters for at least another 6 months.  Let's see if it can break 1 billion domestically.  After this weekend it will be where titanic was two and a half months after it's release.  The attitude that pretty much sums up the movie would be 'are you braindead I'm not going in there with two jedi, send a driod' or better yet 'Have you ever encountered a jedi night before......we will not survive this'",10,0,0,26 May 1999
