Requiem for a Dream," Visually painful, intellectually void
","What I miss in this film is the attempt to address difficult social questions about drugs. Instead we are treated as Pavlov's dogs: drugs=bad, drugs=filth, drugs=pain, drugs=ugly, etc. All this may be true, but does that really suffice to make a film? No, I answer. For example, why not try to address the question WHY do these people in one way or another do what they do, why do they inflict these things upon themselves? What drives them? And why not try to put drug addiction in a bigger picture? Who gains from this abuse, why does a society accept that many of its citizens are paralyzed at their television sets, doped by drugs, completely consumed by their need or engaged in small gang wars (small in comparison to what governments do)? I do not say that one single film should address all these questions, but a drug film above the ordinary must see beyond the individual. This one fails in that respect, thus making it uncontroversial (the nudity and sex scenes are filthy and terribly voyeuristic, but I do not consider them to be controversial except to a very prude audience), which probably is the reason why it has been so well received... no one in power is criticized, it is the addict which is the loser, end of story.The film has some inventive visual effects and some good acting, but form can not make up for lack of challenging content. So I end up with 2/10.",2,12,24,29 July 2006
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," masochistic and manipulative
","I have seen many of Loach films, and I like them, some a lot! But this one, stands out for being one-dimensional and with a sledgehammer-like rhetoric.So what do I mean? We get to follow a young man through the film, who only after five minutes into the film becomes convinced that an armed struggle is the best way to beat the oppression. Then the film follows his violent actions. And after many minutes (some with very masochistic and self-sacrificing violence) the British occupation force is ousted.Now (at last) the film is getting ready to address issues of greater difficulty, because suddenly with the disappearance of the common enemy, the fighters start to disagree. Should the fight continue until a worker's socialist republic is formed, or should a liberal democracy with some ties to the British (but not occupied) be accepted? Our protagonist chooses the former option. At this point in the film (unless the repetitive first hour and a half has bored you completely) the real challenge to the audience could be given: how can a people with different opinions on how to live and structure society, reach a common ground for their mutual existence, how should a socialist state deal with persons that does not want to join the collective, now when their occupier has left? The film has a clear answer: they are traitors, lets fight to the End! Here the personal drama, which is where Loach has his great power, is substituted for very simple political discourse. No intellectual 'tension' is built up because the answer appears so simple... FIGHT! And the ending... so masochistic! You almost wonder if the violence is the (erotic?) force of the film. Of all films Loach has made over the years, that this one would win in Cannes... well, you can not help but question the taste of the jury!",1,26,58,22 September 2006
