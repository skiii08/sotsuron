Requiem for a Dream," 58 on the 250 top movies?
","Uhm.. yeah... this movie was horrendous. I do not recommend it unless you like puking.I personally do not like to watch people being tortured by electro-shock therapy... but hey, that's just me.I also do not like story lines that make no sense. drooling drugs addicts are not on my list of things I need to see.I honest to God say this is the worst movie I have *ever* seen.the message of the movie is 'Don't do drugs'. there... I just saved you 2 long disgusting hours. Go out in the sun and embrace life. Don't watch this horrifically unnecessary waste of shelf space in a movie store. Or... go ahead and watch it. make sure you have a puke bucket near by.",1,6,14,23 February 2007
