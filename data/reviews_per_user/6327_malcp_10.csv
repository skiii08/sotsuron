Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Time will tell on this epic work
","Perhaps I'm getting old, but dragging such a two bit story line out over two films without offering anything other than rather hackneyed tributes to numerous other movies and Tarantino's now rather repetitive slapstick violence, seemed to me rather akin to making a 24 hour long tribute to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (yes I know some people would welcome that but...).Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs are indisputably classics, but anyone who thinks either of the two Kill Bill films are in the same league obviously haven't seen enough Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan movies. This movie would perhaps have worked better as a computer game.",4,4,8,28 March 2006
Skyfall," It's a good Bond film
","OK, the story is no more or less plausible than previous episodes in the series. Perhaps it has a harder edge, with a line of coffins draped in Union Jacks and faux news coverage of summary executions filmed on hand-held cameras mimicking all too familiar real life events. What is unfortunate is that the legacy of this series, injects softness where there should be none and implausibility where mere spectacle is no longer enough. The legacy demands that Bond is portrayed as a heroic figure, but coldly, there is little in this tale that is heroic. The dichotomy for the writers is delivering a convincing narrative about this secret agent, when little that drove the invention of the character and his 'glamour' has any meaningful relevance to the job such an agent would need to do in today's world. We've know this for years of course, and the problem is perhaps the biggest challenge to face anyone who wants to continue the succession. There are few films in cinema history that are nicer to look at than this one, but if you want to get the most out of the film, don't bother trying to connect too many of the dots in the story. It's not Shawshank, The Godfather or Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a GOOD James Bond film!",7,4,7,9 October 2017
Lone Survivor," Jingoistic , violent, and ultimately a school-boy war comic
","First of all I have the greatest respect for the real soldiers that this film purports to represent. The training depicted during the introductory titles tests them to the limit and sometimes beyond. Throw them down a mountain though in the way that we see demonstrated in this film not once but twice, and they will break. Shoot them in the head and they will die. Stick bullet holes in them and they will pass out from shock or from blood loss. Fill their legs with huge chunks of shrapnel and they won't be able to walk. Somehow his film seems to have bypassed a reality check by many viewers, I can't think of any other reason it scores so highly. The action is brutal and intense, but also constructed in a way that should be absurdly unbelievable for most people over the age of 15. The characterisation makes Top Gun look like a work of Shakespeare and the gung-ho sacrifice of a Chinook full of soldiers forced on at gunpoint into the battle by one of their own ranks right up there with Major Kong riding the bomb in Dr Strangelove. Watch Come and See if you want to know what war is like, and watch Top Gun if you just want entertainment. The only people I'd recommend this one for is for sound-editors and mixers.",4,3,5,3 January 2017
Memento," New spin on a old tale, but Guy Pearce is wonderful
","Another one of those films I came to with very high hopes after lots of personal recommendations and high plaudits in reviews etc. etc. etc. but came away slightly disappointed. Perhaps years of reading 'twist in the tale' novels by people like Jeffrey Deaver has made me more immured from excitement of this type of thing, I don't know. I didn't guess the ending, but then like an episode of Taggart, it didn't reveal sufficient plot details along the way to enable you to do this. On the other hand the punchline didn't knock me off my feet either. The best I can say about the story is that it was better than The Usual Suspects (and I did guess the end in that). I was disappointed that the writer or director felt the need to include a scene where a drink exposes just how goldfish-like the hero's memory is. We'd already established that and the scene added nothing to the story other than a eewww moment, but other than that, every little rewind of the story and extra exposure of the plot fitted and worked well. Still, at the end of it all, I couldn't help feeling so what? Guy Pearce filled a character without any depth with real depth. Partially helped by a great physique and some intriguing tattoos, although we knew almost nothing of his character other than his plight, you were driven to watch as he made an otherwise unbelievable character perfectly believable. Ultimately though, just because we believe he could be real, that isn't the same as caring what might happen to him and for all it's clever twisting, take away the superb performance of Guy Pearce and we're left with a rather gimmicky plot rather than a classic film.",7,0,1,3 August 2011
Crash," A well acted reflection on the human condition
","Taken superficially, this film would seem to be all about blatant racism and if you only look at it in that context you will miss the point. To quote a rather hackneyed phrase; 'Too err is human' and the one thing that this cast portray better than anything else is in this picture is that we all err, whether intentionally or not. We judge people and situations by any number of preconceived ideas and the only thing that reflects is the narrowness of our own vision. Our actions are more often motivated by self-interest than selflessness and yet we condemn others for behaving in exactly the same way. Many of the roles in this film can be seen as stereotypes, but it is not because of how they behave, it is because that is how they are seen through the eyes of the other characters in the film. These are not real people, and it would be easier if we did live in a world that's this tightly linked and clear cut, but despite life's complexities, our views on other people and especially those with any identifiable difference; whether age, race, creed or colour are more often than not just as simplistic, stereotyped and pathetically naive. This film's only failure from my perspective is that too many of the leads do find a redemption of sorts. If only life were really that simple.",9,1,6,27 October 2006
Rush," The Niki Lauda story
","In many ways this reminded me of those biopics that were made in the early 1950s. An undercurrent of fact mixed with a large dose of hogwash. The reality of the Hunt vs Lauda battle was a cracking story and I remember following it at the time, but most of the film left me cold - possibly because of a truly abysmal portrayal of James Hunt, but also the rather paltry amount of awfully CGI track action and the fact that every facet of the story was portrayed in a very naff stereotypical fashion. In fact were it not for a masterful performance by Daniel Brühl who really does capture some of the essence of Niki Lauda, I'd have probably scored the film a couple of points lower. I was hoping this would be a racing film that might finally outshine Grand Prix, instead, its really only slightly more watchable than Bobby Deerfield.",6,1,5,25 April 2014
The Italian Job," Surprisingly good
","If like me, you were expecting a mediocre remake of the Michael Caine film, then this film should come as a pleasant surprise. Aside from a brief shot of 1960's Michael Caine on a TV in one shot, most connections are nominal and the only logical explanation for any attempt to tie-in to the first film must be to do with financial support from BMW for the inclusion of their 'new' Mini. In fact I found this about the only bit of the film that never really rang true, it's explained away because of the width of a corridor the gang need to drive down. However, unlike the first film where the original Mini was a quintessential element in the 'swinging London' British theme of the film and where its presence seemed logical with the England football team playing in Italy. In the new film any car of a similar size would have done the trick and using brand new red, white and blue Minis could only make the gang stand out like a sore thumb. Still, the pace is good, the actions flowing and the speedboat and helicopter stunt work are particularly notable. Whatever it's merits or otherwise, this film couldn't have anything like the impact the original Italian Job had when it was first shown, but if you watch the original now it does seem very dated. If you enjoyed Ocean's Eleven, then you'll enjoy this as well.",7,2,3,12 July 2011
Black Hawk Down," Call of Duty with a bit of bromance
","Very slightly more sophisticated than John Wayne's Green Berets, this is a gung-ho action packed patriotic thriller 'based on real events'. Like COD, it's pretty accurate in it's depiction of weapon usage and clearly shows that through succeeding in its aim to 'leave no man behind', we may be loosing the battle but winning the war. We know at the end, that this particular episode wasn't a great victory for the USA. But hey ho, every US soldier who died is a brave hero listed by name at the end of the film, the hundreds of Somali's were just cannon fodder and clearly every single one was a savage committed to the cause. Were all the Somalis on the same side? Who cares. Where did their weapons come from? Who cares. The one thing I do remember from media coverage of the actual conflict was footage of some of the bodies of American soldiers captured during the battle being dragged through the streets. Clearly this would have distracted from this 'accurate' portrayal which rather than being heralded as a graphic representation of real events, should be more widely recognised as a recruiting flag-waver. If it didn't pretend to be something its not, then as an action thriller, it is well crafted and I would have given it higher marks. But people have been led to believe it is more than that, and that is really unforgivable.",6,0,1,28 December 2016
Les Misérables," Too close to the stage musical?
","I do love the story and have watched most of the filmed versions that have appeared over the years with the Gerard Depardieu version being my own favourite. Financially this film has been a great success, I just wish they had worked harder to make the most of what a cinematic version might offer and it could have been another Oliver or West Side Story, but sadly it's not. So few musicals appear to work to fully utilise the medium of film and this one fails on many counts. 1. if your actors can't sing, don't force them to perfom long and avoidable solos! Poor Hugh Jackman did his best, but even an actor of his calibre can't compensate for such a long and unflattering spotlight. 2.Intersperse the songs with other stuff! 10 minutes of action does not mean the next 40 minuites can be overlooked. 3.Give people rousing choruses that they can sing along to. This film almost managed it, but felt the need to change track every time it got close. 4.You don't need to get your actors to sing every single bit of dialog. I think someone cottoned on to this about 3/4 of the way through, but then thought better of it. As it stands, this version is about an hour too long. i just hope its scale doesn't put anyone off from making another musical version some time in the future as it could be so much better than this.",6,1,1,24 February 2018
Gangs of New York," Disappointing bland thuggery
","Excellent performances from the cast fail to compensate for the fact that this whole story is so badly focused that the whole thing becomes a bit of a non-event. The events that led up to the opening battle between the Priest and the Butcher with that battle as the movies climax might at least have given a more rounded tale, but instead you have a bunch of interesting characters in interesting settings swimming around in a very thin story of thuggery and corruption that goes nowhere and is about as powerful and moving as a WWF wrestling match. This may be historically accurate, but that alone doesn't make it interesting. If you haven't been to see it yet, save your money and wait for the video!",2,3,9,24 January 2003
