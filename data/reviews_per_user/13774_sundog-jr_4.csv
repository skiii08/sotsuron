The Benchwarmers," What The Hell...
","The Benchwarmers could have been so much better. Probably not good, but much better than it was. First of all, if you're going to watch this, you have to force yourself through the first thirty minutes or so, because it's all about young teens and pre-teens being bullied relentlessly and it's painful to watch at times. Their cruelty is played for humor, and a lot of the time it's not even remotely funny, but appalling and offensive. If you've ever been bullied, which is everyone at some point in time in your childhood, it especially offends you. But, after the thirty minutes of hell, it actually gets better. not much, but better enough to the point where you can actually watch it without cringing. Sadly, this is the best part of the movie. The bullies get their just desserts in the end (how shocking) and it's fun to see them pay, almost comical at times, but once it gets to the end, everything turns completely sappy. The bullies are smiling and pitching balls to the kids they bullied and purposely letting them win, and everyone's happy, and they all go out for pizza (speaking of which, this entire movie is really just a giant advertisement for Pizza Hut) but it feels so preachy and forces niceness upon you that is totally unwanted. the humor is totally crass and crude throughout, so why stop and turn it into a happy little cheese fest at the end?? If you're gonna go the crude route, go all out. that's what made certain movies like Step Brothers and Pineapple Express watchable for me, the humor was awful, but at least it was consistent. overall, The Benchwarmers leaves you with a weird taste in your mouth. Actually, my first thought after the movie was, 'What the hell just happened...'",4,0,0,27 September 2012
The Expendables," Blood, Guts, Testosterone, Terrible Lighting...
","I'm not sure if Netflix's picture quality was just bad on my TV, or if the movie itself's lighting was just sorry. I think it might be both... The Expendables has a serious lack of plot, which is dragged out by numerous escapades to foreign countries with beautiful scenery, (apparently a necessity for any action flick) and non-stop violence, which is supposed to make this just a good-time, man's man kind of movie. And it was when you could actually see what was going on. Sadly, more than half of the movie takes place at night, and so do the fight scenes. All you see in most of these are shaky camera angles, silhouetted fists flying, bullets randomly exploding in every direction, and crashes and grunts that are supposed to be relevant to the blacked- out action. There were a few scenes that were borderline awesome, and guess what? Those were the fight scenes that took place in the daytime, which includes a fast paced shootout, and a car chase featuring Jet Li. All in all, this movie was not supposed to be an Oscar-winner, obviously, but it was supposed to be just a violent, good time. But the camera and lighting quality was so poor that you could rarely see the fight scenes that you most likely expected to enjoy.",5,1,5,21 August 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," Whatever you're expecting, it's not that.
","Wow.I just got out of a Thursday night premier, and i have to say... I haven't had a pit of dread in my stomach leaving a Marvel movie before. Ever. The rest of the movie is great, meaningful action and development happens, it's all great.But the final stretch... It's a doozy. Like I said in the title, whatever theories you have about the end... Just throw them away. Walk into this movie with an open mind and try and prepare yourself.This is the darkest Marvel movie so far. I'm anxious to see what the Russo brothers do with Part II next year because I don't know what they're doing at all. It's great, but you will leave this film feeling emotionally ripped to shreds. And it happens like a punch in the gut. I've already said too much. Go into it without any spoilers, if you can, and just prepare yourself for Thanos.",10,3,8,27 April 2018
Joker," A sign of the times? Maybe. Hopefully not.
","Joker is disturbing. It's sick. It's nihilistic and bleak and beautiful and twisted and gut-wrenching. There's NO way this film should've made it to theaters because it's too good.I can't see any evidence of studio interference, it's uncut, unregulated pure cinema. It's exquisitely and lovingly made. I know 5 different Oscars it should win off the top of my head.However, I almost walked out twice because of how black this film is. It will make you nervous and physically uncomfortable and that's what it's supposed to do.But DO NOT let anyone tell you it's 'mindless violence' or any of that garbage. It has SO MUCH on its mind.Some people call it irresponsible. Maybe it is. Displaying a degenerate and horrifying world that some degenerate and horrifying people live in is inconvenient and uncomfortable, but it should be.It's more than just relevant. It's terrifying. And yes, Joaquin Phoenix has matched Heath Ledger's brilliant iteration. In my opinion, he surpasses it.Go see it.",10,1,2,4 October 2019
