Captain Phillips," silent hero
","Unlike other similar films, Captain Philip, did not deliberately promote the greatness of the characters. Captain Philip spent the most difficult time with the crew with extraordinary calmness. He also feared and even wept like us. The hardest thing is not to describe the brutality of the pirates, 'Why don't you do something else?' Maybe in the United States but in Africa ... This is the fact that the birth cannot be changed but determines the future destiny! The film does not have a lot of extra pavement. It does not enter the rhythm directly at the beginning and always captures the audience 's emotions Most importantly, at the same time, pity for people born in poor countries. This is the model of the main theme film.",9,1,1,11 January 2020

Detroit," i can't breath
","I can't breath! George floyd
July 23, 1967, May 25, 2020, 8pm. Fifty years later, racial discrimination and violent law enforcement by some police have not changed much. What we see is not hope but despair.
If weapons are the tools given to the police to defend justice, the violent law enforcement is indeed the trigger to turn the police into criminals. The history of racial discrimination accompanied by national development has long been deeply rooted in people's minds.
Movie art comes from life but is higher than life. I did not deliberately choose this film for 'Detroit', but as I gradually went deeper, the atmosphere of despair and suffocation made me truly understand the horror of racial discrimination and violent law enforcement. The separation between the film and reality is gradually being broken. With the wave of anti-racial discrimination in the United States, maybe those criminals were not brought to justice 50 years ago. I hope that this kind of thing does not happen today.
I hope everyone understands that racial discrimination is all harm and no benefit. Whether it is white, black, or yellow, we are all human beings with basic human rights, freedom, democracy, and fairness, which have been universal since we were born. Power. And this problem is not just a national problem, it is a problem for all of us. I know that if you don't act, the change will never come, but this change should not be to fight back with violence. This world may be so real and desperate, but I hope to quote Mr. Martin Luther King:
I have a dream today.
I dream that one day, the valley will rise, the mountain will fall, the ups and downs will be a smooth road, the Holy Light will reveal, and the world will be full!",8,0,2,14 June 2020
Memento," truth or lies what we believe
","We are only willing to believe what we are willing to believe. Memory builds the human cognitive world. Imagine if everything in this world even existed is just an imagination in our brain. The meaning of life is also based on a series of memories. Memory defines who I am, the purpose of life, and the meaning of life. It's really terrifying, even if Lenny accidentally commits a regret for life, he can only make up another story as a reason to survive. The most horrible thing is not that we will build countless lies to satisfy the truth that we believe more, but that the memories we believe are just the 'facts' that we have processed. In any case, we always need a goal to drive us to survive, but when that 'memory' is just to satisfy the story that we built, when everything is not reliable, then what else can we believe?",9,1,2,18 February 2020
Knives Out," humannity
","'Blades out of the scabbard' 'Everyone is only willing to believe the truth they see, but the real truth is there. What you need is to distinguish between the true and false.' Today, with the decline of inferential novels, Agatha Christina and her readers still create such wonderful stories for us. Just as the film title is different from general reasoning films, the screenwriter used Marta's narrative in the first half of the film to let us stand in the perspective of God to watch the progress of this story and this human drama. But the truth we think is only what we are willing to believe. The screenwriter has brought all the audience into his narrative trap. That is, what we think is not the true truth. The story of the movie is ups and downs, and it gives me a long-lost feeling that is completely like reading an inferential novel! And after perfectly telling this story, it still satirizes the most fragile and dark thing of humanity, the bug in the first half In the end, the self-consistent and echoing of the story should be the most injured marta, she had a chance to save halan. '' Drysdale's family, the evil house of the 'Deformed House', is the real family of halan. They only care about themselves and abandon their love. They mocked the immigration status of marta and claimed that it was like a family to marta but it was really harmful In their own interests, they will pull out the sharp blade to the weaker.",9,1,8,29 November 2019
The Irishman," master martain
","Although Martin has passed the peak of his creation of 'The Good Guy', as a true craftsman, he still maintains his love for the 'movie' in the heart of the movie and makes every effort to create a real 'movie'! In this impetuous People of the era have long been accustomed to Marvel's 'cinema'. It may be difficult for people to take three and a half hours to see the epic work of Martin Scorsese. The booming American gangster and Frank, the people around him were long gone, but he threw it to protect the brothers. Just like Martin, he is worthy of a true master in his insistence on art!",9,1,4,17 December 2019
Zodiac," our imagination
","Zodiac, the name of a panic killer at the time. And for people like Robert and David who have devoted their lives to this case. When the case is gradually forgotten, and everyone seems paranoid in the whole process to catch the killer, even in the end their purpose is not to catch the killer, but to find an excuse for the time they spend. The US case handling system does make it difficult for police officers to communicate better cases, which has shown hope in 'Incredible' that all criminals can be brought to justice. David Finch maintained a consistent suspense style throughout the process of handling the case, especially in the basement. The final rhythm in the early stage was perfectly controlled, but in the mid-term, there were too many clues to superimpose suspense, which made people feel that Somewhat verbose. A better way to deal with it is that 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is more compact. The Twelfth House is still David Finch's masterpiece.",8,0,1,17 January 2020
The Prestige," Do you watching closely?
","Are you seeing closely? Nolan's consistent non-linear narrative and cross-cutting did not destroy the sense of substitution of Deadly Magic, and in the end it will never be able to see the clues buried by Nolan. Nolan's film also wants to challenge the audience's thinking like magic.
What you see is notreal. Maybe you sometimes think that you have seen the truth, but you can't bear and imagine the price of success! Are you willing to make such a sacrifice? Are you really looking at it?",9,4,6,7 November 2019

The Pianist," make love no war
","War is constantly destroying our understanding of human nature, and the harm caused by racial discrimination to people will always remind us of the preciousness of peace and the fear of life. Even though the light of human nature still flashes in the war, but the war only brings suffering to mankind! The film cleverly brings us into one person, a pianist and we follow him to witness this cruel war. The restraint and ruthlessness of the movie convey to us the cruelty of war in silence!",9,0,1,28 November 2019

A Clockwork Orange," all these violent delights will have violent ends
","'These cruel joys will end in cruelty'!
Violence, painful circulation, Alex 's social instability, and unrestricted behavior he seemed to represent the purest evil, but did his evil originate from himself, or did the old man say that he lacked the most Basically, what about the 'society' that law and order can only be maintained by human fragile morals?Humans are animals that are good at disguising. We have spent our whole lives only to satisfy the society's positioning and to be a so-called good people.
Sex and violence are two aspects of human's natural desires. If we can restrain our reaction to naked desires in front of us, that is, the key to distinguishing us from primitives to moderns, perhaps it seems more civilized in this lack of barbarism In society, we live more repressive, only that he has been carefully hidden in all kinds of hypocritical social systems!
When the perpetrator and the victim exchanged, the perpetrators who became 'good people' dropped their weapons, but the knife was picked up by the victim, removed the hypocritical mask, and stabbed the perpetrator without hesitation. What about social threats?It's the opposite of things. The lowest desire is mixed with Beethoven's symphony. The most elegant music has now become endless torture. Just like Alex, he also loves Beethoven. The most beautiful 'Music in the Rain' has become the best way to express violence in his mouth. It is really ironic. Kubrick may be the most special director. He said that mixing elegance with the bottom makes the whole film full of a magical atmosphere.
Even the most rebellious Alex succumbs to political lies, which is really ironic.
When a fresh and juicy orange is fitted with a mechanical clockwork, his vitality has completely disappeared, but it runs monotonously like a walking dead every night. We may just say this is nothing in this huge social machine. Special little pinion!",9,0,2,7 May 2020
Joker," chaos
","I used to think that my life was a tragedy, and now I realize that it is a comedy. ''I think too much, or the world is getting more crazy!'' The system silently solidifies the social class, the so-called upper layer never notices their existence, making fun of them, everyone is just an incompetent clown, but When the clowns really turned into joker, Arthur was forced to face the chaos, the most common individual in the society without a trace, but when he saw himself and everything, it showed the coming of destruction. It is the so-called elites who attacked and ridiculed the top of the elite to start the Shura field of the slaughter! Even if they don't know what the reason for what they are doing, the killing has come. Here is my life. I am not sure if I really exist in my life. But I am very sure now, everyone is starting to notice me! So smile ! Why so serious?",9,0,1,12 November 2019
It Chapter Two," fear didnot mean jump scare
","The theme that 'Clowns Back to the Soul' wants to express is not new today, but regarding friendship, I really want to have good friends like loser. But how to say it, 'The Clown Returning to the Soul 2' 145 minutes of the director of the film is obviously wanting to dig more into the inner fear of the character, and the main creation adds a lot of eggs to the first part of the clown. But in fact, too many jump scares make it difficult to be scared after the mid-term, and even feel boring. The main creative desire to express more but limited to the horror film restrictions made the customer's original fear of the theme somewhat deviated, feeling the lack of the first time to see the surprise. Ps: The monsters made by modern special effects, although not scary, can really be disgusting to the audience. The emotional line of the clown's returning soul is very different from the theme! I hope the horror film can continue to be innovative, come on!",7,0,0,16 November 2019
Prometheus," life find the way
","Out of my own to who I am, where I am going, the ultimate proposition inspired us to find the Creator. We have great expectations for the unknown. But perhaps creating species is just an unintentional act. When you know the truth, you will certainly sigh the humanity's smallness and the miracle of life!",8,1,3,29 September 2019
Marriage Story," love and life
","'Marriage Story' At the age of 17, I was basically on the sidelines of marriage. The smallest conflicts and contradictions in life make me say the most vicious words to my loved ones. We have opposite words, even though it is not me Deliberately, but when the trivial life breaks through the sanity we have maintained, when the conflict between the two gradually deepens the evil words, at this time, the most terrible self usually hides behind. Life is just such a story without much modification, but often full of sadness. When Charlie finally saw Nicole's letter, they still loved each other so much. Then all words turned into tears in the corners of the eyes, but now we realize that it is too late! In the seemingly ordinary 'marriage relationship', the film injects thoughts and questions about sexual relations. It's really hard to see such a movie telling a heartbreaking divorce story in such a gentle way. Should we really think about when and why did we become hysterical? It 's not just a wonderful story. The performances of Adam Dreyfus and Scarlett have added a lot to this film. I even saw my shadow from Charlie in the future. A really good movie is so much without praise. The most real emotions are needed to let the audience in front of the screen think about themselves and their lives. This may be the greatness of the movie as the seventh art! 'I saw him in love with him within two seconds, I will never Will stop loving him, although these are not important now '",9,5,6,27 December 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," monster am i?
","When the silent lamb in your heart gives up resistance, then this will be your forever demons. The film's sense of substitution is extremely strong. The entire process of watching the movie is tight. There is also a comparison between the thin and small Judy Foster and the surrounding group of big men. There is also a parallel editing of the police. The acting skills of Judy and Anthony Hopkins also add a lot to the film. Of course, if there is such a gentle Hannibal around us, how would you feel? Right? Am I not?",9,0,0,24 November 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," redenption of DC
","Prosperous Marvel, Chaos DC! Humans are still good, we fight, fight, we betray each other, but we can start again, we can do better, we will, we must do it! 'Batman v Superman' in my heart Is one of the most underrated superhero movies. In troubled times, people need to find consolation, so he created 'Superman' and called him 'God'. Until the heyday, people began to question the 'God' that he once respected, thinking that he would threaten himself, that is, non-my This kind of backward view still exists in people's minds. Different from Marvel's DC, it will discuss the topic of sharpness and depth. Although it has not reached the artistic level, he has worked hard. I hope people can see the wider superhero universe. It is not a pile of joke and joke. It is a cold style, a deep story, and heroes in need of redemption. Look at today 's DC Justice League 's huge Waterloo causing Warner to demand a change of style, including firing Zach Schneider's director who was successful and defeated, and Henry Cavill 's Superman and Ben Affleck 's Batman fled. Some people even say DC pills! But if you ask me why I prefer DC because he always surprises me, Nolan's Batman trilogy has become the ceiling of the superhero movie, and 'The Watchman' shows us the hero Redemption, in this era of 'political correctness', 'Wonder Woman' better shows the charm of female superhero movies, and 'Neptune' has made the extreme of popcorn cool films, even ' The Joker brought the superhero movie to the podium in Venice, opened up the DC dark universe, and saw the future of Robert Pattinson's Batman coming back. This is DC, a comic company that keeps me full of expectations. I hope the heroes are immortal. If you are looking for a hero's tombstone, please look around you!",8,1,4,27 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," dram hide in cruel story
","War is so horrible to the adult world, not to mention those children in war? They may be too young to understand the fragility of life and the cruelty of war, they may be fooled by others, join this war to lose their lives, War is imagined as a test of becoming an adult, knowing that you have seen your loved ones die in this war, and you have n't really grown up until then. 'War' should not be a lie we have created for children, because it is for them. Too cruel I love my country, but I hate war. 'Jojo Rabbit' shows us the cruelty of World War II from the perspective of a child who loves 'Nazi' and Hitler enthusiastically, and wraps the core of tragedy under its comedy shell. Qiao Qiao finally realized his own growth. In this cruel war, he healed the cruel world, only love and tolerance.
