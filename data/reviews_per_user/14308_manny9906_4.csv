Blade Runner 2049," I give up...
","I've tried for years to get into the whole Blade Runner film with all the cult following it has, I've seen 3 different cuts of the original and now this one, and it's just lacking on so many levels. Visually they are great but the storyline is just slow paced and makes you feel your watching a silent movie at times. I give up.",5,4,8,11 March 2018
Justice League," A pattern is forming...
","So, I didn't love WATCHMEN until I saw the ultimate cut, didn't like BATMAN V SUPERMAN until some questions I asked while watching in the theater were answered by the extended cut. Hopefully they'll be an ultimate cut of this one that would raise my rating. Is this a pattern with Zach Snyder films or is it me??",7,4,5,22 February 2018
The Shape of Water," Del Toro's worst!
","Don't have a clue to what all the hype was about in this film, besides an outstanding performance by Michael Shannon. Cinematography and sets were great but the story was as predictable as it was unlikeable. Your not missing anything if you pass on this one on movie night. Best picture at the academy awards shows how the academy is lost to what mainstream movie goers enjoy.",6,2,6,20 July 2018
Joker," no comic book movie here!!
","Todd Phillips JOKER tale is fantastic! Well written, blend of Taxi Driver and The Killing Joke if you ask me. Joaquin Phoenix deserves an Oscar nod for his portrayal. Those of us from the Bronx will see and recognize a lot of our neighborhoods as it becomes the new Gotham. Can't say enough about how much I loved the direction Todd Phillips took in giving us a different take on the Batman/Joker storyline.",10,3,5,30 December 2019
