First Man," Movie about a man...not about technology or superiority.
","First Man is a stunning film. And, in my estimation, a misunderstood film. Controversy rose prior to its release because the planting of the American flag was not showcased in the film. I myself was putout by this omission even before having seen it. Now I have seen film. I must say that it made sense. Yes, perhaps the main underlying reason for omitting the raising of the flag might be to cater to the international market. The director is the only one who can provide that clarification and insight. But, it doesn't matter. The film is not about American Exceptionalism. It is unequivocally about one man: Neil Armstrong. From this context, it makes sense. Neil Armstrong was an extremely introspective man. The film painfully captures this. Painfully? Yes, painful in the sense that his laconic demeanor was frustrating to withstand and understand. It made it difficult to connect to the man at an emotional level. Still, his sacrifices and ordeals made one feel empathy for him. His travels into space were claustrophobic: Cramped spaces with ominous bangs and noises all around. The film did an outstanding job capturing the fear: I was frightened...and I was comfortably seated in my seat and knew he was going to be okay. Neal managed his fear in the cockpit as he dealt with his family: He was terse throughout. First Man is not about technology. It is not about patriotism. It is about a man, an exceptional man. A man that stood on the shoulders of thousands to reach the surface of the moon, and was lucky, very lucky to climb back down.",9,0,2,18 October 2018
