The New World," Poor Film
","Trailer and Poster gave the upcoming viewer high hopes... however i would no recommend this film, not only was it dragged out but ppl hardly spoke during the entire film. I was like watching paint dry. If you would cut out the boring parts you would end up with a film 20-30 minutes long. When the credits appeared, i thought what a waste of time... and what was the film all about?. a girl that falls in love with one bloke he leaves, she falls in love with another goes to england and thats it.. wow how interesting :D, Didn't have much of anything, no comedy, no action (except 10 mins), no proper story, no proper romance, nothing very disappointed.....anyhow thats my opinion.ciao ciao Steve",1,1,8,2 February 2006
