Hereditary," Art house nonsense...but still quite disturbing in a good way
","Art house films of any kind aren't my thing.. art house usually means pretentious boring and underexppained nonsense.. this is partly art house but has enough of a traditional horror story element to it to still be fairly entertaining (I.e horrifying). Overly long but still worth a watch but - and this seems weird - is actually suggest reading some spoilers about the story (which I won't put in this review) BEFORE or DURING the film to help you understand what's going on, as I think you'd enjoy it more. You could always just rewatch it but I honestly very much doubt you would bother if you don't get some of it the first time. Some excellent scenes and just enough mainstream horror to override the art house nonsense. I give it a solid 6 for that reason.",6,0,1,3 March 2019
Bird Box," The happening. So... yeah.
","This is essentially exactly the same movie as the happening. Do not understand why it needed to be made. Sandra bullock at 54 (whilst still a very attractive woman) playing a pregnant mother is more than a little ridiculous. And there is 0 explanation for what happens or why it happens. The birds see more of the action than we do. This move is essentially the happening; which wasn't very good movie to begin with.
Overly long at a bloated 2 hours. Day of the dead meets the happening. With ridiculous plot holes everywhere. Hard to empathise with the main character as she doesn't even bother to name the children. She tries to justify that but it didn't fly with me.3 stars. Netflix - try harder.",3,17,34,22 December 2018
