Requiem for a Dream," As intense as films get ...
","Now this is film making.Like others who have posted comments, I find that only a tiny minority of films have the power to affect me on an emotional level. Films like Schindler's List, Man Bites Dog, Shawshank Redemption, A Clockwork Orange, Hana-bi and even Cannibal Holocaust are some notable movies that have pressed my emotional buttons in the past and have left me thinking long after the end credits have finished. Requiem for a Dream is another to add to the list and is honestly one of the most powerful movies that I've ever seen.Does the fact that a film tugs at your emotions automatically make it good? For me personally the answer is yes, especially as I'd estimate that way less than 1% of all the movies I've ever seen were able to reach me on any sort of real emotional level (be it good or bad). However, this is far from being the only reason I rate this film so highly.Many people find Requiem's ostensibly anti-drug message rather patronising. Some posts here even associate Requiem, unfairly, with crude propaganda films like Reefer Madness. I think this demonstrates an overly simplistic view of a film that is about much more than illegal drugs and I feel it is representative, understandably, of the attitudes of people who are so sick of society's hypocritical moralising about drugs that they have just stopped listening and hence dismiss the movie too lightly. To associate RFAD with Reefer Madness seems to demonstrate precisely the same sort of unthinking intransigence that we routinely associate with anti-drug zealots. However, whilst I sympathise with those who believe Requiem is just more patronising anti-drug propaganda, they are overlooking the incredible damage that the irrational, compulsive and addictive behaviour shown in the film can cause - be it in respect of heroin, caffeine, television, chocolate, shopping, anti-depressants, use of their mobile etc. etc.  Self deception is at the heart of this issue and I think these polarised comments arise from an unwillingness on the part of the viewer to allow the necessary introspection required to get the most from this film.On the other side of the coin, I have also heard comments from people suggesting that this film has added weight to their commitment to never use drugs and that anyone who does must be a fool. This is a somewhat naÃ¯ve perspective and the same people who condemn drug use are almost certainly reliant on some `drug' of choice, be it coffee, sugar, pain-killers, anti-depressants, Jesus or whatever. I agree with these commentators that RFAD would be far more effective used in schools as a warning against the dangers of drugs than the patronising rubbish that currently passes as `drug education'. However to consider this film useful only as an anti-drug movie to scare kids into compliance is to greatly underestimate the reasons people start using these substances in the first place. After all, some people will always be attracted to drugs precisely BECAUSE of the dangers (and cachet) associated with their use.I also wish that the people who spend their time pointing out, for example, that ECT is normally used only on anaesthetised patients would save their nit-picking for the crass historical revisionism of films like Black Hawk Down or U-571 rather than pointing out inconsistencies irrelevant to the message of a film. Is Ben Hur rendered garbage because of an overlooked wristwatch? I think not.This is a movie that has something to say to EVERYBODY even if it is not on a topic explicitly covered by the on-screen mayhem. This is the sort of wake-up call we all need occasionally and watching with a smug `well, I've never used drugs' attitude is to miss the real point this film is trying to convey - that the obsessive reliance on any crutch, chemical, physical or emotional, in order to achieve the happiness we all crave is destined to end in disaster. This affects everybody on some level.RFAD is ample demonstration of Aronofsky's undoubted talent as a film maker. I greatly enjoyed the director's debut Pi and Aronofsky has taken many of the techniques that he employed in that movie to the next level here. I can understand why some may feel that the film is style over substance. Personally though, I think this is one of the most technically impressive examples of film making and editing that I have seen in a long time.The performances of the four main characters are all magnificent and Burstyn in particular is incredible. I also enjoyed seeing the underrated Keith David provides a wonderfully sleazy performance even if he is limited to only a very minor role.Special mention should also go to Clint Mansell's amazing soundtrack which adds immeasurably to the power of the film. From the sad, haunting main theme to the frenetic techno rumblings and staccato strings, the soundtrack is always a perfect accompaniment to the on screen drama. It is hardly original to ironically juxtapose a haunting and beautiful soundtrack with disturbing imagery in order to heighten the emotions of the viewer (the afore-mentioned Cannibal Holocaust being a perfect, if extreme, example of this) but here the soundtrack is employed to perfection.This is an amazing movie - intense, gripping, disturbing, provocative and gruelling to endure. Despite being so emotionally draining, this is one of the best films I have seen in the past few years and is more than deserving of it's high IMDB ranking. However, this is not for the faint hearted or those who can only enjoy a film if it makes them feel good. For anyone else this is essential viewing.I can't wait to see what Aronofsky comes up with next - let's just hope he doesn't get sucked into the system and turn into the latest Hollywood hack directing the sort of uninspiring, focus-group scripted tripe that the big studios are lamentably so good at churning out these days.",10,1,2,2 March 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," I think it would sound better in Dubly .......
","** NO SPOILERS ** Put simply, this is probably the best satire ever made and certainly one of the funniest films you will ever see, no exaggeration. Spinal Tap is also that rare commodity, a comedy that actually gets funnier the more you watch it. Spinal Tap is one of those films, like Withnail & I, that has attained absolute cult status and is undoubtedly more popular today than it ever was on it's theatrical release. As far as I can see, the only impediment to enjoying this film would be if you have no recollection of (or knowledge of if you're a younger film fan) the heady, mulleted days of 80's heavy metal.As with all spoof documentaries, the very best are those which manage to combine hilarious satire in a film which is so well made you could actually almost be convinced it was real. This is doubtless helped not only by the charismatic performances of the main trio of the band, but also by the fact that the whole film is never played for laughs - the quality of the script and the deadpan performances are what really make this so funny. This is clever stuff indeed and if there is any lesson to be learnt it's that 99% of musicians, much like film stars, are often spoilt, self-indulgent little children who really are not worthy of the adulation they receive (just in case you really needed reminding). I have deliberately not revealed much about the plot or gags because they really are best seen for yourself (also, you will find yourself repeating them ad nauseam between friends and colleagues for years to come). The performances are stunning throughout and the fact that three main stars of the group (Tufnell, St. Hubbins and Smalls) actually played and recorded the songs featured in the film adds immeasurably to the experience. The lyrics of the songs themselves are enough to have you falling out of your seat and 'killer' tracks like 'Stonehenge', 'Big Bottom', or 'Rock 'n' Roll Creation' will forever more be indelibly etched onto your brain. I really can't recommend this movie highly enough. Only those people who still think mullets, leather jackets and spandex trousers are cool should avoid this film. Everyone else - jump aboard, you won't regret it (And if you get the Special Edition DVD, you are treated to an audio commentary by the film's stars, in character, that is almost as funny as the main feature). 10 out of 10 - No doubt about it - Rob Reiner's finest hour. As a final point, if you are one of those afore-mentioned people who has no knowledge of 80's heavy metal, the film CB4 is as close as you will ever get to a hip-hop equivalent (which although entertaining is not in the same league as Spinal Tap) and may prove more approachable for younger viewers or those who really can't stand wailing guitars.",10,0,1,9 May 2002
The Matrix," Entertaining but TERRIBLE Hollywood ending (yawn)
","There's plenty of good things about this film that set it aside from your normal Hollywood action fare. However, it occurred to me half-way through the film that the whole point of the film was to try and mimic a decent Hong Kong or Japanese action/kung-fu movie and the only way to do it was to introduce flashy camera trickery. Whilst these scenes are undoubtedly impressive, any half-decent HK action flick (filmed, no doubt, for a fraction of the cost) gives you far more impressive action for your money and the skills on display are usually real.However, what really, really ruined this movie for me was the ridiculous 'resurrection' of Neo at the end when Trinity decides that she really does love him.'Oh Neo, you can't die, I lo-ove you' - Rubbish, pap, garbage.This stupid scene throws away the whole premise that the film spends so long setting up - death in the Matrix equals death in reality. But no, Neo dies and yet is resurrected, Sleeping Beauty-like, by the gentle kiss of Trinity.The film is still enjoyable, at least up until Neo's miraculous resurrection, but don't expect anything more than a predictable Hollywood film with a predictable Hollywood ending.This film is worth no more than 5 out of 10.If you really like action movies and, like me, The Matrix left a bitter , product-of-Hollyowood-focus-groups taste in your mouth, try asian cinema instead. In fact, I would strongly recommend Versus not only because it out-actions The Matrix on every level but also because of the Matrix p**s-take towards the film's climax. And Versus cost less than 1 Million bucks to make whereas I doubt a million dollars would even cover Keanu Reeves' personal masseur let alone make a dent on the Matrix's budget.Don't believe the hype - The Matrix ins't terrible and it certainly ins't fantastic, it's just very average.",Null,0,1,3 May 2002
