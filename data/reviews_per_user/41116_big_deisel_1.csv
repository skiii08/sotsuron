Mission: Impossible III," Unbelievable!
","This is the most action packed, intense movie I have ever seen!!! From beginning to end you are sitting on the edge of your seat!. You are constantly wondering and trying to figure out who is double-crossing who, or you are being blown away by the mind-boggling situations and stunts. This movie absorbs the viewers into the action and the other subplots within the film. This movie had a great plot, characters you can fall in love with, and even if you don't particularly like Tom, he does a great job in this movie. Big thumbs up to the incredible cast, everyone acted superbly in this film, which is good considering some action movies do have sketchy acting. Well done! My vote for movie of the year! Maybe movie of the decade.",10,0,1,13 May 2006
