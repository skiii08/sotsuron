The New World," What does this world do to us?
","If we take the time to look at it, really see it. The wind blows ever so, the river runs ever onward, ever the waves ride on the ocean. Snakes slither in the sea, baby turtles run up our bodies. If we let them. Does this not have the power to change us? The land is a way of life, the people just come and go. There once was a time, where people lived. They lived so. What did they talk about? What did they dream of? That time is gone, those people are gone. What they talked of is not important. The land is. It's eternal. Malick understands this. Often, his camera will break away from a conversation to look at the grass sighing in the wind. Most of his shots of people are of them walking in the grass, touching them, feeling them, feeling other people, talking by touch. People love each other, they sit together in the grass, stare at each other, smile a lot, touch each other's bodies. They hardly ever talk. Love is an exploration, of the other's body, of the other's mind. Silence is the best language to communicate. 'What else is life but being near you? Do they suspect? Oh, to be given to you; you to me.' Such passion opens up unknown vistas. Of the mind. Of the soul, if that exists. It's a New World for Pocahontas.",9,1,3,15 October 2014
