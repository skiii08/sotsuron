The King's Speech," British love in that is not as good as the hype.
","Stammering, and other speech impediments are terrible afflictions that rarely elicit sympathy. When can you last recall a movie or TV programme with a sympathetic stammerer or lisp? Bet you can recall the opposite! How about Life of Brian? 'Wewease the cwiminals' And yet our world is full of stutterers, stammerers and lispers; some of whom have overcome their problems like Bruce Willis, Tiger Woods, Julia Roberts, James Stewart; the list is endless.Nevertheless the subject has never made it to the big screen in a serious and sympathetic form, until now.The King's Speech is fundamentally a British feelgood movie about stammering. It uses King George the 6th (Actually named Albert and Father of Queen Elizabeth) as the subject and sets the story against the background of a brewing and erupting Second World War.Great Britain is facing dark days (reflected perhaps in the cinematography which is most certainly dark), King George the Fifth is on the throne but is falling into senility and his eldest son David (soon to briefly reign as King Edward the 8th) is in the midst of a scandalous affair with, gosh, An American, in the form of double divorcée Wallace Simpson. The Head of the Church of England is a role of the British monarch and that role does not allow the incumbent to marry a divorcée. But David (Edward) wants to marry Wallace more than he wants to rule Brittania. And so he abdicates leaving poor old stammering Prince Albert next in line.Albert (played to Oscar contending levels of sustained excellence by Colin Firth) has been tackling his demons for years but has had absolutely no success and is fast becoming a recluse, albeit married to our dearly beloved Queen Mother (played with a twinkle by the ever dependable Helena Bonham Carter - surely a national treasure in the mould of Dame Judie Dench in the making). He's pretty much given up hope , but Queen Mum hasn't and she finds and engages the services of a Harley St quack played to perfection by Geoffery Rush.What follows is a story about the development of a relationship and the triumph of wills married to unorthodox practices. It opens the doors to humour, pathos and a degree of tension. How could our stammering Prince become a king fit enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with Churchill as Britain takes on the Gerries? On some levels the film woks. It feels nicely in period. The acting is universally excellent (Derek Jacobi has a nice cameo as the Archbishop of Westminster) and the story is engaging enough. The ending, which I shall not spoil for you here, although it is fairly obvious is by far the highlight of the movie and very moving indeed.And yet...and yet. It drags. It feels slight. It has no real message other than, perhaps, the Royalty are humans too. My feeling is that this movie is a bit of a 'the British are coming' industry love in. It's actually not that great. A good (BBC) TV drama sure, but for all the hype it falls short.Good but missable.",7,5,12,9 January 2011
The Lobster," A real curate's egg. Good in parts.
","Extraordinary but actually, whisper it, a bit dull.Having slept through fairly long tranches of this movie I'd nevertheless call it a success.In part.Colin Farrell is quite wonderful as the central character who is consigned to a form of detention in a hotel in the depths of Ireland after his partner dumps him. With his brother in tow (a Border Collie names Bob) he has 45 days to find a new partner or face being turned into an animal of his choice which is a lobster. Why? Because they live over 100 years and are fertile throughout their lives.On arriving he faces a gentle interrogation as to his sexual preferences in which there is a slight suggestion that he may in fact be homosexual but faced with making a decision he opts for straightness. It's an odd moment that isn't actually played out in any underlying way in the movie that follows.It's a dystopia in which no-one has any names and humans are not just transformed into animals but are also hunted in a nearby forest for hotel extensions.His quest for love is challenging and results in his escaping the, presumably government run, facility to join a band of guerrilla terrorists where he finds his match in Rachel Weisz. However the terrorists ban love so a complex sign language evolves between the pair as they seek to develop a relationship. It's kind of silly but also kind of funny. It's part farce, part surrealism and has several laugh out loud moments but it's too slow, dragging endlessly in parts. Yet the juries at Cannes nominated it for their top prize. I can see why, but I can also see why it failed to scoop.The director, Yorgos Lathimos, is renowned for his satires and this is his first English language excursion and has much in common with previous outings.This is Farrell's movie from start to finish as he is rarely off screen. He demonstrates his knack for off kilter humour that had us rolling in the aisles in In Brugges, but this a very different kettle of crustaceans.Nevertheless he pulls off his task with aplomb. It really is as quite remarkable performance ably supported by John C Reilly, Ashley Jenson and Olivia Coleman.Odd? Yes.Great? Not quite.",6,5,14,30 October 2015
The Avengers," What can be said that hasn't already? This is a big, big movie that veers uncomfortably throughout froom awesome to average.
","Right. It's too long for a start. Way too long. Partly because director Joss Whedon has chosen to write 6back stories before the actual story begins. But when it does the effects are so off the scale as to mesmerise.It's funny in parts. Ruffalo as The Hulk has all the comedy gasp out loud adventure moments but Thomas Downie Junior continues to build a body of light comedy work that's slowly making him 'best in class'. Scarlett Johansonn has an admirable ass but adds little other than that. Cobie Smulders is hot. And so is Gweyneth Paltrow.The CGI and SFX as the 'Aliens' invade New York in the final reel are the best I have ever seen. By a long way. The destruction of Manhattan is actually quite scary reminding us, as it does, of 9/11.Cinematography by Seamus McGarvey, surely one of Edinburgh's great film exports (despite being an Ulsterman) is a career high of many highs.Without the back stories this would have been little short of perfection. With them it's too long so gets a seven out of ten.",7,2,7,21 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," It's good but it's a bit indulgent.
","Someone needs to get Ridley Scott in check.  His recent Alien movie was awful and overindulgent.  This is far from awful but it has his stamp all over it and at two and a half hours long is really quite indulgent.Ryan Gosling may also need to go to some acting classes because his one trick pony is wearing rather thin now.Having said that, the bad stuff, there's a lot to like about this movie.Roger Deakins is in fine form with a simply gorgeous cinematographic experience.  The yellow city and the green biodome actually take your breath away.The CGI is universally excellent.  The opening aerial sequence draws your breath and there's a love scene in which a hologram juxtaposes the body of a replicant hooker that is one of the most imaginative things I've ever seen in the cinema.Indeed this movie is RAMMED with great creative ideas.I mostly didn't mind how slow it is until perhaps the third act when, even with the excellent introduction of Harrison Ford, it began to outstay its welcome.Clearly it's a little Marmite as I've rarely seen so many of an audience leave, and its length certainly tested many a bladder.  Not mine thankfully.The plot has its challenges and I'm not going to go there as it would be too easy to spoil for you, but it's interesting and quite clever.The score by Hans Zimmer is simply brilliant.  All booming, crashing percussive synth punctuated by little moments of Vangelis (echoing the original).  He's on fire just now, what with Dunkirk under his belt.  He'll have more than one soundtrack Oscar nomination come February.I liked the way director Denis Villeneuve dwells on scenes, allowing you take in the mastery of Deakins' and the technical team's work but when he dwells lingeringly on Gosling again and again and again you do wish it would push on a bit.So, overall, a good, but not great, movie.  I wouldn't want to see it again actually given its drawn out editing.  But I liked it much more than I didn't.",7,0,2,20 October 2017
Black Swan," Wonderful. An Oscar certainty.
","Black Swan is the most visceral cinematic experience I've had since maybe Raging Bull. So, it's about ballet? So what. Ballet is merely the structure on which this tragedy about mental breakdown, maybe schizophrenia is played out.Using the metaphor of black and white (the swans) to portray, good and evil, right and wrong, strength and weakness director Darren Aranowski paints a picture of what's going on in the head of Natalie Portman as she gradually falls apart under the pressure of preparing to dance Swan Lake; with a backdrop of a doubtful choreographer, an ambitious understudy, a jealous mother and a fallen Prima ballerina; all exerting pressure of one sort or another on the poor little virgin that is Portman.Portman delivers a tour de force (Oscar certainty) performance as she wrestles with the devils in her mind and tries to prove all the doubters wrong. It's a remarkable performance in so many ways, so vulnerable (which could just have been fey) and yet so strong. Surely the Academy can look no further.But the real star of the show - notwithstanding powerhouse performances from Barbara Hershey (wonderful as the mother), Winona Ryder in a Mommie Dearest descent into her own madness, Vincent Cassel (as the unforgiving choreographer and philanderer) and Mila Kunis as the threat from the Corps de Ballet - is director Darren Aronofsky. My God, another huge contender for Academy recognition. His direction of Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler was eye opening, but this moves him onto yet another level. He is garnering a reputation for bringing mental instability to the screen in a way that is eye opening and shocking.And that's another thing about this move, it's a quite thrilling shock fest. There's a bunch of 'gotcha' moments that have you ducking for cover (quite a few shrieks were let out in our relatively small audience) as he makes the most of the ability to confuse and wrong foot his audience.And then there's the sex. I'll not go into detail here, but it is a central motif of the film (starting from the premise that Portman is a 24 year old virgin) and is certainly worthy of debate, but I don't want to spoil it for you here.All I'll say is that sitting next to my 16 year old daughter as it played out made for a degree of discomfort! All in all this is a truly outstanding piece of film-making. In Darren Oronofsky we have one of America's next great directors really cementing his claims for greatness and Natalie Portman never has, and never will, have a part this great again.Go see.Do NOT wait for the DVD, it will not be the same.",10,2,5,23 January 2011
Captain Phillips," A missed opportunity but two great performances.
","Paul Greengrass has nearly made a very good movie. Tom Hanks puts in a lifetime best performance as the captain of a ship subjected to a fairly inept Somalian Pirate hijack. The concluding scene is arguably worth the ticket price alone but we have a rather unevenly judged journey to traverse before we get there.The opening scenes as the captain leaves his wife for a month at sea are unconvincing and not really very believably scripted but the film quickly settles into itself on board the Maersk container ship that Phillips has to steer Southwards along the Somalian Coast and around the Crook of Africa.We are then, in cinema verite style, (ie shaky camera) introduced to a band of Somalian mercenary pirates, brilliantly cast by Francine Maisler. The chief protagonist in this motley crew is Muse played by the raggedy and waif-like Barkhad Abdi. Throughout he engages us with his his mix of vulnerability and venom. It's another great performance.Inevitably the pirates board the ship (well obviously - so hardly a spoiler) but both the build up and the time on board are strangely unexciting. (Dare I say it, almost a tad dull?)Without spoiling the plot the movie moves significantly through the gear box in the second half as things get a lot more claustrophobic and significantly more epic. It nearly excites.But it doesn't really.This movie feels like a missed opportunity. Despite Hanks and Abdi it's not a gripper and it needs to be. It has no real political insight or judgement. The 'baddies' are, aside from Abdi, caricatures; at times resonant of the Islamic terrorists portrayed so hilariously in Four Lions. American imperialism is celebrated rather than challenged. It has its moments (not least the magnificent closing scene) but overall it's no more than a 6/10.",6,3,5,6 November 2013
Skyfall," Yes. Best Bond of them all. In so many ways.
","To begin with I must state that I am NOT a Bond fan. But I have an open mind and of all the Bond movies I've seen in my time (many) I have to say that I thought Daniel Craig's Casino Royale was probably my favourite. I chose not to see Quantum of Solace; a movie with a name as ridiculous as that had to be hiding something and it seems my gut feel was right given its poor reviews. But Skyfall seemed different. Certainly the advance reviews have been excellent and so I turned up on opening weekend willing to e impressed.I was.This is, by some margin, the finest Bond film I've ever seen. Although it has its faults (it's a little too long) it scores points in nearly every department; the acting is universally excellent, The plot and script suitably overblown but flecked with humour and humanity throughout. Outrageous chases and set pieces (the rooftop motorbike chase just about winning price for most audacious chase scene I've ever seen).But it's what lies at the soul of this film (and it really does have a soul) is the cast. In particular we see the cloth lifted on what motivates Bond, his back story and in particular his upbringing. It's this that starts to flesh out his (and more unexpectedly Javier Bardem's) relationship with M who although as feisty as ever actually develops into quite a sympathetic and interesting subplot.The film is excellently directed (by Sam Mendes!) with a theme (yes a Bond movie with a 'theme') about age and the battle between tradition and modernity running through it like a stick of rock (occasionally clunkily so). This allows the production team to have great fun with old Bond gadgetry (and music) alongside the very latest in technology - an obfuscated living data network being at its centrepiece which allows a new and ridiculously young looking (he's actually 32) Q to be introduced in the shape of Ben Wishaw (Perfume).But its Daniel Craig's complete mastery of Bond as a character that is setting the movie industry into overdrive and not surprisingly. In the movie, in tune with the theme of age and ageing, he's almost not fit for purpose having 'taken one for the team' possibly once too often. He's on the verge of breakdown at the movie's outset and takes the requisite, and to be expected, barrage of beatings as it unfolds, emerging at its denouement just about in one piece and ready for action with whatever lies in store in the next instalment. It's an interesting dimension and works well with Judi Dench's excellent central performance as M.Craig is the complete Bond. Rugged, handsome, athletic, suave but with more steel than any since Connory and, to my mind, he's a better actor than Mishter Cool himself.As the face of not one but two major film franchises (The Girl with...) he's solid gold and, for my money, worth every penny of it.I also like Adele's theme music.",8,2,8,29 October 2012
It," Proper scary. Proper quality . Stephen King at his very, very best.
","Right.  This is 'Stranger Things: The Nightmare'.Which means it's; 'ET, The Goonies, Stand by Me: The Nightmare.'Not least because it stars Finn Wolfhard.And, if nothing else it has unearthed the preternaturally beautiful Sophia Lillis, as Beverley, who, like Wolfhard, surely has a massive career ahead of her.It is proper scary.Kids fight monsters.  What's not to like?Nothing beats proper scary in my book and few writers create scariness better than Stephen King.  The Shining and Carrie are two of the best horror films ever made and this is his hat-trick.We open in year 27 (1989 with lots of neat historical references) of a 27 year cycle in which mayhem descends on the small town of Derry (in Maine?) and follows a group of Losers; geeks, fatties, stutterers, black kids, scaredycats and a tomboy with attitude (Beverley) who also provides the love interest.The movie starts with stutterer Bill (beautifully played by Jaeden Leiberher) losing his beloved younger brother, Georgie, to a demonic clown who lives in the town's sewers.  It's the start of a series of disappearances amongst children in the town.  And the clown, played superbly by Bill Skarskgard, called Pennywise is out to wreak havoc having been let loose in year 27.The movie has plenty of jumps.  And some of the appearances of Pennywise are frankly terrifying.Despite its length, over two hours, it maintains interest throughout and the story develops brilliantly.  Top marks to director Andy Muschietti who is adept at creating mood, atmosphere and moments of humour.'Who invited Molly Ringwold' asks Wolfhard in reference to the short red haired Beverley.  It's a laugh out loud moment (and Wolfhard has them all).There's a neat subplot about school bullying (that begins a little clichéd but develops nicely) with a good performance from Nicholas Hamilton as a proper bully, Henry Bowers.But the heart of the movie is dedicated to scaring the 'you know what' out of you.And it succeeds triumphantly.It's a great horror movie.  It really is.",9,7,18,8 September 2017
Detroit," Kathryn Bigelow is on a roll. Three classics in a row. This may be the best.
","It's fair to say that Kathryn Bigelow is on a roll.Her last three movies (Hurt Locker, Zero Dark Thirty and now Detroit) have been gut busting horror shows about the human condition.I love that Kathryn Bigelow sits in the 'male' directors' chair. I love hat she must be and should be a feminist icon, because she does the sort of movies that she makes much better than most men make them.Kathryn Bigelow likes an explosion, a gun, a death. But her female perspective on this raises it from guts and gory/glory into something higher. Something more profound.Zero Dark Thirty and The Hurt Locker both took on war as the subject matter. This does too, but it's the war of the races. The war of oppression by white men upon black in the Summer of Love.Ironic, because this is a film about hate. Racism. Supremacy.It opens with a short animation that perfectly encapsulates America's fundamental tic. The thing that won't go away. The displacement of race. From the displacement of American Indians to the displacement of Africans to the slave plantations of the Deep South and latterly their displacement into the Northern industrial cities like Detroit.This displacement, in fact, displaces the white ruling class into the suburbs and that's the start of deep tension and resentment.We have witnessed this in the UK too, as gentrification of once unfashionable districts has displaced both black and white working classes into modern day ghettos. And it ain't stopping any day soon.What Bigelow achieves with this movie is a political calling cry to any liberal minded decent human being, regardless of colour or creed. It vilifies the atrocious white police force of late sixties Detroit (Yet, I don't think Detroit itself was much different from other places – there were riots in Harlem for instance and we all know about 1980's LA).She creates an almost documentary feel that is more 4D than any of the 4D Sh!t you'll see in multiplexes. Because this is for real.Apart from the relatively well known John Botega (brilliant thank you) her massive ensemble cast is star-free. That's kinda how she rolls.But each and every one of the 20 or so leads (yes 20) will have had life-affirming, and early career defining, roles in this epic.But one stands out above all else in this majestic movie.Will Poulter.The actual devil incarnate.Were he real, not an actor, he should rot in hell. But he's only an actor and his performance is surely Oscar worthy. You simply despise this evil racist bastard. And he is unflinching in his evilness. The smirk at the end of the movie almost gets you out of your seat.This is a truly great movie. A movie that should be syllabus material on any High School history course.Kathryn Bigelow and her team (especially writer Mark Boal) deserve all the awards that this movie will hopefully receive.",9,6,19,22 September 2017
A Star Is Born," A profoundly moving and beautiful love story.
","That Lady Gaga can come out of the blocks like this, on her movie acting debut, is nothing short of remarkable. She gives the currently almost peerless Bradley Cooper (four Oscar nominations, soon to be six I'd suggest) a close run in who is the stand out talent in this epic and beautiful movie (encompassing, as it does, both Coachela and Glastonbury on its flightpath).This is a great movie, a classic Hollywood blockbuster with no pretentious of arthouse glory, just great storytelling, great acting, great directing (Cooper), great cinematography and great music (cooper again, and Gaga).Frankly, what is there not to love in that list?I won't bore you with the plot, we all know it, but the thing that counts in this is the relationship between the two leads - virtually no-one else really matters other than to propel the storyline along. This is ALL about Gaga and Cooper who are electrifying from the second they meet.If they are not both Oscar nominated I will be astounded because this is an uncanny love affair between two actors that seem, in love.Gaga's willingness to loudly declare her physical kinks, specifically her considerable nose only makes her more believable, more loveable and, in fact, more beautiful. Few would call Gaga a poster girl, her looks are unorthodox in the beauty stakes, but the endless intense close ups of her warts and all features make her tremendously endearing.Bradley Cooper, by contrast, is as handsome as it is possible to imagine with his piercing blue eyes, interesting new facial hair and a torso to kill for.He directs this simple story with simplicity. At all times less is more and he manages, brilliantly, in the second act, to downplay Gaga's fame with superbly unloveable material. The fact is, her success is gained by bypassing her natural talent and fabricating a stage persona that is so underwhelming as to make you gasp (well done Rafi Gavin on odiously achieving that feat on her behalf).Cooper's jealousy is never melodramatic and his portrayal of drug and drink induced stupor is profoundly believable. I was constantly on the edge of tears during this movie, because it's achingly endearing and a true work of art.100% and unreservedly recommended.",10,2,4,9 October 2018
Gravity," Time to sense check this decent but over-hyped movie folks.
","Oh come on! This is a decent enough movie, I'll give you that, but the outpouring of reverence over it is excessive.It's a chase movie in space.In fact it's Captain Philips in space (that too is somewhat over-rated).I'm not going to go into great detail here because it would be too easy to spoil it for those of you who have yet to make up your own mind.I saw it (on strong recommendation) on an iMAX screen. (My first (and possibly last) such commercial exploitation.) Sure, iMAX is bigger, and LOUDER. But is it better? Nope.Anyway, back to Gravity.Sandra Bullock puts in a very good shift, but Oscar worthy? Surely someone in the movie PR world is having a laugh about that.Buzz Lightyear provides solid support.The star of the show though are the special effects. It is brilliantly realised. Stunningly. Almost unimaginably so.But that doesn't make it engaging.It is exciting from time to time. But in between the exciting bits (whisper this) it's a little bit boring.Just a little bit. But. It. Is. A. Little. Bit. Boring.But hey, go see it, make your own mind up. What do I know? I'm in the minority on this one and people who's creative judgement I trust implicitly have raved about it.But me and my better half just thought it was good (but a little bit boring).(Just a little bit.)",7,0,1,17 November 2013
Darkest Hour," Dullest Hour
","Dullest Hour more like.It was all I could do to stay awake in this admittedly luscious, extremely well acted production.But usually the Ring Cycle is also both of those things. It doesn't mean it's enjoyable though.Honestly, it goes on and on and on with little or no light and shade (other than in the sumptuous lighting of almost every shot - Joe Wright sure can create a filmic canvas, but once you've seen 100 Caravaggios you've seen a thousand, and there's a thousand on show here.)Now, let's consider Oldman's performance. It's highly celebrated and he is hot favourite for all the acting gongs this season. But it's an impersonation (and one that's been done well on more than one occasion before). Compared to Daniel Kaluuya in Get Out it is far less engaging in my opinion. His fear and horror is palpable. Oldman does capture more than a cliched portrait of Churchill and shows sensitivity and wit, but he's encumbered by too much screen time, monotonous styling and a sense of 'wait for it, the big quote is heading this way in 30 seconds,' time and again.King George and Viscount Halifax both have to deal with speech defects that may well be historically accurate, but do nothing for either of their gravitas.In a massively male movie (which is fair enough) Lily James as Churchill's secretary adds light relief, but Kristen Scott Thomas throws shards of light. If only she had more screen time.Christopher Nolan's magnificent Dunkirk makes a far more interesting exposition of the happenings in the French port in May/June 1940. By contrast, this is just rather self indulgent, with little in the way of either entertainment or historical insight.",5,4,7,28 January 2018
Inglourious Basterds," Amongst Tarantino's finest
",There's not a lot more to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. But a few observations I would make are... 1. Tarantino has no end to his imagination 2. Aside from the Producers it is possible to pastiche the Third Reich without falling foul of the PC police3.Christopher Weiss is awesome4. Two scenes in this movie; the opening 20 minutes and in the German bar are at the top of Tarantino's game 5.Brad Pitt can act. It's a gem 8/10,8,1,11,31 August 2010
Passengers," A decent mix of romance, thrills and Sci-fi with Stanley Kubrick thrown in.
","5,000 passengers and 258 staff, including Jennifer Lawrence, as writer Aurora Lane, and Chris Pratt, as mechanic Jim Preston, are on a 120 year journey on the commercial spaceship, Starship Avalon, to a distant earthlike colony called Homeland.A meteor storm causes havoc though when it leads to mechanical damage and the unlocking of Preston's cryogenic pod. Instead of a four month luxury approach to Homeland that's now extended to 80 years with no way of getting back into his pod. For over a year, with only an Android barman, played by Michael Sheen (in a brilliant nod to Kubrik's Overlook Hotel bar in The Shining) for company, what follows is a study in mental health, romance and danger.Dubbed Titanic in Space it's easy to see why.It's a yarn with quite a nice romantic tale in reel two between Lawrence and Pratt that's entirely well judged.The third reel, when it all (inevitably) goes a bit Pete Tong, has echoes of Gravity but overall, to my taste, this is a far more engaging film throughout.Some of the sic-fi is a bit bonkers. There's a great set piece in a swimming pool (the ultimate infinity pool) that has riled techno-geeks but, for me, it was clever and quite thrilling.Months from now this movie will be receding into my memory quite significantly, but as a 'don't take it too seriously romance/action movie' it hits all the buttons.Decent escapism.",7,6,15,23 December 2016
Argo," A truly outstanding contribution to cinema by Ben Affleck.
","Before today I honestly can't think of anything I would have had to say about Ben Affleck, good or particularly bad. He's one of those Hollywood A-Listers that just doesn't feature on my radar. Dunno why, he's been (starred) in enough half decent movies to make an impression. And a lot of turkeys. A journeyman pro I guess would be my description.Not any more.Because Ben Affleck can direct. Boy can he direct.Argo is tight as a drum from start to finish, features one of the most suspenseful scenes ( more of a reel than a scene) that I've ever seen and he commands the screen as the movie's star i such a low key way that he's almost not there. And yet he is. Resoundingly.Argo is almost immaculately conceived, scripted, edited, sound-tracked and acted. There are laugh out loud moments and moments of such supreme tension you just can't bear to watch. The resolution is extraordinarily moving for two reasons. It's majestically underplayed and the music is perfectly pitched.The ensemble cast of six hostages, Affleck, John Goodman (back on form with some right good lines), Brian Cranston (making a bid to be America's oldest acting superstar), Alan Arkin (really? really is that Alan Arkin?) and a bunch of smaller parts play their parts universally well.But this is all about Ben Affleck at the end of the day. His third director's role proper his nabbed a Golden Globe nomination for best Movie, director supporting actor (Arkin), and screenplay; of these surely Director is within range and maybe best movie.Anyway, my advise is, go see it and make your own mind up because IMHO this is an outstanding movie only equalled by The Master and End of Watch in 2012 (that I've seen).Everything that The Master lacks in plot terms Argo delivers in spades. Argo doesn't have the impact of a Seymour Hoffman or Joaquin Pheonix performance but it is none the worse for it.9/10",9,0,0,29 December 2012
Us," Thought provoking. Peele is emerging as a master craftsman
","The Us of the title are Jordan Peele's 'tethered' doppelgÃ¤ngers of North Americans who live underground. After many years underground the Rapture has arrived as predicted in Jeremiah 11:11 and the human race faces a challenge that it will struggle to overcome.Peele's second horror is every bit as intellectually challenging as Get Out And like that debut features a fine central performance; this time in the form of Lupita Nyong'o, her family and their 'tethers'. For quite long sequences of the movie Nyong'o shares the screen with herself in absolutely seamless editing and post production that takes your breath away. In fact much of this film does that with its incredible design and vivid photography.The main cast is almost exclusively black, but a fine cameo by Elizabeth Moss and her family is the exception.A starting point may have been Michael Jackson's Thriller.Nyong'o, as a young child in 1986, is drawn into this sinister underworld in a beach-side fairground show on Santa Cruz promenade. Wearing the Thriller T shirt her dad has won in a coconut shy she is taken from this world to a backdrop of Hands Across America, which was supported by Jackson.It's not the scariest horror you will ever see (although it has enough jumps to keep your heart going) but it's one of the creepiest. It sits neatly in the latest greats of the genre (Get Out, It follows) that treats its viewer with respect and keeps you guessing right to the end.I won't say much more as it will only lead me to spoilers but, put it this way, we are in the hands of a master craftsman here - his next movie project is a rewrite of Candyman by the way.",8,2,5,3 April 2019
Ted," the great 10 out of ten 2 out of ten roller-coaster ride.
","I'm not going to dwell on this .Ted is so funny you actually have to look behind you to check if anyone else in the cinema is actually phoning the police to report you for having thoughts that are a) illegal b) illegal c) socially unacceptable d) sick e) illegal f) perverse.The good news though is that between the bits where it is so funny that you should actually hand yourself in for treatment/counselling it's really rather dull.So as the film progresses you're like 'this is a ten man' to 'this is a two man' (ah, only if you are sad as me that I think in IMDb mode at every movie I ever see.So it's like 10, 2, 10, 2, 2, 2, 9, 5, 10, 2, 2, 2, 10, 9, 2, 2, all the way through and the average of that is about 6 so I'll give it a 7.It's really funny (but boring).",7,1,5,22 September 2012
The Irishman," Another Scorsese masterpiece as Pesci, Pacino and, especially, De Niro shine.
","Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The King Of Comedy, Goodfellas, Casino, Cape Fear, The Departed, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence and now The Irishman. Most Directors would give a limb to have made just one of these magisterial films. That list numbers 12. And then there's a bunch more of note sitting just below these.The cinema industry is up in arms at Netflix pinching surely one of Scorsese's last great outings from under their noses.£200m was pumped into this movie that's been sitting around, unmade for a decade.It tempted Joe Pesci out of his retirement and put Pacino, Pesci and De Niro under Scorsese's gaze for the first time.And what a gaze.In a 210 minute film that gives about 5 to women this is a man's, man's, man's outing to outman all of its lofty predecessors, but there were many women in the audience of the big screen showing I attended and they loved it.Anna Pacquin, De Niro's daughter, is the only female character of note in the movie (the wives are fairly incidental). Her single scripted word screams volumes from the screen and makes her appearance meritorious despite its paucity.Pacino and Pesci are wonderful, but it's a De Niro movie. Scorsese's real muse this bookend's both of their careers starting with Taxi Driver and surely ending here. It's a massive performance full of grit, humour and pathos. It's simply breathtaking. Especially when you consider the mid - late career crud that De Niro has been serving us. Note this, Phoenix has competition for the Oscar that we all thought was surely a shoo-in only a month or two ago.The humour is unexpected and one scene, in particular, where an absurd conversation about a fish takes place in a car, reminds us of the Chicken Royale scene in Pulp Fiction. Clearly Scorsese has been noting the competition and, here, matches or possibly even exceeds them.This demands to be seen on the big screen. The monumental running time sits better with a cinema screening where you can tackle it in its full immensity without trips to the teapot (or wine cellar - it's a two bottler). What it allows Scorsese is the time to tell a complex tale languidly. It gives him room to explore male relationships, bonding and latterly reflection on a life that has much shame.That Scorsese takes maybe 30 minutes to conclude a movie that in other hands would last five is telling. But it's exactly this that lies at the heart of an epic that sadly many will just say is boring.It's anything but.Much has been made of the 'de-aging' technology, mostly critically, but it really helps to tell a four decade story using the same actors throughout. OK it made De Niro a little rosy cheeked at times, but it gets away with it. And the ageing of Pesci, in particular, is amazing. His final scenes of a man in very old age are moving and gripping.,I was blown away.",10,3,12,17 November 2019
Spotlight," An important movie treated with great respect and compelling from start to finish.
","'I'm just a poor boy from a poor family' says one of the victims of systematically covered up child abuse by paedophile Priests in Boston 'and when a priest pays attention to you, it's a big deal. How do you say 'no' to God?' The victim might well have added, as I did, subconsciously, the paraphrased words of Freddie Mercury 'spare me my life from this monstrosity.'Because let's make no mistake here. This was a monstrosity.The story is, on the surface, a journalistic procedural about the 'exposing' (no pun intended) of paedophile priests in Massachusetts (Boston specifically) by The Boston Globe's 'Spotlight' tiny hit squad at the turn of the millennium. The investigation is set into motion at the instruction of the ailing paper's then Editor, Marty Baron, played with callous inscrutability by Liev Scriver. It's a masterful performance.Or at least that's how the movie's billed. In actual fact it becomes a complete deconstruction of the 'Three Estates' and commentary on their deep rooted self protection; the clergy, the news industry, the legal sector, the monied are all systematically pulverised in Josh Singer and Tom McCarthy's acid script.No one comes out alive.Including, tragically, many of the thousand and more victims of this institutionalised psychological 'phenomenon' that is peculiar to a significant minority (6% apparently) of the Catholic clergy, not just in Boston Massachusetts, but the first world over.That's why this film is so important, because as we bemoan the effect of Islamic fundamentalism of the World order right now the Christian religion has been breeding just as insidious an evil, but from within and of its own, for decades (maybe, no probably, longer. As the movie opens it quickly becomes apparent that Spotlight is a commercial indulgence in the context of falling newsprint sales and the fledgling 'internet' bringing with it, as it did, almost unlimited free 24 hour news. The new editor, with a reputation for cutting the workforce elsewhere, initially looks at Spotlight (a team of four) with scepticism.They grow their stories at leisure and have an unhealthily parochial attitude towards them. They look set for the chop until Baron learns of a priest who's been exposed and thinks it's a story for the Spotlight team. Apart from eager beaver, Mike Rezendez (another magnificent performance by the chameleon-like Mark Ruffalo) they're initially reluctant because they know the city 'mafia' (it's strongly Catholic and protects its own) will not make the task easy and could, in fact, boycott the title if the accusations are distasteful.The Spotlight team go for it with vigour. The meat of the film gradually excavates the layers of deceit,and cover up executed by the Archbishop, his cronies and the legal profession who carry out extensive, but not particularly elaborate burial of evidence, misfiling of case reports and the turning of blind eyes right left and centre.The police are implicated (no, accused) the most senior judiciary (some of them also Catholic) subvert and seal important files.Frankly, the whole thing sucks.And then 9/11 strikes, suddenly the world's eyes turn to Islam, including Spotlights'. How ironic.It's a tragic intervention in many ways because the team is making real progress; extracting victim stories from grown men, mainly but not exclusively, that agree to tell their stories and closing ion on the legal, clergy and city movers and shakers that are at the heart of the cover up.But eventually the case resumes and we reach our inevitable and well publicised finale.What Tom McCathy has achieved here is turn a movie into a fly on the wall docudrama, shot , as it is, in unglamourous fluorescent light for the most part. The lead performances by Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, Michael Keaton and John Slattery are selfless. Spotlight is bigger than any of them. ( A special mention must also go to Stanley Tucci for playing the lawyer with a heart in an award worthy turn.)The script is a whodunit of epic proportions and the content is both worthwhile and necessary and the sum is most certainly greater than the parts.Praise to the real Spotlight team was ultimately massive (they won the Pulitzer prize for their efforts) but the impact it has had as it has resonated across not just the Boston Globe but its entirety makes this an effort of monumental proportions and the basis of a truly great movie that should win best picture at the 2016 Academy Awards.",10,5,9,31 January 2016
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tinker Tailor Soldier siiiiiigh.
","Even though I did not gawp as Sir Alec Guinness enthralled the great British middle classes in the late 1970's in the famous BBC adaptation of John Le Carre's celebrated novel, and indeed not having read the book, I nevertheless approached this much trumpeted British 'classic' with enthusiasm.My anticipation was grossly misplaced. It is a tedious and turgid celebration of Britain's Cold War spying fraternity that is so badly plotted that to the uninitiated it has the transparency of a potato.If anyone can tell me what the hell was going on in this self indulgent nonsense I'd be grateful. On second thoughts, don't bother, I don't really care.We Brits do get so chipper about our occasional foray into big news cinema and so the arrival of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy has been trumpeted loudly and uncritically in the British (mainly broadsheet) press.The King's Speech too was credited with far greater quality than it actually delivered.This is just a mess.There is little to fault about the acting from a fine ensemble of British character actors who all carry out their duties perfectly well, generally in a half light that occasionally works cinematographically and sometimes just makes the action plain gloomy.The art department excels however with excellent period details from start to finish.Director Tomas Alfredson's first movie, Let The Right One in, is as tight as a drum and is beautifully realised - in stark contrast to this nonsense.I can't honestly remember the last time I was quite so bored in a cinema and I blame, principally, the screenplay for this because it assumes its audience knows the detailed storyline and makes no effort to introduce novices to the basic premises of what the story is actually about.How a film with so many twists and turns, flahbacks (way too many) and references can be boring beats me. But it is.Unless you know the book or the TV series well, avoid like the plague.",Null,1,8,25 September 2011
The Hateful Eight," Brilliant Tarantino as he parodies himself. Ignore the critics.
","In which Quentin Tarantino sticks two fingers up to the American film industry and thinks to himself; if there's nothing else left to parody it's time to parody myself.Tarantino's films have increasingly taken themselves less and less seriously. Look back through his seven previous movies and you'll see that he started with a pretty full on, totally original, but relatively serious 'take' on Mean Street type hit men, mafia stooges and mobsters with his only real moment of pure humour being the Stealer's Wheel 'ear scene' in Reservoir Dogs..Pulp Fiction was a full blown paean to, um, pulp fiction and rather than reaching for the humour button instead drew entirely on style.Jackie Brown was a stunning tribute to blaxploitation and pulp fiction of a more cerebral kind, drawing as it did on Elmore Leonard's superior crime noir and was an instant classic.But Kill Bill 1 & 2 started to see Tarantino play games with his audience. This time he sought out humour as he dialled up the violence to ridiculous, but glorious, proportions drawing from Manga, Kung Fu, Bruce Lee, and Monkey to delight all who sailed with him. Death Proof I'll have to comment on only from reviews I've read. It pastiched B movies and Grindhouse. His descent into levity was beginning in earnest.Inglorious Basterds (war films) continued that journey and it reached new highs with the remarkable performance of Christoph Waltz in Django Unchained; this time Westerns being the genre of choice.It's perhaps a surprise to see him tackle the same genre two movies running as Westerns are the source of The Hateful Eight's inspiration but, for me, it's actually Tarantino that is the inspiration, because he's made a conscious decision to rip the p*** out of himself in this wondrous three hour epic. Every excess that Tarantino has brought to our screens in the past is amplified in this shoot 'em up, completely joyous and utterly unpretentious homage to Quentin Tarantino.He lampoons himself by appearing as a voice over, very briefly, on two occasions, thereby giving us his 'Hitchcock Moment' - another nod of reverence to a master of the big screen. But it's the killings (and there are many) that provide the greatest glee and give Tarantino the most fun. Buckets of blood mixed with suet and bits of bone spray liberally across the set, and regularly onto the magnificent countenance of Jennifer Jason Lee (an actress that's clearly up for the ride and vies with Samuel L. Jackson for star billing).Cowboys vomit gallons of gore in brilliant fountains of rouge and heads are dramatically obliterated with barely a by your leave.Even his cast is a parody of itself. Michael Madsen is back for the first time since being Mr Blonde, as is Tim Roth who was Mr Orange; Kurt Russell follows up his Death Proof appearance, Samuel L. steps out for the sixth time, Bruce Dern does a quick reappearance after Django, as does Walter Goggins who is terrific as the Sheriff.It's glorious (inglorious really). A pure romp. A very clever storyline, beautifully filmed, hilariously, and I mean laugh out loud hilariously, scripted and the ensemble cast is a pure delight.From the very first bar of Ennio Morricone's masterful score (in itself another parody) to the last note of the closing credits this is filmmaking at its most uninhibited, most irreverent (the n word appears many more times than any other white man could get away with) and most crafted.A triumph.I cannot wait for his forthcoming horror movie.",9,4,13,24 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," A rags to rags story of your ordinary American trailer trash skating icon.
","Alongside some of its more highbrow Oscar contenders I expected I, Tonya to be a little lightweight and, whisper it, maybe one that's really more for the ladies than the gents. Not so. This movie has balls.It tells the true life story. (Wait a minute, who says it's true? Ed. Ah, good point Ed. the opening is heavily disclaimered regarding the truth and whose story is correct.)It tells a multi-faceted rendering of the happenings that surrounded Tonya Harding's rise from poor American trailer trash to, well, just managing American trailer trash, with a tilt at winning the Olympic figure skating Gold medal, as favourite, along the way.It's a rags to rags story in which poor Tonya has to suffer more than probably any global superstar ever before to make her claim for fame; ending instead in infamy.Margot Robbie not only stars as the eponymous lead but produced the film and, in similar fashion to Charlize Theron in Monster, ditches her stunning good looks for hair, make up and wardrobe (train tracks and all) that makes her, frankly, a mess.Her back story, brilliantly and hilariously told in pretty short order, deals with a life (allegedly) mired in terrible abuse; firstly from her disgusting 'Skating Mom' played brilliantly (and a cert for an Oscar) by Alison Janney (West Wing) and her equally disgusting young husband (Sebastian Stan). The opening scene, as a three year old skating prodigy being brought to her first skate class, is hysterical and sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Somehow, despite this tram-smash of a life, Harding rises above it all and bulldozes her way through the middle-class American skating hierarchy into prime position thanks not only to her generally brilliant ability but, in particular, to her nailing the Triple Axel.That's when it all goes wrong.You'll know why, so I won't bore you with the details. But suffice it to say the hapless events that follow are particularly well enacted by her 'security' Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser); reminding me of Four Lions.Suffice it to say this movie is great. The acting is universally superb. The skating scenes are entirely convincing, the humour (black as the ace of spades) is laugh out loud time and again, and the way that Harding is dealt her cards, and the beatings she takes both physical and mental, are abhorrent and repulsive.Robbie is a revelation in the role and has joined the Hollywood A list as a consequence. I can't wait to see her in Mary Queen of Scots (alongside, count them, no fewer than eight other announced roles) and whilst she won't beat Frances McDormand to the coveted Best Female Lead in March this performance has set a new bar for which she can only progress beyond.Bravo. If I had a red rose I'd throw it on the ice right now.(The soundtrack, all the best worst American MOR ever, is great too.)",9,4,6,27 February 2018
Molly's Game," One to save for watching on TV.
","It's always a treat when Aaron Sorkin brings a new script to our screens, large or small, and his output (aside from West Wing) has been quite thinly spread over recent years. For me, the high point was The Social Network, but Steve Jobs was pretty damn fine too.And it's an unusual move for writers to become directors (albeit Martin McDonagh has done so to remarkable effect). This is Sorkin's directorial bow and he makes a pretty decent fist of it.It's a good, but not great, film that moves along at typical, for Sorkin, high pace, almost matching that of Tom Lehrer's, The Elements. And that is both its strength and its weakness. It's kind of exhausting keeping up with 140 minutes of non stop verbal action.The story concerns the real life of Molly Bloom; Olympic skier turned (illegal) poker madame. My first gripe is the huge dependence on narration from the central character (played superbly by Jessica Chastain). It's a tiresome devise that too often intrudes. It doesn't kill the movie but, for me, it hampers it.The second is that it's just too one-paced. It lacks light and shade.But it's also absorbing, interesting and full of surprises.Chastain puts in an an Oscar nominatable performance (but it's in no way winnable, given what Frances McDormand has put down in Three Billboards as a marker).Idris Elba had the ladies in my company quite hot and bothered and puts in a decent shift as Chastain's legal representative. He's needed because her early cleaner than clean rules of engagement gradually become blurred and loose.It's a great yarn and it holds the audience throughout. But will I remember it a year from now? Not particularly.",6,1,3,19 January 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Excellent period piece that tackles a tricky subject head on.
","Kaboooooooom!That's the sound of Spike Lee returning with a bang.Lee's work has been lean pickings for me since his heyday in the late 80's and early 90's with movies like Do the Right Thing and She's Gotta Have It.But the rest of his cannon (maybe through ignorance on my part) has failed to engage me.But this almost nails it.My one overall criticism is that, at times, I'm not sure if Lee wants to make a comedy or a searingly monstrous docu-drama.For me the hate he brings to the screen out punches the comedy 10:1.Two characters in the movie should have been booted into touch: both are lampoons and detract from what is otherwise a great whole. These are the hate-filled racist local cop (Officer Clay Mulaney) and the KKK sidekick Ivanhoe (Paul Walter Hauser - hilarious in a similar slapstick role in I Tonya, but misplaced here).They are minor distractions but become grit in your eye, detracting from the overall menace and subtle humour surrounding a subject that is far from humorous.What Lee does with this is face up, full on, to the endemic prejudice that fuels the police force and the local white population in small town Colorado.He creates a sense of time and place that is authentic and cool man. As you would expect from a Spike Lee Joint the black cast are dealt most of the best hands, but Adam Driver (as a Jewish cop - only one step removed from being black in this chapter of the KKK's eyes) performs an excellent supporting role as the white man who infiltrates the KKK on behalf of his black colleague (John David Washington).You'll know the plot constuct by now so I won't bore you with that.What makes it a great movie is the sense of time, place and politics, the soundtrack and the unflinching ability of Lee to capture the racist poison that is encapsulated in the performance of Jasper Pääkkönen as Felix Kendrikson; by far the most committed and cynical of the Klansmen. And yet it is underpinned by nice comedic moments (other than the slapstick I described earlier).There's a scene in which the Chapter watch a screening of Birth of a Nation where, although underpinned by some humour, that hatred really does come across compellingly. It's chilling.It's a great (true) story that is extremely well told.At times the cinematography is truly outstanding - in particular the scene in which a visiting black political speaker (Kwame Toure, played by Corey Hawkins) addresses the local black student population. Lee creates a montage of faces from the crowd that echoes Queen's seminal Bohemian Rhapsody video but so stylistically and handsomely that it's art on screen for just a few fleeting moments.It's seared on my mind.Recommended.",8,4,9,24 January 2019
The Way Back," A sadly missed opportunity from an old master. Not his best
","The premise of this 'based on a true story' movie is quite staggering. A group of seven men break free from a Russian forced labour camp in the Northern Gulags of Siberia. They then cross a wintry Siberia, the Gobi Desert, the Himalayas and finally the Indian subcontinent. All by foot, all in farcically difficult conditions and running the risk of being handed in for a bounty on their heads.Add to that the fact that it is directed by the once awesome Peter Weir (The Truman Show, Witness, Picnic at Hanging Rock) and mix in a pretty star studded cast (Colin Farrell and Ed Harris) all shot on location and what one would expect is a moving, jaw dropping boy's own adventure that takes the breath away.Instead we get a very disappointing anticlimax with some hammy, nay cod, Polish acting (Farrell triumphs in this department), poorly lit and rather uninspiring cinematography, a forgettable soundtrack and no more character development than you'd expect from the average news report. The script is weak and the whole movie rather laboured.Despite this I'm not saying it's actually a bad film. It's not, it's just not a particularly good one. Overall, disappointing. But not a complete disaster. After all Ed Harris plays a bit of a blinder.",6,5,17,5 January 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Tim Burton back to his very best
","I have to confess from the outset to something of an on-off respect for Tim Burton. Whilst I loved the Nightmare before Christmas I was ambivalent about most of his other work and genuinely disliked The Corpse Bride and Beetlejuice. I am no great fan of Depp's either. Nevertheless, I am a huge fan of the whole Sweeney Todd story and Stephen Sondhiem's masterpiece on stage had the potential, as raw material, to raise Mr Burton's stock in my eyes. But only if he got it right.He did.Sweeney Todd is essentially an opera, not even a musical. It features wall to wall singing with what is hardly a stellar cast of musical talent: Rickman, Bonham-Carter, Depp, Baren - Cohen (Hilarious as the Italian Barber) and Timothy Spall are not exactly renowned in the hit parade. Fear not though. There is barely a bum note to be heard. The great thing about Sondhiem's majestic score is that it's not so much the technical singing ability as the passion, insight and energy that makes his music and stunning lyrics come to life. Add to that sublime art direction and cinematography and you have yourself a bleak gorefest full of humour and pathos.'There will be blood' I assumed. There was.Burton, for me, styles films as much as he directs them, but one cannot argue with the quality of performance he ekes out of his other half (Helena Bonham Carter). Mrs Lovett, the pie shop owner and Sweeney Todd fancier, is every bit as important a character as Sweeney himself and much of the film focuses on Bonham's adoration sadly, for her, reciprocated by an equal and opposite dismissal by Depp.The comedy is glorious too and Timothy Spall makes a lovely, grisly sidekick (the Beadle) to Alan Rickman's gloriously camped up Judge Turpin. Sacha Baron- Cohen's cameo appearance as Senor Adolfo Pirelli is laugh out loud.If you think you dislike opera make one exception in your life and see Sweeney Todd. As my 13 year old son would say It's a beast.",8,0,1,3 February 2008
Shutter Island," Someone is missing! Yeah. Scorsese.
","I don't want to be cast asunder for words of heresy but is Martin Scorsese losing it? I only ask because Shutter Island is a load of old claptrap. The reviews I've read seem to be unable to make their minds up about it and IMDb seems to have lost its marbles a little by awarding it 8.1 and a place in the coveted all time Top 250. Surely not for long when common sense kicks in and people review it for what it is. A mess.The movie really is a tram smash of ideas, styles and plotting. There's a neat twist in it but the utterly gratuitous Dachau strand to the movie is verging on the disgraceful. Parts of the film, certainly in the first half flashback to Di Capprio's experiences as an American GI liberating the Dachau concentration camp would be, you'd have thought, central to the plot. Not a bit of it. This strand hangs about meaningfully but without meaning. But that's the issue with this whole movie. It seems to want to inject meaning into a genre that really is just about entertainment. In doing so it lifts ideas from The Shining (some brilliantly), Silence of the Lambs (unconvincingly) and Hitchcock (at his worst) but they go nowhere. The cinematography flits about from the stunning, the scene in which DiCapprio and his young bride embrace during a fire is mesmerising, to the laughable - again DiCapprio is featured driving through a forest as a passenger with the Asylum's head warder in front of a blue-screened background that could have been shot in 1954 (the year the movie is set) - I suspect the latter was deliberate. If so it was another misguided idea.The grading leaps about from 21st century hi-def to 1950's colour-noir and can't seem to decide what it is that it wants to be.Dicapprio is unconvincing, so too Rufallo and Sir Ben Kingsley? Well, he is actually lampooning himself. Awful, truly awful.Do not waste your money on this rubbish.4 out of 10",4,23,48,14 March 2010
Life of Pi," truly wonderful
","I'd be tempted to give life of Pi this score out of 3 (3.1415926 5358979323846264338327950288419716939937510582097494459230781640 6286208998628034825342117067982148086513282306647093844609550582 23172535940812848111745028410270193852110555964462294895493038196 44288109756659334461284756482337867831652712019091456485669234603 48610454326648213393607260249141273724587006606315588174881520920 628292540917153643678925903600113305305488204665213841469519415116 09) but it so annoys me when people talk about giving 110% that I just can't do it.So, instead, I'll just have to settle for an old fashioned 9/10. Now, let's get this straight. Life of Pi has just shown that thereis life left in 3D. It may be, on the whole, a gimmick but the exception can still prove the point. Only two movies have made the 3D entrance fee worth the extra IMHO, Avatar and this. It's a tough movie for bibliophiles to even want to see because thebook is so magnificent (in my all time top ten probably) and many I've spoken to who love it equally are just downright scared that Ang Lee was going to blow it. The odds were strongly in favour ofthat happening because it's a pretty full on philosophical workout. So full credit has to go to Fox pictures for shelling out $120 million on the ultimate movie gamble. How Ang manages to retain the existential angst of the book AND make a blockbuster movie that holds the attention from start to finish (yes, including the pretty turgid first 100 pages) is not only anyone's guess but a cinematic achievement of considerable merit. It's the storytelling that wins the day but it's wrapped up in cinematography of the very highest order. So many times one gasps out loud at what's on screen that it's like a day out in a theme park. Surely the Oscar for this is certain to go to Claudio Miranda (Fight Club, Se7en, Zodiac, Benjamin Button). The acting is universally good but it's the tiger, Richard Parker, and his four legged companions that really steal the show. CGI has never, ever been this good. This might sound like it's the technology that carries the movie but don't think that. It's an honest, stunning exploration of the true meaning of life, religion and truth and it's an absolute must see. I would not discount it winning best movie come early March and I certainly wouldn't grudge it. Ang Lee's finest hour.",9,2,6,1 February 2013
Interstellar," Sci fi for the human race. supremely epic. A love poem to the human race.
","Well, Interstellar has met with a mixed reception from the critics, but not the paying viewers who are currently rating it #13 of all time on IMDb.I'm with the people.And I find it hard to understand why the critics have been so lukewarm. Yes, it's a movie about the entire human condition and saving the human race (which inevitably brings it into some potentially pretentious territory - it doesn't escape Scot free in that respect) but Christopher Nolan doesn't let that get in the way of a good story, carefully handled special effects, some tremendous casting (the young Jessica Chastain as Murphy is just SPECTACULAR and inspired), great acting (Hathaway and McConaughey really do pull it off - again).Christopher Nolan seems to be maturing rather well.I've seen most of his films and some tend to over-elaborate in the FX department. Not this. When he needs a big canvas, like the icy landscape of a potential planet for the human race to inhabit (in a far off galaxy reachable via a galaxian wormhole) he delivers it in spades. But it feels believable.I like Sci-fi that has a heart, like The Handmaids Tale, and this sure does, partly because of its big themes - the Earth is about to die because of global warming for a start - this grounds the movie and it effortlessly cuts between dystopian Earth and not much better alternatives far, far away.The crop burning and the dust storms that ravage the (earth) screen are biblical in their fury. The end of the world truly is nigh. But the alternative seems either worse or sort of non- existent for most of the movie.What binds it though is the remarkable relationship between McConaughey's character as the father of Murphy (Jessica Chastain) and her aforementioned younger self, played by Mackenzie Foy - the likeness is remarkable.When Nolan finally goes all Matrix/Inception (as he must) he does it amazingly, in a way that makes the whole movie; theory of relativity, gravity and time continuums, and all come together like a slo-mo implosion. It's awesome (sorry for using that word, but it's appropriate).Now: a postscript. This is a peaen to 2001: A Space Odyssey. We have many nods in deference to the almighty Kubrick in this movie. Not one of them any more than a doffing of the cap to one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived and I, for one, respect Nolan for that.This is surely Nolan's greatest movie and at 2hrs 47 mins it felt like a short.Bravo.(A final word. Hans Zimmer rocks in this movie. An outstanding soundtrack that will surely pick up yet another Oscar.)",9,1,5,1 December 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The greatest writing delivered in earth shattering performances. exquisite.
","You couldn't get more mid-American than Missouri. You'd be forgiven for not knowing that the state capital is Jefferson City. It's an unremarkable state and Ebbing is an unremarkable town (made up it would seem); it's not trailer trash, it's not deep south. It's just a nondescript, middle-class, American provincial town frequented by the usual mish-mash of not quite Hillbillys, not quite racists. They'd have voted for Trump in big numbers; if the place existed.It's here that Frances McDormand (just like in the unremarkable town of Fargo) stakes her claim for a place at the top table in the pantheon of greatest living actresses.It's here that Martin McDonagh cements his position as the greatest living comedy writer. (As if In Bruges wasn't enough, he's got his theatre canon of work to bolster those credentials - The Beauty Queen of Leenane and The Lieutenant of Inishmore are both comedic masterpieces.)And it's here that both Sam Rockwell and Woody Harrelson put in career defining (and probable Oscar winning) performances.To say that Frances McDormand has everything you need to be the complete actress is an understatement; she's hilarious, brutal, droll, moving, sympathetic, antagonistic, bombastic, arrogant, crazy, vulnerable, arch, facetious and deadpan. And that's only in the first 20 minutes. This will unquestionably win her, her second Oscar.And Martin McDonagh will pick up his second for best original screenplay (14 years after winning best short in 2004) and maybe even his third for best director. He already has no fewer than four (yes 4) nominations at the BAFTA's and I expect him to win at least half of them - because this is writing and direction of the very highest order. He's moved on since In Bruges. Sure the C bomb is dropped very early in the first dialogue scene and turns up several times more. But this is not the full pelt filth that Colin Farrell deployed to intense pleasure in the former.This is a subtler, equally dark but even more brutal exposition. Each word seems to have been crafted on a lathe. I gasped several times at the sheer dexterity of his writing delivered by masters of their craft.There's a dwarf, yes. There's an idiot, yes.But I ain't telling you no more than that. I saw it without spoilers so you deserve the same respect.It has a breathtakingly bold finish, I'll tell you that; spoiling nothing.This is cinema at its absolute finest.

Corpse Bride," A nightmare before Christmas...
",This is not really very good at all. I don't understand all these rave reviews. What went wrong? A Nightmare before Christmas is funny; has great music - also by Danny Elfman I believe; the story is delightfully subversive and the animation brilliant.Let's begin with the good news. The animation in Corpse Bride remains excellent. Particularly the use of highly chromatic grading in the 'dead world' contrasting deathly grading in the living world.In every other respect it is ponderous (in the extreme) in fact I fell asleep. Maybe I was just tired. Maybe it was just plain dull. Maybe both.But the truth is the story is no more than a tissue (it might have made a nice short) and the gags mostly lame and you could see them coming a mile off.Danny Elfman surely trotted this one off in his lunch hour. Possibly his worst soundtrack ever and in any case there wasn't that much for him to do.It's funny because the new Wallace and Gromit's a bit overrated too (but a lot more entertaining and far better scripted than this.) A project I feel. Not a passion. Sorry; I so wanted to like it too. So did my kids and they thought it was boring too.,4,3,7,2 November 2005
American Hustle," Some of this actually happened
","'Some of this actually happened' is the opening title, there are no credits, on the most pitch perfect movie since Argo and before that Magnolia.It's a mob movie with grifters.The ensemble cast is led gloriously, no miraculously, by Christian Bale (really? Christian Bale?) in perhaps the most astounding physical transformation since De Niro in Raging Bull.And what an ensemble. Bradley Cooper is hilarious throughout, not least because of his Starsky-esque tight perm and outrageous swagger.Amy Adams is simply electrifying – in so many movies she is brilliant but in this she is radiant. (Surely she will win at the Academy Awards at the fifth time of asking in the Spring).Jennifer Lawrence is gearing up to win as many awards as Meryl Streep as she glides effortlessly from franchise movie to big American Drama via the odd art-house number. She is wonderful.And then there is the unsung star; Jeremy Renner who plays an important leading subplot character role as the mayor of New Jersey.Maybe it's not surprising that the ensemble works so well because this cast has been Oscar nominated no less than 17 times; Cooper (once) Adams (4 times) Bale (Once and won for O'Russell's The Fighter) Renner (twice) Lawrence (Twice with one win) and in a supporting role De Niro (seven times winning twice). By the time March comes that will be at least 20.And then there's O'Russel, who is on fire. In my opinion he is now as good as PT Anderson with Oscar nods for this (surely), Silver Linings Playbook and The Fighter; his last three movies.It's a film you never want to end with a plot that twists and turns like a mongoose in a sack with a cobra. So it's impossible to plot spoil because it's so complex. But the writing is nailed on in every scene so that you are carried along on a wave of gasps and belly laughs (it really is very funny indeed).The camera-work (Linus Sandgren) is beautifully evocative of time and place (late 70′s New York).One scene in particular sees Amy Adams just about have actual real life sex in an ecstatic Studio 54 washroom trap, to the thudding soundtrack of 'I Feel Love'. It had me open mouthed. Indeed she achieves this effect more than once.In another, late in the film, Lawrence kisses Adams on the mouth so hard that she leaves all her lipstick behind. Spraying her territory. Marking Adams' cards. It's brilliant.(The kiss of a spiderwoman.) 'You're nothing to me until you're everything.' says Adams' character, Sydney Prosser, to Cooper's FBI agent. And this is possibly the central thought in the film.It's all about possession; of power, of women, of money.And it's what blinds the foolish and drives them to make wrong, ill thought out decisions that can have, and do have, monumental implications.The moral is; don't play with the big boys unless you've got your wits about you.Christian Bale most certainly has his.A resounding 10 out of 10.",10,5,9,6 January 2014
Rush," Rush? Hmmm, not sure you should actually
","There's much to admire in Ron Howard's biopic of the battle between Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl) and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth), not least both actors' portrayals of the leads and Howard's, at times, brilliant action sequences. Sad to say though there's a lot that simply doesn't work.Act 1 (the set up - early years) has moments of cringeworthy scripting and acting with little that engages (in fact I found myself wishing it was all over).Act 2 (the action sequences when 1976 is dramatically recreated, race by race) is mostly enthralling and really brings together all that is good about this movie (Bruhl, Hemsworth and Howard's direction).Act 3 (the denouement) is a missed opportunity. It's desperately rushed - despite its two hour length. I suspect an order from the studio to cut the timelength came into play with the consequence that it feels like an afterthought.What makes Rush worth seeing is the most important aspect of the movie, the bitter rivalry between Lauda and Hunt. Both actors uncannily capture the drivers' individual personalities but the script by The Queen writer Peter Morgan sometimes leaves them with nowhere to go, at others it dazzles, 'You're the only man that is better looking after skin grafts' quips Hunt to Lauda in Act 3; and Lauda's repeated statement that a 20% risk of death in each race is all that's acceptable is used well and resonates.It's the supporting actors that lets it down; an unconvincing Murray Walker, an unlikeable Lord Hesketh, Hunt's wife - all fail to convince. Only Alexandra Maria Lara, as Lauda's wife, strikes a real chord. At $38million this is a big budget movie for the UK. Its ambitions are clear to see. Just a shame the whole doesn't amount to more than the sum of its variable parts.Want to see a great motor racing movie?(There's very few of merit and despite my reservations this one's definitely among the elite.)

Nightcrawler," Gyllenhaal impresses as the least likable character you've seen in a long time.
","You leave the movie theatre with a slightly sick feeling of guilt after watching Nightcrawler. Guilt that you actually enjoyed this rather original movie-making set in an ethical and moral vacuum. In that sense the movie is entirely ironic. You shouldn't be enjoying this stuff.It's an exposition of entirely greed-induced (financial and ego driven) naked ambition that rivals Wolf of Wall Street for it's blithe abandon of normal ethical practice.Gyllenhaal, as Louis Bloom, almost cadaverous after his dramatic weight loss for the part, is as unsympathetic a movie character as you've seen in a very long time. His back story, which is precisely zilch, renders him a character in search of a meaning. A loner, a drifter, a thief, unemployed (unemployable is the truth) and entirely without remorse - emotion for that matter - stumbles upon a freelance career as an, at first hapless then really rather good, ambulance chasing 'scene of the crime' news cameraman.Starting with motorway crashes and graduating to suburban crime scenes (where the threat of middle America being intruded upon by 'Hispanics' and other Liberal American ethnic minorities) he captures more and more challenging newsreel material that feeds the sensation-lust of an LA loser News Station's News Editor, Nina Romina, played deliciously by Rene Russo.Romina's sponsorship of, and belief in, the expert blagging of Bloom feeds his desire for greater success and indeed for Romina herself. In a toe curling 'date' at a camp Mexican restaurant Bloom lays it on the line with Romina in a scene of toe-curling embarrassment. It's as if Gyllenhaal is playing for laughs, but he's deadly serious.Throughout, Gyllenhaal commands the screen. The Nightime lighting constantly picking out his skeletal, eye bulging look that makes him look like the devil incarnate. This truly is an evil character and Gyllenhaal's trademark smirk only adds to the perverse sense of evil pleasure he is gaining as his success mushrooms.A recurring theme in the movie is his watering of a pot plant in his flat. It's as if it's the only living thing he cares two bucks about. Certainly his hapless sidekick/assistant Rick, played by Riz Ahmed, has next to no chance in this little hothouse world of emotion-free ambition.Gyllenhaal's faux management style 'development' of Rick is at times darkly amusing but usually just plain vacuous and ironic given that he draws from real world self help and management lingo that's bad enough in the corporate world, but downright bizarre in this micro universe.The car chases are gripping edge of seat affairs, the plot, although it has holes in the final reel (quite big ones I felt) is nevertheless highly original and unfolds at a steady pace.The conclusion was, to my mind at least, a little disappointing, but aside from this a good, dark, star vehicle for Jake and possibly a step towards another best actor nomination.",7,194,279,31 October 2014
Bohemian Rhapsody," Parlous trash.
","Where to start on how parlous this movie is?I'll be brief.Let's begin at the end. In this day and age the recreation of Live Aid - that had many people drooling was, to me, like an early episode of Crossroads, all shoogly sets and appalling cutaways.Do you really expect me to believe that the 'entourage' was gasping in the wings of the real Wembley?Do you really expect me to believe that Rami Malek was performing in front of THAT crowd?Now, let's consider Rami Malek.Are you seriously asking me to salute you (the Academy) for awarding best actor to him in front of, for one, Bradley Cooper? I've seen every single best actor winner since 1994 and each and every one of them put in a better performance.Wearing prosthetic teeth does not the great actor make.The film is a pathetic wash over of a tragic life turned into a Hollywood fairytale.It is utter garbage. With good tunes.2 stars",4,1,8,24 September 2019
Baby Driver," Whatever. Certainly not a patch on Tarantino in the coolness stakes.
","The poster says that Baby Driver is the coolest movie of the summer.  I don't know that that aspiration is king size but in my view it fails to achieve even those unlofty heights.It is QUITE cool but it's reliance on music as a key plot device requires the music to be cool as...It isn't.The anchor song, Queen's Brighton Rock, isn't even Queen's coolest song.  Not by a long way.The title credits, where our hero (Baby) walks the streets of Atlanta to the sound of Harlem Shuffle is clever as the lyrics pop up as street graffiti, shop names and so on but it's trying soooo hard.The car chases are invariably high quality but I felt some of the casting was a bit gash.  Love interest, Lily James, doesn't cut the mustard and Baby (Ansel Elgort) created no real empathy.But the biggest crime is the OST.  Come on guys you could have done better than that.  Apart from Hocus Pocus by Focus and Egyptian Reggae by Jonathan Richman it was just kind of meh!  It ain't no Tarantino soundtrack.  Now THAT's cool.Jamie Foxx is largely unintelligible. But John Hamm and Kevin Spacey put in good, professional efforts.This movie aspires to coolness, but it left me a little cold.",5,8,18,7 July 2017
The Revenant," A great movie tarnished by Tom Hardy.
","In Iñárritu's sixth full length outing (his fourth English language movie) he makes a change in direction, although much of his interest in the human spirit and particularly the afterlife, fuelled presumably by his Catholic upbringing in Mexico, remains in place. He describes The Revenant as a 'Grizzly thriller' and that's a fair summation, although the pace is often really quite slow.What Iñárritu excels at is creating a mood of intimacy and foreboding that characterises this epic journey from start to finish. In one sense it's an unashamed star vehicle for Leonardo Di Caprio who must surely sway the Academy judges to finally reward him with his long sought best actor statue, for this is a truly remarkable and physical performance from an actor that has deserved the formal acknowledgement of his peers for several years.The photography, unaided by anything other than nature itself, is both oppressive (often downright gloomy in the Albertan and British Columbian winter) and intense. More than once Di Caprio's breath unapologetically fogs the lens, so close is the filming. But it can also be beautiful in its naturalistic capture of the rivers, and particularly the forests, of its locations.The music by Ryuichi Sakamoto quite often dominates scenes with its full orchestral chords booming across the barren and forlorn landscapes that are doing their best to destroy Di Caprio's character, Hugh Glass.It's a tale of revenge, but more importantly of determination and faith ( in both the human spirit and in God). Iñárritu draws on religious iconography, as he often does, to represent the afterlife because, through much of the movie, death is either a sudden outcome for many of the cast or is imminent for Glass. Recurring themes are the angelic dream-state vision of his dead Native Indian wife floating in mid air and an image of a foreboding hill of skulls (representing Golgotha, AKA Calvary). These dream states sit alongside a number of set pieces (the Grizzly fight in particular) in which special effects are put to quite remarkable effect, but these are short episodes in what is essentially a tortuous journey from near death.The story goes like this. A gang of 44 fur hunters/traders are attacked by a posse of Native Indians seeking the daughter of the chief who has been taken by another group of traders.These guys are in no mood for taking prisoners and lay waste to the fur traders' settlement. We then follow a small band of trapper brothers who escape (including Hugh Glass) but it quickly becomes apparent that they are no harmonious group and one in particular, Fitzgerald, played woefully in my opinion by Tom Hardy (really, his backwoodsman dialect is unintelligible and this ruins nearly all of the narrative scenes in the film), has money and self interest at heart. When Glass is attacked and nearly killed by a Grizzly Bear Fitzgerald is left to look after him, for a bounty, while the remaining group head back to the traders' fortified settlement on the other side of the Rockies.Rather than looking after Glass, Fitzgerald abandons him, killing his half-cast son and sets off to reclaim his bounty. What follows is a long and tortuous adventure as Glass seeks refuge back at camp. It's a Bear Grylls expedition of monumental proportions with plenty of adventure, much misery and very little in the way of food.This isn't Iñárritu's best movie (despite all the awards). There are serious flaws in the believability of Glass' survival techniques and Tom Hardy knocks a full point off my rating for his irritating and wilfully obscure, frankly preposterous, dialect. But put that to one side and you have an adventure epic that bears little comparison. It hangs onto Iñárritu's art-house sensitivities and it serves up a number of fantastic scenes that will stick long in the viewer's mind.I give it a 7/10. Sorry Tom. You blew it.",7,0,3,17 January 2016
The Shining," Watching the shining and no work makes Jack a dull boy
","I thought i'd write this without reading the other posts because I didn't want to be influenced by them. The Shining is quite simply the best horror film ever made and will not, repeat will not, ever be bettered because mostly the makers of horror films work to a cheap trick agenda.Now, the fact that this is a Stephen King story is all the more remarkable because, let's be honest he ain't going to win any literary prizes and how on earth could the grand master, Mr K, spot the potential of this story from Stephen King's vast repertoire? Ultimately it doesn't matter because we, the viewers, are treated to the scariest movie ever, the most delightfully subversive in terms of misogyny, that almost gets away with it because of the movie's setting. It's a bit of a crazy place to be! And we'd all go crazy and misogynistic there. Wouldn't we? If there was an Oscar for locations then unquestionably the hotel would have won it, in fact it would have won a lifetime achievement award.The whole cast excels of course and I cannot find higher praise than 'perfection'.Only one other film meets its level of perfection for me and that is PT Anderson's Magnolia and it goes without saying that that is a very different movie.",10,1,2,25 February 2006
The White Ribbon," Intense and very rewarding
","Michael Haneke; infant terrible of the art cinema world is not to everyone's taste. He doesn't exactly make action movies.But the movie did win the Palme d'or at Cannes this year so certainly the critics liked it.It's long and it moves at a slow but steady pace. It's black and white (often dimly lit) but beautifully realised. In fact at times the cinematography is so beautiful that it's like a moving Ansell Adams. It is variously graded throughout with the merest hint of a cream or a brown creeping in from time to time that creates some variety. It's mesmerising.And it's weird. Really weird.Apparently, and this is not blindingly obvious, it is an allegorical take on the birth of fascism.It's yet another movie where the heavy hand of religion gets the blame for most evil. The pastor of the remote German village that it is set in, in the lead up to the First World War, is a central character and is the sort we've seen many times before (The Magdalene Sisters being a good example). Outwardly pious; inwardly, and to his family, a callous and vicious bastard. Quick to blame, shame and moralise. His presence throughout is powerful and visceral.The dawning of fascism is subtly portrayed because no politics enter the film overtly at any point. Class wars and sexual politics do though in what is clearly a male dominated culture and one where sexual transgression is rife (child abuse, domestic abuse, illicit masturbation and secret affairs are all featured).But it's the children (spookily played by one and all in a sort of village of the damned way) that steal the film. They appear to be forces of evil and if not (the plot is never explained and the strange occurrences left to hang - it is Haneke after all) they are certainly victims of it.Haneke seems to be saying that the rise of fascism came out of this age of suppression and a sense of revenge - after all the destruction of the Jews is often taken as a form of revenge for their post WWI success.Haneke makes films like only Haneke makes films. Some people find them slow and boring. I think he follows in the style of that French New Wave of the 60's but with a better grip on audience manipulation. He makes thought provoking masterpieces and this is another one.Simply wonderful.",9,85,119,15 November 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," This movie proves that Hollywood can do art-house. Again. The Swedish must be gutted.
","For the second time in as many years Hollywood has come out to face up to the competition from outstanding Swedish cinema with remakes that, at the time of announcement, seemed indecently hasty.Cashing in, one might conject? Maybe so, as the movies in question, 'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' and 'Let me in' could both b e accused of copying the Swedish originals quite closely.So, Boxing Day in the UK saw the much anticipated Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, stateside version, hit our screens and boy does the US cinema industry once again show that it can hold its own against European art house with some ease.The original (Swedish) movie, which was adapted from a mega hit novel by Steigg Larson, was outstanding.This reviewer gave it an IMDb score of 9.0. So how does this compare? In a word. Admirably.Indeed the US version actually communicates the story slightly more clearly than the Swedish adaptation (and that's not a comment about subtitles).The fact is, David Fincher is on fire and he has once again crafted a thriller that sits proudly alongside Se7en.The film opens with a thundering, and truly awesome, cover of Led Zepellin's Immigrant Song by Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose (the Social Network) - there's a nice touch early in the movie when Lisbeth's go to man for forgeries appears wearing a NIN T shirt - and the opening credits, again like se7en are worthy of an Oscar in their own right. Brilliantly mixing oil and flame (a theme that bookends the movie) they set the scene to perfection.Black. Black as you can get.You'll probably know the plot if you're reading this so I won't go into it; it's a complex and interwoven tale of historical murder and modern day defamation mixing religion, Nazism and extreme sexual torture, but it's all handled with a restraint that makes it all the more shocking in a directorial masterclass by Fincher. With the exception of the brutally bad Benjamin Button, Fincher is building a body of work (including The Social Network, Fight Club, Zodiac The Panic Room and Se7en) that makes him the current king of the thriller and one of the best and most reliable directors in Hollywood.Daniel Craig is very good in this but Rooney Mara blows him away with a performance every bit as good as Roomi Rapace's in the Swedish version.This is a languid, but often shocking, storytelling experience. It's a great movie. Sure, it's only really a pseudo cop film but it's got everything that anyone loves about great film making could hope to see in a luxuriant 156 minutes.Magic. 9/10",9,3,9,28 December 2011
Dunkirk," Christopher Nolan reaches yet another new high with this brilliant movie,
","In a movie that entirely engulfs you it's rather unusual that the acting performances are almost unimportant.  Yes, Mark Rylance, as ever, puts no foot wrong but this is not a movie about acting. This is a movie about visceral experience.This is a movie about paying double the price to experience it in an iMax.  Pay it man.Christopher Nolan does not do anything less than 8.0 IMDb movies.  His class is overwhelming.  Interstellar blew me away with its imagination but this is a step up even again.And one of the reasons for that is his relationship with Hams Zimmer.  This movie's extraordaryness starts with the music which feeds off the utterly spectacular sound design by ( Help me I can't find it on IMDb) xxx.  You are overwhelmed by the sound from frame 1.  Remember Saving Private Ryan?  Remember how you winced in your cinema seat.  That was the sound.  Now square that.  Hell, no.  Cube it.Now, think how Saving Private Ryan Looked.  Think about how you squirmed in your seat.  Cube that too.Now, think how after the first 20 minutes (if we are all honest her) it got a bit dull.THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN WITH CHRISTOPHER NOLAN.Christopher Nolan is the gift that just keeps giving.This movie gives and gives and then gives a little more.Costume, photography, sound, SFX (not much in CGI if anything) are all awesome.This is an actual masterpiece.I think it will min multiple Oscars, including best movie and director, with the rare distinction of no acting medals. (I hereby predict 10 Oscars.)It's a straight 10/10.",10,5,13,25 July 2017
Control," Closer
","Much debate was had at the time as to whether Joy Division's second album 'closer' was pronounced with a soft s, as in; nearby, or a hard one as in; the end. Of course the latter won through because of the inevitable consequences of Ian Curtis' life.I was a 'fan' of Joy Division at the time, being of an impressionable age (IC died on the day of my 18th birthday) but I was nowhere near as influenced by them as I was by Hooky and the boys when New Order took over. Indeed Blue Monday is probably my seminal song of all time.So, I didn't go into the movie theatre all agush.If anything, what I might have gushed at would be Anton Corbijn's cinematography, because I was more in awe of him as NME's seemingly resident photographer than I was of Joy Division.However, for the first two acts of this movie Joy Division rose above my love of New Order because this was Joy Division - not a Joy Division tribute band. It was Joy Division because Anton caught them as he did in 1979, albeit a little less grainy. No question.Their music rocked, but more importantly rolled. Joy Division's drumming is often overlooked because Ian Curtis took centre stage so powerfully, but make no mistake, Stephen Morris was an integral part of the Joy Division sound.So, to the film. Anton Corbijn you would hope/expect to cinematograph well, but direct? Oh yes.Oh yes he can direct.He does of course have the talent of Samantha Morton at his beck and call and she has guaranteed a BAFTA for this one. She is brilliant.At the start of the film she is a dippy love-stuck teenager, and believable with it. As the film progresses she deals with the disintegration of her marriage in about as understated and believable way as you could possibly imagine.Now, Sam Riley, as Ian Curtis looks the part. That is well documented. But he also plays the part. It would be so easy to go OTT in this performance, but he controls it (perhaps a clue from the movie title).His performance is quite simply, immaculate.As act three and the real point of the film unfolds we lose Joy Division and we find the Curtis' and the Belgian lover of Curtis in a true love story. It is moving, beautiful, sad and nailed! Totally nailed. And for a movie bio pic to do that one can do no less than award 10 out of 10.Stunning.",10,3,5,2 November 2007
No Country for Old Men," Bang bang you're dead
","Although Josh Brolin, playing Llewelyn Moss, is ostensibly the star of the Cormac McCarthy story, his faultless performance is overshadowed by that of Javier Bardem - the 'hood' Anton Chigurh. Bardem's performance is unquestionably the stuff of Oscars and every time he hits the screen the effect is electrifing. Seemingly inhuman (other than the time he spares the life of an old petrol station owner on the toss of a coin) he radiates evilness.Set in Texas and on the Mexican border in 1980 the tale verges at times on the preposterous as a tangled web involving trailer trash opportunist, Moss, stumbles upon$2 million dollars as the result of a shoot out between rival Mexican gangs at the handover of a truck load of drugs. Instead of handing it into the police like any good boy would do he decides to keep it and there then follows an elaborate chase to get the money back, led by Bardem , The Mexican's hired hand. It is much complicated by the simultaneous tracking of Moss by, but the other Mexican gang, a Private detective/hit-man, Woody Harrelson, and a 'whatever' Police Sheriff, the world and police force-weary Tommy Lee Jones who is nearing his retirement.In the middle of it all sits the vulnerable and utterly convincing wife of Moss played beautifully by Kelly MacDonald. What a repertoire she has - her range is astonishing and she is quickly becoming one of Scotland's greatest actresses ever.The title is in some aways a parody. It's difficult to reach old age in this racket and the deaths clock up on a regular basis. but also it represents the central theme of the movie which rotates around Thornton's imminent retirement and the memory of his father, also a copper, who died young (in his 40's).It is a movie about death and has strong ethical and moral undertones. Although he has little screen time it is Thornton who is, in reality, the central protagonist as it is he who bookends the action with his reflections on life and its meaning.The action is pretty grizzly but rarely gratuitous, as the Coen's have chosen to direct it lightly - no great epic cinematography, no music AT ALL - it's almost a Hollywood Dogme film and that adds greatly to its impact.Heavy-handed direction, big scores, florid cinematography; all would have turned the preposterousness of the tale into a preposterous movie. As it is, it succeeds effortlessly in being the movie the great mafia directors (Coppola, Mann, Scorsese) would die for. In the hands of Tarantino the film might have become a parody of the book.The Coen Brothers are very, very good filmmakers. This is a very, very good Coen Brothers film.9 out of 10.",9,3,10,10 February 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Near perfection
","I confess, I've been slow getting round to this. I was given it on DVD for Christmas and what a gift because this is one masterpiece of a movie. As it progressed it became clearer and clearer to me that the brooding and grumbling soundtrack (all instrumental) sounded distinctly like Nick Cave and so it transpired; written as it was by him and his Bad Seed partner Warren Ellis (the Big Beardy one). The soundtrack is only one of the great perfections of this movie, because like everything in it it sticks like Araldite together in perfect symmetry.Let's turn to the cinematography by Roger Deakins. This is photography at its very finest and he won an Oscar this year (but not for this which was surely the runner up). He won it for No Country For Old Men which I have raved about elsewhere. What sets the photography apart here is that he introduces a strange stressing of the picture at certain points (when the narrator speaks mainly I think) and my guess is that this is to reflect Jesse James' failing eyesight which is referred to early in the movie.Now the casting. You will surely never see a greater Brad Pitt performance and Casey Affleck as the Coward Robert Ford who first idolises and then vilifies James is quite outstanding and rightly was Oscar nominated for the performance.The story is a little tricky to follow because a lot of characters are referred to in contexts that one might not understand if not a student of Jesse James; which I'm not. Anyway, it hangs around James' final days in which he's taking more risks than he should. His gang is breaking up and his loyal recruits ain't as loyal as they used to be. James knows this (or at least senses it) and you see him become increasingly paranoid in a way that Daniel Day Lewis totally over-blew in There will be Blood (for my money this a far better movie with a far subtler exposition of madness and the pursuit of a different kind of power).As the film progresses the young (19) Thomson becomes completely dis-enamoured of his erstwhile childhood hero (for many, James was the Robin Hood of America) and sees instead only James' self driven anger and thirst for revenge. To gain the £100,000 bounty on his head Ford and his brother Charlie (also brilliantly played by Sam Rockwell) plot to overthrow him.In the end the moment of execution is an anticlimax for the pair (but not the viewer) in that James seemingly surrenders and takes a bullet to the back of the head.At first lauded (mildly) Ford soon sees the backlash as America proclaims him not a hero but a coward for killing an unarmed man by shooting him in the back of the head. Ford's life is ended in a further revenge killing and the whole futility of it all becomes apparent.I cannot recommend this film highly enough. Long it may be (2h 40min) but it's all the better for that because we never really wanted it to end.Bravo 10/10",10,3,6,4 January 2010
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Stunningly realised laugh out loud funny. Wes Anderson's finest yet.
","Wes Anderson divides opinion. Of that there can be no debate.This movie will divide opinion. Of that there is no doubt.But it is a work of very great merit because it takes the medium and turns it upside down. This movie melds slapstick with performance art, melodrama with interior design, comedy with tragedy and it makes Ralph Feinnes a little bit godlike (something I never thought I'd never catch myself saying). Feinnes' central performance in this movie is mesmerising. Half terribly polite, terribly gay aristocrat, half rampantly heterosexual (having bedded half the female population of the fictitious Zubrowka, a European alpine state). He swears like a trooper, in the most inappropriate way in an ever so pukka accent that just doesn't seem right.He leads us through the proceedings with such dexterity that you cannot possibly guess what is coming next, aided throughout by his sidekick - the 17 year old Lobby Boy Zero Mustapha played by Tony Revolori (he looks about 10, perhaps exacerbated by his hilarious hand drawn moustache). The movie is mainly shot in flashback as the older Zero Mustapha (H. Murray Abraham) recalls the tale of how he came to own what was once a grand edifice but is now entirely run down and frequented by a bunch of random loners.The tale is, of course, ridiculous and involves murder, robbery, disputed wills and the most outrageous jail break you will ever see in your life.The flashback element is framed in a perfect square - a screen shape not seen since the silent era (it's not even 4:3 aspect ratio it's 4:4. Although it's described as 1:37 on IMDb - not so). Frame after frame brings delight. The attention to detail in propping, in background asides, in costume and in the comic use of animation or manipulated film speed (the sledge scene is a hoot) adds layer upon layer and makes the movie a must see again to pick out what you missed the first time.The cast list is too long to list here but I counted 13 bona fide A listers. Spot them if you can as some of them aren't on screen long (an unrecognisable Tilda Swinton, for example, departs after about 5 minutes).Repeatedly Anderson uses repetition in his script and it's laugh out loud funny every time.How good was it? Well, put it this way, I ain't ever seen an audience burst into almost universal spontaneous applause on a rainy Tuesday night outside of a film festival.That's how good it is.",9,2,10,22 March 2014
The Favourite," Period drama for the #MeToo generation.
","I am a big, big fan of Yorgos Lanthimos whose two previous deadpan comedic features (The Killing of a Scared Deer and The Lobster) are outstanding movies.The feature of both of these movies is Lanthimos' extremely black humour delivered in a unique style.However, for The Favourite Lanthimos has taken a big decision in abandoning the scriptwriting and handing the duties over to Deborah Davis (her debut) and Tony McNamara (lots of minor TV but no cinema history). It's a strange choice of writing team because they don't bring any previous to the mix, and neither are fresh-faced youths. But what they bring is an entirely different tonality to Lanthimos' work and that leaves him to focus on direction, with cinematography provided by Robbie Ryan, who made a big contribution (in my view) to American Honey. Indeed, the cinematography is a major talking point after the writing. Gone is Lanthimos' naturalistic, almost clinical, lighting of the Lobster and 'Deer' instead, although we again go au natural, it's through a gloom of candle and fire light that renders the screen largely black for a great deal of its 2+ hours.His frequent choice of extreme wide angle (almost fish eye) lens to capture the scale of the huge palace rooms is highly unusual in cinema and is much more like stills photography. One scene, shot in a long corridor, makes it look like a u-bend when in fact it is completely straight - unlike the principal characters!But the real meat here is this terrific all female star line-up. In the #MeToo era this is a real vote of confidence in female actors with attitude and sheer quality. Come March it is entirely possible that all of the leads; Olivia Coleman (national treasure that she is), Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone will be career Oscar winners because Coleman's performance is quite brilliant. The other two already hold this distinction and each has a good chance of adding to their trophy haul.Although, As Queen Anne, Coleman (who gained 2.5 stone to play the gout-ridden Queen's part) is the designated lead, the film is essentially a three player ensemble with some ineffectual men put into bat to be made to look ridiculous and, oh, they do in Sandy Powell's outrageous costumes and Beverley Binda's even more outrageous hair and make up. ('You look like a dead badger' Weisz tells the Queen as she sets out on a royal engagement.)The story echoes All About Eve as Queen Anne's favourite lady in waiting, and lesbian lover, Lady Sarah Marlborough, The Wife of the Duke of Marlborough who is leading the war with France, is gradually pushed out of favouritism by one time lady and now servant girl, Abigail (Emma Stone). Although she does not go without fight.This is where the scriptwriting team get the nod to create a bawdy and vicious rivalry set in a Draughtsman Contract-esque world.Overindulgence, poisoning and illness leads to all three leads vomiting at least once each, reflecting this world of excess.The music track is at times intrusive, but to my mind in a good way; it's a sort of early 18th Century version of Atticus Rose and Trent Resnor's soundtrack to The Social Network.What everyone is talking about is the lead performances. Each is supremely talented and each is given so much scope to truly flex their acting muscles that what results is an acting master-class. In the trailer it seems like a knockabout farce but in reality the movie is actually quite slow-paced with moments of true hilarity and enough foul language to shock some of our more prurient audience members. That said, my wife who abhors the C-word volunteered that it was used to great effect several times in this.The lesbian relationships Queen Anne enjoyed are worthy of note. In a life that saw her lose 17 children (5 still born and many miscarried) her tipping of the velvet was, apart from a bulimic relationship with food, one of her few pleasures. Both Lady Marlborough and Abigail are adept in their duty to pleasure their monarch.The first half belongs to Rachel Weisz but Coleman steadily comes into her own as the movie progresses. Emma Stone plays a beautifully judged and paced role in which she will do anything to get ahead - but in the end it's Coleman who wins the day, with the last 20 minutes belonging to her as she suffers the consequences of the vagaries of her life. Her portrayal of Queen Anne as a stroke victim is as good a performance as you will see anywhere this year.It's a fascinating movie, although I'm not convinced it's quite as good as its hype. That said, for lovers of history and lovers of Olivia Coleman it has to be seen.",8,6,16,8 January 2019
Foxcatcher," Burn baby burn. (Slowly)
","OK I admit I am late to the party on this one but I missed Foxcatcher's fairly limited release in the UK and have only finally viewed it on DVD. But it was worth the wait.It's a uniquely paced thriller in that it's almost plot less. The dynamics and emotional drivers of all the main protagonists, two wresting brothers (Mark Ruffalo and Channing Tatum) and their errr 'mentor' (Steve Carell), are never revealed. It's sinister from start to finish but it's never entirely clear why it's sinister particularly if, like me, you don't know the story that it's based on.But suffice it so say the direction by Bennett Miler (two Oscar nominations under his belt now for this and Capote) is outstanding and grips you from start to finish, despite the fact that very little of any consequence actually happens.There's an elephant in the movie theatre with this film. And that is homosexuality. Lots of men getting sweaty and grappling with one another on the floor is not the point. It's the unstated relationship between the two main characters that is.Is the relationship between billionaire wrestling freak Du Pont and Schwartz homosexually charged? Maybe yes, maybe no. Du Pont may wish to be seen as a father figure but it goes much deeper than that in my view.Is the drug taking and drinking that Du Pont introduces to his Olympic Gold medallist charge some form of seduction? Maybe yes, maybe no.Is the relationship that Du Pont 'enjoys' with his mother also related to his sexuality (Oedipal almost)? Maybe yes, maybe no.Certainly it has enraged the real life Schwartz who clearly is not in any way inclined to the male sex but that's not the point. Miller has created a movie that is undeniably homo- erotically charged and that is not in any way a criticism.The movie is a beautiful enigma wrapped up in a conundrum and all the better for it.But ultimately what you are left with is the extraordinary performances of Tatum and, especially, Carell in a career defining outing that will surely be hard for him to beat. And one last point; the outstanding soundtrack by Rob Simonsen is a pretty fundamental contribution to the whole mood of the piece.",8,3,4,12 October 2015
It Follows," Completely original. Certain to become a classic. Wonderful addition to the best of horror lists.
","SPOILER: It Follows begins how it ends. Mysteriously. A young woman runs from her suburban home half dressed, terrified, confused.She crosses the road haphazardly, then runs back to her house picks up her bag and escapes in her car, with her father shouting after her trying to work out what the hell is going on.It is not explained.The movie then unfolds. No captions. No narrative. It just unwraps itself in a way I have never seen in horror.Whilst it nods at convention (the music is unquestionably influenced by early John Carpenter and the cast is a bunch of Sorority kids) it is completely original in every other way. It's beautifully shot, carefully scripted without a single ham line and has a plot that is entirely unpredictable.The basic premise is this. A 'thing' (monster, demon, zombie, entity: call it what you like) is passed between couples having sex. And then it follows the 'host' until it is passed on to the next host, again following sex. It manifests itself as a sort of walking zombie that follows the host. Should it catch them it will not only kill them but possibly all those in the chain behind.That's easy to understand. What isn't is how our heroine Jay, played beautifully by Maika Monroe, attempts to resolve her plight. Really, this is a rare horror performance, understated and properly acted. Her fear is palpable. And she doesn't go wandering into unlit basements every five minutes. It's up there with Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween.However, the plot becomes pretty confusing, but it kind of doesn't matter because throughout this great movie you're just taken in by its vitality, outstanding cinematography, freshness and the endless MacGuffins.Seriously there must be 20 times you're expecting to be scared to death (Hitchcock style musical and SFX builds) only for nothing to happen.Anyone walking slowly in this movie could be the 'entity' and that's repeatedly used as a trick. Another great thing about it is the setting in Detroit. It's never overplayed but it adds a decaying creepiness that is entirely appropriate.It's a great addition to the world of horror. Not as terrifying as some say, but absorbing and pure quality from start to startling finish.",8,176,329,6 March 2015
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great but not his best
","To describe any Tarantino film as less than excellent would be, in my opinion, sacrilege. So let's cut to the chase here. This is excellent.The question is...how excellent? And how 'acceptable'.And that's where deconstructing Once Upon a Time in Hollywood becomes tricky.It's most similar in its narrative structure, I'd say, to Pulp Fiction, probably his flawed masterpiece, in that it doesn't really have one. I mean there's kind of a story, a long one, but I don't think that's what he set out to do here.He set out to capture the fragility of two fading performers; one a star actor (DiCaprio) and one a star stunt man (Brad Pitt).That the movie's triumph lies in the hands of Pitt rather than DiCaprio is interesting. Probably DiCaprio has more screen time, but Pitt has more presence. And Pitt is coping better with his fall from grace.It's almost a portmanteau (I know my friends say I'm a pretentious for using that word) but it is a THING. Usually a portmanteau is a loosely linked collection of short films under a kind of director's curation.Here, though, I think it is a sort of continuous dream sequence, of beautiful but uneventful linking scenes, between big 'pieces' - the portmanteaus - it's like walking through an art gallery enjoying a painter's studies before BOOM, here's the big canvas.Tarantino creates 8 or 9 stunning canvases. One of the most affecting, for me, being the beautiful and funny scene DiCaprio shares with 8 year old Julia Butters as his method acting co star in a last chance Hollywood western.To say the one scene of violence is a career high would be to both underestimate it and potentially spoil the movie so I won't disclose where, when or how it happens, like the best of Tarantino it is unexpected and both viscerally shocking and hilarious.One of my female companions only had eyes for the stunningly handsome Brad Pitt (there's quite a diet Coke moment about an hour in - and I have ordered the Champion Spark Plugs T Shirt) and I thought he stole the show (see above), but let's not gloss over DiCaprio. He's great. But the devil has the best tunes.Margot Robbie is no more than a muse, and wasted. He does that a lot - does Quentin - a weakness. Uma Thurman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Pam Grier have bucked the trend, but it's rare to leave a Tarantino screening with the actresses front of mind.Is he a masoginist? No, I don't think so, but close, but it's the guys that get the greater spoils in the master's work.The other question the film undoubtedly raises though is...is he racist? Uncomfortable, yes, but I felt pretty creeped out by the Bruce Lee scene where Karate and eastern fighting arts are pretty much laughed off the screen in the Bruce Lee fight scene. I didn't find it acceptable actually.The music has been hailed as a masterpiece, but for me it's one of his weaker selections. Trying to cram too much in.The styling, though, is exquisite, as is the cinematography.Overall I'd rank it as in the upper half, just, of his repertoire. But what do you think?I'd go.Kill Bill Part 1

Gone Girl," A fantastically plotted thriller that's as good as the hype. More magic from Fincher.
","David Fincher doesn't do bad movies, what with Fight Club, Thee Social Network, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Se7en, Zodiac and, for those that liked it, Benjamin Button under his beltOf late, neither does Gone Girl's star, Ben Affleck (Argo was awesome, although I'm not so sure how good I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meathook, and Now I Have a Three Picture Deal at Disney was).So it was no real surprise that Gone Girl really does live up to its hype. I've not read the book but I'm reliably informed that it's very true to it (perhaps not surprising given that the screenplay was by the novel's author, Gillian Flynn).I'm not going to spoil the plot here because it's very much plot driven with more twists than Chubby Checker, but in my opinion it's a right riveting two and a half hours; yes two and a half hours!Essentially it's a did he (Affleck) didn't he, murder his wife vehicle in which the possible killer's motives and evidence veer massively from 'of course he didn't' to 'of course he did' and back again several times. The action unfolds in four acts, each slowly releasing its story before you hit a 'did that just really happen?' moment. And Fincher is the perfect guy to handle this as a proved master of plot development. The result is that you are slowly but surely drawn deeper and deeper into its labyrinthine construct as the movie progresses.The supporting cast is led by Rosamund Pike who, as the Gone Girl, gets a lot of screen time but fails to clear the bar set by Affleck. There's something miscast about her, she just isn't all that attractive as a person - that would be my only real criticism of the film. Aside from her there's affecting performances by Carrie Coon as Nick's (Affleck's) twin sister and Kim Dickens as the main investigating cop (a bit of a nod to Frances McDormand in Fargo in the way she plays it). Tyler Perry plays a neat part as the defence lawyer although it's a relatively small part.I really liked this movie. Although whether it retains its place in IMDb's top 80 movies of all time for long remains to be seen.",8,1,8,14 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino pulls it off yet again.
","I'm not qualified to comment on the historical authenticity of Quentin Tarantino's fully committed depiction of black American slavery in 1858 but I'm as qualified as anyone else to share with you why I, personally, think this is another significant contribution to one of the greatest movie directing careers of all time.With Django (the D's silent you know) Tarantino cements his position in the top 10.This is epic, just as Kill Bill (1 and 2) was, and proves that long movies don't have to be padded out indulgences. It grows in its impact with every scene and ends up a classic.Spike Lee has problems with the depiction of slavery and I have to respect that as I, like Tarantino, am Caucasian. At times it does seem to mock the plight of America's black slaves but I feel sure that Samuel L Jackson (virtually unrecognisable) and Jamie Foxx saw more than a wage in choosing to star in it and I'm sure too that the judges of the Black Reel Awards which have given it six nominations are qualified to judge it on its merits as opposed to its politics.Although described as a (spaghetti) western this is really a movie about slavery and not since 'Roots' has African American slavery been so prominently featured on screen. Tarantino does not shy away from the subject matter or the vernacular of the time. 'Nigger' is used over 100 times in the script and not just by the slaves. I had to refer to my copy of Filthy English: The How, Where, When and What of Everyday Swearing by Pete Silverton to establish whether or not MotherF@£$%er was currency in 1858 but there is evidence that points to its validity. Just as well, because Samuel L J can't really get through a movie without saying it repeatedly and he does so again, liberally.There's an early scene in which predecessors of the Ku Klux Klan hunt down Jamie Foxx, the freed slave and 'black man on a horse!' who is bounty hunting with ex Dentist, Dr King Schultz (played entirely idiosyncratically by Christoph Waltz), their depiction is so funny that one has to question whether or not it's really acceptable to laugh so uproariously at a subject matter so taboo; but that's Tarantino's gift. It's also his gift to spoof genres, mock convention (and history) mount lavish killing sprees and generally have a grand old time no matter the subject matter and that's why we love him so.Django is great fun, some say it's too long but for me the movie simply got itself into a place (a little slowly I'd say) that fans of Tarantino would want to stay for hours.Leonardo Di Caprio has not been this good since The Departed, (strangely not an Oscar nomination) and Jamie Foxx acquits himself well in a low-key, black Eastwood type performance. But it's Waltz that dominates in the acting stakes and his Oscar nod is fair reward. There's only one Chrisoph Waltz that's for sure (and there's plenty of it if you care to look – 101 acting roles to date to be precise.) So, a little flawed (the start fails to quickly engage in gear) but unique and brilliant. Go see it and forget the politics. It's a movie.",9,1,3,28 January 2013
Get Out," Claims to be a 'horror' but it's so much more than that.
","Once in a while a movie comes along that takes a genre by the scruff of the neck and vigorously shakes it into a new shape.This is so with Get Out, a horror movie (so the marketing blurb says) that lobs a few horror tropes into a lean and mean 104 minute thriller. But it is really a social observation on the insidiousness of racism. It comes out the other end as a unique movie offering.It borrows from Pacific Heights, Psycho, Michael Haneke's astonishing Party Games and sub-horror-porn like Saw without ever being any of them.Without resorting to spoilers its one gigantic twist from start to finish that realises the fears of a young black American guy on a trip to the country to meet his wealthy WASP girlfriend's family on a celebration weekend. Every sentence uttered by every character becomes a retrospective clue as to what the outcome will be.Given it's described as a 'horror' you can expect a deal of nasty stuff in a climactic ending. What director and screenwriter Jordan Peele (amazingly a debut outing) most cleverly does is apply Hitchcockian tension so that 89 minutes of tension are realised in a mere 15 minutes of terror in such a way that the nasty bits don't (as so often is the case) outstay their welcome.Superb performances all round from the five principal actors, but especially boyfriend and girlfriend Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams (Girls).It's should be no surprise that this has been both BAFTA and Golden Globes nominated, but it is because this genre rarely reaches this level of critical acclaim.It'll get Oscar nods too.",9,40,83,12 January 2018
Drive," Ultra violence with exquisite style.
","I've managed to miss every single one of director Nicolas Winding Refn's previous movies (Bronson being perhaps the best known) and typically his scores are mediocre on IMDb, which suggests his perchance for violence (he cites Texas Chainsaw Massacre as an influence) has divided his audiences to date.Not so in this one.At the time of writing Drive is recording a whopping 8.4 on the movie bible score meter.And with justice.Refn now sports a Cannes Best Director gong on his mantlepiece and it feels justified because this movie has been crafted to within an inch of its life. This is a real director's labour of love; from The Michael Mannesque, super saturated, ultra crisp LA at night cinematography to the uber mannered acting, fantastic casting, sparse as Ebeneezer Scrooge's pantry script (he wrote it) and ASTONISHING soundtrack (surely the Oscar winner already ).It's languid, propped up be very little dialogue but driven by the aforementioned score that oozes class, from the opening and closing songs to the underscore by Cliff Martinez that builds tension relentlessly. It's a tribute to the 80's with echoes of Moroder, Kraftwerk, Eno, early Human League and more recently My Bloody Valentine and Mogwai. Astounding. That gets a straight ten in my book.But of course that's not what everyone's talking about.They're talking about Ryan Gosling as the unnamed, unblinking, unflinching eponymous driver.Ryan Gosling is amazing in this movie and while there are brilliant supporting roles from the touchingly understated Carey Mulligan as the love interest, Albert Brooks (nasty as the lead baddie with a tiny little bit of a heart) and Ron Perlman (neanderthal, wicket, compelling...gorgeous in a way) it's Gosling all the way. The performance of his career surely (great as he was in Blue Valentine, and I've not seen him in the much lauded Ides of March yet, but I will) he commands the screen with not a blink of his eye from start till end, well actually at the end there is a wee blink. This is a tour de force performance and I loved it.The violence is excellent. Slow to come to the boil but shocking and visceral upon arrival.The driving is not overdone. Chase movies (except Ronan) are so tedious.The love story is well developed but never gets in the way.And the moral? Heroes come in all shapes and forms because this is surely a hero movie wrapped up in a complex web of antiheroes.Very strongly recommended. 8.5 out of 10.",8,2,5,5 October 2011
Room," So brilliantly conceived and performed it's almost as if you were viewing a documentary.
","Emma Donoghue's novel, inspired no doubt by the likes of the Josef Fritzl case in Austria, 2008, has been rewritten by the author herself for the screen. It's a mighty challenging undertaking and benefits to some degree by not being 'based on a true story' even if the inspiration was so obviously horrifically apparent.It tells the tale of a young mother, credited as 'Ma' but actually known as Joy (how ironic) played to Oscar winning standard by Brie Larson and her five year old son, Jack, who was born in captivity some time after Joy was absconded by a man entrapping her with the aid of a sick puppy.Thus begins Joy's nightmare. At some point Jack is conceived at the hands of her rapist jailer, Old Nick, played by Sean Bridgers. (It's a casting that may have given him some personal nightmares because he's not what you could describe as a sympathetic character). It's fair to say that although Ma tolerates Nick's visitations, she has to to protect her child and to be fed, no Stockholm Syndrome has developed.The movie begins on or around Jack's fifth birthday. Jack has never left the room in which he was conceived and into which he entered his insular world. He knows no place other than this, has never experienced any weather (or air even), never played with other children, never been admonished for fear of upsetting a very delicate ecology between him, his mother and the 'room' where they live.Aside from the nightly visitations of Old Nick for the daily rape of his mother he knows no other human being.Ma and Jack have a TV, so Jack has a perverse awareness of the 'world' but it's seen through juddering images and is as real to him as martians are to you and I.But somehow Ma and Jack soldier on.We catch them at the end of Ma's tether. After five years of protecting Jack from the fact that they live in a parallel existence she's decided it's time for the facts of life and so begins a plan to escape. You'll have seen the trailers so you'll know that ultimately the escape bid is successful and so begins the painful psychological process of leaving an almost feral yet totally sheltered existence into a world that's overwhelming.Relationships in the family have moved on in the years since Joy's disappearance. Mum and Dad, although both still alive cope in very different ways. The media go mad for the story, Joy finds the whole thing extremely difficult to cope with and we spend a very moving hour or so watching them come to terms with an existence that's completely alien to Jack and totally overwhelming for Joy. This is a life affirming movie. It's directed with great skill and sensitivity by Lenny Abrahamson and in Brie Larson and five year old Jacob Tremblay we can pretty much believe that this is not fiction but very real reality.A remarkable film that deserves all the awards that are about to come its way.Deep respect.",9,6,13,24 January 2016
I Am Legend," Wear brown trousers
","This kind of film is what going to the flicks is all about. I was scared witless from the first moment to the last. Admittedly I hadn't realised it was a zombie movie (of sorts) before the titles rolled and it was a good 40 minutes before we even came across one, but Jeez, this is a film designed to make you jump. I won't spoil it but, as they say, wear brown trousers.I know zombie flicks are overdone of late. But that's not a reason to overlook this freak-show.Will Smith is in fine form, essentially carrying the movie singlehandedly with very little human intervention. That's because we understand him to be the last man standing after a genetically treated measles virus which was intended to eradicate the world of cancer went ugly overnight.The scenes that have most redolence in this movie are the truly stunning and really eerie street scenes of an abandoned New York populated only by escaped zoo animals who aren't that handy with lawnmowers, the result being that, for example, Madison Avenue is well on its way to becoming a maize field with a bunch of abandoned, rusting cars lying around. Whole buildings are wrapped in polythyene, presumably a failed attempt to contain the virus in some way.Smith looks great, acts pretty well and builds up a strong relationship with his only companion, his three year old Alsation, Sam.The film is lavish. The sound engineering is both deafening and a major component to most of the shocks.The zombies, while CGI'd at times, are genuinely creepy. They cannot come out in daylight as UV burns them on the spot so they huddle, vampire like, in 'hives' in gloomy dilapidated buildings waiting for nightfall when they take over the streets with their ghoulish hounds.In one set piece when we KNOW Will shouldn't go into a darkened building the tension is unbearable and more drawn out than a Strictly Come Dancing result. You KNOW it will culminate in a massive fright and it does, but that doesn't stop it being eye-wateringly scary.This is a cracker and my first 8 out of 10 movie of 2008.Go see.",8,1,3,4 January 2008
A Quiet Place," Instant Horror Classic.
","This horror film works extremely powerfully on a number of levels.It perfectly demonstrates Hitchcock's thinking 'There is a distinct difference between 'suspense' and surprise', and yet many pictures continually confuse the two. - if filmmakers keep spectators unaware, they can create 'fifteen seconds of surprise,' but if they inform them of the impending encounter, they can produce 'fifteen minutes of suspense'In A Quiet Place director (and co-star) John Krasinski (who directed three episodes of The Office - not exactly a training ground for this) has clearly listened to Hitchcock because everything about this superb movie is driven by suspense. I counted ten times when I leaped from my seat, but I was on the edge of it from start to finish.It's lean, taut, beautifully shot, expertly sound-tracked and superbly sound-crafted (absolutely essential in a movie that's about noise).His acting, and that of his entire family (particularly the outstanding Emily Blunt - his real life wife), is razor sharp.And the whole thing is done and dusted in a credible 80 minutes flat.Bish, bash, bosh. Job done.Scared the crap out of you.Now, go home.Really, this is film craft at its finest and a straight into my top ten horrors of all time alongside...The Shining
It Follows
Get Out
Alien
Jaws
Psycho
The Exorcist
Rec
Paranormal Activity
What brings these all together (with the exception of The Shining and possibly Rec) is the lack of REAL horror.Less, in my book, is generally more.What makes this movie so damned good is the relationship Krasinski builds between members of the family. His willingness to dispose of lead characters with a minimum of fuss makes the whole much more believable and credible and the fact that the story treats its audience with respect. It has a strong beginning, middle and end although we join the story some 89 days into its telling.The visual clues are subtle. The emotions real, small and detailed.He makes few plot mistakes (although the 'nail' set up is a little contrived and 'the spaceship' has a pretty big 'guess what's coming' flag attached to it).The gore is minimal which is how I like it.Now, look at that list above and you can see a golden age of horror emerging: A Quiet Place, Get Out, It Follows, Rec and, just missing the list, French horror , Raw, are all pretty recent. They are all minimalist but they are all a) brilliantly directed and b) finely acted. The craft skills are evident in abundance in all three, but none of them need a lot of gore to engage their audience.I hope Krasinski gets his just rewards for this.",10,4,7,18 April 2018

Kick-Ass," Kick Ass by name and by nature.
","Kick Ass starts from a promising point of view.What if anyone could take to the streets and exact protection or retribution in the role commonly associated with superheroes? Hmmm.

It's a Smorgasbrod of superheroes from Dark Knight-esquire Batman (in 11 year old girl's clothes humming along to a Tarantino soundtrack) to a young Steve Martin in The Jerk-like loser role.And that's what makes this film ROCK. It really does. Its bad language is at times shriek out loud funny. 'Is that all you C**** have got?' yells 11 year old Hit Girl as she pumps lead into more brains than an episode of University Challenge.'Take that you Mother F******.' When she gets angry.Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) is the movie-stealing find of the decade. She is gobsmackingly in your face as she DESTROYS hundreds of armed thugs (think O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill, or even better her teenage sidekick Gogo Yubari).It's completely out of order, off the scale, outrageous and freakin' hilarious.Nicolas Cage is great as a scheming and revenging madman. The scene where he practices firing pump action bullets into Hit Girl's chest is unique and remarkable.This is a great movie.

The Hurt Locker," Iraq. futile but a blast for some, literally.
","noun. A figurative place where someone is said to be or will be, if they are getting or expect to be getting hurt or beaten.You may not agree with the politics behind the invasion of Iraq (I certainly didn't support its invasion and will, forever, despise Tony Bliar (sic) for his misleading of the parliament) but whatever your stance one must surely support the troops that operate there.This film takes a rather too pro-American stance in that it positions most Iraquis as 'the enemy' in a fairy broadbrush way. But that is about its only flaw, and if you can overlook that we are talking epic war movies here.The film draws you in from the get go as we follow the episodic adventures of a team of bomb disposal experts filmed (documentary style) on the streets of an unnamed Iraqui city.The insurgents will go to any extremes (hence why they're known as extremists I guess) to ply their dirty trade, most gut-wrenchingly by creating a human bomb out of a murdered 10 year old boy (maybe it should have been called a cadaver bomb).It's pretty much a three man performance but the acting plaudits go principally to Jeremy Renner, a died in the wool adrenalin freak, and his more considered colleague, played by Anthony Mackie. I am not familiar with either of their work previously but both deliver measured and moving performances.The central axis of the film is around Renner's character SSgt William James who has defused over 800 bombs and approaches the task with a bravado that terrifies his more conservative colleagues. (In fact the movie's opening line essentially captures his ethos; 'The rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.' )But he always gets the job done in the most difficult situations. He's positioned as a cold and callous redneck but, as often in these movies, the cracks begin to show and an entirely more human soldier emerges which revolves around his relationship with a cheeky young Iraqui market trader (perhaps the only sympathetic Iraqui character in the movie). This ends with a delicious twist that I'll not spoil here.There is no question that Bigelow deserves her place at the top table come Oscar time and might even win. It would be amusing to see her put one over on ex-husband James Cameron who is probably also in the running for Avatar.This is a grown up movie with a really powerful hit. It powerfully captures the emotion of war and sense of place that few war movies do (Thin Red Line by Terence Malik being an exception as well as the excellent made for TV movie, Occupation, made earlier this year with James Nesbitt; and also set in Iraq).A big fat 9 out of 10 from me.",9,14,22,30 December 2009

That is one thing this intelligent movie proves.It's not just from the pen, it's now from the eye, of Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later scriptwriter) as he makes an impressive directorial debut.The story is about Caleb, a star employee of Google (not exactly hidden), who wins a week's stay at the owner's secluded mansion in the country to work on a secret project. This turns out to be the latest iteration in Oscar Isaac's (Google boss) quest to create the perfect AI robot. Caleb's role in all this is to perform a Turing test on the robot (The Turing Test is when a machine attempts to fool a human being into thinking it is human). This is helped by the fact that the robot in question is the dazzlingly beautiful Ava, played by Alicia Vikander. Her screen presence, often shorn of hair, is electrifying throughout. Naturally the test escalates as Ava appears to seduce Caleb (and who can blame him for falling for her allure).The film asks us to consider whether artificial intelligence can rise above the purely mechanistic and create genuine emotion and human thinking, doing so in rich, but sterile, surroundings. Is Nathan (the boss) playing God and can Caleb (probably a deliberately biblical sounding name) stop what may be one step too far for humankind?And if Ava really is capable of human thinking can she outwit the experiment and establish authority of her own. All is revealed.Much has been made of the film's title - that it is a meaningless construct - but it seems fairly obvious to me.Can the machine (Ava) become an ex-machine?",7,2,14,6 March 2015
1917," This is Roger Deakins' finest achievement in cinematography.
","I have a recurring dream.It's a common one.In it I am a soldier trying to evade the grasp of my enemy in a war zone. I sneak around fields, towns, villages often being spotted, running for my life. Sometimes I spot the enemy from afar preparing to attack and a sense of dread overwhelms me. It last all night.The dream interpreters, not particularly surprisingly, suggest this reflects some form of conflict one are facing in one's life.Today, in the cinema I witnessed that dream come to life, imagined by Sam Mendes in a Hades like no other.It's terrifying.Totally and utterly terrifying.It's a true story based on the experience of Mendes' grandfather, Alfred, who shared a fragment of what happened with his grandson.Mendes' career is largely theatre-based, and many film critics believe theatre makers do not make good film makers. Yes, they might be strong on dialogue and characterisation but they tend to be weaker on cinematography.One way to resolve this is to create your movies with Roger Deakins, surely the greatest cinematographer in history - given not only his ridiculously great eye but also the technology he has to further enhance his art.There can be NO doubt that this is as much Deakins' movie as it is Mendes'. He was Oscar nominated 12 times before he finally landed one for Bladerunner 2049 (along the way his greatness has blessed No Country for Old Men, Skyfall, The Shawshank Redemption, Faro and The Assasination of Jesse James...). This will be his second. There can be no doubt about that.The combination of stunning grading, extremely long takes and unworkeoutable steadycam technique defies logic, description and understanding. It is mesmerising.Remember the first 20 minutes of Speilberg's Saving Private Ryan, arguably the greatest War movie of all time? Would you agree with me that the remaining 90 minutes is patchy at best? Well, 1917 begins more slowly, but no less electrifyingly, as we settle into Deakins' art. The difference though is that the remaining 90 minutes of 1917 grab you by the throat and do not let off.It's completely overwhelming.Technical movies of this competence don't always have great acting performances. And this won't win George Mackay an Oscar, probably not even a nomination, but he does not let the side down, neither does his supporting actor Dean-Charles Chapman, but although this is SUCH a human story it's the sheer scale and bravado of the overall thing that is what makes it such a compelling piece of filmmaking.Some will lament the fact that this is so, but I believe Mendes has found the balance.One other thing Thomas Newman's soundtrack is so gripping, so menacing that jeopardy is maintained for it's entirety, it's a significant achievement.He has created a nightmare vision that out-horrors even the likes of The Exorcist, because this is no fantasy, this is reality, and it feels like it.Truly a seminal cinema experience. This will only be half the movie on your TV set so get up and get down to your local big screen, before it's too late.Peerless.The movie of the year (although I've yet to see Parasite) in an already epic year.",10,0,2,12 January 2020
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Subtle and very rewarding
","In true Bergmanesque fashion this languid Swedish gem of a movie starts slowly and gradually speeds up to walking pace. But let that not put you off. It's an understated little gem of a thriller that gradually unfolds with a complex and multi-layered story that is packed full of repressed sexual abuse messages.At its core a political activist and writer (Michael Niqvist playing Michael Blomqvist) is hired by an industrialist to solve the 40 year old mystery around the disappearance of a slightly loopy teenage girl. Running simultaneously is the back story of a young super hacker (Lisbeth played by Noomi Rapace). Although a lesbian she gradually falls for, 30 years her senior, Blomqvist.Everything about this movie is subtle, even the fact that at no point in the movie is there any reference to its title, other than in one beautifully shot scene and even then it's almost incidental. The chemistry between Lisbeth and Blomqvist is so delicate you think it will shatter at any second, instead it grows millimetre by millimetre into a great double act. For that one has to applaud director Neils Adren Oplev whose work is unfamiliar to me.It's to be released next year as a Hollywood remake with Daniel Craig replacing Blomqvist in the male lead role but bravely, the studio has stuck with the beguiling Rapace in the title role and =as it's to be directed by Michael Fincher we can expect good things because at the core lies a brilliant story that has been brilliantly written. (in fact in many ways this movie reminded me - albeit in a much lower key way - of Se7en.) It centres around abuse of all kinds, fundamentally sexual, but also racial and religious all wrapped together in a neat package that carries a strong moral and emotional punch and the good news is that the other two books in this series have also been filmed by the same team and are due for release BEFORE Hollywood enters the fray.It's out on DVD now but please choose to watch it the way it was intended. In Swedish with subtitles, not the coward's way out (overdubbed in English).",9,3,7,22 August 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Unexpected tension and greatness
","I wasn't overly optimistic about this movie. Having set out on a 'see all the Oscar nominated 'best movies' before the Oscars weekend'(tricky in the UK as they often come out AFTER the awards) my wife and I picked up Crash (truly appalling and heavy handed scriptwriting)and Munich (good, not great, also with a touch of overt politicking) along with Good night, in the last 24 hours.We saw Brokeback a few weeks ago and, it too, has a central politic; in this case, the freedom to ride bareback with your cowboy mates - it is far less political but disappointing in several ways.Good night and good luck was my least anticipated of them all, (I have to say the trailers were, at best, dry) but it is, by a significant margin, the best movie of this bunch (time will tell if Capote is in my running as it's not out yet in the UK).As the most overtly political movie of them all Good Night succeeds mainly by not banging the political drum which it has every right to. The performance of David Strathairn is utterly spellbinding (sorry Joaquim, but you've been beaten for best actor despite your wonderful Johnny Cash tribute).George Clooney is an able sidekick (in a slightly George Clooney way) but his direction is phenomenally restrained, the art direction and cinematography utterly convincing, not least for the way the stock footage is woven in so effortlessly, and the script really tight.Obviously McCarthy was ripe for a good doing over but he is almost treated with respect. For me the way Clooney resists the temptation marks him out as a much more sophisticated director (and scriptwriter) than most, especially the frankly embarrassing Haggis(Crash) and yet Haggis seems to be getting great reviews for portraying the race issue in LA with all the subtlety of The Simpsons.Good Night is as tense as any thriller I've seen recently (and that includes the excellent 'Hidden'). The cast as good an ensemble as you'd like and the musical interludes outstanding too. It looks, sounds and feels like a world where standing up for something was worth doing.If I were an Academy voter Good Night... would clean up.",9,3,5,18 February 2006
The Imitation Game," The day Cumberbatch came of age.
","The British Government essentially killed Alan Turing.The man who invented what we now consider the 'computer' and he may have saved 14 million people from death because of his contribution, sorry vast contribution, to the foreshortening of the Second World War through his invention of the Enigma code breaking machine. Churchill thought so.But, the trouble is, you see, Alan Turing was a homosexual. And the British Government (like many today did not like homosexuals). Homosexuals in the post war years were lepers of society. So the British Government chemically castrated him.Alan Turing was most likely also a sufferer of Aspergers Syndrome.He was, in every sense of the word, a genius.He was not a likable man because to make real, substantial change sometimes eschews popularity. He was not popular.It's a dream role for an actor of substance. That actor is Benedict Cumberbatch.At the time of writing Cumberbatch has seven movies in production, new episodes of the BBC's Sherlock and a couple of episodes of The Hollow Crown as Richard III as work in progress. It would seem reasonable to assume from this that he is a man in demand.Why?Because he is a brilliant actor. And this is his time. This is most certainly his movie. Yes, he has good support from Keira Knightley, Allen Leech, Matthew Goode and especially Mark Strong, as his 'boss'. Charles Dance moves on from his movie idol roles into the baddie spotlight and carries it off effortlessly. But make no mistake. This is ALL about Benedict Cumberbatch.Biopics are often easy meat because they can be imitation games.But who knew Turing?In Cumberbatch's hands he's a clean sheet and as the movie develops he progresses from a no name to an absolute hero.Who cares about Alan Turing? At the start; maybe only the informed. By the end; we all do. It builds to a highly emotional climax that is handled with great skill by breaking Norwegian director Morgan Tyldum. You probably don't know his work. I don't I'm afraid; but I'm keen to.This is great cinema. Please go see it.",8,6,11,18 November 2014
Jurassic World," Jurassic World: Thomas Hardy Reimagined for the 23rd century.
","Let's face it, this is basically just Far From the Madding Crowd with dinosaurs instead of sheep.Think about it. A strong-willed female lead (Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire) heads of to farm in a far off land (a Costa Rican Island Colony) where she initially spurns her first love (the modern shepherd; Chris Pratt as Owen).Then it all goes totally Pete Tong when the sheep (sorry dinosaurs) get a taste for forbidden fruit (hay rigs and barns may not go on fire but everything else does) before spurned lover Owen comes back to save the day. They appear to be about to live happily ever after but their love is not consummated on screen. That Ladies and gentlemen is the story of Far From the Madding Crowd; and of Jurassic World.But it's so much more than this of course. A hilarious romp with many in jokes and nods to the original (Jurassic Park), a brilliant script from Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (and it really is a good script with lots of laugh out loud moments), more than passable central performances and a shed load of brilliant effects with a bunch of real good suspense thrown in.Frankly, it's great.Baaaa.",7,7,21,7 July 2015
Paranormal Activity," Not as good as it's made out to be but fresh and totally original
","OK. A lot has been said about how terrifying this movie is. In truth it is a little slow and does have a number of really scary bits. But it is blown out of proportion. I would tell you more but don't want to spoil it. I took my daughters Amy (18) and Ria (15) and they were both pretty freaked out and hanging onto me for dear life but it's not half as scary as Drag Me to Hell.The lack of ANY credits whatsoever is brilliant though. And very unnerving.Despite the lack of truly scariness I thought it was a very interesting and original movie and brilliantly acted and cast. These appeared to be, like, real people (gasp).I'd recommend it despite those reservation. 7/10.",7,1,2,29 November 2009
Cold War," Completely engrossing and stunningly beautiful. An arthouse masterpiece.
","The first thing to state about this beautiful movie is that it's monochrome. So stunningly so that at times you feel you are in a photographic gallery rather than a cinema. The quality of the cinematography is quite extraordinary thanks to Lucas Zal.It's also in 4:3 format. Not the square format of Instagram, but close.We don't see 4:3 very often these days but Wes Anderson used it to immense effect in Grand Budapest Hotel and so did Lazslo Melis in Son of Saul.It's an engaging format that draws you in. It suggests a time before cinemascope (16:9 etc) and only really works in period cinema of a time. This time. But it also lends itself to incredible framing, such as when our female protagonist floats down a river gradually disappearing out of shot, and later in the movie when the chief protagonists leave a bus and walk out of frame in a composition that Henri Cartier Breson would be proud of.It's one of the most beautiful movies I've seen in many years.In truth that's probably its biggest strength.It is, but it isn't really, narrative driven. More episodic than story driven but it does tell a tale about director Pawel Pawlikowski's parents' love affair set against the Cold War backdrop in his native Poland.It's fairly sordid in a way (his mother was abused by her father as a child) but without anything shocking to see.Imagine, yes.The two leads ( Joanna Kulig and Tomasz Kot) are magnificent. Brooding, beautiful (although unconventionally so) and real.Lucas Zal has a great time dwelling on three particular things. Crowd shots. Amazing, Dance sequences. Amazing. Joanna Kulig (the lead). Amazing.In particular, Joanna Kulig has a stand out performance. She's not one to show her enjoyment in life. Sullen most would say. But it is an immense performance.It's a love story, set against the challenges that Cold War Poland put in front of people of artistic belief where communist doctrine made creativity very difficult.What Pawel Pawlikowski achieves is a mood piece of exemplary, peerless really, detail.And it's a musical. I was constantly drawn to comparing it to La La Land, yet it is so NOT La La Land. Partly it's down to Kulig who shares the unorthodox looks (beauty) of Emma Stone. Partly it's the framing of Zal.And the music fuses from Polish country folk to French basement jazz (which La La Land would have been so comfortable with).This is an Oscar nomination shoe in. It's absolutely brilliant.And, at 88 minutes, certainly does not outstay its welcome.Bravo!A Straight 10 from me.",10,119,175,4 September 2018
Silence," Martin Scorsese's brilliant religious polemic. Is religion good for the human race? You'll need to see it to decide. Vital for our times.
","To follow up The Wolf of Wall Street with this movie demonstrates that no director has the sheer vision and chutzpah of Martin Scorsese. We are talking chalk and cheese in extremis here. Not even P.T. Anderson or Alejandro Iñárritu can match his range.As each movie goes by he lays greater and greater claims to be the greatest movie director of all time.But Silence will not be, by any means, top of the popularity list.Because this is film making borne of extreme passion (clearly the source novel connected with him).This is a cinematic therapy session, a philosophical 15 rounder and languid, art-house fare that few will love.It's a beast of a movie, weighing in at 2 hours and 41 minutes. There is no action. No soundtrack (music) to speak of. No sex. In fact hardly any women.And it's about the tension of religious powerbroking in 17th century Japan.For many reviewers I've read (and my wife's view) it's just plain boring. And I can understand, but don't agree with, where they are coming from. It is incredibly slow.Scorsese's lifelong editor, the mighty Thelma Schoonmacker, has either been over-ruled in many places or is complicit in its sheer lack of pace. Certainly it could be cut in places where some repetition is evident and probably unnecessary. That said, its pace is its schtick.The central premise about religion being the root of all the shoot the world had to deal with then, and has to deal with now, is highly topical and that's what makes it an essential movie of our times.It even-handedly plays out the battle between Buddhism and Khiristianity (sic) and leaves the viewer to decide if religion is the root of all evil or that some religions have more merit than others. Given Scorsese's Catholic upbringing this is an impressive feat. I know not whether he remains a believer or an abstainer, but either way this could have made for an overplayed hand either for or against Christianity. The fact that the movie is neither is to his huge credit and gives it it's real moral backbone.It's roundly well performed, the cinematography has a lot of merit and the overall production values are excellent.But this is not entertainment as such; this is a slog. A reason to appreciate cinema. It's notable that StudioCanal is behind it. Surely the greatest contributor in recent times to art-house cinema.There are no laughs in this. None AT ALL. But it is a venerable movie. And I loved it on many levels.And put it this way, it sparked a pretty intense post movie debate about the merits of religion then and now.",8,5,11,2 January 2017
Logan," For a non superhero movie fan this was quality fare.
","In which I see my first X-Men movie in a franchise that is now 10 episodes old. So I know nothing of the back story.I also have no real fondness for Hugh Jackman after the disaster that is Les Miserables.And I don't much like superhero movies full stop, unless they have a twist.So, that's what made this an excellent evening's entertainment. The twist.It's no spoiler to reveal that the twist is Wolverine (Jackman) is losing his powers. He's an OAS (Old Age Superhero) and, as such, it doesn't take much for his superpowers to run out long before the Duracell Bunny would like.And that opens up a depth of story line that is seldom seen in these franchise affairs.It requires, and is given, a quality script and a complexity of performance that makes it both engaging and sustaining throughout.It won't be my movie of the year by a long shot (and it fails to breathe the sort of life into an old vein that Mad Max Fury Road did two years ago) but it's an excellent evening's entertainment and I'd recommend it.",7,1,5,23 March 2017
Hotel Mumbai," Solid and unemotional retelling of a true life horror story. Well judged and well made.
","This Sky Original movie simultaneously released in theatres and on Sky and we watched it on its opening night, free from either having read reviews or expectations.To be honest, the real life incident that spawned the movie had actually faded in my memory so common, now, are such mass-murder terrorist events.That didn't really matter though, because whether or not one is familiar with this event, there are plenty others that it might have been.It's an ensemble cast production with stand-out, but un-showy, performances from Armie Hammer, Dev Patel and the head chef, played beautifully by Rohan Mirchandaney - all are trapped in the high class Taj Hotel in Mumbai as it is laid siege to by a group of Islamic terrorists acting under instruction from an off-screen telephone dictator known only as 'The Bull'.Whilst the terrorists enjoy a fair amount of screen time, it's their prey that the movie, rightly, focusses on rather than glorify the terrorists' actions.It's utterly chilling, pretty much from start to finish. The head count of close-range and strafing machine-gun deaths is colossal, brutal and completely emotionless. Indeed the film strangely fails to emotionally engage; rather it leaves you horror-struck at the ability of a less than elite bunch of assassins to wreak havoc, with little or no police/military intervention for many hours, making their killings become almost sporting-hunt-like.The story is peppered with crescendos of killing and then quieter periods where the prey take stock of their situation and gradually formulate plans for their escape.It's cat and mouse throughout and gripping in its intensity.I very much doubt this will trouble major awards juries, but as a piece of thought-provoking 'entertainment' it does its job without resorting to cliche, heavy emotional bribery or OTT special effects.A good job, well done.",7,2,16,29 September 2019
Singin' in the Rain," Frankly I am shocked...
","...that the good people of IMDb cannot give this monumental musical achievement a full blown ten out of ten.This movie is perfect.It is unquestionably the king of its genre.Unquestionably.Got that? Not the best film ever made, but the best by miles in its genre, And that deserves a 10.Not only that, it gave Morecombe and Wise their finest hour.It is rare indeed for musicals to be comic.Or is it a dance movie with songs? Who cares. It rocks.",10,3,8,31 May 2005
Alice in Wonderland," Good but not great. Less would have been more.
","First off. Go see the 2D version. The 3D adds nothing.Tim Burton is my favourite unpredictable director. Sweeney Todd and The Nightmare Before Christmas are both works of genius, but most of the rest have deep flaws. Alice in Wonderland is nearer the former than the latter (although my fellow viewers erred towards the latter).Tim has thrown the kitchen sink at this one. The effects (putting aside the 3D) are at times jaw dropping and some of his little vignettes are a delight (the Red Queen's guilty frogs in particular). And Mrs Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, can surely never have been better in a completely show-stealing role. She is hilarious.But it's too long and it's overloaded with ideas to the point that it begins to wash over you.I like Johnny Depp in this, but my wife didn't. He's mad. But then, he plays a mad hatter.7/10.",7,0,3,27 March 2010
Avatar," Masterpiece, except for the metaphors.
","I've been pondering this before putting proverbial pen to paper. it has some of the most ludicrously overblown and cheesy central metaphors in the history of cinema. the existence of God, The destruction of the amazonian rain forest, the overthrowing of native American Indians, colonialism, interracial relationships, gene cloning and stem cell scientific potential for abuse, good versus evil, the folly of war, the unfair use of 'shock and awe'...shall I go on? And yet, and yet...And yet this is a wonderful and deeply involving, even affecting movie. Why? Because James Cameron has invested his heart and soul into it. That much is very obvious. And this comes across as one man's lifetime obsession. It's like Coppola's Heart of Darkness (Apocalypse Now) in outer space.It opens like a scene from one of Cameron's great early movies (Aliens - with a set that compares) and the sight of Sigourney Weaver climbing out of a Cryogenic Sleep pod. Clearly his own little Alfred Hitchcock moment, or a wee joke for us boring buffs.Technically this movie raises the bar like no other film since Star Wars. This is the iphone of the movie world. the 3D impact is quite simply mind-blowing. No men with long poles sticking them out of the screen into your face. Not a hissing Cobra to be seen. No, this is 'immersive' in that you feel you are being drawn into a layered experience where there appears to be multiple depths of field, but all in focus. The scenes where the 'Tree of Life's' spores fall through the air enveloping characters is really quite unique and beautiful.Then there's the world he creates. One just wonders where he started. The military stuff takes on Star Wars but doesn't overcomplicate. It throws in a dash of Bladerunner technology, but mostly it just bowls you over with its apparent functionality. Pandora, the other world that our characters are mining for 'unobtanium' (great cod scientific name), is endless in imagination and quite simply, paradise.The Avatars themselves, 10 foot high humanoids, are beautiful and beguiling and 100% believable.They really could be real.The acting is good enough. The script passable.But the denouement, which brings it all together in a localised War of the World's is breathtaking and so long and so absorbing that you just cannot believe this level of ingenuity would actually be possible.But, apparently, it is.It all hangs together in a way that makes this one of the most unforgettable trips to the cinema I have ever had. No, it's not art house, but who cares. It is just a thing of greatness. A testament to James Cameron. I would not grudge him the Oscar against his ex wife whose own action movie could hardly be any different.Methinks it is a straight shoot out between the two.(Michael Haneke is unlikely to get the look in he deserves.) A straight ten (despite the reservations).",10,1,3,9 January 2010
Drag Me to Hell," All Hail King Sam
","In 1981 I was fortunate enough to take a chance on a first time director's movie at The Edinburgh Film Festival. The subtlety of the movie's title - The Evil Dead - caught my eye and I was transfixed with terror as Sam Raimi treated us to a low budget classic. Of course time has passed and Raimi has climbed the Hollywood ladder and now directs Spiderman. So I was delighted to find that he was back in the horror genre, this time with a big budget, but an unknown cast. and a great title...Drag me to Hell.I took my 14 year old daughter Ria along to see it, on her request, having warned her that it was no ordinary scary movie. That it was the real deal.'Jesus Christ.' she shrieked about 15 times as jump after jump assailed us.The publicity says this; 'Christine Brown has a good job, a great boyfriend, and a bright future. But in three days, she's going to hell.' It's a comment on our times. The first Credit Crunch horror movie and a lesson that if you mess with gypsy women over their mortgages you'll get what you deserve in return.Sam Raimi makes sublime horror movies. He's taken on board Hitchcock's theory that 20 minutes of suspense are worth 20 seconds of horror but he condenses this. You get many, many more shocks per square yard with Raimi than you ever did with Hitchcock and yet he never overdoes them. But they come at you in wave after wave. And the humour is brilliant. He really likes a bit of sicko stuff along the way and makes the most of this.Blood, snot, vomit, embalming fluid, they all get a run for their money. We see popped eyeballs, stapled eyeballs, flies entering orifices you wouldn't want flies in if it was you, limbs eaten whole, animals killed and mutilated. We get fleeting shadows, whispers, banging doors, flashbacks, mysterious winds and subliminal framing.We get NOISE. This film is so loud that even my mother could hear it.Every single trick in the horror (and comedy horror) book is used. Is it clichéd? Not a bit of it.An instant classic that climaxes perfectly. (Maybe it could even win Oscars?) 10 out of 10. Perfection.",10,0,4,8 June 2009
The Artist," A thoroughly engaging and unique (these days) cinematic experience.
","It's been a long wait for this much heralded movie, the notices from Cannes were enthusiastic to say the least and early user reviews on IMDb have anointed it with must see status.So, I went along today with an open mind and a hope that it justified its early 8.5 rating on our esteemed website. I have to say that it doesn't; but there is much to love in this delightful movie novelty.First off, this is a novelty. Once you've enjoyed its fare you are left wondering 'what exactly was the point of making that' because it has no real 'agenda'. I saw no political, religious or cultural allegory. What I saw was a lovingly crafted, beautifully photographic, gorgeously scored, excellently acted, art-house homage.It's kind of a big idea but without an idea, instead it's a film built around executional excellence and in that respect is often near to perfection with some lovely retro cinematographic and illusions.There's a particularly nice touch when Peppy Miller's movie opens in a cinema called the Reine (an in joke and nod to the production company that made it, La Petite Reine I suspect).I didn't know the story before I saw it and I won't spoil it for you here because the story is fairly slight and not that big a deal, it's merely the skeleton for a series of set pieces and fun.It's held together principally by the delightful Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), an up and coming 'talkies ' star who worships the ground that fallen idol George Valentin (surely a nod to Valentino) played brilliantly by Jean Dujardin walks on. However many scenes are stolen by the delightful Jack Russell terrier who is Valentin's only constant soul mate throughout the movie.There are also two good cameos from American actors John Goodman, as the studio magnate, and James Cromwell, who you've seen literally hundreds of times without perhaps realising who he is, as Valentin's loyal manservant.It's shot in a, 1.37: 1 ratio that these days, is virtually unseen, but was the format of choice in the 20′s. This, for me added further authenticity, as do the beautiful credits, captions and monochrome photography.Sound is used cleverly throughout and the final scene had me grinning from ear to ear.I really liked this oddball movie. No it's not one of the greatest ever made and I doubt will do much at The Oscars outside of the technical categories but it's a great hour and a half and an unusual and worthwhile feelgood movie experience.",7,1,2,11 January 2012
La La Land," La La Land. The greatest movie musical ever made? No spoilers I promise.
","A bold statement I admit, when you have to size it up against West Side Story and Singin' in the Rain. But from the first bar of Another Day of Sun - a huge Busby Berkeleyesque number - that erupts on the gridlocked freeways of LA you know you are actually in heaven.The two central characters, Mia and Sebastian, are introduced at its finale and we set off on a love story like no other. (Are there even any other actors in the film. I'll have to look next time. Oh yes. John Legend completely taking the Mickey out of himself. Tip your hat to him for that.) Well, it's like the Umbrellas of Cherbourg actually, but better, so so much better.There are only actually 7 songs in it. So it's quite an unmusical, musical. And neither Ryan Gosling nor Emma Stone can really properly sing. But that's beside the point.Writer and director Damian Chazelle (Whiplash - another magical movie about jazz) subverts the musical genre by having almost no music in the third and fourth acts. But it doesn't matter because now he has a story to tell. Emma Stone is nothing short of mesmerising. Those eyes. That cinematography. Those costumes.Ryan Gosling. A fault free cinema superstar. He rises eloquently and handsomely to the occasion.But even though they are both brilliant this is Damian Chazelle's movie. He has the mark of a master with his direction and storytelling.It even has tap dancing. I won't spoil it for you by sharing the full storyline as I knew nothing of it before I went to see it but I confess I was worried about the hype and the knowledge that the leads can't sing. There was no need to worry and you shouldn't either because this movie is about the unique vision of Damian Chazelle. He is clearly a scholar of big studio big budget musicals and has used the power of Whiplash's success to create a dream that no-one has been allowed to tamper with. It's a deconstruction and reconstruction of everything that makes great musicals great but with the twist outlined above.City of Stars has already picked up a Golden Globe, and rightly so, but it's not even the best song in the movie. It's difficult to go much further without spoilers so I'll leave it at that. Probably the best musical movie ever made. I led the applause and went to buy a ticket for the showing immediately after the one I'd seen but circumstances prevented me from watching it back to back. I'll have to wait until later this week when it opens properly.Put it this way I'm now extremely jealous of the 99% of the world's population who have yet to see La La Land and I beseech you to follow my actions.A straight 10/10. No question.",10,5,11,9 January 2017
Les Misérables," Awful. Turgid and mawkish. (Except for Anne Hathaway who is outstanding.)
","I've seen Les Mis twice on stage. It's too long. Fact. But I was interested in what would happen on screen and hoped that Tom Hooper's horribly fussy direction of the King's Speech would not follow him into this. I hoped but my wish was unfulfilled.Tom Hooper puts the blown into overblown in everything he does. The Damned United wasn't a patch on the book, The King's Speech is simply the most overrated movie of the past few years and this, well put it this way, if Anne Hathaway hadn't been in it I'd have been asking for my money back.Let's deal with the positives first (shouldn't take long). Anne Hathaway's performance as Fantine is mesmerising, especially in her death scene at the end of the first reel. It's a shame because the movie dies with her. And it's all the more remarkable that Hooper will have two Oscar winning performances under his belt from two lousy movies. As I said; remarkable.In places (Hathaway's death scene in particular) the hand held camera work with a LOT of focus pulling (necessary because of the narrow depth of field and low light works magically. It's incredibly intimate, yet at others it's just plain annoying (and repetitive).Next, the sound. I could hear every lyric from start to finish which meant that, unlike the stage play, it was easy to follow the (turgid and unlikely) story easily.But the sound is actually one of my biggest gripes. Yes it was brave, and in parts very good (Hathaway again) to make the actors perform the numbers for real but by focusing on clarity of audio the incidental sound had to be dropped with the result that almost the entire movie sounded like it had been recorded in a recording studio and consequently appeared entirely fake.Now the rest of the bad news.The sets are horrible. Entirely unconvincing from start to finish.Hugh Jackman is unbearable to watch (his singing voice is unlistenable).Russell Crowe is appalling, but not as bad as the double act that is Helena Bonham Carter (surely her worst performance ever) and Sacha Baron Cohen who just plain sucks.Eddie Redmayne left me totally cold but I'm sure the ladies will like his boyish good looks. But nah. He sucks too.The direction is mawkish in the extreme which makes the child parts nauseous and heavy handed.I could go on but I don't want to bore you and I know that nobody will like this review on IMDb because nobody likes critical reviews on IMDb. Ah well.",4,2,10,13 January 2013
The Shape of Water," Too many flaws for this ambitious piece to merit serious praise.
","The Faberge Egg: A thing of undoubted beauty, extremely costly but serving no real purpose.So it is with The Shape of Water.Constantly Guillermo del Toro leaves me disappointed. Pan's Labrynth especially and now this much hyped 'masterpiece'. Both miss the target by some distance for me. (I'll give you, he nailed it in both Cronos - a long time ago now - and Hellboy.)There's much to like about The Shape of Water (but NOT the music which is standard fare and I'm puzzled as to why it won the BAFTA). The design is superb, it really is a sumptuous feast both in period detail, cinematography and mood and the sets are great.Sally Hawkins is fine in the role of a mute who falls in love with a fishy 'monster' but why, oh why, does she need to get full frontal naked and masturbate in her bath in the opening scenes of the movie. Wholly gratuitous.Octavia Spencer puts in a decent shift in the supporting female role but, oh my gosh, this is not an Oscar-worthy performance. (Exactly the same can be said about the mystifying nomination for Mary J. Blige in Mudbound - I'll leave you to your own conclusions on why these were Academy nominated.)Both the male leads are on form; Michael Shannon as the nasty finder and torturer of the fish man and Richard Jenkins as Hawkins' neighbourly friend and the narrator; an alcoholic, cat-loving, adman fallen on hard times.My biggest criticism lies with the script, or more correctly, the plot which has holes the size of the budget (actually, on checking it was only $19.4m, so my Faberge analogy is stretched a little. Author's note: Faberge Eggs sell from around $6m to $33m.)OK it's a fantasy movie but it's pretty silly really and stretches credibility throughout.I wanted to like this, I really did and I don't dislike it, it's just so fundamentally flawed that its 13 Oscar nods verge on ludicrous. I don't think it will take home more than three (I wouldn't give it any with a possible exception for design) - Best Movie most certainly should not be one of them.",5,3,4,3 March 2018
The Disaster Artist," I think a little overrated and not sympathetic enough for my liking.
","The Disaster Artist is essentially a biopic of an episode in the life of the mysterious Tommy Wiseau, a failed actor who somehow managed to spend over $6m on making what some regard as the worst film in Hollywood history; The Room. (It scores 3.6 on IMDB for information.)I would urge you to at least watch some of the 'Best of The Room' videos that you can find on Youtube before seeing tThe Disaster Artist. Better still, go to a screening of the movie which has reached such levels of cult status and interactivity that it's become a bit like a Rocky Horror Picture Show screening or a Singalonga Sound of Music.I mean it's awful. The Room, that is.Here we find out how it came about and that means trying to get under the skin of Tommy Wiseau himself, clearly a task that James Franko has tackled with some relish, as he plays the lead role (and, like Wiseua directs the movie). His younger brother Dave Franko plays Wiseau's best friend Greg who plays Mark in the movie.It's outright weird in places as we try to get to grips with Wiseau's accent - at times he is virtually unintelligible (including in The Room final cut - one of its great charms). He claims to be from St Louis but he looks Chinese or certainly East Asian and sounds Hungarian or certainly Eastern European. It's a bizarre mash up that Franko nails from the off.Then there's the money, where does it come from? No clues are given. And his sexuality? His relationship with Greg is nothing if not close, but there is no sexual advances made on his 'baby faced' charge who he takes in to his home in LA.Seth Rogan has a supporting role as an exasperated Script Supervisor/stand in director when Tommy is on screen - one famous scene required 67 takes and is captured hilariously here.But it's all a little sad. Clearly we are laughing AT Wiseau not WITH him and it all felt a little charmless in that respect. There's no doubt Franko pulls it off and his brother also has a good turn, but for me I'd have liked just a spark of sympathy for the big fella.The movie has gone on to wash its face and Wiseau has milked it enthusiastically over the years - maybe a little more than a caption to that effect would have given Tommy the last laugh.",6,11,18,13 December 2017
The Departed," It's true. It really is one of Scorses's best
","This genuinely is a ten out of ten movie. No exaggeration. From the first frame to the last this screams Oscar at you. Best Actor (presumably Damon, but Di Caprio's role is just as awesome) best supporting actor for Nicholson (no question whatsoever) His rat scene rivals Anthony Hopkins' Fava beans for outrageousness. Best Director (goes without saying) Best movie, best editing for Thelma Shoomaker. Best adapted screenplay. The soundtrack's pretty cool too - even if the use of Comfortably Numb, which I predicted to myself quietly as the scene before it prompted (Was it Van Morrison covering?), was a bit corny.If there is a weakness it could be the love interest coincidence which I felt was a touch unlikely, but so what I'll forgive that.The swearing is as good as I've ever seen in a movie. Really, really great F****** swearing. Really great.The cast is universally magnificent and the scriptwriting is so real it's like...real.The (many) deaths are executed like you'd expect them to be in real life, no huge contorted death scenes, just wham bam you're dead.My jaw was on my chest for most of this movie. Scorses regains his best director in Hollywood title. Thank you Marty.",10,0,2,13 October 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," A monumental cinematic achievement.
","Jessica Chastain's performance as 'Agent' Maya is as restrained as Kathryn Bigelow's direction of one of the most monumental moments in detective and military history.It's so restrained (as is the direction) that one almost thinks it's for real.I honestly can't imagine how two men could have taken the story of UBL (Osama Bin Laden) being meticulously hunted down and killed and made it as restrained and yet still menacing as this absolute triumph of a movie. But Bigelow and Chastain do just that.Chastain, hard as nails, yet soft as silk, throughout, carries the movie with so much ease it's like she isn't actually acting. She is miraculous. But only because Bigelow affords her the space to breathe, the edit to breathe, the whole idea to breathe with such subtlety that it's almost as if there IS NO DIRECTOR.Is this documentary or drama? There's been much made about the depiction of torture (especially water-boarding) in the first reel that it sounded to me like I was about to embark on a torture-porn outing. Believe none of that. This is no torture porn movie. The only porn is what inspired it. Yes, the beginning is uncomfortable, but it is considered, restrained and important in the storytelling.For two hours this astonishing piece of film does next to nothing other than scratch away at the forensics of tracking down the most untrackable mass murderer in history before exploding into the dimmest lit, scariest half hour of action you'll see in any action movie. And you know the outcome. Weird.It IS a documentary really.Character development is minimal and storytelling is at best sketchy, off camera, challenging to the viewer (but that's what's so involving about it).It's pin drop territory - I don't think I've ever heard such a quiet cinema audience. Popcorn eating would have incited a riot in our multiplex.James Gandolfini makes his second cameo performance this year in an Oscar nominated movie (after Argo) and it shows that he is politically connected and wise of late career choice. Soon, perhaps, we'll see him in full-bodied, lead role political material.Two hours in, the first bars of music creep into the soundtrack. The effect is electrifying. It almost immediately disappears before re-emerging in the credits. It's that kinda film where music seems unimaginable, yet Alexandre Despal's contribution is vital.The final scene sees Chastain reflect on her achievement. Her tears were echoed by mine.A monumental achievement in cinema.",10,9,19,6 February 2013
Steve Jobs," Whilst Jobs is a little sugar-coated it's one of Boyle's career highlights and Fassbender and Winslett once again wow us.
","'The thing that struck me was his intensity. Whatever he was interested in he would generally carry to an irrational extreme. Jobs had honed his trick of using stares and silences to master other people. One of his numbers was to stare at the person he was talking to. He would stare into their ******* eyeballs, ask some question, and would want a response without the other person averting their eyes.'So said Walter Isaacson of Steve Jobs in his breathtaking biography.This, frankly scary, aspect of Steve Jobs' personality is heavily sugar-coated in Danny Boyle's excellent biopic and your requirement for absolute accuracy of detail could be the undoing of it for you, because you could drive a coach and horses through many of the structural, and representational, aspects of the film.Boyle presents Jobs in an extremely positive light and this is surely not to satisfy his Estate as Isaacson's Biog has already ripped him to pieces in personality terms. Kate Winslet's role as Joanna Hoffman, his right hand woman, seems hugely overblown compared to her real influence but she is a vital plot device.There are three of these. His relationship with Hoffman (Winslett in yet another Oscar nominatable performance); his relationship with the mother of his daughter (and his daughter Lisa) and the three product launch performances (legendary though they are you never actually see them - The Macintosh, The Next Computer and the iMac).Central to all of this is the underpinning and highly challenged relationship with his daughter Lisa whom we see grow from a wide eyed four year old to a somewhat embittered Freshman. Jobs comes out of this reasonably well as Danny Boyle positions his ex, Chrisann Brennan, as a needy somewhat whining gold-digger. It's highly debatable as to whether this is an accurate reflection of her. But it gives Fassbender (as Jobs) the ammunition to riff off and gradually respect the needs of his daughter whom he reluctantly builds an affection for.Steve Wosniak is played dead straight (and very well) by Seth Rogen and one of his stand up battles with Jobs, as he tries to get him to acknowledge the vital importance of the work of the engineers who build the business saving Apple II, is a pretty fundamental exposition of Jobs' cantankerous, unforgiving, deeply focused drive for perfection in the future; not the past. It's electrifying.This movie is low on action; instead we get two hours of fast-paced, intimate dialogue in typically brilliant Aaron Sorkin style that will surely reap for him a further Oscar.What's odd is that the movie picks quite a short (15 year) window in Jobs career (mostly its downside). I can't help thinking the project overall might have better suited an 8 hour TV serial broadening its scope to the full Monty in all of its ups and downs. But, no matter, Danny Boyle has shown that when he focuses on smaller detailed character pieces his output is at its best, and this, unquestionably, is a career high sitting alongside, Sunshine, The Beach and Shallow Grave in my opinion.Once again how can I find words to describe the quality and range of Michael Fassbender's prodigious output? Surely this will break his Oscars duck because despite some of the film's weaknesses they are not down to him. A compelling and sympathetic performance that is entirely engaging.I'll leave the last word for Daniel Pemberton's beautiful and understated soundtrack. It's reminiscent in many places of Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose's brilliant Social Network score.A solid 8/10.",8,0,3,18 November 2015
12 Years a Slave," A landmark in cinematic history
","Steve McQueen, the actor, all steely ice blue eyes, furrowed brow and golden locks was a Hollywood legend, 'The King of Cool'. His filmography is impressive (The Great Escape, The Thomas Crown Affair, Bullitt, Papillon, Magnificent Seven and Towering Inferno) yet the Academy only recognised him with a single nomination for his leading role, in the lesser known 1966 movie The Sand Pebbles, which he failed to convert.No lifetime achievement awards either. Nada.And yet his name pervades popular cultural as toweringly as the inferno he escaped from.Fast forward to 2008 and and his namesake and former visual artist, (he was the official Iraq War artist in 2003) makes his feature movie bow. By then McQueen already has an OBE (2002) to his name, for services to the arts, before he even sat in a director's chair -he won the highly prestigious Turner prize in 1999.In 2011 he added a CBE to his honours.Today he may be on the cusp of eclipsing the achievements of his illustrious predecessor.McQueen honed his craft by making no fewer than 20 shorts before embarking on Hunger; his breathtaking debut feature that tells the story of Bobby Sands and the 'Dirty Protests' in Belfast's Maze prison, with his, so far, ubiquitous right hand man, Michael Fassbender.Shame, in 2011, continued his elevation to directorial greatness in a shocking tale of sexual addiction.For me, it is something of a surprise that neither Hunger, nor Shame, were recognised in the best movie categories of either the BAFTAs or The Oscars, but that is all about to change with 12 Years a Slave. Indeed it already has 10 nominations at the BAFTAs and surely chief amongst them is McQueen's.Whatever you may think of the movie itself it's the point of it that deserves most attention and applause. Now, that sounds worthy but it shouldn't be seen as such because it is not just a monumental piece of filmmaking, but one with purpose, vision and bravery.The first EVER feature film about slavery. How can that be? The politics of America that's how.Sure, Tarantino made a brilliant pastiche of slavery last year with Django Unchained, and for those of us of a certain age Roots long lives in our memory (but that was a TV series). So too, Lincoln focused heavily on the issue, but not the experience.This, however, is a full on cinematic release described by one reviewer as the 'greatest film ever made' that unswervingly captures the experience of one man kidnapped from a life of freedom, of privilege, in 1841 New York and transported to the sweltering cotton and sugar cane fields of the deep south.What follows is almost two hours of unremitting injustice, backache, torture and frustration as the aforementioned Solomon Northup tries to prove his status as a free man, fighting injustice when he can but more often than not having to suffer in silence to protect his very existence.Chiwetel Ejiofor, in the title role, is on screen throughout, sweating like no actor I've ever seen, in the oppressive Southern heat and humidity.His performance is both proud and defiant and as the movie progresses increasingly moving.Once again Fassbender commands the screen as evil plantation and slave owner, Edwin Epps, but at times scenes are stolen by his super-evil wife played by Sarah Paulsen.Brad Pitt scoops an important cameo role, perhaps thanks to his role as Executive Producer and, by all accounts, he is one of the main catalysts for the movie to happen. It's only fair that his character is a catalyst for the resolution of the movie.Benedict Cumberbatch also puts in another fine cameo performance as the one 'good guy' plantation owner and initial 'owner' of Solomon Northup. The counterpoint between him and Paul Dano as the plantation overseer is excellent.Other supporting roles are well played, but this is essentially Ejifor and Fassbender's movie.No, it's not actually, it's McQueen's.This is a masterclass in direction with foot perfect cinematography, a very good score by Hans Zimmer. The movie's perfectly paced, with just the right amount of lingering mood and tense action. One scene in which Fassbender's concubine is whipped to within an inch of her life is truly appalling. You flinch at every stroke. By contrast the scene where Northup simply turns his head right to left, up and down, as if to say 'help' is breathtaking in its simplicity and resonance.It WILL go down in history as an important document of America's deepest guilt that festers even today, and McQueen WILL win both his first Oscar and a Knighthood.Above all else though, it is a great, really great, movie.",10,6,12,12 January 2014
There Will Be Blood," Overrated but very interesting nonetheless
","I had so been looking forward to this movie, for so long, and had to bide my time to see it.However, on a wet Monday afternoon in Glasgow my chance finally arrived.PT Anderson is right up there among my favourite directors of all time with Magnolia in my top 5 films, ever! News of Daniel Day Lewis' performance and his (as it turns out justified) favouritism for the Best Actor Oscar only added to my anticipation.The film's position as No. 23 EVER on IMDb's review list (my filmic bible) meant it had to be a total classic.So I'm afraid I have to beg to differ.Whilst much of it amazes there is just too much indulgence in this movie. The first 20 minutes when, famously, not a word is uttered feels to me like film w***. It is overlong as well and I felt the cinematography failed to reach the top drawer; it's simply too dark in places.The theme of greed is interesting but it feels a bit derivative of Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand - the famous book of the 50's - although I gather the inspiration was drawn from a little known novel called 'Oil'. And there are rather too many moments where Daniel Plainview played, mostly magnificently, by Daniel Day Lewis, is symbolised as the Devil incarnate sheathed in shards of flame and plumes of smoke. OK PT, we get it The context in which this greed is acted out is Oil Boom America (the first third of the last century). It centres around an oil prospector's run ins with an unnamed fundamentalist Christian outback church.The parallels between Bush and Iraq are not difficult to see.Whilst the congregation may be innocent worshippers, the relationship between the young pastor (Dano) and Plainview, is the real axis of the movie and it meets with mixed results. Partly because Dano's performance is not 100% convincing. Close, but no cigar.Indeed the denouement was, I thought, verging on the absurd.Daniel Day Lewis' descent into madness is well observed and he manages to avoid the excesses of Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York. However, having seen most of the big movies of the year his was probably the best male lead performance - although I felt Ellen Page in Juno and Javier Bardem in A Country For Old Men were better, purer, more believable constructs.Which brings me to my final point. The Coen's movie beats it hand down on every level except for the score, which is stunning.Jonny Greenwood was responsible.Verdict? 7/10. (Still an A in old money, but I was expecting a straight 10)",7,6,13,26 February 2008
Joker," Quite simply, perfection.
","'A gritty character study of Arthur Fleck, a man disregarded by society' is IMDB's excellent byline description of this deep exploration of disintegrating (disintegrated?) mental health.It's described as taking place in the 'Scorseseverse' by some critics, in that Phoenix's performance as Arthur Fleck appears to be an homage to many of Scorsese's monumental 70's characters. And what's more, De Niro has a supporting role that shows he still can deliver the goods when not just taking a part for the money.So I've already used the M word and in this Academy Award winning performance (of that there is no doubt) Joaquim Phoenix's monumental performance will put the Academy back on track after their laughable decision to recognise Rami Malek for impersonating Freddie Mercury last year.I detest impersonation movies on the whole, but this is no impersonation, this is a character crafted out of magic. It's not a superhero movie in the slightest and all the better for it. It's simply a character study of great depth and extreme nuance.One thing I loved about this intense study of a disintegrating man is the extreme close ups that shows Phoenix in all his imperfections, his upper lip, his wonky teeth, his chewed finger nails, his nicotine stained fingers (possibly make-up). It's glorious.It is unquestionably a masterpiece, not just for Phoenix's performance, but for every SINGLE aspect of cinema: music (White Room by Cream blasts out of the screen in the final apocalyptic act to tremendous effect - but it's outstanding throughout), make-up (stunning), costume (stunning), cinematography (stunning - the dance on the steps and the aerial train track shot particularly blew me away), design (epic) and direction (Todd Phillips follows up his epic production, but not direction, of A Star Is Born remarkably It's interesting looking at Todd Phillips' Filmography though - a real mixed bag with much of it centred on comedy - The Hangover in particular.)But you don't need me to tell you how good this movie is - you don't get a 9.1 rating on IMDB without reason.See it and bathe in its mastery.",10,4,6,6 October 2019
Whiplash," Nothing less than a straight ten is fair for this electrifying emotional blockbuster.
","As the end credits rolled I let out an uncontrollable cheer and burst into spontaneous applause.It wasn't a film festival premiere, it was a cold Saturday matinée in Edinburgh in early January.But I had been emotionally unravelled. I'd been through the wringer and had come out the other end a whooping fan boy.Exhausted, I staggered from the cinema gasping for breath. How on earth could a movie about a Jazz teacher and his drumming protégé elicit such a visceral reaction? It's hard to say why because on the surface (subject aside) there is little that's fundamentally original about the movie's structure. But what there is, is two absolutely gut-wrenching and enthralling performances that smash your emotions all over the cinema. Hits to the solar plexus are about the size of it.The story concerns the relationship between a 19 year old drumming major in his first year at North America's best music conservatory and his desire to succeed at almost any cost in carving out a springboard and a shop window for a future career as a 'Lincoln Centre' core member.His tutor is, if anything, even more focused than he is, and certainly as unforgiving and intolerant of anything less than perfection as it's possible to be.The result is a fascinating emotional power struggle, shot through with manipulation by both protagonists.Much has been said about JK Simmons' barbaric performance as the tutor and Jazz Studio conductor who has expectations the height of Everest. But far less credit has been given to the equally powerful turn by his pupil played by Miles Teller. Simmons simply could not have achieved the heights he has without this perfect foil.The film smoulders from the opening scene and aside from Simmons and Teller pretty much nothing else matters (other than Charlie Parker, Buddy Rich et al whose canon of work is electrifyingly brought to life by the Studio Jazz Band that Teller so wants, no needs, to join).Much of it consists of boot camp scenarios where imperfections are punished again and again and again. It's these scenes that create the unbearable tension. But punctuating these are the human side of it - like Teller's inability to build any relationships at all, other than with his single father. Drumming is always more important. And not just drumming; but drumming fame.Do not let the subject matter put you off. Do not let the fact that this is a jazz infused hour and a half, much of it in performance put you off. This really is a very special movie indeed and fully deserves a straight ten rating.",10,0,1,21 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," DiCaprio's career high. One of Scorsese's best
","Misogynistic, homophobic, a little bit racist, heightist, sexist, uber pro-consumerism, violent, abusive, scandalous, a significant put down to the American working classes, at times almost soft porn and certainly not in the least sympathetic to any of its female characters.What's not to like about The Wolf of Wall Street?Marti Scorsese has either taken leave of his senses or decided that there's a time and a place to just let rip and have a bit of good old fashioned fun.Mark Kermode certainly doesn't agree. He spluttered all 'Old Liberal' into his green tea as he let rip in his Guardian review that this was essentially overlong, vacuous sensationalism. I couldn't agree less. It's an absolute blast from frame #1 to frame #4,475. Clocking in at 179 minutes you might expect this to be turgid and variably paced, but ace veteran editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, makes sure it keeps cracking along. It's Scarface meets the Goodfellas in an extended Bacchanalian orgy of sex and drug-taking that Joanna Lumley must have mischievously approved of, given her amusing cameo role.Has DiCaprio ever been better? Well, he was very good in The Departed, Revolutionary Road and The Aviator but this is surely his greatest (fourth time Oscar nominated) role in which he dominates the screen with a highly enjoyable supporting performance by Jonah Hill.The tale is about a stockbroker, DiCaprio as real life trader Jordan Belford, who begins his career on the day of the 80's Wall Street Crash and earns his nickname, and the movie's title, soon after in a Forbes Magazine article when the journalist profiling him names him such for his outrageous duping of America's working classes ('Postmen, why are they always postmen.?') selling them worthless penny shares on the promise of unimaginable wealth.Far from exposing him, as the journalist hoped, it opens a floodgate of demand, not just from investors but from wannabe stockbrokers too.The movie is electrifyingly shot and edited. DiCaprio is a man possessed and Scorsese is on absolute fire with a hugely beefed up Greek Chorus of baying and howling trading floor macho- men whooping and cheering every one of his (Tom Cruise in Magnolia-like) pep talks, come training sessions. (Complete with naked brass bands, dwarf throwing competitions, female head shaving, orgies, and drugs aplenty.)Nudity is never far away. All of it female and most of it full frontal, including that of DiCaprio's Trophy second-wife, New Yorker Naomi , bravely played by long time 'Neighbours' cast member Margot Robbie who really couldn't have made much more of a career leap. She's great.At 71 Scorsese has never had more fun. And the movie, throwaway as it is in many respects - it has no 'message as such 'other than 'this is bad' - takes its place near the top of his 'best of' CV, alongside the Departed, Cape Fear, Goodfellas, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver. Not because it has the sheer weight of these incredible movies but because it is made by a master in total control of his work. He ekes out a horrible, unsympathetic but spellbinding performance from one of Hollywood's most starry actors. This is something for DiCaprio to be proud of. Indeed, he may yet pick up his first best actor award at the Koodak Cinema in March (but, of course, there's Christian Bale and Mtthew McConnachie to contend with).Sadly, I think Scorsese will have to settle for an outrageous ninth losing nomination as best director as he graciously applauds a fellow director (this time Steve McQueen) the same night. That's as maybe. Put your PC sensitivities to one side for 179 minutes and just enjoy the ride. It's an absolute blast.",9,4,10,19 January 2014
The Last King of Scotland," The abuse of power, brought into sharp focus,
","'I thought I was going to have a heart attack watching that!' my wife exclaimed as she emerged from the cinema after this heart in mouth movie. I'm sure many millions of Ugandans at the time of Idi Amin's sick rule would empathise with that emotion.The really insightful thing about Kevin MacDonald's film is how effortlessly he dramatises the seductive charms that so many dictators like Amin impose on their subjects. You almost like Whittaker's Amin. He's cheeky, funny, charming - even vulnerable at times.Power is a very powerful thing. It's when people get close to that power that their behaviour can be seriously affected. And the depiction of that is what lies at the heart of this great movie.You just about get as far as thinking that Amin is a more likable character than Dr Garrigan (James McEvoy)- his willingly co-opted personal physician. Just about.Garrigan is never complicit in any of Amin's crimes, but the movie brilliantly demonstrates how Amin (played beautifully and Oscar winningly by Forrest Whitaker) corrupts him. His arrogates towards the British Ambassador, his disposal of the rural missionaries he came to Uganda to help in the first place and his sleeping around (even with one of Amin's wives) are all utterly selfish. And fuelled by his close personal relationship with Amin.The film winds itself up into a crescendo of violence to the that's like sitting in the launchpad in Space Mountain (believe me that's a scary moment).Thought provoking and authentic, thanks partly to shooting on location and partly due to Whittaker's performance this is a very good movie indeed.",9,6,7,21 January 2007
The Reader," sensitive treatment of a difficult subject
","I watched this riveting movie without prior knowledge of the book which it is sourced from by Bernard Schlink. Some reviewers had implied that it is hard to follow given a complex flashbacks plotting device but neither I nor Jeana had any difficulty in keeping up.It's very good. Kate Winslet's performance is, in my view, a career high and the young Michael Berg, played by David Kross, puts in an outstanding turn as Winslet's young (underage) lover, before the part is taken over beautifully by Ralph Feinnes. Lena Olin has only a very small part at the end of the movie, playing the daughter of a Holocaust survivor but her role is fundamental to the film's denouement and she carries it off stunningly.I'd rather not spoil the plot by revealing the key central twist which you can see coming, but it is very effective and takes the third act of the movie into a new, and unexpected dimension. The first act is essentially a seduction and the second, a courtroom drama. All three are paced slowly but carefully. In lesser hands this film could have gone so wrong in so many ways but the acting is supplemented by great writing (David Hare - well, what do you expect) direction (Steven Daldry) and Cinematography (Roger Deakins whose last brilliant movie was No Country For Old Men). Indeed the movie is nominated for best film, writing directing and supporting actress at the Golden Globes. Quite rightly in my opinion.It's very moving and given the nature of Winslet's role it's a tribute to her and the production team that you sympathise with her throughout, even though she clearly would not find universal favour.7.5 out of 10.",7,2,2,4 January 2009
The Wrestler," A beautiful study of life in and out of the ring
","I missed this first time round but watched it on DVD last night. Funnily enough, I watched Crazy Heart the night before and the two films felt very much of the same sentiment.Sean Penn won the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Harvey Milk in Milk which was a great performance but I think the Academy must have debated long and hard who give it to. I think they made the wrong choice because although both Penn and Mickey Rourke actors carry their respective movies Penn's portrayal was more of an impersonation; Rourke's is a possession.The story follows the fictional comeback years of a once great Wrestler (The Ram) who still has a loyal following and top billing, but in provincial events where the new generation are creating ever more bizarre wrestling characters with weirder and weirder means of entertaining their audiences. A life time of substance abuse has rendered The Ram susceptible to too much exertion and it is when he faces the 'Necro Butcher' and his unorthodox method of staple gunning (with permission of course) his opponents that it all gets too much for Rourke and he suffers a heart attack that needs a bypass to save his life.The operation brings him briefly to his senses and so we enter act 2 in which he tries to rekindle love in his life for his 21 year old daughter (nicely played by Evan Rachel Wood) and his 'tart with a heart' lap dancing on-off flame.Marisa Tomie, who plays the part, is awesome and certainly deserved her Oscar nomination; sadly she too failed to convert. But it's all too much for both The Ram and his Beaus. The lure of the ring finally gets him back with a hair raising finale in which he takes on his old enemy 'The Ayatollah' in a stage managed fiasco that simply breaks the heart.This is a stunning character piece played by an actor who has made more comebacks than the character he lays. But Rourke is godlike. It is intensely reminiscent of e Niro's performance in Raging Bull not just because of the subject matter but for the commitment that both men put into their job. At 56 this was surely an even greater feat by Rourke than the then still young Di Niro. But the film is more than a testosterone laden gross out. It's a heartfelt and beautiful study of failure i life, in love and in everything except integrity.",9,0,0,9 January 2011
Inception," Over hyped and over blown. Over and out.
","Having seen this 24 hours ago the more I think about it the more I think this is over-hyped and actually a rather poor movie. On leaving the cinema I was prepared to give it a 7 (well short of it's 9.3 on IMDb) but on reflection I'm downgrading it to a 5.5.Why? For a start the writing is ridiculously weak. The plot, although slightly intriguing in that you do make the effort to keep up with the triple (or is it quadruple) levels of depth, is preposterous. In short it's about a dream within a dream within a dream. I think that's correct! But, that said, who cares? It might be crafty but it isn't crafted. It's self indulgent in the extreme.Whilst not gratuitously violent, there are a lot of killings in this film, but the 'goodies' are dead eye dicks to a man (and woman) whilst the 'baddies' are way, way beyond inept. With five targets and two and a half hours of incessant shooting I counted only 2 direct hits, whereas the 'baddies' must have taken in excess of 200 fatalities. Just plain silly really.Then there's the casting. Di Caprio is starting to look desperate for a decent acting part and Ellen Page absolutely sucks compared to her magnificent role in Juno (it's the writing I tell ya).The special effects are at times good, on one or two occasions I'd call them remarkable, but not on many. As an emotional engagement exercise it has all the impact of a potato. I've been more moved by a night in watching Blomberg TV.Christopher Nolan is just not that great a director or writer on this occasion.Sorry folks.(His mind was the scene of a crime.)",5,14,25,18 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Elementary movie making. Flawed but great.
","The new incarnation of Holmes by Robert Downie Jr is fascinating. His relationship with Watson (played by Jude Law) continues that enduring Holmesian 'is he, isn't he' gay frisson which is suitably mashed up with the introduction of female love interests on both sides (Law's played demurely - dully actually - by Kelly Reilly and Holmes' rather better by Rachel McAdams).Central to the film's success is Law and Downie Jr who really make you believe there is life in this as a new franchise. Both (yes even Law) are excellent. And especially when they are on screen together they are great; carrying off the dialogue knowingly and often laugh out loud funnily.It's a great smorgasbrod of action, humour and special effects with enough Holmsian explanation of who did what and why to keep the interest up.The set needs special mention as a London in which Tower Bridge is under construction plays a character role. It's really quite beguiling, and although much CAD is used it works.The effect of a ship (also under construction) being set loose down a slipway is eye boggling and the use of lots of flying objects heading for the camera genuinely makes you duck (so who needs 3D then?) Now for the bad news. It's long, way too long. And the story is pretty silly really. I won't bore you with the details here. The oft used metaphor of a raven of death marking character obliteration is naff (first year film school).But overall I give it a healthy 7.5 out of 10. (The scene in the boxing booth justifies entry alone.) Good honest entertainment.",7,3,5,28 December 2009
Arrival," Very good, if a little on the slow side. Thoughtful and thought provoking Sci fi.
","If you are looking for Star Wars levels of excitement stop right here. This is the wrong movie.If you love Terence Malick step this way.OK, so we have hopefully established that this is thinking man and women's sci-fi. By that I mean it's quite slow. But it's beautiful and crafted and emotionally engaging. The Aliens that arrive on earth in 12 seemingly unrelated locations do not appear to be warmongers, but are they? What is their motive? To find that out humankind will need to collaborate globally in finding a common language or means to communicate.That's gonna be tricky when three of the countries involved (Russia, China and Pakistan) are not commonly associated with collaborative political working (a bit too much Cold War/Axis of Evil rhetoric here for my liking) and indeed these are the three countries that prove most troublesome and potentially trigger-happy in the plot.Throughout, I was wondering what would happen here if this was real and Donald Trump was in office. It doesn't bear thinking about frankly.Anyway, thankfully for humankind it's Amy Adams as a poly linguistic professor called Fiona that's in charge of negotiations with the Montana located spaceship full of Heptapods (7 legged floating Octopi). Beautifully and sympathetically rendered.Her accession to the post is a direct result of her in depth understanding of the Sanskrit word for war and its meaning (A desire for more cattle) unlike her potential competitor.(Blink and you'll miss that.)Forest Whitaker recruits Adams, playing a passable General in charge of alien negotiation, and Adams is joined in her quest by mathematician Ian played in a nicely understated fashion by the always excellent Jeremy Renner.But this is Adams' movie (she's a n increasingly class act) and it's obvious why she is receiving Oscar nods (I doubt this is a winning role though).Like everything about this understated movie the cinematography and special effects are designed to seduce rather than excite, but for me Bradford Young's Dickensian lighting underwhelmed rather than understated.Johan Johannson's music is a big plus. It underscores beautifully and clearly takes some cues from Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Indeed this is the movie that it most resonates with; that and 2001 A Space Odyssey.The back story of Adams' life has a brilliant twist that uncoils slowly but surely and makes the whole a deliciously complex tale to unravel. It's worth it in my opinion; but not my companion's, who opined that it was 'two hours of my life I won't get back, even if Jeremy Renner is nice to look at'.Way above average, thoughtful, slow moving but grown up sic-fi.Just don't expect Jedi forces.",7,1,6,16 November 2016
Parasite," It's fine. I just didn't think it was as great as everyone else seems to think.
","I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops.Let's get a couple of things straight before the off.I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers' to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs.I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.)I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful.So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation.I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it.I had no issue with understanding it.It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste.Except he does.As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable.Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue.Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode.The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared.The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read.The cinematography is simply beautiful.It's a fine movie, but in my view 1917 was a more immersive cinematic experience and consequently deserved the Best Picture Academy Award.Call me what you like, but I'm saying what I'm seeing.",7,5,8,24 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Unique. A challenging but hilarious master class in modern film making.
","It's as if Alejandro González Iñárritu and Michael Keaton have been on an unintended collision course towards the inevitable making of this art-house meets superhero movie - although Kick Ass managed to subvert the latter genre it only did so on a single dimension; this does so on multiple levels.To even allude to it as a Superhero movie is, of course, to massively understate what is a film bristling with more ideas than a month-long sabbatical at Stephen Hawking's house.It starts with the poster, moves onto the credits (the best I've seen for years) and then; scene one act one.Every scene brings another 'how did he do that?' in fact 'how did he think of that?' moment.In fact the scenic structure is the first big jaw drop aspect of the movie given that, essentially, scene one act one is all there is - it, arguably, never ends. Cleverly stitched together in the edit suite and captured by Emmanuel Lubezki the whole film is an homage to the ambitions of Orson Welles in his monumental 'El Rancho' tracking shot from Citizen Kane.Lubezki's camera prowls the dressing rooms, corridors and backstage areas of a Broadway Theatre endlessly, where washed up ex-superhero (the Birman of the title) star, Riggan Thomas played in a career defining performance by Michael Keaton is mounting a self- funded, self-adapted, self-directed and self-starring play of a Raymond Carver short story. The trouble is; it sucks.But after the weak link in the four man cast is nearly decapitated during late rehearsals, a big box office stand in, Mike Shiner, ((played magnificently by Edward Norton) takes his place the day before the first preview. Shiner may be a true star vehicle and 'box-ioffice gold' but his highly contrived method-acting is a massive pain in the ass and causes mayhem both on-stage and off.Meanwhile, trying to direct the volatile Shiner plus his equally volatile girlfriend (more of a cameo but again brilliant by Angela Risborough) Keaton's character starts to fall apart, simultaneously haunted by his alter ego (the bird man that is embedded in his avian brain).The action is relentless, breathtaking actually, as it is driven along by an incessant jazz drum solo that peppers the score.Keaton looks and acts more and more like Bill Murray in his prime but his performance goes far deeper than anything I've ever seen Murray achieve (with the possible exception of Lost in Translation). It's dark, tragic and sensitive. The awful relationship he 'enjoys' with his clearly disgruntled 'assistant' and rehabilitating daughter, Sam, played to scuzzy perfection by Emma Stone is remarkable. In one scene Stone berates Keaton for his inept fathering skills to the point that you genuinely think her head might actually burst open. It's electrifying.As the frankly bizarre story unfolds more and more levels of pathos, black humour and tension are introduced; the pursuit of short term fame is brought brilliantly to life when Keaton 'trends on twitter' after an inadvertent stroll through Times Square in his jockeys. The veneer of fame and the dubiousness of acting ability - 'You're a celebrity not an actor' sneers New York Times theatre critic played viciously by Lindsay Duncan in another notable cameo just before she sets out to crucify him: just because she can.And we meet up with Keaton's superhero past an an entirely unexpected way.The opening night of the play brings a denouement that I dare you to predict. You won't. You can't.I've had my eye on Alejandro González Iñárritu since his debut feature in 2000, the heartbreaking Amores Perros, through 21 Grams and Babel and most recently the battering ram that is Biutiful. All these movies deal in big issues around the human condition. All break your heart in different ways and all are light, very light, in humour. So for him to create a comic masterpiece such as this is all the more disconcerting really. It has many, many laugh out loud moments but at its heart lies yet another big human condition movie. How can one create true happiness in life when relationships are such fragile things in the world of celebrity? What is art? What indeed is fame?As Andy Warhol said; we all have 15 minutes of it. The trouble is, for many, the real stuff is like crack cocaine and we all know that's a hard one to kick.",9,6,14,7 January 2015
The Big Short," Why the Big Short disappointed me so much.
","Let's start positive.Christian Bale pulls another great performance out of the bag.(Possibly his second Oscar.)And so does Steve Carell. (Should have been nominated.)And the music is amazing. As you leave to Led Zeppelin's crushing 'When The Levee Breaks' you could be striding, like a Wall Street Trader, all big balled and bouffant into the night, wind rushing through your long shiny hair all attitoodinal.You could be walking into a high maintenance Strip Club to be drooled over.You could. You really could.Except you're not.Because the last two hours of your life were a mess.You've seen an edit room meltdown. Let's face it, in places the editing in this movie is just sub frickin' prime man. But I can see why Hank Corwin is nominated. It's original. (But it's style over story telling).This movie is an economics lesson that wants to be so, so, so cool that you might even start to like economics in such a way that it blows it. But it forgets one very important thing.Great movies tell stories. This movie is not a story. It's SO NOT a story. It's just a mess. And any amount of Led Zeppelin and Steve Carell at his best and Bradd Pitt at his most subdued, modest, handsome, pouty self doesn't save it.It's a mess.And that's why it fails.(And as for Margot Robbie. Oh come on.)I kinda liked it all the same.",6,1,3,23 February 2016
Prometheus," Not a patch on Alien. But what is?
","'In space nobody can hear you scream' proclaimed the poster for Alien.Even before you stepped into the cinema back in 1979 you knew, you'd read, you'd heard that you were going to be wincing with fear and disgust. When John Hurt's chest was ripped open by a baby monster you did scream. It was, and still is, a monumental movie.Fast forward 33 years and the 'cinema event of the year' arrives with reel after reel of preview film but little in the way of proper reviews. No talk about what the content was. I feared it was a studio ploy. Keeping the film away from the critics because it wasn't that good. And then, right at the last minute the reviews appeared. 'Hmmm' that was the general consensus. So I went to my local multiplex in a state of anxiety. Could it possibly live up to the hype? Right let's get one thing out of the way right from the off. 3D does not make movies better, arguably the opposite, as directors strive to create set ups that allow them to show off the technique. The only 3D movie I've seen that even remotely benefits from the exercise is Avatar. Prometheus just doesn't need it.By now you'll know the basic premise of the movie. Say what they like, but it IS a prequel to Alien and the obsession Ridley Scott has with the creation of man, religion, Darwinism and all such borders on the insane. It makes for some laboured moments and overblown plotting. The movie overall is too long (a common mistake these days) and lacks both pace, at times, and screams.This simply does not scare you like Alien did, but apart from those criticisms it is a fine theatrical experience. It looks astounding, it has good central performances from Noomi Rapace and Michael Fassbender and adequate back up from the rest (although Kate Dickie is hopelessly miscast).It's a good film. Just not a patch on Alien. There's an obvious sequel standing in the wings but I guess we'll have to see how this fares at the box office before taking the plunge because this ain't a cheap exercise ($120m - which incidentally is only half what Avengers Assembled cost)",7,1,4,5 June 2012
Marriage Story," A beautifully poignant essay on divorce with stand out performances amongst all the leads.
","The movie the attorneys didn't want to be made.In which a loving but separating couple (played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) blow any possibility of a harmonious separation by bringing in their legal aides.It's a sad old movie in which the couple's divorce seesaws from still best friends to raging monsters. Their natural inclination seems to favour behaviour at the friendlier end of the spectrum, but by employing teams of attorneys (at great cost), whose only interests are fiscal and competitive, any of the harmony that remains between Driver and Johansson is cruelly exposed and used as a weakness.In the hands of a director less skilled than Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding, Frances Ha) we could easily have ended up with either a black comedy or an overwrought drama, but this finds a line between the two, by steering a complex and subtle, and lengthy, dialogue (he is the writer) that does not allow the viewer to particularly side with either protagonist - both have their faults and their virtues - but it's the actions of their attorneys that bring out the worst, not the best, in them.That said my wife and I both fell for Driver's side of the story (and only found out afterwards that the movie is based on BaunBach's own experience of divorcing Jennifer Jason Leigh, so maybe it's not quite as agnostic as we thought.It's a slow build, with several long monologues that just finish, mostly, before they outstay their welcomes.But there are also moments of humour. The visit of a social worker is laugh out loud funny and the rehearsal scene where Johansson prepares her terrified sister to hand over the divorce papers is likewise an absolute comic joy.But overall it's both deeply personal and very affecting at times, more than once I was reaching for the Kleenex, and part of that is down to the casting and the highly personal cinematography that shows off the two leads at their most naked (emotionally) and vulnerable with long, lingering close ups on each of them. That's one reason that the big screen is always better than the TV for feature films. Like The Irishman, though, this is a Netflix original and will not be on the big screen for long.Driver is at the top of his game and that means there are three serious Oscar best actor contenders this year - himself, De Niro and Phoenix. All three would win in any average year. Driver's one take performance of Stephen Sondheim's 'Being Alive' at a piano bar is a real highlight and is about a man';s lack of commitment. It's an excellent counterpoint to Randy Newman's typically accomplished, and in parts quite jaunty, score.Johannson puts in a career-best shift. Not only is his beauty put to one side . No make up and often unflattering close ups, but she acts her socks off.Also of great note is laura Dern's performance as her lawyer and a cameo role for a sprightly, 83 year old, Alan Alda.It's a slow burn but it comes highly recommended from me (and my wife). Just go see it in the cinema.",9,139,217,25 November 2019
Mother!," Aranofsky's masterpiece but it's not for everyone.
","Darren Aronofsky has followed up his biblical epic, Noah, with another biblical horror story starring Jennifer Lawrence (his partner in real life) and Javier Bardem.Whilst advance publicity had suggested this might be heavily inspired by Rosemary's Baby this is not in fact the case.  Far from it. Rosemary's Baby is about the birth of Satan. This is not.I found it helpful to know in advance what the premise of this film was and there is  a brilliant deconstruction of the plot in a great article by Adam White in the Telegraph. (Google it)You may not want to know before you see it, but it's a great read after the fact and confirmed most of my assumptions about the heavy allegory and metaphor used in the movie.To make two consecutive biblical films is surprising because Aronofsky has declared his atheism but presumably the source material is such brilliant storytelling that he simply could't resist.What results in mother! is a film of such epic proportions, such horror, such artistry that at times your jaw actually drops.  Aronofsky stops at nothing.  There are no sacred beliefs that he cannot explore or visualise.  What he does not do is ridicule them.  This is a representative telling of Genesis, the New Testament,  earth science theory and sustainability all wrapped in one great Gothic whole.And it's gorgeous, sumptuous and creepy.The performances by Bardem and Lawrence are electrifying, albeit their togetherness as man and wife seems unlikely, but as the plot unravels it's obvious why.The appearance of a married couple in the shape of Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer (both extraordinary performances) into their lives is startling in its aloofness and cruelty.  One feels Lawrence's panic bubbling over as the idyll she is trying to create in an island home is about to gradually unwind.And unwind it does; in increasingly spectacular fashion.I'm not going to go into spoiler territory (read the Telegraph article for that - after you've seen the movie) so I'll stop here.  Suffice it to say that although this won't appeal to many; for those that it does this is a truly great movie.",9,3,12,21 September 2017
Casino Royale," I am converted
","Sadly I was brought up during Roger Moore's (long) Bond reign. And consequently I thought Bond sucked. So much so that I've not even been tempted to explore the much lauded Connery franchise. Recent efforts seem to have been desperate attempts to get back on the rails, but have failed to convince me. But this. This is a proper movie. It is just great. Bond in love? Bond vulnerable? Bond nearly dying? Daniel Craig is simply magnificent. I loved his rudeness and hostility (he barely once says please or thank you during the movie) but when he has to be sentimental he is. Funny? Ditto. Sexy? Yip.Forget comparing this to other Bond movies. Compare this to other movies. It stands up very well.OK, it is a touch on the long side. But...Bond is back.Daniel Craig - if you stay as Bond I'll be there every time.",8,2,4,24 November 2006
Toy Story 3," Perfection. Simple as that.
","I missed this on its theatrical release but had the very great pleasure of watching it on DVD at home last night. There is talk that TS3 is a live contender for the overall movie Oscar and I wouldn't argue with that, because alongside Monsters (which won't win) The Kids are All Right, Let Me In and Social Network this is amongst the last year's best.It's one of the most engaging, laugh out loud funny and deeply moving movies I've seen in a long time. It unashamedly goes for the heartstrings in the final act as Andy leaves home to go to his Freshman year at a US college. And that's what this film is all about, the loss of childhood and what that means to a young man as he comes of age. It's clear from the off that Andy has a degree of maturity that is not normal amongst late teenage boys. He is a sensitive and thoughtful soul who really will be missed by both his Mum and his sister. Dad is never seen, is this a modern day dysfunctional family or is he just always at work. In this respect perhaps it is Andy that has assumed the role of Patriarch and hence his maturity. It matters not because after the establishing of his departure and before the hugely emotional denouement we have a comedy classic full of slapstick, crazy chases and, unusually, a brilliant plot. The script sizzles and the acting (by the usual humans - you know them all by now) is universally brilliant. Having watched TS1 the day before I was impressed with the technical advances in the animation. Pixar just keep getting better. For instance human movement which was a bit out of sync in TS1 has been nailed in TS3.Randy Newman has made the franchise his own with his bittersweet and mostly beautiful music. Perhaps the highlight in this instalment is Buzz Lightyear's fantastic Spanish rendition of 'You've got a friend.'",10,0,2,9 January 2011
Son of Saul," A bit disappointing to be honest
","This movie is not taken on lightly as an audience member. To classify it as 'entertainment' would certainly be wrong because the subject matter is so uncompromisingly challenging.I wanted to love it unreservedly for the bravery of its content but I'm afraid I was left a little cold. The film is shot in square format (possibly 4:3) which is immediately disarming and unusual (the last time I saw this was in the very different Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel) and it's used effectively because it gives the viewer a voyeuristic look into the mayhem that is Dachau where the movie is set. It also helps the director from a budgetary point of view because it eschews the need for expensive wide shots.The opening scenes are astonishingly harrowing as we see the 'pieces' of Jewish bodies essentially processed through the factory of death with disturbing, off screen, dog barks, German soldier orders and mechanical noise. It's brutal and affecting in the extreme.In some ways this is what I grotesquely wanted from the movie. I wanted to be horrified like no horror movie could achieve. Forgive me for this but it didn't happen. Yes, the mood was grotesque thanks, in particular, to the extraordinary sound design, but on screen I felt it shirked its potential too much.In the end this voyeuristic cinematography ultimately becomes both tiresome and limiting.The fundamental weakness of the movie, in my opinion, is in the storyline. Frankly it's not that credible and doesn't stack up. The main protagonist (Saul) discovers his (illegitimate?) son as a gas chamber survivor and smuggles him out of the situation to seek a Rabbi to give him a proper Jewish burial. This leads to a sequence of events that side stories with an undercover camp breakout in which he is also inexplicably involved.Sorry, it's not credible.And Géza Röhrig as the lead didn't really do it for me. And so the early wonderment of the movie, it really is very moving, starts to erode and gradually descends into incredibility.I love what this movie stands for. I respect every iota of it.I just didn't think it was particularly good overall.",6,53,85,30 April 2016
Looper," Sliding Doors with Guns.
","Let's get this straight. Looper is not, as many say, 'the Matrix of the 21st Century' it's 'Sliding Doors with Guns.'.It's a clever attempt to play with the concept of 'what might have been' on a very grand scale (although, interestingly, not, as I was expecting, on a mind boggling scale).It's a big movie but it's not one that, had it failed, would bring the studio to its knees and I kind of liked that. Clocking in at $30,000 ain't really that big a deal.It's set in 2047 in a now ragged USA with China having taken ascendancy in the world. I liked the fact that director and writer Rian Johnson (Brick) doesn't turn it into Blade Runner but adds a few neat sci-fi tricks (like flying motorbikes). Loopers are 'disposal men' of their future selves who are sent back from 2077 for, well disposal,. They are called Loopers because the film is all about time loops. 2044's Loopers are disposed of 30 years hence (and they know it) by themselves hence 'Closing the Loop', but occasionally it goes wrong such as here where Joe (our Hero played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to close the loop on himself (Old Joe played by Bruce Willis). But it all goes Pete Tong and so we now have two Joe's on the go.Young Cid (a remarkable performance by 5 year old Pierce Gagnon) has Telekinetic powers and a temper that makes Linda Blair look merely snippy in The Exorcist. He's the son of love interest (Sara) - played well by Emily Blunt) and he appears to be the key to the loops.I could go on but won't because there's a lot of detail to consume and there's 300 odd reviews here that will tell you all you need to know about the detail.Suffice to say it all pans out cleverly; the various loops are closed in perhaps unexpected ways and we are left with a movie that is clever, well acted, slick and genuinely original.It's a definite recommendation. 8/10.",8,0,2,26 October 2012
Annihilation," High quality sci-fi with a brain.
","If you have access to Netflix you have a treat in store.Annihilation is Alex Garland's second movie as director/writer after the Oscar nominated Ex-Machina and joins his writing portfolio that includes The Beach, Sunshine and 28 Days Later - all Danny Boyle movies.Starring Natalie Portman (usually pretty bland and fairly much so here) and the superb Jennifer Jason Leigh (who plays it down in this) it's a full on girl power let's take on the aliens movie without any aliens.The story concerns five female scientists who are sent into a strange growing entity called 'The Shimmer' on the coast of the USA hat hat has already chewed up and spat out a bunch of marines and inexplicably threatens life on earth. In its early days it needs dealt with and female scientists may hold the key.Inside 'The Shimmer' we find a world where DNA is 'refracted' in such a way that flora and fauna swap DNA and the resultant organisms range from extremely beautiful to hideously malformed. These along with a breakdown in the scientists' own DNA and organ tissue (leading to madness) form the threats to their existence as the seek the source of 'The Shimmer'.In many ways the concept is pretty close to standard fare but it is treated intelligently. (Too intelligently, it seems, for the US test cinema audience who didn't 'get it' and so it was released straight to Netflix.) Portman's back story adds interesting colour and fleshes the movie out without intruding.Maybe they tested int in the heart of Trump country because it's not that tricky. Anyway, cinema's loss, your gain. It's a cracking yearn, well acted, well scripted, clever and stunningly shot. My wife, who doesn't go for sci-fi ordinarily, loved it.Garland is a great ideas man and is already a gifted director. This is a sound addition to his canon of work and I highly recommend it.",8,2,5,20 March 2018
Spectre," If you need a sedative go see this boring rubbish
","Gosh. This is bad.Outrageously long would be my first criticism. Sam Mendes has too much power and seems like the studio is in awe of him.And so must be his editor, because every single scene in this very poor movie is over long.What's more, Daniel Craig looks past his sell by date and even my wife didn't fancy himSuch a shame because the opening sequence, before the parlous credits and garbage signature song by Sam Smith, is as good as it gets. Set in Mexico City during the festival of death it looks astonishing and the action sequence it spawns is very, very good.But after that it is a spent force.Rubbish action sequences, truly boring and just a dirge.Avoid at all cost.",4,2,7,15 November 2015
Joy," Ignore the critics this is another cracker from Russell with J Law on fire!
","In 1990 Joy Mangano invented the Miracle Mop.It was a complete flop and nearly bankrupt her and her family in the process.The US shopping channel's top sales on screen sales people couldn't work it and so her 'once in a lifetime' opportunity to make her millions turned into standing on the cusp of losing them instead.So she took matters into her own hands. She asked QVC to let her sell her mops herself on screen explaining 'I'm just like everybody else out there. I'm a mom, I work, I have a house to clean, things to organise. We all have certain similar needs, and I address them.' This came across in a very real and engaging way on QVC and the rest was history. She is now a $3 x billionaire.In Joy, Jennifer Lawrence puts in a performance that not only captures this spectacular rags to riches story but breaks your heart along the way. There really only is one Jennifer Lawrence with her myriad looks, faces and delightfully subtle intonations. JLaw is a force of nature.So too is David O. Russell, her doting director, who has now cast her in his last three excellent movies, including Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle (and, in all three, he places the brilliant Bradley Cooper alongside her). Always, the effect is cinematic magic. No less so here despite the relatively lukewarm reaction from IMDb voters and critics alike. (How can this be so?)The script appears to takes many liberties with the true life story for both comic and dramatic effect, but who cares it's a movie. The ensemble gathered around J Law's star vehicle performance also include a rejuvenated Robert De Niro as her morally dubious father, Isabella Rossellini (no really), Diane Ladd, Virginia Madsen and Elisabeth Rohm (as her rather hateful half sister). It works.Three, maybe four, times this movie made me completely fill up, not because of the fantastic human story but because of the remarkable performance by Jennifer Lawrence and the stunning direction of her by Russell.Ignore the critics. Just, not this one. You'll thank me.",8,3,11,9 January 2016
Slumdog Millionaire," Flawed but great in parts
","Well, the critics are getting awfully excited about this film, so I'd like to join the debate with a strong note of caution.This is a pretty good movie but I think the imperfection that lies at its heart is what stops it being a great movie. namely, the acting. Of it's 10 Oscar nominations not a single one is for the performances of its leading players and that is, in my view, totally appropriate.This movie is too much of a pick n mix affair to truly satisfy. The central cinematic device at its core, telling a life story (in three sub-generations; infant, child and teen means that its too stop-start to really fully engage.) What you find is that the two younger sections of the film are both more believable and more engaging than the latter stage which starts to unravel in credibility the more it develops.The performances of the two younger Jamals are light of touch, frequently hilarious - particularly in the movie's highlight where the youngest Jamal exits the latrines in true Trainspotting style - and quite moving. Poor old, rather wooden and not especially engaging, Dev Patel has to deal with a plot that is becoming more ridiculous by the moment as his pursuit of the beautiful Latika verges, at times, on the preposterous. How Salim can continually cross paths with the object of his affection so often in a city with a population twice that of the whole of the UK was beyond me.OK, that's all the bad stuff out of the way, now let's turn to the positives. The cinematography (an Oscar nod for Anthony Dod Mantle) and sound design in this movie combine to stunning effect at times. It's like a Discover documentary at its best and you simply cannot get enough of Mumbai, which is given added oomph by the music of A.R. Rahman who picks up no less than three Oscar nominations. Nice use of MIA's music in places too.It's actually all the technical disciplines that this movie excels in and has been recognised for (sound, sound editing, music, cinematography and editing). so that neatly brings us to its direction.Danny Boyle.What to make of him? Well, a director's job is to realise all aspects of a production from performance to technical. I think the script blew his chances of the former but he has excelled at the latter and to many it is seen as the highlight of his career. I beg to differ. His track record is patchy to say the least. Trainspotting is by far the most overrated film of its generation (not a patch on his brilliant Shallow Grave), The Beach and A Life Less Ordinary are best glossed over. But 28 Days Later is as good a horror movie as has been made since The Shining, and Sunshine is as good as it gets in Sci fi. Both are, in my humble opinion at least, better movies than Slumdog.But you lot don't seem to agree. A quick look at Boyle's IMDb ratings shows that the public consider Slumdog his masterpiece with a rating of 8.7 (astonishingly, that places it 34th in IMDb's all time list). How is this possible in a seemingly foolproof ratings mechanism? Early enthusiasm? Maybe as the ratings mature he will come back to the field. I'd think that will indeed be the case as old moaners like me get our way.Here are all his cinematic releases and how IMDb rate them; and my own views. Please feel free to scoff or agree as you see fit.Slumdog IMDb 8.7 Me 7 Sunshine IMDb 7.3 Me 9 28 Days later IMDb 7.5 Me 9 Shallow Grave IMDb 7.4 Me 9 Trainspotting IMDb 8.2 Me 5 (this is ranked 182 of all time on IMDb - Holy cow!) The Beach IMDb 6.2 Me 5 For the record, A life Less ordinary picks up 6.4 and Millions gets a 7.2 on IMDb. I haven't seen either, but the bit of ALLO that I saw looked poor.I like Slumdog a lot I have to say, but its imperfections were too significant to overlook. Much as I hoped it would indeed be the feelgood movie of all time (or whatever the marketing blurb claims) it wasn't, but it was a great visual and aural spectacle that merits a trip to your local cinema. 7 out of 10.",7,1,3,25 January 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Probably the greatest movie ever to deal with the transport of breast milk to and fro across a desert.
","We'll put to one side the fact that half way through the screening I was at in Newcastle a girl collapsed in the stairway which meant that I spent ten minutes or so helping her out. (She was fine in the end). But it certainly added a degree of drama to a movie that is anything but short of that.It's 30 years since George Miller last directed a Mad Max movie and in the interim he's treated us to rather more lightweight offerings such as Babe and Happy Feet.But clearly it's Mad Max that has become his trade mark and this (the fourth instalment, with a fifth on the way) is the best of the bunch in every respect other than the fact that Mel Gibson makes a better Max than Tom Hardy although, truth be told, this is as much, if not more, Charlize Theron's movie as Tom Hardy's. (She manages to look spectacularly beautiful throughout despite having her face covered in axle grease.)It's quite remarkable that a 70 year old man could imagine and then actually produce and direct a movie of this scale, scope and energy. In fact, it's mind boggling.And mind boggling is a very good word to describe the experience that is Mad Max: Fury Road. (I saw it in 3D but I don't think that added a lot to be honest).There is absolutely nothing intellectual to discuss about a movie that transports a bevy of beautiful 'breeders' across the desert and back again on board a tanker full of breast milk.The dialogue, when you can hear it, is pretty vacuous. The bevy of beauties are pretty vacuous but who cares, because it's such a splendid romp and a visual treat from get go to end credits.Time and again one's jaw drops as the sheer audaciousness of the endless vehicle chases as they unfold. Like most goody/baddie movies it is remarkable how inept the baddies are at killing the goodies who, by contrast, seem to kill with gay abandon, barely a shot or a strike not hitting its mark.But if you can park your critical faculties at the door, sit back and just steep yourself in two hours of OTT nonsense then you will be treated to pure pleasure for almost every frame.Cracking.",9,1,7,1 June 2015
The Social Network," The morality tale for the 21st century we've all been waiting for.
","It's not hard to imagine that a biopic of the creation of facebook - a project that isn't even complete as its rise to world domination continues unabated - could be monumentally bad. For a start all of the characters in the movie are real, alive and known litigation junkies. In fact the structure of the film is built around litigation.What's more, it's set in geek land, and it's populated by America's landed money generation; a class of kids who are not exactly imbued with likability. Add to that the layer of egotism of successful entrepreneurs, that has to be applied if this is going to be a true reflection of the situation. And early on the movie dwell on a scene where the two key characters get off on the creation of an algorithm in a Harvard dorm and we're in a place that has to be bad; does it not? Well actually, no it doesn't, in fact I can't recall a biopic with such historical realism that betters this magnificent creation.David Fincher is a director of some impact. Fight Club and se7en, to name but two of his grisliest creations, typically hit you hard from the off and keep on hitting. Not the sort of director you'd expect to be behind a successful exploration of coding in the Ivy League's finest Halls of residence. But what Fincher does is dial back the excess and zone in on a cast of young people that somehow creates a magnificent and fully fleshed ensemble whilst giving Jesse Eissenberg the star vehicle that at its core it has to be. His portrayal of Mark Zuckenberg has to be seen to be believed. And believe me you'll believe it. This is direction and acting of the highest calibre.The establishing scene of Eissenberg in a College Union bar being dumped by his lifetime love Erica Albright (played gently and beautifully by Rooney Mara) is jaw-droppingly good for three reasons; the camera work (subtle and gorgeous throughout especially the tilt shift effect later in the movie in England's Henley), the dialogue (well what did you expect, Aaron Sorkin wrote the script) and the acting. And that's it. We're off and running for nearly two hours where the action never stops for a second and yet,; not a swear word is heard, no fights, no sex, no nudity, no special effects - so how can this be an action movie? And yet it is, it's hilarious (but there are no gags, no slapstick) and it makes you think from start to finish. Because what Fincher and Sorkin have achieved is a morality tale for our time; not with the big crass in-your-faceness that Wall Street revels in, but in the intellectual ethics of IP. Wherever you look in the movie you're challenged to think who was right and who was wrong.IP changes hands and evolves at such a dizzying speed that one wonders was it the germ of the idea or its evolution that created Facebook's value? Was Napster creator and serial entrepreneur Sean Parker (slyly played by Justin Trousersnake) a bandwagon-jumping opportunist or the real creator of Zuckerberg's ultimate wealth? Was Zuckerberg an impressionable but lovable innocent or a self-centred traitor to his only friend Eduardo Severin (also played sympathetically and at times the axis of the movie by Andrew Garfeild)? Was Severin a philanthropist or a pariah and were the Winklevosses (I lied there are special effects in this movie) real? I particularly liked the fact that Sorkin and Fincher avoided the temptation to rip into these ridiculous stereotypes , and in so doing, and gave them at least a shred of dignity by the film's end.Oh, did I mention the stunning soundtrack by Trent Reznor (NIN)? Well, if I didn't I should have because I'm going to buy the CD as soon as I've finished this review.This is a very good film indeed. It most certainly justifies a ten rating and I urge you to see it.",10,1,3,17 October 2010
Cinderella Man," A fifteen round cracker
","On a wet Saturday afternoon my 11 year old daughter and I wrestled (no pun intended) between whether to see Cinderella Man or Pride and Prejudice. On the basis that we both loved Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man won and my daughter's boxing education continued. Thank the lord! This movie is the latest in a long line of great boxing movies and threatens my long held opinion that Raging Bull could not be beaten. Whilst a lot more schmaltzy than Raging Bull (although that's a cruel word to use for emotional)it is every bit as convincing in the ring.Russell Crowe has just made his best movie (he way outscores his overbearing performance in A Beautiful Mind). He carries the movie impressively, although he is ably supported by one of America's greatest emerging actors, Paul Giametti. Renne Zellwegger puts in a good shift suitably avoiding the risk of overdoing it.I was close to tears many times and pinned to the back of my seat throughout the boxing bouts. most notably during the movie's rip roaring climax.A great movie.Oh yes, and my daughter now wants to take up boxing.",9,0,0,17 September 2005
Alien: Covenant," Just getting silly now.
","In which a young Michael Fassbender utters the immortal line to his older brother, also played by Michael Fassbender, as he teaches him how to play a penny whistle, 'I'll do the fingering.'Stop. Stop right there.That was silly right?Alien:Covenant is Ridley Scott being let loose on his wildest fantasies and this time it's almost all about religion. He's apparently in thrall with the notion that Aliens are gods or some such claptrap.The name of the ship is 'Covenant', the name of the 'Synthetic' that was on Prometheus but has met its fate and who forms a big part of this movie's plot line was David (Michael Fassbender) and David has lured his ten year the junior 'brother' Walter (also Fassbender) to Prometheus and to seek the fate of the 2,000 'covenanters' on board ship.Although Walter is a more advanced model he is more deeply flawed and has had his emotional intelligence reduced as it became apparent that David was too advanced.Meanwhile, because this is 2017 rather than 1979 special effects, we get to see much more Alien action, which is in itself good (and creepy) but it's OTT and the Aliens as organisms appear less developed because, remember, this is a prequel to Alien and in the time between the two movies the Aliens have evolved.It starts great (but slow) the sets are miraculous and the acting largely decent (Katherine Waterston as Daniels is commendable) but the religious theme becomes more and more overbearing and the relationship between Fassbender and Fassbender is preposterous (although well acted).Although the SFX are great they are just too much and the whole movie descends into a disappointing silly pet project that needs much more script supervision.Not great I'm afraid.",5,5,12,17 May 2017
The Martian," It's OK
","I can't quite whip up the enthusiasm for this movie that many others have. It's fine. Good even. But no more than that. Mars to me looks very, very much like Colorado although it turns out it's Hungary and Jordan in fact. Matt Damon's performance is likable but not endearing and actually I couldn't particularly empathise with anyone in the cast. The major plot 'twist' is predictable.The effects are good but nothing we haven't seen before apart from possibly the opening sandstorm sequence.And then it kind of turns into Gravity. A movie I detested.I didn't detest this but it's a long way down Ridley Scott's list of achievements. In fact I'd rate it below Prometheus, a sadly under-rated movie.Oh, and it's too long.",6,16,34,8 October 2015
Atonement," On the nail
","Atonement is a majestic and moving novel, one of my favourites by one of my favourite authors, so I approached the movie with optimism and trepidation in equal measure.I need not have worried; it is executed with impeccable taste, brilliantly directed, acted, soundtracked and photographed. Surely it will do some damage at the Oscars. It's essentially a caustic attack on the class society in England where the stiff upper lip leads to all sorts of under-the-radar cruelty.James McAvoy (essentially a bit of a Lady Chatterley's lover being as he is the housemaid's son) falls for the toffee-nosed Cecilia Tallis, (Keira Knightley)and, in the process, drives her 13 year old sister into a fit of jealousy that has tragic consequences for McAvoy. This is magnified when the young Brioney (brilliantly played by Saoirse Ronan) acts as go-between between the aforementioned James McAvoy (now certainly one of Britain's best actors) and Knightley (who carries the part off more than adequately).The film is in three acts. The first set in Brideshead Revisited English opulence, the second in Northern France around the D Day landings and containing a 5 minute steadicam tracking shot that takes the breathe away, the third in the suburbs of war torn London.Each is rendered differently and observed immaculately. In the snobbery of pre-war rural England the tension can be cut with a knife and the language and mannerisms of upper class torpor are fantastically realised.The war scenes, aside from the amazing tracking shot, are less well executed (budget restrictions methinks) but the ending is deeply satisfying.Special applause has to be reserved for Dario Mariavrelli's soundtrack which uses the sound of typewriter keystrokes as a hugely original percussion instrument that adds energy to the whole piece.Brilliant.10/10",10,5,12,17 September 2007
