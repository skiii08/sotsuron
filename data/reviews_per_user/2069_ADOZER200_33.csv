Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Pretty Good But Could Have Been Better
",This movie is hard to really talk about. We all knew it wasnt going to be better than the original and it wasnt. I really like Ewan Mcgregor as the part of Obi Wan Kenobi and i liked seeing Liam Neeson playing Qui Gon Jin but i feel that Lucas did not work as hard on this film as he did in the other ones. Ill just tell you one thing COMPUTER ANIMATION SUCKS! I liked it in Toy story and stuff like that but when did Lucas use it in the original. Hardly ever really! I think its ok to have animation used in movies but people over do it nowadays and it looks so fake its not even funny. This is the case here. It as if youre watching a cartoon at times. Which is ok but i went to see star wars and not a cartoon. I thought the story line was all right though. Jar Jar binks they could have done without but i didnt mind him so much either. It was the animation that bugged me. I hope Lucas works a heck of alot harder in the prequels to be because to me its just laziness to use animation instead of frame by frame.,8,0,1,2 May 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," This defines adventure
",This movie is awesome and they will never come out with another one like it. The beginning of this movie is the best of the trilogy. The whole movie is excellent. Even though i think this one isnt as good as the other two i still rate this one very high. I choose Last Crusade over this one because the storyline was better and more creative and Temple of Doom was creepy yet somewhat realistic. This one will not be forgotten though and i highly recommend this one to everyone of all ages. I cant wait until Indiana Jones 4 comes out. I just hope they stick original stuff instead of using too much computer animation like alot of big movie nowadays.,10,0,0,2 May 2002
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Best of the cartoon meets reality movies
","This movie beats any other cartoon meets human movie ever made. I would have to say it also tops any carton movie ever made. The plot is good, the story line is great, it includes almost all cartoon characters. You cant go wrong with this film. This is a top ten movie of mine. I have always loved this movie and i always will love this movie. Years of talk about a sequel made my head turn. Although there probably will never be a sequel, the movie is enough fun to last a lifetime.",10,1,1,4 April 2002
Wayne's World," Ridiculously funny!
",My God this was funny. I laughed my butt off. The first time i saw it i really didnt enjoy it much. To tell you the truth i didnt enjoy this until i was older. I understood alot more and i laughed my tail end off. I went out to go buy it but it was really hard to find at the time. Im glad i have it in my collection. I would not recommend it to an older audience but for the younger viewers you should watch this one. Im sure maybe the older audience would laugh at some stuff too. This one is a good one and Mike Myers did excellent in another role(doesnt he do good in any role though).Well what are you waiting for....GO SEE IT NOW!,8,0,1,2 May 2002
Dawn of the Dead," Can't kill an original
","I saw Dawn of the Dead years ago at a sleep over and I thought it was the greatest zombie flick of all time. This is the movie that got me interested into the horror genre even more than I was. I have seen so many other zombie flicks and not one came close to Dawn of the Dead. Night of the Living Dead and Return of the Living Dead were good and Demons 1 and 2 were pretty awesome, but nothing ever came close to Dawn of the Dead. When I heard about the remake I was exstatic! I was so excited and I couldn't wait. When I finally saw the remake this past weekend it was good but not nearly great like the original. I did not expect too much because of nowadays horror movies but I expected it to be a little better than it was. I thought it was enterataining enough to keep me in my seat but I am not willing to see it again. Fans will be dissapointed because of how much is missing. I would also like to know something else. When did zombies start running marathons???",6,0,0,29 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Remarkable!
","When i went to go see this movie i was excited to see my favorite ride at disneyland come to life. The movie itself was excellent. Johnny Depp stole the whole show as Captain Jack Sparro. Bloom is an up and coming actor people should watch. Kera Knightly is absolutely gorgeous. When she first came out i forgot where i was for a second there. Rush also did a tremendous job as Barbosa. Above all i think this film was great and i definitely recommend it to everyone. The only thing they should have added was a couple more memorable scenes from the ride, but other than that it was awesome!",8,0,1,15 August 2003
Troy," The best movie so far this year!!!
","I would have to say this movie is the greatest movie I have seen in a long time. Most people will kill me for saying this and not putting it down but I thought it was better than Return of the King. I guess it is because I have been a fan since God knows when but I have always enjoyed following this story line. I hope that they have a trilogy because there is so much more that they could do. I am not a Brad Pitt fan however, he plays one of his better roles in this film. The girls are absolutely gorgeous in this film. I cant even begin to tell you who is more beautiful then who. The actor are quite good, but nothing great with the exception of Eric Bana who I thought played a magnificent role. I didn't even recognize it was him. I hope he chooses more roles like this. Wolfgang Peterson does a superb job with the directing. I haven't seen this kind of directing since the olden days. I have beena fan since the Neverending Story. I gave it a 10/10 because I saw Day after Tomorrow before this movie and was unsatisfied. The minute I saw this I was in awe and was good for the night. Go see it if you haven't.",10,3,5,15 September 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," what a way to end a great trilogy!
","This was an absolute great ending to any movie. Many people put it down for not being so great but lets think about this, it had the final battle between Skywalker and Vader, the rebels destroyed the death star,and we visited new places such as Jabas palace and the moon endor and they included many new characters like Jaba, the ewoks, and Emperor Palpatine. Now what more could you ask for in a movie. It was a great and sometime underrated ending to a great trilogy. Not to mention it made more money then Empire Strikes Back. Lets just say its well worth watching over and over again.",10,3,6,2 May 2002
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick masterpeice!
",I got one thing to say...Kubrick!...If you are a big fan of cinematography and the art of a movie than any Kubrick movie will do but this one i one of his better ones next to Shining and Eyes Wide Shut. This is by far the most real war movie you will ever watch next to Saving Private Ryan. The training camp beginning is an excellent way to start out a movie. It has its unexpected twists but it is one great movei that you should not miss. Vincent D'Onofrio does another well performance. Baldwin and Modine also are excellent in the film. Amongst most of the war films this one should be one of your favorites.,8,0,0,4 February 2003
Empire of the Sun," Fine cinematography, mediocre dialogue
",You know the problem with movies today is dialogue. Many film critics and movie goers dont care for many of the movies they make tody because of weak dialogue(and too much computer generated CRAP). Dialogue started growing weaker in the late eighties to the present. This movie is a good example of a good war film and fair enough cinematography but the dialogue is not only lengthy but confusing as well. I somewhat enjoyed the movie but had it been shorter i would have enjoyed it even better. Many movie have a tendency to have too much dialogue. Most of the older films have this and so does this movie.,6,1,5,13 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A great modern classic
","This move definitely is a classic of today. The directing was pure excellence and the special effects are outstanding. I havent seen a movie made this well since the late eighties sometime. I was always thinking that it was about time for them to come out with a fantasy movie. Im not a big fan of the lord of the rings but after seeing this i have to get into it more. The characters were awesome. Whenever every single one of the characters do good then youve got a classic and thats in any movie. They couldnt have chosen a better actor than Elijah Wood to play Frodo. He has the sadness in his eyes and the humble like features that i felt Frodo should have. Ian McKellan did great as Magneto in XMEN but he excelled that part as Gandolf. His true colors came out at the end as showed his true courage against the shadowy fire beast. Sean Astin of course did a good job as always. John Rhyeis Davies did wonderful as the Dwarf. I didnt even recognize him at first. Strider was a very well liked character, id like to see more of him in the sequels and Orlando Bloom played an unforgettable role as an elf. It proves to all of us the cool and determination(and great skill)elves have in battle. Even when the goblins attacked at close range you could see the concentration in his eyes to destroy the creatures. I just have to say this movie was a 10 all the way because of everyones effort they put into it. This is definitely the new trilogy of the century for all of us to enjoy!!!!!!!!!",10,2,2,6 February 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Be a part of the fellowship!
","I have to say when i first saw this movie i liked it but i didnt love it, or at least not yet. I read more about this story and learned about the facts and characters and i have to say i want to see this movie everyday now. It is a classic for our time. This is what working so hard on a film is worth. This can be put amongst the greatest movie of all time and not just in my opinion. I would have to say it is better than Harry Potter or any of the new Star Wars movies. Thats hard for me to say being such a big fan of Star Wars. Ofcourse there are some classics it could never beat like the original Star Wars for example. This definitely is a hard earned film. Props to Peter Jackson for his directing. Ian Mckellan as Gandolf was awesome. I could not think of anyone better for the job. I thought about Christopher Lee but he played well enough as Saramon. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have been two of my favorite actors for years and to see both of them together in one film was good enough for me. When i found out John Rhys Davies played Gimli i flipped out. He is always doing a great job like in Indiana Jones and King Solomons Mines. Im gla to see he is still doing well and actually better than ever. Now Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean im not too familiar with. Bean plays Borimir who is courageous and some what good hearted but coneyving at the same time. I couldnt think of anyone better for that part. Mortensen plays Aragorn(Strider). I think he was an awesome actor in this. Aragorn's performance grows more on me every time i see the movie. My favorite of the whole film was Bloom playing the character Legoles. The old myth of the elf comes to life through this character. I have always studied the myth of the elves and they got it pretty accurate. Featherweight, great senses, ears of a dolphin, nose of a hound, eye of a hawk, eats like a bird, strategic moves, skill with a bow, very feirce and crafty with the blade when they have to be. Above all this movie is amongst my favorites and i cant wait until the whole trilogy comes out.",10,1,1,21 January 2003
Saving Private Ryan," The greatest war movie ever made
","This was one heck of a war movie! I enjoyed every second of it. Tom Hanks does a tremendous performance as always. All the characters played a key role in the movie. One of Vin Diesals first movies too. This movie he could actually act in though. Barry Pepper plays the sniper who does well enough to pull off the job but doesnt quite fit the role to convince me enough but i really liked him in this movie. Giovani Ribisi i feel does the best as the medic. Ribisi needs more exposure and he could win an Oscar one day. I cant find a movie which tops this one off. Enemy at the Gates, Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, and even Full Metal Jacket just didnt quite capture my eye enough to convince me of the reality of war.",10,0,0,4 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Great battle sequences!!!!!!!
",This is by far a very worthy sequel. I saw it as soon as i could. In a way it is better than the original but the original was so great its hard for me to say that. The fighting scenes are awesome. Ive never seen a battle so epic like the final one. Supposedly the battle for middle earth is supposed to be even greater. I cant wait until the last one. Peter Jackson is making a fortune off of these movies. Supposedly he doesnt want to make anymore but you really think i believe that. With all that money id make fifty more. It could be like Star Wars with a prequel. The Hobbit would be the perfect set up. I really believe that in the near future that this book will come to life. The Samarillion is another story. Im not too familiar with this one but i believe it has something to do with Lord of the Rings. That would be a good story to bring to life as well. I would hate to see Lord of the Rings just end. Im sure because of how great the new movie did that Peter Jackson will not pass up on doing the Hobbit even though he says he wont. I always said talk is cheap. Bring on the Hobbit!,10,0,0,21 January 2003
Back to the Future Part III," Time Machine/Cowboy Flick
",I dont believe that alot of viewers enjoyed this one much because of the whole western bit. Well i did. In fact i enjoyed it alot. I thought it was good for the end of the trilogy. Really where else were they going to go? This was actually the first western movie ive seen. I didnt even like westerns at the time but now that im a big fan of the western genre now i enjoy this movie even more. The whole cast did a great job once again playing various roles and the story line was not all that bad either. For all you western haters put there dont watch it but for anyone else give it a shot.,10,1,1,2 May 2002
The Evil Dead," Frightening in a gorish kind of way
",If you dont like horror and gore and the woods at night you might not care for this film too much. I myself love the film. Being a horror movie buff i would hve to recommend tis film. I enjoy it very much. Most people i have seen this movie with jump at he height of a horrifying moment. To most people i saw this with hey told me that evil dead and texas chainsaw massacre were he two scariest movie ive shown them. Ill have to agree. Not only am i into horror movies but i love to hike in the mountains and woods and stay he night in  cabin. I think that is what freaks me out evn more about this film. Sam Raimi has made spider man which is critically acclaimed an so forth but i like his horror movie work a whole lot better. Evil Dead and The Gift were two of my favorites from him. Above all i recommend this film but dont be goin to any cabins anytime soon.,8,0,1,15 August 2003
Big Fish," A Brilliant Masterpeice!
","I loved this movie. Everything about this movie was awesome. It had a little bit of the different Tim Burton moods in it. Some parts were colorful, similar to Pee Wee's Big adventure and Mars Attacks. Some of the scenes were very dark similar to Sleepy Hollow and Batman. I believe Burton is the greatest director of our time. Some may argue the point that Speilberg is the best, but I beg to differ. After Stanley Kubrick passed away I think Tim Burton took the throne as the best director, but i believe that I am the only one who would think so. Hopefully people will begin to realize his brilliance when Charlie and the chocolate factory comes out. Anyways, Ewan Mcgregor was great in the movie and I really liked Albert Finney as well. Hard to believe he was Daddy Warbucks in Annie. Mcgregor's role was just magnificant. He made the story very believable. I hope to see more of him. His roles in trainspotting, star wars, moulin rouge, etc. can not be ignored. I recommend this movie to all people who have a good heart.",10,0,0,28 January 2004
Toy Story," What a classic
",Ive always wondered if my toys came to life when i was a little boy. I guess they do! This movie was awesome. It was really funny but the creativeness of the movie steals the part. Somebody came up with a good story. Very Imaginative. The best part is that it has a worthy sequel that i believe is better but they rate the same because they are both great. It brings back the child in me and i sometime wish i was a child again in this case. This one is great for all ages.,10,1,1,2 May 2002
Toy Story 2," One of those worthy sequels
",This movie is better than its original. Obviously because it is higher rated and it made more money and in my opinion better story. It involved more of th characters other than focusing on the fued between Buzz and Woody. Im sure a third one will be on its way though i havent heard of any franchise being made. You know Dizney though! This is one of the best cartoon movie ever made and it is very original. This is one that defines creative and imaginative.,10,0,1,2 May 2002
A Clockwork Orange," Strange/Satisfying Movie
","Personally this goes without say, the title of the movie is as strange as the movie itself. It was hard for me to firgure out this movie. I enjoyed parts of it but then other parts were somewhat disturbing and confusing. Malcolm McDowell was awesome in the movie. The rest of the actors dont really shine. McDowell does a very convincing job by playing a scumbag of society. I dont think anything is as good as the moral of the whole movie. In fact the moral of the movie is what really makes the movie other than the master art of Kubrick. Dialogue is good as of any of Kubrick's movie but can be somewhat lenghty on some scenes. I would have to say this is one of the strangest movies ive ever seen but it did somewhat make sense to me. I gave it an 8 for cinematography, lighting, dialogue, very original story line, and great role played by McDowell. I cant say i recommend this movie to any movie lover. You have to really understand the deep meaning in this film. Basically if you look at it one dimensionally its saying what goes around comes around.",8,0,0,9 September 2003
Enemy at the Gates," Great Sniper Action
","One of the better more underrated war movies of our time. This one was better than alot of movies made. It was robbed of the number one spot by Exit Wounds which i thought was a very lousy movie. I like Jude Law. He is an awesome actor. He has a lot of potential to be great one day. Rachel Weisz is beautiful in this movie. I totally fell in love with her in this movie. Bob Hoskins plays a general. He does great! You cant even tell its really him underneath his big beard. Ed Harris plays the most outstanding role as a cold hearted, patient yet sadistic sniper. I have never seen anyone get the sniper role down like he does. The smirk and craftiness he carries shows a slight arrogance. His focus is great and his skills with the rifle are unhuman. I believe never to see anyone convince me the way Harris did as a sniper. If youre into the whole sniper bit i recommend this movie to you. The war sequence isnt bad either but it mainly focuses on the two snipers.",7,1,2,4 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Great ending to the greatest sage of all time!
","I thought this movie was great, but not nearly the best. Even though I was as excited as any other fan I did not think that the movie itself was the greatest. I love the lightsaber duels. These are awesome and exciting, but without the fight scenes I don't really see any other memorable scenes. I think the parts with the jedis dying was sad and the ending where they separate the twins and the creation of Darth Vader was disturbing, yet satisfying. I really did enjoy it and i hate to see it end, but a 9 out of 10 is fair and I think it is good enough to go see the movie again and again. Ian McDiarmid does a great job. His role as the emperor is almost so convincing I want to be a part of the dark side. Hayden Christiansen should think twice about giving up acting. He is not the best actor, but his evil transitions are phenomenal. I have not seen too many actors who have done that well with changing to evil so fast. Ewan McGregor was the best. you just like Obi-Wan Kenobi so much more than when we firstgot to know him. Natalie Portman didn't even try. She did almost terrible. If it weren't for her crying scenes I would have topped it as one of the worst acting roles I have seen in a long time. Samuel Jackson just does not convince me in this role still. I think he is one of the greatest actors but he over acts in Star Wars. I forget I'm even watching him. Maybe George Lucas is that bad at writing dialogue. Above all the characters and planets are beyond awesome. The directing is Lucas' best in a long time. The music is good but not memorable. Williams should have come up with some kind of epic anthem for the last film. I thought it was great and I hope this is not the end of a great saga.",9,2,4,20 June 2005
Back to the Future Part II," The best out of the trilogy
",This movie is a classic. One of my top ten movies of all time. The whole trilogy is great. I could never figure out why they never made a trilogy box for this series. This is definetly one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion and in other opinions. Who would've thought a Deolorian could take you so far. The whole trilogy is well thought out and the effects are excellent even for today. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best. I choose the second one over the rest because in a way its sort of like two movies in one and the plan was very well thought out.,10,2,4,4 April 2002
Tombstone," The best western ive ever seen
","Out of the few westerns ive seen this one was by far the best. I enjoyed this movie and i totally didnt think i would. First off im not a big western fan so this made it difficult for me to watch it but after i saw this movie i changed my mind about westerns. I starter watching a bunch of westerns at that time like Silverado, Wyatt Earp, The Magnificent Seven(new version), Bad Girls amongst others and this one beat them all by far. Val Kilmer and Kurt Russel who is one of my favorites did an absolute excellent job. Even though Kilmer's role as Doc Holliday wasnt accurate he created a whole new character for all of us to like. Dennis Quaid was more accurate but not at all as appealing. Kevnin Costner did all right but i didnt care for him as wyatt earp even though i like him i just think that Kurt Russel did a better job. Above all this was a great film and i recommend this to all western go-ers, but be sure to catch wyatt earp as well to get the real scoop on wyatt's life.",10,0,0,30 April 2002
Blade Runner," Not so Great
",I don't know....to all of the fans out there i apologize to them for the stuff that i will be saying about this movie...complete disappointment...i thought i was really going to enjoy this movie...i had great expectations and was waiting to see this for a very long time now...what i got was crap...i did not see any point to this film whatsoever...he acting was good and the originality of the story was good but as far as the ending and the action scenes i just didn't see why everybody thought it was so good...and yes i might be pummeled for saying this...i didn't even think Ford fit the part at all...I'm actually surprised to see this movie rated over some of the other great flicks that are not in he top 250...,4,2,15,14 July 2006
Signs," Creepy Movie but not the Creepiest!
",This movie began to freak me out right at the beginning...i wont mention who or what freaked me out but let me tell you that some of the sppoks in this film are good enough to get you thinking for awhile...when i left the theters i thought that it wasnt all that great of a movie but now to come to think of it i was spooked and im a big time horror movie fan...and some of the events that happen in the movie make sense and really gets you thinking...all of a sudden im creeped out again...i would have to say though that Fire in the Sky was still the best Alien movie...Close Encounters and Alien were excellent as well but i choose Fire in the Sky because it was the most realistic and plus i happen to live in the same state where the incident occured(unfortunately)...but now we are getting off subject...if you want to see a fairly good Alien movie this one is the one to see...and plus alot of this summer's supposed great blockbusters turned out to be duds anyways so you wont be wasting your money...WARNING: if you are scared of aliens all ready...be ready to crap your pants!,7,0,1,21 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," First was better
","This was all around a great film. The graphics were beautiful and the acting superb. I just feel that there was something missing. I guess something didnt meet up to my expectations, but the extended version promises much more deleted scenes. Hopefully that will fullfill my needs. The second film i felt the same way so hopefully they will have more in the extended version. Above all I thought the movei was awesome and I have to give Sean Astin credit for doing what I think was the best out of all the actors. I loved his performance in the movie and hopefully hollywood will realize who the real actors are in stead of these crappy actors like colin farrel or ben affleck. I recommend this film to anyone who is into fantasy adventure type movies.",10,0,1,28 January 2004
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One Two Freddy's Coming For You!
","This film will definitely freak out any horror movie buff. I have always been afraid of the guy. Call me chicken but i hink any grown man would be scared of the unknown. Anyways this film is amongst the great horror movies and i would place it amongst some of the most original movies of all time. The story is great and so is the plot. The acting as always in horror movies is on the downside but you can see a young johnny 'stud muffin' depp starting out so there is another plus. I usually dream of him almost every night. Wet, dirty dreams. I'm not gay but he is the most beautiful man alive, and i love how men look. If you don't like this movie i don't think you like any movies what so ever.",8,0,0,15 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," one of the only very worthy sequels
",This is a great sequel. This movie could actually be proven to be better than its original but then again there is no movie more original than star wars plus it made more money in theaters than the sequels but this movie is definitely worth watching and to anyone who hasnt seen it 'youre missing out'. This movies contains the best scene in the series which includes the part with the AT-AT walkers. The planet Hoth would never again be visited. Hopefully in the prequels to be we will see more of this but above all this is a great movie everyone should enjoy.,10,0,0,2 May 2002
Aladdin," Just an all out great movie
","This movie didn't only entertain us but it made us go back for more. The music is great and the dialogue is put together very well and the moral and plot are very strong as well. It has comedy, drama, action, romance, adventure, mystery, and everything else including in all genres of all movies. I include this to be one of my all time favorites for the fact being that I went to the theaters 3 times to see it and I could not stop watching it on video after. One of my top ten best Disney movies...hands down! I definitely recommend this movie to all Disney fans and to anyone who has not seen it yet because honestly you are missing out on one of the greatest animation movies ever filmed. I especially love the nude scenes with the genie and aladdin.",10,1,1,7 October 2004
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The ultimate adventure!!!!!!
","This movie is an instant recommendation to anyone of all ages. Even though I love the whole trilogy I would have to choose this one as the best and many people I know agree with me. The beginning and the ending to the whole trilogy is the best but the ending to this one had the most creative and well thought out plan. Excellent action in this movie too, it doesn't stop for Harrison Ford. This movie has everything you would want any adventure movie to have in it...you name it. This is within my top ten movies of all time.",10,1,1,4 April 2002
Back to the Future," Original Classic
",This movie deserves to be amongst the classics. Michael J. Fox did outstanding and who could ever forget Christopher Lloyd in his role as Doc. He made me think that there actually was a real Doc. Both actors are excellent along with Crispin Glover playing George McFly. Glover does very well in his roles. I would like to see him in better movies. I chose the sequel over the original though. The reason being that the sequel involved new stuff and a bit of the original stuff. This movie should not be forgotten. There wont be one like it. Im surprised the delorium wasnt sold out at the time. were they that badly made?,10,2,3,2 May 2002
The Godfather," This is an offer you cant refuse!
","I loved this movie. I always used to think it was over-hyped but i finally watched the entire movie in whole not too long ago and i totally see why everyone has been raving about it for years. I also watched other mafia movies such as Scarface, Goodfellas, and Casino and none of them even compared to the great godfather. I honestly cannot say who does better in this movie Brando's character is one for the ages, Pacino is so convincing it gives me chills, Cahn's character is played so well you cant even explain why you like the guy so much, and Duvall is magnificent as the cool under fire lawyer. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out...i know i was.",10,0,3,29 September 2004
