The Lobster," I can only blame myself for watching this through
",It was somewhat entertaining however there were no monumental scenes. The end of the movie is what made this so horrible. It's as if they ran out of money and couldn't finish filming. I don't get it.,3,0,1,10 May 2020
Don Jon," Previews didn't do it justice
","This movie gives an amazing lesson. I wish the previews didn't make it look so corny. Jon learned a lesson in life and it changed him for the better. There were a lot of funny parts in the movie. It takes you through the life of a typical 'clubber' but in real life most of these guys never grow up & become REAL MEN. This movie is different. I've been there before but I, like Jon, realized it was OK to say goodbye to the club scene when I found happiness elsewhere & the few friends that respected my decision were the ONLY ones that mattered.",8,1,1,6 May 2019
War Machine," Quite uninteresting
","This was a boring, uneventful movie. It was difficult watching Brad Pitt portray somebody who is constantly making weird facial expressions. He was constantly struggling with it. Not sure what that was all about. There honestly were no eventful scenes. Usually a movie sends a clear message about something. This movie sent you home with nothing worth remembering. There was no war and there was no machine. The title exaggerates what is really taking place in this movie.",3,2,3,10 May 2020
