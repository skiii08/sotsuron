3:10 to Yuma," A Modern Western Unleashed
","I love it when I can leave a movie theatre and really feel like I got my $11 worth. Trust me, with 3:10 To Yuma you leave feeling like you got at least $22 out of the experience. Everything from the acting to the cinematography, to the score were superb. Many, many, accolades to both Christain Bale and Russell Crowe, both did an outstanding job playing opposite each other. Also, my hats off to Peter Fonda as well for playing a righteously despicable bounty hunter. 3:10 is a perfect rendition of an old western short story, that's brought into the modern age by it's amazing ability to capture the imagery and setting of the 'old west' time period. The shots and the quality of the film create an aesthetic this genre's predecessors from the 1950's and 60's were not able to capture. This element helps the audience to more realistically than ever be able to pit themselves in the untamed west, see the sunsets, feel the snow and the cold, taste the dirt, and smell the gun powder. Go see it.",10,8,16,17 September 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," wow (i'd use caps, but the IMDb police said i couldn't shout)
","Caught the 12:01am showing at the Arclight in Hollywood to a sold out theatre. Initial thoughts: WOW!! For once a trilogy that's actually good from start to finish and gets progressively better from one installment to the next. This is this summer's quality flick from the big studios! Go see it and enjoy the feeling of being fulfilled when the credits roll. -That's really all i wanted to say, but again the police/guidelines enjoy and support long winded rants and it wouldn't let me go without a minimum of ten lines. So there goes my short and sweet comment. Now I have to think of things to type, however, this is a daunting task, if you read the first line you can understand I was up pretty late. Now I'm tired, at work, and my brain is not very forthcoming this morning in terms of coming up with material to type about. Oh yeah, this movie's great!!!",10,1,5,3 August 2007
The Dark Knight," Gritty & Unapologetic
","It took me until I woke up this morning to realize the awesomeness of this picture, which I saw last night at midnight. Without spoiling anything, just know that this movie is gritty and complex with a huge amount of depth in both the plot and the characters. It's extremely uncompromising as far as how one would think a major studio would handle a major comic book hero franchise. Most superhero/comic book movie plots' are set up for the sole purpose of creating a franchise and selling it to death. This is the opposite (not saying the conclusion doesn't beg for more answers, story & resolution). However, it's extremely unapologetic in the plot and characters and just goes in ways that you wouldn't expect a comic book movie to go. It's mature and adult like, you forget it is even a comic book movie. It's in your face from the moment it starts until the after the credits roll. The 2 1/2 hour runtime appears long, but the plot captivates you from the start and won't let you go. There's nothing that can be cut away from this film, as it would undermine the complexity and richness of the plot and characters.Ledger is better than you could have imagined, as is Eckhart! Bale, Oldman, Caine, Freemon...amazing!! Go see this movie. It is the best film of the last two years and one of the best of all time!!",10,3,7,18 July 2008
