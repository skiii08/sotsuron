The Incredible Hulk," Good effort, though not the quality of the '03 version
","This is a good comic adaptation, period. There's action, the plot line is simple but effective, a little depth, it has all the necessary ingredients. Yet, it didn't live up to the underrated inaugural effort. The primary reason is the aforementioned depth. Lee's version possessed more heart than was anticipated by the average moviegoer and, thus, was met with mixed reviews. This isn't really to blame of the moviegoers who, perhaps, simply wanted more Smash with their Hulk. Had the original been received as a drama, as was intended by Lee and his longtime screenwriter, Jim Shamus, I believe it would have been appreciated much more.I think the recasts in Incredible Hulk were a mistake, and feel that Bana, Connelly, & Elliot were all superior in the same roles. However, this may simply be a matter of personal taste. At this point, I feel I am making too many comparisons to the first effort that are unnecessary. Back to this film, the effects are good. The problem with Hulk CGI lies in facial expressions and muscle definition. With such Marvel films as Spider-Man and Ironman this point is moot, because both heroes wear masks and suits thus such things are unnecessary. However, with Incredible Hulk, the effects are, well, effective.As was aforementioned, this is a solid comic adaptation. I consider Incredible Hulk on par with Ironman. This is a fine way to spend an afternoon. Cheers.",6,3,7,14 June 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great ride
","What fun I had at this movie!  The whole experience, from the crowd cheering and excitement as the words 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away' appeared, to the music, the opening scenes as Qui Gon and Obi Won battled the droids, to the escape of Queen Amidala, to the pod racing, to the unleashing of Darth Maul, to the climatic fight, etc., etc.!  This was a great time.  I hear some complain that it wasn't anything like the first Star Wars, A New Hope.  Well, of course not!  Had it been, everyone would have complained that all they did was try to recapture the magic of the first movie!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone, any age, anywhere!",9,33,52,12 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Complete entertainment
","I must admit, I left the theatre wondering if there was anything else I could ask for in a film.  I could think of nothing.  Though I have always enjoyed the Star Wars saga, I consider myself difficult to please in regards to films.  I found this film had everything I enjoy in entertainment: great characters, solid plot-line, brilliantly choreographed action sequences, a very human element, love.  This is a fantastic film.  Better yet, the Star Wars story just keeps getting better and better.  The highest recommendation.  Go have a blast.  Cheers.",10,0,0,17 May 2002
Pitch Black," Some pretty good action
","I knew nothing about this movie when a friend dragged me off to see it. But I must admit, it wasn't half bad!  It made for a pretty good action flick. The 'alien' angle has been done to death, and originality is now hard to come by.  While Pitch Black is certainly no 'Predator' or 'Aliens', it is an admirable effort.",6,0,0,15 September 2000
Apocalypse Now," Redux version
","Frankly, this film is quite over-rated.  I've not seen the original, so I may only comment on the Redux version.  Three and a half hours...I'm thinking the film was better without all the extra footage.  There's usually a reason some scenes end up on the editing room floor.  And I could see several that deserved it in this version.  This movie is just plain boring. Call it method film making, whatever, it's a snoozer.  This film is considered a classic, but not by me.  I waited 23 years to see it, and I wasn't missing much.",4,3,11,24 June 2002
Spider-Man," Pleasantly surprised
","I admit I wasn't expecting too much, but was quite happy with the film. More so than most recent superhero stories, Spider-Man made much more of an effort at back-story and character development, which I appreciate.  The casting was appropriate, and I was very pleased all the acting.  Maguire portrayed the nerdy Parker and Spider-Man quite well.  Kirsten Dunst's performance of the 'girl-next-door' was pleasing.  Though I wonder if Maguire ever really had to put on the suit until the ending, so much Spider-Man action was CGI!  And worthy of note, my nephews (9 and 6) were thrilled with the movie, so everyone was happy!",8,0,0,6 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Another epic dud
","This is not a great film, this is a Hollywood cash-cow.  Meant not to be historically accurate, but rather, simple, bloated entertainment.  It's not as terrible as Titanic, but not too far off.  How far has Hollywood sank when they package movies obviously targeted for teenage girls in such lavish wrapping?  How unfortunate that there are still a few poor souls, who survived that horrific ordeal, alive to witness this disgusting portrayal which is destined to become it's legacy in the eyes of this young generation.  Hmmm, I should say something nice...okay, good special effects.",4,1,2,11 December 2001
The Mist," Leading candidate for worst film of 2007
","Let me preface this brief review by stating that I have not read the King novella, so I have no literary comparison. Let me also state that I rarely rate films to either extreme, low or high. In my decade on IMDb, I have only rated five films with a 1/10, a list of the worst films of said decade, indeed, some of the worst films I have ever seen. Well, make that six films. The Mist is an intensely stupid and insipid film. It's fan rating of 7.9, at the time of this writing, speaks only to American stupidity. In short, the screenplay was more humorous than frightening, but humorous in a sad, pathetic way. The characters in the film were also jocular, acting (as do characters in just about every horror film) in ridiculous, pitiful ways to their circumstances. The only redeeming moment in the entire film is when the moronic Ms. Carmody was finally dispatched, all too late. In short, unless the holiday season vomits out another truly idiotic effort, The Mist will easily rank (literally) as the worst film of the year. 1/10, avoid this movie like the plague, it's two hours of your life you will never get back.",1,4,14,1 December 2007
Driven," Driven? Drivel.
","Oh...my...god, what a bad film this is.  The story is recycled and the action effects are horrible.  Let's face it, I knew I was in trouble as soon as I saw Renny Harlin's name during the opening credits.  Stallone complains that he gets no good roles from Hollywood, anymore.  Well, if this is an indication of the product he brings, no wonder.  What a terrible film.  Stay away!  Play with your kids!  Take you dog to the park!  Do anything but watch this junk!  You've been warned.",2,3,8,28 September 2001
Million Dollar Baby," Good, but not great film
","Million Dollar Baby is getting a lot of press, and not completely undeservedly so. It's certainly not a mainstream film, perhaps even more distressing than Closer. As one would expect, the movie is brilliantly acted and directed with much skill. Once again watching Eastwood and Freeman play off of one another is a treat, and Hilary Swank excels as well. Million Dollar Baby is, throughout most of the film, understated. The poverty level of the bulk of the characters is done so with subtlety, though it cannot be ignored. The touch of Freeman's narration being a letter to Eastwood's daughter is well done.The most glaring issue with the film is the reality of the fight scenes and, particularly, the illegal shots by the character named 'Blue'. As many likely know, numerous illegal tactics may be employed in small club fights. However, the tactics that Blue employed were supposed to be taking place in sanctioned, championship level matches. That is terribly unrealistic. World championship sanctioned bouts are held under a microscope. Aside from the referee there are judges at ringside and officials from the boxing commission. Blue would have long been disqualified and/or suspended for her continued illegal actions. A shot like the one she threw at Swank's character going unrecognized in a championship level bout would be not unlike had the BC ignored Tyson biting off Holyfield's ear. Aside from that, as skilled a manager as Eastwood's character was supposed to be and having already acknowledged Blue's many illegal tactics, I imagine he'd have advised his fighter, 'This is a cheap shot artist, you don't take your eyes off of her until her ass is sitting on that stool!' Those flaws are not meant to detract from the telling of a story, however. The ending of the film and Maggie's eventual death are a bit overdrawn. Nonetheless, the story is well told and the focus of the relationship between Eastwood and Swank is far from lost. All in all, this is a good film. 6/10.",6,2,6,7 February 2005
The Insider," Very high quality flick
","This movie is very, very good.  When I read that it was 2 1/2 hrs, I thought, 'Oh, no, boooring.'  But first off, this movie is so interesting that it didn't seem much longer than the typical 90 minute flick.  And as many dramas are, this film may be a little slow in some parts, but I never lost interest, not once.  Crowe was great, and I was impressed by Pacino's performance, who I've admittedly lost confidence in over the last decade or so.  Probably his best in many years.  Granted, most 'based on a true story' films fictionalize 90% of the film (i.e. Titanic, Perfect Storm), but this movie was still loyal to the basic truths.  Very compelling, go rent this one soon.",8,0,0,21 December 2000
Toy Story 2," A good sequel
","I rarely say this, but this sequel was very good.  Of course, like most, it isn't as good as the original, but this one is certainly a great effort. All of the wonderful characters from the first Story are here, as well as some new ones.  This movie is funny and touching.  It manages to give depth and feeling to animated toys, whereas most films fail to do so with live action actors!  Go rent this one, whether you have kids or not.",8,0,1,30 October 2000
Casino," Brings back memories
","Casino is an excellent and very accurate portrayal of events that shape a part of the recent history of Las Vegas. For those of us who have been in Las Vegas for the last 30 years or more, we well remember Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal (portrayed in the film as Sam 'Ace' Rothstein), the diminutive but brutally violent Anthony 'The Ant' Spilotro (Nicky Santoro), casino front man Alan Glick (Philip Green), and the early days of the Stardust Hotel (The Tangiers). We also recall Spilotro's crew, 'The Hole in the Wall Gang' who, as depicted in the film, were notorious for jewelry store heists wherein their method of entry was, yes, drilling holes in the walls. Rosenthal ran more than one casino at the height of his authority, including the Fremont, Hacienda, and Marina Hotels.Of course, the time lines in the film have been doctored a bit for the sake of story-telling. For instance, the man (named Bill McCarthy) who's head Spilotro (Santoro) put in a vise and tightened to the point of popping an eye out of it's socket actually occurred back in Chicago, prior to Spilotro being sent to Vegas to protect Rosenthal and the Stardust's skim. Incidentally, Spilotro was first sent to Miami to function in the same capacity of protecting Rosenthal. In the film, Santoro's reputation was primarily built through the torture and murder of the fella in the vise. In reality, Spilotro's reputation was well in place, at least among the wise guys, by the time he arrived in Las Vegas. As for Rosenthal, we remember his awful television show after his first tangle with the GCB although, to this day, Lefty emphatically denies ever juggling on the show as Deniro did in the movie! Though, another truth in the film, once the increasingly power-hungry and reckless Spilotro became involved with Rosenthal's wife, Geri (Ginger in the movie), things were already going downhill. In 1986, the bodies of Anthony and Michael Spilotro were found buried in an Indiana cornfield. They had been bludgeoned to near-death prior to being buried. The amount of dirt in their lungs indicated they had been buried alive. Geri Rosenthal was, indeed, found dead in a California motel from a 'hot load', a drug overdose. Alan Glick still resides in California (if memory serves) in a well fortified residence, likely still wary of retribution for his role, ignorance aside, in the downfall of the enterprise.Nicholas Pileggi got a lot of it right, as did Martin Scorsese. Casino is a great film. It was an extremely interesting time in Las Vegas in the 70's and 80's, one that I am not likely to ever forget.

The Replacements," Pleasantly surprised
","I'm skeptical of most sports movies, most are clichÃ©d and unoriginal. But The Replacements soon had me laughing, and it kept me laughing throughout the entire movie. Keanu Reeves is normally a terrible actor, but this was, by far, his best performance (though that's no great feat). Brooke Langton was simply radiant; beautiful, smart, and sexy. The supporting cast was very good, especially the fellow who plays the Welsh kicker, he provides the best comic moments. I also like the fact that there was no reference to any existing NFL teams. All the team names were generic. A nice touch. All in all, this one should have you laughing a lot.",8,1,2,15 September 2000
Rock Star," So it had a few clichés...
","Nonetheless, this was a pretty good film. Yes, the garage band (or porn house basement band, in this case) rocker gets his shot at the big time, then falls into the abyss of excess, i.e. the rock star life. But the way he left the band was unforeseen, despite the fore-shadowing of Mats' story of his marriage. And the film then illudes to bigger things for Chris Cole as he ends up in Seattle playing with shorter hair and wearing plaid. Perhaps he rides the wave that bridges 80's hair metal to 90's Seattle scene 'grunge' rock. At any rate, that Chris ends up with Emily makes a big difference in the reconciliation of his personal journey, as if there were another possibility (though Hollywood does occasionally try to throw a curve our way, once a decade or so). I liked this movie, and though he's yet to show real versatility, Wahlberg lends his innate likability to every role he assumes. I also hope that Aniston's continued ventures onto the big screen bring her increased success. She's a rare thing: a beauty with talent.",6,1,2,3 March 2002
High Fidelity," Cusack is hilarious
","I have liked Cusack ever since he started with the bit parts in the John Hughes coming-of-age films, like Weird Science.  Then he did the silly flicks like Better Off Dead and Sure Thing, which were amusing, as well.  He nearly always plays a likeable fellow, one of the guys you hung out with in high school.  And this is no exception.  This is a fresh, witty film about the joys and troubles of relationships.  We've all been there, and probably have more in store.  The way the film relates these relationship trials to the audience is it's most valuable attribute.  It's nice to know that I'm not the only one who's had relationship trouble!  Definitely worth the price of rental.",8,0,1,19 September 2000
