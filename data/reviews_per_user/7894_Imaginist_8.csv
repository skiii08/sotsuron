Casablanca," Casablanca (5/5)
","'Casablanca' is a film that came out in 1942--a time of war and uncertainty. Nobody knew who was going to win the big one, and I believe that is the reason 'Casablanca' became so popular and has remained so popular ever since. This film is about sacrifice--about doing the right thing even if it is at the expense of one's own happiness. 'Casablanca' takes place in Morocco towards the beginning of WWII. At this time the Nazis had captured France, but Morocco, a French colony, was still considered to be free; however, Nazi influence over the nation was growing ever more. In fact, it could easily be said that Morocco had become a Nazi puppet nation. It is in this atmosphere that we meet Rick (Bogart in his greatest role), a cynical night club owner who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. We soon learn that his miserable outlook on life was caused by a woman named Ilsa (played brilliantly by Bergman) who had jaded him long ago. It is here in Casablanca that Rick plans on spending the rest of his days in isolation--his love of life has been sucked right out of him. However, Rick's world soon comes crashing down when Ilsa comes walking into his 'gin joint' with her husband Victor (Paul Henreid). Victor is a part of the French Underground and is on the run from the Nazis; his escape route led him directly to Casablanca where he is now searching for two visas to America: one for him and one for Ilsa. In an ironic twist of fate, Rick happens to come across two visas when a friend of his, played by Peter Lorre, gives them to him to hide. Lorre's character was supposed to sell these very visas to Victor and Ilsa, and had arranged for a meeting at Rick's bar. Unfortunately, Lorre's character is arrested and thus Rick gets the visas. However Rick does not realize that these visas are for Ilsa and her husband, and Ilsa does not realize that the bar belongs to Rick, so when they meet it is by complete chance. Soon enough, Victor and Ilsa learn that it is Rick who has the visas and thus they try to persuade him to sell the visas to them. Rick is still bitter about being jaded by Ilsa long ago and therefore refuses to give them any such pleasure--Rick wants revenge. However Ilsa plans to persuade Rick, and in doing so she falls back in love with him--she is prepared to leave Victor for Rick, so long as Rick agrees to give Victor the visa. Rick agrees to the terms, and we soon have an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. This good man, Victor, may be getting a visa, but he is loosing a wife, and we know from Rick's experience that when people suddenly loose lovers they also loose their interest in life, and Victor cannot afford to give up his fight against the Nazis. It is here we see Rick's true character shine through all the cynicism; he engineers a plot that ensures that both Victor AND Ilsa get on that plane to America. Rick not only gives up any chance of getting out of Casablanca, but he also gives up Ilsa so that Victor may have her and that the both of them may continue their valiant underground fight against the Nazis. Rick also realizes that Casablanca has become too dangerous a place for Ilsa, and at the same time too dangerous a place for him as he is going to be punished for helping Victor, who is an enemy of the Nazis. Rick is prepared to sacrifice everything for a cause larger than himself, and that is why this film was so appropriate for the time in which it was made. 'Casablanca' reminded America that they were now in a war and that sacrifice was going to be necessary of everyone--even those who wanted nothing to do with the world. Rick is the kind of person that we should all regard as a hero, for he puts aside his bitterness and even his own happiness for the sake of something vastly more important. Rick ensures that one of the underground movement's most valuable figures escapes the Nazis grip. However, Rick needed some inspiration in order to perform this valiant act. I believe that he was inspired by Victor, and came to realize that this man was an incredible human being. I also believe that Rick comes to realize that true love is doing what is best for a person, and not what is best for one's self, and thus he gives Ilsa up in order to ensure her safety. Rick was inspired by both patriotism and his devout love to Ilsa. Although Rick's actions may have been the result of some inspiration, they too would come to affect someone else: the chief of the French police in Casablanca (played wonderfully by Claude Rains). Here is a man who hates the Nazis but obeys their commands because it is in his best interest. However, when Claude's character sees the valiant actions of Rick, he too decides to denounce the Nazis. Besides the wonderful message and a host of intriguing characters such as Rick, 'Casablanca' offers so much more: wonderful lighting, cinematography and acting, suspense, drama, romance, and some of the best lines ever written. Even the end of the movie is more than just a message; it also leaves us with a bitter-sweet taste, as Rick receives nothing and gives up everything. As stated, this was the kind of sacrificial attitude needed during WWII, and it is an attitude that continues to ring loud and clear throughout all desperate times. 'Casablanca' deserves and receives: 5 out of 5 stars.Copyright 2006 Imaginist",10,0,2,18 February 2006
Fight Club," Fight Club (3/5 stars)
","For those who are picky this could have spoilers. So if you don't want an in depth look at the details then move on.Synopsis: 'Fight Club' is a movie that reminds me of a beautiful train heading for an unbeknownst yet impending doom. It starts off promising, everyone is excited about the journey that lies ahead, and the train's grace and splendor is so inviting (a.k.a the witty dialogue and Norton's narration has set us up for quite a ride). Then with out warning the engineer (a.k.a the writer) picks up the train's speed and it continues to accelerate down the track until a marvelous crash, which leaves us wondering as to what happened? The problem with 'Fight Club', as in so many movies, is not the first half but the last half; in fact, the first part of the movie excellent. Edward Norton is a down and out guy so upset with his life that his only perk (and only way to sleep) is to go to different support groups (i.e. 'Smoker's Anonymous,' 'Men With Testicular Cancer,' etc.) and wallow in other people's misery. Unfortunately for Ed's character, a very strange woman, Marla, comes along and ruins his fun, for she is doing the same exact thing he is. In an amusing scene, Ed's character and Marla decide to split up the support groups so that they do not have to cross each other's paths. Well, after this bit all seems well for Ed until he meets a very strange, machoistic, and aggressive guy named Tyler (Brad Pitt). Eventually Ed's character befriends Tyler and the two of them start a fight club to get there aggression out on each other and anyone else who would like to join. This is where the movie begins to deteriorate. Ed's character and Tyler start the club so that they can get their lives back on track (or at least this is true for Ed's character), and it works--everything seems a-OK after a few brawls with the locals. Now what does this tell us? That violence will make everything alright? It seems to me that the latter is the message, and I have a problem with that because violence never solves anything. Well anyway, after Tyler and Ed's character start the club they begin 'Project Mayhem' which is an underground terrorist group made up of working class guys who want to attack consumerism. This is where our train has gone off the tracks. When I was watching the film I felt like the writer suddenly had no where else to go with his original ideas except to create a bunch of terrorists, which looking back on it, is quite laughable. The end of the movie is rather good except for a few spots, but I will not go into that because it would spoil some big secrets. I guess the real problem I had with this movie was the 'why?' Why the hell did a writer sit down one day and decide to write a story condoning violence yet denouncing consumerism? You see, the problem is that this movie becomes a bit of a paradox; it tells us to not buy into materialism because it is superficial and unneeded (which by the way I agree with), but at the same time it tells us to use fist fights and terrorism as a means to achieve our goals (which is just so much more logical then buying into materialism--our we honestly suppose to believe this junk?). It seems to me that the writer was just another crazed radical who so happened to have some good ideas for a movie. Don't get me wrong, 'Fight Club' is a fairly good movie filled with originality, but it just really doesn't have a worthwhile point. For the above reasons I am giving 'Fight Club': 3 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic",7,0,1,21 March 2005
Citizen Kane," Citizen Kane (5/5)
","'Citizen Kane' has often been called the greatest film in cinematic history, and with good reason: it is a stroke of genius on the part of Orson Welles. He was only 25 when he directed this film, and yet he pioneered some of the most amazing cinematography and production techniques of his day or any other. At a first glance, 'Kane' is a rather simple story: a young boy, Charles Foster Kane (played wonderfully by Orson Welles) inherits a large fortune and winds up dying alone and unhappy--his last words being the infamous 'rosebud.' Although it seems like a rather cut and dry endeavor, it is so much more than that, mainly because the film is done in flashbacks. We begin with Kane's death and then move backwards and forwards through his life, in an attempt to find out what 'rosebud' means. This is brilliant editing on Welles part; he takes a simple story and creates a complex mesh. Through these many flashbacks we slowly but surely begin to learn of Kane and those around him, and this creates quite the portrait. Welles almost always shoots Kane and other strong characters from a low angle, making them appear lager than life--this especially aids in the character development of Kane. Before this film, using camera angles in such a way was scarcely heard of, but here we see a new technique:Welles shows us that angles can do more than just make a movie look'pretty.'Another fascinating technique Welles employs for character development is set design. Whenever Kane is present, it seems that the ceilings are lower, for examples one should look at Kane's publishing house, and some of the rooms in his mansion. This further demonstrates Kane's massive size and power, and at the same time higher ceilings are used when more inferior characters are used. For example, a newspaper reporter interested in solving the mystery of rosebud, is first shown in a great hall looking at some old records and memoirs belonging to Kane's old guardian, Mr. Thatcher. Because of this we recognize that this reporter is not important, but rather only secondary. Also, Kane's second wife is often sitting in the largest rooms the Kane mansion, which makes her look rather small. However, the best example of how Welles uses set pieces to enforce Kane's power is when he is running for governor. Here, Kane makes a speech to a very large crowd, and behind him is a mammoth picture of himself. Of course, what is also amazing about this scene is that Welles discovers a new technique called deep focus: he is able to simultaneously keep the large picture and Kane in focus, giving the illusion of depth. After this speech Kane is all set to win the governor's race, but through a twist of some dirty politics, he looses, and soon after, his first wife leaves him. Of course, to anyone paying attention this comes as no surprise--we know there has been distance between Kane and his wife for quite some time. However, we do not receive this information through dialog but rather through Welles brilliance use of subtlety. Welles shows us several scenes of the couple sitting together and having breakfast. Each breakfast encounter comes and goes with great speed leading into a dissolve which then takes us to another breakfast meal. We see the couple slightly bickering, but the way Welles shoots the scene it looks as though they are still eating breakfast right next to each other, which does not usually indicate tension. However, the last frame of this breakfast montage shows a wide shot of the couple, and we see them sitting at a much bigger table then they were first sitting at, and they are also sitting directly opposed to each other. This part of the film tells us a wealth of information, and all because of a set piece (a table), the clever use of editing, and the camera placement. No other film maker before or since this movie has used these technical aspects to flesh out so many details, not only about the characters, but about the story.The amazing thing about Welles is how much information he is able to convey using subtlety and some simple yet poignant dialogs. Welles does not hit the viewer in the face with his film like so many movies in this day and age (i.e. anything done by Michael Bay), but instead he opts for letting the audience come to their own conclusions. And when I had mulled over this film, the conclusion I came to was rather depressing: Charles Foster Kane had all the money and power in the world but this could not buy him love, and like most of us, he never comes to realize that simple fact, which in the end left him bitter and lonely. Thinking about all of this was rather heart wrenching, but what really drove it home was when I came to discover the meaning of 'rosebud': it was one of Kane's childhood toys. That to me is most upsetting of all: the only time Kane was ever truly happy was when he was a child--when he was free from his wealth.Kane could have said or thought of anything in the world on his deathbed, but instead he chose to reflect on his short-lived childhood. Now if that doesn't get you misty eyed, not much else will. I recommend 'Citizen Kane' to any mature person looking for a deep and intricate film, in which there is much more than there first appears. However, it is probably wise to watch the movie twice, in order to discover all the little and large things Orson Welles so masterfully paints on his canvas of celluloid. All and all I give 'Citizen Kane': 5 out of 5 stars.Copyright 2006 Imaginist",10,7,10,18 February 2006
Closer," Closer (4/5 stars)
","Synopsis: This is the story of four individual who cross paths, cross lovers, and ultimately screw themselves (and let me tell you: that is totally Nichol's element). It begins with Dan (Law) and Alice's (Portman) chance meeting, and soon enough they fall in love. Of course this does not last long because a photographer, Anna (Roberts), catches the eye of Dan and thus they have an affair. Shortly after this Daniel decides to tell Alice of the affair and he does it with such dry emotion that one cannot help but think he is the scum of the earth. However, he is not alone, Anna decides to tell her husband, Larry (Owen), that she has been having the affair as well. This scene is even more gut-wrenching. The betrayal and deception that occurs between these people is so incredible hurtful that it even grazes the viewer. Anyway, Alice decides to revert back to her old ways and join a strip club again. As fate would have it the distraught Larry shows up at this very strip club. Alice and Larry decide that perhaps it would be beneficial if they had a 'go' at it, and not too mention it would definitely hurt their ex-lovers. And that is what this whole film is about: lovers turning into haters (I know that sounds ghetto but it's true). Almost everyone knows what it is like to be betrayed by a close loved one and the feelings of revenge that go with it. The only difference between us and the people in this film is that that these people decide to actually extract this vengeance. Well, oddly enough Anna leaves Dan and goes back to Larry, but Alice remains at the strip club. As one can imagine, Daniel is completely broken by this and so he confronts Larry about Anna: he wants her back. It is here that Larry tells him to go back to Alice, and so he tells Daniel where he can find her. Dan is overjoyed by Larry's display of compassion and thanks him for disclosing Alice's location. It is here where I found to be one of the cruelest things throughout the whole movie. Just before Dan leaves, Larry stops him and tells him with pride that he slept with Alice; Dan is devastated. The viewer suddenly feels the deception that Dan felt: Larry appeared to be so forgiving and so nice, and like Dan we forgive him, but when he utters this, we want to cry with Dan. Why on earth would Larry tell Dan this?! Simple: he wants revenge, and it is this revenge that shows us how cruel humans can be. At any rate Dan and Alice never really do get back together (although they do try), and Anna and Larry remain married. And that is the end of the movie. So what do we have to take away from it? Well, many things but what I took away was that love hurts and if we are not careful we can ruin the blessings that are bestowed upon us. These characters will never be the same again (even though Anna and Larry salvaged their marriage one can tell that the love they used to have is gone), and yet at one time they had everything they could have wanted. So why did these people do these things to each other? Well, it was a combination of: lust, jealousy, and rage. Those three little words ruined the lives of four people, and we as the viewer should always remember this. Because if there is anything a great movie like 'Closer' can do, it is to have us take a second look at what we have and either try to change it or be thankful for it. In my opinion this film does the latter, and I couldn't be happier for the reminder. I really enjoyed this cathartic experience and therefore I will give 'Closer': 4 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic",8,0,0,8 April 2005
Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver (5/5 stars)
","Synopsis: 'Taxi Driver' is a character study, and oh what a character study it is. Robert DeNiro is brilliant as Travis Bickle, a NYC taxi driver, who I found to be an OK guy even though he made some stupid decisions. This is probably the crux of the film: we have a guy who tries to do the right thing, but his faults prevent him from always doing so. For example, Travis meets this new foxy lady, played by Cybill Shepard, and takes her out to see a porno for their second date. I don't believe he intentionally meant to offend her, but he does, and it costs him their relationship. It is rather unfortunate considering how happy she made him. Another reason I find Travis to be an alright guy is even after this he tries to make amends with her, but to no avail. I suppose here in lies the problem with Travis: his faults cloud his true character and this causes him to be isolated from others. Although Travis is the result of much of his loneliness I don't believe that he intentionally brings it upon himself--he just isn't very bright. Intelligence may not be Bickle's strong point, but anger and loneliness sure are--Travis becomes not only angry with himself, but angry with the world (as is exampled by his subtle racism), and in fact, he blames the world for all his troubles. Travis is tired of being lonely and ignored--Travis wants to be noticed; he wants to be somebody (wouldn't we all under the circumstances?). Therefore Bickle decides to assassinate a political figure in order to get his old girl friend's (Shepard) attention, as she was working on his campaign. However, when this plot fails to come to fruition Travis makes a last ditch effort to make something of himself--he decides to rescue a child hooker he befriended (played by a wonderful Jodie Foster) from the pimps who enslaved her. This is another reason I found Travis to be good person underneath the rough exterior: although he is tempted to sleep with the girl he doesn't, and instead tries to convince her to leave prostitution. If Travis was truly a monster he would have taken advantage of his young friend, but instead, he displays a higher moral fortitude, which shows that he is capable of being a good guy. Travis successfully frees the young hooker (by killing off the pimps) and surprisingly, he gets the attention he desires. This ending is simply incredible--it is brutally violent, and quite shocking. Although Travis does free the prostitute, we also know that he should not be considered the hero he is made out to be--after all, he freed Jodie's character for his own deranged desires of recognition and attention. 'Taxi Driver' is an incredibly complicated story that demands great attention. It shows us both sides of Travis Bickle: his good side, and then his deranged crusade for self serving glory. Although I could have become angry with Travis, and hated him, I could not bring myself to do so. I felt sympathetic towards him. When I got right down to it, he was a sick and lonely man, who was incredibly desperate. This film shows us how desperate situations can create desperate people, and sometimes, these people finally snap. The other aspect of 'Taxi Driver' that dazzled me was how well this film also served as a potent social commentary. The very society that drove Travis to madness, is also the society that treats him as a hero after he murders the pimps; would the public's reaction have been the same if he actually killed the political figure? It is interesting how urban life can twist a man and then twist his actions into something advantageous. Like Travis, it would seem we are more interested in end results rather than our motivations or our means of achieving those results. 'Taxi Driver' is a complex film that is sure to take various viewings to decipher its multiple messages; however, I think once the viewer has completed the journey down insanity lane, he or she will be more than pleased. For the beautiful yet grungy cinematography, terrific acting, amazing story, and for the infamous 'Are you talking' to me?' scene, I give 'Taxi Driver': 5 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic",10,0,0,14 January 2006
Garden State," Garden State (3/5 stars)
","I don't think there are any real spoilers in here but I don't want the folks at IMDb to become angry with me so that is why you see the warning. But like I usually say: if you are really picky then move on.Synopsis: 'Garden State' at its heart, is a quirky love story. Braff's character must return to his childhood home after learning of his mother's death. This of course is a problem because it is his past that haunts him. However, Braff's character goes home nonetheless. There, he meets a very bizarre but lovable character played by Portman. They soon fall in love. Through the course of this movie Braff's character encounters many of his inner-demons and begins to deal with him. For example, Braff's character tell his father how he really feels for the first time (you know, the typical father/son cliché). Soon enough, Braff's character decides to head back home to LA, but if he does this then he will leave Portman's character behind and their love life will diminish. What does he do?! He stays of course, which makes a cute but typical ending. The acting was absolutely superb; Braff plays a complacent individual like it was second nature, and Portman breezes through a very weird role, and not only this, but she makes us love her character in the process. Braff also directed and wrote this nice little story, and I look forward to seeing more of his work. Some of the only problems with this movie was its clichés and lack of excitement at certain points. Overall I give 'Garden State': 3 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic",7,1,5,21 March 2005
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction (5/5 stars)
","Synopsis: I really can't tell you much about this film because I do not want to ruin the experience. This is one of those movies that is best left a secret, but what I can tell you is that it's legendary, remarkable, and re-watchable. Each scene is simply classic and the dialog is thick but so incredibly clever that one hungers for it. The acting is absolutely fabulous. John and Uma have such chemistry during the 'dance scene'--it was engaging and enthralling. Samuel L. Jackson delivers his infamous 'speech' with such fervor and vengeance that the words are as bullets. I also remember laughing heavily at the dark humor and simple bizzareness of this gem. 'Pulp Fiction' is a quirky gangster film on its surface but when one digs a little deeper it is a story about redemption. Notice the difference between the fates of John and Samuel's characters, and also notice how Bruce redeems himself. This would all be well and good enough as it is, but Quentin is not done yet. Not only does he bring forth an arsenal of brilliant directing (his classic 'car trunk' shot), but he also makes a circular film (the beginning and the end are the same). This movie is great, just simply fantastic. And another lovely bonus is that 'Pulp Fiction' never gets old, which is something hard to come by nowadays. 'Pulp Fiction' is probably the best movie of the 90's and is certainly one of the best films of all time, and I mean that. The only people who will not like 'Pulp Fiction' are dumbasses (who will get confused by the story format), the squeamish (who don't like gruesome screen violence), and right-wingers (who think that sex,violence, and profanity are the earmarks of a bad movie). All and all I give 'Pulp Fiction': 5 out of 5 stars.NOTE: 1/5 stars = bad 2/5 stars = OK 3/5 stars = good 4/5 stars = great 5/5 stars = classic 2005 Imaginist",10,1,3,21 March 2005
Psycho," Psycho (5/5 stars)
","Synopsis: Every so often a movie will shatter an audience's preconceived notions and expectations; 'Psycho' is that kind of film. The key to 'Psycho' is that it came out nearly 50 years ago and while viewing the film one should keep this in mind. Most of the surprises and tricks we take for granted today were at one point something totally new and different. Writers so often steal and copy ideas from others that everything becomes predictable--in fact, that is the major problem with today's horror flick: the viewer knows exactly what is going to happen. However, 'Psycho' is sort of a first cause, it's a film that stole nothing yet inspired everything. Of course, to watch the 'Psycho' in this day and age isn't nearly as exciting as it would have been back in 1960. But as I stated, in order to truly appreciate Hitchcock's genius one has to put himself back in a theatre during 'Psycho's' release.The film begins with a young woman, Marion Crane (Leigh). She seems like a respectable girl, but she soon falls to temptation and steals forty thousand dollars from her employer. After this she immediately leaves town and heads towards California. Before she reaches her destination she must first take a night's rest at a roadside motel, the Bates Motel, and here begins our descent into the darkness. At the dilapidated motel, Marion meets the owner, Norman Bates (played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins), and they even have a nice dinner together. Hitchcock has set up the perfect thriller; he dupes us into believing this film is now going to somehow center on Marion and Norman, and in a way it does, but not in the way we anticipate. Hitch starts this film as a classic 'cat and mouse' game: girl steal money, cops try to get money back. But all of our expectations are shattered as Marion is brutally stabbed to death while she is taking a shower in her motel room. We even discover that the perpetrator is Norman's crazy mother.Marion may be dead, but her crime is well enough alive. A private investigator (Martin Balsam) (hired by Marion's sister and boyfriend)is on her tail, and traces her to the Bates motel. He too meets and untimely death, and once again we are astounded. Hitchcock not only killed his main character, but now he has killed a cop. We are held in complete suspense; we know that Hitch is not afraid to kill anyone, and that means anything can happen. This is the kind of remarkable and groundbreaking stuff I was talking about. No other director before Hitchcock was as brazen as to knock off the female lead (and certainly not while she was naked in the shower). Could you imagine seeing this for the first time?Soon enough Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and boyfriend (John Gavin) decide to go find her themselves. They want to convince Marion to turn herself in so she may receive a lesser penalty for her crime. Right before the private investigator was murdered by Momma Bates, he told them that he had traced Marion to the Bates Motel, and thus the two of them head off to the hellhole. Shortly after this point the film ends, and what an end it is! Hitchcock has set us up for one of the most suspenseful, disturbing, and surprising conclusions in cinematic history. I can only imagine how incredible this experience would have been back in 1960, but alas, 'Psycho's' ending is hardly a secret anymore and some of its more shocking moments are not nearly as jaw-dropping in this modern age. However, that doesn't change the fact that 'Psycho' spawned the modern horror genre and gave us some of Hitchcock's best cinematography.We have been exposed to almost fifty years of copycats since 'Psycho' and because of this I think we have forgotten just how amazing the original was. It is like living in Arizona: one sees the sun so often he forgets how glorious it was when he first moved there. So yes, 'Pyscho' may seem a bit dated, but that isn't the films fault; that is our fault--we have seen to many duplicates. I will also admit that 'Pyscho' doesn't really have much of a message (well, unless one counts the film's brief mention of how people create 'traps' for themselves). However, this movie's goal is not to preach, but to scare and surprise, and I believe it succeeds wonderfully in this area (so long as we can imagine ourselves in a 1960's theatre). 'Pyscho' is not only a part of American culture, but a milestone in American film-making, and probably Hitchcock's greatest achievement. For all these reasons and them some, I give 'Psycho': 5 out of 5 stars.",10,0,0,21 January 2006
