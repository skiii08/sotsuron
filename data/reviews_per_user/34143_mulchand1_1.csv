Marie Antoinette," Eye candy yes, but perhaps deeper meaning?
","The sets and costumes are outrageously sensual, on the vibrancy of the color alone the movie is worth watching. Probably a bit too clever in its attempts at camera angles, art direction, but certainly vivid and compelling to look at.Although the film does not dwell on it, the point of the rising debt of the country is made occasionally. Could the film not also be looked at as an allegory of contemporary America? Blissfully ignorant of reality in the form of bills that need to be paid? Foreign wars causing huge deficits, yet spending on whatever frivolities demanded, and neglecting the consequences? I am not sure Sofia Coppola's intent was this, but I sure see some correlation here, between Marie and the court and the majority of Americans who cannot find Iraq on a map, yet are urged even yet today by our leaders to continue shopping.",6,0,0,18 March 2007
