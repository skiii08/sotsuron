Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You will not be disappointed.
","Whenever a movie is this heavily anticipated, we wonder if it can live up to the expectations. Well, this one does.It's a 'Star Wars' movie. All the same elements are there. The same magic, excitement, and sheer child-like wonder. This film, like the others, is ultimately optimistic and happy. Good will triumph over evil. That must be a comforting thought, and 'Star Wars' films make it seem like a certainty. (I saw it at a critics' advance screening one week before the official opening).",Null,0,2,12 May 1999
Life Is Beautiful," ...and so is this movie
","'Life is Beautiful' is a fantastic film. Full of humor and sweetness, it is an uplifting story of love and devotion. Leaving the theater, all I could think was that life, just like this movie, truly is beautiful. An emotional, powerfully made film.",10,1,2,17 February 1999
