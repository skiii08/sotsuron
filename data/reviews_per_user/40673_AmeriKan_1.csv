The Blair Witch Project," 3 college students get lost in the woods while making a documentary on a local legend, the 'Blair Witch'.
","Let me get this out first and foremost... TBWP had its flaws, but so far, its the best movie I've seen this year.  I know a lot of people have said this film 'sucks' or 'its not scary at all' or whatever but don't believe them for a second.  This is one of the most frightening films ever created. People who don't think this is scary either don't have an imagination or have been brainwashed by Kevin Williamson's idea of what is scary. This is it, folks... THE horror film of the 90's.",10,1,2,5 September 1999
