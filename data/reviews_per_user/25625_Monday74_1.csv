Ford v Ferrari," All's forgiven Steve McQueen !
","****** Warning mild spoilers ******.
I have always been critical of the 1971 Le Mans movie mainly due to the seemingly tacked on love story presumably put in on the behest of the studio to make it a movie rather than a documentary of the 1970 Le Mans race.However now that I have seen the latest Le Mans movie I have a nostalgic yearning for a movie with a pointless incomprehensible love story sparingly threaded in between fantastic racing footage and non CGI stunt work.Which is the complete opposite to what you get in Le Mans 66 which has instead threaded rather sparsely CGI heavy Le Mans racing footage in to a Bale/Damon star vehicleAt nearly 3 hours long it feels like watching a less than classic year at the 24 hours of Le Mans in its entirety, the story of how Henry Ford 2nd anger at Enzo Ferrari's apparent deception in Fords attempt to buy Ferrari is over simplified and rushed which would leave a viewer who had little or no knowledge of the true story behind the film baffled as to why Henry Ford was enraged enough to throw so much money at the GT40 project.Anyway eventually about just over half the movie run time we get to Le Mans in 1966 and we start to get what we paid for 'classic cars racing in a classic race' albeit CGI'd to the max.My advice wait for the movie to get on the streaming sites so you can fast forward through the porridge.",6,2,7,26 November 2019
