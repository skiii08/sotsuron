The Blair Witch Project," A Masterpiece of the true meaning of FEAR
","This film is one of (if not the) most accurate depictions of true fear ever to make it from the mind to the screen.  We all know what it feels like, but nobody can describe it accurately enough to make the listener FEEL it as we have.  This film does. The comments I have read on here amaze me.  This film is NOT about the 'witch', it is about being lost in the woods and the increasing paranoia and fear that result.  It's a slow building process.  By the second day in the woods, the 'witch' is forgotten and the filmmakers focus on their own dread and fear.  THAT is what this film is about.  Not a 'witch' that so many are disappointed that they didn't see.  Little do those folks know, they saw the true monster of the film, but are not perceptive enough to realize it.  And to those who say they could have made this film themselves:  why didn't you, stupid?",10,1,2,7 August 1999
