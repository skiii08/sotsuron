The Devil's Advocate," Vanities of the bonfires: a riveting film
","Vanity fuels the clash between good and evil. The film is so superbly photographed, remarkably played and directed that you are easily sucked into the flammable issues and charged scenes, potential 'bush fires', with your emotions taking control. Only after the film may you have the time to reflect. The young lawyer from Florida, Keenu Reeves, who is winning all his cases vainly thinks that he is in control of himself. His acceptance of a fabulously well paid legal job in New York where the world is so much brighter, richer, intriguing, challenging only fuels his vain belief in his legal superiority. The legal firm's boss, Al Pacino, mysteriously encourages Reeves to fly higher, to feel that he can be even stronger and go on winning. Lawyer Reeves beliefs, formed from his religious upbringing by his religious mother, are insidiously tested by Al Pacino. Is winning the only star to follow, what about losing? If God is for love and compassion, is the Devil's role, as advocated by Al Pacino, to inject vanity into intuition to power the business world to winning ever better results no matter whether the world thinks otherwise? A real dilemma for Americans, as its must-win role is corroding the international political world. The good Reeves is threatened by the need to make difficult choices. His falling for the temptations of mastering the situations opens the door to evil paths. His wife, victimized by devilish hallucinations and her doubts that love and compassion are strong enough to withstand the temptations showered on her husband by Al Pacino, increases the pressure on him. The hyper modern business interiors, the stunning shots of New York, the very beautiful women as diabolic temptations inject more fuel into the rising tensions. Serious questions begin to crackle and smolder. The powerful acting controls the potential fission. Reeves is drawn in to the bonfire, vainly believing that he can handle the conflicts and unexplained deaths that pummel him. But Al Pacino's role succumbs also to vanity! Al Pacino cannot either avoid the bonfire of evil ambitions. Brilliant last scenes justifiably disturb the mind. Masterfully convincing acting by Reeves, Charlize Theron his wife and Al Pacino with the beautiful photography make this film a must to see.",9,1,1,2 November 2005
Cold Mountain," Civil War of blood, pain, love fails to reach the heights
","After 630 or so comments what remains to be said? A European view maybe? The film fails. Why? Historically, its so American. 1860 of the civil war was fought primarily between the European immigrants who fled Europe because of the continual wars, social conflicts, poverty that their generations had experienced. The film lacks this perspective. The films from the great directors on war, U.S. and European, avoid the exaggerated dense combat in such a compressed colour spectrum as that of the Cold Mountain, found however in European paintings but nowhere better than in Leonardo da Vinci's Battle of Anghiari. Paintings are not films. Cold Mountain lacks distance, space and battle rhythm that is so well done in Sam Peckinpath's masterpiece Cross of Iron in the other great war films. The love story fails to reach the heights of intense emotion as other U.S. and European war films have done. The acting is good, but no better than many other films of relatively good quality. Strong coherence of a powerful current throughout the film is lacking. Through American eyes the film has nostalgic merit but as an independent work of art in the western world it lacks emotional conviction, and so sadly fails.",5,2,6,10 March 2008
The Patriot," Violence debauches the War of Independence
","A well made action film to please all those who like Mel Gibson's style and his full throttle action. The film fits in to his search for ultimate violence, from the Mad Max trilogy, through the Lethal Weapon series, then The Patriot and finally the ultimate excess in The Passion of Christ where violence thrusts shatteringly deep in to the heart and soul of the viewer, adding little except possibly rekindling the curiosity to know more about Christianity in the Bible. The Patriot fails miserably as a historical film as it warps and lies about people and events in the American War of Independence. For instance: Why lie about the English general Cornwallis as a person who condoned atrocities? Why insert a bestiality which did not occur in the war but in Europe from Nazi actions in the Second World War (burning inhabitants of whole villages in churches, to name just one example from France Odour-sur-Glane, 642 inhabitants, men, women and children burnt in the church and shot in barns by SS Das Reich, 10 June 1944)? Vote 4 out of 5 for the action and pace, 1 for the somewhat distorted role of the Militias and 0 for the history which should have been the most absorbing part.",5,2,5,12 December 2005
Quantum of Solace," QoS suffers from Marketing Directors!
","This comment is more about the conflict between the intellectuals and the marketing people of the film. So the comments are more directed toward the management of the new James Bond series starting with Casino Royal. Casino Royal was clearly a success, 9/10, primarily because of the intellectual input. The follow-up Quantum of Solace clearly suffered from the marketing influence. Public opinion with a preference for action that dominates has determined the film QoS. Mass public for action 70-80%, compared to 20% intellectual of public opinion surveys. (Proportions, uncertain, are known clearly by the marketing people.) However the reputation of James Bond is primarily determined by the intellectuals. IMDb full synopsis is essential reading. The action in the film is too fast, too fragmented between places and people, dialogue too truncated. So, in my opinion, the management of the film have done themselves a disservice in going almost all out for action and relegating the intellectual story line and dialogue to a minor role. Hopefully, Casino Royal made more money than Quantam of Solace has done so far. If so the the action wildies have also appreciated the intellectual strong story line of Casino Royal. Food for thought for the James Bond management. The literature of James Bond series is, in my opinion, down the path of the intellectuals, which just confirms the original intention of the author! (You have my permission to send this comment to the management of the James Bond series.) Yours sincerely, KSundstrom (Nice,France)",7,0,5,25 July 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," Meltown on Soviet sub threatens world...
","High tension acting played brilliantly by Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. Claustrophobic photography and uplifting music bolster the tension and the moral conflicts of the film. It is clear now that the risk of a nuclear catastrophe in the K-19 sub was real in 1961 with a probable trigger-quick nuclear retaliation by America. Unbelievable? Why then did the President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev propose in 2005 to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee that the crew of the K-19 should be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for their actions of July 4, 1961? Harrison Ford, who is half Irish and half Russian, and Liam Neeson, who is Irish, (both having much somewhat similar hardships and adventure in their youth) rose convincingly to the acting challenges of different personalities having to come to terms with higher moral ideals. They gave surprisingly inspiring performances of a higher order than the classical moral acting of Hollywood movies of the 1930's-1950's. In the Hollywood movies opposition on moral grounds to government, politicians and military authorities could lead to loss of career. In the Soviet such opposition meant either death or banishment to the frightful prisons of Siberia, etc., the Gulag. Ford, as Commandant Nikolai Vadimirovich Zateyev, is ordered to take over the command of the first submarine converted to nuclear capability from Neeson, the Commander Mihail Polenin, who stays as second in command. Ford is the person the Communist Politburo and Military consider politically reliable whereas Neeson is too undisciplined and chummy with the crew. The Soviet Union wants now to demonstrate to America that it is also a superpower with intercontinental nuclear missiles. The Amerian Navy has an observer ship near by. More importantly at stake is the Soviet's reputation in the eyes of the Third World. Its mission must not fail! Meltdown of the nuclear reactor powering the K-19 is caused by a faulty cooling circuit. (Remember the scary repercussions of Third Mile Island?). Ford knows that the intense heat from this risks a catastrophic explosion of the nuclear missiles which would also blow out of the water the American observer ship. This would could risk an automatic nuclear riposte from America against the Soviet Union. The 1960's were the years of sabre rattling and trigger happy generals. Ford cannot ask the Americans for help - a sign of Soviet weakness in the eyes of all. Neeson wants to. Thus the conflict. But as crew members voluntarily offer their lives to enter the radiated chamber to welder the leaks, the character changes between Ford and Neeson. They rise finally to a very high order - a higher moral dimension which also involves the crew. A dimension so missing from many of Hollywoods films. This lack of moral fiber in Hollywood - reflected in the recent disappointments regarding prisons in Iraq - is probably also the reason for the erroneous marketing of the film. Hopefully, Hollywood will re-find this moral fiber. Hopefully it will re-market the K-19 as a film worthy of reflection, with great action and human understanding.",9,1,1,12 March 2006
Mulholland Drive," A psycho thriller for junkies
","Why say 'for junkies'? Simon Rattle the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestre expressed the sentiment that the 'kicks' from music was like a drug, saying also he would thus willingly be a 'junky' for the rest of his life. David Lynch has not reached that level of wisdom. His Mulholland Drive has no recognizable threads in the first 45 minutes that convince one of a major theme to come. Just irritation that a kaleidoscope of fragmented images should hold one's full attention. No initial story line that almost all good modern literature has. The story between the three women Betty and Rita and the unknown who takes refuge in the house of Betty (details of the story given by other commentators) starts after about an hour. One wonders if the film had been just as interesting to get the directors prize at Cannes in 2002 without the first 40 minutes - just 5 minutes would have been enough to set the scene. 2/10 for the first 45 minutes, the impact of the good photography radically reduced by the incomprehensible fragments of the first 45 minutes. 'Imcomrehensible' is a judgment formed from great modern literature. So begin after the first psychedelic 45 minutes, enjoy the rest. That will avoid the irritation of pseudo art in the beginning.",5,0,2,7 February 2009
Taken," Taken: many themes to think more about
","The admirable plot synopsis provided needs no further description of the plot and the action. Liam Neeson surely must have been attracted by the very serious themes in the script, primarily written by Luc Besson. In the modern genre of very fast action, rough, tough and clinically effective a la Besson, the moral and political themes remind one however of the great era of Hollywoods major films which contained, under the surface of a passionate story, very strong moral and political themes that influenced generations not only in the west but also in the middle and far east. To-day, some of these major themes in the film which concern us deeply but need more attention in seeing the film Taken but need to be repeated in future films are: - - parentalguidance, responsibility and protection of our children (TV is full of failures of parents to accept fully what all this means) - young peoples gullibility in search of exciting experiences which can have grave consequences for parents and friends - the growing threat of immigration with criminal intent. As the film is made in Europe, it is the increasing influx of mafia like organisations from East Europe - the ever prevailant corruption in political circles - the ever prevailant demand for vengeance preferred to due process of law, despite the great increase in the proportion of the population with higher education The film is worth seeing several times to absorb all these issues. Liam Neeson is to be honored for promoting them.",8,0,0,12 January 2011
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Elizabeth 1: The Golden Age needs a third film
","Elizabeth 1: The Golden Age gets only an average: 5. But the acting gets 8 (9 for Cate Blanchett), the rest only 3. Why only 3? The director Shekar Kapur in his second part of Elizabeth 1 (first part 1998) provides marvelous parts such as Elizabeth's court when receiving the ambassadors and Sir Walter Raleigh, the hectic preparation for defending England against the Spanish Armada 1588 and the dramatic naval battle. But the rest is very much Bollywood stuff, though Shekar Kapur is not an Indian but from Pakistan. Great improvements to England were made under Elizabeth's rule. The incorporation of the East India Company which ruled India until 1857 before the rule was taken over by the English Crown. The modest beginning of stock exchange trading (influence of the Dutch), development of industry (textile, mines and naval construction), better agriculture, the acceptance of the growing role of the middle classes, better conditions for the poor... Secondly, the role of Sir Walter Raleigh does not do justice to his importance. No emphasis on his contributions as scholar, soldier, sailor and statesman, just emphasis in the film on his piracy, colonization of Virginia and his sex appeal. The thoughtful viewer is ignored, just historical froth is served up. Shekar Kapur can do better. Let's hope he can be given the opportunity to rise to the challenge in a third definitive version of Elizabeth 1.",5,1,2,31 December 2010
Live Free or Die Hard," Die Hard Action Extreme
","For action unrelenting a vote of 8/10. But for a film for those who like a story of human breadth, like me, then only 4/10. Die Hard 4 repeats the warning, repeated during the last 15 years or so of the vulnerability of a society dependent too much on computer information systems. Thus, if any societal computer system crashes to politicians surprise one will have to conclude that they never learnt from all the Hollywood films warning them of the risques. Die Hard 4 slams the vulnerability issue really hard into those responsible for national security. The film makes a quick direct reference to FEMA/US Administration and its failure to handle the New Orleans Katrina disaster! Another issue in the film is the Big Brother surveillance of private people that is increasing rapidly in the US. So Die Hard 4 offers nothing substantially new. It reemphasizes the problems with more exasperation and fear. No need to think anew, just sit back and admire the pyro-technics of Hollywood's creativity. Computer games and internet amusements appear to be the food for thought for an increasing share of the population. Maybe this increasing public don't care much for political issues nor have time to understand world events - though this public likes to comment in blogs, etc. Unfortunately American security efforts abroad, repeat abroad, seem way behind what one should expect from the professionalism of Hollywood on security actions films. Die Hard 4 is also a warning to the US Government: reliance on super technology fails against mans ingenuity on the ground. Witness Afghan fighters in 2008 proving a match for American super military technology - like Bruce Willis surviving the onslaught of the latest super US Air Force fighter attack! Therefore, Die Hard 4 has an important political message. Bruce Willis and company all act exceptionally well. The computer boys are faultless. No other country can compete in this genre.",6,0,1,6 January 2009
