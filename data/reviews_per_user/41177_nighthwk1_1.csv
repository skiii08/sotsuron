Marie Antoinette," One of the most shallow movies I've ever seen
","I saw this movie last night and was severely disappointed. While the scenery and costumes were done well, there was very little character development or plot.Characters spoke in modern American English with a limited vocabulary (not even a fake French accent), the music was distracting and felt very out of place in nearly every scene, and because of the lack of character, I didn't care what happened to anyone. And it feels like it's about four hours long.Sofia earned some respect from me with Lost in Translation, but seeing this movie makes me think that it was all because of the actors, not her direction.",1,50,98,23 October 2006
