Minority Report," Spielberg and Tom Cruise best movie
","I'm not really a fan of Spielberg or Tom Cruise but is the first time that I'm totally sure that they deserved a 10 for the movie. This is not a typical Spielberg movie who in the past years decided to work with dinousaurs and the hollocast (I haven't seen yet AI). This movie from the same mind of totally recall and blade runner is the best picture I've seen in years. The plot is interesting, and the script is excellent, but the main attraction is the work of the director of Photography Janus Kaminsky, who recreate a very futuristic but realistic world, with lot of numbers and a grey and blue tone. The cast work well. This is a role from Tom Cruise who give his best performance. Cruise isn't a great actor, but in the few past year he grew a lot as an actor (compare his peromance in MI1 and MI2, and makes his performance credible and John Anderson the drogadictic police chief, who is involve in a future crime. However his co-star Colin Farrell, isn't good enough as the Javert of the 21 century Danny Witwear.  He start well but later he collaps. Much more better are Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton. Both gave the best performance of the movie. Von Sydow is one of the best actors of all the time, and he did not dissapointed here. He makes his ambiguos chararcter natural and credible, and finally Mrs Morton, is a beautiful lady that look horrible as the tiny co gorb Agatha (except the last scene), but gave a great performance, specially at the end where she steal the show as the mysterious woman that had the minority report. She will be the next Redgrave and Glenda Jackson (the three in one). The rest of the cast, from the police, to the doctors and scientific and unkown actress that portrays Cruise wife are excellent. Finally congratulation to Mr Spielberg that gave us an imaginative story with lot of suspense and confirm him as the best North American director alive. Steaven reafirms here as a storyteller. IT was a pity that M Report wasn't the biggest blockbuster summer movie of 2002, because is a masterpiece.",10,0,0,27 July 2002
Star Trek," All about my mother
","I'm not a startrek fan. In fact I've never seen the 60's series or their motion pictures. I've seen only a couple of chapters of the animated series and Generetions. So I'm not concern or interested in the Trekkie Phenomenon.These movie was great, because behind the action and visual effects scenes, it's a movie about family values. All the plot involves family matters, parents that tries to save their children, and sons that tries to save their parents. Also the responsibility of the Captain the father of the starship, and the nexus of the crew with their Captain. Even the main Villain Nero (Eric Bana), porpouses is to revange his own family. There is also two short but memorable, mother and son relationship. A theme that American Cinema most of the time forget. The lovely relationship of lost between mother (an always Shiny Winona Ryder despite the horrible makeover) and son (Zachary Quinto). Also the movie has lot of fan, thanks to the comedies abbilities from part of the cast. Anton Yelchin, who was the funny teen of Indie movie, is histerically funny with his accent, or Simmon Pegg who is a comedian of the mayor ligues. and Chris Pine as Kirk is the main revelation. Pine has a couple of too light movies in his curriculum, so this movie, will make him an star. It's funny,wild and has the right amount of film precense to be the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. The other big surprise of the movie is Karl Urban, who is brilliant as the frighten to fly, doctor divorced, and acts as Kirk Pal and old bro. The only underused character is Zulu, but he has his scene and probably in the next sequel his participation should be better. Zoe Saldana as Uhura is great, is beauty and sexy, the only bad thing is that her participation start to decline in the movies second half.To sum up, Startrek is a a great movie for all the family for the lovely values -among the action, comedy and v.e- that the world needs.",9,1,10,14 June 2009
Corpse Bride," Emily Watson Rocks!!!
","This is Tim Burton best movie since Edward Scisorhands. He capture a genuine true love story, and a perfect movie for a date. The animation is perfect (at least 300 % better than Jack). Of course have all the burtonian elements a creepy and romantic story, some black humor, parts for children and other for adults etc, and the fascination of an underworld, which is much happier than the live one. And Johnny Depp and Chritopher Lee are excellent in their roles. However someone still the picture and thats is Victoria, Victor's fiancé, a character made by the sensitive and gestually Emily Watson. Really Burton and his group have maken a wonderful job translating the talent of this great actress to the animated screen.",9,0,1,22 October 2005
The Last Legion," Stupid movie
","Bad very bad movie, made for kinder garden kids. the only interesting point, is that one of the few 'Roman' movies that are about the decline of the Imperioum. The last scene, is one of the most stupid ends I ever seen.This is not Gladiator, not Excalibur, looks more like an stupid miniseries from FX. Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley desperated needs the money for doing that piece of crap. and the name of Weinstain and Di Laurentis show that these guys just smoke something to make this and expend 65 m.Only for the Indian Star fans.",2,6,18,23 July 2007
Wanted," Finally a good vehicle for Angelina Jolie
","There was an Angie before and after girl interrupted/bone collector. Before was a great actress for miniseries but very bad for movies. After GI/TBC was the great femele choice for action flicks. The main trouble was almost all sucks, and none was a masterpiece (well the b.c and G. I weren't either). And her dramas and comedies were bad and her performance even worse. Even I dislike her in the too hate or too love performance of a Mighty hard. Finally I thought that Jolie was one of the most overrated actresses and one of the worst. But finally I've seen a good vehicle for her, not only but also a GOOD MOVIE TOO!!! She acts like a reptile and looks wonderful and strong. Her co-star are equally good, James McAvoy is the perfect nerd turn hero, and Morgan Freeman and Thomas Krestchmann as ambiguous assesins are great too. In fact a very good movie, with some social contious material that fix well, lot of humour and a fantastic finish.",8,4,10,20 September 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gollum deserves an Oscar
","The Two towers is the shorter book of the trilogy. However it started in the fourth page and finish at the middle of the book. Three hour for 150 pages it's too long. Also the second book is a too free version of Tolkien novel, especially if it's compare with the first one. The second also have the same trouble than the first one (the older characters like Arwen, Legolas or Frodo are portray by very young actors while the younger like Eowyn or Pippin are very old: that remain the golden period of Hollywood like Little Women 1949 or Romeo and Julliet 1936).  Also some important figures of the Novel like the very Cool Pippin or Farimir are reduce too mere figures decorative. The other big mistake is too killing an Elf. In the trilogy none of the elf dies- However this movie is much personal and have a nice love triangle between 70 Aragorn, 2500 Arwen and 22 Eowyn. Aragorn and Arwen love scenes are really beautiful and passionate. The Helm Abysm fight scene is one of the most gorgeous battles of cinema history. And the visual effects are much better than the first one. Even when is easy too distinguish a natural scene than aThis movie had four things that I like very much: the love triangle, the Helm Abysm and too digital characters: The treebeard Ent (voice by Rhys Davies) and specially Gollum. Gollum Smeagol choice of being a good or bad hobbit is the best performance I'have seen in a long time. Sometimes evil some times sweet, Peter Weir and actor Andy Serkis creates a very seducer creature, who robbed the heart and the applause from the audience. To conclude is maybe too long but fortunately is also very different from the first one, so in possible than the Return of the King will be the best of all.",Null,0,0,31 January 2003
Moulin Rouge!," the controversial cabaret
","Mouline Rouge I think that was only a vehicle to Mrs. Cruise to receive her first Oscar. However I've decide to see the movie, after the controversy of the film, where half of the critics loves it and the other half hate. My impressions were good. Of course is not A+, and the plot and script is too conventional, as most of the musical are. But the passion that made the director and cast remains to the eyes and ears of the audience. Buzz, recreates in his weak and MTV style a wonderful, opulent and decadent Paris.  Nicole Kidman maybe she did not look as French cabaret girl, but she is beautiful and talent and give a lot of intensity to the role of Satine, but she is not the only sparkle gem, her love interest Ewan Mcgregor is excellent, in fact that guy can play every type of role (from the addict of Trainspotting to a dumb hunk in LV, with this movie we forgive his Obi Wan Kanobi in Ep1 (in AOTC was much better)John Leguisamo as Toulouse Lautrec was also good, however Jim Broabandt is the best of the cast. I think that some people hate the musical, because they don't like the pop of the 80's where the movie is inspired (a cameo of 80's superstar Kylie Minogue is include. I `ve got a little tired of Elton john Songs and specially the repetition of 'all you need is love'. But there are three exception. The very funny can can song that where guys try to convence the duke, the dark tango 'Roxanne', and Kiman feelings in 'like a virgin'. In fact it's a movie that is save by the pasion of the director, cast and crew.",Null,0,1,24 September 2002
The Illusionist," This movie should be great...
","...if hasn't so unsatisfied end. The story was great, Edward Norton share another excellent performance, he shared lot of peace. Rufus Sewell also give a fine performance, and Jessica Biel was a revelation, she portray very well an Austrich Dutchess (remember me Ingrid Bergman or Julie Christie), in facts we forget that she is a party girl. The main trouble is Paul Giamatty laugh at the end, I can't forget that conspiracies against the Austrich Monarchy and Franz Joseph Conservative politics, ended in WW1, with very ugly consequences to Austria and Hungary. I think that Prince Rodulph deserved pity from Uhl, and not laugh.",6,2,2,27 January 2007
Lincoln," Licoln great political movie
","I cannot understand why the Academy and other Awards prefer Ben Affleck's Argo than Spielberg Lincoln. It's probably the best Spielberg since Schindler's list and Jurassik PArk.- Lincoln is for Spielberg filmography almost what is Age of Inocense for Martin Scorcese. Excellent script by Tony Kushner, production design by Jon Erickson Rick Carter and Costume Design by Joanna Johnston. Lincoln also has an Iconic performance of the great Daniel Day Lewis. The supporting cast is almost equally good. Oscar nominates Sally Field (maybe too many screen minutes of Mary Todd and her family) and Tommy Lee Jones are brilliant, but Lee Pace and David Strathairn are equally good or even better. Original score and cinematography, well excellent but I wanted new names besides Williams and Kaminzki. I get a little bored of them. And best of all the SUBJECT. In a world that divided democracies between countries with a president with absolute power in the Congress (almost a dictatorship or an Absolute Government) and others that anullates each other. It's a pleasure to see a film, that is about consensus, and explain how to obtain the votes, without loosing the integrity. From Obama to Ahmadineyad, from Merkel to Cretina Kichner, all should learn about this great president that was Lincoln, instead of complain the opposition, god or the world for their failures. The same goes for every opposition from the republicans to the Syrian ones.-",9,1,3,5 April 2013
12 Years a Slave," Slavery is bad
","Long time ago, in the romantic and wonderful south of Scarlett O'Hara, where black people were slaves, woman remain virgins until marriage, children obey their parents, there were no l Jews were in America, and the only gay human being was Orson Welles, who was living in an ugly and dirty place called London. A free black man called Solomon Northup was confused with a slave. So he served as a slave for 12 years, for different jerks who thoughts they were preachers. And blame their black people for all the bad things. We all know that God is catholic and the rest is just people that thoughts that they are Christian, when in real life we know that are just pagans who adored the devil. The worst by far is Edwin Epps who had an ugly wife and is attracted to an even uglier young black slave, Patsy, who deservedly is punished for have his master so bad taste in women. Not all black people were bad threaded . For example there is Dominique Deveroux mother who teach ed her daughter that there is no more bitch girl, than a black bitch.- Finally Northup received the help of Matt Fincher superhero Brad Pitt who rescued him from Slavary. The he changed his name to Chiwitel Ejiofor, and become and actor and gain an Oscar nomination, just to loose his deserved Oscar to the bastard idiotic son of Edwin Epps Matthew McConaughey. That jerk thanked his father in the speech and then gives one of Epps typical sermons- For the rest of characters Patsy was rescued by Angelina Jolie. Today is one of her 250 adopted daughters. The Epps divorced, and now Mrs Epps makes threesomes with Ellen Degeneres and Rosie O'Donell, while Edwin lost everything, and past his last days of future past as the slave of the terrible slavery Jennifer Lawrence. Brad Pitt had an even worse faith, he dated a couple of years Gwynneth Paltrow.- Well that's the story and my review of 12 years of Slave. Slavery is bad, but dating Gwyneth is even a worse experience.-",6,0,3,3 July 2014
Ice Age: Continental Drift," I missed Scratty
","and definitive is the worst of the ICE Age Franchise. Scratty is less than ten secconds. Eddy and Crash and Eddie also have very few minutes The plot involve the annoying teenage mamut of Manny (Nicky Menage), and the evil pirates of ice age (Peter Dinklage as a gigant Jennifer Lopez a bad imitation of Jolie's Kung fu panda). Annoying too. The best new character is Sid's Grandma (Wanda Sykes) who has by far the best lines.- From the main 3 trio only Sid had funny lines, specially the one with the Crab.- Scrat segments are as always the highlights, however not as well as the others IA.The 3D is good but not spectacular-",3,7,13,7 July 2012
