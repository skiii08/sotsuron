The Blair Witch Project," Neat idea- boring results
","What should be said about Blair Witch? I am a horror movie connoisseur and I must say that the concept was a great idea; the beginning of the film intriguing- However, throughout the whole movie I was on the edge of my seat WAITING for something scary and exciting to happen!  The cast members did their part to a certain extent, but the movie overall lacked Thrill and Chills-the needless running and screaming was quite a drain on the nerves as well. Although original in film thought....Tasteless in texture and substance!  A good horror film would have you covering your eyes with your hands-not looking at your watch. I think the director meant well with originality, but the film is highly overrated! If you haven't paid to see it yet but are dying to-ha ha, save some time and money...at LEAST wait for it on video.",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
