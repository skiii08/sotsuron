Catch Me If You Can," Top-notch, brilliantly crafted entertainment, rich with fascinating details, memorable incidents and engaging performances
","What a terrific piece of film-making! From the charming animated title sequence (featuring John Williams's delightfully sneaky score) to the end, this is an enormously entertaining film from the gifted craftsman, Steven Spielberg, who is so damn good people take him for granted or resent his 'manipulation,' i.e. his seemingly effortless ability to create effective drama.Leonardo DiCaprio (in his best performance that I've seen) stars as Frank Abagnale, Jr., a real-life teen-aged con man so spectacularly gifted that he was able to steal millions from various companies with forged checks, while successfully impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a lawyer, among other guises. He is chased by a rigidly rule-bound F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is at first comically out-classed by the young improvising criminal genius; but the agent is steadfast and relentless and has the law on his side. The movie is filled with delightful supporting performances, starting with Hanks and continuing on with Nathalie Baye as the boy's selfish mother, Amy Adams as his immature fiancée and on down to the tiniest role. I'm especially grateful for the sympathetic part given to Christopher Walken, as the mischievous and spirited Abagnale Sr., whose life darkens as his fortunes fall. Walken is one of my favorite actors, but while I enjoy the occasional one-dimensional freak or villain he plays, I wish most of his parts were like this.Spielberg's movie is rich with fascinating details and memorable incidents, while the script by Jeff Nathanson moves backward and forward in time to tell the story in the most engrossing way possible. This is top-notch entertainment.",Null,66,73,5 June 2010
Chinatown," A good private eye film, even if too long and overpraised
","Despite its reputation, 'Chinatown' lacks the wit, speed and economy of the best movies in the private eye genre: this is no 'Maltese Falcon' or 'The Big Sleep.' It's not bad: Robert Towne gives us a cleverly convoluted script with some sharp lines; the color photography is seamy and compelling; the bluesy Jerry Goldsmith score is hypnotic; and Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway are the perfect 1970s choices for a 1930s private detective and femme fatale. But these things don't work as well if you're not made to suggest things. Censoring bad language, nudity and violence is not an activity just for prudes and moralists; it also forces filmmakers to work harder. Roman Polanski directs and makes room for his typical grotesquery. One scene in a morgue shows us a naked corpse as set decoration: it just lies there, almost out of sight. Why? If Polanski wanted to shock us, why didn't he give us a full view? Why distract the audience from the main action? Another scene is unintentionally campy. I can't describe it fully without spoiling a surprise, but it's the one where Nicholson repeatedly slaps Dunaway. Her line seems worthy of 'Mommie Dearest.'",Null,2,5,9 December 2006
X-Men," The usual tedious superhero blockbuster for humorless, fun-hating fanboys
","Fanboys have no sense of fun. It's partly their influence that makes these superhero tales increasingly self-important and witless. If you flip through comic books today, you'll find they tackle issues such as drug addiction, street crime, racial bigotry and homosexuality, all while muscle-bound louts in circus costumes are flying around and shooting laser beams out of their fists. And no one fights crime any more; they just wrestle with their own demons. I recently scanned a comic book where an old Superman and a young Superman were throwing trucks and boulders at each other as they screamed pop-psych jargon about their grievances in what seemed like an apocalyptic episode of 'Dr. Phil.'This movie opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp—yes, a superhero movie with a realistic Nazi concentration camp—where we meet the villain Magneto as a boy, who discovers his ability to move metal with his mind. Once we're in the present (or the 'near-future'), we see the U.S. Senate debating on whether mutants like Magneto should be exposed and listed on a public register. It's like the yellow stars and number-tattoos Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany. Get it? I don't. How is a fear of Jews parallel to a fear of people who can walk through walls, shoot fire out of their eyes or control the weather with their minds? In this movie the earnest idealists are against the mutant registry and the snooty hypocrites are in favor of it. Frankly I'm with the snooty hypocrites. What would we do if there were real super-powered mutants among us? Thanks to the fanboys' thirst for 'realism' even in comic book adventures, the issues of Wolverine and his ilk are made to seem like urgent social problems.Fanboys have no sense of humor either. A sense of humor is not the ability to laugh at everything, but knowing when something is funny and when it isn't. Fanboys have nerd-humor. Nerd-humor comes from the desire to condescend to the very thing that one takes deeply seriously. It comes out in this movie when Logan (later to be Wolverine) mocks silly superhero names like Cyclops and Storm. 'What's your name,' he says to Professor Xavier, who uses a wheelchair, 'Wheels?' This sounds like the movie spoofing itself, but it isn't. It's the movie congratulating itself for being aware of its own absurdities; and once it acknowledges them, it can dismiss them and take itself all the more seriously. This is in contrast to the 1960s TV show 'Batman,' which really was a spoof. But a fanboy doesn't get it, not even if you tell him the joke. 'Yeah, I know it's a spoof, but what kind of Batman has a pot belly?'Marvel Comics used to have a jaunty sense of fun, but that's the company that introduced social relevance and superheroes who have everyday problems just like us. The DC Comics concept of heroes that are larger than life is dead and now even Batman and Superman have 'issues.' This opinion will guarantee me 0 of 564 useful votes, but I think the ultimate superhero show is the wonderfully ludicrous cartoon series 'Challenge of the SuperFriends' (now on DVD). It's funny, fast-paced and entertaining in a way that a movie like this never could be.'X-Men' (the word 'the' was dropped so that no one would give up on the title before he finished reading it) offers the usual fare for fans of fantasy blockbusters: great old actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan) spouting nonsense; younger actors delivering dismal wisecracks ('You're a dick!'); rapid cutting so that we're unable to savor a performance or believe that an actor is making more than one move at a time during a fight sequence; CGI out the wazoo; grand-looking sets and fabulous sound design for those who want their junk to look and sound good; and overblown music.Obviously I don't like the movie, but it could have been far worse. I watched the whole thing; whereas I shut off 'The Fantastic Four' ('The Fantastic 4'? 'Fntstc 4'?) after 30 minutes. And I was amazed how compelling and subtle Anna Paquin could be in a sea of SFX. I kept wishing she and Hugh Jackman would steal away from the freak show, sit down at a coffee shop and just talk for 90 minutes.",Null,9,15,7 December 2006
The Village," A silly 'Twilight Zone'-like plot chokes off the affecting love story in its subplot, for a very disappointing Shyamalan effort
","This is a bad half-hour 'Twilight Zone' episode padded to 108 minutes. Except the padding itself is actually pretty good.The people of an isolated village are cut off from the rest of the world by their fear of the strange creatures that surround them in the woods. But the creatures seem to break their years-old alliance with the villagers when they breach the barrier between them and mutilate animals to show their displeasure.The director M. Night Shyamalan and his photographer Roger Deakins have given us yet another beautiful-looking movie, which also boasts a fine score by James Newton Howard. The ensemble cast, which includes William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver among the village elders, is fine. I didn't much care for Adrien Brody as a quirky simpleton. It's a shallow performance, though competent enough to do no major damage.What kills the movie is Shyamalan's godawful script. It includes not one but two twist endings. The first twist is so predictable that he'd have been better off just revealing it to us from the beginning. Shyamalan would have had an easier time making it all plausible if he weren't so taxed with the effort of concealing his surprise. As it is, there are far too many things that don't make sense.The second twist ending is so ludicrous, he should have jettisoned it in the first rewrite. Shyamalan makes the whole movie feel like amateur night with this silly stunt-ending and by picking the worst possible moment to make his cameo appearance. He comes off like a self-satisfied magician winking at his audience as he reveals his trick and cocks his ear for the applause; all we're doing is groaning and rolling our eyes.When I said the padding is actually good, I'm talking about the love story between Joaquin Phoenix and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard. Their story is warm and affecting. Too bad it's choked off by a lot of dumb gimmicks.",Null,1,2,4 March 2005
Psycho," A Hitchcock masterpiece—thanks to Bernard Herrmann
","'Psycho' ranks second on a list of Alfred Hitchcock's four masterpieces, following 'Vertigo' and followed by 'North by Northwest' and 'Rear Window,' which ranks number four only because it lacks a Bernard Herrmann score. While Hitch's camera is always the best feature of his films, Herrmann is the artist who puts three of them over the top and into the realm of true greatness—setting them beyond such near-great movies as 'Notorious' and 'Strangers on a Train,' which both had good scores, but nothing like the sublime and haunting music of this film. There is no underestimating Hitchcock, nor the work of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, who play the film's two main characters; but without Herrmann this could not have been a great movie.The opening scene is the best place to appreciate both Herrmann and Hitchcock. Joseph Stefano's script is extremely well-structured and it was his idea to make Marion Crane the story's main character, before switching over forty minutes later to Norman Bates. (In the original novel, Robert Bloch dispatches Mary Crane much sooner.) But his dialogue is often stilted, and the opening scene, where Marion and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) share a lunchtime tryst in a cheap hotel, is badly written. The fault is made worse by Gavin, whose performance is stiff and awkward throughout, nowhere more than here. Yet this scene is among the glories of the movie, with the camera, the music and Janet Leigh's performance all giving it an aching poignancy that haunts our minds long after the film is over. Our sense of Marion's longing and frustration, which could not be conveyed by Leigh alone, is necessary for us to understand why she commits the rash act of stealing money from her boss's client. Watch how much is conveyed to us by the camera when Marion suddenly rises from the bed. Listen how much is conveyed by Herrmann's music when Sam spreads out his hands in mock-surrender and says, 'All right.' The scene as written would seem unworkable in other hands; in the hands of Herrmann and Hitchcock (and Leigh) it becomes masterly.Gus Van Sant's remake, a fascinating failure, helps us appreciate many things about this film, including the performances—even, perversely, the performances of Gavin and Vera Miles, who plays Marion's sister, Lila. Gavin is incompetent and Miles is thoroughly competent, but both have the same effect on us: we don't care about them. Or rather, we would be bored by them if they were doing anything other than solving the mystery of Marion's disappearance. Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore give these bland characters more dimension, and in doing so, annoy us with their distracting personalities. Characters that are deliberately featureless often excite our imaginations more than ones that are full of tedious quirks. As is so often true with old movies, their 'faults' prove to be virtues when remakes attempt to correct them.Oddly, I vividly remember everything about the Van Sant film, except for Vince Vaughn's performance as Norman Bates; I only remember that at the time I thought it was excellent. Anne Heche, by contrast, was memorably awful, especially in the one scene that enhances our appreciation of Janet Leigh. When Marion is in her apartment alone (and without any monologue), packing her things and worrying about her mad plan, Leigh conveys all the anxiety in her decision with a minimum of affectation. But Heche not only makes the putrid decision to play the scene as if she is half-amused by her own craziness; she conveys this idea with the maximum of overplaying, as if she were compensating for her lack of dialogue with broad gestures and eye-rolling. Leigh shows us how she feels; Heche announces it over a megaphone.Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is among the most memorable ever recorded on film. He is sympathetic and frightening; innocent and malign; horrifyingly unlike us and even more horrifyingly like us. Stefano gives him the best lines; and Hitchcock's camera is preternaturally adept at drawing us into his world when necessary and then coldly keeping us distant when needed. Yet with all this, how much more than a satisfying thriller with a clever trick ending could 'Psycho' have been without Herrmann's score to help it transcend itself? Could Norman Bates have haunted us as much with a merely excellent score, like the ones for 'Strangers on a Train' and 'Frenzy'? Neither Bloch nor Stefano is Shakespeare, and Norman Bates does not live on the page, as Macbeth, Edmund and Iago do. Could Norman Bates, like Shakespeare's characters, live for four-hundred more years? If he survives, it will have been the joint genius of Perkins, Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann that rendered him, and his story, an immortal nightmare.",Null,12,17,7 December 2006
Rosemary's Baby," Great fun: a film that takes the best part of any horror movie and makes it the whole show
","I saw this at a revival theater a few years ago, and it was one of the best times I've had at the movies. I won't post any spoilers, but I recommend that you read nothing about this movie before you see it. Part of my pleasure was in expecting a certain event to occur earlier in the film: I thought 'Rosemary's Baby' was going to be about a rampaging demon baby. This misconception helped keep me gripped in suspense until the end.Now that I've watched it again on DVD, I can appreciate it as well as enjoy it. Here's why it was so fun: my favorite part of any horror film is first twenty minutes or so leading up to the first appearance of the monster. It doesn't matter how enjoyable the monster is; the best part is always the wait. This principle works in such diverse films as 'Them!' (waiting for the killer ants), 'King Kong' ( for the giant ape), 'Psycho' ( for the shower scene) and so on. 'Rosemary's Baby' is all wait, and it's marvelously effective. (But does a monster finally appear at the end? See the movie.)Roman Polanski directs his own script based on Ira Levin's novel (which I read later and enjoyed); he is extremely clever at tantalizing us and dropping clues. Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and her actor-husband Guy (John Cassavetes) have moved into a new apartment in an old 19th century building which has a bad reputation for murders and strange deaths that occur on its premises. They befriend the old couple (Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer) next door who are nosy and eccentric but later seem more sinister. When Rosemary gets pregnant, she begins to suspect her neighbors are witches.The casting is important. Rosemary must be weak-willed but not so passive that she becomes irritating or unsympathetic: Mia Farrow is perfect. Cassavetes plays an unsympathetic jerk yet allows us to see his moral struggle, mainly hidden from his wife (and only suggested to the audience). Sidney Blackmer seems gracious and charming, yet conveys something dark underneath. Ruth Gordon steals the show, a wacky oddball who becomes terrifying.Roman Polanski delivers a slowly-paced film that screws our attention to the sticking place for two hours and fifteen minutes. You can't ask for more fun than that.",Null,2,4,12 December 2006
Bruce Almighty," Even God thinks Jim Carrey is God's gift to comedy in this repulsive effort
","Whenever I watch Jim Carrey I get the feeling he's grabbing me by the collar, slamming his face into mine and screaming, 'Laugh at me! Laugh at me, goddammit, laugh!' His efforts to be funny seem so desperate and sweaty, yet for many people it works. For instance, the DVD for this movie includes an outtake where Carrey improvises with baking utensils. Director Tom Shadyac cites this as an example of Carrey's genius, but it reminded me of another exhausting comic, Carrot Top.Even without Carrey, the premise of 'Bruce Almighty' would be charmless. Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is a Buffalo newscaster assigned to featherweight stories like the creation of the world's largest cookie. When the anchorman at his station retires, he feels he has a good chance to get promoted to the job. Instead, it goes to his loathed rival Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), a fact that he learns while doing a live report from Niagara Falls. This results in a bitter on-air hissy fit in which he insults a little old lady on a tour boat and delivers the f-word right to the camera. Naturally, he's fired. This sets off a chain of events that climax with a group of thugs beating him and vandalizing his car. He blames God for this terrible run of bad luck. God, played by Morgan Freeman in a gleaming white suit, is inordinately angered and teaches Bruce a lesson by letting him take over the job of being the Almighty. Bruce uses these new powers to teach his dog how to use the toilet, give his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) bigger breasts, return to his old job in a blaze of glory – and humiliate his rivals, especially Baxter.The script makes a few feeble stabs at making Bruce seem other than the raging egomaniac and obnoxious jerk he clearly is. He helps a blind man at one point; he kinda-sorta answers some prayers. But he's mainly unsympathetic; and it seems horrific that God would give this man nearly unlimited powers just to get him to appreciate his girlfriend and learn a dubious theological lesson or two. What about all the other people affected by Bruce's antics? When Bruce inadvertently brings about tidal waves on the other side of the globe, we briefly see a TV news report showing the people harmed by this disaster. How many were killed?God helpfully explains this favoritism near the end when he tells Bruce he has the gift of making people laugh. I would have said he has the ability to slam his fist down people's throats and rip out the laughs in bloody heaps.Honestly, I thought Jerry Lewis was the ultimate comedian-narcissist, but not even Lewis had God fawn over his own genius; still less was there a God who let him bumble his way into destroying the lives of those who evidently aren't hilarious enough to receive special treatment.This movie would have been so much more tolerable – for me, if not Carrey fans – if Bruce had been played by someone more likable. Just look at God Himself to see what casting can do. Morgan Freeman can tell us that a real miracle is when 'a teenager says 'no' to drugs and 'yes' to an education' and make that crap sound like wisdom. In fact, what if the part of Bruce had been retooled for an elderly man so that Freeman could play *both* parts?I know, I know. Jim Carrey is a huge box office draw, and Freeman is not. If the real God ever decides to exert himself over trivia, maybe he ought to look into that little injustice.",Null,22,40,13 April 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A newbie's perspective on 'The Return of the King'
","I haven't read the J.R.R. Tolkien books or seen the first two movies in this series, so I won't waste your time with a formal review. Here are some miscellaneous thoughts from the perspective of a Middle Earth neophyte:If you're wondering if you can understand this movie without having seen the first two, you can. I didn't realize I was watching the third installment until the end when I saw there couldn't possibly be any more story. I had a little trouble here and there, but the movie never really lost me.Roger Ebert complained that characterization in these movies is given short shrift. Maybe so, but I thought Mr. Frodo and Sam – and the love they had for each other – were very moving. For me, they were the heart of this movie. I was roused into anger when Gollum framed Sam and temporarily split the two men – are Hobbits men? – apart.Everyone says it, and everyone's right. Gollum is a great villain; it's a great performance by Andy Serkis and the CGI craftsmen who jointly created him. I loved to hate Gollum.Is that woman who chafes at not being able to fight alongside the men a character from Tolkien's books? She's such a tedious action movie cliché – or would be if the actress playing her weren't so convincing and charming. She even ends up a genuine threat to a character who cannot die by any man, because of a technicality: she's not a man. That reminded me of the dreary moment in 'Jurassic Park' when Helen Hunt cracks on Jeff Goldblum for talking about Man as if the term somehow excluded women. (Genesis: 'And God created Man, male and female.')I was very impressed with the special effects. Yes, they were awesome in themselves. But it's also impressive that they existed to tell the story – a rare feat these days when the story usually exists to service the effects. Still, the effects – while never overwhelming the story – sometimes overwhelmed themselves. Ebert gave special praise to the giant spider, but by the time it arrived I was already so sated with CGI monsters that this one didn't seem inordinately frightening. (Incidentally, Ebert says the spider scenes marked the best movie battle between giant insect and man, but these scenes – good as they are – don't replace the much lower-tech 'Them!')I'm not in love with Peter Jackson's directing style. His camera is always sweeping around the scenery, which is almost invariably SFX-laden, as if to say, 'Nothing up my sleeve!'Viggo Mortensen is supposed to be a major star of this series, but he makes little impression on someone watching just this entry. Elijah Wood – with his enormous eyes and beguiling presence – feels like the protagonist. Orlando Bloom also has little to do, but unlike Mortensen he makes a bad impression. When we see him in closeup the only thought that seems to be roaming his mind is: 'Aren't I pretty?'What is it about some of these great old men of the theater – men like Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris – and here, Ian McKellan? One of them can just stand on screen for five seconds and even if you've never seen him before, you think, 'Wow, what a great actor.'Someone made a terrific comment on the message board for this movie, and it deserves to be read:'When anything becomes a 'craze' it tends to annoy those of us who enjoyed the material quietly and non-fanatically before it was a fad. When I was a young teen I actually had kind of a love-hate thing with George Lucas because when 'Star Wars' became popular it was suddenly 'cool' to like science fiction, and those of us who had liked it all along were assumed to be part of that herd.'I first read 'The Lord of the Rings' in my freshman year of high school (25 years ago now) and I have liked it ever since. I was glad to see the movies done, enjoyed them well, and plan to watch them again throughout the years. And though I suppose the advertising hype was necessary so the producers' gamble could pay off, I am glad it's over. Now the fad-of-the-month club people can move on to something else, and let me enjoy something I like in peace.'She was deriding both the people who obsessively love and abuse the movie. If the craze really is over, this might be a good time for a newbie to visit these movies. I saw this one, and despite my minor complaints, I loved it.",Null,6,9,27 April 2005
Donnie Darko," Obscure and pretentious sci-fi semi-thriller; the box office was bad, but a loyal cult grossly overrates it
","The satire is strained and self-satisfied. The scene where the title character berates his teacher for having too simplistic a philosophy sounds like adolescent score-settling.The plotting is dreary. Just when things are about to get exciting, the pace slackens and we have to wait several minutes for things to pick up again.The realistic touches are unbearable. The dinner table banter between brother and sister? The boorish friends' conversation about Smurfs? The dialogue for these scenes is listed on IMDb's 'memorable quotes' page. Why? We have this half-formed idea that lame insults, or over-serious debates about pop culture refuse, are somehow 'ironic.' And that anything realistic is worth inserting into a movie.Yet, by the end of 'Donnie Darko' I was somewhat won over. I enjoyed the complicated plot twists, some of the strange images and Michael Andrews's splendid electronic score. But the small cult that champions this film grossly overrates it.Jake Gyllenhaal plays a paranoid schizophrenic named Donnie Darko, who gets along badly with his family, with his teachers and with his classmates; but he does manage to find a sympathetic friend in Gretchen (Jena Malone), who agrees to date him; and he has a compassionate psychiatrist (Katharine Ross), who discovers hypnosis is the means to unlock hidden secrets. His other companion may not be a true ally. Donnie has a friend named Frank, who is either a large purple bunny, or man in a large purple bunny costume. Either way, Donnie is the only one who can see him.Richard Kelly, who wrote, directed and created a webpage to explain everything in a tantalizingly opaque way, seems to think he's being a lot deeper than he is. This is one of those movies that inspire obsessed fans to demand that you see the film many times over, study the obsessed fans' websites about the movie, become an expert on the movie—and only then are you allowed to say you don't like it. Except, in their circular reasoning, not liking it is a sign you haven't studied it enough.This is not 'Hamlet.' Much of the opacity of this movie is the result of sloppiness and pretentiousness. Take the engine that falls off the plane and destroys Donnie's room. Kelly seems to want to leave open the possibility that much of what's happening is all in Donnie's mind and that there is a rational explanation for everything. If so, why present us with an undeniably supernatural event? The plane literally comes out of nowhere.Does the above criticism reveal that I don't get it? Nothing about the movie inspires me to delve deeper into its mystery. I was somewhat entertained, but its cult can have it.",Null,31,56,14 February 2007
