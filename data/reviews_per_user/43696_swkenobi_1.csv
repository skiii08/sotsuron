National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Different but as good as the first!
","Just saw it and while there were some details that could've been in it, it was true to the first and left open another movie. All the actors were excellent, great interaction and good lines for all.I thought both Ed Harris and Helen Mirren were wonderful additions. Not quite as thought provoking as the original, but just as good in a different way.Excellent scenery, with Mt. Rushmore, Paris and London as well as different parts of DC this time. The pace was very good and never felt like the movie dragged, just like the first one.Definitely a must see this season.",8,2,4,23 December 2007
