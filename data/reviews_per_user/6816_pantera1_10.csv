Mission: Impossible III," Mission improbable
","Saw MI -III today. Well that's 2 hours of my life gone forever. The first and second had a modicum of charm but this, oh god this.. Much has been made of the emotional quotient TC to his friends, Tom Cruise to me, shows in this film. Whoopee do!! It gives him a reason to get teary eyed every couple of minutes. Reminds me of William Hurt in that film about newscasters who could cry on demand.... And so it goes with Tom. He plays cocky too well but give him emotional? His wife in this looks identical to his real one, sans the pregnancy pillow/bump that was used. I had to wait till the credits to find out it wasn't her. PSH or as I like to call him Phil Seymour Hoffman is a different matter. My god this guy gives gravitas and power. Even though it's popcorn he's a magical brooding presence. A Donald Sutherland or Christopher Plummer (two overused and underrated magicians) of the future. Story is basically baddie wants to get some Asterix like potion to sell to some other bad guys and tom/ethan's got to save the world.Does he? I won't spoil that for you.JJ Abrams directed this and it shows. TMA.(Or as Ken Levine would say TOO MANY AIRDUCTS!) As a big screen blockbuster at times it has a claustrophobic, televisual feel to it. And the editing. Around the World in eighty days did it more elegantly. We don't need to see the passport check in but come on...The publicity extravaganza @ this has been intense and I can see why; if you make enough noise, they will come. But only once. Second week isn't going to be that hot.Can wait for MI 4",6,0,0,18 May 2006
The Prestige," Magic Show
","Antici..................................pation! ( With apologies to the Rocky Horror etc,etc.)The Prestige is the third act in a magic show where the magic is presented. (The first two are called the pledge and the turn)The basic premise is of two magicians at the end of the 19th Century who become mortal enemies over a woman. And, as important, their rivalry in search of the greatest magic trick. And naturally the dilemma of what you can lose when you want to win, damn the consequences. The protagonists are superbly played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, ably supported by Michael Caine and assisted by Scarlet (why her, again?) Johannssen.Bale who was the boy in the exquisite EMPIRE OF THE SUN (9/10) and, of course, the not so personable anti-hero in American PSYCHO (8/10) as well as the latest Batman incarnation, is growing into his roles. He is on the cusp of A list status and thoroughly deserves it. This film is like an exotic buffet; exquisitely crafted, beautifully presented with oddities and interests available throughout. Moody and electric, it captures the time and era beautifully. It is another feather in the amazing Christopher (MEMENTO (9/10) Nolan's cap. He's become a name director that you can trust with your hard-earned moolah.Especially interesting in reality was the whole story of the Edison/Tesla feud which was only touched on here. Tesla was basically the person who invented AC current and then was shafted by Edison. Watch for an interesting cameo appearance here. And Andy (gollum) Serkis in a non-digitized role.THE PRESTIGE was really magic.",9,7,11,12 February 2007
The Fountain," Trickle not treat
","Should any husband be allowed to direct his wife in love scenes? (Apart from home video/DVDs with their questionable production values. ) If he's not explicit enough people shout 'cheat!' If he's too explicit then one questions his own limit setting. That I guess was one of the dilemmas (but not the least) facing Daniel Aronowsky with his filming of his wife Rachel Weisz in his new film THE FOUNTAIN.Daniel Aronowsky directs this multi leveled/ layered story of a tale of love and the quest for immortality through the ages; on a physical, scientific and spiritual level. It's set at the time of the conquistadors, the present day and in a timeless state. And if that sounds a little confusing, well that's because it is; until at least a good half hour into the film.One gets the feeling that the editing process must have been a 'sturm und drang' performance, with time changes, scene changes, reversals in time sequences all taking part. And the script is not as tight as it could be despite multiple revisions greater than a south African history textbook. This film has been a labour of love for him, it having first being proposed and worked on since the late '90's. Initially the Hugh Jackman role was to be played by Brad Pitt who pulled out at the last minute, causing the whole project to collapse. Cate Blanchett also pulled out, causing him to re-cast his wife in her role. I guess he just wanted someone he'd be sure wouldn't abandon him in the end. It's like his own FITZCARRALDO (8/10) So, after all that, did I like the film? Some of the set pieces were really quite beautiful, given the relatively small budget. And Hugh Jackman gives a pleasantly overwrought performance. Rachel Weisz, A Rhodes? graduate isn't really all that interesting in this- back to the old problem of directing family. And I would have loved to have seen more of Stephen McHattie who played the Chief Inquisitor. But I guess that will come with the deleted scenes, extra length special edition. Back to the over editing/ strange cuts that occurred throughout.But overall, no. This isn't a film that is going to get me waiting fervently for the special edition DVD. . The film reminded me of SOLARIS(8/10) especially in the way it ambled through the space sequences in an almost zen-like trance. SOLARIS was also a film that initially didn't grab me by the short and curlies initially, but grew on me from a second viewing.While I can't say I was too excited about it in toto, this is a film which will have its proponents and fierce opponents. Enjoy the debate.",6,0,2,30 January 2007
The Departed," Departed has left the building, stratospherically
","The world is divided into two; those who believe Scorcese has been victimised and deliberately ignored in the Oscar stakes and those who think he's trying a little tooooo hard to worm his way into the Oscar Academy's graces. Okay, so TAXI DRIVER (9/10) could've won but it was also against NETWORK (9/10) and the eventual winner ROCKY (9/10). And who could forget the incredible KING OF COMEDY(10/10) with Bob De Niro playing the wanna be standup Rupert Pupkin with Jerry Lewis playing the straight man.Yes, with his last two films, you watched them and go 'so what?' GANGS(6/10) was almost camp in some of its violence with the cartoonish Daniel Day Lewis , while THE AVIATOR (6/10) made one look on in horror at Leo De caprio's miscasting. And made you wonder what the hell he saw in Leo apart from his pretty blue eyes? He's back. This is gangster opera. Ebbing and flowing through a sometimes complex film with more crosses( and double ones) than a Lourdes shrine. And put any TITANIC (6/10) misconceptions to rest; this film shows Leo can act. He plays an undercover cop, Billy Costigan, who goes so deep that he finds it hard to come back. An emotional tour de force, and force majeur. Makes me look forward to seeing BLOOD DIAMOND in the coming year.The basic premise is of undercover infiltrations into the violent ganglands of Boston; not the first natural milieu for the genre you'd think of, in this most mayflower of cities. Jack Nicholson plays a crime boss who does it as much for the love of the game as for the profit it brings. Matt Damon is an ambitious cop with plans for the future which take him outside of the force. But his past won't free him and he knows it. An at times unbearably tense film, it gripped me throughout.Great support by Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, alec Balwin, Ray Winstone and the not so insignifcant love interest Vera Farmiga.And expect to see Marty up on the stage come February 25th, with his cheeks shining with tears and Jack in the front row, slow clapping him up with his trademarked grin.",9,0,0,16 January 2007
Downfall," Should be called DAS BUNKER
","This film should be called DAS BUNKER. A film both physically and metaphorically claustrophobic. Like DAS BOOT, one also gets glimpses of the outside world and the possibilities that could occur, but won't. It chronicles the last days of Hitler and selected cronies as they watch the world they created vanish around them.Hitler is extraordinarily played by the actor Bruno Ganz, most famously seen in an antonym of this role as an angel in WINGS OF DESIRE. In the same way that Germany needed an outsider to motivate their militarism and eventual destruction, so has Oliver Hirschbiegel employed a foreigner(Ganz is Swiss) to depict this most deplored of dictators. He is humanised here- no Bokassesque cannibalism here. There were times he could be kind and, horror of horrors, even loved his dog! And not even in the biblical sense. But evil has always had a deceptive face and the depiction of the orderly, ordinary world is chilling in view of all that we know.The film is taken from the diaries and observations of, amongst others, Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge here ably played by Alexandra Maria Lara- an innocent? amongst wolves. At times there is almost a fly on the wall feel to the film. At two and a half hours it's no slouch but I didn't feel it. Take a big pack of popcorn a strong bladder and prepare for one of the finest films of the year.",9,0,3,8 December 2005
Lord of War," Boy meets tank. Falls in lust...
","Yuri Orlov(Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian boy from the wrong side of the tracks 0r, as he puts it more succinctly, 'the end of the line.' He comes from a family where to survive they've had to lie just to leave the old country, just to find its not too peachy on the other side. He finds a niche in arms dealing, initially small stuff and works his way into the big leagues. Cage plays him in his usual laconic style, making him a likable anti-hero, even when you know you can't possibly agree with him. It's not that he doesn't necessarily know what's wrong or right, but that he has come to the realisation that if he doesn't do it, it's not going to make the slightest bit of difference. His brother, played by Jared Leto, is along for the ride till he can't stomach it any longer and opts out, a broken wasted man. Ethan Hawke (seen in the Niccol directed GATTACA) is an interpol agent who is determined to bring down YuriAlong the way we are given a couple of truths about the industry and reminders. Among them the most startling is that the number of gun shops in the US outstrips the number of McDonalds. Scary stats. Even these hustlers with their multimillion dollar deals skating on the edge of the law, wouldn't be missed if they disappeared, in relation to the countries with their multi billion dollar industries. The writer and director, Andrew Niccol, was responsible for both THE TRUMAN SHOW and GATTACA; both original in concept and beautifully realised. In common, their central character ends up having to fight for his choice, damn the consequences. Yuri is apparently based on an amalgamation of the stories of five different arms dealers. The film found difficulty getting produced, with its off-beat and controversial theme. With the nomination season coming up, I'd like to see it getting at least a best original screemnplay nod. A real original in a year of some poor copies( HERBIE) and some downright turkeys (DUKES OF HAZZARD).",9,1,3,11 December 2005
The Queen," Ladies and gentlemen, The Queen
","Many moons ago (around 11 years ago) we were in Durban at the same time as HRH's re-visit to South Africa. Amongst other functions, she was going to the horse races . So as a public service, to myself and to see if she looked anything like her pictures, I went to see her. It ended up being one of those muggy, rainy days where the days races ended up being cancelled. (Which with my luck on the nags ended up probably being a good thing.)But she came anyway an did a walkabout for those of us who stayed around. And, without being a royalist in any form, she impressed; A true presence.Helen Mirren, who has been around for donkey's years does the same here. She plays the Queen as someone whos life is their duty and vice versa. And sometimes it's difficuilt to know where one begins and ends. This is not someone that one cosies up to in any shape or form, as Charles makes clear in one of his comments to her.Michael Sheen plays Tony Blair in a picture perfect portrayal in his mannerisms of the time and of a Prime Minister getting used to the reins of power.Helen Mirren was an excellent choice to play her and her resemblance after make-up is incredible. She has always played an aloof/knowledgeably superior character; from films like THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER (8/10), Peter Greenway's meisterwerk and in the incredible TV series PRIME SUSPECT in her role as inspector Tennison.The film takes place during the week of Diana's death with all the dramas surrounding it. It goes someway in explaining the Royal families reaction and the characters present. Was it really a tipping point for the monarchy or was it a case of journalistic excess? I don't think so but it makes for an entertaining film with some interesting insights into the royal and ministerial households with their totally different styles; one stuck in a unyielding past and the other a more labile, relaxed future.As with my prediction for Scorcese to win for THE DEPARTED (9/10) in the Oscars, I would suggest a flutter on Mirren as a sure thing for best actress. Unlike my horse racing tips, you just can't lose.",7,0,0,16 January 2007
Casino Royale," A royal treat
","The 'original' Casino Royale nearly destroyed the genre with its spoof take on the whole aspect. (by the time NEVER SAY NEVER (6/10) came around the franchise was pretty much impermeable). It was called charles feldman's CASINO ROYALE- more appropriate would've been Marty Feldman's...THis ROYALE came from the Broccollis wanting to re-jig the franchise. Even though the last couple of Bonds have been monetarily pretty successful, they wanted to try something new. (I guess when someone gets too popular they want to start demanding gross points on profits a la Tom Cruise and you can't have that in the caring/sharing world of movie production. ) And they came up with their new Bond. Whereas they had rugged Bond in Sean connery, Teflon Bond in Roger Moore, anxious Bond in Timothy Dalton, bemused Bond in George Lazenby, smooth Bond in Pierce B now we welcome the world to barrowboy Bond. And he's not really eye candy for the fairer sex, lets be honest. And for gods sake, does anyone really wear those swimming trunks? In his acting style he is an intense, superb classical actor with an intense credibility but with the romantic skills of Gollum.The story has gone micro here. Whereas before we've had Blofeld and company wanting nothing less than to rule the world, here we have accounting villain. Like Enron but on a much, much smaller scale. But the screenplay by Paul Haggis (CRASH 9/10) is good, crisp, witty and a pleasure to view.The main villain played by uber Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen has lost a couple of bucks because of Bond's interference and is trying to win it back. And he doesn't even cheat!! What kind of villainy is that? I want my money back! (or rather he does). In the Bond villain stakes he's a little too human, but I guess that's what the director wanted to convey.And the Bond girls are either beautiful and can't act (Caterina Murino) or can act and just don't cut it in the gorgeous stakes (Eva Green). She is more goth than gorgeous.Where this film really takes off is in the action sequences. There are some spectacular set pieces including the most breath taking chase I've ever seen. If you've seen better, please let me know. This film is as exhausting as a trip to the gym with the side benefit of popcorn. And comfy chairs.Judi Dench plays Dame Judi Dench as always. (Shouldn't she have played THE QUEEN?). And thankfully no John Cleese as Q. I love the Python's to a fault but him as Q was utterly gratuitously pointless.Some of the product placement was a little ungracious. (A rolex? No Omega.) And I guess we'll all want Sony Ericsson's after this. And Bond driving a Ford (Maybe if he's been tied up and put in the boot..) But the star product of course was the Aston. After the BMW's tacky range its a welcome return.Overall an interesting addition to the genre.",8,0,3,16 January 2007
Fantastic Four," A great adaptation of a classic comic book
","There are some pretty awfully spawned adaptations of comic superheroes. Happily,this isn't one of them. A well crafted screenplay by Mark Frost and Michael France (who wrote the unfortunate Hulk) takes us through the characters transformation from ordinary hard working astrophysicists into superheroes. Ioan Gruffudd after coming to prominence in the Hornblower series, takes his first blockbuster leading role and does a sterling job (with obligatory mid Atlantic accent). But Julian McMahon ( another import- Aussie this time) steals the show as a sympathetic Victor Von Doom. Unlike the latest Harry Potter wizbangfest, you can watch this from alpha to omega without feeling something is missing. My only question is why oh why Jessica Alba as an uber scientist? I have the feeling it's her to blame for the initial radiation problem but can't prove it....",7,0,4,8 December 2005
The Island," No man is an island. Or is he?
","Ewan Mcgregor's come a long way since his breakthrough role in TRAINSPOTTING (8/10). And boy has he had fun doing it. He's played dancers, and sung (successfully), played soldiers and star warriors, cartoons and crooks. In fact the only commonality is that they are all so different. But the one thread that runs through is that he's just so goddamn likable! In this film he plays a human clone,Lincoln Six Echo, who comes to have a sense of awareness; an awakening sensibility. He starts having bad dreams that have no sense of continuity with his own memories. And the story is of his relationship with Jordan (played surprisingly well by Scarlett Johannsenn) and his own growing awareness.It's pretty easy to tell the good guys from the bad ones; going back to Tom Mix cowboy films, the good guys are in white and the bad guys in black. Actually some of the good guys eventually do dress in black so lets rephrase that; the guys in white are the non sentient and the ones in black have self awareness.Unlike a lot of big action films of now, the acting is of an exceptional calibre and talent list. Whereas the talent in most action films tends to be of porn star calibre, here we have Sean Bean in a major role as well as the cheese monkey Steve Buscemi in a minor but essential one.Djimon Hounsou plays the seeker who has to go out and hunt down. While this role is a relatively ordinary one, he brings gravitas and style to it. He's an extraordinary actor who has been nominated ( and is my pick) for a best supporting actor Oscar after being cruelly ignored in the astounding AMISTAD (9/10).Michael Bay is the bomb. Literally. He lives for the big explosion/ chase scenes. This is the guy who put the arms in Armageddon. (6/10) and the Bad in BAD BOYS. With romantic interplay, you can feel it's very much the second directors job to do that while he does the more exciting stuff.The film has echos of GATTACA (10/10) of a controlled future, where society is controlled and the freedom of choice is taken away for the greater good. It works as an action film and asks a couple of interesting ethical questions along the way. Happily you won't be baying for the directors head after this one.",7,0,1,6 February 2007
