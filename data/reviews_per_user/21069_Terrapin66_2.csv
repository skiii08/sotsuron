It," Disappointing
","Dare I say it, the cheesy 1990 mini-series is far superior. Despite the hype, this adaptation was a real letdown. The kids were great, however the the CGI was awful and the jump scares were cheap.Bill Skarsgard? Hard to tell between him and the CGI.This adaptation was lacking in both exposition and soul. All we have here is a CGI clown terrorising some kids. There is no depth to the story of his origins. There is no proper backstory regarding the kids.There is absolutely none of the feeling of dread that both the book and the original mini-series encapsulated. No atmosphere whatsoever.Its not a bad film, but highly lacking.",5,149,262,9 September 2017
Hereditary," Don't be put off by the 1 star millennial ratings...
","The shock value, dark tone is sunning. The atmosphere alone is worth the price of admission. The acticing is top notch. Toni Collette shines in this as does Milly Shapiro. It's an acting Tour de Force It is a wonderfully pieced together story with mind shattering moments, leaving one with an eternal sense of foreboding. IMDB closed its message boards a while back, which was a good thing. It finally managed to rid itself of the anonymous little trolls. I now firmly believe that the average IMDB commenter, should have to expose themselves prior to being allowed to review a title... Age, gender, country of origin should be displayed in an effort to give the individual the means necessary in which to select said reviews.",9,4,9,19 June 2018
