Hereditary," Horror so good you feel it in your bones
","This is hands down one of the best horror films I have ever seen. The whole movie made me uneasy, it builds tension and suspense on a level I haven't seen in any movie in years. 'The Shinning' comes to mind when I think of really amazing horror, and this is up there with that, possibly past it. I have nothing but good things to say about Hereditary.",10,2,4,6 January 2020
