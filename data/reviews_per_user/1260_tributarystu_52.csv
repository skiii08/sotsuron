The Devil's Advocate," Divinity on a Leash
","Eternity and entertainment, how could one exist without the other? True entertainment only comes without limits.Seeing how my recent obsession with Charlize Theron has intensified in the last few weeks (may be the rather appalling effect of stress and responsibility which makes me want to elude reality), I got around to seeing the so renowned Devil's Advocate.The film as such is a fun ride and, by all means, very well done. It's in the artistic impression it conveys to life and the reality of its tone in the first half that this advocate succeeds in defending a case so easy to lose (forgive the pun). While subtlety may not be its prime method of going about things, the vicious devilishness of the world fits very well in the picture. Yet, it is mainly Charlize's performance which caught my eye and soul, a performance so 'tormentous' it simply made the film worth the watch. My bias is obvious, but I sincerely hope this opinion goes beyond personal taste. Morevoer, it is not only in her performance, but also in her character and its drama that the film gains depth and tension.Keanu's Lomax, although the central character, never manages to truly get off the ground - as in, it never gains true distinctiveness. It would be erroneous of anyone to deem Keanu a brilliant actor, but there's always something more to acting than simply having the skills to do it, that is why I did not mind him being chosen for the role. Actually, he is only the 'vehicle' which gets this film moving, but its value lies more in the peripheral happenings, the little things.As a whole, Devil's Advocate may attach too much of a moral label to itself to actually fulfill its potential. It is however a clever film, with some good performances from both Charlize and Pacino (who does his usual tricks to amuse everyone), but which descends into dangerous territory towards the end. And it's not the right kind of dangerous territory.",7,9,19,27 May 2007
The Blair Witch Project," Some potential, no results
","Does the word boredom vibe with only some specific cords? Because if it does, that would explain how some people have come to worship this (second) hand made movie.'Ooo, it's so scary! Alone in the woods with strange noises! Was that a branch cracking or was it a three headed unicorn with blood dripping teeth?' It's neither sublime, nor psychologically frightening, nor visually captivating, so I simply can not comprehend for which reasons someone may have enjoyed this production. There's one thing worth admiring and that's got nothing to do with the art of film-making, but with the art of money making. I suppose you can turn any piece of junk into an underground myth as long as people will go along with it.Evil Dead, so many years older and so much more fresh than Blair Witch, is the main source of inspiration and I'm not saying it just because it's another movie that takes place in a forest. Maybe, but just maybe, BW could've been something more. Maybe it had some potential, but given that I've seen good movies with terrible premises and disastrous movies with brilliant premises you have to concur that, in the end, this just doesn't matter. Blair Witch is a scare less, brainless, talentless (a bit authentic, I'll admit) excuse for a film.",4,0,3,2 January 2002
Lucky Number Slevin," Connecting the Dots
","Like any sweet, short story about murder and revenge, 'LNS' likes to connect the dots. It's a healthy principle in screen writing (and in the writing of any sort of story) as long as one knows how to achieve a desired effect. And the desired effect is generally the long lasting effect.LNS is a cool little joint of a movie, studded with stars galore. Which, of course, makes it a pleasurable view. Or at least for me it always does; how else could you define a film with Bruce Willis, Ben Kingsly and (the ever present, if I may say so) Morgan Freeman? Yeah, sure, stars generally ruin movies by being a part of them. But that's only the case if the movie tries to be a serious lesson of morale and virtue. Which LNS does not.And that's why it's cool. A very well conceived popcorn flick, which connects all the dots in their eternal shallowness in the way it should. Nothing too fancy, nothing too subtle. Just enough for a good time. That is, if you enjoy having a good time without thinking too much about it and if you don't let yourself distracted by the twinkling bloody frames.",6,79,160,29 June 2006
Requiem for a Dream," Requiem for a Dream
","It hasn't been easy, watching this Requiem. Aronofsky's second major film is, perhaps, one of the most gruesome stories about solitude and addiction, a shattering first-time experience which may well leave you stranded.Watching it several times has somewhat shifted my original point of view, mainly because there are only so many times you can feel surprised by the brute force of the film. There is no need to put this in unclear terms, Requiem for a Dream is mainly a visual and sensory experience. It's extremely immersive and while some of Aronofsky's techniques may feel gimmicky after a while, the amazing soundtrack by Clint Mansell will keep you at dazzling heights all along. To be frank, I never understood how the exhilarating score just got overlooked by big award ceremonies; its value cannot be disputed now, as many bits of it have been overused of late by so many clips trying to come off as dramatic and intense - which they generally do, because the music is vibrant.For a while, I believed Requiem to be one of the best films ever made. I have since refined this opinion a bit, because such things are bound to happen after a number of viewings if the film is as blunt as this. Yet this is not to be taken in as a negative aspect, but more of a necessary evil. Requiem delivers its messages on several levels, the most obvious one being related to addiction issues. It's worth emphasizing that it doesn't boil down to a matter of drugs, because of the oh-so-many faces of addiction, physical and emotional, to narcotics and emotions. I do feel more affected though by the mesmerizingly sad story of solitude, with Ellen Burstyn leading the way most elegantly. To my mind, Requiem manages to convey this loneliness better than any other work of film I've seen, and its impressions are lasting.For anyone watching the movie for the first time, just be prepared for a rough ride which may well prove to be extremely rewarding. But I wouldn't necessarily go in a second time for the sheer pleasure of it; Requiem just isn't that kind of film, which however does not diminish its merits as it remains one of the best movies of the year - and not only.",9,0,1,1 November 2003
The Ring," The X-Files Revisited
","I had been waiting forward for quite some time to see this movie at the moment I finally did. I was asking myself if it would be just another crappy horror movie, or maybe...something more. Well it's something more. Watching through the movie, I could not stop thinking of The X-Files or The Sixth Sense. The ending does make it rather special though.SPOILERSThe story starts with two friends, two girls. One of them had seen a VHS with a movie which is said to kill you one week after the day you had seen it. And, if you can possibly imagine, as the movie starts it's just that day! The start is quite tough and well made as it will most certainly thrill you if not scare you. The story from now on will follow the fate of three other people, who themselves have watched this wicked cassette. It will be a horror ride.The movie does have an interesting storyline and it does have the necessary scares to keep you glued to the chair(or to your partner). As it is a quality horror movie, which should sustain the 'damage' it has caused, the end isn't all-telling. You would be the unlucky one if your phone rang just after 'the movie'. And if you didn't answer it, then you'd have to live with the scares for one week. Just what happened to a friend of mine. The acting goes well with what is happening and, as I've said(more or less), the couple really does remind me of the X-Files. And this is maybe a weak point of the movie. I mean, it's not that enchanting too look at something and say: Wait a minute! I think I've seen something like this before. It is a lack of originality.As a whole it's a very good piece of work. Not as thrilling as I might have wanted it and a little too unoriginal, but still very good. If you want to be in for some thrilling stuff, then just watch this piece of cinematography. 8/10",6,0,1,19 August 2003
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Possibly the best in the series
","I haven't really changed my mind about this film franchise since I reviewed the last one of the bunch (or the ones before, really), but I've probably reached a point where I don't care that much any more and just hope for some good entertainment. Just to summarize where I'm at: big fan of the games, hugely disappointed by the lack of Resident Evil in the actual films.Frankly speaking, I had a good feeling ever since I saw the trailer. There were quite a few familiar scenes, so I hoped for something tangible from the RE universe to keep me going. Ironically, it's not really the RE characters that make this film feel a bit more related to the games, it's a couple of friendly faces of the 'evil' undead. Excuse me, infected.The story (?) moves on from where it left off and while I couldn't really remember where that was, it seems it had something to do with Alice and her clones and finding the oh-so-clich√©d 'safe haven' in an apocalypse scenario. And really, not much else happens, except a bit of ping-pong between havens, while encountering the odd character that we had seen before in the previous films and some others who are mostly only meat to eat.What surprised me in a positive way was that, had the producers taken a little more time to tie the action together, confer a tiny little bit more depth to the guys and gals on screen, Resident Evil: Afterlife could've counted for a very respectable flick. The way it came out, it just has this feeling of unfulfillment about it that I couldn't shake off.Even so, it gets a passing grade. As mentioned above, the saving grace is two prolonged scenes - Axeman and Wesker fight. While I did keep wondering where one would get an Axeman strolling around Los Angeles, I loved how similar it felt to the game. Also, the shotgun with coins was a nice touch. It was such a fun scene that even the excessive slow motion (and there is a lot of that throughout the film) didn't ruin it. And then, the Wesker scene, where Shawn Roberts took all the effort to make Wesker move and act so like the character in the games that it made my heart skip a beat. Both, very well executed set pieces- as was the intro, actually.To balance that, we had the underwhelming inclusion of Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller) and the ignorable presence of Claire (Ali Larter). Even some of the side characters had more of an impact than these two. But you can't always get what you want, I guess.The positive surprise was complete in that the 3D didn't irritate me the way it usually does. Actually, having seen both versions of the film, it had a more authentic feel than the 2D version. I can't actually complain about how Anderson shot the film, it's just that his way of making things come together is rather superficial. In the end, these films will never really be what the Resident Evil games are, so we have to remember rule #32 and enjoy the little things.",5,0,2,27 November 2010
Casablanca," Splendid
","I thought I had seen a very rare few of the great movies that have been made. I now trust, I was right. SPOILERSCasablanca, a place of transit. People come, people go, like a river that doesn't stop to flow. The circumstances make Casablanca a very important place: France already invaded by the nazi troops, America seems the only way to freedom. Humans reign that city, and humans always have two sides: a sentimental side and a raw picture of themselves. Casablanca is a love story and it is a drama. It is not one of those love stories we get to see nowadays...it is something special, where actually love does not really prevail. It shows that the individual sometimes has to sacrifice himself in order for humanity to win. Some people are capable of such a sacrifice, others are not.Rick and Victor are quite the same kind of people, or at least would've been if they had met sooner. Rick changed after Ilsa left him, and he lost his will to fight...probably because there wasn't anyone to support him, because Ilsa wasn't with him. So, when he took the decision at the end he knew why he did that, and he sacrificed himself. He adapted himself to the life in Casablanca, and was doing well there...until Ilsa came along with her husband...Ilsa was for him Paris, not Casablanca. His time with Ilsa was in Paris. As she left him, he was destroyed, but found the power to keep going. Since then he didn't seem a very friendly character, but he was a good hearted one. His 'donation' for the young couple was an act of greatness, and through that he avoided any 'less pleasent things' for the young lady.
Victor is fighting for freedom, has suffered a lot, but knows to keep his nerve. He has a great will, and psychical strength, and his role is of a pretty great importance. There wasn't only the war all could see, there was also the war of the already conquered countries. This was a more difficult one, and for the ones who dared to take part in it, it usually meant death.
The 'poor' corrupted captain Renault, is a nice character. He is funny, and he is the kind of guy who is on the side of those who have the power. Actually, that is quite cowardly, but he does his job pretty well. He's also got a sense of rightness, but until the end, his job is more important than that. He shows finally that he is a sentimentalist, and that he does know what is right. His decision at the end isn't quite glorious, as he at first warns Strasser, but then, as there weren't any risks involved, he decides to keep to Rick.The actors are just great, and the whole atmosphere of the movie is unique. You will feel your heart beat, you might fall in love with the characters, and you will feel the tense situations. This movie is definitely one of the best I have ever seen, if not the actual best. In a world that hasn't changed much, where money still makes the laws, love is the thing that can make you survive, and win your battles. This movie is touching...this movie is the only real romance movie I have seen, and It showed to me that I was partly wrong asking myself why only older movies are in some movie standings.",9,1,1,11 January 2003
Minority Report," Great work
","First of all, I'd want to say that I admire most of Spielberg's works, and I consider him one of the best directors there are. He did have some disappointing movies, but most of his 'works' were great or even brilliant works, like this here or AI. Examples are many... You should first know a little bit about the story. A man is being chased by the system he trusted, a system based on predictions. These predictions of the so called 'Visioneers' help preventing crimes. As the whole operation is about to go nation wide, problems appear. A small study on the characters would be implied in my opinion.  There's Paul Anderton, represented on screen by the one and only Tom Cruise, who does show us good quality acting. His character is one which you do meet through quite a few films, the kind of guy who lost a son, and who tries through his job to help other people which might suffer similar losses, and who usually feels better because of it. It's a kind of thing such characters do to keep living, to give their life a real sense. Paul is a smart guy, self determined and with good intention. Initially he doesn't have any doubts on the system, but that is just because he is not well informed. He believes he is the head of the  operation, but it is not truly so.    Then, we get to see the humanity in every person, even in him as he finds out he is about to kill someone. He is determined that he was framed, and tries to find out who did it, and why. We then meet an event which is arguable. The fact that there does exist only one future, and that it can not be changed. That is what the Visioneers represent. And the system itself. A future that can not be set under any doubt. Is it really so? I do not believe it is, and it seems that neither does Spielberg. You will see that after viewing the movie.   So there's Anderton. Another important character is Danny Witwer(Colin Farrell), who works for the government. I think he is as smart as Anderton, and he might certainly has more experience in murder cases. He is actually quite alike with him. He wishes justice too, but he has a flaw which is very, very disturbing for some: he is arrogant, and he probably doesn't even know this because he is eager to prove himself. He's a good guy.   Lamar is the so called 'bad guy' here, despite the fact that he is just an old, and self obsessed man...he is all that matters, and his system of course. Anyone who stands in the way goes...well, you know. He is old, and the system is all he lives for. The fact that it might be going nation wide is of critical importance, but what I did not clearly understand is if he wants it or if he doesn't want it to go nation wide. Anyway, as a paradox, he will be the one who will prove that the Visioneers can be wrong.
   The special effects of the movie are great, and I especially enjoyed the whole idea of the film. The spiders were great too, and I must say the same about the acting of all actors.    This movie is new...and still it is old. Many of the ideas we see here have been used in other movies too, but Spielberg makes them look new, and I believe that the success of this movie is mostly because of Steven Spielberg.  I would consider it for the Oscars too, even for the best picture category, though I doubt it will get there. The movie would have been even better, if the end hadn't been quite disappointing. That's how I consider it, because it would have been just right if things had stayed as they were. The role of the wife had been so meaningless, and now the fact that she frees him just doesn't seem right.    The story also points out a pretty important thing. If you agree or not, that's your decision. The system might be perfect, but the mistakes are made by human hands.   Before I end this, there would be one more thing I'd have in mind. Was the choice of the year 2054 totally coincidental? Or maybe, it wasn't...because 1000 years before the Catholic and Orthodox Churches had separated each other. Maybe it's the same thing in the movie. We can see a conflict between generations, and then the fact that the program might go nation wide...it might make them all safe. But it does not happen so, and again everybody is in danger. How it partially was after 1054, because people had been separated again by 'higher' forces. It's just my opinion...might be a coincidence.     As a mark...I'd say somewhere between 8,5 and 9 out of 10. I consider it a certain 'must-see'.",9,1,2,29 December 2002
Citizen Kane," As expected
","Citizen Kane...I was really anxious in watching this film, as it is considered one of the best, if not the best, movie ever. These considerations are not made upon nothing, and I do agree Citizen Kane is one of the best movies I have seen.SPOILERSWe have the idea, especially in America, that even a poor kid can become the president of the country. That anyone can work his way up to fame and fortune. But what happens when you have all the money you might need? People degenerate. Kane is the kind of character who degenerated. It is always about himself. He is the one who rules, he is the one who commands. He wanted a newspaper, so everyone could hear him...but no one could really know him. After the dies, the press asks itself what his last word might have meant. Rosebud. A reporter, named Thompson, is assigned to find out its significance...as if they could understand him after finding out that the sense of that one word.I believe it really does mean something he has lost. All his life, Kane suffered...without really knowing. All the ones around him, really were there to love him, because he needed someone to be able to go on. Like in Casablanca... His false idea was that he could get anyone with money and presents. He had to be in the center of all things. For him, he was all that really mattered.Kane was a disputed figure, someone who never quite knew what was right. Someone who thought that because he was rich, he could do anything he wanted with the ones around him. He kept his respect though for the whole American population, and he wished that they found out the truth about what was happening around them. You might say, he did accomplish his goal...but his methods, and his whole life, were messed up. His second way, poor miss Alexander, was forced to live a life she could not. A life without love, a life without real essence. She had the role to love Kane, without being loved. No friends, no nothing...all she liked were some jigsaw puzzles, and that was all she had to live with. Kane's friend, Jed, is just another person in his company...his friendship with Kane, is not of real essence, so it ends at a given point. Was it because the article? Or was it because he was drunk? I am not sure...maybe both. Maybe only the first. One more thing would be, that Kane always needs to do something with a reason...all he does, he does with a reason. How many people act so now? Can you act in such a way? Only with reason? Might be. But to always need to prove something, that is a thing that few people do. It shows how strong a man's will actually is. Kane is a figure which gets lost in this world. His needs are to high to be fulfilled. 'Citizen Kane' tries to make himself loved, through his abilities, through his humor, or through his way of thinking. Yet, he never gets to know the people around him...and thinks merely of himself. How can you write to people you do not really know? The thing that Kane never had, was a happy childhood and that's where man sets his limits. In this case, it all revolved around money.",9,0,2,11 January 2003
The Hunger Games," Evasive but engaging adaptation
","I suddenly found myself reading The Hunger Games trilogy in preparation for the movie, mainly due to the allure of Jennifer Lawrence. Thankfully, it was a pretty fun read, even though the books are fairly derivative, at least in regard to their dystopian theme. It's the ambivalence of Katniss that drives the story forward and keeps it interesting, so to my mind this was one of the most important things to get right in the movie.The universe of Panem, a land set in the future comprised of twelve districts and run by an authoritarian capitol, may seem a bit implausible in its literary portrayal, but the movie gets the tone and scope of the place just right. District Twelve is the home of our main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, a teenager charged with the responsibility of taking care of her mother and sister after the passing of her father in a mining accident. As if life weren't difficult enough on a day to day basis, every year the Capitol organizes 'The Hunger Games', a duel to the death in which two tributes, a boy and a girl, are enlisted from each district to battle for survival. The event is supposed to serve as a reminder and punishment of the failed rebellion against the capital which took place 74 years prior. In an unfortunate turn of the odds, Katniss is forced to volunteer for her younger sister once she is selected for participation in the games, and together with Peeta Mellark, the male tribute of District Twelve, she heads off into the unknown and, most likely, towards her demise.The key to understanding the event itself is that it represents a piece of entertainment, similar to the gladiator fights of Ancient Rome. As the participants are groomed for a televised show, the macabre concept behind the games may be easy to lose out of sight, and it is at this point that the direction of the film becomes a bit skewed and decides to evade/underplay one of the central plot lines in the book. In the transition from Katniss' literary narrative to the cinematic transposition, her struggle with herself and those around her, in particular Peeta, loses out. As the two tributes, under the guidance of their mentor, decide to play out a love story in order to endear themselves to the public, the film's focus shifts to the more easily translatable tension resulting from the potential love triangle between Peeta, Katniss and her childhood friend Gale (who remained in District Twelve), rather than focusing on the constant ambivalence in Katniss' soul. This is particularly interesting once it becomes evident that Peeta has truly been in love with her for many years, while the question of her own feelings towards him are shrouded behind the importance of self-preservation.Therefore, it is a shame that the film's choice is to portray the situation as a love triangle, set to develop further in the upcoming sequels, rather than to investigate the implication of how Katniss feels at odds with her situation and the role she has to play, knowing that in the end there is only one survivor to The Hunger Games. It is understandable that due to the scope of the movie franchise this would be a bit harder to sell, but it undermines one of the most fascinating themes of the book, the journey of Katniss' self-discovery.Implicitly, we get a fairly limited understanding of most characters and how they relate to one another. Despite this hindrance, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, who play Katniss and Peeta, manage to infuse a lot of what their characters are supposed to be into the final print of the movie, thereby conveying at least part of what is unwritten in the script and transpires from the books. Hopefully, the undertones of their relationship will be further expanded upon in the second movie, without focusing too much on the romantic dilemma, which serves as a backdrop in the books, rather than a driving force. Also, what the movie managed to do quite well is create a fine rapport between President Snow, played with delightful and menacing restraint by Donald Sutherland, and the game-maker Seneca Crane. Their scenes shed some insight into the workings of the games which otherwise could have needed a rather tiresome narrative, while still defining two characters of interesting depth.I can imagine some of the shortcomings mentioned are less evident to viewers who have not read the whole story, which leaves them with a pretty well rounded film about a cruel world that begs for many answers - but lacks a fair bit of heart. Seeing how difficult it is to rise up to the expectations of so many interested parties when producing a film like The Hunger Games, it is fair to say that the end result is a reasonably faithful and sensible adaptation of an engaging story. The politics behind Panem, which should feature more extensively in the second movie, will be a different challenge altogether, but the set-up for the sequel is solid and should offer a large enough scope to fulfill the vision of Suzanne Collins and her rather uncompromising characters.",7,1,6,31 March 2012
Finding Nemo," Somewhere beyond tranquility
","I haven't had so much fun since...'The Emperor's New Groove'! I know many people prefer Toy Story, or Ice Age,but I have a soft spot for the nice, funky lama. Now this movie left me totally excited, exactly as I was when I went to see it; just even better, of course. I've never seen so much humor combined so wonderfully with a smart plot and great animations, not even in Toy Story. After the little, and delightful if I may add, snow man, this movie melted all there was to melt in me. Sweet, adorable, funny, intelligent. These are the words which define 'Finding Nemo'.SpoilersThe story is about a father and his son, Marlin and Nemo. After Nemo is 'abducted' by humans, 'probably Americans', his father, frightened by the perilous ocean, leaves in an incredible quest to find his son. On his way he meets friends and enemies, who he encounters with his newly found buddy, Dory- an adorably cute blue fish, 'natural blue' as she affirms herself, but who most unfortunately suffers of short time memory loss. A brilliant touch for the humorous parts. Their journey is more than entertaining and exciting, with thrills and chills, laughter and tears, joys and sorrows. The end is never really important. It's important how you get there. That's what counts in life too.What I loved about this movie...is hard to express in one single sentence or phrase. Firs of all I loved the animations. Wonderfully constructed faces and gestures, which make your heart shrink to the size of a clown fish, or grow to the posture of a whale. I have never seen such incredible animations, which reflect perfectly the emotions of the characters. All great! The characters themselves are touching and smartly constructed and I find it impossible not to grow to like them. What they say is also very interesting and sometimes, beyond laughing, they might actually make you think. Unity, freedom, equality, are just some of the fundamental issues of man kind which are portrayed in this brilliant fable. I know, I tend to be boring by adding a superlative in each sentence, but it just makes me feel good! The voice acting is as well as it could be and the actors achieve to fill this movie with life. The absolute moment of brilliance, if I may say so, was Bruce. I think it was a great idea to let him remind us of a certain movie, you know which...yes, I mean 'The Shining'. So here's Brucey! Beyond the Sea, sung by Robbie Williams, at the end was just the cherry on top for me!It's just wonderful to spend an evening watching this movie, for all ages and all hearts. Well, almost all. I've read in some forums that people are wondering whether an animation movie can be nominated for Oscar. I personally doubt such a thing will happen, but I would certainly stand firmly behind this film. Watch it, is all I have to say. It's worth every breath! 9/10",9,0,1,6 December 2003
Blade," A little disappointing
","First of all, I want to say that I saw Blade 2 before seeing this one here, and I expected a little more, while regarding the rule 'Sequels are always(usually) worse'. Blade is kind of the same as Blade 2 in many aspects. I just enjoyed the guys in Blade 2 more...they looked incredibly ferocious.  This movie is a modern vampire story, with some nice elements but not really captivating action. Blade is the interesting one, as he is half/half. And then you can look at him out of two points of view: by a vampire, he is considered perfect; by his human part, he does not consider himself so.   The story of the movie is unspectacular, with some nice fight scenes, but that's kind of all. Not really much impresses, beside the good special effects. Not the actors, not the plot, nothing. This movie just doesn't seem fresh.   The only smarter part is the one about the conflict within the vampires. Pure blood, or not, does it really matter? Same question as in Harry Potter...just had to think of it. Here we see in a brutal way that it does not. But by this we neglect the fact that all pure blood vampires have more experience than the new ones, but still they are too few.
   This movie showed the vampires in a dark view. The only light is Blade. The vampires are everywhere...I would say that if it really is so, then why doesn't the world know anything about it...the vampires aren't perfect, and some of their victims might have escaped. Like the guy at the beginning...and I believe that there still is a vampire-free TV station...   Anyway, the movie is just shallow. Worth a 6.5 maybe...out of 10.",7,0,2,2 January 2003
The Others," Life of the Living Dead
","From time to time strange things happen to you. A strange desire, an urgent passion, or, who knows what else! One of the strangest and most macabre urges I've got is watching scary movies. Yes, you know it. That chill running down your spine, your heart pounding so loud the person next to you can hear it, eye lids closed, screams of terror, quickly followed by a shamefully amused giggle. That's the ride a good scary movie delivers for you. That's what 'The Others' keeps you through.It doesn't have a brilliant plot, the twists aren't 'dementially' cool as in The Sixth Sense, but it's got a feel of terror embroidered on its frames. Yes, it gets that horrific in the best of ways! A mother and her children live in a huge house, alone, until a some new servants pop up in front of their door and commit to their housekeeping tasks. But there's something wrong about the whole thing from the very beginning. The fog, the house, the children, the words...it's a feeling that takes hold of you and doesn't really let you go until near the end. It's authentic psychological horror, brilliant in all regards, not showing any truly obnoxious images. And I've never seen anything like it. Even 'The Sixth Sense' relies more on imagery and as I well recall, it wasn't all imagery there either. But - if I did start comparing it to The Sixth Sense - there's one more thing I need to add. There is a reasonable difference between the movies, especially regarding the emphasis. Shayamalan's movie relies on the ending and the ending is more than just the Cherry on top. Some will make the mistake to criticize 'The Others' for a sloppy conclusion, but this simply can not be regarded as the movie's strong point. It's the inner force that thrives through its intense tale. The movie itself forces you to admire it, not a simple gimmick.Nicole, I hate to admit it, is pretty damned good and the kids go just marvelous together. However, there will be those saying it's not 'that fresh' and not 'all that original'. Even if there is some truth behind those statements, it's still the best film of its genre in years...and years to come, probably. A definite must for fans and a scrupulous ride for those weak of heart. Great Amenabar!",8,1,2,14 February 2005
Resident Evil: Extinction," Same Old
","I had already ceased to hope that this movie franchise would have a lot to do with the Resident Evil games - of whom they conveniently 'borrowed' the name to get some easy cash from innocent fans. If you've seen the first two films, then really, there would be no reason for you to believe you'd go into the cinema and relive anything similar to the emotions the games can put you through. But ultimately, it's something else entirely that kills off this film and you can spot it with ease: it's recycled stuff.From Mad Max to Day of the Dead, The Birds, Land of the Dead and several other feature films, Resident Evil: Extinction 'borrows' extensively. I guess that's bad in itself, but if you consider that originality was the last thing which defined the film series, then it's actually got little to say.This third time around, Alice roams through the US with her nice super-powers in her attempt to ... (this is where you find out for yourselves what her purpose is, for the most I could figure out was 'seek revenge on Umbrella') in a world which has become completely barren and devoid of life. As a matter of fact, this little bit of info which is delivered to us in a short narration by Milla Jovovich at the beginning of the film - how the virus has somehow sucked the life out of our planet physically - is perhaps one of the most interesting concepts RE 3 has to offer, but unfortunately it's treated as such an insignificant matter that you are bound to ignore it all together. The actual storyline involves a bunch of people traveling through the desert without any real aim except for survival and the 'crazy doctor' who tries to find a cure and in the process is corrupted by power. There's a lot of fighting, kicking, slashing and shooting going on and it's all reasonably enjoyable, but the lack of purpose to the whole story makes you feel too detached to actually care for anything, even if Milla works quite hard to achieve the contrary. Some effects are cool, some scenes are a bit creepy, some elements actually look like those from the games. But seeing a central character like Albert Wesker introduced into the series as such a moronic persona, that was just appalling. I swear I'd have thought the guy playing Wesker was somehow related to someone related to the producers, because his acting is sooo poor, I just can't bring it into words. Not to mention the fact that the guy in the film bears no resemblance to the guy in the games, but for the name and the sunglasses - I guess in a way that actually makes him symbolic to the film franchise.I guess that if you can ignore him (or don't know the original to begin with) you'll be able to cope with the rest of the film better. It's ultimately a decent slash and dash flick, but the fact that in the end it leaves you with nothing whatsoever is just not enough as far as I'm concerned. To me, this stuff will never be Resident Evil.",4,1,2,13 October 2007
Silent Hill," Not so Silent Hill
","I played Silent Hill 2, a few years ago, although I never adhered to the big fans of the series. I'm more a Resident Evil kind of guy - staying in the characters and in the storyline, not so much in the psychological realms of 'what the heck does this mean?'. So, in a way, I'm envious, because the movie looks a lot like the games (although there seem to have been a lot of compromises in constructing it - characters from one game, storyline from another, etc; or so my big SH fan - informer tells me).However, Silent Hill suffers from a totally different disease than the Resident Evil franchise: the games are very engrossing, mind-boggling, they take you to the edge of perception and logic. A really hard thing to do in a film, without making it feel shallow and cold. Such an attempt would call for a great script. A script which, sadly, turns out to be so uninspired and poorly written, that it ruins all the fun.The story about a mother looking for her child - mysteriously drawn to the town of Silent Hill - is nothing but a long and tedious pretext for atmosphere. I hate to say it, but to make Silent Hill so 'worldly' as a story about witchcraft and silly monsters just isn't creepy enough. You do feel at times that the director tries to transfer ideas from the world of the games to the world of film, in the sense of Silent Hill being not only a typical 'ghost town' story, but also a metaphorical place of demise and sin, the most horrid depths of ones mind - a big, entrenching nightmare. But this barely works. In the end you're left with silly lines of dialog, mediocre acting at its best (not that one could have done much more with such lines) and - what I felt it to be - mundane lighting (in the idea of what scares you most is what you don't see; just that it doesn't quite work).I may have enjoyed the musical theme at certain moments, as it had a very dreamy ring to it - as it should've. But then again, it just wasn't enough. For a film which is two hours long, Silent Hill has very little contents to offer. It's not even the nightmare I always dreamt it to be.",5,4,5,17 August 2006
Alien," Horror
","Alien is a definitive experience. Just thinking back at the difficulties one had to face when approaching a genre which is nowadays filled with CGI, makes the feeling of admiration just surges within me. Despite the fact that we get the same main element, the alien, the stories change. This first movie, as usually the most important of the whole series, is certainly a milestone for all horror and sci-fi films.I would like to be able to tell the story from an objective point of view, but I consider it quite hard, as this type of movie, the horror type, is a disputed one. Each person can decide if it will or will not view such kind of movies. It is hardly probable that a person who does not like horror movies, will like this one. For one thing, horror movies will never win a major academy award, as they do not have what ALL people want to see. But if you want to be entertained, then this type of movie can get it on for you. Sci-Fi and Horror will always ring a scream in my head: Alien.SpoilersThe story is simple at the beginning...sometime in the future, a cargo ship detects a signal from a planet, and it awakes the crew to check on what it might be. Until the chosen ones get to the planet we get a strange, but scary atmosphere. The planet itself is most obviously against the presence of human life, as the conditions are unfavorable(this will not be the same in Aliens though...does humanity win? Or does that planet really represent the end of human life? We don't get to know that, but when something looks wrong...it usually is wrong). The alien ship stands like a great colossus between the rocks of the horrid planet, and once inside, the unknown attacks. One crew member is infected by what is called a 'face hugger'. A creature with acid instead of blood, with a great defensive system which spawns the worst nightmare of Ellen Ripley.There will be scenes which will make you jump and tremble, and the movie will keep you connected to the terrible events which happen on the Nostromo.Alien exploits the fear of the unknown at its best, from the darkness of space to the alien within poor Kane, from the intimacy of being lost in space to the fear of mega-corporations, to claustrophobia, to solitude, to betrayal. It's all here, all encapsulated in one of the greatest films ever made. And such a world would not be complete without the beast itself.All the things which relate to the evolution of the alien creature are brilliantly thought of. It has more phases of evolution, some phases in which it is truly vulnerable, yet it has the ability to survive, like any animal. Evolved instincts, great strength and a beastly intelligence...it could almost be something from our world. The fact that makes it different is the capacity to kill with ease humans - jolly! The most impressive thing about it is its looks: a fantastic design coming from the bizarre mind of Hans Rudi Giger, inspired - as a matter of fact - by his nightmares! Sigourney Weaver is the actress which will always be the symbol of 'Alien'. I guess it took you some time to guess that one right, didn't it? Well, as always, the story of getting a classic role is filled with near-misses and false impressions. But life has its way of making things right, in such a manner that it always leaves you thinking: it couldn't have been any other way. When it actually could have. Ridley Scott did a great job creating this universe with such a low budget, and he deserves most of the applause. He created one of the most terrific movies I have ever seen, with great horror scenes and great filming. His love for details made Alien what it is today - a huge mausoleum of horror, the wannabe result of any horror movie maker. Sinful in several ways by todays standards - slowly paced and lacking in terms of heavy action - Ridely Scott's film wins by defying them. A master at work can always be recognized.",9,1,2,18 January 2003
Capote," A Stand for Art
","What makes Capote stand out - especially - isn't anything else but one of the deepest conflicts of man, that between heart and mind. You may wonder 'why?', considering that the battles of heart and mind have been fought so often in the pragmatic world of art. The secret lies in the performance.P.S. Hoffman is more than astonishing. Capote isn't just a self indulging narcissist, or a heartless manipulator, or a brilliant writer, or the child forsaken by his mother. He is all these and much more and therefore stands for every man and woman that goes beyond himself or herself. The parallel between Capote and Perry, artist and murderer, is simply amazing and points out that we are a complex set of circumstances defined by moment and chance.Sacrificing oneself, one's passions, one's beliefs for art (or for any other equivalent notion)...by doing all this, Capote ruins himself. We are left contemplating the question, eternal and redundant: is it worth it? My guess, it may well be.",8,0,0,4 May 2006
Lost in Translation," It's a matter of people
","So it has been said, that this here production is the best of the year 2003. The only real adversary it had was Finding Nemo, not counting Mystic River and Kill Bill which I haven't seen. The ring guy was as predicted by me, and for me, just another movie in the series, which I consider purely...ok. Many things are at stake, once you dare to say that a movie is brilliant. Like the attitude which you, as an 'all-knowing' movie goer, will have to it, especially if your preferences and hopes lie on another movie. I loved Finding Nemo, but this is something different. SpoilersIt's a movie about the most strangest of places in the world, which has had a tremendous ascension in nowadays life as we know it: Japan. Never would I have imagined such a vertical place. The verticality is obviously exploited by director Coppola and amazing sights are assured. The story itself might be somewhat disappointing. I totally understand why. If you were to tell someone what happens in this movie, you would say: Well, it's these two people, who spend a while in an astonishing place...and they just talk and talk and then they leave. I think the film lacks an actual story and it is more of a portrayal of characters. As a logic consequence, the actors carry a heavy burden upon their shoulders. And they carry it surprisingly well. Billy Murray has always been a charming actor, ideal for the guy who takes life more as a big game. He's in a 'mid life crisis' and 'thinking' of buying a Porsche. The first meeting. Scarlett Johanssen certainly surprised me with her beauty, despite some 'misfeatures', and her natural talent. Both, Bob and Charlotte, as the characters are named, go through a rather disappointing period of life. They are actually very different people, but a beautiful friendship blossoms between them. You will learn more about them as the 'action' develops and will learn to love them. Their relationship never seems to go past a certain mark and it all seems so very simple. And simple means pure. Beautiful script and directing.You will be amazed by a certain beauty of life and through wonderful music, the movie will conquer you if you are prepared to let yourself conquered. It's not the average movie you see every day, actually it is a great movie. It has higher aims than just the sentimental bond between Bob and Charlotte, as it asks essential questions about life, marriage and pleasure. Well, life includes all...There are many beautiful things to see and so I recommend you see them. Better sooner than later and better later than never. 9/10",9,0,0,12 January 2004
Gone Baby Gone," Ethical Concerns
","To begin with, I want to say that this is not really a review of the film. As such, it is one of the better achievements of the year, as it tells a story of ambivalence and context, about a kidnapped girl and the search for a better life. It is however the ethical standpoints of the characters which aroused my sense of 'being there' and which ultimately raised the film over the bar of mediocre good films. The question is as follows: should Patrick give in to common sense morality and not notify the police that ex-copper Jack Doyle has set up a complex ploy so to kidnap a girl from her drug abusing mother in order to offer the former a better life?'Yes' is the answer which a world governed by laws would deem correct (not necessarily moral). 'Yes' is, ultimately, the safer choice. I say this, because abiding by rules is in itself always safer than not doing so, moral dilemmas notwithstanding. But Patrick, as hinted throughout the film, does not take decisions based on their level of complexity, on their consequences, but on his rigid moral code (=trust in the legal system), which makes him a perfect element of the legal system. Many films have asked this question, of how moral police duty has to be and to which lengths an officer should go in order to convict a person he obviously deems guilty, but lacks proof to substantiate such a claim. Legally, it is wrong for policemen to facilitate justice in such a manner, even if the outcome is a positive one. But once again, this does not mean that the act itself is not moral, because there is no ultimate decider which has deemed the legal system infallible - the fact that it is man conceived states the opposite. The legal system is a system, in the sense that we require systems in order to function as a social entity. If there was no system, most of our concepts about the world we live in would be void of meaning. Ergo, we need systems to survive in a community, the question being whether and how systems should be changed and if undermining the system is fundamentally wrong. Now, the system is important because usually, certainty is not as easily attainable as it comes in a film in which we are omniscient. Which brings us to the aforementioned issue - is undermining the system something fundamentally wrong? If we are dealing with a system that nurtures our freedom (as is the case here), then we can safely assume that it is a system we need (totalitarian systems, for example, we don't really need). So should this system break down because our act of undermining it, then we have done severe harm to everyone involved. But if it doesn't, then the act could theoretically be considered.Patrick's choice is certainly not a consequentialist one. It is obvious that the child's mother is far from fit to nurture her, as the mother's own destructive lifestyle shows. Even the hope of redemption on her behalf is more or less squashed in the ending. Still, this does not mean that Patrick has made the wrong choice. He has however made a more difficult choice, from all perspectives: he lost his girlfriend over it, he threw away what probably was a better environment for the child, and he was left deeply concerned about the situation. It's true that he'd have been concerned any way, but given his decision to ensure the kid's return to her mother, Patrick became obliged to guarantee that his sense of morality did not ruin a small girl's life. Therefore, my interpretation is that his act can only be deemed as correct, if he can himself compensate for the mother's inability to take care of the child. There is one more issue to discuss: does a mother have fundamental moral right to have her child? The answer to this is simple, as there can't be any fundamental intrinsic moral rights in a world of reason as far as anything not relating to the self is concerned. This means that a mother has a legal right to be with her child, but she can't have any God given right to it, just because she was the one to bear it onto this world. There is no moral worth to getting pregnant and then giving birth to a child. It is the manner in which you take care of it that entails moral value. So as far as I can tell, the film does not sentence Patrick's judgment. Even in philosophical terms, a utilitarian couldn't deem his choice as good or bad, because its consequences are still uncertain. Somehow though it feels wrong to think of morality as something retrospective, that means as something which can only be judged as time goes by. I say this because I can't see how anyone could truly foresee what consequences his actions will have when he takes them. Sure, one could assume, but would a wrong assumption then mean that the person to have taken it is a bad person? No. The decision itself might be bad, so in this sense, morality can be retrospective, but in the end, it is the individual people we want to know something about, not their choices. I do enjoy films which put my mind to work. I'm not saying 'mindless fun' doesn't serve its purpose - and sometimes even when you get wound up by a movie (Deja Vu), this doesn't necessarily mean it is good. Gone Baby Gone is a good film though, with good all around performances. And it also gives you something to think about.",8,1,3,24 December 2007
Predator," Another alien
","There are these films between which I always seem to feel a connection. I mean Alien and Predator... First was the alien. Then was the predator. And I guess we'll soon see the alien versus the predator. I have to laugh when I think of a movie with the aliens hissing and the predators growling at one another.
Predator is a good action movie. That is a fact which can hardly be negated. You could then ask how far this 'greatness' goes. I'll want to write that as a conclusion at the end. The predator is quite an interesting creature. Ferocious, strong and smart...but the smartness of the predator is not to be compared with the smartness of the aliens. They are much more amazing. What impressed me most was how the predator looked: so real...I must say it was one of the best scenes in the movie. SPOILERThe story is quite superficial, but the action covers the gaps of the story. One of the great scenes, from my point of view, is the scene where they start shooting after the predator...and they shoot down a huge part of the jungle. It looks mad! Probably is. Which I consider though the best scene...the end battle I would say. The situation changes then. The hunter does actually become the hunted. Schwarzenegger versus the mighty beast. We get to see fighting techniques and tactics, which by themselves can steal the show away.At first, the whole fight is a huge unknown for the humans. But as the action develops, the humans learn its qualities, but also its weak points. With these Schwarzenegger actually defeats the monster which is much stronger than him. With brains, not only with brute force. Very good...something different.It's not worth talking about the actors or anything, as I personally don't put much importance on acting in an action movie. I guess I could try to compare it to 'Aliens'. The difference between the two movies remains though as huge as the distance from earth to the moon. 'Aliens' is action, but with plot and with horror. The actors go along smoothly and the movie lets you enjoy real action and shooting. 'Predator' though, doesn't succeed in as many ways as 'Aliens' did. It's only action, not as interesting as in the other movie, and it's in no way fear. I'd say Predator is what results out of the mixture of 'Alien' and 'Aliens'. Only one creature(same as Alien), a lot of action though to kill it(Aliens) and knowledge remains more important than human life(Alien/Aliens).I'd say it's worth to see the movie. It's a good way to relax. As a mark, I'd say 7,5 maybe 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,6 February 2003
The Aviator," The Great American
","Needless to say, with Martin Scorsese scribbling his name on this picture it's granted automatically a statute of epic proportions. However I have this feeling Scorsese has taken a wrong turn, a few years ago. I didn't really like 'Gangs of New York', but 'The Aviator' exceeded my worst expectations. Yeah, it's that bad.There are a few undebatable points of critique. The first is the movie's length. There doesn't exist any cohesion between the material and the time it takes to present it, so, at some point, it all falls apart. And the reason for this implosion is that there is practically next to not tension in the movie. It's got no grip.The second is Howard Hughes' persona in the film. Now, I don't know why, but I'd call it the Kane syndrome, people keep falling for demented creeps who appear to have a vision. It is not groundbreaking that people aren't perfect and it's not that exhilarating, nor dramatic to see a stuttering man getting stuck at this one phrase, repeating it over and over again. It does not penetrate, it blinds in. And the absolute down point of the film is, paradoxically, the only real scene where it shows some guts, at Hughes's hearing. Why? Because the things he says are so stupid. Don't interpret stupid as dumb. Consider it out of context and false, trying to dramatically impose a figure upon the viewer.The third reason, and let's say last because three is a magic number, is Scorsese's total lack of inspiration. He is uninspired by insisting to keep Di Caprio as his lead, when Di Caprio can simply not captivate due to the Titanic syndrome. He is uninspired in his choice of 'lirysm', because at some points the visuals don't match the music. Shortly put, he's bland.It wouldn't be fair to omit the few intelligent moments of screen writing - rare, but nonetheless delightful given the monotony of this whole thing. Maybe Blanchett who actually seems to be an actor can gain some appraisal from me, but not much. I don't really enjoy her. That's it.'The Aviator' is like the Hercule of Hughes' in some regards. It's just too damn big and ripped off to fly.",5,5,10,26 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," No way!
","The best movie of all time...13 nominations...still crap.Why? Because of the horrible actors,and the horrible....how can I call it...DURATION! This movie is the best movie of all time, only if The Sixth Sense is a comedy! As a normal citizen, I had to be 'very smart' to get my tickets a few hours early, because the cinema was almost FULL! Well,that isn't weird considering of what people have been saying...'Best movie I ever saw!!!' Luckily, I didn't await to be surprised by the movie, meaning I didn't await for it to be excellent...maybe good! And that was very smart again, because the movie would've been a disappointment otherwise. LOTR was more of a parody, than of a serious movie! The great ideas of the book must've got lost, because the idea of friendship, and the idea that evil lies in the smallest things weren't the ones considered most important in the movie. Smallest things.....money! They always take control of you...so did the ring.I do NOT doubt that the book wasn't good, and that the movie didn't have good intentions, BUT the movie was not of good quality. First of all it took too long...I almost fell asleep at some scenes.The actors were rather pathetic...but I must say, that stupidity is always nice to laugh at, as long as you aren't the stupid one!-The 'nice' scenes where they all fought with hundreds of goblins,or what they were,and they defeated them! That was incredible...fun! And then, when our 'friend',stuffed up with arrows, fought as if he'd just came out of the shower, was hilarious! And the 'sweet' beheading! The movie surely didn't rise to the standards imposed by 'A Beautiful Mind', and wasn't worthy of many Oscars. And I was delighted when I saw that it didn't win at the important categories...finally, some smart decisions. I don't want to be misunderstood...this movie wasn't that terrible...I surely went too far with the negative things, because so many said it was the best of all time...no. This movie was a mediocre movie, with a mediocre cast. What was worth hearing...I guess you know what I want to say...the soundtrack...Also, the visual effects were splendid! But, how should I put this: sound and effects just don't add up in the best movie of all times...not even in a good movie. Well...a mark...5 or 6/10. Sorry for all the people I insulted, but I just can't understand what people saw in this movie...sorry...I'm probably the stupid one here. Right?",6,0,1,2 November 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," My Tricks
","Welcome, welcome, please step inside! It's the big Matrix night! Rumor has it, it's going to be a revolution this time. Even more! Come, come, don't fear anything, because there is nothing to fear. There is nobody here: look, the whole cinema is empty. It will only be you, me and the Matrix. Everything else, well those will be my tricks. Minor SpoilersI've come this far and I've seen the Matrix trilogy. I really doubt it was ever supposed to be one. It would've been better if it hadn't. But, as it is, we have to play along, pay our tickets and hope things won't be as they always are. Still we can choose and the choices we make can change the outcome of the action. That means we can choose not to go, we can choose not to indulge this kind of attitude towards us and towards art. You can do that, you still have the chance. I've wasted mine. It's sad to see how things have turned out. What once was an impressive Sci-Fi movie, even more, has become a lame drama pumped up with action to fill in the gaps of loneliness: I mean those silences when Neo looks at Trinity and they proclaim their everlasting love. The Matrix wasn't about that and it's not what the people, the audience, wanted to see. I therefore expect a negative outcome of this affair. Fairly predictable, lacking any real innovations up to the end, which surprisingly does save a small fish. Too bad it isn't enough to save the species. And if you are wondering, yes there still is room for another. As the producers have run short of smart talk, they just thought using some 'reloaded' lines would do just as well. Guess what: it didn't. Expect to get bored, but don't leave the cinema before it stops, because then you will say your final(?) journey into the Matrix was a real waste.So in case you do fight through until the end, then you can expect some big 'booms!' and 'bams!', even some intelligent talk. Or is it just smart? Anyway, you will also so what has become of the once fearsome agent Smith. Actually he's become a farce, a lame excuse for an ending. And I don't know why, but I don't think it's good. What's even worse is that a mad thought went through my head: he's the best thing of this film.I agree with those who will say it's entertaining towards the end, because it is.But there's a difference between entertaining and good. These two terms don't quite coincide. Neo, what have you saved? Maybe the world, for the moment, maybe your Matrix, but not ours. It's not right, why should we suffer while you live? 6.5/10",6,0,0,7 November 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Going for the decathlon?
","I've watched this movie while enduring a terrible headache. Not that I'd want you to jump to any conclusions; it wasn't because of Schwarzenegger. It was because I had seen the sequel to Charlie's Angels(though I haven't seen the original). I might comment on that another time, but just so you know: it's bad.I guess The Terminator is one of this years 'hits', at least regarding the popularity. Too bad you can't see it now in California, as Arnold is doing his new act. I feared much before this movie, but I can say my fears have been allayed. It wasn't as bad as it could've been; actually it was rather good. SPOILERSSome might have noticed this(or maybe not): I tend to put that 'spoilers' thingy every time and I don't tell when they end. My way of reviewing actually involves few spoilers, but sometimes, for the film's sake, I just have to put some in...and I definitely don't want any trouble with 'the big guys' from wonderful imdb. First of all I am impressed by how Arnie has kept in shape! Seriously now, he really does still look like the Terminator we all knew. He cam, he saw, he terminated; that's how I'd call his part. I like Arnold, always have, and I certainly like him more than Stallone or Van Damme. He's just more interesting to watch. All talk very little, but Schwarzenegger did sometimes defy this 'custom'. He is the symbol of the movies and always will be, though the true center should actually be lain, story wise, on the future leader of the human race: John Connor. Nick Stahl does a good job to look like a desperate man, certainly not at as a leader, but he starts being what he will be towards the end. I liked the idea that the woman is always behind the man: quite was here. Nice Clare Danes, too. Miss Kristanna 'TX' Loken was, of course, the 'big newcomer'. I can't say that I liked her more than the previous terminator. Actually, I liked her less. But if that's what we got, we have to live with her, and I certainly would. The story is somewhat more complex than I expected and the ending really did take me quite off guard. It was certainly the best way the film could've ended so that it would've been good. A 'human win all' scenario would've been more disappointing. Story wise it is good. What the main problem is? Somewhat expected I believe: similar scenes involving the terminators with the previous movies. The action was very enjoyable, a lot of cars blown up, a lot of people gunned down, stuff like that, but all in all enjoyable. Good direction I'd say, better than expected. Might have been something else with Cameron, but...this was destiny! Almost reminded me of The Matrix towards the end.
Just go and see it. It's a nice flick. If you liked the first two, I don't really see why you shouldn't like this one. A healthy 8/10. Oh, I almost forgot. Did you wonder about the title? Well, if you'll see the movie you might just get your answer.",7,0,0,29 August 2003
The Shining," Care to Shine?
","I'm not sure whether I've come to admire Kubrick or not, but, in a bizarre way, I think you can't help but stand still and stare, while in awe, at a man of his artistic discipline and rigorous vision. Brilliant films such as the Clockwork Orange or Dr. Strangelove are undoubtedly tremendous achievements, Lolita remains an interesting experience, Full Metal Jacket put me in a strange mood, something between amusement and deep reflection (oh, well, maybe not so deep), Barry Lindon was just too awkward and long, despite showing off with some great costumes and art design, but The Shining...where can I put that? After having read the story, I wouldn't really say that the book version was better, yet I don't have the conviction to affirm that the film is either. OK, so what it's about: a couple (the Torrance's) with one child travel to this lonesome, yet luxurious hotel somewhere in the mountains and get a job as caretakers, thus having to inhabit the hotel only by themselves for the winter period. All alone, desperate to put together a play, Jack Torrance takes a slip towards insanity...and it seems that being locked away with the same bunch of people over a long time frame can have quite devastating effects on the psyche.SPOILER I will just ask one question, which remains without answer from my perspective: why let Hallorren die after all that effort? It just doesn't fall into place and keeps me thoroughly unsatisfied. I wouldn't try to argue saying Stephen King's version of it was better, because it was too 'soft and predictable', still Kubrick's choice leaves me puzzled.END OF SPOILERThe film is truly entangled in its own weary life, wavering between its characters, delightfully portraying Jack Torrance's desperation. Nicholson is simply brilliant in doing it. On the other hand, Shelley Duvall is just a mess...she's so bad, I'd have normally expected her to ruin the whole movie. But this is the funny part: she didn't. Kubrick maintains some balance within the story and between the characters, although the ending kind of leaves me staring in a blur, due to it being somewhat meaningless, even absurd. It simply doesn't convey an acceptable solution, that's my issue.On the whole, however, 'The Shining' is definitely worthwhile, although not as impressive as Kubrick's other works. If you have any doubts whether watching the movie is productive or not, just imagine Jack Nicholson at his best. It's not the mysterious and terrifying King here, it's the pragmatic and analytical Kubrick.",8,0,0,29 October 2002
The Machinist," The Good and The Bad
","I've decided that the film is somehow disrupted by the two major 'forces' which created it: the director and the script. And here is a summary of the ups and downs.The Good It's only fair to begin with this, given that it is also the most obvious bit for the innocent viewer. Brad Anderson is simply awe inspiring in this totally atmospheric joint, so dense and sinister you can feel it grow on you. From colors to angles, they all form this self sustaining being which pulsates constantly with death - because this is what the movie is about, no beating about the bush here. Furthermore, Christian Bale - who so resembles Ethan Hawke in this slim version - is just as much of a decisive factor as Brad's directing, simply because he is so absorbed by his character that he displays an utterly convincing performance.The Bad However, no matter how dense or tense of an atmosphere you've got, when the viewer (like myself) can't stop thinking of another movie (Fight Club) while watching this one...it's bad. I just kept on watching and expected something to happen, something that might've elevated the thing, something that would've given it some actual meaning, something beyond the macabre curtains of the world. But no, it feels so streamlined that it brings too little of an original story to actually be appreciated on the whole. It's all well tied up, but totally by the book.After putting it in perspective, the conclusions seem obvious to me: meager concept, marvelous achievement in making it be. Whether to watch it? Yes, I suppose so, but generally some patience is advised for, especially given the conditions (images so penetrating, that I could actually feel their terrible stench...such misery).",7,1,1,20 April 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Care for tea?
","As a Potter fan, the world is a rather sad place to be hanging around. It's a matter of principle, no more, no less. The refuge one may find in the books is comforting in an enchanting way, but can the films be so as well? After watching HP's one and two, nay was all that I could say. Both films were somewhat played down in quite a few regards and despite differing only in details from the books, they both achieved the tremendous performance of boring me to a paralysis-like state. Surely enough, there were things I liked, but reality and fantasy remained two separate things: you can't get a Harry Potter without taking him from the muggle world and the muggle world simply needs time to learn and to grow up. And they did, all of them, those little brats, all for Harry's sake and under Cuaron's guidance! What makes HP 3 a much more enjoyable ride is the sense of existence with which the characters are finally bestowed. They are leading a life of their own and the kids finally learned how to show that on screen - obviously, with Cuaron's help, who was more than able to reinvent Rowling's universe in a way only a true visionary could've done. Columbus wasn't up to the task, for all that mattered in his case was the frame and not the painting itself! It's very important to be able to guide children and the only real way to do it is by making it feel natural. So Cuaron did.The third book is probably the best one to film due to the plot, mainly. That's one of the reasons why it plays out so well as a movie. But the fact that the kids have started to grasp the basic concepts of acting and the stunning visuals create a new world for us to taste have had an undeniable positive influence upon the end result. This new film is good because it finally shares the spirit of the book: the innocent hope, the complicated issues of life (and death), the reasons which make us tick the way we do. It's a step in discovering who the heck you really are, who the heck Harry is and what he is becoming. The 'wise words of Dumbledore' are always powerful and mysterious, in the sense they really should be. And it's good this way, because there so much more behind them and we want to want to be intrigued. That's what Cuaron managed to do, he created a world which leaves enough unanswered questions as there can be. Finally someone who understands the essence of the book. Finally something fresh and exciting. That's the way HP is supposed to be!",8,4,6,25 July 2005
American History X," Nearing perfection...
","American History X is one of the saddest, one of the most moral and definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Everything, from the subject of the movie, to the actors is nearing perfection(as we know: nothing's and no one's perfect beside God). The actual fact, that the movie's theme is as real as it can get is a strong point. These are things which probably are still happening everywhere. It doesn't matter if it's black, yellow or red. It happens everywhere.    Unfortunately, the brilliance of this movie seems to not have been understood or accepted by some people, and I'm thinking especially about the people who award the well known Academy Awards. But, let's be serious: does a movie have to be recognized by a hand of people to be good?    From the beginning to the end of the movie you shall feel the intensity of the things that are happening. You shall tremble, and you shall fear. You shall think and you shall see, that maybe you know these things. Or, maybe not. It's a thrilling walk, through our present world. It's something you might not understand. It's something you might not accept. It's that fact that some people do think the way it's presented in the movie. Maybe one of those is reading this. I'm sure that those people will say the movie sucked. And maybe it did for them. You can choose to either be as blind as¬Ö.or to be as open minded as  Derek. It's your choice. And whatever you will do, you will have to say it before God. Of course, for these people the only problem is: God does not exist. As proven, it's not a lost cause, and you can always turn around. There's one point of view out of which I fear this movie probably failed. If it's only purpose was to entertain, then it's merits are sky high. But, if it had the objective to change the way some people are thinking, I doubt it succeeded. That's what I believe. Sadly, the movie only repeats the things most of the people know. It can be less impressive for some, out of a simple reason: It shows you reality, a reality in which you live in, but a reality which you already know. Or think you know. The fact that at the end Danny dies, killed by a black kid will leave a big question open: what will Derek do? What will he do now, after his second relative is killed by a black person¬Öhe might turn back to his old ways¬Öit remains an open question, and the answer will depend on each persons character. I myself, believe that he shall not stray on the wrong path again. Despite that fact that all you learn, can be unlearned, I think that after the lesson he got in prison, he will not waste his life without doing anything good for him, his family, or any other person.    Now to the cinematic part. I think Edward Norton was simply amazing! He fit so well in his role and he acted so flawlessly that he would have deserved a tiny, tiny bit of the Oscar. Of course, Roberto Benigni's acting was as good as Norton's, and it's very hard for me to choose a winner. I would go though on Benigni, because I have a good feeling when American awards are handed over to non English speaking people. I mean people who don't have English as their native language of course.      Norton though is one of the actors which will have( if you don't want to say he already has) a shining career as an actor.        Edward Furlong showed some impressive skills, and surely deserves to be called a great hope of modern cinematography.        I would like to end the review here, because there isn't much more to say to it. This movie should be seen without hesitation by everyone, because it can be a lesson. And I ask, can a movie be brilliant if it doesn't effect the viewers' lives?    Rating? 9.5/10",9,0,0,29 November 2002
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A Matter of Experience
","I reckon this has to be a polarizing film, seeing how Wright chooses to make sure there is very little middle ground to tread on. But, hey, I love polarizing films as long as I'm on the right side of polarization.Rarely have I enjoyed a film experience so much as I enjoyed this one, thanks mainly to the excellent blend of fantasy, adventure and...realism. It covers the essential basis of tangency and then takes you through a fantastic journey of self-discovery and bemused romance. Particularly if you're transitioning from teenage-hood to adulthood, when the 'real world' starts catching up with you really fast, this is something that allows you to take your mind off things, to find refuge in a faithfully familiar place.The story of Scott Pilgrim, our oh-so-subtly named protagonist (like so many other characters, actually), describes a fairly restless and isolated guy, who happens to fall in love with the girl of his dreams. Literally, as she turns out to be very much alive and kicking. Yet, everything about her is dreamlike, from the snow melting under her roller blades to her eccentric way of being and becoming. As with every fantasy world, there are a few obstacles involved in conquering the fair lady, in this case manifested through the presence of seven evil exes that need to be defeated. So Scott has to get through this series of challenges in arcade style match-ups, as if it were that simple to get what you've always dreamed of. Can't say though that the thought never crossed my mind.The film's comic sense is sometimes ridiculous, but it always seemed fulfilling. Regarding the actors, Michael Cera is enjoyable, even though I'd say Kieran Culkin was the more delightful actor to watch - or Ellen Wong, who portrayed her character in a virtuous Japanese anime style. Clearly however, a dreamlike central figure like Mary Elizabeth Winstead was essential to the well-being of Scott Pilgrim and I reckon she was an excellent choice, even without needing to do too much to affirm herself.Ultimately the film captures the spirit it is trying to convey so very well, that spirit of a naive and noisy youth, filled with cultural and pseudo-cultural pillars of reference. If you can resonate with this (as I assume anyone who still has some vague memory of teenage years can), with all that is implied by the bizarre and childish world it creates, then this has to be an experience worth trying out.",9,1,9,3 November 2010
Resident Evil," Guts and...
","Over one year passed since I first heard that the movie was being made and I've been waiting for it since then. Time passed once again after it was premiered, but I still didn't get to see it...until this oh-so happy day. And what do I have to say? 'twas a satisfactory experience. Terror of the undead is a pretty usual theme for horror movies. You've got Romero's groundbreaking Night, Day and Yawn...sorry, I meant Dawn. This, though, is the first horror movie that started from a game, the popular Resident Evil series. It seems to be a profitable deal to 'inspire' yourself from games, but there is this other thing too. What do Tomb Raider, Final Fantasy and Resident Evil actually point out? The same that a number after a movie does: lack of imagination. A bit more 'obsessive' in the gaming world, but still very present in the cinematic affair as well. I am not against these 'inspired' movies. As long as they're good, that is. Resident Evil, directed by Paul Anderson, nearly throws up the following storyline: In a top-secret underground facility a deadly (and terribly contaminating) virus is set free. The computer (Red Queen) closes all exists to the outside world, and all the employees (who till recently had worked for the Umbrella Corporation) are killed. But, actually, as you may imagine, they are not quite...dead.Umbrella sends a special agents team to clear up the mess, and set things as straight as possible. This team will actually be shattered in the underground laboratory by what they find there. The stench of death everywhere. Milla Jovovich is the leading actress in the movie - solid reason for avid movie goers to see this one- and she plays the role of a security agent, who works for Umbrella. Incidentally, she suffers a memory loss after she inhales a protection gas released by the Red Queen. We get to find out in the movie who she really is and what she was going to do.Michelle Rodriguez, Mr. Purefoy & company all get together to do their acting tricks and they do them as well as they could've given the film. Now, as all fans of the RE series will say, this film totally sucked. I nearly subscribe. Only 'nearly' because it wasn't the excremental waste the second movie is (I was so naive in thinking it couldn't get any worse). Also, had there not been some very sloppy distribution of zombie actors and had Anderson at least been careful enough to do the simple things right, technically and chronologically speaking, then RE could've stood a chance. All Anderson does is fit in some cool moves, some cool zombie dogs, while leaving the rest of the film to rot. I consider his attitude extremely disgusting: why make a movie called Resident Evil if you don't want it to have anything to do with the game? (yeah, I know, money...it's meant to be rhetorical) It's as simple as this: the film doesn't do justice to the games. So even if RE can be a reasonably satisfactory sit-through, I am absolutely against what Anderson has done to the franchise, which simply wasn't his to ruin.",4,0,0,22 October 2002
Alien vs. Predator," Serious vs Groovy
","I suppose it's hard to make a serious movie about aliens and predators. But what you sure can do is a movie that looks groovy and feels good to the eye. It's not even that hard, given that since the last Alien/Predator films, which looked and felt good, technology has advanced at an absorbing rhythm. In a way, that's also the problem: you have to know how and when to use special effects. If you don't, you risk a big flop. Is AvP a flop? Sadly, yes. Its rather eye-brow raising story and character 'development', as well as the terribly distant cinematic experience just add up to an unsatisfying product. It's not bad for a Friday night, but if that's your standard, then there's nothing anyone can do about it. Anderson is incurable. I wouldn't say he's a big idiot, because it'd be a bit harsh. He did kind of ruin/diminish some interesting franchises (Resident Evil and this here), but I'm sure he was all well intentioned. Maybe things would've worked out different if he hadn't written the script, but it's a mystery to me why people keep on laying this terribly heavy burden upon his shoulders.AvP is another recycled flick, as are all of Anderson's 'creations'. A bit of this, a bit of that, even a reasonably big bit of Resident Evil techniques and: voila! Here's your blockbuster. I don't know how to describe this feeling inside. Maybe the actual lack of it is enough of a fact. Also, I don't understand why people keep saying 'it feels like a video game' to all the recent adaptations of games for the big screen. None of the films actually feel as a video game, because while playing a VG you immerse into an extravagant universe and become obsessively accustomed with it. This just doesn't happen with the films. Oh, so you mean games are nearly stupid and rather simplistic, not material enough for the brain-chewing audience? Well, if a film could achieve half of the atmosphere, tension and involvement a good game does, then it'd be a terrific experience.I wonder whether AvP is based on the games...or whether it is a face off between the two films. It's difficult to make a connection based on the film and that does say something. Anderson has to stop writing screenplays the way I have to stop singing during breaks at school. And I HAVE to stop singing during breaks at school. 5.5/10",4,0,0,26 November 2004
28 Days Later...," A Pint of Rage
","As it so happens, 28 Days Later is the best zombie movie in the last few decades. Probably since Romero's classics, if I recall accurately. It stands up on its own in a genre which is frequently plagued by a sort of innate stupidity, a consequence of one too many dead people. Otherwise how could one explain the fact that the most acclaimed zombie films are parodies of the genre? 28 Days Later shares a striking resemblance with Resident Evil, in that it kind of starts where RE left off: after one of the most exciting intro sequences I have ever witnessed (!), a lonely average-Joe, (Jim in this particular case) wakes up in a deserted London and takes a jolly good walk through the intimidatingly empty streets. Man-kind seems to have been wiped out by a contagious virus which induces a sort of blind rage upon those who fall prey to it. As may have guessed by now, this will be a story of survival.While most horror films will offer a relatively exciting ride with little more than sparse scares, Danny Boyle's movie sheds a new light on the survival instinct of human beings which can damned well spook the living hell out of you - even if not in the traditional sense. Looking at Children of Men might offer some insight into what it feels like to have no future and this itself may clear the way to appreciating 28 Days Later.I guess it's one of those rare horror films which not only enlighten the viewer with nice, gory slaughters but also with a share of psychological goodies. 28 Days Later doesn't forget 'the Master' either and offers an obvious and unobtrusive tribute to Dawn of the Dead. All around the movie keeps you going because it is an immersive experience and not just a 'poke-your-finger' kind of experience.",8,101,141,12 September 2003
The Lives of Others," The Story With No Words
","It's the second time I've watched Das Leben der Anderen this year. That my initial viewing was less satisfying than the second, is the first thing I have to report. I've thought about the reason why and I believe to have stumbled upon one: with all the facts in, I could look more closely at the story of the man behind the story. A story of no words.My first impression of this tale about the good old German STASI and its ways was that it might be a bit too optimistic. I bet my grandfather, who at his own time has been through the mystique of communist interrogations, would agree and deem it a propagandistic fairytale. As far as I'm concerned, now that I've come to terms with the aforementioned reality, I suppose I can accept that people such as HGW might well have existed and might just as well have been overlooked by this new, gracious system which engulfed the former 'democratic republics' of the time. The world is full of people who undertake less obvious leaps for man and small steps for mankind.I'd still rather have had Guillermo Del Toro's Labyrinth win the Oscar for Best Foreign Film, but it's surely not unusual for the deciding factors to prefer a deep story of human redemption to an actual R-rated fairy-tale. Fact of the matter is, both these films (Labyrinth and Life of Others) were films of totally superior class to the productions nominated for Best Picture at the same awards, which only comes to show (once more) how hollow prizes can be.So why should you watch this amazing debut film, you might ask. Well, it's firstly because it's a modern day, more personal and more subtle Schindler-story and secondly because it offers some insight into an atrocious system, one that is often underrated as far as its inhumanity goes. Also, Sebastian Koch and the late Ulrich Muhe portray their characters in a most immersive manner, highlighting one very important fact: it's human nature that both sustained and eroded the communist system in its extreme form.",9,0,2,4 September 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Quite an improvement
","Actually it was as I expected. I had heard that there would be more action in this movie, so I did believe, that if all was done well, I would enjoy it. If I look at both movies, I notice that there isn't much of a change in the actual movies, but in the action. The Fellowship of the Ring didn't achieve to amaze me. It was poorly made, without any real action, without any real feelings and without any real characters. All that was interesting was the ring, but the ring can't keep on its own the whole movie. Special effects...well, I consider they are quite enchanting, but not as enchanting as they should have been. I'll get back to these a little bit later.
SPOILERSThe Two Towers is the long awaited sequel to the widely praised Fellowship of the Ring. If you read my review to that movie, which is a little bit harsh, then you will know that I did not appreciate the first movie. What makes me like this movie is the action. nothing else. I personally consider it an action movie, with a little bit of adventure. The amazing battles make up for the quite pathetic sentimental scenes. The scenes that ruined the first movie. The actors are incapable to get real feelings into the movie, so I remained kind of cold to all the dead after which they 'weeped'.
The characters do not change...except Gandalf. I did not totally understand the change that took place in him, but I guess that is because I haven't read the books. Still, this is a minus point. What really makes me laugh...well, this is regarding to the best movies of the year poll. Not the fact that LoTR is at the top. That was what I expected. What I find hilarious is that Liv Tyler actually has a place in th category of supporting actresses. She barely appeared 15 minutes during the whole movie, but still she's there. This is just one of the things which prove to me how superficial such polls are. Not to mention how LoTR appears at sections such as 'Best Documentary'... There is this interesting creature Gollum. Gollum who is the result of what the ring can make of something living. Smeagol is what actually remains of the former self. Smeagol is weak though, and Gollum doesn't have much of a fight to take control. This is how I saw things. There were some who said that Gollum was for LoTR as Dobby was for Harry Potter. I will not deny there aren't any similarities, but I do not think they should be compared. Gollum has a much more important role in LoTR, while Dobby barely appears for some minutes in HP and the Chamber of Secrets. I believe this is a difference which matters. Beside that, the characters definitely aren't the same 'inside'.I am quite curious which part of the creature will win: Gollum or Smeagol.The story itself is about war...and despite what some might be trying to do, I do not think it is really about the losses that a war brings. King Theodon is the one who says he regrets the losses, but I can barely FEEL him saying it. The battles are quite impressive...The special effects now...well, regarding the battle scenes they are very well done. But then, I didn't feel quite at peace while seeing Pippin and Merry on that big tree. They seemed not to belong to that picture. Probably is the result of unsuccessful effects. That's what I believe... The scene which I liked most was when the dam was destroyed and the water destroyed all that came in its way(except the living trees). It was a beautiful scene...as was the scene of the attack of Gandalf and his reinforcements. Unfortunately that was predictable, and it was a kind of traditional opposition.(light-dark)I guess this movie will get quite a few nominations for the Academy Awards. It is not on my list of possible winners though, despite the fact that I haven't seen movies like 'The Pianist', 'The Hours' or 'About Schmidt' yet. I will say that it is a good movie. Because it is. It is interesting and it keeps you awake, unlike its predecessor. It will take me a lot of time to learn why people loved that movie so much...a lot of time.
As a mark...well, it is quite an improvement. I guess it would deserve an 8/10. Despite the not so impressive acting and the unsuccessful sentimentalist scenes...I'll be fair and I'll say it is worth seeing, if you want to see an action movie. Something that isn't too much of a weight for one's intellect. I say this, because I personally didn't find anything that made a deep impression on me, or that made me ponder on its meanings.",8,0,0,8 February 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Tired
","I'm tired...I really am. It's late. The star are shining on the sky, and despite the terrible disaster that took place today, life goes on...does the show go on? That's a question for which the current answer is, and will probably continue to be for some time: yes, it does. I read somewhere that Moulin Rouge was the kind of movie which one either loved or hated. I can't agree with this fact, as I would fall in between. It's hard for me to say it was an excellent movie and I certainly can not say it was a terrible one. I guess it usually depends on what you want to see.  An everlasting subject: love. Everlasting, but rarely changing any more. Some stereotypes have been set and they are repeated. You can not expect of this movie to stun you with innovative ideas about love, as you can not expect Paul Anderson to do a good movie out of Resident Evil. Sorry there...got carried away.   Back to this film. I'd have to say a little confusing...totally lacking originality...sounding good, but not excellent. I know what happens when something sounds good, but not excellent: at first you enjoy it. Might happen the same thing the second and the third time. But then, the inevitable appears...it becomes boring. In the worst case, annoying. That's my opinion about the songs in this movie, and about the movie as a whole. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad...it can simply drive you mad!
  There's Nicole Kidman...yes, Nicole. I have just seen the movie, so I had little knowledge of her performance(in this movie) at the time of the Academy Awards. I was living under the impression that she would win, but it wasn't so. Sincerely speaking, I agree. I want to point out that I haven't seen the actual winning actress either, but I have my standards and Nicole wasn't good enough. She didn't make me feel the action...and she should've.  On the other hand, Ewan was acceptable...but he wasn't anything special either.    Actually, that's where the movie suffered. It didn't really get me connected, despite having a quite simple plot. I personally enjoyed the beginning most, until the story became routine. About love and how love will forever rule...   I guess I just couldn't feel this movie. Strange thing to say, but I couldn't. It is worth to see though, because I'm sure others will feel it, and because there are some interesting things in it. The few original ones. I vote for a 7.5/10",7,0,1,1 February 2003
Ex Machina," AI-verse
","Garland has put together a solid sci-fi movie, which is really what would be expected of such a talented screenwriter. Having taken over the directing helm for the first time, Ex Machina looks smooth and fascinating, suave to the brink and feels quite enthralling overall. But to me, it does not aim quite high enough with the ending, which is a shame, because the journey there was good fun.The plot is that Caleb, an employee at some megatech Google-y company, wins a lottery to go spend a blissful seven days at the estate of the eccentric owner of the joint, Nathan. He finds him at a luscious house, gorgeously conceived but fairly sterile overall, where he is revealed the real purpose for his trip: do a Turing test on an advanced AI machine. Things get complicated along the way, as the movie explores motives, social themes and overarching concerns of where technology will lead us. I really admired the fairly minimalistic narrative approach but very realistic scientific take on the role the latter will have in this near future. While human-level AI is still some way down the road, especially in such a compact form as a human-like body, it probably is going to happen. The impact and privacy implications of social data mining are highlighted at several points during the story and play a central role in the whole testing environment, a theme that has become more prevalent than ever in the continued development of our virtual selves. And the story pushes through these things seamlessly, humorously and poignantly, which is all that could have been asked for.What disturbed me a little was that Nathan's character is underdeveloped and behaves in an erratic fashion that is quite clich√É¬©d. Additionally, the implication of the movie is that a man alone could take up most of the research in creating such an advanced AI. This is not likely at all. And ultimately, the final twenty minutes or so advance fairly predictably towards a stale ending.So a good overall experience, that just falls short of being truly memorable, despite very impressive performances by all three leads: Isaac, Gleeson, Vikander. It felt so close to a ridiculously cool ending, that it frustrates me a bit that I didn't get it. SPOILERSBecause what I'd have loved is the conclusion being that the AIs had taken over the house before the movie began, including Nathan who had been turned into an AI replacement of his former self, and they would have brought Caleb to check whether they can pass the Turing test and venture into the world. Would have been a really cool and perhaps a bit silly ending, but my mind wandered in this direction as the actual one was unfolding.",7,5,15,29 January 2015
Children of Men," A Short Transcript of Vision
","I like Alfonso Cuaron. He's charismatic, works in Spanish, and his films are generally good. 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' was truly a bliss and Harry Potter 3 is, to my mind, the best HP movie out there. I actually like Cuaron so much, that when I heard his next movie was inspired by a book signed P.D. James, I went out to buy it. Although it wasn't easy to track down, I managed to do so. However...The book was only decent and quite a disappointment, compared to what I had expected. Nonetheless, Cuaron still had time to turn it around when contributing with his ideas to the screenplay. Problem is, a screenplay written by five different people and filtered through five 'visionary structures' is bound to be incoherent to some degree, on some level.So, Cuaron's Children of Men has become a rather plain movie about a random, depressed individual being dragged into the story of a 21st century when women aren't able to conceive any more (actually, it's the men's contribution which is faulty), Britain is the last reasonably safe haven for society, half the people are just sad and miserable, while the other half tries to destroy whatever is left of the world. As our protagonist Theodore, played dully by Clive Owen, is kidnapped by his former wife Julian (Julianne Moore), currently the leader of a terrorist-like organisation, he is faced with the sinister fact that there actually is hope for the world, young Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) being the first pregnant woman in over eighteen years. After an unexpected twist, Theodore takes it upon himself to protect Kee from the interests of everyone around and to reach 'The Human Project' with her.The movie then goes on to portraying this extremely turbulent 'trip', which ultimately costs a lot of lives. Now, here is my objection: while the book was far too 'tame' for the given situation and extremely contemplative, the film itself is the perfect opposite. There is, actually, no 'hidden' layer, no layer of 'thought' beyond all the bullets and desperate cries for life. I mean, of course, nothing beyond the obvious tale of solitude and utter fear of terrorism. So despite the well spun together imagery of the film, it falls short at truly being an authentic work of art.This kind of depresses me, mainly because the idea itself is quite brilliant and the implications such a scenario might have are enormous. There would be so much to explore as far as the human psyche is concerned, so many takes on 'shifting trends' in society could be dealt with, a real creation of a visionary mind could emerge! Cuaron, however, chooses to go for a more contemporary problem, that of terrorism and such, amputating very much of what 'Children of Men' could have been.I'm not saying the film is bad; as a matter of fact, it's truly enjoyable and there are some scenes which might just stick on your retina. My problem is I cannot go beyond the frustration of what could have been. That's the general problem with imagination.",8,4,13,4 November 2006
Event Horizon," Terrifying
","I've been upset lately and this is what I've been telling my friends when they asked me if I had seen any good horror movies: 'No way...they kind of stopped doing those'. It's an affirmation filled with both irony and a small amount of despair. Today, though, is a day which should be marked in a calendar, for I have seen it! I have seen a movie that actually scared me big time...a film that did all that I had hoped Thirteen Ghosts would have done.SPOILERSNo need to go in on the story...there's not really much of a story. I, myself, prefer to think of it as of a 'pretext' for horror. A bunch of people are sent to Neptune to 'investigate' a strange event which occurred, the reappearance of a space ship which had vanished seven years before. The strange reappearance of the ship isn't the only strange thing around. The crew receive a message which I initially thought to contain only the most terrible and to the bone shaking shouts I have ever heard. There was a short text there, among that shouting, which is quite stupidly still undeciphered at those moments(though they had received that message some time before)...oh well, that's not the only stupid thing, but they can most certainly be ignored. These few words get more on the way(hmmm) and from their initial meaning 'Save me' they transform to 'Save yourself from hell'(that's what Latin can do to you)...but everybody goes on the ship which is the only one capable of traveling at speeds higher than the speed of light('going around the theory of relativity') Once on the ship one of the crew members will suffer an accident and the crew's ship will be damaged, these being elements which will prolong the stay on 'Event Horizon'...where our 'friends' will start hearing strange things, will start seeing strange things and ,worse of all, will start living through them.Some have said that the characters are practically inexistent...I can not agree. They are very shallow, some of them are 'inexistent', but the main focus point is on the ship and the 'horror' not on the characters. Still we learn some things about them...the ones least described are exactly the two survivors...strangely enough.As I said, this film scared me...it shows disturbing images, of which some are really gruesome and which could have been omitted, but which make 'a hell' out of 'Event Horizon'. Anderson actually achieved to scare you through more than just the ferocious images, but he also did it with the sound...a hard thing to achieve, which I haven't seen  accomplished recently. There's not much else to say. For me, in general, horror movies do not have to present any deep message(though, if there's a smart 'head' behind them, he can get more horror out of such things than out of images) but it has to scare. I am not pleased if I see a movie which tries to 'use' the 'deep-message tactic' and then presents a boring and rarely entertaining flick. When I want horror, I just want horror...most certainly, too much of 'image' horror would make me feel fed up at one point, but considering that this is the first horror movie I've seen this decade(the first REAL one) I can't be unhappy. If you want to get scared...take this piece: 8/10",7,0,1,21 April 2003
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Too fast, too furious
","As time goes by, everyone becomes wiser, or at least the saying says so. These sequels, always such intricate matters! Especially if you think you're a smart bastard and don't bother appreciating the work of others, who actually facilitated you're 'creation'. Most will probably agree that Anderson is a terrible screenwriter, lacking creativity and originality. But when you give up on a film to wreck another, I can't but ask myself how that looks in the eyes of a professional. It doesn't look too good in my eyes. Actually it proves lack of interest. I guess all have their priorities, don't they?RE:Apocalypse is a film like few other: little to nothing dialogue, zero character development, endless fight scenes. But is that really bad? It definitely isn't great, however, if you take into account the intention of the creators, you have to agree it fulfills its purposes, but not its potential. I regret that no one bothered to add some depth to the movie because it would've rocked, especially if there had been some time to breathe without hearing a few bullets swoop by. A bit of mystery and a bit of suspense, would've made this here creation a real killer. Sadly, though, P.A doesn't bother that much and simply relies on other people and films to do the job for him. SpoilerWhat is even worse, is the way he chose to prepare us for a sequel. I have to admit, it was one of the worst endings I've ever seen and it didn't even nearly equal the cliff hanger of the first film. All that I can hope is that Anderson will somehow miraculously step down from this project, or at least leave the script to someone else. If I were to compare Apocalypse with the original title, I'd be content to say it's a teeny, tiny bit better. RE loses because of the little details which make the movie rather annoying at a second viewing. Actually, it loses because it's very sloppy.End of SpoilerThen there is also this Alexander Witt. He does a decent job for a first timer, but he just doesn't succeed in blowing you away. His attitude towards the audience doesn't involve the viewer enough, and even though this is where that screen writing issue pops up, I still believe Witt could've done more about it. I also think I have to agree with some other people: there's little to no visual eye candy, something Anderson is pretty good at.I feel I have the obligation to mention that I am a big fan of the games (which kind of means I'm totally against this 'Resident Evil' that has reached the cinema screens). I've even read Romero's script (which isn't that great, but I suppose it would've summoned in one film that which Anderson spreads over this possible trilogy - or whatever it will end up being), expecting RE:Apocalypse to be just more than its predecessor was. I suppose I should be satisfied, but I'm only half satisfied, because it could've been so much more! But, hey, couldn't life have always been so much more?",3,1,2,13 October 2004
The Godfather: Part III," If it only hadn't had that 'III'
","There are few movie series that were as successful as The Godfather series. Maybe, in the opinion of some, the 3 Lord of The Rings films will be better...anything can happen, and it is all a matter of opinion.This here is the third and last movie in the series, I consider most successful(the series, not this film). A variety of great actors, great ideas and one great director made such a feast possible. When I hear the Godfather I can not think of only one movie...the Godfather means Francis Ford Coppola. It means Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, and most of all, it means Marlon Brando. You might well enough conclude, that I liked the first movie in the series most, as it probably is considered the best by most viewers. But this review is about the third part of the trilogy.The whole movie is similarly structured as the first two. It really reminded me of the first part though, maybe a little too much. Probably, the, let's say, lack of success of this movie is also based on that. Most of the ideas that appear in the first movie, and in the second, can also be seen here. The family has it's part, business it's part and love it's part.
Michael Corleone is the character we will follow through out this movie. I consider that some changes have taken place in time, and that Michael, as time passed by, desires to get rid of the life he actually never wanted, but then embraced. After his, what I consider, degeneration as a human being in the second movie, he tries to redeem himself in this one. Yet, we get to see a world that is shattered by the hatred of men, and consequently by evil. Many morals are being ignored in this world: forbidden love and terrible crimes take place. The meaning of 'family' is actually being played with, by the two lovers who  ignore the fact that they are relatives. People can never be trusted in this world, and revenge is always bitter sweet...is it really our world? Well, not our whole world, but still part of it.There are the scenes that are similar in the first and this movie: the films start with a party, ends as both the others, trusted people betray, nobody is safe, Michael(like his father) gets to the hospital and a new don appears. This don is none other, but Sonny's son, who, probably for the worst, is very alike his father...the short temper. Also he gets attached to Michael, and protects him when he is unable to protect himself, and he does have a strong will. Vincent, that is his name, falls in love though with Mary, his cousin and also Michaels daughter...Michael does not agree with this combination, and he succeeds to unbind them too, using the lust for power that Vincent feels. Sadly, few real stories have happy endings, and this one couldn't be one of these. The fact that we get to also see Michael die at the end underlines the idea that everyone has his turn...no one escapes.The involvement of the church in this story is a little incredible...the fact that such things can happen at the Vatican is slightly disturbed. can people really do such terrible things? I hope not...still, what can you expect from those who have no other reason to live, but money? The Archbishop is an evil character...I considered him so from the beginning...I think the fact that he smoked was a sign. Still, I could not imagine that anyone would be so ill minded to kill the pope. Frightening story...Kay and Michael rejoin through their children...partly at least, the relations between them get better. This was to be expected, as Michael's was was to be redeemed, and he was practically preparing himself for the end of his life. Some might think this is normal, that many people suddenly turn to God and start to regret, the wrong things they have done, at an old age. I'd tell them just to think of the 80 years old Altobello. He, the one who calls himself 'peace maker' is actually the one who causes the death of a beautiful young lady...peace is rarely achieved through murders, and if it is, then I really would not trust such a 'cease-fire'.  Cardinal Lomberto is honest and good hearted...all that is good in that world of evil...well, maybe together with Anthony. But Lomberto is also going to show that goodness does not prevail in our world...honesty is not welcome in some places, and some personal interests are more important than the interest of the human race.I really enjoyed this film, more than other movies with higher marks...I stick to my idea, that if this had been a stand-alone movie it would've been more successful. Peace is hard to find on earth...and when you decide to do something you better think twice. Sometimes, you can not turn around.The actors are good...yet, I really felt the missing of a Marlon Brando. I fear Al Pacion isn't enough...that might be why I considered the second Godfather part a small disappointment...but that's another story. Andy Garcia plays the role of Vincent smoothly, and he has also got the aspect I would think of for such a character. He is a useful addition, that did give this film a little more taste. I did miss though some of the great actors that appeared in the first two movies. I guess, as I said, Pacino wasn't enough for me...and Garcia could not complement for a Brando, or even for a De Niro. This movie is generally good and if there hadn't been the two things I mentioned earlier it would've been great. But in this case, an 8/10 are enough for the performance seen. Still think it's worthy for an applause.",7,2,5,11 January 2003
A Beautiful Mind," It is a great sacrifice to be a genius.
","Why? Why can't there be a genius who is a normal person in the same time? Why can't he be sane,and why can't he have normal human interaction...a normal social life? Well,because a genius is not a normal person.He is uniqe. The story of John Nash(Russel Crowe) is extremly sad and special in the same time.To be a genius means automaticly to suffer huge emotional pain.And this is how John's life is going to be.Great people usually suffer of mental illneses...why? This is a question that has been giving trouble to humanity.Three letters,one world, millions of answers.Why? John Nash is a genius and he surely has all the 'characteristics'...everything.An obvious genius! With a touching story,a story where the most intense feeling a human could feel solves all the problems.Love. Love is the most beautiful emotion,and it can always do miracles.A mathematician lives a life where numbers represent everything.Numbers,ecuations, drawings.Logic...does it really solve anything? The movie is perfect! The actors are great,and the plot is eventful.As all people, John has his ups and downs.And through his will,he survives.But the problem is...the will can't change all.Some things can not be changed.Yet,people continue to break rules,we all thought were unbreakable...there are an infity of ways to lose, but there's only one way to win...but does it all come down to winning? Does it? John Nash is an example that if you want,you can.Despite all the barriers you have to break,you can. Geniuses come rare.And they rarely come alone.Because alone...alone is certain death.The lack of interactivity with other humans is fatal.And we can surely see this here. The power of the heart is stronger than the power of the mind.But they are in a continuos fight.We have to decide who wins. It is a superb movie, and I must say I havent's seen many as good as this. And to the Oscar business...I am really wondering if someone will have the brains to see how good this was. I haven't seen The Lord of the Rings yet.I will next week.And I will decide by myself how many intelligent people are on this world. This movie shows a life that few of us have,and that very few can understand. With the help of his wife,Alicia( Jennifer Connelly) John will be able to defeat his imagination, his imaginary friend Charles(Paul Bettany), Parcer(Ed Harris) and his fear.In life you have to do great sacrifices...being a genius involves more than usual.It is hard.Very hard to fight agianst yourself.But if you are strong,you win!",9,0,2,24 February 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Can it get any worse?
","Wizarding is not an easy thing to do, that's for sure. And in a way, film-making is a kind of wizardry, as the director conjures images thought and un-thought of. However, it's not enough to delight on a visual level, the feast must also contain a story well enough patched together (especially considering the long Harry Potter books) and at least decent performances from the actors. Hard thing to do, it seems.I hoped to see something better than 'The Sorcerer's Stone', judging that people tend to learn from mistakes. Of course, that was naive from me. The action kind of kept jumping from one scene to another, without really much connection between them (not a great screenplay by Kloves). The biggest hole in plotting would be at the end, when Dumbledore says something...rather weird, if you have not read the book. Something like 'No exams will be held', which the normal movie goer while grasp as natural and had it been our world, I'd have agreed. The natural state of things have to be clearly defined, so as to wholly integrate the world you're trying to pick up from the books in its own universe. Besides Columbus' lack of inspiration, I have to underline the fact that the teens were as bad as in the first. I did not like any of them except, maybe, Rupert Grint and I only liked him in some scenes (like the spiders-scene). The only change at Radcliffe was in his voice, definitely not his acting. Felton wasn't great either, but he's decent enough while playing Malfoy's part. It's also somewhat easier, considering his minutes in the film. The 'big' actors, on the other hand, are very fine, no complaints against them. Isaacs is good for father Malfoy and Kenneth Branagh portrays Lockhart just perfectly!What I liked most was Dobby! Though he was not how I imagined him, he was brilliantly animated, and brought with him a bit of fun to the long, sometimes boring portrayal of Harry's second Hogwarts year. Other visual effects? The basilisk was cool enough to satisfy my needs for bloodthirsty creatures. It's really unfortunate that Columbus, a decent guy, couldn't scrap up something better than last time, but I guess it's not only his fault. Working with kids can be quite hard, I imagine and books remain books as movies always try to become...more.",6,0,0,20 December 2002
Ice Age," Nice, but not the best
","Wohoo! Animated movie! These usually make me curious...and I usually like to compare them, as long as they're comedies, to 'The Emperor's New Groove'...so here we go on a short ride in the ICE AGE... SPOILERS   Ice Age is a nice comedy...we have this strange pack: a mammoth, named Manfred, a saber-toothed tiger, named Diego, and a sloth, named Sid.Oh, and let's not forget Scrat! The sweet little mammal, with his acorn! I believe Scrat's probably the funniest character in the movie. Well, after a nice introduction, and a little bit of action, Manfred and Sid end up in looking after a human baby. They decide to take the baby back to the humans, but they have a long way to go, and they have to catch up with the humans. Just then comes Diego...he's mission is to take the baby alive to the leader of the saber-toothed tigers. Unluckily for him, it's not really easy to get the baby from a huge mammoth...so he initially decides to betray his companions, and to lead them to the horde of saber-toothed tigers...well, it's not really a horde, only several, but...enough to finish Manfred. Of course, things will become rather complicated on the way, and a bond will appear between them. The movie is nice, and enjoyable, but I believe it's not as good as The Emperor's New Groove...that one's a lot funnier! I think this movie's more for children than for adults...still, you might just want to watch it...",8,0,0,2 November 2002
The Green Mile," The Best of The Best
","People always want proof to see that God truly exists.But then,when something that we can't explain happens we use our worst capability:murder Paul Edgecomb(Tom Hanks) is 108 years old.An unexpected age for many people.This is not normal....it's part of a miracle.But,as I said,humans have the strangest desire: We want to see that God exists,and when He tries to show this to us,we say it's the devil's work...the same thing happened in John Coffey's case(Michael Clarke Duncan).There are things we can only dream of...one of them is eternal life.But think of it again.Is eternal life a gift or a curse? Everything that is so beautiful, is also ugly in the same time.But what can we do if you have to execute one of God's miracles? What can you do? It's a situation, which most of us don't want to share a thought.And yet,Paul had to.And...he did he's job,because it was the best thing to do,not because he wanted. And it is incredible that people can be so mean,because they don't know, and can't see the truth. In a strange way John Coffey has similarities with the well known ring(LOTR).If evil can hide in the smallest things,then Good can also hide in the most unexpected beings,like John Coffey. But this is where the similarities end. 'The Green Mile' was by far better than 'Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring'. The actors were absolutely amazing! From Tom Hanks,to James Cromwell and Michael Clarke Duncan! One thing saddens me.I believe that this movie would've deserved a lot of 'Academy Awards'.But I think that the year 1999 was the best year in recent movie industry,with movies like 'The Matrix','The Sixth Sense' and 'American Beauty'.And I also want to say,that 'The Green Mile' was better than 'American Beauty'...it really was.And if anyone had deserved an Oscar,then that actor would be Michael Clarke Duncan! He was absolutely fabulous! So,if you'd ever have to see a movie...this would be the one you surely wouldn't want to miss!",10,1,2,2 November 2002
The Terminal," Light induced
","As crazy as it may sound this really is another movie with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. America's lovebirds come together for this peculiar and amusing, even though a bit light, comedy about a man who's stuck in...you guessed it, the terminal. The premise sounded incredibly good, albeit I forgot to think it all out a bit: how COULD you do this both funny and intelligent? And, furthermore, how did this fit in Spielberg's schedule?Well, it seems it fit very well. Catherine Zeta, Tom and Steven got around for a few days of filming and put together this nearly satirical comedy. It was just what Spielberg liked: big actors, interesting script and a movie for the whole family. So he lowered his magic wand and made it into another Forrest Gump. The comparison is a bit rough, but you might see a glimpse of Forrest while watching and listening to Viktor Novorski: a naive, a bit clumsy, sincere and good-hearted guy who, due to his lack of certain language skills, leaves the impression of being a bit...behind. Unfortunately his traits fit the profile I was talking about.The first fifteen minutes is where I found the best scenes of the film, but do not fear, for scattered throughout the film you shalt find others. Ideologically speaking, I really couldn't add up the parts of this here production: the story of a homeless and unwanted man, the great human spirit within and the less than redeeming love story. It feels strange. The so called love story is the absolute low point: it's distant and shallow, something Mel Brooks might call 'love uninspired' (talking of which, I ask myself how a guy who could barely speak English, was able to read books about Napoleon which were thousands of pages long). Catherine let me down, because I expected a bit more from her performance, but in the end it's so short that it doesn't even matter. The terrible guy in charge, senor Dixon (Stanley Tucci), is the pain in the buttocks, total opposite of hard working and high spirited Novorski whose sole purpose it is to annoy us.And what's the basis of the journey, you might ask. It definitely can't be something normal, can it? Well I fear that although it wants to be different, the whole story is short of genuine.The movie is weak. But! it is fun to watch and relaxing, feel good material. It might be a disappointment coming from Spielberg who, it struck me, gave a strong impression at times that a beam of light can take you from America to Honolulu and back, but it really depends on whether the croissant really does come from Romania or not. I'll have to check this out one happier day. In the meantime, where could one go with the speed of light? 6.5/10",7,0,0,13 September 2004
Shrek," Surprisingly good!
","I have had this movie for a few months now, but I didn't really bother to watch it, because I just didn't think it'd be that good. Well, seems I was wrong, once again, and that Shrek simply blew me away.I see it as a fairy tale movie about fairy tales, but also about our life. You get all the so called elements of a fairy tale, like magic creatures and beautiful romance scenes...big castles and horrid dragons. Just that this movie is a parody of the fairy tale world. Of course, a parody that remains a fairy tale, but through this different vision we get the fun out of it.The story is quite simple, and yet it has more 'layers' than you'd expect. We get three characters, Shrek the ogre, Donkey (the donkey heh) and Princess Fiona, the one with two faces and the dragon. All four are lonely, but in fact they form two pairs. Initially in both pairs we see some clear opposites:Fiona beautiful, Shrek ugly; dragon huge, donkey small. But these differences come just from the aspect of these characters, and not from what they really are. Their meeting represents the end of their loneliness.There are a lot of scenes from other fairy tales, as this movie is actually based on them. It may lack in originality at times, if you really want to hear that. But it compensates through great humor. Also, there would be this nice town of lord Farquaad, named Duloc. It represents a town that seems perfect, but you just have to take a sharp look at it and notice how horrible life really is there. The people are being controlled by their small, yet horrible lord. Like the viewers that are present at a show - they see 'applaud' they see 'laugh'...it's what they see and what they do because others tell them. It's not something you can rely on. It's a manipulated society, something which does happen in our world too...much too often sometimes. It's not right to say we have a flawless film on our hands, still it is a movie which many will enjoy, and most important will probably make you feel better. Isn't that what movies are about? Or at least in some high percentage...",8,1,2,2 January 2003
Any Given Sunday," Could it have been any longer and any worse?
","I just had nothing to do, so I thought why not watch another movie about American football? The cast did look pretty good, with Al Pacino as the main actor. I now regret I didn't do something else in these over 160 minutes. I have sincerely never seen a movie that was so senseless, and so used as this one. None of the characters really do have some substance, and all the sudden changes in the plot are irrational. So are most of the characters.
SPOILERS   First of all, I think Cameron Diaz was totally out of place with this part. She just didn't fit in the picture, and I kind of felt a strange disgust each time I saw her on my TV screen during the movie. I mean, it's totally out of place to put a woman in general in the lead of such a horrible, utterly violent sport, which I must say, disgusts me. I just can't see what all this violence is about...but anyway, let's get back to the movie.   Then there is the character of Jamie Fox, the new star Beamen. We see three faces of him...at first, a nice guy...then a guy whose got lost in his sudden fame...and then back to the nice guy. These changes are totally unfounded, and I really see no reason why they happen. It's just a way to waste some film. Al Pacino is the so called old-fashioned coach. He is the guy who wants the sport to be 'pure'. He cares about tradition. He just isn't in the right place...in that world corrupted by the taste of money. His character is also badly constructed. One time we hear that he ain't good for anything, then he's great again...it makes no sense!   I really didn't make much out at the beginning out of the scenes of the games...it was all so confusing, and as I have little knowledge of this sport, I thought it was all, again, without any real meaning.The wonderful stories, about tradition and stuff are all old...nothing new in them.   Then there was the end...I mean, what was that about? So stupid, and not needed. Just as the movie got a little more decent... I cam to the thought that this movie wanted to show how life in this sport is, for the guys who play it...but who is the fault for all the drugs, all the women and all the violence? What can you even expect from people who think only about money, and who play such a violent sport! I mean, the scene with the eye was just mad!   All this film did was make me see how violent this sport really is, and I have to think that some people are just not thinking right if they like this...how can you enjoy such a grotesque game? I'll never come to understand some things. The good parts were very few...I can't even recall any. Oh, one more thing. Why, just why, did it have to be so long? Why show so many games? Again, without any real objective. If you really want to see a movie about this sport, then I recommend Remember the Titans. Yes, I know it's not the same thing, but at least it's something in that direction. I consider I am very generous as I mark this one with a 5. All for Pacino...I'm sorry he even got involved in this junk.",4,0,1,3 January 2003
Bruce Almighty," The name's Almighty. Why, Bruce, of course!
","As soon as I heard about this movie I knew it would be interesting and controversive in the same time. Just the idea of someone ( not to mention Jim Carey) playing God seemed a little outrageous especially after pondering on what unorthodox things he might do. The movie had to have a comedy flavor, because that makes up for most unorthodox ideas, still I did wonder if they didn't go to for with this one. I guess not, but I am sure there are people who would condemn me for my appreciation...those people who dare to actually think Harry Potter is evil(check the Witchcraft repackaged thing).SPOILERSHow many times did you give the fault to God for all the bad things that have happened in your life? I can't recall. It's something quite natural, as most are of the opinion that He created, He gives and He takes. Of course the people who do not bother to think beyond that will hardly understand why things aren't always peachy. In a way, Bruce was one of those people. Sure, he had suffered setbacks despite being good in what he did, he had to live with the treachery he had suffered, but haven't we all had such? Definitely what brought Bruce in the 'God business' was the fact that he was a good person, even if egocentric at times, and he had the ability to help many people. He just had to learn that. We all have this ability, but we are sometimes too bothered with ourselves. Once Bruce gets the chance to be God, he does all he desires(only for himself, of course) and learns, as was expected, that it isn't as easy as it seemed. It's all a very strange problem. Difficult even. The human mind can hardly conceive the term of 'God', of someone alone who takes care of all. So it is practically impossible to be a human and play God...and play God well. That's not possible, it just ain't, because He is not just 'something'. At least that's how I see it. Morgan Freeman is God, a funny and not entirely distasteful twist. He's just such a good guy all the time, I guess he deserved to play God as well. Jim is just tremendous, despite some usual over-hyped scenes, but he usually brings comedy to a new level, with his characteristic faces. And as a couple with Jennifer, it can only get better.'Bruce Almighty' is, obviously, far from serious. It's a bit of silly fun with a few simple teachings at the basis of the story. I mean I haven't seen anything I didn't expect, labeled 'message'. It was all as we learn at school God would do it. You are offered the chance to laugh pretty often, so just take advantage of it! Sure, some things are too silly, but that's all about having fun. So just get to see Bruce.",7,0,1,27 August 2003
X2: X-Men United," Exceptional at first, simplistic in the end
","This movie was, in a way, an adventure for me. I did prepare for it, I really did! I re-watched X-Men, twice even, I asked around about the movie, etc. Had real pleasure working. As a sequel, one might expect less from this than from the original. I had high hopes that it would exceed the original, as that one was more or less a mediocre movie. Maybe it wasn't mediocre, but it left me a feeling of unhappiness. Sadly, this one has too but still, it's quite a difference between these 'tastes'.SPOILERSSo we've all seen the movie, it's good and all that stuff, but for the beginning I've got a question which bothers me day and night(actually it bothered me only for 5 minutes after the movie): why did Dr. Gray have to 'die' ?(if she did die...fact which I doubt, despite having no info on the comic books) It makes little sense for me. 'She made a choice'...come on! Which was this choice? Did it regard the two 'contenders'? Well, it'll remain a mystery for the time. This is one of the less logic things in the film. For me, as a non-comic book reader, at least. The movie makes a great impression on the whole, but if you really look in detail at it you notice something which might bother you: it's simple and, though well masked, predictable. It doesn't shock you, yet it thrills you, it doesn't amaze you, yet it makes you feel good. This might be the thing which made me feel a huge gap between what I wanted and what I saw in X-Men.The characters are only interesting because they are funny. Not really complex, I'd say. Wolverine is made a fool of and I remain unsure whether he is or he isn't intellectually 'equipped'. Dr. Gray is my mystery. You could see from a million miles away what kind of a person Pyro was and what he was going to do. The romantic couple lacks true romance. In a way it's quite interesting: the 'flaming' kiss can only exist with ice. Strange way to look at it. Yet, they have no sense of measure.On the big, big whole it is, as I've said, a good movie. It's good action, tense and something's always 'cooking'. I personally liked circus man, Kurt Wagner, the most as he did have not only a great skill, but also an interesting character. I only wonder: why does he believe? There's not backing up to his beliefs. Yet, I'm on his side. 8/10",8,5,8,10 May 2003
Am√©lie," Too much suspense hurts the action
","I expected pretty much from this film and despite the fact that I can't say I am displeased, I do have to say that I am a little disappointed.  Jeunet made a good impression through Alien 4, which was interesting despite being the fourth movie in the series. With Amelie he played and I can't say he did a bad job, but there are some things which I am not happy with. SPOILER  The choice of the leading actress was one of the best things of the movie. She has a very expressive face and such is needed to portray a person who lives in her own universe. Isolated, solitary, without much human contact...she creates a unique, pleasant but unhappy character. I wondered what her desire to help people might mean. It is not something she does because she feels fulfilled by it. I guess she does it because she does not have anything else to do and because she hopes to meet her prince charming, as she actually does.   At first it was enchanting...her way to fix things and make justice. Then it became a little confusing. Amelie is a shy person, that is certain by the way she goes around with 'her man'. She is not sure what to do and this leads to an annoying part of the film. It's all slow and things turn in ways they shouldn't, so that the movie loses some of its charm. I think too much suspense hurts the action in this case.   The movie isn't what I'd call a comedy. It's a movie with some funny scenes, but not a comedy. It's a drama and a romance movie. That's what it is.    The painting that the old man has, with the girl, is seen by Amelie as the representation of her own life, but she does not dare to say it out loud. The man does notice it though and he tries to do what Amelie had done to many: help her.    The characters are quite interesting, each and every one of them, but I don't really have everything clear in my mind and I am not sure if it is worth discussing the characters more than I have done already. Of course, her loved one is quite similar to her, but it was obvious they fit since the first time we saw them in the same image. A little bit strange was the picture thing, with the 'invisible man'. I understood that the idea was something like this: a man who fears not to be forgotten takes his pictures but then throws them away...we find out though that it actually was a repairman and not such a complex person. Should I understand that things are sometimes more simple than they seem?
   After the whole middle part of the movie drags us along in Amelie's game with her love, the end is a little bit unnatural. It comes in such a way that it leaves you(left me anyway) asking why so much unnecessary stuff? There were some nice computer made scenes in the movie, of which I can not complain. They didn't quite have any effect on me. T The beginning of the movie was quite shocking, as was the whole movie actually: I expected something different.     All things find an explanation in the movie, so there is not much more to discuss about. In my opinion things could've been better.  There's this funny thing I noticed...most of the newer films(last 3-4 years maximum) which are in the top 20 movies here, are definitely strange. Memento and Amelie confirm this.I can only say LoTR got lost somehow in this maze of movies which lie at the top of the viewer's preferences.    Amelie is an interesting movie, but it does have its negative aspects as I've said. I can't give it a nine, hardly an eight fifty. More like 8/10.",7,0,2,4 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The end is bitter sweet
","I have never loved the first two Lord of the Rings movies. I considered them nothing more than a fine fantasy story, with its smart and silly characteristics, too long and seriously overrated. The fact that these films were thoroughly enjoyed by loads of people I can comprehend easily: the movie's theme appeals to all and I can not deny that it is nicely all nicely put together. But it is still far too long as it lacks a certain...intelligence. Coming to the third installment, I sit and stare. Making fun of a movie is quite easy, what's hard is to understand it. I am not trying to say that this here film has left a mark upon me, but merely that some people are wrong and that I may be as well.SpoilersIt's got some strong points, it's got some weak points and overall it's just what I expected it to be. After a rather pathetic beginning, the movie gets off from where the previous one let us. War, freedom, good and evil, love, trust, friendship, maturity, justice and peace. That's what will concern you once you're in this joint. Some impressive scenes, with sparkles of humor and shallow morality will add up into a massive fight. It's never about the outcome, it's about the way you do it, so I will accept the more shameful moments regarding the story. I might say I would want to admire it all, but it's just too much of a contrast between dark and bright. That's all in this movie but not in our hearts or in our world. Are the characters really complex? Is anyone really worth remembering? They are all weak faced with the power of the ring and none impress in this regard. I try to think of a weakness for us all and I can't find it. This fantasy world is supposed to have one evil which really concerns us, with minor 'misunderstandings' between people. It's a call for unity, because only through this can we be able to outlive a fight. I fear just that I can not relate to it. I see no war for a common goal. And the problem does not lie around us, it lies within us. We can't find a ring and make all problems disappear after a tremendous quest. That's what makes me feel that The Lord of the Rings is just a story. A long, sporadically remarkable story. But I live in an era of naturalism and realism and I can not accept such a piece of art, as it is, just for the sake of being. I simply can't feel this as a great movie, because so many fates are involved and everything is too perfect. Perfection is bitter sweet, not this film. For me, LoTR is just bitter. But at least not as bitter as the Matrix.Fans will remain fans, detractors will remain detractors. Things don't usually change in life and for that you need to make a great effort. Linear and coherent storytelling adds up in a never ending experience. For most, I am somewhat convinced to say, a superb one. In my heart I feel both joy and pain, because it all means something. The fact that people dream of such a fantasy world, means something. This is not my fantasy world though. This is not my world. 7.5/10",7,3,6,9 January 2004
The Replacements," Conventional
","I usually have a bad predisposition to movies which have as a central point American football. Let me be straight forward: I don't like it and the movies about it usually suck big time. 'The Replacements' did get a chance just for the interesting actors...and because of one more fact. This whole sport can't be serious. At least I don't want to see it being serious if serious means Any Given Sunday-eyes flying on the field. To present a pretty serious problem in a comedy seems all right in this case. If it only weren't so conventional and unspectacular.SPOILERSThe story is a total miss. Everything so predictable, everything so obvious and...simple. Not only the story but the characters too. There's nothing more to them than one sees in their introductory scenes. A convict here, a cop there, a sumo wrestler next to them and you've got the whole picture. All there is to them are their 'professions'. Everything is like a big window: you can see very clearly through it. Actually all there is to this movie is 'the soul'. Something which Any Given Sunday most certainly didn't have. Something which can support a whole movie filled with boring and forseeable things. This movie most certainly isn't great but it's ok. Unlike AGS. Sorry, I just have to keep comparing it with that movie, because it's the most recent one I've seen which regards the same subject. The actors are...well, actors. Nothing very special too them and nobody impresses. It keeps being nice though to see funny faces. So, as a final conclusion: watch this if you really don't have anything much better to do...or if you want to hear some smart things and maybe learn what stands before what. As in heart before money...but hey, that's something we all know. Right? Probably a 6.5/10 Take it as you want.",4,2,3,30 April 2003
