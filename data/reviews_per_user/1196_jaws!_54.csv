The Devil's Advocate," A pretty entertaining movie!
","This movie was pretty good. A bit overlong, but pretty good. The final showdown is the highlight of the movie in my opinion. I wish the rest of the movie could have been as good as the final showdown, but it was pretty entertaining, but not didn't go overboard. I give it **1/2 out of ****",Null,1,2,7 April 1999
The Blair Witch Project," interesting at times,but not one bit scary
","boy was i sucked into the hype for this movie. i knew going in it wasn't going to be the scariest movie evermade,but i thought i would be scared. i wasn't scared theleast bit. how easy do you people get scared? even thoughthe movie wasn't an inch scary it was interesting at times. like at the beginning about the myth of the blairwitch,and it had some humor at times. the people in thetheatre i was in just laughed at the whole movie. even atthe serious parts. the fear of the kids in this movie onlycaused laughs among the people in the theatre. the endingpretty much came out of nowhere. when it ended i was likeis that it? the movie like other people have said was likewatching someone's home movies. the movie could've beenscary if maybe they would've shown whatever was stalkingthem. even if it was just a second it could've been scary.the movie still could've been scary even without seeingwhat was stalking them,if the sounds would've been as spooky as the hype says. i don't know why people are calling this movie original when it rips off another moviecalled cannibal holocaust. plus i don't know whats so original about hearing the F word every 3 seconds either.but still there is interesting parts of the movie. theonly part of the movie i felt cheated at was the so-calledbeyond scary parts. i think a lot long time horror fanswon't like this movie. but critics and independent filmfans will like it. all in all not bad in the interestingdepartment,but falls flat in the so-called scary department. i givethe blair witch project **1/2 out of ****. my rating could've been higher if it was scary.",6,1,2,2 August 1999
Scarface," the edited for tv version is hilarious

Fight Club," one of the best,if not (THE) best movie i've seen all year so far
","wow what a mind blowing movie this is. the movie is so strange,and at the same time so good. you'll just have to see it to believe it. it's full of twists,and turns. this movie isn't just about a bunch of guys beating the crap outta each other. it's also about weird mind games. the first rule of fight is do not talk about fight club. the second rule is DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT. so i won't,but i'll tell you to just go see it. it's one of the best,if not (THE) best movie i've seen all year so far. i give fight club ***1/2 out of ****",10,0,1,17 October 1999
Rocky V," another pretty good rocky movie
","rocky V is a pretty good movie. in my opinion it's even better than the first one. it holds your attention more than the first one does, but rocky V isn't as entertaining as 2,3,and 4. but it packs a punch. not a giant punch but a punch. they tried too hard to make a love story in this movie. instead of using the formula from rock 3,and 4.the formula that never gets tiresome. but this movie is still watchable. i give this movie **1/2 out of ****",Null,5,7,10 April 1999

"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Funny,but after a while tiresome
","The first 20 minutes of this movie is hilarious. Then after that the bad language,and jokes get repeated over and over again, but once in a while there's a laugh-out loud part after the first 20 minutes. Also there's way too many songs. This movie is not as funny as Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. And it can't hold a candle to American Pie. But the South Park movie is still funny at times.

Blade," it's ok
","blade has a lot of action in it,but most of it isn't thatinteresting. plus the story is weak. i was hoping i would've liked this movie.  the 80's were the last timereally good fighting movies came out. in my opinion there's hardly ever been a really good fighting movie comeout in the 90's. but the idea of a guy fighting vampires is pretty cool,it's just the movie just didn'tdeliver that much. i give blade ** out of ****",Null,0,1,28 July 1999
The Terminator," big thrills!
",i like the terminator better than the second one. a lot ofpeople like the second the best. the second one is a big-budget movie thats less entertaining than this one. ijust think it's more entertaining to see a human vs. robotthan a robot vs. robot. it's way more interesting to seewhat a human will come up with against a robot than what arobot will come up against another robot. plus the storyto the first terminator is more interesting and less confusing than the second one. all in all the terminatoris a thrill ride. i give the terminator *** out of ****,8,1,1,28 July 1999

","i liked forrest gump. it was a very smart,and well-crafted movie. it pretty much has it all. i was pretty shocked by this movie. i thought it was another big hyped-up movie,but it wasn't. it was a good movie. people can talk bad about this movie all they want. they're maybe the same people that believe movies like psycho,rocky,and the texas chainsaw massacre are classics please.now those movies are movies that are over-hyped,and highly overrated.i give forrest gump *** out of ****",Null,0,2,13 April 1999
Top Secret!," why do some people say this movie is underrated?
","top secret! is not one bit underrated. it's mostly a silly spoof. some laughs,but most of this movie is silly gags more than funny gags, but there are some funny moments. my favorite is where val kilmer is looking out the window of the train or bus i can't remember,and he sees a tree moving,and a guy chasing after it. that's just too funny. i wish this movie had more moments like that one. i give this movie **1/2 out of ****",Null,0,2,10 April 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," another teen movie that's one of the best I've seen of the 90's!

American Pie," man i loved this movie!
","american pie was hilarious!. this is the first movie i've seen in a while that has likeable characters to go with truly hilarious movie. theres been teen movies that are funny,that have came out in the 90's,but none i can call hilarious. this is the funniest teen movie in years. it's also very entertaining. in my opinion american pie is in the top three of the best teen movies of the 90's!. it could also be (THE) best teen movie of the 90's!. but it's at least the funniest. american pie is also the funniest movie of the year. i thought i would not see another movie this year be as funny as austin powers: the spy who shagged me. untill american pie came around. american pie is funnier than austin powers,and blows away the south park movie. the jokes and bad language got old after awhile in south park. the jokes in american pie never get old. american pie is maybe the best movie i've seen this year so far,with summer of sam a tad behind. im gald to see R-rated teen movies back. like varsity blues and american pie. i hope they keep makin' R-rated teen movies instead of PG-13. but there are still some PG-13 teen movies that are still really good,like 10 things i hate about you. but the best are the R-rated ones. the plot for american pie is very original. and some scenes in american pie have the original feel to them. american pie is a bout four friends that are seniors in high school who are also virgins. once they find out that the nerdiest kid in school has just scored,they make a pact to lose their virginity. most of the humor comes from jim played by (jason biggs). he gets caught doing everything. the father and son talks are very funny. all the characters are very likeable,and cool. i've seen this movie 3 times already. i will see it more. there are so many scenes that are unforgetable. it should become a teen movie classic. i also think american pie is funnier than most comedies from last year,like theres something about mary,and others. all in all a great movie! i give american pie ***1/2 out of****",9,0,0,19 July 1999
American Beauty," a good movie that makes you think about your life
","i liked american beauty. it had great performances all around. spacey's performance was the best,and my favorite character in the movie. my second favorite character was bentley's character ricky. the soundtrack is really good,i enjoyed those 70's rock songs in it. a lot of the scenes are in your face. the movie is about a 42 year-old man named lester who pretty much hates his life. he hates his wife,and doesn't spend much time with his unhappy daughter jane either. jane doesn't like herself. next door a family just moved in. the father is a mean ex-marine,his wife is a depressing human being,his son is a dope-dealer who also video tapes just about everything he sees. lester gets turned on by his daughter's best friend angela,who is a hottie. he has fantasies about angela. lester's wife carolyn is obsessed with her real-estate job,and likes a fellow real-estate agent who calls himself the king, they later sleep together. lester has a wake-up call when he finds out his daughter's best friend thinks he's cute. lester starts working out,smoking pot with the next door kid ricky. lester also buys a new car,he quits his job,and blackmails his boss. he gets a new job flipping burgers at a fast food joint. lester's daughter jane begins to know a little more about the next door kid ricky,and starts to like him. i won't give too much away just go see it. it's an unpredictable movie. the ending is both very sad,and depressing. it's a movie i wanna see again. it makes you think about life,and what you have around you. it's a movie that i think can grow on me,and make me like it even more than i already do. it's all in all a memorable movie. i give american beauty *** out of ****",Null,0,0,1 October 1999
BASEketball," one of the funniest movies of 1998!
","BASEketball is very funny. david zucker pulls out all the stops here, not his funniest but in his top 5 maybe. the funniest gags are where trey parker is riding down the highway, and a very strange song comes on the radio. that was rolling on the floor funny. the other best gag is the unsolved mysteries reports with robert stack. i give this movie *** out of ****",Null,1,3,11 April 1999

The Exorcist," pretty good horror movie
","the exorcist is a pretty good horror movie. i first sawthis movie around 1990 or maybe a little after. the firsthalf of this movie so slow it's about the same as watchingthe grass grow outside,however this movie is really goodin the second half. by the time you find out something iswrong with the girl it kicks into gear. but the movie isnot one bit scary if i watch it in the day time,i have towatch it at night with the lights out to be scared. myrating would be higher if the first half would've beenlike the second half. all in all the first half is a bore,but the second half is really good. i give the exorcist **1/2 out of ****",Null,1,1,12 August 1999

Empire Records," a 90 minute music video
","a great cast is pretty much wasted in this 90 minute music video.good music is just about the only thing good about this movie.i love teen movies.but you need more than just great music in a teen movie.the soundtrack is really good,but far from being the best ever.this movie was all in all ok.but empire records is just another teen movie in the 90's trying to be as good as a lot of 80's teen movies.but there are some in the 90's that are as good as some in the 80's.empire records is not one of them.it's another breakfast club wannabe.i give empire records ** out of ****",Null,0,2,5 May 1999

The Evil Dead," very scary
","this movie is very scary. but not as good all-around as alot of people say. but it's still better than the unfunny,and way overrated evil dead 2. i still haven'tseen the 3rd one yet,and i doubt i will because i've heardit continues from the ending of part 2. the ending of part2 was one of the worst ending in history. all in all theoriginal evil dead is very scary,and has gore galore,but stilldoesn't have anything more than that. i give the evil dead**1/2 out of ****",Null,1,2,29 July 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," good vampire movie!

Major League," The funniest in the series!

There's Something About Mary," more points about this movie
","like i said before there's something about mary is very funny. some scenes are very funny other scenes are just funny. but it was a bit overrated. the movie was good but could've even been better if i would've cared for the characters. the characters in this movie are cut out of cardboard boxes. 1 dimensional to the max. but the big laughs make up for the poorly drawn-out characters. and this movie is entertaining most of the time. i laughed more in dirty work than in this movie. but there's something about mary is still in the top 5 of the funniest movies of 98. the people overrated this movie by saying it's the funniest movie in years. i can name countless movies that are funnier than this. the jokes in there's something about mary get kind of old after the 3rd or 4th viewing. the jokes in movies like the naked gun,hot shots,dirty work,and king pin never really get too old for me. but like i said there's something about mary is in the top 5 of the funniest movies of 98. just a bit overrated. i give there's something about mary *** out of ****",Null,0,0,11 June 1999

A Clockwork Orange," one strange movie
","this is one strange movie. it's one of those movies that'sstrange,but not disturbing. the movie could've been disturbing if they would've played more haunting music,instead of that out of place opera music. the movieis full of sex,and violence without a interesting storybehind it. but in parts this movie was semi-interesting.it's extremely overrated,but i guess some people were able to like it somehow. for  me almost nothing in this movie is entertaining. just a lot of sex,and violence without a bit of a interesting story behind it. but like i said in parts it was semi-interesting. i give a clockwork orange ** out of ****",Null,2,4,13 October 1999
Pulp Fiction," a little overrated,but still not bad
","pulp fiction is a little overrated,but still not bad. the movie doesn't have much of a point,that's why it doesn't live up to the hype it got. but a lot of dialogue in this movie is really good. samuel L. jackson's mind-blowing dialogue is the best thing about this movie. if there was a real plot it could've been better. jackson's dialogue is the only thing that resembles any of the hype this movie got. other characters are pretty good too,but in my opinion jackson owned the movie. i give pulp fiction **1/2 out of ****",Null,0,2,8 October 1999

Scream 2," more points about this movie
","i still think scream 2 is better than scream. first off the new characters in scream 2 are not as annoying as some in the first movie,and the death scenes are bigger,and better than the first one. the only thing about scream thats better than scream 2 is the ending. the ending isn't a lot better,just a bit better. but the rest of scream in my opinion kind of pales in comparsion to scream 2. i just watch both of the movies,and when i watch them,im just simply more entertained by scream 2 than the first one. another thing for the past 2 years the first scream has been highly overrated by the media,and other people. the first scream is a good movie,but it's just not as good as the media makes it out it be. it's not the best horror movie ever made. in my opinion there was not another movie in 1997 that was as entertaining as scream 2. i also think scream 2 is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever. but it isn't that scary. but it knows how to be an extremely entertaining horror movie without being that scary. im not one of those people that thinks theres hardly ever a good sequel that comes out. i think there are more than a few sequels out there that are just as good as the first one,and a lot of times better. however there are more original movies out there that are better than it's sequels. im just pointing out sequels are not nearly as bad as a lot of people say. i give scream 2 ***1/2 out of ****",9,0,1,6 July 1999

","i love the breakfast club.it's hard to believe the first time i saw the breakfast club was only in 1995.it's a classic in my mind.it's one of my favorite movies of all time! and a tie between another movie for my favorite movie of all time.i first saw the edited tv version in 1995.it was great then i bought the movie the day after christmas in 1997.it was better than the tv version as you should know.it's a masterpiece in my mind.it's the best teen movie i have even seen in my life! everything that everyone says in this movie is masterful.everytime i watch it i feel like i'm in detention with them.the breakfast club is about five teenagers that are a brain,a jock,a basketcase,a criminal,and a princess that spend a saturday in detention for various reasons.everything that comes out of everyone's mouth in this movie is masterful.but not everything that comes out of mr. vernon's mouth is masterful.but everyone's else is.even everything the janitor says is masterful.it's sometimes funny is always entertaining.john bender (judd nelson) steals every scene.in my opinion he had the best performance of the whole cast.but the rest of the cast was great also.the breakfast club is an unforgettable masterpiece.it just gets better,and better every time i see it.it was co-produced wrote,and directed by the king,and master of teen,and feel-good movies john hughes.the five teenagers in this movie talk about themselves,and each other the whole time there in detention.it's the best movie made by john hughes.the best music,and movies came out of my favorite decade the 80's.i love the 80's.i wish i was a teenager in 1985.being the same age i am now 17.my favorite part in the breakfast club is the whole movie.but one part stands as the best.which is the end when all five teens are all sitting around a table in detention.talking about themselves,and each other.that was the most touching,and most real part part of the movie.everything they said was so touching,and so real.THANKS JOHN HUGHES FOR GIVING US THIS MASTERPIECE CALLED THE BREAKFAST CLUB.you can relate to this movie so much.i love this movie,and i always will.i give this masterpiece called the breakfast club **** out of ****",10,0,1,26 April 1999
The Breakfast Club," one of the best if not (the) best movie I have ever seen!
","The Breakfast Club is so great I don't even know my name. The people in this movie you can relate to so much it's like you're in detention with them. The first time I saw this movie was in 1995. It was great. Then I bought the movie in 1997. The more I watch it the more I like it. I think John Bender is the best character in this movie, played by Judd Nelson. Second was a tie between Andy and Brian played by Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall, but every character was great -even the janitor was great, and Paul Gleason playing Mr. Vernen was good too. Like someone else said I wish I was in 1985 as my age now. Nothing would be more cooler than that. I give this masterpeace **** out of ****",10,0,1,18 March 1999
The Wedding Singer," pretty good 80's nostalgia movie
","i love the premise for this movie. the premise for this movie is better than any other adam sandler premise. but what this movie lacks is pacing. other adam sandler movies were well paced. but the wedding singer is still entertaining sometimes,and funny. i love the fact that it's set in 1985. but this movie could've been a lot better with the premise that it had. but it's still all in all not bad. i give the wedding singer **1/2 out of ****",Null,1,1,19 August 1999
Back to the Future," The best in the series, and one of the best feel-good movies of all time!
","I love this movie. It's hard to believe the first time I saw this movie was only 3 and a half or 4 years ago. I always heard of it, just never watched it. I saw part II before this one in 1990. Back to the Future kept growing on me after seeing it 3 and a half or 4 years ago. It grew to the point that I loved it, and I think it's one of the best feel-good movies of all time! I give Back to the Future ***1/2 out of ****",Null,1,2,25 April 1999
Evil Dead II," this movie was a little too goofy for me
",the humor in this movie doesn't work that much for me. it's not nearly as good as the people on here say. it's not as good as the first one. the second depends on humor more than scares like in the first one. but the thing is the humor isn't that funny in evil dead II. in fact it's almost never funny. but there are a few interesting things in evil dead II that make it semi-ok.i give it ** out of ****,Null,1,3,10 May 1999
