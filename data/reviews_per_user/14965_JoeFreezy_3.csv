Ali," Good Actors + Good Director = Really Bad Movie
","First things first, there was no way this movie could've been good.  How could you make a movie about the life of arguably the greatest and most influential athlete of the 20th century, choosing to do only a certain 10-year period of it, and squeeze it comfortably in two hours?  Well, you can't.  (And it was closer to three hours.)  What this movie doesn't do is tell its audience what made Muhammad Ali great, or what made him influential.  It doesn't dig into his mind to try and explain his charisma or cockiness.  (If you want to know anything about Muhammad Ali, go watch one of those A&E documentaries.)  What we are left with is a few of his fights with some so-called plot sandwiched in between.But enough with the bashing.  Let's give some credit where credit is due.Acting.This was to be the movie that made Will Smith great.  He was supposed to win the 2002 Academy Award for Best Actor in a landslide.  And believe me, Will Smith did not disappoint.  Along with he 30-35 lbs of muscle he added on to look the part, he definitely talked the part as well, though the dullness of the movie will probably cost him his Oscar.  Jamie Foxx as Ali's sidekick and corner-man Drew `Bundini' Brown brought some much needed comic relief to the movie.  Foxx's oversized belly and thinning hair made his role that much more believable.  But arguably the best acting performance was done by Jon Voight portraying sports analyst Howard Cossell.  His makeup and voice brought audiences back to the days of ABC's Wide World of Sports with stunning accuracy.Direction and photography.Not often could a bad movie be the result of a director who did his job fairly well.  The movie lagged extremely.  But the fight scenes were probably one of the best caught on film.  What satisfied me the most was its realism.  (I guess this would be a spoiler if you've never seen an Ali fight.) The lasting images of Ali standing over Sonny Liston in Ali-Liston II, Frazier knocking down Ali in there first bout, and George Foreman twirling around the ring before collapsing flat on his back, out of breath were just the way I remembered them.  Too bad the fight scenes were the only things in the movie worth watching.If I were to cite the things in this movie that could've been improved, we may be here for a while.  So I'll just say that the Will Smith, Jon Voight, Jamie Foxx, and Michael Mann couldn't save this movie from failing before it even started.  But they did do their best.My score for this movie - 3/10.",3,0,0,3 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Fun-Filled & Action-Packed, But Lacking That Star Wars Magic
","Why are the critics bashing this movie?  If critics, like Chicago's Roger Ebert for example, can give good reviews to a movie based on its `popcorn value,' why can't they do the same for `Clones.'  This was arguably the most entertaining and the most fun of the Star Wars movies.  All moviegoers, fans or not, will enjoy this movie.  (Yoda alone is worth the price of admission.)  But the praise ends here. Anyone can argue which of the original trilogy is the best.  Mine personally is `Jedi' for the simple fact that everything came full circle. One can argue for `Empire' for its plot twist.  One can argue for `Hope' for a variety of reasons.  Any and all of these reasons are correct.  The original trilogy had that `Star Wars Magic.'  `Clones' unfortunately does not. After the travesty that was `Phantom Menace,' I was rather pleased by George Lucas' second offering.  This movie contains wall-to-wall action that is unheard of in a Star Wars movie.  That would be all, though, that fans will remember of this movie.  It's an action movie with a Star Wars theme, instead of a Star Wars movie with action.  It just didn't have that `Star Wars Magic.' I could still, though, watch this movie over and over again. - 7/10",7,0,0,16 May 2002
Blow," 1st of many good movies this year
","I'd have to admit that I had no desire to watch this movie.  I just went to watch it because everyone said it was good.  I must say that I was astonished.  This movie will almost certainly bring serious Oscar consideration for Johnny Depp, Ray Liotta, Best Cinematography, and maybe even Best Director, pending the releases of movies still to come.I have gained a newfound respect for Johnny Depp.  This movie does a lot to help erase the images in people's minds of Depp starring in Benny & Joon and Edward Scissorhands.  He's always been a good actor, but now he has a movie like this to add to his resume.Ray Liotta surprised me a lot in this movie.  The role that personifies him will always be his role in GoodFellas.  In this movie, he plays a caring, loving, and very understanding, father.  But what really caught me off guard is that the played this role perfectly.The only problem I have with this movie is its length.  Usually with great movies, you're enjoying it so much the first time you see it that you don't even notice that your approaching 2 hrs and 30 min.  This movie, while it was excellent, is a movie in which you would notice how long it is.Many people compare this movie to Traffic.  I guess because of it's subject matter.  I not the biggest fan of Traffic, and would rate Blow way above it. I found Traffic to be a little too documentary-like, while Blow is a 'movie' that you just have to watch.This is an excellent movie all the way through, including the unexpected and very sad ending.  My rating - 9.",9,0,0,22 April 2001
