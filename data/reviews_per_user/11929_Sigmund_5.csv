Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Futile exhibition of FX
","I know that cinema is no longer to be considered Art, but just Entertainment... Nevertheless, I was disappointed by this movie. The plot was weak and predictable, with so many holes you could spend hours enumerating them (I'll just point one: why the hell the wise Jedi knight takes a kid with him while assaulting the castle????). The characters, even if well acted, were flat. Think about the dark charm of Darth Vader, and compare with this meaningless Darth Maul... he doesn't even speak. Is he kind of an idiot??Just to cut short, if you are a kid, you might enjoy this movie a bit. If you are a computer animation tech, you will find this VERY interesting. If you are a serious movie goer you will yawn. And lately, if you are a fan of the real STAR WARS movies, you will feel very sad.",6,0,1,7 May 2000
Sleepy Hollow," Great settling, but...
","REALLY excellent gothic gloomy settling, maybe the best ever seen. It is all OK, except one thing: the plot was clearly too heavy, and they had to cut some corners to get to the end. So a few things are overlooked (Ricci and Depp, for instance, they didn't even speak and they are in love!!) And finally, they couldn't save the movie from being a BIT boring near the end.",7,0,0,21 December 2000
Fargo," Not that good... sorry.
","I expected more from Fargo. Shortly said, the brothers wanted to be original, and ended up being too original. I gave it a 6 anyway, because it was yet interesting, in particular for dialogues and characters. There was an eerie atmosphere, too. But the balance between noir and comedy resulted in a tie, with no spectaculars... Of course a movie may have a complex order, but it always needs an order. Here we see scenes that don't have a direction, every one going its own way. It looks like a collection of random shots. As for humor, there are some hilarious lines, but I really mean 'some'.I understand somebody may appreciate it more than me and give it a 7, but anything above is pure overrating.In conclusion, if you've heard about Fargo and hope to find that particular humor in it, you'd better see 'The Big Lebowsky'.",6,1,2,26 July 1999
The Battle of Algiers," Excellent movie
","I ask myself why we never see these kind of movies on TV, instead of airing again and again the same old lethal weapons, jurassic parks, and other similar stuff? This is real cinema, this is why it is considered a form of art!With the metaphysical crudeness of black and white, the dramatical facts of the Algerian rebellion against the French are accounted. The movie has the realistic appearance of a chronicle. And there are tons of intellectual honesty, too. I mean that there are no white hats VS black hats. You can see terrorists troubled as they are about to leave a bomb in a cafe. Policemen who struggle to save an arabian child from being killed by outraged crowd. Most of all, I like the frank words of Colonel Mathieu about the 'bad methods' he's using during interrogations... Watch the movie and you will know.",8,81,95,11 August 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Frankly a bore
","Since the first scene I realized that I had made a bad mistake, then I had 2 hours to regret it. Let me start from what is good in this movie: the fighting scenes (even if too prolonged); the gorgeous natural scenery, in particular the forests; NOTHING ELSE! The charaters are bidimensional stereotypes, the plot is weak and not enticing. Maybe this was meant to be a kind of Fairy tale, but I'm an ADULT! My friend was watching it with me, but his chair was too comfortable, so he fell asleep within 30 minutes yawning 'are they still craving up the buildings?'. My chair was harder so I kept watching, alas!To be avoided, except for Wu Shu fanatics.",3,1,2,6 October 2001
