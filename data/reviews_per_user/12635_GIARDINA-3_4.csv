Requiem for a Dream," Ellen Burstyn in one of the best performances ever by an American actress
","I have finally had the chance to watch this movie and although its flaws, mostly due to its unnecessary 'modern' style, it is a movie based on its actors' performances. Ellen Burstyn is nothing short of magnificent - this must be one of the best performances by an American actress in movie history. The last part of the movie, when Ellen almost dominates the screen, is unforgettable. I wonder how an actress can accomplish what Ms. Burstyn did in this movie. I have paid a lot of attention to Ellen Burstyn over these years and I am glad she is still around offering us her brilliance. Bravo Ms. Burstyn!",10,0,0,24 May 2001
Erin Brockovich," A star vehicle for Julia Roberts.
","Even though this movie lacks some dramatic punch, it is extremely effective as a star vehicle for Julia Roberts. She is indeed perfect as Erin Brockovich. It is a very mature role and she handles it beautifully. After playing some bombs, like 'Runaway Bride' and 'Notting Hill', Julia Roberts finally makes us remind of her great performances in 'Pretty Woman' and 'Steel Magnolias'. I can see Academy Award nominations for her and Albert Finney, who, along with Roberts, is excellent.",Null,1,1,15 May 2000
Fight Club," A complete waste of time
","This movie tries to pass itself as an art movie but it never is. When 'Pulp Fiction', for example, was a very clever film, in spite of being a violent one, 'Fight Club' is only annoying and sometimes boring. Edward Norton, though, is superb, as always, and he is the only reason why I did not turned my VCR off. It is quite surprising how well he can act - he is truly the best American young actor of our time.",Null,0,1,24 July 2000
Billy Elliot," A wonderful experience
","This movie is truly a little gem. The brilliant performance by Jamie Bell, who should have been nominated for an Oscar, completes it all. Julie Walters was also superb and the direction was effective all of the time. A must see movie for everyone!",Null,0,0,16 April 2001
