Requiem for a Dream," Smashing
","I really loved this movie. Some friends of mine told me I really had to watch this one, and this advice happened to be right. Requiem for a Dream, and especially its music, gave me goose bumps, which is quite rare in my case. I believe that the actors did a great job; Ellen Burstyn wasn't given an Oscar nomination because of her poor acting skills, was she? Besides, Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly show the world that they are promising actors. A big step towards a great career!The story of this movie was very stirring, which caused me to get absorbed in the film. I also found myself empathizing with the main characters, which is something that doesn't happen frequently when I'm watching a movie. The absolutely shocking and unusual end of Requiem for a Dream kept echoing in my mind for a long time, and I suppose that this smashing final makes this movie such a high point.",9,0,1,28 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Soporific
","I really thought this movie was a smashing one, given the fact that it created a hype in Holland and the reviews really praised the film. Unfortunately, I found myself sleeping in the cinema. I should have known that this would happen, because I really disliked the first movie, which I believe is called 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. And guess what, I'm going to watch the final chapter of this trilogy, too! It is to be hoped that I won't fall asleep...",6,1,2,28 December 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," Great.
","Really, this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.The acting skills are great (oh, I wish I were capable to act like Anthony Hopkins!), the locations are beautiful and realistic (even Buffalo Bill's dungeon looks like it really exists), the music is absolutely stirring and the story sticks to that in the novel... Great!",10,0,0,28 December 2003
