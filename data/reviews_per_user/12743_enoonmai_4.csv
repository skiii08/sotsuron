Ali," Mission: Impossible?
","Although this film was too long, it missed out the beginning and end of the Ali story. The omission of Clay being refused service in a diner upon his return from the Olympics and the 'Thrilla in Manila' leave huge holes in the make-up of the man and icon that is Muhammad Ali.The fight scenes are superbly choreographed using real boxers and this is part of another problem with the film  is it a documentary or a movie?. As a boxing fan, I had difficulty believing that his opponents were who they were supposed to be - Joe Frazier was James Toney with an afro wig and never had me believing that he was Joe Frazier.Overall, this film dealt well with Ali's womanising and relationship with 'Bundini' Brown and Howard Cosell but was superficial and left me unfulfilled. Maybe this was mission impossible but the movie set out ambitious targets and missed most of them. You are better off getting a video of Ali's fights, watching 'When We Were Kings' and reading his biography by Thomas Hauser.",6,16,35,25 October 2004
Sleepy Hollow," Disappointing
","I am not a fan of Tim Burton movies, but watched this anyway.  Perhaps I missed the point but maybe this should've been called 'Scooby Doo and The Headless Horseman'!  Whoever thinks this is a horror is clearly missing something and has not seen any bona fide horror movies such as The Exorcist, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Night of the Living Dead or Psycho.  I thought the film was stupid, but decent performances from Christina Ricci, Richard Griffiths and Christopher Lee give it some credence.  If you like Tim Burton, watch this movie, if not - give it a miss and watch a proper horror film or an episode of 'Scooby Doo'.",8,1,2,19 June 2002
The Number 23," Dreadful, taking itself far too seriously.
","I'd guessed the trick ending before I even got to the cinema just from watching the trailer, but after they'd exhausted the mathematical computations of 23 in the first half hour, the film just completely lost it's way en route to a predictable and contrived ending. Just because Caesar was stabbed 23 times and Shakespeare was born and died on April 23rd doesn't give the number significance  they may as well have said that Michael Jordan played his whole career in the number 23 shirt and because 2 divided by 3 is 0.666, Michael is the anti-Christ!It was sad to see Virginia Madsen, who was so good in Candyman and Sideways working with such lumpen material but Jim Carrey is just dreadful, putting in a performance that is even worse than in the 'Ace Ventura' movies  something I didn't think was humanly possible.This isn't big or clever, it's not serious cinema and it's not worthy of your admission money.",1,10,20,4 March 2007
The Descent," Brilliantly tense from start to finish
","With Dog Soldiers, Neil Marshall created a tight and claustrophobic atmosphere then added the scares to create a very good horror film. However, the tension was often released with humour and the audience were allowed to catch their breath and relax. At no point in The Descent are you allowed to relax as Marshall grabs your attention within the first few minutes and doesn't let go until the credits roll at the end.With the film set almost entirely underground, the lack of light is used to wonderful effect and Marshall keeps you on edge for 100 minutes; if you liked Dog Soldiers, 28 Days Later and/or Haute Tension and are sick of the formulaic rubbish being pumped out of Hollywood then The Descent is likely to be right up your street.",10,377,540,9 July 2005
