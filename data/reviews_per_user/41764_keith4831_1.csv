Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Easily the best movie I have seen in a long time.
","If we look at Kill Bill as a whole, I think it is easy to see why QT is placed amoung the top directors in America.  Vol.2 picks up where the last one left off, with The Bride on her 'roaring rampage of revenge.'I have seen better acting in Vol. 2 alone then most other movies I have seen in the past few years.  The character development is among the best of the best.  The movie could not have been done any better.My faviorate movie has alwasys been Pulp Fiction, but if I could take Kill Bill as a whole movie, it would top my list.I highly recommend anyone to as least give this movie a try, with an open mind.",10,0,1,18 April 2004
