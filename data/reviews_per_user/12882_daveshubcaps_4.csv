The Ring," One of the creepiest films ever!
","This has to be one of the creepiest films I have ever seen! Verbinski manages to set the perfect mood for this movie. From disturbing imagery (especially that tape!), to the inspired choice of Seattle, Washington as the location (it gave the movie a murky grayish quality).This is a movie you need to pay attention to though, otherwise you will miss many of the answers to questions asked. Even those questions don't always get completely answered, I suppose that makes for good sequel material. Casting was quite good, especially the kid, Aidan. Reminding me a bit of Rory Culkin, he had that bug-eyed look that let you know that something is just not quite right!Overall, if you're looking for something to really creep you out, and you don't mind some loose ends, the Ring is a good choice.7/10P.S.: I found an easter egg on the DVD. On the main menu, keep pressing the up button until the red arrow indicator disappears, then press play. This egg uses surround sound systems to full effect, especailly at the end!",7,1,1,24 March 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," The best thing I can say: It Didn't Suck!
","I know that most of us went into the theater with this silent prayer in our minds: 'Please don't suck! PLEASE dont SUCK! PLEASE DON'T SUCK!'First, the good news: It didn't SUCK!Now, the not so good news: It wasn't great either.The best I can do for this movie is say it was pretty good. If it were a stand alone movie, that would be enough. But since it follows two of the best sci-fi movies ever made, it's a bit of a letdown, but not much.This movie is certainly worth watching in the theaters, if for nothing else than the action sequences. Of which there are some doozies! The chase scene with the crane alone is worth the price of admission!The acting in this movie was well done. Being an action flick, I'm not looking for Oscar worthy performances, but I did start to care about these people. Kristanna Lokken did quite well as the T-X, her performance as such rivals that of Robert Patrick as the T-1000 in T2, and she has a nice butt to boot! Nick Stahl fills in quite well as John Connor, though I still would rather have seen Edward Furlong reprise his role and give the film more of a connection to its predecessors. Claire Danes works well too, though her part seems a bit like a redux of Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor from the first film, even to the point where John Connor says to her in a scene, 'You remind me of my mother!'.Then of course there's Ah-nuld! what can I say? The man was born to play this part! The only problem I had with this rendition of the T-800 (or T-101 in this film) was that for the first 2/3 of the movie, the script relies so heavily on the amusing one-liners (in their defense, they ARE funny!)that the movie threatens to become a parody of itself.Jonathon Mostow does a good job directing, but I really would have liked to have seen what Cameron would have done with this movie. His absence I think is what stops this movie from being great.The biggest gripe I have with this movie is its ending. While it does set up a possible T4 movie, it is anti-climatic to say the least, and furthermore in contradiction to the theme of T2.I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",7,0,0,5 July 2003
The Transporter," Pure action, and not much else!
","This is a nice pickup if you need to scratch that action fix. Jason Statham kicks butt with the best of them! Watch in particular for the action scene in the garage where he firghts a dozen men on a floor covered in engine oil!Open the popcorn bag, shut your mind off, and enjoy the ride!7/10",7,0,0,13 July 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," I'm going to have to see this again!
","This movie had to be about the most anticipated sequel in my life, right up there with Empire Strikes Back. So, I was a little worried when I started hearing some not so great things about this movie. I went in the theater with a little trepidation.I came out knowing I'd have to see this movie again, and soon!Let me just say that the talk about how slow the first hour is and all the philisophical mumbo-jumbo had me worried that someone had taken Wakng Life and made it into an action flick! And while the first hour is a bit tedious, and philosophy is certainly discussed, it was nowhere near as bad as the critics said! And once the 100 Agent Smiths fight comes around, this movie kicks in to full bad-ass gear and delivers the goods til the end!
Now, I can't say it was as good as the first movie (nothing is ever like your first time!), mainly because this movie takes a different path, one which I didn't quite count on, and which will require viewing the Third movie in six months. Thank god I don't have to wait longer! Meantime, I'll be heading back to the theater soon to se this again, and pick up what I missed!Well worth seeing! 8/10",8,0,0,16 May 2003
