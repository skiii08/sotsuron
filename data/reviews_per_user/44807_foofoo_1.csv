Antz," Definitely not for children
","I was very disappointed in this film.  It was advertised as a children's movie but was so riddled with profanity and references to adult matter that it was completely inappropriate for any child under age 13.  Spielberg seems to always have some message to send through his films, so I wonder what message he's trying to send here.  This is the last Dreamworks film I'll ever watch.",Null,0,1,11 October 1998
