Minority Report," Should have been much better...
","This was an enjoyable movie, but ultimately disappointing because it should have been a truly memorable film.Steven Spielberg should simply steer clear of any story that contains the slightest element of film noir.  His directing style is completely unsuited to this type of project.  This movie careens wildly between noir imagery and heartstring-tugging sentimentalism, between stylish action sequences and bubble-gum.  It never builds any lasting tension.  It never takes the time to revel in its glorious futurish sets.  The camera rarely steps back from its claustrophobic POV to give us a sense of atmosphere.  Spielberg is always more interested in pushing his viewers' emotional buttons than in creating a coherent work of art.  This impulse serves him well when making family-oriented movies, but it has haunted him in his recent efforts to make serious adult-minded films.To the extent that 'Minority Report' succeeds in engaging us, it owes a great debt to its source material.  Phillip K. Dick's short story, upon which the movie is based, was one of his classic brain-teasers.  In the future, murders can be predicted in advance and prevented... but only if people are willing to cede many cherished safeguards of freedom to a creepily totalitarian government agency.  It's a thought-provoking concept that the movie fleshes out fairly nicely... until a completely unnecessary and haphazardly tacked-on ending sequence opens up mile-wide plot holes and dilutes the impact of Dick's message.This film worked best when it stepped away from its narrow storyline and engaged us with its its vision of 2053 America.  The billboards which scan people's retinas and deliver individually-tailored ad pitches were a nice Orwellian touch.  The oddball side characters (especially Peter Stormare as a creepy black-market eye surgeon) lent a unique character to the movie. The cyberpunkish set design was generally quite good.  Unfortunately, the strengths of 'Minority Report' were consistently undercut by its uneven direction and the weaknesses in the script.This is what happens when a good film gets Spielberged.
I think most people will enjoy this movie, just don't set your expectations too high.  And don't think too hard about how much better it could have been in the hands of a truly edgy and daring filmmaker.",7,9,15,13 January 2003
Chinatown," One of the very best...
","'Chinatown' is the sort of film which could only have been made in the early 1970s--after the veil of censorship was lifted, allowing filmmakers to explore the dark, gritty side of life and address controversial topics, but before the major studios completely lost their old-fashioned class and style.  It is the link between the classic film-noir of the 1940s and the recent renaissance in the genre that has produced films like 'L.A. Confidential'.  It's also a damn good movie... one of my all-time favorites.
Jack Nicholson is fantastic as Jake, the anti-hero gumshoe with a checkered past, who uncovers a dark conspiracy.  Faye Dunaway also gives a solid performance in a very complex role, and John Huston plays a wonderfully malevolent villain.  Director Roman Polanski brilliantly captures the atmosphere of 1930s LA, with its stark contrasts: sunshine and dark underworlds, personal freedom and powerful corrupt elites, beautiful people and ugly secrets.  The plot twists and turns wildly but not implausibly.  We follow Jake as he puts together a very complicated puzzle and runs afoul of the wrong people.  The action builds in a crescendo to one of the most unexpected and memorable endings in cinematic history.It's no coincidence that this movie came out in 1974, the year in which the long and sordid Watergate scandal brought down a corrupt and dangerous President.  'Chinatown' reflects the mood of the times--the men in power are amoral and self-serving, the police are part of the problem, an individual has little chance against the system.  Yet, with its setting in the fondly-remembered past, 'Chinatown' clearly carries the message that the American Dream has always had an ugly side...  the happy ending has always been a hollow lie.  Both groundbreaking and timeless, this is one of the truly great films.",10,2,5,26 June 2000
Meet the Parents," Just a good old-fashioned comedy
","Once upon a time, comedy writers sought to create humor through plot and character development, rather than merely packing the script with crude sight gags and one-liners.  'Meet the Parents' is a long-overdue renaissance of this lost art form.  While most modern comedy films are all punch lines and no joke, this one earns its laughs the old-fashioned way--building comedic situations and using its one-liners as mere icing on the cake.  As a result, 'Meet the Parents' bears more resemblance to 'Some Like it Hot' than it does to 'There's Something About Mary'.Having recently been married myself, (inheriting a stern set of in-laws) I found myself identifying strongly with the ill-fated Ben Stiller character. The increasingly complicated situations in which he becomes ensnared were physically stressful to watch.  The father (Robert DeNiro) is demanding and intrusive.  The girlfriend (Teri Polo) is too self-absorbed to notice how badly things are going.  The hapless suitor makes increasingly boneheaded decisions in a desperate effort to curry favor.  We've all been there.  We see ourselves in the characters, and we're forced to laugh at the sheer absurdity of it all. The acting is solid, the script is as tightly wound as a good episode of 'Seinfeld', and the laughs are abundant.  You can't ask much more than that from a comedy.",8,0,0,4 January 2001
Fight Club," Am I the only one who caught the humor?
","Quite a lot has been written about this film, both good and bad, and I can't help feeling that most people took it too seriously to notice how extremely funny it is.'Fight Club' is a wickedly hilarious satire that skewers every aspect of post-industrial society.  From 12-step programs to the aggression-therapy men's movement, from conspicuous consumerism to black-clad anarchists, from Freud to Nietzsche to New Age psychology... you get the idea.  The dialogue is packed with memorable and funny lines.  Pitt and Norton had several humorous asides, and Norton performed a little bit of brilliant slapstick. This had me laughing more than most movies which are marketed as comedies.Many movies have poked fun at the yuppie lifestyle (few as brilliantly and thoroughly) but here we are not presented with politically correct good guys like we were in 'American Beauty'.  The satire in 'Fight Club' spares no one.  As Tyler Durden says, we don't have a great war or a great depression in this generation.  The loss of our individuality to the corporate lifestyle is THE big issue in civilization today, and few movies have made the case as convincingly, or as humorously, as this one.Some have commented that 'Fight Club' glorifies violence and male aggression.  I disagree completely.  Yes, the movie mocks the demasculation of men in today's world.  But the men of Fight Club are shown to be sado-masochistic thugs, conformists with fascist tendencies, mindless followers, latent homosexuals, and ultimately insane... Hardly a ringing endorsement.  Tyler Durden is an appealing anti-hero, but he's also stark raving mad and extremely manipulative.  This does not glorify violence... it shows how people are driven to violence.(Minor spoilers ahead...)I didn't care much for the ending, but not for the reasons which have often been cited.  Who cares if it's implausible?  The entire movie is unrealistic if taken literally (Bombs from soap?)  Everything is exaggerated and distorted.  But the ending puts the focus on the psychology of an individual, rather than on sociology-- power and violence-- which is where David Fincher had the most interesting things to say.  It also opens the door for not-so-bright folks to get the impression that Fincher wants them to go out and start a revolution, which I seriously doubt.Overall, however, a very good movie.  Don't take it so seriously that you miss all the fun.",8,0,1,18 July 2000
Memento," Just enjoy the movie!
","'Memento' is not really one of the ten greatest films of all time, but that's hardly an insult.  It's a very intelligent, stylish neo-noir film with a creative concept and solid execution.  The concept is actually quite simple, but effective-- the backward narrative allows us to slowly uncover the mysterious beginning.  And, much like the protagonist, we are never actually certain what is really going on.  'Memento' isn't as complex and innovative as some would have you believe, but it certainly deserves its hype more than, say, 'Being John Malkovich'.  The brilliance of the film actually lies in how beautifully and thoroughly the narrative conveys the basic theme-- memory is subjective.  We all make sense of our lives through little mementoes and fragments of memories, believing in whatever stories we have told ourselves to give meaning to those memories... stories which may be completely inaccurate.  Lenny is just an extreme case of a condition that we all experience.***Mild spoilers***The ending of the film only furthers this notion.  Some reviewers have complained about plot holes, and the uncertainty over whether the background story told by Teddy near the end is accurate.  And yet this is precisely the point.  All memories have gaps.  All events in real life have plot holes to those who experience them-- we don't have access to a narrator providing explanatory voice-overs.  And all of us center our lives around a set of questionable assumptions.  Does it really matter if Lenny got the right guy... or if his wife was really murdered... or if Sammy really existed?  Of course not. All that matters, and all that you ultimately have, are a few little crumbs of hard evidence and your own interpretation. 
And that, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is the way life works.",9,0,1,12 December 2001
X-Men," Smart, stylish, and very cool
","'X-Men' is a rare treat-- a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the mark.Along with Tim Burton's 'Batman', this stands head and shoulders above all other superhero movies.  It's a genre that's usually synonymous with silly, campy, cartoonish crap, but Bryan Singer delivers a long-awaited exception to the rule.  'X-Men' is smart, stylish, and very cool... one of the better sci fi/fantasy films of the last decade.Of course, it helps to have good source material.The X-Men comics, which originated in the 1960s, are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as 'Superman' where the heroes are always right, and truth, justice, and the American Way always prevail.  The series is a well-crafted parable about individuality and discrimination.  The characters are mutants--struggling to find a place in a society that rejects them.  Its primary villain, Magneto, isn't an evil lunatic-- he's a sympathetic character, a misguided revolutionary playing Huey Newton to Professor Xavier's Martin Luther King. The iconic character, Wolverine, is a beer-swilling anti-hero who cares little for ideals and fights only to protect himself and his loved ones. The female characters are as powerful and important as the men, rather than being mere love interests.Rather than making just another flashy explosion-per-minute-special-effects-extravaganza, Singer practices the lost arts of character and plot development.  As a result, the movie has a far greater depth than the average big budget summer flick.  The acting is also quite good on the whole.  Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, is fantastic--a bona fide Clint Eastwood caliber badass.  Some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy, but in the hands of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart it sounds quite convincing.  (Stewart has made a career out of making lame dialogue sound cool.)Hard-core fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular X-Men.  This is silly.   A movie that gave the background on every character in the comic books would be 6 hours long.  There will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels.  Fans have also complained about the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue.   I disagree.  Rogue is unable to touch another human being without harming them--she would not realistically act like a confident, sassy warrior.  Paquin did a tremendous job of conveying the fear and isolation that such a young woman would feel. She will undoubtedly grow into the part in future movies.In the end, 'X-Men' is a comic book movie.  Superpowers are explained with silly pseudoscientific babble, the plot revolves around a fairly ridiculous take-over-the-world scheme, and names like 'Magneto' are spoken with a straight face.  Don't read all the glowing reviews and expect Citizen Kane. But don't underestimate 'X-Men' either.  It is an intelligent movie that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the comic.",8,161,191,16 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lowered Expectations Save the Day
","After the disappointing Episode One, and reading so many bitterly negative reviews here at IMDB, I went into 'Attack of the Clones' expecting to see a lame movie... and I was pleasantly surprised.This one ain't bad!(...but it's not all that great)There is much to enjoy about this flick.  The series returns to its old atmosphere of lively action sequences, bizarre alien creatures, seedy bars full of lowlife scum, wisecracking heroes, and mythic duels between good and evil.  The love scenes and political intrigue aren't nearly as long and boring as I was led to believe they would be.  The goofy slapstick and lame pseudoscience of The Phantom Menace have all but disappeared. By and large, this FEELS LIKE a Star Wars movie.  Sure, the symbolism is heavy-handed and the plot devices are wildly implausible.  But the Star Wars series has never been anything more, or less, than B-movie space operas for kids with inflated special-effects budgets.  That's why we love them.But, as with Episode One, we are forced to wonder just how much better this movie could have been had Lucas hired a good director, and allowed his script to be edited by professionals.  Christopher and Portman are forced to act stiff and unnatural, and recite some of the lamest dialogue ever written.  Samuel L. Jackson is wasted except for his battle scene.  As in so many recent CGI-heavy action movies, the pacing is too fast and the camera changes are too abrupt to get a clear sense of the action.  But on the plus side, Ewan McGregor has grown gracefully into his role as Obi Wan, and he almost single-handedly makes the story work.Lucas has stated that current technology has now allowed him to make the movies he always wanted to make... but I can't help feeling that he made better movies when he was restricted by the laws of nature and forced to creatively improvise special effects.  Now he just jam-packs every frame of the movie with whatever ideas pop into his head.  Sometimes this process works brilliantly, but many sequences are a jumbled, cartoonish mess. Furthermore, the lack of edgy, dangerous, morally ambiguous heroes such as Han Solo and Chewbacca makes the simplistic good vs. evil overtones that we tolerated in the original series become genuinely annoying.  This one-two punch of overused special effects and increased character blandness ruined the 'Special Editions' of the original trilogy, and prevents the prequel trilogy from living up to our expectations.Despite all that, I found Episode Two to be reasonably enjoyable.  It's worth the time and money to see it on the big screen.  And the overall theme of the movie (how the threat of war can be manipulated to turn a republic into an evil empire) is actually quite timely and important.",7,0,0,17 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Success!
","Very rarely has a popular book been so successfully adapted to the screen. Peter Jackson's 'Fellowship of the Ring' manages to appeal to die-hard Tolkien fans without pandering to them, and the world he creates remains true to the books without being constrained by them.  This achievement, in and of itself, is worthy of high praise.The cinematography is gorgeous, the attention to detail is staggering, and Jackson's creative vision of Middle Earth builds upon Tolkien's rather than just replicating it by the numbers.  In the background we see ruins of past civilizations, trolls turned to stone, giant statues of legendary kings... we are completely transported into another world.  The special effects are, for the most part, seamlessly integrated into the film and have a flair of originality long missing from factory-issue Hollywood blockbusters.  Not only did 'Fellowship' out-Star-Wars the Star Wars trilogy, it made the unpleasant memory of 'The Phantom Menace' begin to fade from my consciousness entirely.While the dialogue occasionally bordered on cheesey and/or pretentious, Jackson was wise enough to follow the number one rule of fantasy filmmaking: If you want silly made-up words to sound cool, hire Shakespearean-trained British actors.  Indeed, Sir Ian McKellan has effectively rendered it impossible for anyone else to ever play the part of Gandalf.  He was perfect.  The rest of the casting was generally quite good, too.  Elijah Wood may not be the world's finest actor, but he certainly does look like a hobbit.  He may actually BE a hobbit.  I was also very impressed with Sean Bean as Boromir.  His part is actually much better written and more sympathetic than it was in the book, and Bean plays the role with just the right mix of pomposity and good cheer.Just a few minor quibbles... the 'Frodo falls flat on his back' motif is repeated far too many times.  The duel between Gandalf and Saruman is poorly done, despite excellent performances by both actors.  The battle scenes suffer a bit from the herky-jerky camera work that plagues nearly all contemporary action movies.  The plot trajectory is uneven and some scenes feel a bit contrived-- although, given the sheer weight of the source material, I think the editing was better than we had any right to expect.        On the whole, this is the best big-budget action movie in many, many years. Kudos to the cast and crew for tackling such a difficult project and bringing it to life on the screen.",9,0,0,29 January 2002
Armageddon," Possibly the worst big-budget action film ever made
","Scientifically implausible, corny, cliched, filmed in a nauseatingly jerky manner, and overly melodramatic... Armageddon lands itself solidly in the worst 100 films of all time.  Which, given the talented cast and the promising concept, is a tremendous shame.While I was annoyed by the multitude of scientific errors, I tried to sit back and enjoy the movie as harmless entertainment... but the irritatingly bad camera work, annoying characters, and contrived plot made that impossible.  By the end, I was rooting for the asteroid.",2,1,2,16 June 2000
Being John Malkovich," somewhat overrated, but definitely worth watching
","'Being John Malkovich' is a truly unique movie... one of the most bizarre and creative concepts ever captured on film. Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman deserve high praise for unleashing their warped minds and creating a film that almost defies comparison. Yet it has a number of flaws that can't be overlooked. This is certainly a good movie, but I don't consider it to be a true classic.First of all, it drags on far too long. In particular, the beginning scenes prior to the discovery of the portal are almost painfully overextended and barely held my interest. The dialogue was also very stilted at times. After Craig first visits the portal he figures out far too much about it too quickly. The characters also discuss the philosophical ramifications of the portal in a very ham-handed way. In both cases it seemed that Kaufman felt viewers wouldn't understand the visual symbolism and needed the ideas spelled out in detail (although he may have just been poking fun at film critics). Some of the scenes are visionary and hilarious (Craig's puppet shows, Malkovich entering his own brain, the trip through his subconscious) but many others fall flat. The result is a mixed bag. The saving grace is the brilliant performance by Malkovich himself. His good natured self-deprecation and his ability to play several wildly different characters make the movie work. I was also impressed with Cameron Diaz, who proved that when freed from the constraints of beauty and bad scripts, she can be a good actress. I was not as impressed with Catherine Keener as most critics were-- her part was well-written, but she wasn't terribly convincing. In the end, this is a good (7/10) movie that gets an extra point for its spectacular creativity. Spike Jonze shows the potential to be a truly great director. But he isn't quite there yet.",8,0,0,25 August 2000
Dark City," A rare film: intelligent and highly original
","Dark City is a deep, brooding masterpiece--visually stunning and more than a bit creepy. From the very first moments of the film it draws you into its alternate reality. Paranoia is the prevailing mood as shadowy figures control the world from behind the scenes and manipulate people's memories. Our hero, played by Rufus Sewell, wakes up next to the body of a woman he may have killed, his memories erased. His quest to find the truth about his life leads him to discover that nothing around him is as it seems.While the future-noir setting was influenced by such classic films as 'Blade Runner' and 'Brazil', and reality-bending plots have been seen in a number of recent sci fi flicks ('The Matrix', 'The Thirteenth Floor') the overall effect of 'Dark City' is completely unique. The scenery and visual effects are fantastic and add to the atmosphere of fear, confusion, and suspense. The story is original and well-crafted, and the acting is generally superior. It raises thorny questions about the degree to which our access to objective truth is mediated by the press, by the filters of memory, by what we want to believe. There are also several in-jokes for anyone who's ever taken an Abnormal Psych class.It's a shame that this excellent movie was largely overlooked. The only major award it won, for best Sci Fi movie, it had to share with the loathsome 'Armageddon'--a travesty somewhat akin to the AFI declaring that 'Citizen Kane' had to share Movie of the Century honors with 'Jaws: the Revenge'. Sacrilege!",10,0,2,22 June 2000
Children of Men," Love it or hate it, just don't miss it.
","Children of Men is the sort of film that elicits strong opinions, both positive and negative. Cuaron hurls his audience into an alternate world with minimal exposition and expects us to figure out what's happening on our own. The science-fictional plot device is absurd and no effort is made to provide a scientific explanation. The narrative is propelled by unlikely developments and the occasional deus ex machina. The dystopian future of 2027 bears an unfortunate resemblance to the worst neighborhoods of our own era, and those hoping for stylish futuristic sets (a la Blade Runner) will be disappointed.But those who are drawn into Cuaron's world will be mesmerized. There is a vitality and immediacy to the cinematography and directing that has been all too rare in recent years. In the final 30 minutes of the film, viewers are dragged into the hell of a third world refugee camp and forced to experience the chaos and confusion of being innocent bystanders on a battlefield, with no guide book or interpreter. The emotional reaction is powerful and genuine, not coaxed out of us with fluttering flags and orchestral accompaniment. Despite being marketed as science fiction, the power of the movie comes from its extreme realism.This is a film that takes itself seriously, but to me it was not the least bit stuffy or 'pretentious.' The action is intense and often fast-paced, and the characters do not deliver grandiose monologues. The depth of this film lies in its truths that are unspoken, and in its attention to detail. It can be seen in the way the characters grieve for a celebrity death rather than the routine tragedy of a street bombing. It can be glimpsed through a bus window in a refugee camp. It is ultimately driven home in an allusion to the World War 1 Christmas cease-fire, one of the most bizarre, yet illuminating moments in human history. This is not a 'message movie,' but there is more than one message here if you choose to look for it.There are many valid criticisms that can be made of Children of Men, but I strongly reject the claim that this is a work of political propaganda. The political message is powerful precisely because it is NOT propaganda. This film offers us no ideological heroes or easy answers. It simply takes the extremes of poverty, war, and hopelessness in our own world, and eliminates the distance between us and them. Cuaron isn't giving us a solution, but he's forcing us to confront the issues.If you ask me, this is the most powerful and gripping movie I have seen in years. Your mileage may vary.",10,6,11,23 February 2007
Mulholland Drive," No need for plot and character, if you've got enough style.
","---Contains Spoilers---Much time and energy on this site has gone into efforts to reconstruct the plot and timeline of this film from its shattered fragments.  Some have even proposed solutions to the puzzle that ALMOST fit.  But not quite.  As just one example, in the first portion of the film, Diane is dead and Adam is still married.  In the second portion, Adam's divorce is finalized, but Diane is still alive.  It is simply impossible to piece the shards of narrative together, and that (of course) is precisely the point of 'Mulholland Drive'.  David Lynch doesn't merely rearrange the timeline of the story, as happens in such films as 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Memento', he completely destroys the continuity of the characters.  This is a much more jarring disruption of the story, which apparently sends many viewers running headlong for the exits, but makes this flick pretty darn enjoyable for geeks such as myself.     By completely stripping away such artificial details as plot and character, Lynch puts the emphasis on the basic truth contained within the film. Watching the movie in real-time we see the following:  Naïve, bright-eyed ingenue comes to Hollywood hoping to be in the movies...  she is sexually used, betrayed, manipulated by unseen powers, cheated out of parts by a less-talented actress who sleeps with the director... she ends up jaded, bitter, and insane.  We learn that Hollywood is full of freaks, ghouls, murderers, loose women, directors who compromise their idealism under pressure, bizarre and powerful men who manipulate the movie industry, etc. Our heroine falls in love with an exotic amnesiac and tries to help her uncover her mysterious identity, but the woman turns out to be a conniving bitch.  Tragedy ensues.  Roll credits.In the hands of a typical director, this basic story would result in a cheap, formulaic commercial movie.  The story isn't particularly interesting... it's been told a thousand times before.  Why should we care? We all know that plot and character are contrived concepts designed to hook viewers into digesting familiar stories... and to care enough about the ending to sit still for 2 hours and ultimately recommend the movie to their friends.  So Lynch comes to the process in a different manner.  He manipulates plot and character to build suspense, and then dispenses with them when they are no longer necessary.  This allows him to tell the old story in a new, interesting way.  It provides a medium for a bunch of really cool camera shots of Hollywood at night, creepy music, steamy sex scenes, surprising twists, and oddball side characters.   Abstraction and surrealism have been used in literature and visual art for a very long time, and it's surprising how few filmmakers dabble in these techniques.  Some people enjoy it, some don't.  Considering how the entertainment industry strives relentlessly to reach the maximum possible audience with every single production, I find it quite refreshing to see that there are still movie directors who would rather make half their audience angry than worry about maximizing their profits.I personally consider this to be an outstanding film.  Naomi Watts gives an outstanding performance in a complex double role.  The score is bone-chillingly perfect.  The scenery and mood are captivating.  The weird parts are blissfully bizarre.  In other words... it's David Lynch at his Lynchian best.",9,1,1,16 April 2002
Stranger Than Fiction," Charlie Kaufman-lite isn't such a bad thing...
","'Stranger than Fiction' is a smart, entertaining film that doesn't quite achieve greatness, but it's definitely worth a trip to the theater.This is the story of a stiff IRS Agent who slowly realizes that he's actually a character in an unfinished novel, narrated by a voice in his head, and he's slated for imminent death. It would have been an easy setup to play for cheap laughs, or as pseudo-intellectual Oscar bait that takes itself way too seriously. So I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this is actually a very good movie.Will Ferrell's performance is so understated in the early scenes that it almost defeats the purpose of casting him in the role. But as the story builds up steam, he does a fine job of balancing the comic and serious aspects of his character. Ferrell also has surprisingly good chemistry with Maggie Gyllenhaal, who is terrific as usual. Although the romance is not well developed (which makes sense, I suppose, in a film about the formulaic and arbitrary nature of fiction) the scenes between the two are memorable. Queen Latifah is unfortunately wasted in an underdeveloped role, but the rest of the cast is pitch-perfect.It's true that Zach Helm's script can be described as 'Charlie Kaufman-lite', but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The dialogue generates laughs without forcing them, and the story is clever without aggressively reminding us about how clever it is. The metaphysical and literary themes of the story are handled with a light touch, which keeps the fantasy plot devices from feeling completely contrived. By focusing on the human side of the story, rather than just trying to dazzle us with narrative complexity, 'Stranger than Fiction' is ultimately more satisfying than Kaufman's 'Adaptation'.This may be lite literature, but it's very funny in places, it has a stellar soundtrack, and it doesn't require you to check your brain at the door. As far as I'm concerned, that's entertainment.",8,0,1,4 December 2006
Amélie," A film that no sentient creature could possibly dislike.
","French cinema often leaves me underwhelmed, so I was pleasantly shocked by 'Amelie'. Rarely, if ever, has a film so perfectly captured the spirit of a unique character and thoroughly infected its viewers with her charm. But what really caught me off-guard was the film's wonderful sense of humor. Amelie is so many light years more romantic, funny, and creative than Hollywood's recent so-called 'romantic comedies', that the makers of such movies should be forced to quit their professions, move to Uzbekistan, and take up goat-herding.The only meaningful comparison is to 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', but 'Amelie' is significantly more entertaining. Much like a certain other actress named Audrey, Ms. Tautou is absolutely charming. Indeed, the entire cast is stellar, breathing a real vitality into the troop of oddball characters that inhabit Amelie's world. Jean-Pierre Jeunet takes obvious delight in capturing the quirks and oddities of life, adding surprising depth to characters and events that might otherwise feel clichéd.I've heard many people say that they don't like to watch films with subtitles. I say that anyone who can read at a high school level, and possesses a soul, should enjoy 'Amelie'. You'll love it. If nothing else, you will never look at gnomes the same way again.",9,1,3,12 December 2001
Gladiator," Best Picture???
","'Gladiator' is by no means a bad movie, but it doesn't hold a candle to 'Traffic' or 'Crouching Tiger'.It seems that Hollywood wanted to celebrate the rebirth of a classic genre, the Roman epic, but it's a shame that such an unspectacular film has received so many accolades.  In particular, I was highly disappointed with the cinematography.  Why, oh why, do all modern directors (other than Ang Lee) think that every action scene must feature a shaking camera and intermittently altered film speed, both of which interfere with the viewer's ability to actually SEE what's going on?  The battle scenes, while impressively staged, were not filmed nearly as well as 'Braveheart', the swordplay looks quite tame compared to 'Crouching Tiger', and you can find more impressive Colosseum action in 'Spartacus' and 'Ben Hur'. The plot and dialogue were hack writing at best and revisionist history at worst, with clearly American sentiments filling in for anything recognizably Roman.          There is actually a lot to like about this movie.  The sets are dazzling, the acting is quite good, and the drama is often quite real... although it isn't sustained throughout.  Russell Crowe gives a strong performance and commands a tremendous screen presence, although he displays less range than in his earlier work.  Joaquin Phoenix manages (barely) to avoid falling into the realm of camp, although he is dealt quite a few inane lines.  In fact, all the main actors deserve tremendous kudos for salvaging what could have been a bomb in less capable hands.  It's worth noting that 'Gladiator' received Oscars for acting and costumes, not for directing, cinematography, or screenplay.But Best Picture?  Are you kidding me?  This isn't even Ridley Scott's best picture.  I demand a recount.",7,0,0,4 April 2001
