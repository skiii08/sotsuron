Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Nice, but the ending is boring
","Some great moments, but the ending is really boring. Tarantino wants to show us and explain too much at the end which leaves a 'so-so' aftertaste. Also, I think both movies are more 'style over substance', which isn't bad per se, but because of the lack of cohesion I didn't feel much for the characters. Highlights: The 'buried alive scene' + 'girls fight in the trailer'. Very well done.Personally I would like to see 'Kill Bill 0'. How did those guys got together in the first place? Why did they hated Beatrix so much? Just because she broke Bill's heart? That I don't think is enough. Kill Bill 0 could explain this, and show off some cool 'assassin missions'.",6,5,8,20 December 2009
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Staged scenes and reality
","For me, the Borat 'shorts' were usually very funny. The way he approaches people that do not realise he's not from Kazachstan, is very nice.However this film about Borat really fails to be funny. Most of the time his character relies on sex, while the shorts often contain very politic elements (e.g animal protection group, government election, etc).My problem is that the makers of this movie staged several scenes, and want you to believe it is real. I have no problems with staged scenes that carry the story: it's clearly fiction! But the 'drivers lesson' scene and the 'student in a van' scene to name a few, made me think: 'hey, do the makers really want to cheat me? Do they think the public is dumb?'.How big the nonsense is; as a maker you should not underestimate the public, don't cheat them! Some great scenes include the rodeo anthem, the Pamela scene and the nude-in-a-hotel scene (a scene where 'sex' is also functional; it's terribly embarrassing to see how people respond).",4,3,6,14 April 2007
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Disappointing sequel.
","I enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes a lot. The mystery, the dynamic between Watson and Sherlock and the camera work was brilliant.This sequel disappointed me. Unnecessary ultra-slow motion effects, an overly eccentric Sherlock, messy plot, superhero action ('Sherlock vision' is kinda ridiculous) and lack of investigation ruined this movie for me. It feels as if the movie has been created for the sake of showing off. Even the 'bad guy' doesn't get the chance of showing his acting abilities - and the man can definitely act!It seems Guy Richie couldn't handle the success of the first movie. I hope for the third installment (if there will be any), he'll focus on story, characters and dialog instead of fancy effects and locations.",5,2,4,5 January 2013
The Hateful Eight," A movie I truly HATE.
","This movie is absolutely dreadful. Filled with redundant, non-interesting dialogue and action moments that do not serve the story other than trying to come across as 'cool'.
A razor thin story is stretched on and on. No character is interesting, no one who you can sympathize with in any way.
I've never been more annoyed and bored at the cinema. I really hate-watched it from start to finish, which fits the name of the film I guess. 
This is Tarantino at its worst: self indulgent, arrogant and plain uninteresting. A far cry from his master pieces like Jackie Brown, or Pulp Fiction.
Time to go back to shooting low budget productions again to find your creative spark, Quentin?",1,8,12,28 January 2018
The Hateful Eight," Hated it. HATED IT.
","Pointless and repetitive dialogue between all kinds of naughty card-board characters. It was challenging to stay awake - blah blah blah -violence - blah blah, rinse and repeat.
At least in Pulp Fiction, the characters are rich and not a single line of any dialogue is purposeless.
The ending, the plot, didn't surprise me at all and was very weak.
It's easy to criticize if you haven't shot a single movie yourself, but this is Tarantino and he deserves to be reviewed with the reputation he has built. This was one of the worst, maybe the worst, film he has made.",1,5,7,3 September 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Extremely exhausting
","What's so exhausting is the fact that this is a sequence of noisy scenes edited together without proper rhythm or room for true feelings. It's a constant overkill of special effects, chases, contrived over-dramatic dialog, explosions, all without ever taking any risk. You know from minute one that no lead will die or get hurt, and only puppets/living props will.Without anything at stake, the explosions and lightning gets tiring very quickly because you feel you are wasting your time, only made worse by lazy, sloppy writing that doesn't take in account any visible constraints in physics, human strength and without any attempt to plug any plot holes.
Visits to planets are quick and serve nothing more than a different visual background. The scale of practically every location is so huge, you can't relate to them anymore as a human being.Everything I watch feels like repeating an existing scene from one of the past movies.
There's nothing surprising, nothing daring, nothing authentic.After the previous Star Wars movie (a true cinematic abortion) and this one, I'm just too exhausted to watch another one ever again.",4,10,12,16 June 2020
Baby Driver," Boring and cliche
","I love Edgar Wright as a director. He is original and has a great talent for combining action and humor, and creative visual storytelling.That said, this movie was extremely stupid. Full of cliches and so cartoony in approach that I felt there wasn't anything at stake. No true danger as characters were front flipping their bodies over burning cars while shooting with guns in both hands that only seemed to kill characters when the director felt it was convenient. Most scenes were predictable and stereotypical. Cliche and easy.The movie started out alright, but the last half felt like a punishment and I was just watching it to see if it would change for the good.Skip it!",3,2,5,26 September 2019
Dark City," Jennifer Connelly has a mustache in this movie
","This movie was nice to watch, but Jennifer Connelly has a mustache clearly visible in several shots, especially when she is singing (with a band that doesn't sync with the sound, especially the drummer). That distracted me. Couldn't she spend more time in front of the mirror next time?I didn't like the slow ending with too much revealing special effects (I rather didn't see the total shots of the city in space, that ruined the 'reality' for me.Also a bit far fetched to see a dying alien species going through all the trouble of experimenting with us. Couldn't they find a better solution? Since they are so sophisticated, couldn't they understand this wasn't gonna work a bit sooner?But all in all great to watch. Great visuals.",7,0,5,27 November 2011
Dunkirk," Terrible
","Saw Dunkirk with my wife and we were both seriously underwhelmed. I went out to the 70mm screening and everything. I found myself struggling to care about anyone in the movie and the story. I found the asynchronous time lines to be more irritating than clever. I found the lack of any real meaning in the deaths to be boring. There was a serious lack of any real grit or bite to the film. In the end, every emotional scene felt more manipulative than earned - a problem that was literally and figuratively amplified by the scoring by Hans Zimmer forcing emotions upon the viewer, instead of letting the story and its characters accomplish that. At times the music was unbearable.
Other people I know who went out to see the movie thought there was something wrong with the scale of the battle (apparently it was much, much bigger in scale in reality) but that didn't bother me personally. The cinematography was excellent.Everyone is giving it so much praise and I just genuinely don't see what other people like about it. Can someone explain to me what I'm not getting?",3,3,4,1 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A lot of screen time and not enough story
","I read multiple reviews saying the movie is boring. I didn't find it boring at all. It kept me entertained. The pace was slow - something I am used to with episode content where characters have time to develop. To me this movie felt like a long episode of a show, something half way season 2.The cinematography is amazing, the acting was excellent.Margot Robbie started to annoy me; the entire movie she is smiling and dancing and says like 20 words in total. She's like a princess living in a dream world and I guess it was Tarantino's thing to show what we all wanted to happen to her, hence 'once upon a time in Hollywood'. I was just longing for character development, and not just with her.
The criticism is that I want to see episode 3, 4, 5, etc.Not a bad movie. Tarantino pissed me off with the Hateful Eight - a simple and lazy story disguised as something complex, 90% boring dialogue and some violence. This one I enjoyed much, much more. It's just not something I'll remember for long.That said, I share the same love for Hollywood/LA, but from my personal (contemporary) experience, and I could feel his love for an era and connect me, even though I was never there myself at the time.",6,1,2,17 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Lazy writing
","As a gatekeeper of a franchise that spawns decades you have a big responsibility to keep a 'rule book' of what is allowed to happen to keep stories believable. I can be convinced of a time travelling DeLorean after 30 seconds screen-time, as long as there are certain limitations the characters have to deal with, weaknesses or rules that cannot be broken, whether they are explicitly mentioned in the film or not.
If these rules suddenly shift or are thrown out of the window, it ruins the believability and disrespects its viewers. This is why the Matrix 2 and 3 for example were absolutely atrocious sequels to an excellent original.
Having rules that limit what can or should happen forces writers to think of smart ways to propel the story forward, avoid 'cop outs' and as a result keep people invested in all the characters and the world(s) they inhabit.So, having princess Leia's ship getting shot and have her thrown out of the ship through fire, explosions and millions of pieces of glass debris into the cold dark void, a vacuum killing any human within a minute, and then have her Force powers fly her back to the ship like friggin' Mary Poppins is not what I find acceptable. Having her die instantly would have been so much better and frankly would have been a much more respectful tribute to her legacy as an actress. It would have been a bold move, but taken her character seriously and tell viewers the stakes are truly high. What happened in the movie was absolutely horrible. An intern could have written a better scene.Similarly, having the bad guys ship destroyed by flying through it at light speed is cool and all, but then having a crazy battle at the gigantic ship launch pad with some sort of mech warrior thing, without dealing with the fact pressure and oxygen are gone by now is just lazy writing and sloppy direction. Oh and having Finn fall off a platform and coincidentally lift him up because there happens to be a rising platform wasn't exactly a great writing moment either.Lastly, the whole 'connect people through the Force at distance' was something I personally found very much acceptable for the majority of the movie, knowing that during that time both characters realize they are being 'tele-connected' when it occurs. 
However, this concept gets obliterated at the end of the movie by the same writers who introduced this concept just an hour before. Kylo Ren gets tricked seeing Luke Skywalker and only realizes he is some sort of a tele-hologram when he isn't able to hit him with his saber. So, the writers didn't just didn't rewrite the rules of what they introduced just an hour prior, they made this inconsistency an important plot device in the film! How lame is that. There are more examples but I don't want to bore y'all. Bottom line: I was truly disappointed with this film and I'm getting fed up with Star Wars as an franchise pretty quickly mainly because the writing. Such a shame.",1,3,4,4 August 2018
The Fountain," weird, yet intriguing
","Wow. This was hard to watch. As the narrative progresses, the storyline starts to make sense, but as a viewer you are always one step behind. Continuously trying to find a meaning for the scene you just watched. The strange thing is that, once you let go of that urge, it starts making more sense. Yes, I didn't get at least 30% of the movie, but that didn't matter to me so much.Some people might find this movie pretentious. I'd say 'niche' for now. What I liked is that I deeply cared for the protagonists. There are real emotions on screen here, the acting is terrific. It must have been a hard part to play since the movie is so abstract, so much full of symbolism. I didn't found the movie easy to watch, but in the end I could appreciate exactly that.",7,0,2,3 February 2012
Inception," Lifeless. Wants too be too smart for its own good
","Can't believe the high reviews as I think it's the worst Nolan productions to date. Means: it's a good/average movie, but not great.The whole movie is just too stylistic, the romance is cold and uninteresting, the characters are one dimensional, and the whole dream thing is just too stylistic. The movie wants to be too intelligent for its own good. I preferred how dreams where presented in 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind': blurry, not cohesive stories and unpredictable.Inception used dreamworlds as a cheap way of adding car chases, shoot outs in snow. The whole dream-in-dream thing is nice but doesn't add anything to the story.The romance thingie is just annoying to watch. I just don't care. But I should.Meh.",4,10,17,13 February 2011
Inception," A lot of explanations of rules, and then nothing interesting happens.
","First of all, why didn't DiCaprio asked Alfred the butler to fly in his kids to meet him, if he isn't allowed to enter the United States? Money doesn't seem to be the problem here. This is a big plot hole that makes his entire quest unneccesssry. Just live somewhere else together!The biggest problem I have with this movie is that it isn't 'intelligent' at all. It's a novel idea, yes, but the execution isn't that intelligent. Basically we are told many rules (the bath tub, the architect, dream in dream time, the token, and much more) but it all ends up being an ordinary action flick with cheap chases, e.g ski scene, shooting bad guys chasing in the city, floating people fighting each other, and so forth. 
Nothing really interesting is done with architecting and manipulating environments in dreams, building 'mazes' and the actual 'incepting'. It's like introducing a 10-man band with cool musical instruments and amazing musicians, and then only stick to playing basic children songs. Nolan tends to forget the 'show don't tell' rule, an issue also present in Interstellar.",4,3,4,13 August 2018
Cloud Atlas," Too ambitious
","I guess this story is so complex, it belongs to a book - not a movie. I've been staring at great visuals. The storyline is...something. But it all feels insignificant. Just before I start to care about the character, I'm thrown into another era with the same characters dressed as someone else. I just makes me...not care. They seem to transcend death anyway so why bother?Everything is presented at a level of perfection and in so much quantities. Epic is an understatement. What's left for the viewer to imagine? I cannot escape the fact the animators are a team of designers with a mouse. They're not auteurs. They're not feeling anything as they animate. Great graphics. So what? The greatest animators put a ton of subtlety and personal feeling into their work. The world of Cloud Atlas just feels sterile.",6,0,2,23 December 2012
