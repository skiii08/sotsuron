Black Swan," One hell of a movie
","Darren Arnofsky has gone through a change of taste in filmmaking within the past 10 years and after the first decade of the 21st century he topped it off with one of his best. Black Swan is a fascinating story that brings snippets of different aspects from all his movies combined with the very profound story of a belle dancer which creates this very beautiful film. The blacks,whites, and subtle pinks in the set design bring such a unique feeling that most movies are not doing now a days. Portman and Kunis's roles were articulated perfectly to the very last bit of dialouge. But the things that really made me give this movie a 8 rather than a 10 is the music and some of the special effects were a bit of a let down for me. The epic Lux Aterna from Requiem to the sorrow filled compositions of the fountain to this was no comparison. The Wrestlers music had done the same to me as Black Swan too.Anyone who is a Arnofsky fan should go see it though no matter what. Its in the top 10 best movies of the year in my book. Hope this helps.",7,7,16,16 November 2010
Drive," Actions speak louder than words
","This is one of those films that targets a niche audience. If your one for the mainstream flicks that Hollywood endlessly feeds us, than there is a high chance that this movie will not satisfy your taste. But if your one for enjoying a grind/art house and or foreign picture, or simply something a bit outlandish, you may find Drive to be a very enjoyable and rememberable film. Its concoction of 80's throwback and modern ambient score meshed with ultra violence, the substitution of body language for words and a traditional crime noir genre picture wrapped in the structure of a fairy tale/super hero story, is what makes this tale unique. If you are a well rounded cinema goer then you most likely will recognize the pastiche of work borrowed (e.g. the man with no name Clint Eastwood character, korean style action pacing, Miami Vice/Bullet/Driver Esq crime plot) This interesting mix is what makes Drive so refreshing. Contrary to the cult following's love for this movie, numerous people have stated that Drive was god awful. But it's not that the movie is poorly crafted, but rather the greater audience simply cant be entertained or understand a film I would classify as introverted. What Gosling and Mulligan share on screen is a strong connection that is shown through action not words. This may not equate to the type of entertainment most Americans are accustomed to and that is one common reason why Drive falls short in the eye of the masses. Other's say the premise is clich√©, I will admit I thought the same... but it's the near flawless execution of such common material that makes it so refreshing. Many critics and film enthusiasts love this picture because they don't watch films strictly for entertainment but rather for the craft of filmmaking and the deeper meaning behind the stories and character interactions; Drive is very much a film for the deep thinker. Im not saying it's an intellectual piece of cinema, but rather a movie where you must understand and enjoy the nature of passionate introverts and visual symbolism to really LOVE IT. Drive is easily in my top 5 films of 2011, top 50 of the past 10 years, and top 100 of what I've seen. If you're wondering why I only gave the movie an 8 out of 10 then, its because no movie in my eyes deserves a 10 or a 100% because no movie is perfect and it wont receive a 9 because although I love this film, due to its withdrawn/introverted minimalist nature, it lacks the ability to convey a wide range of emotions that the majority of truly outstanding films deliver.",8,3,8,21 August 2012
Limitless," What a surprise!
","I got the privileged to go to an advance screening of Limitless with A Q and a with screenwriter Lesley Dixon at my school tonight. I came in with very low expectations due to the horrible advertising but came out with a big smile and a feeling of satisfaction. The movie is very unique in every aspect. The dialog is comparable to The Social Network in intricacy and craftsmanship, the acting was great (not Oscar worthy but got the job done very well), Music/Sound was very enjoyable and unique, the cinematography/color palate was great but the editing stood out the most and will definitely be nominated for an Oscar. With the screenwriter having more freedom than most writers these days as well as her producing input, it aloud the movie to be well crafted and tastefully done rather than a Hollywood crap flick. It is definitely the best movie of the year so far, which isn't really saying much, but hopefully it sets the bar for even better films to come.",7,22,44,11 March 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A striking spectacle that requires no thinking for enjoyment
","I have been anticipating this goliath blockbuster since the day I saw the first trailer. My expectations were simple; lots of epic action, ground breaking visuals, and awesome sound effects. I received slightly more though. Dark of the Moon is a big step up in all aspects comparing to its predecessors. It delivered the most advanced live action visuals and 3d elements to ever be apart of a live action movie. Being the extremely critical person I am who usually enjoys films that deliver exceptional acting and well told storys, I ended up being obsessed with this movie, but for for all the right reasons. Epic action, hot women, and cool fx. If you're not into that then this movie wont be for you.P.S. I still am waiting to see this movie one more time before I can really give my true rating.",7,1,6,29 June 2011
