Requiem for a Dream," Visual compelling and emotionally knocks your breathe out (minor spoiler)
","For me this film, is one of most visually compelling films I have seen in recent times.  I quite like the use of split screen and the fast cuts between shots.You do really care for the characters and get drawn into their lives.  You see how inhumanely people can treat one another and it is so tragic.You see how drugs can affect people and the toll substance abuse takes.The end of the film stays in your mind for some time. The film was still resonating with me the next day.The only minor niggle is I did not get to know enough about where the character Tyrone comes from.  And this is really a minor point.",9,0,0,12 February 2001
