The Ring," It was a free movie... and I still want my money back.
","I saw the movie as part of a free screening, and I will never get those two hours of my life back.  I am usually very susceptible to suspense/horror films.  This movie was not suspenseful or horrifying in the least bit. You can count the number of scenes in which there is something shocking on one hand.  You know the whole time how the movie is going to turn out, and the few little plot twists aren't very well thought out.I give it a 1/10... the one point being for a somewhat unique concept.",Null,0,0,25 September 2002
The Fast and the Furious," Working Title... Point Break: Part 2
","Making a hit Hollywood film is tough... but you need to know when to call it quits.  Or... hey, just take a movie like... hmm... Point Break and change the words around.  In fact, why don't we just keep some of the lines the same?Don't get me wrong; I felt that this was a good movie, but the plot was very reminiscent of Point Break.  At times I had a hard time paying attention to the movie, because I already knew what was going to happen.Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should go out and see it.  Anyone who liked Point Break should go see this movie.  Anyone who didn't like Point Break hey, go see it anyways it's pretty good.",Null,0,1,29 June 2001
