Requiem for a Dream," Julia Roberts?
",How can anyone have voted for Julia Roberts after seeing Ellen Burstyn in 'Requiem for a Dream'?  Ellen Burstyn far deserved the best actress title over Julia.  'Requiem' is an amazing movie with amazing talent. Definitely one of the best of 2000.  Ellen Burstyn is amazing!  And the other three are great too.  Definately a 10.  It leaves you feeling disturbed but you slowly realize what a good movie this really is.   The only injustice to this movie is not giving Ellen Burstyn the credit she deserves.,10,0,0,5 June 2001
