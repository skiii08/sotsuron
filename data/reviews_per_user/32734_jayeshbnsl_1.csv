Airlift," Overrated
","This is a very highly overrated movie.This just tricks us into fake republic day patriotism.Yes the film has a new storyline and original one but performances are highly mediocre.Some people are saying that this is the best movie by Akshay Kumar.The film also shows bureaucracy in bad light.Yes,we as a country were ill prepared that time but that does not mean we don't value our citizens.Movies like Special 26,Baby etc had better acting +Storyline.Music as we all know is copied mostly and the film shows a person mantle rather than teamwork. Just want to summarize saying that its a decent time-pass movie but not worth going hall for.Better watch on DVD sets and that too once.",6,2,4,1 February 2016
