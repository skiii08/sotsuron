Blade Runner 2049," A film about the soul
","I rarely stop to write a review. But last night I was struck by this masterpiece. I've seen Blade Runner more than 10 times and never thought that a sequel could surpass it, I do not know if in history, but yes in cinematography, art direction and music. It is dark and bright at the same time, an unforgettable color palette, an atmosphere so real, that you seem to live it. Time flies by, even though some shots seem to be a little longer than necessary. The story is about the soul, what is soul? Those beings that will be created genetically artificial, will have soul? Playing God, man can fall into his own trap. No matter how or who creates us, we all deserve and feel a soul, whether you are a believer or not. You have to see it several times, at the cinema.",10,5,15,14 October 2017
Deadpool 2," Cool and Comic
","No second parties were good, but Deadpool2 is the exception that confirms the rule. After The Empire Strikes Back, of course. It's a cool, very funny, very well made film widely bill. The cast is luxurious, the story is simple, but perfect. The sound and the effects go for an Oscar. Totally recomdable if you want to have a good time. Side note is the cast, Josh Brolin, T.J. Miller, Julian Dennison are spectacular.",10,2,5,21 May 2018
Aladdin," It has the touch of Guy Ritchie
","Is a very entertaining movie. It does not stop, and when the typical songs from Disney movies come, they are small capsules and nothing freaky and boring.
The costumes and the art direction are spectacular, lots of color and fashion.
There are two characters that steal the movie: Will Smith and his characterization of Genius, is fantastic. Too funny and with a superlative sense of humor. The other one is the monkey, great. Too nice.
If you want to spend an afternoon entertaining, with a movie that teaches you something of life, fast, colorful and musical, you can not miss it.
Finally, both Aladdin and Jazmin are very well characterized, the casting was perfect.
Mention to part is the final song of Jazmin, Speechless. Candidate for the Oscar.",9,1,2,10 June 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Years not seen such a good movie
","Wonderful photograph, an electrifying story, characters who steal the film, but they know to share the screen. Miller: You're a master you can do Happy Feet and this masterpiece. Charlize has a fascinating performance and Tom Hardy is a more humane Mad Max that Gibson, has very good looks and seems to have improved his performance every days. The film does not let you rest and two hours fly by. I really recommend it for those who enjoyed the first three films, and for the young people who come to know the universe of Miller. I went with my daughter aged sixteen and was fascinated. A world that can dream but the film shows what a surreal grandeur and rawness that can not imagine.",10,4,15,17 May 2015
