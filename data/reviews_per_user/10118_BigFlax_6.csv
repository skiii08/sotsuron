The Blair Witch Project," Boring and not scary
","It seems that many people, including most reviewers, consider 'The Blair Witch Project' to be one of the scariest horror movies ever and just a darn good movie in general.  Having seen it, I can't for the life of me figure out why.Not only is it not even remotely scary even in the parts where it should be the scariest, but it's unbearably boring and the camera work nauseates.I'll grant that a film that is supposedly pieced together from random footage shot in the woods is going to have camera work that looks like that, and that without all the aimless walking around and yelling, the movie would only be about 20 minutes long.  But I'm sorry, I just couldn't take it.  It was hands down one of the few movies I've ever seen where I actually contemplated walking out of the theater.  And the only reason I didn't was because I was curious as to what the ending was.  But it was almost not worth staying.Bottom line: not scary, not thrilling, not exciting, not even interesting. Only the acting, quite good for the fact that it was totally improvised, deserves to be commended.  F",1,0,2,24 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I've bought into the hype
","I'll be very honest: I never bought much into the Star Wars phenomenon.  I saw the original and I didn't think it was that darn great, and I never saw Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi.  But Episode I: The Phantom Menace is, simply put, AWESOME.Sure, the acting leaves a bit to be desired, but it's not as terrible as some would have you believe.  And although a few things in the plot are left unexplained, it's nothing so major as to cause you to go 'Who's that?', at least not in my opinion.  And the movie is, hands down, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen.So, I've bought into the hype, finally.  See Star Wars Episode I.  See it many, many times.

Man on the Moon," An average movie at best
","I'm not sure exactly what to make of the latest Jim Carrey film, Man on the Moon.  I can only assume that the film seeks to provide insight into the life of Andy Kaufman (Carrey); show something of the man behind the act.  If that's the case, I am also forced to assume that writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski just didn't have much information to work with.    For example, we learn very little of Kaufman's relationship with girlfriend Lynne Margulies (Courtney Love).  And as for the film's habit of revealing every single one of Kaufman's acts as fakes, mere practical jokes on the viewer, there aren't many people left who don't know that for themselves.    The main problem with the movie is that much of it is simply recreations of Kaufman's varied acts, from the Saturday Night Live 'Mighty Mouse' routine, to different clips from 'Taxi,' to his wrestling performances with Jerry Lawler.  Carrey is an admirable Kaufman, becoming the late comedian so well that one forgets it's Jim Carrey up there.  But so what?  Anyone going to see the movie is probably familiar with Kaufman's act, and if they're not they probably won't find it that funny.    I don't have much to say about this movie.  The basic plot simply runs through Kaufman's life from the time he gets his big break via George Shapiro (Danny DeVito), through 'Taxi,' which he never really wanted to do, through his (entirely staged) run-ins with Jerry Lawler, and finally through his death.  The movie's ending is left intentionally ambiguous.  Did Andy Kaufman fake his own death?  Is the king of convincing pranks pulling a huge one on the world?  Probably not.  But it's something to think about as you leave the movie.    Because not much else in it is particularly thought-provoking. B-",7,0,0,28 December 1999
The Insider," Intense, realistic, and brilliant
","Normally, films that use a lot of hand-held camera or oddly-composed shots really bother me.  Michael Mann's use of the two in The Insider, however, is nothing short of brilliant.  This is not a movie.  It's an intense, visceral immersion in what it's like to put your future on the line for something you believe is right.  The audience does not watch The Insider - it walks alongside the camera as two men, 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), put everything they have at stake to make sure the world finds out that the tobacco companies deliberately misled the public over the knowledge they had of their product's effects.  It is a raw, powerful, engaging experience, with Pacino and Crowe at the top of their game (as well as a fine supporting turn by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace) providing masterful compliments to Mann's blistering direction.  Possibly the best film of 1999 (jockeying with American Beauty), The Insider is one of the ten best films to take its story from actual events ever made.",10,2,3,13 October 2003
The Green Mile," The rare film that succeeds in spite of itself
","When just about everything else comes together in a movie, gaping flaws in the premise can often be overcome.  Such is the case in Frank Darabont's second Stephen King prison adaptation, The Green Mile.  It's not just that it's hard to believe a mob of white people with shotguns would have turned a suspected black child killer over to the authorities in 1935 Louisiana, but this is a questionable plot point to start a goofily supernatural story.  This is not to say that a movie can't be done well if it features a Christ metaphor (E.T.) or a somewhat off-the-wall supernatural happening that even the characters seem to be having difficulty reconciling (Field of Dreams), but The Green Mile does not carry its premise as well, in no small part due to how ridiculous it looks when Michael Clarke Duncan grabs Tom Hanks for a minute and then expels a whole bunch of black things.  (Apparently all illnesses are caused by evil and not, say, bacteria or viruses.)Regrettably, The Green Mile doesn't quite get past the goofiness of the story.  It has some decent (if obvious) lessons to offer, but they're somewhat obscured by the heavy-handed allegory.  The game cast, led by a strong Hanks and filled out with numerous solid performances, does what it can to make up for that problem - and they're mostly successful, also helped by good cinematography and an atmospheric score by Thomas Newman (though Darabont might have avoided some of the inevitable comparisons to The Shawshank Redemption - not nearly all, but perhaps some - if he hadn't hired the same composer and then allowed him to make half his cues sound pulled from the earlier film).The film's earnestness as regards the story is almost its undoing, but the cast and crew mostly bail out the narrative shortcomings.  The film doesn't even drag at over three hours, which is impressive.  The Green Mile is truly a best-case scenario for defining the term 'elevating the material.'",7,1,3,13 October 2003
Scream," Not as good as they say
","'Scream' was praised when it came out for being a fine send-up of slasher movies and a good work of satire.  On the contrary, 'Scream' is, while markedly witty, woefully under-clever and simply another lousy slasher film aspiring to be more.Furthermore, like many films of its ilk, 'Scream' is not what most people would call scary.  It uses guys in masks popping out of nowhere and buckets of blood to create the illusion of horror, but slasher flicks are not 'horror.'  Psychological horror movies like the films of Steven King are true horror movies.'Scream' does seem to be somewhat of a satire of slasher films, but its problem is that the satire is too obvious, as Kevin Williamson's script delights itself in pointing out 'Hey, I'm a work of satire' every few minutes.At least, unlike its followup, the even less clever and completely un-witty 'Scream 2', this movie is at times partially enjoyable if highly unrealistic.  In real life, a person who gets stabbed any number of times will probably not be able to still get up and walk around pretty well.All in all, the movie tries to be something it isn't and shouldn't aspire to be: by making a slasher pic trying to satirize other slasher pics and making it even more bloody than many other slasher pics are, you haven't elevated yourself above them at all.  The movie has only one truly great scene that I'd guess was probably lost on most people: when Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy) is watching Halloween and doesn't see the killer standing right behind him, all the time exhorting Halloween's heroine, 'Look behind you, Jamie!  Turn around!'  A gleeful bit of self-reference that provided one of the few enjoyable moments in an otherwise forgettable film.",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
