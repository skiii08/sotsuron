Catch Me If You Can," Enjoyable but not a memorable classic
","Catch Me if You Can' is inspired by the real life story of conman Frank Abagnale Junior who ran away from home at the age of sixteen following his parents' divorce.  His deceit includes pretending to be an airline pilot, doctor and barrister all while he is still a teenager.  As he travels around the globe cashing fraudulent cheques, Frank is pursued by FBI Special Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) hence, the taunt in the film's title.What makes this film an interesting and fun one is that the main character actually exists in real life and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is a charismatic one.  Although I found some parts of Catch Me if you Can' enjoyable, I did find it a bit slow and the story-telling flawed.  Although one can conclude that Frank was a genius to have deceived as many people as he did, the film is lacking in explanation of how Frank managed to succeed in the range of positions he came to work in, eg how did he become a doctor and barrister without going to either medical or law school?As a fan of Steven Spielberg's work, I was looking forward to this release and compared to his last two films A.I' and Minority Report', this film is much lighter in tone.  Although entertaining while it lasts, Catch Me if You Can' is not the memorable classic that I was hoping for.",6,0,2,26 March 2003
Minority Report," A meaty story that is gripping until the very end
","The film is set in a future where people are arrested for crime before it is committed, thanks to the information supplied to the authorities by three pre-cognitives.  Tom Cruise plays cop John Anderton who is forced to go on the run to avoid arrest for a murder that he is expected to commit in 36 hours.  Immediately, this is an intriguing prospect for a film.Following, Vanilla Sky', I was interested to see whether Tom Cruise's next cinematic release would be a more mainstream one.  The promotional posters suggest fast pace action and the trailer I had seen consisted of several cool and slick looking set-pieces: Tom Cruise sorting through images generated by the Pre-Cogs with waves of gloved hands in search of clues to the location of a crime and spider robots scurrying across the floor while Cruise is submerged in the bath.  What I feared was another Mission Impossible' a film with a couple of cool set-pieces but with little substance to the plot.With Minority Report, it is not non-stop action as one may expect but this is by no means a bad thing.  Instead Spielberg treats us to a meaty story with twists that is gripping until the very end where the plot springs one final surprise with the unmasking of the villain of the film.  Perhaps a less experienced director would have been less ambitious with the storyline and produced a less satisfactory film.The film has a dark and sinister feel throughout which is to a large extent brought about by the play-back of disturbing and violent visions of the future combined with the pre-cognitives' bizarre appearance. 
A combination of mastery from Spielberg and star power of Cruise have resulted in an impressive piece of work that is both visually and mentally stimulating.  There is however, a little too much techie speak for my liking which does give the feeling later on that I had missed something crucial but that only makes the film worthy of a second viewing.This could well end up being one of the best films of the year.",9,0,0,14 July 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Yawnsome -should have remained as the Walt Disney World theme park ride it is inspired by
","As a child, Elizabeth Swann spots Will Turner floating unconscious in the water when she is at sea with her father, the British Governor.  After Will has been rescued, Elizabeth discovers and takes the coin hanging around his neck (a sign that Will is a pirate).  As an adult, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) wears this coin round her own neck and because of this, she is kidnapped by the crew of pirate ship, the Black Pearl who are cursed to sail the seas in a ghostly zombie-like state.  Only when the coin is returned to its treasure chest will this curse be lifted.  It is then up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) with the help of pirate Jack Sparrow to rescue the Governor's daughter.A good selling point of the film is its cast which includes pretty actors Bloom, Knightley and Depp (personally, I don't know what the fuss is about with Orlando Bloom to me he is merely a younger version of Antonio Banderas).  Depp gives a likeable but over-the performance as the drunk and cockney accented Jack Sparrow and other big names include Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, the captain of the Black Pearl, and Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's Governor father.  Also, look out for Gareth of The Office' fame as one of the pirates!  All seem to be having fun with some acting more befitting to a pantomime than a film.  The main problem I have with this film is that the pirate concept holds little interest for me (I am however, slightly amused by the obligatory Oooh Arrr's in pirate speak).  The main source of excitement is the fight sequences during which we see some good special effects of the crew of the Black Pearl appearing as a combination of skeleton and rotting flesh when exposed to direct moonlight.  However, the fighting soon becomes dull and repetitive.  Because the villains are already dead, there does not appear to be a quick resolution and as a result, the film is painfully drawn out to well over two hours in length.Young children and those who are intrigued and excited by the prospect of pretty actors romping about and fighting on ships and the hoisting of the Jolly Roger will probably enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean'.  If you arrive to the cinema in a panto frame of mind, you will have a lot of fun but unfortunately the film left this viewer cold.",5,1,2,1 September 2003
Finding Nemo," Visually stunning and hugely enjoyable
","Over-protective clownfish Marlin (Albert Brooks) witnesses his only surviving offspring Nemo being captured by a deep-sea diver soon after a moment of rebelliousness from the youngster.  Frantic, Marlin endeavours to find his son with the help of an amnesiac fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres). On his quest, he also meets sharks which have formed a Fish-Eaters Anonymous group, and a group of surfer turtles' that speak like Bill and Ted.Meanwhile, Nemo has been released into a fish tank in a dentist's waiting room in Sydney.  There, he meets a group of fellow prisoners led by angelfish Gill (Willem Dafoe) who has devised a cunning plot for them all to escape.   The challenge that Pixar faces here is to make fish as cute and as loveable as the furry leads of previous animated successes.  Anthropomorphism goes far enough to over ride the fact that in the wild, fish lay eggs and then neglect their offspring and to allow Dory to read the handwritten name and address on Nemo's abductor's neglected goggles.Having enjoyed both Toy Story' and Monsters Inc', I found Finding Nemo' just as good.  The success of Pixar features is down to the studio's story-telling skills and their ability to entertain the whole family: familiar quotes such as Hop inside my mouth if you want to live' will be appreciated by adults but lost on kids.  However, there is still plenty to entrance the youngsters as well although I do feel that the film is overlong for very young children.Brilliant characterisation and glorious animation makes Finding Nemo' stunning and charming to watch.  This is a visual treat not to be missed. Also, the fun continues to the end of the credits so don't be too eager to leave your seat!",9,0,2,6 December 2003
Closer," Engaging performances by a powerhouse cast make for a very interesting film
","'Closer' plays as a sequence of incidents in the lives of four main characters with passage of differing lengths of time between each scene so that to a certain extent, the audience has to fill in the gaps.The film opens with a shot on a busy street where Dan (Jude Law) and Alice (Natalie Portman) are walking towards each other to a soundtrack of Damien Rice's 'The Blower's Daughter' (I loved this track the instant I heard it and it suits the opening and end scenes so well). There is a spark as Dan and Alice catch each other's eye but before introductions are made, Alice is knocked down by a taxi and Dan accompanies her to the hospital. At this point in time, we learn that Dan is an obituary writer. Later, we find out that he has used Alice's life as the subject of his novel. He meets Anna (Julia Roberts) who photographs him and they end up kissing. As a result of a prank Dan plays when chatting to Larry (Clive Owen) on an Internet chat room, Larry meets Anna at the London Aquarium.At times, the film protrudes the intensity of a theatre production which is little surprise as 'Closer' is an adaptation of a Patrick Marber play. All four leads play on the whole, unsympathetic characters but are no less interesting because of it. Natalie Portman even plays against type as a stripper. At times, the film is darkly funny and I would not recommend this film if explicit dialogue offends you.This is a love story that is different from the norm and deals effectively with the issue of deception and how it impacts on the lives of the central characters.",7,0,0,22 January 2005
Lilo & Stitch," Refreshingly different from the usual Disney fare
","Lilo is an orphaned Hawaiian girl who is brought up alone by her elder sister. They adopt a dog, Stitch which unknown to them, is actually a mutant alien accidentally landed on Earth and has been designed to destroy everything it touches.   Despite Stitch's genetic tendencies towards destruction, a bond forms between girl and alien while the scientist who created Stitch also arrives on Earth to capture him. Lilo is an adorable but rebellious little girl who loves Elvis.  Therefore, instead of characters bursting into song singing the usual Disney tunes, we get Elvis songs on the soundtrack which makes for a refreshing change. Stich is immediately unattractive, being a big-eared four armed monstrosity designed for destruction and creating havoc.  Like with Warner Brothers' Tasmanian Devil, it is down to the animation and characterisation which up the cute factor and allow for the audience to warm towards the alien.It seems like Disney have gone with the times, choosing to deal with the issue of a single parent family.  In doing so, they keep the right balance of sensitivity and compassion in the relationship between the two sisters without being sickeningly sentimental. As is often the case in animated features, part of the fun is to work out who the familiar voices belong to:  Lilo's older sister Nani is played by Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee plays Nani's friend who offers her a shoulder to cry on (and probably wants the friendship to develop into something more!)  Another character is the Ving Rhames-voiced social worker who oddly, is a big burly Man in Black type character.
Chaotic action towards the end of the film is a little bit of a let-down after the fun of the relationship between Lilo and Stitch and inevitably, the ending is a sentimental and happy one.Overall, Lilo and Stitch' is good fun and will win over audiences both old and young through the story's originality and the characters' charm.",7,6,7,27 October 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Exceeds what one might expect from a sequel
","The story will be familiar to followers of the series so far: a cyborg killing machine is sent back in time from a future where machines rule the Earth, to eliminate John Connor, the future rebel leader and saviour of humanity.  At the same time, a good Terminator' in the form of a T-101 model (i.e. Schwarzenegger) is sent back with the mission to keep Connor alive for the day when the Skynet system is due to launch its first attack on humanity.  This may sound mostly like a tiresome rerun of  Terminator 2' but apparently, Sarah and John Connor did not prevent Judgment Day in Terminator 2' they only postponed it!  Also, the twist and selling point here, is that this time the baddie' is T-X, a female supermodel Terminator' which is far superior to the T-101 (an obsolete model').Of the original main cast, only Arnie is back; Sarah Connor is dead as Linda Hamilton did not want to star in another sequel and Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl to play John Connor.  Another new face to the cast is Claire Danes who gives an appealing performance as the suitably bewildered and vulnerable girl destined to be John Connor's wife.  With a delay of twelve years since T2 Judgment Day' was released, Schwarzenegger's career on the decline and him revisiting the role for a third instalment, there is obviously a lot of pressure on this one to deliver the goods, and it certainly does.  Schwarzenegger is key to much of the fun of the film; his delivery of one-liners with robotic seriousness and Austrian accent is superb.  As a result, I found the film hilarious in parts.  At the start of the film, there is a re-run of two cyborgs being zapped back from the future nude and this makes for one of the funniest scenes in the film where a naked Arnie strides into Ladies night at a bar to be mistaken for a stripper by the raucous attendees.  He then steals the stage dancer's leather biker costume before trying on his star-shaped shades he off course soon ditches these for the by now familiar and way cooler black shades!  A lot of excitement is to be had from the film's action set-pieces and chases and this is down to the relentlessness of the T-X who like her predecessor, can shape herself into another human being and pull herself back together whatever gun you use to shoot at her.  Surprisingly, the ending is affecting as it reflects the inevitability of Connor's future role as a leader despite his reluctance to believe throughout.  Also, (I actually feel a bit silly for admitting it) I was unexpectedly moved by the scene where the T-101 struggles to override the corruption that the T-X has implanted in his program so that he alternates between conflicting missions of killer/protector of John Connor.I have to admit that I didn't totally get the plot and was a bit lost with regards the references to the Skynet system.  However, if you just go with the flow and don't think too much about the story, Terminator 3 makes for undemanding entertainment.",8,0,0,2 September 2003
Spider-Man," Cool!
","This is the big event movie' of the year very exciting because everyone has heard of Spider Man the comic book hero who started life as high school geek Peter Parker and became a crime-fighter after he was bitten by a radioactive spider.  The only previous comic book adaptations I have cared for are Superman' and Batman'.  I was never a comic book reader and I do not care whether these films bear any resemblance to the original comics. All I want is to be entertained and my only question before seeing this film was does it live up to the hype?  What makes Spider Man stand out from other big budget blockbusters is that time is spent on providing the background of the hero turning him into a character you can sympathise with and therefore one who is worth rooting for.  As Peter comes to terms with the idea that his wrists are capable of projecting a web-like substance and before he learns how to control his super-hero powers, he does what you or I would have learnt from watching cartoons as a kid you point your hands forward and shout Go web!'  At first, he is confused by the fact that his glasses suddenly makes his vision blurry and fascinated by his new muscular physique.Tobey Maguire in the lead role ups his hunk status and gives a likeable and endearing performance.  The love story of Peter's crush on his neighbour Mary Jane is sweet but never corny and this is credit to Kirsten Dunst who is both appealing and convincing in her role.  Willem Dafoe as the scientist Norman Osborn and his alter-ego, Green Goblin makes for an effective villain although I am still bewildered as to why Norman becomes the Green Goblin in the first place!Inevitably, there will be sequels to come and only time will tell whether these will become as tiresome as the Batman' sequels.  In the meantime, I suggest that you enjoy the original: Spider-Man' is great summer entertainment which successfully combines humour and action.",8,0,0,14 July 2002
Ocean's Eleven," Tasty cast in very cool and slick movie
","What a tasty prospect for a film: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Julia Roberts and for the young at heart amongst us, Joshua Jackson of 'Dawson's Creek' fame in a cameo role -all directed by the Oscar winning Steven Soderbergh!George Clooney plays Danny Ocean who soon after being released from prison, puts together a team of eleven to undertake a robbery of the three biggest casinos in Las Vegas in an attempt to bring in a reward of $150 million. What soon becomes clear is that it's not the money which will give Danny the ultimate satisfaction, but the opportunity to get revenge on the owner of the three casinos he is robbing -Benedict (Andy Garcia) who just happens to be the new beau of Danny's ex, Tess (Julia Roberts).Some of the gang of eleven are more memorable than others -especially the Chinese acrobat, the explosives expert with a dodgy cockney accent and the medallion wearing Reuben -aka Monica Gellar's dad!  The cast are brilliant at acting cool -even if all Brad Pitt is doing is snacking on the screen (he does this a lot!), you are still transfixed by him because he looks so good on screen.What makes the story so intriguing is the fact that Danny's mission seems so impossible: security in the casinos is paramount and the route to the reward is littered with obstacles.  The number of close calls that the gang is faced with is great fun and one can't help but root for these crooks throughout the film.  It is also refreshing to watch a film which is dominated by male stars and is not filled with macho swearing.  Instead, we have a banter between the stars which is indicative of their camaraderie.'Ocean's Eleven' is a welcome option in the choice of movies available at the moment which is dominated by Oscar nominees that are not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  With this film, it's simply a case of sit back and enjoy the fun!",8,67,80,5 March 2002
8 Mile," One for rap fans
","Eminem plays aspiring rapper Jimmy (nickname Rabbit') who lives in a trailer in Detroit with his mother (Kim Basinger) and his little sister. The story of 8 Mile' is pretty uneventful.  When we first meet Rabbit', he has just broken up with his girlfriend but he soon finds new romance in the form of Brittany Murphy.  We see him hanging out with his buddies and by day, he works at a steel pressing plant while trying to build up the nerve to compete in the rap duels' which take place at the local club.  Although Rabbit' has the raw talent, his nerves get the better of him at his first attempt and he freezes when he is passed the microphone while an all black audience heckles him.The lead role is one which is hardly going to stretch Eminem but he does give a credible performance and I emerged from the cinema liking him a bit more than when I went in.  8 Mile' is a very well acted film but I did not find it a great film.  This is one which will be enjoyed more by rap fans.  During the rapping scenes, I felt like I would have benefited if the speed of the lyrics were either slowed down or printed on the screen as subtitles.  Also, the ending was a little abrupt which for me took away the sense of personal triumph which Rabbit' must have been feeling.",6,0,1,12 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Style over substance
","Uma Thurman is The Bride, an assassin whose wedding day is ambushed by her former colleagues.  She is left comatose by a bullet in her skull but she wakes four years later intent on revenge.  She makes a death list': number five is Bill, but first there are some others including O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu) to deal with.The film starts promisingly with The Bride calling in at the house of a fellow assassin (Vivica Fox).  This is the most entertaining sequence of the film with some trademark Tarantino-esque banter between the two women as they fight.My interest in the film disintegrated soon after with a lengthy sequence that introduces O-Ren Ishi and is entirely in the form of a Manga style subtitled cartoon.  I am still not sure whether the film sent me to sleep because after that, I have no recollection of a coherent storyline.  A flashback to The Bride's escape from hospital is mildly amusing but in a very black way.   There is also a lengthy black and white sequence for the confrontation between The Bride and O-Ren Ishi's bodyguards.  Here, I felt like I was watching a very violent computer game with lots of fighting and blood spurting from dismembered bodies.  As is conventional with Tarantino films, the sequences are not chronological which makes Kill Bill' quite a frustrating film to watch.  Although I find Uma Thurman a very watchable actress, what this movie is lacking in is the witty banter between characters that made Pulp Fiction' and Jackie Brown' more enjoyable.Volume 1 ends with an intriguing piece of information being revealed in anticipation of the story being continued in Volume 2.  Perhaps I would like Kill Bill' more and my opinion would be different if I were to view Volume 2 on its release.  Unfortunately, at this stage, I feel that the six year wait for a new film by Tarantino has hyped up the film more than it deserves and I increasingly feel that he is an overrated director so much so that I am inclined to wait until I can borrow the two disc DVD from someone.",4,1,2,6 December 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Yet another triumph over adversity tale
","'A Beautiful Mind' tells the real-life story of mathematics professor and genius John Nash who also suffers from schizophrenia.  Included in this account is John's time spent at Princeton University where he chooses to skip classes entirely in pursuit of an original idea with which to make his name.  Thus, we see John spending much of his time scribbling complex mathematical formulae on the windows of his room and the university library.Despite his illness, John's work eventually results in him being awarded the Nobel Prize.  After leaving Princeton, he accepts a couple of assignments which involve code breaking for the government, one of these being provided by the mysterious Parcher (Ed Harris).  As he undertakes this assignment, John is filled with paranoia as his condition of schizophrenia becomes more apparent to his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and the audience.Although 'A Beautiful Mind' doesn't make for light entertainment, there is some humour to be found.  John's lack of social skills is evident in the way he handles women and his frankness in confessing to them that he would like to undertake intercourse as soon as possible as part of his chat up is quite endearing.  John's room mate Charles also provides welcome comic relief in the film's few lighter moments.One downside of the story telling in the film is the skipping of several years at a time which may leave you wondering what's been missed out in the account of this man's life (the upside is that the passing of time is accompanied by very convincing make-up!).  The end of the film seems a little rushed in the way John seems to make remarkable progress in his recovery and the fact that his wife sticks by him during his prolonged mental illness is a little unconvincing.A film dealing with mental illness is never going to be comfortable viewing but the fact that the film is based on a true life story does make it fascinating to watch.  What impressed me the most is the first class acting on display: the two leads Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly produce engaging and Oscar-worthy performances which are at times heartbreaking. In fact, Crowe could quite possibly be the new Tom Hanks in his ability to gain yet another Oscar nomination.",7,0,1,3 March 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," If you enjoy the book, you'll enjoy the film; otherwise don't bother
","Not a fan of the Harry Potter franchise, I really did not want to see this film.  My boyfriend on the other hand was itching to see it.  Being the generous hearted person that I am, I bought two tickets for him as a present and accompanied him to the cinema.My feeling is that if you enjoy the books, you'll enjoy the films which are basically an on-screen illustration of the book.  The success of the film depends on the viewer having seen the original or at least be familiar with the story so far from reading the Philosopher's Stone'.
The Chamber of Secrets' has its moments with some memorable scenes (Ron Weasley vomiting slugs; the flying car scene and another Quidditch chase). The special effects are also good; Dobby the house elf is an impressive creation whose computer-generated animation integrates convincingly with the live action.  Julie Walters as Ron Weasley's mother and Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart  are perfectly cast and provide a lot of the fun in the film.  To me, where the film is lacking is in the child leads I just cannot bring myself to care about what happens to them.So, having watched two of the Harry Potter films, I'm afraid to say that I'm still not a converted fan of the series.  I fail to see the charm of the stories that seems to captivate readers and viewers in the thousands and actually find the whole Harry Potter concept boring.  This feeling is accentuated by the fact that the film is over two hours long which in my opinion is way too long for a kids film.",5,1,2,9 February 2003
Love Actually," Another feel-good offering from Curtis. I actually like Four Weddings and a Funeral' and Bridget Jones' Diary' more
","The film is set in the five weeks leading up to Christmas and consists of a number of love stories affecting people who are related to characters in the other stories: a best man (Andrew Lincoln) is inexplicably hostile to his friend's new wife; the British Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) falls in love with his tea lady (Martine McCutcheon); his sister (Emma Thomson) is faced with her husband (Alan Rickman) having an affair at work; Alan Rickman's colleague (Laura Linney) finds her long term crush and love for another colleague requited; a widowed father (Liam Neeson) helps his son cope with falling in love for the first time; a writer (Colin Firth) escapes to France after being cheated on by his wife and finds new love; and an aging rocker (Bill Nighy) aims to make Christmas Number One in the pop charts with a cover of Love Is All Around' only the lyrics have been changed to Christmas Is All Around'.  (Astonishingly, this song has been released for real in the UK and made the top 40!)If you enjoyed Richard Curtis's previous offerings Four Weddings And A Funeral' and Notting Hill', you will not be disappointed by Love Actually' which is fun, likeable and romantic, if a little formulaic.  Hugh Grant gets another starring role in a Curtis movie and gives an endearing performance as the British Prime Minister.  I like him a lot but I am sure that there are some people out there who will be irritated to find him in typical bumbling mode (yet again!)It is a joy to see the abundance of British stars on the screen and it is fun to spot the additional television stars including British television presenters of the moment Ant and Dec!  My favourite moment is one I'm sure many of the British public have been faced with at some point in their lives when Bill Nighy refers to one of the presenters as Ant or Dec' as he has no idea which is which!  Other comic highlights include Hugh Grant dancing in the hallway at Number Ten and the language barrier between Colin Firth and his maid in France even though they are unable to speak each other's language, the subtitles on the screen show that they are communicating even if they are not aware of it.  The chemistry between these two is irresistible but is let down by the silly way that their story is resolved.While the film is filled with likeable performances, there is one piece of casting which let Liam Neeson's story down.  His son is cute but he sounds far too posh and well spoken for me to feel sympathy for his situation!Alongside the humour, there are some unexpected serious moments which I think over tip the balance and sit uncomfortably in a mostly lighthearted comedy.  One of these is the discovery that Laura Linney's new love is jeopardised by her commitment to her mentally ill brother.  Emma Thomson's realisation that her husband is cheating on her is also heartbreaking.  You have these serious undercurrents on the one hand and on the other you have a couple of silly stories: one featuring Kris Marshall leaving his life in London for Wisconsin in search of beautiful girls and rampant sex and another featuring Martin Freeman (Tim from The Office') as a porn body double having getting to know you' conversations while engaging in various sexual positions with his naked co-star.Love Actually' is like a book of short stories and suffers in the same way: by the time you get into the stories and you are just starting to get to know the main character, it is time to move on to a completely new story which is sometimes less interesting.  However, it makes for an enjoyable and romantic enough date movie and is Christmassy enough to warrant repeat viewings on DVD and television over festive seasons to come.",7,0,2,9 January 2004
Vanilla Sky," To like or not to like?
","Vanilla Sky reunites 'Jerry Maguire's director Cameron Crowe and star Tom Cruise.  There is hype before the film's release because its making seemingly brought about the romance between the two main stars Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz.Tom Cruise plays David, a rich and successful owner of a magazine publishing company who meets and falls for Sofia (Penelope Cruz), his best friend's guest at his party.  He promptly dumps his 'f**k buddy', Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) who actually believes herself to be a real girlfriend and starts stalking him.  A move which David must regret is when he gets into Julia's car with her, not realising that she is just a little annoyed at being discarded.  The result is a horrific car accident which leaves him badly disfigured and experiencing events which he can't be sure are real or imaginary.  Kurt Russell plays a psychologist who tries to help David figure out whether what he remembers are dreams or reality and it is mainly through David's interviews with his psychologist that the audience is presented with flashbacks of events.Such is Cruise's superstar status that one feels he can take risks by accepting non-mainstream roles such as this -he spends a significant part of the film disfigured or wearing a latex mask.  No doubt, many people who go and see this movie will be disappointed by this fact but nevertheless, you still get to see that winsome trademark grin and Cruise manages to evoke sympathy through his character's confusion and torment.  Penelope Cruz is charming as Cruise's love interest and the chemistry between the two stars is evident on the screen.Events after the car crash are extremely confusing but stick with it and you will be enlightened by an explanation towards the end of the film which has a tinge of science fiction about it.  Although I was utterly confused, I was still intrigued and interested in the characters and what on earth was happening.  'Vanilla Sky' is certainly a thought provoking and memorable film but is also a film which I still can't decide whether I like or not. Thinking about it some more, I'm tending towards liking it.  After all, I am a Tom Cruise fan and he proves once again here, that he's not just a pretty face.",6,0,0,29 January 2002
Signs," M Night Shyamalan fans will not be disappointed (except perhaps by the ending)
","Mel Gibson plays Graham Hess, a man who lives on a farm with his two young children and brother (Joaquin Phoenix).  One day, the news headlines on television reveal that large crop circles have appeared around the world (one of these has appeared right outside the Hess' house!)  The world speculates that there are only two possible explanations: either it is a hoax or signs of an alien invasion.  We also find out that Graham Hess was previously a priest but lost faith when his wife died.  The events in the film cause him to embark on a voyage of discovery which helps him regain his faith by the end.Having been a fan of M Night Shyamalan's two previous films The Sixth Sense' and Unbreakable', I was eager to check out his latest offering. This director has a very distinctive style which is again apparent in Signs': he uses strong child actors; takes time in the story-telling; focuses on only a small number of characters and there is a flashback sequence in the final reel.  Part of the fun of his films is also looking out for the director's cameo appearance!  It is a style which I find very effective but I do know some people who have found the build-up to his stories too slow and uninteresting.The two male leads give engaging and subtle performances.  The child actors are also good; they are never irritating and very believable this comes as a surprise considering the son is played by one of the Culkin brothers! I found the story both suspenseful and engrossing.  It is also quite a scary film in places going for suggestion of what cannot be seen in the shadows rather than in-your-face' scares.  All the audience gets for most of the film is strange noises on an old baby monitor and glimpses in reflections on a kitchen knife and the television set.  There is a sense of the family being in real isolation with their link to the outside world being provided only really by news updates on television while outside there is an unexplained presence which is made more threatening by a picture of a house in flames in the son's extra-terrestrial textbook which looks eerily like the Ness' home.The only let-down in the film is perhaps the ending which gave me the sense that the director couldn't be bothered with anything fancy this time round. Without giving too much away I can only describe the ending as being too convenient.",8,0,1,21 September 2002
Donnie Darko," This film did my head in!
","Donnie Darko is the name of the teenage hero of the film.  One night, a jet engine falls from the sky and lands through the roof of the Darkos' home no one knows where from and Donnie encounters a rabbit-headed figure, Frank who informs him that the world is coming to an end in twenty eight days.Days pass accompanied by more bizarre events which builds up the audience's anticipation of what will happen when the time runs out.  We learn early on in the film that Donnie is taking medication which hints that day to day episodes may be tricks in Donnie's mind.  What makes the film stimulating is the fact that you cannot be sure whether events are real or the result of Donnie's state of mind.You get the sense that throughout the film, Donnie is a trapped soul (whether it be in a time warp or a dream I can't decide) where teachers and adults such as the Patrick Swayze guru character want to simplify everything in life into two extremes: fear and love.  You also have Drew Barrymore as Donnie's English teacher who invites the new girl of the class to sit next to the boy she finds the cutest.  The romance which develops between Donnie and his new classmate is nice and helps to lighten the tone of what has already developed into a pretty dark film.  Jake Gyllenhaal gives a likeable performance as the hero and displays good comic timing and laidback personality he reminds me of Tobey Maguire in many ways.  He is not an actor I am familiar with but he looks to be a promising future star.I went to the cinema seeking a film that would be unpredictable what better film to choose than a film where a boy meets a human-sized rabbit and the world is meant to end in less than thirty days.  When the 28 days of the story had run out, I was left with no logical explanation to what I had seen.  I left the cinema very confused, this film did my head in!",6,0,0,2 November 2002
