Come and See," 'Come and See' is a Soviet war movie about and occurring during the Nazi German occupation of the Byelorussian SSR in 1943.
","Come and See is a look at World War II from the Soviet side. The movie takes place through the eyes of a 13-year-old boy named Florya, who joins the partisans to fight with Russian partisans in Belarus, when the Nazis torched over 600 villages and slaughtered their people in 1943. Come and See is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. It does prove that a great war movie doesn't necessarily need to have over the top special effects or production budget. A very powerful movie that makes you feel and sense what goes on in wars. It does touch on the reality of what war brings into people's lives and its affects on their behavior and decision makings. A combination of great directing and acting makes the film so interesting that we feel like we're actually in the war zone.",9,1,1,12 December 2011
