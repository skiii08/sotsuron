The New World," Exercise in editing
","Too many reaction shots. If I had to see one more sweeping ,over the shoulder as they look towards camera, shot of someone making a face, I was going to scream. Over-scored (as are many Hollwood films) I don't need a dramatic soundtrack to punctuate the sorrow of the battle between Indians and English. I get it. This film could be clipped down to an hour and fifteen. This was my first time at the movies where I actually heard snoring from two separate moviegoers on either side of me. Film looked beautiful, but lacked in movement of story. Terrence Malick takes his films way too seriously. Pounds viewers over the head with forced emotion and is relentless in narration.",3,1,8,12 February 2006
