The Blair Witch Project," The scariest film I have ever seen
",Literally. Any sense of humor melts away after the first 20 minutes of this film. The perspective of viewing the 'footage' as if I was there makes for sheer nail-biting suspense. I was gripping the seat. My friend who attended was clutching his chest. The morning after I felt like I'd had a nightmare. Can my sanity stand to see it again?,10,1,3,1 May 1999
The Mummy," Good SFX makes not one a Mummy
","Yawn. Uh, in the land of Pharohs, Mummy's, nubile concubines and buried treasure, can the term uninspired apply? When it comes to The Mummy, the answer is: YES. For sheer mindless entertainment, The Mummy will hold you for a while, but don't expect any return trips to this curse of a flick. Boris Karloff would be rolling in his tomb. Cheers to the great special effects, but I couldn't help but feel I was watching a giant comic. Cheesy one-liner jokes, not-so-subtle jabs at 'smelly' Egyptians, and not enough dead corpses in bandages. The Mummy himself regenerates too quickly, I'd rather see him in continual decay throughout the film. Goofy love story subplot, and I'm talking about the 'living' characters. Only thing that help my attention was the sexy bald Imhotep (The Mummy pre-embalming and post resurrection) in his loin cloths. The Mummy likes to open his mouth a lot in the movie, whether to release a swarm of flies or a plague of locusts; maybe he needs a check-up. Can't wait for the Saturday morning cartoon.",5,0,0,8 May 1999
Troy," There is a reason epics are scarce
","Because only a good one is made every decade or so. This is the most tedious, preposterous piece of crap I have seen in a long time. It raises Titanic to new heights of greatness. TROY has the feel of a made-for-TV mini-series. Had it been on TV I would have skipped it all together. Pitt is pitiful, he should stick to quirky tweaked out manic weirdos. His mistress in the film said it best towards the miserable end 'How long will this go on?' I kept looking at my watch and one hour into the film it already felt like it had been running nearly 2 hours. None of the fine actors in this film can save it. Perhaps in a few years it will become a camp classic because of some of the tedious and stupid dialog. This film could have been cut to 2 hours and tightened up. Lots of irrelevant scenes of nothing.",1,3,8,16 May 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A great return for Star Wars. Lucas knows how to have fun!
","**(notice: a few spoilers)Star Wars has always held a special place for me. In 1977 my mom took my brother and I out of summer camp early one afternoon to take us to see Star Wars. While I grew out of the obsessiveness with all things Star Wars, the series still maintains a firm hold on my imagination.
Yes, Phantom let me down slighty, as did parts of Jedi in their sapiness. Clones has helped me put the magic of Star Wars back into perspective. I think the movie speaks more of Lucas as a director and person than any of the others. It exemplifies 'Saturday matinee serial'.The 'film' is overwhelming. I look foward to a second viewing to take it all in. Lucas pays homage to so many genres: Spaghetti westerns, 50's Sci-Fi, and film noir. At times the movie took on elements reminicent of the 40's, with sound effects from propeller planes, as well as the costumes and hairstyles. I loved the diner scene with Obi-wan; definitely an 'American Graffiti' moment.The special effects are seamless, and so fluid. Compared to Spiderman, Lucas has utilised the CGI to much more believable effect. I saw the Digital Light Projection version at the AMC 1000 (the only one in Northern California). I would like to see the film version for comparison. At first was couldn't understand the difference, but soon realised the image is incredibly clear, no glitches, pops, frame drops. The movie was introduced by a manager of the theater explaining that this is how Lucas intended for the movie to be seen. The audio is spectacular too, with explosions that rattle the seats.I felt that the political aspects of the story were better developed in this episode than in the previous movies. While most of the acting is mediocre, I wasn't looking for or expecting more. Portman is better and more sincere in Clones than in Phantom. Christopher Lee is brilliant; how could he be otherwise. Lucas gives some nice nods to the Hammer films, surrounding Lee with Gothic images and dark effects. I do feel that the original cast of Ford, Fisher, and Hammill had a chemistry that hasn't been repeated in Phantom or Clone. Perhaps it was the newness of what they were doing in the late 70's, having been involved in something that broke so much ground in terms of film. Lucas is not necessarily an actor's director, but a facilitator for an amazing fantasy world.The movie is filled with foreshadowing, and many references to scenes in the other episodes; especially IV: New Hope. Things can only get darker (and more fun) from here.",9,1,2,19 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Free your mind, you are gonna need it.
","What can I say? 10:30pm screening, and it's 2hrs 45min movie. Yawn. I mean...yay! The special effects are so good, I forgot just how special they are. Paves the way for the next one...yeah whatever. Fun. Long. Stimulants are probably advisable. I found more pleasure in movie escapism in X-Men 2 than the Matrix. The special effects in X-Men are believable. The special effects in Matrix are just so constant, they are unbelievable. There really isn't any element of surprise, just wow-in-your-face kick-ass effects. The story...well whatever we all know what's gonna happen...it's our destiny.",6,0,0,16 May 2003
