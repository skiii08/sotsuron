The Devil's Advocate," For lawyers.
","I watched this film for the first time when I was in high school. At that time I can't understand the whole meaning of the script. 4 years later I watched this film, but I had already been in the university and studied law.

","This film opens new trilogy in the Star Wars Universe that tells about life's path of Anakin Skywalker. I think that this film is the worst one of prequals. Firstly, the plot is good but sometimes some scenes take too much time and it looks very boring. Secondly, the cast and characters are great, Darth Maul is one the best villain in all saga. But Ja Ja Binks is one of the most annoying character (expecting main characters in new trilogy). Thirdly, the visual effects are wonderful, of course, they are much better than in the first film.
So, this film has a lot of good moments and a lot of disadvantages.",7,1,1,14 May 2020

","Two previous films about Thor weren't good, these films were boring and dark. After changing the director to Taika Waititi, the situation turns to 180 degrees.

","All expested a lot from this film, trailer looked awesome, but the film has some problems. Firstly, the plot is good, it shows the squad of criminals with dome superpowers or big abilities. Some acts of characters are illogical, and can't be understood. Secondly, the cast is great, all actors are wonderful, Margo Robbie is a brilliant of film. But some characters don't have any explanation. Joker is supporting character, and I don't understand it. Thirdly, the visual effects are good.

Interstellar," Masterpiece.
","If you love space theme, you dream about journey through universe, this film is for you. Firstly, the plot is mind-blowing, actually I don't expect anything lese because the director of film if genius Christopher Nolan. One of the favourite aspect in his film is time issue. This film solve the time problem from another side if it is compared with Inception. The drama and tradegy are also perfectly shown. Secondly, the cast is brilliant, I don't want to highlight someone because all actors and actresses shown the great performance despite of main character or supporting role. Thirdly, visual effects are wonderful, I don't recommend watch this film on little screen. I had feeling that I was on that spaceship when I watched the film.
So, it's one of genius work from great master of cinema.",10,0,0,28 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The murder of franchise.
","It had to be the great film, because it was the end of Skywalker's saga, that continued for 40 years. I don't know what was in the head of screenwriters, but it is the worst film in all Star Wars ever. Of course, the visual effects is great, music is a awesome too, because author is genius John Williams. That's all good features if this film. There are a lot of illogical moments from the beginning to the rinal fight. The film tried to use old characters like Palpatine and princess Organa for taking interest of fans, but they forgot, that the fans are very sensitive to canon of saga
So, it's average Disney film that connected with Star Wars.",6,10,17,16 April 2020

The Godfather: Part II," Best sequel.
","Sometimes sequels had worse quality than original film. But this is not that case. It's one of the best sequel ever. Firstly, the story told in interesting way, actually there are two stories in one film but it had common thing: way of standing as Godfather. I think that the lifeway of Vito is forced one, as for Michael's one - it was his one choice. Secondly, the cast is wonderful, Robert De Niro showed Vitp perfectly, sometimes he looks like Marlon Brando in young age. Of course, Al Pacino's work is great too, his face without any emotions is legendary. Finally, the soundtrack, that was created by Nino Rota, finished the atmosphere of film.
So, it's one of the greatest sequel and film ever.",10,0,2,14 April 2020
Justice League," Something strange.
","I think this film had a lot of problems from the beginning to the end. The change of director killed amazing film. Firstly, the plot has a lot of gaps and non-answered questions. You can see the phrase: 'You can't save the world alone' on the poster. In fact, Superman save the world alone, and he doesn't need any help. Why we don't see Darkseid at all? Story of Cyborg almost isn't shown. Secondly, the cast is only one thing that is really goof, Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck, Jason Momoa and others are wonderful. Thirdly, the visual effects also have a lot problems (moustache of Superman).
So, I wait for announced Snydercut.",6,0,0,30 May 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Wonderful fantasy.
","I don't read the original book so I can rate the film itself (without comparison with book). First, yhe story is interesting, it has a lot of characters with different attributes. The world os very big that contains with a lot of different creatires from myths and legends. This fact makes film very interesting to follow. It has some moral that friendship and peace are more important thing that power. Secondly, the cast is great, I don't want to highlight someone, but all of them (especially old ones) are great in their performance. Thirdly, the atmosphere of film is made by music and background (if remember that it's real nature of New Zealand).
So, it's one the greatest fantasy film ever.",9,0,0,5 May 2020
The Patriot," War and peace.

Secondly, the cast is great, Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger show great father and son. Jason Isaacs, as usually, plays the antagonist. Thirdly, the action itself looks great.
So, it's good action film with great actors.",9,1,1,16 May 2020
Now You See Me," Magic or crime?
","After seeing so many negative reviews about this film, I was very surprised. As for me, the film is amazing, the plot is the best part of this film. Acting is so high: the stunning Duo of Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg and Mark Ruffalo in the lead role do not let the audience get bored.",9,1,2,13 February 2020
Yesterday," Nice comedy.
","This film is like a breath of fresh air. I don't like romance comedy but this film is really good. Firstly, the story is interesting, you as viewer appeared in the world without some ordinary things. Globally nothing was changed, but for someone this changes are global. Also the film shows that some music is immortal and popular in all time but big money can mess every music even legendary. Secondly, the cast is good, appearence of Ed Sheeran is jewel of film.
So, it's good comedy with a little bit unsuspecting end.",7,1,2,23 April 2020
Avengers: Endgame," We are in the Endgame now.

Firstly, the story is amazing, the screenwriters did the great work, despite of 3 hours, no moments looks very long or boring. Twisted moments happen in the right place, most of actions of characters are logical. The authors have big attention to little details and 'easters' due the film. Secondly, the cast is awesome, so many characters of comics together were the first time in the history. Some characters' lines ends, and this finish looks great (Iron Man and Captain America). Thirdly, the visual effects is wonderful.
So, it's one of greatest oan biggest film ever.",10,3,13,16 April 2020
Twilight," Romance with mystery.
","This film could be good romance film with dome mystery aspects. Really, it has some problems and it's the reason of low rate. Firstly, the plot is good, it shows love between vampire and ordinary girl. The problem of film is bad and sometimes stupid dialogues. Secoy, the cast is very controversial. Robert Pattinson is very talented actor, and he did his work perfectly. Kristen Stewart is pale, I didn't see any emotions on her face. Others are good.
So, it's romance film with some problems with dialogues and actors' play.",6,0,0,30 May 2020
The Princess Bride," Good fairytale.
","It's suitable for family evening. Firstly, the plot is interesting, you have 2 different lines: grandpa and the boy, who become closer during the tale, and the story about beautiful princess and hero who must save the princess. The plot is quite predictable but it can also advantage, it's veru warm and old-fashioned. Secondly, the cast is good, especially supporting actors they are very memorable.
So, it's good family movie for all ages.",7,0,0,14 May 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Genius Tarantino.
","All films that were directed by Tarantino have own charms and special features. Thos film is not exception. Director wanted to show atmosphere of old Hollywood, the place where he grown.

Schindler's List," One if the best film ever.
","I'm from Russia, and for all russian people theme of WWII is very important because 27 millions Soviet people died at this war. We have a lot of good or even perfect films about it. I think this film is very popular in my country because it tries to show the madness of nazism, the inhumane of fascism. Firstly, the plot of this film is interesting because it based on real story about man who tries to save lifes despite of fact that he could be killed for this. Secondly, the cast is wonderful, all actors did their work perfectly regardless of the amount of screen time. Of course, the pair of two brilliant actors: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes did one if the best performance. At the film they have a kind of psychological duel. Thitdly, the atmosphere of film is made by colour decision and music. The end of film can leave you in the tears.
So, it's one of the best film ever.",10,0,1,27 April 2020
The Lion King," Not the same.
","After watching thus film I didn't understand why I have a feeling that it's not the same quality as in original animation. Now I understand ut. They usee new technology, and animals looks very similar to their nature look. But 'The lion king' is about emotions. If animals looks like real one, you can't see all emotions on their muzzles, you lose part of range of emotions.
So, it's one of the infinity number of remakes that lost part of their magic.",8,0,1,7 May 2020
1917," Awesome
","I'm from Russia, we have a lot films about World War II but there are very little number if films, books ot anything belse about World War I. It's explained by Soviet policy, they named this war 'imperialism' one and did all to forget it. Nowadays we only begin to explore this tragedy.
If my friends or family ask me to recommend a film about WWI, I recommend this one. Firstly, the story is great. It looks very simple (just story about one episode if WWI) but it's really catchy, because it's rarely when fims shown life of ordinary soldiers. Secondly, the atmosphere of war is shown great, you see a lot injuries, blood, dirt and pain. Thirdly, the cast did the amazing performance, two main characters perfored real friendship in war. Finally, the great work of camera operator, film looks like one-shot one.
So, it's great film, one of the best of 2019.",10,1,4,12 April 2020
The Dark Knight," Not a typical superhero film.
","I'm not a professional critic, I'm just simple viewer of films. I don't understand the difficult lines or hidding meaning of film, but I do understand film is good or not. All Batman's trilogy of Christopher Nolan is wondrous, but the best film from best trilogy is this one. Firstly, the story is really interesting, Nolan created his own script that only connected with basic comics. Secondly, the cast is the best part if this film. Cristian Bale did the great work, I can see all emotions and inner experience of him. But the real brilliant is Heath Ledger, his Joker is the best character on this film, and the best enemy in the cinema ever. Thirdly, the visual effects creates the dark atmosphere of Gotham.
So, it's one of the best action film evere.",10,0,2,21 April 2020
Midsommar," Hard to understand.
","This film is something between good art house and horror movie. Firstly, the story is very simple, but from another side it's very complicated. It connects with ancient Scandinavian myths and tradition. This film has also some psychological aspect that connects with past of main character. Secondly, the cast is quite goos, Florence Pugh is a brilliant actress. Thirdly, the visual aspect is wonderful, the scenes looks beautiful. The disadvantage of this film is fact that it's very difficult to understand meaning of what happens.
So, it's good art house film with beautiful visual aspect.",7,1,9,26 April 2020
Titanic," Good romance.
","Titanic is iconic film from different points of view. Firstly, the plot is interesting, it shows passengers' fates before the catastrophe. It shows that love doesn't understand social differences.

Secondly, the cast os great, children are beautiful, bit adult actors and actresses are the brilliants of film: Meggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Richard Harris and so on. Thirdly, Cgi looks wonderful despite of the fact that film was created in 2001.

Joker," The king.
","This film took a lot of attention, especially after winning the main award at Venice festival. When I went to the cinema I expected good film. After watching it I can say that the film exceeded my expectations. Firstly, the story is interesting to follow, it's a way of man who transforms from just the looser to one of the most dangerous man in Gotham. I really like the fact that the reason of becoming Joker is different than in the comics. It looks more realistic that Joker is a product if society than the falling into chemicals. Secondly, the actor's performance is wonderful. Joaquin Phoenix did the great work, his Joker doesn't cause any sympathy. The appearance of Robert De Niro highlights that the authors inspired by film 'Taxi Driver'. Thirdly, the atmosphere of dark, depressive Gotham created by operator's work, wonderful music and costume's designer.
So, it's one of the best film of our time.",10,1,5,24 April 2020
It Chapter Two," A little bit boring.
","The first film was really good and like a breath of fresh air. I waited the sequel woth impatience. After watching Chapter Two, I was a little bit disappointed. Firstly, the plot is good, it continues the story. The idea was great, but this film should be scary. The sequel isn't scary at all, I can say that it's funny but not scary. Secondly, the cast is the best part of film, all actors did their work perfectly. Thirdly, the visual effects are good.
So, it's good family film, but not a horror.",7,0,0,12 June 2020
Inception," Mind-blowing film.
","If you watch this film, you will understand why Christopher Nolan is called 'genius'. This film is really mind-blowing. Firstly, the story is told in intersting way, the scenes didn't gi in the line, it's like a puzzle, that you should solve. Secondly, the cast is awesome, Leonardo DiCaprio had to win Oscar for this role. Another actors are wonderful, as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tom Hardy did the great performance. Thirdly, visual effects are wonderful, sometimes you don't understand how it works, and this is great feeling.

The Shawshank Redemption," Film no. 1 in the world.
","Many years I didn't understand why this film is the top rated on IMDb because I didn't watch it. When I did it I wouldn't have any questions. You watch the film and you believe this story.

So this film is really the best in the world.",10,0,1,2 April 2020
Parasite," Korean phenomen
","I watched this film after the latest Oscar ceremony but I didn't expect a lot from this film. So, I was really surprised. Firstly, the story is really interesting, it seems very simple but you will be a little bit shocked after middle of the film. The plot has some good twisted moments. Secondly, all cast showed the great performance, I believed them. Thirdly, I want to line cameraman's work, the frames looks awesome. I think that some scenes are too long, it's a reason why I didn't rate it more than 8.
So, it's wonderful film about our society, family values and, at the end, love.",8,2,4,8 April 2020
Tombstone," Amazing western.
","This film is awesome. Firstly, the plot is great, it is based on real story that happens in the second half of 19th century, in the USA. It has a lot of guns, shooting and murders. Secondly, the cast is the best part of the film. Kurt Russell is great, he plays a man, who wants quite life but he can't live without adventures. I think, Doc is the best role of Val Kilmer, he looks awesome.
So, it's great western.",9,0,0,31 May 2020
The Greatest Showman," Amazing film.
","I like musical as genre, so I have watched a lot of ut. This film is really great. Firstly, the plot is great, it shows the life of one of the first producers, mr. Barnum, his ideas and his way to success. I like the storyline of young characters, and all love stories.

So, it's nice film for all family.",8,0,0,27 May 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Laugh in tragedy.
","It's very unusual movie. Often films about WWII can be divide in two groups: 1) serious, big films with moral, tradegy and drama; 2) comedies with a little bit stupid humour and a lot of gags. This film isn't in that groups. Firstly, the plot is genius, WWII shown by eyes of 10-years boy, who believes in Hitler like in God. He must choose: his belief or his friendship and love, and this cathes you all. Also drama and comedy alternate each other, it creates movement of plot. Secondly, the cast is great, I can say it about both generation of actors and actresses. Young cast did all performance well, especially the main character. Adult cast is brilliant of film. Sam Rockwell is the king of supporting role, and with Rebel Wilson they became stars of film. Scarlett Johansson is one of the best actress of our days, she played one the difficult role in this film - mother of Jojo. Of course, I must say about Hitler of Taika Waititi, you should watch it, it's very funny.
So, it's good film that found the balance between comedy and tragedy.",9,1,4,1 May 2020
Midway," Honour to heroes.
","This film can be used as a reminder to heroism acts of men and women who tokk part in WWII. Firstly, the plot is very interesting, it tells about Midway battle. It shows different sides of this event, I really like that the film shiws not only one side of conflict, also we can see Japanese army, and they are shown as good warriors too. Secondly, the cast is great, all actors look very similar to their prototypes and do their work excellent. Thirdly, the action itself is great, I had a feeling that I was in the plane or on the board of ship.
So, it's amazing war film.",8,1,2,13 June 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The great end of story.
","This film is great for many reasons. Firstly, the plot is great, and the story is told masterly. You as a viewer has a lot of characters' lines in different places. I really like the story of Aragorn, he is ine the strongest (about soul) person. I don't like Frodo , all film he just whines all the time. As for me, the real hero is Sam, his loyalty to Frodo and promise is amazing. Secondly, the cast is great, especially the old one. Thirdly, big battle scene is the best part, it's masterpiece.
So, it's big film with great battle film.",9,0,0,6 May 2020

","This film starts new era in cinematography. Firstly, the plot is interesting, it seems a little bit simple, but this type of films rarely has difficult story, especially the first one. Secondly, the cast is awesome, all actors did their work perfectly (my favourite is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. Thirdli, the main part if film is visual effects. When I read about history of making Star Wars, I was excited how much work authors did and how many new methods they used. Because of it Sci-Fi films went into new era.
So, it's one of the best sci-fi film ever.",9,0,0,14 May 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Big road-movie.
","I think this film is really overrated. Firstly, the plot is very simple, it doesn't have any specific moments or something like that. Secondly, the cast is great, Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are the brilliants of film. But! The film is called 'Mad Max', but Max in this film is supporting character, the main one is Furiosa. Thirdly, the action is wonderful, it was very difficult to make it because they almost used only real action (without computer technology).
So, it's good road-movie without good plot.",8,0,1,18 May 2020
The Godfather," One if the best film ever.
","I'n not the great critic, I'm just a person, who loves cinema. If you are like me, you must watch this film. All features in it are on their place. Firstly, the story is based on Mario Puso's book, I really recommend to read it, and this film used almost all book, expect the storyline about young Vito (director used it in sequel). Secondly, all actors did the amazing performance: Brando, Al Pachino, Duvall and others created great film. Thirdly, music and costumes made the atmosphere of late 40s.
So, it's really one of the greatest film ever.
