Requiem for a Dream," a movie about addiction that you will end up addicted to the movie
","before i wrote this review i realized that it already has almost 2000 reviews! so i have to be different, how? just by being simple and focusing on some points. the movie is about 4 persons 1-the mother 2- the son 3- his girl friend 4- the friend. all of them are drug addicts, and each one is trying to reach his or her dream. the mother wants to be in a show to tell about her son and her husband who died and she goes crazy in order to reach her dream, the son and his girl friend and their friend are doing nothing but trying to have their drug and take it. this is so real, this is what addicts lives are about, only trying to get the drug, take it and that's all. the movie is the best anti-drug movie ever made, the only default about the movie is that it sometimes look like a real show or a documentary or like a program and that somehow can make you bored, but in general it is a very real, touching and useful movie. at the end addiction ends in one of the following 1- you die 2- you go to jail 3- you go insane and lose your mind 4- you live your life only for your drug and in all cases you will lose your dream or you fail to reach it. the movie takes you in a journey first; you see how the first dose comes, second; you see how addiction comes, third; you see how is the addict life, thoughts and feelings finally; you watch how the addict ends up to.. but the movie does not give a solution or an idea for how to quit. but it alerts us to drugs and how it change lives and destroy it. i am an ex- addict an that's why i saw this movie one of the best. but it also suits other people not just addicts. don't miss it.",8,0,1,13 September 2012
