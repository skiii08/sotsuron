Iron Man 3," Entertainment at its peak :)
","I just finished watching this movie exactly 1 hour ago. Yes, the ending was not a fantastic complicated and absolutely mind blowing twist, but it was the ending that we all awaited, and Robert Downey didn't fail to deliver it beautifully. although the ending is somewhat expected, there are a few minor surprises throughout the movie, like when the mandarin just turns out to be an absolutely hilarious joke and a complete phony. the few comic lines that were splayed out in the movie did somewhat give it a light touch ( i especially liked that young kid aka potato gun kid). Gwyneth also plays her part beautifully, and i was touched when tony pulls his suit to protect her first :P All in all, it was a real joy watching this movie, it had that type of ending that just allows you to rest quietly knowing one of your favorite movies just ended well. highly recommended :D",8,2,9,2 May 2013
