3:10 to Yuma," Great Western For The New Age
","This was a great film; the acting was amazing, particularly that of Ben Foster; who portrays the ruthless Charlie Prince, and helps carry the film. Christian Bale does what he does best, he's versatile, and more than capable of handling any role thrown his way, and he carries out the character of Dan Evans with emotion and intensity often lost among today's big name actors. Russell Crowe brings masculinity and hardness to the character of Ben Wade, but also shows a sly, cool gunslinger who manages to win our hearts. And not to mention the relationship between Bale And Crowe is absolutely perfect. And we welcome to the big time Logan Lerman. And its always great to see Peter Fonda and Vinessa Shaw. Other westerns may have been before my time, and recent ones have failed, which is why this is a great western for the new age. For any fan of films and superb acting; this is definitely a film not to be missed.",8,1,2,23 September 2007
