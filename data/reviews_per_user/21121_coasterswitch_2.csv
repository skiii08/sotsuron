3:10 to Yuma," Good old fashion Western
",The best part of this western is Russel Crowe. He steals the movie from everyone else. Crowe's performance is enigmatic as he makes it cool to be an outlaw. From his mannerisms to his outfit he personifies a cool bad guy. He also makes his bad guy character intelligent too. Apart from Crowe; here is a terrific story. At the end of the day its about telling a story. This story is paced well and linear. The movie also provides a realness in its use of gun play and explosions. One cannot critique this movie without mentioning the performance of Ben Foster. He plays a more deranged bad guy than Crowe and without the charm but he does so in a mesmerizing fashion. 3:10 To Yuma is a great example of how a great Western can be and illustrates that they still can be made well today. I encourage everyone to see this movie. If you have never seen a Western this movie will make you a fan of the Western genre!,Null,1,2,28 October 2017
The Revenant," How can anyone not at least appreciate the quality of this movie
","I cannot believe the negative comments this movie has gotten. Just watched this for the second time and still find it marvellous.One of the best movies I have ever seen. Easily in my all time top ten. Best direction I can recall ever seeing in a movie. One of the best supporting actor performances (from Tom Hardy); I have ever seen. Cinematography is breathtaking. Wonderful story.I think perhaps those who did not like this movie, feel that a movie with overwhelming direction and cinematography can't possibly have a great story and great acting. This movie has everything in spades!",10,1,2,29 May 2017
