The Ring," definitely scary.
","i haven't been this freaked out by a movie since i saw 'silence of the lambs' at age 11.  if you haven't seen it yet and you know that you can be fairly disturbed by psychological thrillers, don't see this one.  you won't be sleeping well for a while.i'm a rational person, and i realize that a hollywood movie that relies on special effects shouldn't scare me like this.  nonetheless, i wish i hadn't seen it, and i wish i could sleep away from my TV tonight.good movie altogether.  although there were a few irritating plot holes, i was quite scared (and still am).",Null,0,0,24 November 2002
