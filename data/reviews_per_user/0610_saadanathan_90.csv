Kill Bill: Vol. 2," kind of disturbing 7\10
","I'ii be honest, I loved the film. the final scene when the bride and bill encounter each other is unforgetable. and the sequense with the master pai mei was great but a lot of scenes were gruesome and made me feel uncomfortable, I actually had to close my eyes on some occasion and that is not something that happenes so oftenly. but on the other hand it shows you how tarantino's writing can influence you and make you feel something. that is not an easy thing to do when you write a script. the acting was great, both david carradine and michael madsen nailed it.",7,0,1,17 April 2020
Vertigo," Awful 3/10
","I don't expect much from Hitchcock, so it's obvious that this picture would be the same. It seems Hitchcock is always ending his movies in a cliffhanger or a mindf*uk. But in this particular movie it doesn't seem to fit in, I can imagine the plot of the movie happening in another movie and it would be the same, nothing special or shocking. Also the acting was exaggerated. on a personal note: I'm not a fan of Hitchcock so I wasn't expecting to enjoy much but I still tried to watch the movie and see if I can appreciate this director but it seems that even if I understand the plot and the ending, I just don't love the movie nor the director. I guess Hitchcock is just not my type. the only lesson I can learn from him is 'the bomb under the table'.",3,1,6,4 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Rough start for the sequel trilogy 6/10
","So making a new trilogy of films that tells what happened prior to the original story fans have come to known can be a little tricky. Especially in this particular film. There are many defaults in the sequel trilogy that fans love to mock about and its understandable because there are many bad things in this trilogy I would have removed. But now lets focus on The Phantom Menace. There is a lot of talking and negotiations in the film until finally there are actions being taken by the characters. The final battle for example, took to long to happen and could have been pushed forward in the plot. The acting was fine I guess, only a few lines that became a joke in this galaxy. Example for bad writing. At last we have the famous lightsaber battle in every star wars film: Darth maul is a great character and he kicks ass in the sequence. Liam Neeson is good as always with his acting skills and Ewan McGregor is fantastic. Overall it is a solid film. The sequel trilogy started with left foot.",6,1,1,14 May 2020
The Equalizer," Great deadly movie 7/10
","Denzel Washington is the only reason this movie is not failing. In many cases this movie may seem simple and quite boring. Any other action movie could have been made like that, simple story and plot, no surprises nor twists. I've seen many of those kinds of movies before but 'The Equalizer' is beyond all that. It is intriguing and deadly. Denzel Washington delivers a fantastic performance and has most of the best lines in the movie. The fact that his character suffers from OCD is important cause the audience can identify with his character, see for themselves how he deals with his rivals and threats and how he finds a way to get out of every bad situation. One memorable sequence in the film is the one near the ending, the 'home malt' sequence where Denzel's character faces his enemies at the store and sets off traps, it is filmed so well that I had to appreciate every shot of that sequence, the water dropping from the sealing on his face. Every moment from that sequence was intriguing and awesome. 'The Equalizer' is another good movie by Antoine Fuqua and I wish to see more of Denzel's character in the future.",7,0,0,30 June 2020
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Snakes... why does it have to be snakes? 7/10
","I grew up watching all 'Indiana Jones' movies and had a wonderful time watching them. I don't know why but 'raiders of the lost ark' wasn't my favorite, although this one was perfect, really perfect. Steven Spielberg doing an amazing job with the directing, the score composed by John Williams is too iconic to ignore, Harrison Ford is awesome and there were a lot of great scenes.",7,0,0,15 May 2020
Spartacus," Spectacular movie 7/10
","'Spartacus' is an amazing movie. Along with other movies such as The Ten Commandments and 'Cleopatra'. They all have features in common: they have massive amounts of stunts and film locations, they are huge movies with amount of production and they all tell interesting and fascinating stories of human history. Today you won't see any massive production like this in Hollywood because everything is made with CGI and green screen. Back in the day it was a revolutionary, that's what makes Spartacus so well appreciated and fascinating. The story is really good. A slave becomes a leader of a big rebellion against the Roman empire. Kirk Douglas is an amazing actor and he does a fabulous job in the portrayal of the heroic character. The score was beautifully composed. The cinematography is probably the main reason this film is so well appreciated and I admit, it is fantastic.",7,1,1,12 June 2020
It," Horror is the name 7/10
","'It' is a terrifying experience that all Steven King fans should watch. It is scary, creepy, you name it. Bill Skarsgard is doing a fantastic job as the clown 'Pennywise'. The cast of young actors was great. So many talented actors in one film that will soon become stars. The young cast and the story reminded me of 'Goonies' or 'Stranger things' only scarier of course. The more funny scenes are the ones with the kids, Ritchie and Eddie are a great duo and have good lines throughout the movie. The more terrifying parts of the movie are when the characters are facing their fears and pennywise. All in all a great scary movie. A horror one to be correct.",7,0,0,21 June 2020
John Wick," John wick - the new chuck Norris of cinema 8/10
",This action packed film is one of the best in recent years. Although it is quite insane for a man to go on a revenge quest like this. It does serve the audience and gives them what they want to see the most - Keanu Reeves kicking ass!. The movie has dark colors which is perfect for a movie like this. Great sequences and a phenomenal performance by Keanu Reeves along side stars like William dafoe and ian mcshane. Absolutely a great movie and teaches a lesson - don't mess with baba yega.,8,0,3,7 April 2020
Star Trek," It was fine 6/10
","A new start for the 'star trek' franchise means either good movies or bad movies, in the case of this trilogy (maybe a fourth film?). The franchise's future seems fine: An ensemble cast of great actors and an apprentice of the original spock (Leonard Nimoy), good visual effects and makeup design. Overall it is a fun movie to watch.",6,0,0,20 May 2020
The Maze Runner," Great film! 7/10
","The maze runner is a great movie, I knew then it was a success but when I watched it the first time I couldn't wait for the sequel to come. The whole setting was done well and the story itself was amazing. I know this is part of Hollywood's plan of making teenage films based on novels for teens: divergent, hunger games and more. Usually those movies aren't really special but in this case I can be positive. Dylan O'Brien And Thomas Brodie Sangster are fantastic.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
Memento," So, where was I? 8/10
","I think the main advantage of the film is the narrative that is completely backwards, all the scenes in black and white are perfect for the voice over of the main character and it really shows the feature of time in the movie. If the narrative would have been normal from start to finish it would have been boring. One thing that I kind of felt missing was the ending, I just think we needed to have a clear view on what happened in the first scene of the movie to get some kind of closure.",8,0,0,10 April 2020
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Now this is a original story! 8/10
","At first I wondered if it was a good idea to make a spin off based on star wars, I wasn't really positive about the film, but as time passed and I decided to give it a chance, I found out this was an amazing movie. I went to see it in theaters and couldn't believe how amazing it was! The characters were awesome and really cool, the story was so original, more original than I imagined, great script, and the whole plot just fits perfectly into the original trilogy. Felicity Jones was perfect, Diego Luna did a great job with his character, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, Forrest Whitaker, Ben Mendelsohn and Mads Mikkelsen are fantastic characters. I enjoyed it so much, this one of star wars best films ever and why? Because it is not dependent on the original story. It may be a spin off but it is great as it is.",8,1,1,15 May 2020
Star Trek Into Darkness," A bit off the record 6/10
","The sequel to 'Star Trek' (2009) is a bit off. The characters are not interesting, Benedict Cumberbatch is good but his character is very controversial and complicated. There isn't any threat, just a few skirmishes. No bigy. and there isn't any huge sacrifice at the end, something to end this film and give a higher interest for the next film.",6,0,2,20 May 2020
Public Enemies," Good gangster movie 7/10
","Johnny Depp and Christian bale are awesome in their roles, Michael mann has done a great job with the picture. He did it before back then with 'heat' and he does it again this time. Although for a gangster movie I wouldn't say it's on the same level as the other classic gangster movies. It's a good one for sure.",7,1,2,4 April 2020
The Irishman," I heard this movie paints houses 9/10
","Scorsese had a rough time lately with the whole 'marvel' scenario in which his right. But mostly he had a rough time because Netflix were the only ones to work with him on the production of the movie, which is a big flop for the rest of Hollywood that is focused on making franchise films. Anyway 'The Irishman' is a fantastic movie well written by Steven Zaillian, with great dialogue, Hollywood's best actors in the world, fabulous story that hasn't been told in this scale yet and much more. The story of Frank Sheeran, the man who worked closely with Jimmy Hoffa and the Italian mafia, his story is told by his point of view and we the audience are aware of everything he's been part of since the 50's. Robert DeNiro does an amazing job and performance, Al Pacino is great with his iconic scenes of yelling and making a big scene out of everything. Joe Pesci is a revolutionary and he plays exactly like in his earlier roles in Goodfellas, Casino and Raging Bull. The movie has other cast members who are great and fun to watch them act. Even though the movie is three and a half hours it is worth every minute of viewing, I think it's possible to stop at the middle if you need a break but overall the length doesn't matter, it's just an interesting story to learn much from. In every Scorsese movie you get to learn something new and interesting, a huge plot and a special motive. that's way his movies are amazing at first look. His movies are obviously 'lessons of cinema' that evey film buff should Know and see. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and the set decoration fits the setting well. Something that might be missing is a little more violence. Although the movie has a great story, all of Scorsese's movies have the feature of 'the rise and fall of the protagonist', because the story is a little more different than the typical gangster movie, so there is no feature and not much of violence, but maybe it doesn't need anyway? I don't know... 'The Irishman' is a fabulous movie that deserved more appreciation and academy awards for it's success. I loved it and definitely recommend, unless you want to get wacked by Joe Pesci.",9,0,1,4 June 2020
The Fifth Element," Luc Besson did it again 7/10
","'The Fifth Element' is a fun, enjoyable and action packed movie. The first half of the movie feels like a really long exposition. Nothing much happens until the cruiser in space is being attacked. Only then you feel the story is moving. Bruce Willis nailes his performance by playing a badass character as he does always. Milla Jovovich is perfect and vital as leeloo. Gary Oldman portrays the villain once again, and does a fantastic work once again. Overall a fun ride.",7,0,0,22 June 2020
Finding Nemo," One of the best ever 9/10
",I love 'finding nemo'! It is considered one of the best Pixar pictures ever and definitely a game changer. What i love so much about it is the great dynamic between marlin and dory. The jokes are great. And I've seen this movie too many times to not like it. Besides it is very emotional and Pixar always create emotional movies that can be so fantastic.,9,0,0,5 April 2020
The Mummy," Nice adventure 7/10
","'The Mummy' is a great movie, full of elements and similarities to 'Indiana Jones' and other adventure movies. This is a fun action packed film for the family to watch. It's entertaining, funny and scary. Brendan Fraser is a fun actor, has a bit of attitude such as Indiana Jones. Rachael Weisz is gorgeous and John Hannah plays the role of the comedian in the film. In all films of explores you have the funny wacky character and Hannah does a great job. more than that I find the movie to be pretty simple, not a classic but neither a waste of time. Just a fun adventure movie to watch.",7,1,1,26 June 2020
Troy," This was epic 7/10
","One of the best films ever created based on Greek mythology. The story of Troy vs the forces of Greece and the love story that complicates everything. The cast of actors are from the best I've seen in a movie: Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, Orlando Bloom and Many more that are fantastic. The costume design was perfect and accurate, the score is beautiful, the set decoration was amazing although for a movie like this I imagine the production used CGI and green screen so I hope they also managed to create an accurate look of troy without any computers. Because the story is so familiar with people the movie gives us a perfect narrative of start to finish. If you know the story of Troy so you know how it will end. Too bad tough that Hollywood doesn't make movies like these anymore, but anyway who on the other hand is asking for a remake???",7,0,0,24 May 2020
The Prestige," Very complicated but worth it 7/10
","The movie it self was a tough one to understand. Maybe the first 30 minutes are hard but once you figured out the characters, the plot, the background and so forth. You see nolan is responsible for a really good feature. Both Christian bale are hugh Jackman are fantastic in their portrayals and Michael Caine is even better. I really liked that even if it's not based on a true story then it involved real characters such as nicola Tesla and adison. Great portrayal of David Bowie. The plot is complicated but I enjoyed how the characters outsmarted each other in every occasion. Great job nolan.",7,1,1,10 April 2020
Ready Player One," Spielberg does it again! 9/10
","One of cinema's best directors ever proves once again he is a Picasso in movies. 'Ready Player One' is a fun and amazing experience, every Spielberg fan should watch it. For those who read the novel in which the movie is based on and for those who already saw the movie I won't waste time telling the plot. But bringing this story to the big screen shouldn't have been easy so I really appreciate the work they have done, both the visual effects and the CGI crew. Although I don't like much of green screen and CGI in a action movie cause it doesn't feel real, but for this movie it was necessary and wouldn't have been the same. The actors were fantastic: Ben Mendelsohn, mark rylance, T.J Miller and Simon pegg. Along with young talented actors like Ty Sheridan and Olivia Cooke make a perfect cast. Both of my favorite sequences in the movie were the sequence of 'The Shining' and the final battle near the end. Overall it is a fabulous ride that I definitely recommend. It is an adventure too big for the real world.",9,1,1,5 June 2020
The Bodyguard," good romance movie but that's pretty much it 6\10
","This is a good movie but there is nothing much else to say about the bodyguard. I mean this is a simple story: an ex secret service agent is tasked with protecting an R&B singer from threats on her life, and that's pretty much it with the plot. kevin costner delivers a good performance and I really agree with his decisions in the film and what he does. whitney houston is probebly one of the most annoying characters I have recently seen in cinema history. her character is so annoying I had high hopes she would die in the movie.",6,1,2,2 May 2020
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The perfect ending for the perfect trilogy 8/10
","So I think on a personal note, I prefer this third film over the two others. Simply because it is really good. The movie stars with a time gap between 'The Empire strikes Back' and it's opening. Which is something I prefer in movies: a time gap of a few days or weeks, maybe months to give the audience a feeling of change. It's better then starting the film exactly where it ended last time. That is one thing. The other is the hugh battle in space that has become a tradition in star wars films, to have large scaled battles in space. The final battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader is really remarkable and gives us a little father - son fight. I mean for real now, don't you get emotional from the scene where Luke and vader talk to each other? Overall the ending on the planet endor is the perfect ending for this perfect trilogy.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
The Town," An average heist movie 6/10
","Ben Affleck is a well appreciated director and actor but when it comes to movies about a heist or big robbery, then it's a little difficult to make an impression. The film happens to be an average heist movie with no twists and not a lot of entertainment. Although I did love the performance of the actors: Jon Hamm was good and great. The ending was greatly done and well made. I do love Ben Affleck's movies but maybe I was expecting too much. I do love his other movies though. overall a nice movie that reminds other heist movies so no surprise here.",6,0,0,29 May 2020
Taxi Driver," one of scorsese's best ever 8\10
","What I love most about 'Taxi Driver' is the score of the movie by Bernard Herrmann. you can't avoid not hearing that beatiful score composed by him. of course the colores in the movie were great and it gives you a dark version of new york. the main subject of the film is of course Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro). this character is a complete ticking bomb that waits to explode anytime soon. but when you look closely, maybe you can agree with his point of view and his actions. all he wants to do is wipe out all the crime and drugs of the streets but he takes the law into his own hands. and this is something a lot of people can justify. everyone would have wanted to take the law into his own matters. Travis feels like he needs to save both the women he adores: Betsy is 'in danger' by the world of politics and iris is in danger by all the gangsters around her. eventually he saves only iris from the world of crime, which seems logical but in travis's point of view he needs to do more, that's why in the ending Travis hasn't changed, he is still going to take matters into his own hands and it is question of time when will he 'explode' again. scorsese, you nailed it again.",8,0,1,6 May 2020
Lost in Translation," slow and sleepy but good and colorful 6\10
","The first 10 minutes of the film made me realize from where shawn mendes's song 'Lost in Japan' was inspired by. if you look back, you'll see the same images and scenes from the song in the movie. when I was asked what this movie is about, I seemply ansered that the film is about an actor in his fifties or sixties who doesn't act anymore and a young lady who doesn't know what she wants to do in the future. eventually the two characters find comfort in each other's company. now I realize that the movie is about loneliness and how people can find comfort with people they like. I also love the idea that the film happnes in Japan where the characters can't comunicate easily with the people in tokyo, so the title of the film makes sense cause of the lost of the characters and how they can't understand anyone. also the colores of the film were really good and gave the film a colorful tone. overall i feel like the movie was fine, not my top choise to watch but fine. I think shawn mendes did it better with his song.",6,0,0,25 April 2020
Full Metal Jacket," one of the best movies about vietnam war 8\10
","Stanley Kubrick has done a remarkable job with this film. From showing how young soldiers become maniacs and killing machines on the battle fields and horrors of the war. The film gives a clear point of view of the soldier's perspective of the war, how they feel, what they think about it, what they are doing and if they feel like they are doing the right thing. The most powerful part of the film is the training process in the beginning with R. Lee Ermey and his acting skills. Also Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio are good in that part. the filming was perfect and the camera movements were really realistic to a soldier's P.O.V. the shots of zoom out and zoom in were good and the music during the more creepy scenes really gave a perfect tone of darkness and brutality. overall I can't find a moment that I didn't like during the movie or a bad scene that made the movie less good then it is already.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Fine but doesn't save the trilogy 6/10
","It seems what JJ Abrams wanted to do with the film is make a full conclusion to the story George Lucas created back then with the original films. But seriously now... you can't expect to end a saga of 40 years with only one film. Maybe 'the rise of Skywalker' is good enough to end this particular trilogy, I think it works better to end this trilogy. But not the whole saga because it already has an ending. This trilogy just doesn't fit well with the Skywalker story fans have come to known. If this trilogy was directed by George Lucas himself and the story happened right after 'return of the jedi' it would have made more sense. Maybe if they went for the original script of the film called 'duel of the fates' (see? Already ties well into the other films ;)). The actors did a great job and it is shown how they gained the love of the fans throughout the years but the characters feel a little down, like to much was added to them (rey), or their story arc weren't developed enough (finn). I am also disappointed about kylo ren's story, I feel it couldn't have been better if he stayed a villain and became more of a villain than he was before. I would have preferred to see that then bringing back palpatine to play the bad guy again, with not much explanation on how he is alive. And of course let's not forget the last scene where Rey decides to call herself 'Skywalker'. I mean really? She could have kept her true identity, be proud of herself and not what she could have become (palpatine's successor) and go on a quest to become a better person than her grandfather was. To try and help the galaxy and change the reputation of her family's name. Overall I don't know what I feel about this film, maybe if I watched it again I would know for sure.",6,1,6,15 May 2020
American Sniper," A great war movie 8/10
","The story of chris Kyle, one of u.s military best snipers is a story of how war affects a man's life and mind. The action sequences were great and Bradley cooper is fantastic as chris Kyle. I liked how the movie shows his journey of becoming a marine and his fears and inner conflicts of what to do when he's in sniper possession. From his childhood till the day he was killed helping another veteran. I just wished the scenes where he was with the other veterans were longer so it seems he has been through some sort of 'journey' and now he is taking care of himself, trying to stay alive and well. To see him with the other veterans at the end of the movie helped me understand his suffer during the war. And I wished we would have seen more of it.",8,26,36,14 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Three simple words: the clone army 7/10
","This is my favorite star wars film out of the sequel trilogy AND out of the whole saga! Simply because of the clone army, I grew up on the clone troopers since ever and I did wish they had more screen time in the film, to see them more often. The writing was a little off, more scenes were really stupid and became a joke/memes. The acting was exaggerated for example Hayden christensen and others. All in all it was fine, good enough.",7,1,1,14 May 2020
Forrest Gump," The best of Robert Zemeckis 8/10
","I grew up watching this movie a thousand times and enjoyed it everytime. The story of life and death, challenges and fears, and if life decides your fate of you decide on your own. Everything in this story is emotional and well made. The plot is told from the point of view of Forrest Gump. A man with low IQ who is really special in his perspective on life. Tom Hanks has done a remarkable job on the role and is considered one of his best. The directing by Robert Zemeckis is perfect, the amount of writing and effort put into this film is well appreciated. Even if 'Back to the future' is well known by Zemeckis I think this film is better, simply because of the story. The movie is fulled with touching and great moments, like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
Top Secret!," Silly but it's a comedy so who cares? 7/10
","Abrahams and the zuckers have done a great job and brought us this stupid but surprisingly funny movie, I quite forgot how funny it was. An oldie but godie. You really have to notice the small details to enjoy this comedy and it's all worth it.",7,0,1,4 April 2020
Fargo," Dark and humorous at the same time 8\10
","It's been a while since i've seen 'Fargo' but I really loved the art direction and the whole setting of the film, where it takes place and who are the weird characters you immediately suspect something's wrong with them, great performance by Steve Buscemi and Frances McDormand. I was surprised to know that the movie was based on true events because the writing seems really original. i did love the humorous moments like the continuous use of the word 'yah' in the film. I'm sure the series will be good once i'll start watching but at the meantime I recomend to watch this film if you are a Coen brothers fan.",8,0,0,11 May 2020
The Aviator," Great aviator movie 8/10
","Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio team up to create a movie based on Howard Hughes. I really loved the plot that focused on the character of Howard, how the movie shows his glory days and turning events throughout history. Leonardo DiCaprio does a remarkable job, Martin Scorsese made a rare movie. Not the type of violent gangster movies we the audience are normal with in his work. At the same time it is a pleasant surprise to see him work on a movie like this. Rare to his kind of movies but amazing at the same time. I loved the cinematography of the film that captured all plane sequences.
On the other hand, I feel some scenes were dramatized such as the crash landing scene where Howard gets badly injured. I would have changed it a bit. I would also clearfy the fact about Howard Hughes's obsession with everything clean. I felt the film had no explanation to his kind of 'problem' thus making it look weird on screen. All in all I recommend because it has a nice character arc of a historical figure who was a weirdo. One of the best movies about aviators and planes.",8,0,0,20 June 2020
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Good........ Morning Vietnam! 7/10
","Whether it's a biography or just a comedy, this film was really really good. The director knew when to make people laugh and when to make the movie more serious. Of course the most catchy phrase of the film is Robin Williams line (the film's title). By the way the performance of Robin is absolutely amazing, you can tell this is a perfect role for him and Forest Whitaker was great and smart. Maybe it's a bit hard to understand those jokes or maybe the character just spoke to fast that you can barely understand what he's saying but I really enjoyed it.",7,0,0,13 May 2020
Baby Driver," The best movie ever of 2017. 9/10
","There is no movie more amazing, more intense, more original and more awesome than Edgar Wright's baby driver (2017). I know I might be exaggerating but for real, this is one of the best movies I've seen in the last few years. It has a great and original script idea. The whole tone of the movie is intriguing, fun and fast. If you thought 'The Fast and The Furious' franchise has no content, you won't be disappointed with this killer heist movie. Ansel Elgort delivers his best performance in a movie. His acting and coolness on screen is amazing. I'm attached to his character. Lily James is stunning in her performance. Kevin Spacey is fantastic as a mob guy who runs the whole operation. Jamie Foxx is annoying but that's the whole point with his character and that's why I loved him. Jon Bernthal, Jon Hamm and Eisa Gonzales are fabulous and great actors. Hands down to Edgar Wright on the writing and directing of the movie. He made the best out of it. I think for the whole movie I had absolutely no problem. Nothing bad to say about it, I enjoyed most sequences although I can point on a few things that bothered me:
1) when baby was interrogated by Doc and the rest of the team, after they went to his house and stole all his records. Baby is facing a big challenge. The crew members of the heist are accusing him of betrayal and calling him a 'snitch', throughout the movie baby's character is silent and cool but I was hoping for him to get more mad. Instead of playing one of his records to show he is just making music, why can't he defend himself a little more?. His adoptive father was probably hit, his girlfriend is in danger, why I don't see his character changing a bit and turning from cool mode to bad mode?. I really hoped in this particular scene where he is in danger and being questioned. That we will see him all hothead.
That's it, that's how I enjoyed the movie, and it is rare cause I have nothing else bad to say about it.
The soundtrack is probably the main feature here, every song is a masterpiece and fits so well into every scene or sequence. Every scene has a song that matches perfectly for the tone and genre of the movie. One of the best soundtracks ever made for a movie. My favorite moment of the film has to be opening sequence of baby walking to get coffee for the others. This scene is just so well made, the one shot filming of the scene that focuses on baby, the song 'Harlem Shuffle' by Bob and Earl in the background is fantastic, and all the words of the song on the background was a nice touch: when baby slides, the words 'right here' appear on the floor (genius). I wish I can talk more about this movie but maybe it's better to highly recommend this film, a nice, furious and thriller packed heist movie. With an original idea. This movie should have won:
Best picture, Best original screenplay, Best leading actor for Ansel Elgort, Best supporting actor for Jamie Foxx and of course Best soundtrack. That's not an oscar category but it delivers my point.",9,0,2,8 June 2020
Cast Away," Cast Away is an emotional story 8/10
","The whole point of the film is man surviving Nature, which is a famous case in a lot of survival movies. Only in this particular film. It is man surviving an island with a volleyball. The whole movie focuses on one character, Chuck Nolan. Tom Hanks is doing a terrific job. Chuck is faced with the dangers of the island and the fact that he is all alone with no one to talk to. This is also the kind of movie that I love. The kind of movies where the hero needs to face a danger bigger than war or explosions... in one word - Nature. And that is what I want to see.",8,1,1,14 May 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Too damn perfect 8/10
","I can assure you all this movie is perfect. The animation is amazing and probably the main advantage of the film but great casting as well. Fantastic performance by Shameik Moore and the rest. Really loved the story they brought with the whole multiverse thing and how every spiderman in the movie represents a different dimension. For example the spiderman noir represents the movies of the 30s and how spider ham comes from a looney toons kind of dimension. Overall I loved it, really did.",8,0,0,11 April 2020
Salt," good action, too many twists 6\10
","Well I guess the movie itself was fine, it had good action and good moments but i feel like the whole polt was completly messed up and had way to many twists. I think the moment where the movie started being boring was when the audience discover that salt was the russian spy after all but then we get more plot details and the moment came too early during the film. I'm sitting on the sofa, watching the film, then the moment comes when we discover that salt is the russian spy the americans were looking for but it happens too early as I said and well, then I'm left wondering what is left to tell so I think that was a big flaw with the script, and again after that moment we get more confusing plot twists and from here you can allow yourself to fall a sleep.",6,1,2,25 April 2020
Apocalypse Now," Outstanding and psychological at the same time 8\10
","So obviously this is not a simple vietnam war movie, unlike 'Born On The Forth Of July' that tells an emotional story and a story of humanity. 'Apocalypse Now' is a story of how a man becomes a psycho and a madman. there is chaos everywhere and it really seems like it's the end of the world, I know that when I saw the film there were moments I couldn't believe actually happend in real life and you really get this sort of feeling that it's the end, just like the song of 'The Doors'. the actors were absolutely fantastic: Martin Sheen is great and delivers a good performance. his character is a perfect example to what a anti - hero is. I mean he does have a lot of features that show he isn't a hero like rambo or he is not a soldier that will save innocent people. Martin Sheen's character is the type of tragic and anti hero who cares of nothing. Robert Duvall is perfect in his role with his famous catchy line 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning'. Marlon brando should have recieved an academy award for his portrayal as colonel kurtz, or at least a nomination, I just wished we got to see more of colonel kurtz early in the movie maybe flashbacks of him. the whole editing part was fantastic, I loved the technique of 'disolve' during the film and the whole art direction how every detail is well made. the main idea of the film is important as everything else, clearly this is a movie of how a man becomes insane and how the nature makes a man go wild, it's like a string that pulls you into the jungle till you become a madman. and that is what coppola does best with the film, outstanding!",8,0,1,3 May 2020
Jarhead," Fantastic overlook on a soldier's perspective 7/10
","Jarhead is not a simple and avenge war movie, it is a movie that shows the audience the perspective of a soldier during war. How he reacts to things, how he behaves, how slowly he becomes mad and loses himself. In many ways it reminded me of 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'Apocalypse Now'. The movie is based on a book of a former US marine so the audience get a small look at the reality that was going on in the gulf war. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic and plays a soldier who's whole point of view over the war is portrayed fabulously. Jamie Foxx never disappoints in any role and shows a great performance. The cinematography of the film in the second half is fabulous, so many great shots and dark colors to capture the fear of the viewers. The scenes where the soldiers were on tours and overlooking the surface were shot beautifully, moments of tension and struggle. Overall it is a fantastic movie that gives us the perspective of a soldier.",7,0,0,3 July 2020
American History X," delivers a very important message 7\10
","American history x is truly one heck of a film. it shows the viewers the perspective and point of view of the racist side and how they think and feel. you can't avoid during the movie to not listen to what the characters have to say and how uneducated they are. in the film you realize how the movie shows that the u.s is devided into groups of people from all sorts of countries and colores, you may think that united states is a country of equal and everybody is part of a family but in this case with the film you see how everybody hates each other. even at the end of the movie when the student shoots danny at the end so you see how much of hatred there is and you get some sort clue that the movie is about not accepting people and 'everyone belongs to his own group'. of course you can't accept the neo nazi's opinion in the movie and realize how insane they are but you kind of get to understand their motives and how they think about certain stuff. edward norton is truly great in his portrayal and how his character is smarter then the others ans his brother. after watching a movie like this you are going to have deep thoughts about the society and how things may really seem in the country.",7,0,0,18 April 2020
Yesterday," Fabulous experience 7/10
","I really enjoyed 'yesterday'. It is a highly recommended movie for all fans of 'The Beatles' and viewers in general. The concept idea for this kind of movie is brilliant and original that I was hyped from the first trailer. Even thinking about it is crazy, a world without 'the Beatles' is not realistic and quite scary. That's why I sympathize with the main character jack malick. I feel his character was well written and the transformation he goes through is well portrayed by Himesh Patel. Lily James is gorgeous and Ed Sheeran has a good role as himself. My only two problems with the movie are minor: for once I would have wanted to know what happened to the Beatles if they didn't became famous, not only John Lennon but Paul, George and Ringo as well. The second thing is that it was great hearing all those songs again. But why do all the songs need to be portrayed by one person? Maybe it was done on purpose to show Jack as the only person who knows the songs. But I would have wanted to listen to the original versions as well. Anyway I really loved it and I suggest all fans to watch 'yesterday'.",7,0,0,20 June 2020
Legends of the Fall," An epic emotional story 8/10
","'Legends of the fall' Is an emotional story of brotherhood, friendship and love. A family struggles to stay together as war and tragic events occur to them. This movie reminded me in many ways of 'Little Women', another movie based on a novel by Agatha Christie. This movie is based on a story by Jim Harrison. It's stars Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are amazing in their portrayals and deliver real emotions. The rest of the cast are good as well. Doing a great work with their characters. I loved the cinematography and soundtrack that was composed for the movie, it fitted nicely in to the movie's tone. What really makes the movie extraordinary is it's story and how it doesn't give the characters much of a happy ending. Including Brad Pitt's character, he tried to protect everyone he loved but they all die in tragic ways. If the movie would have ended on a happy note it would have been a waste. Ending the story like that on a sad note is just the ending it needed.",8,0,0,7 June 2020
The Pianist," A historical classic 8/10
",Roman Polanski's historical movie 'the pianist' is a movie of struggle in dark times and survival. A movie that has to be passed on the next generations so they can learn from it. The sort of journey that adrian broody's character is going through is the story of survival of many others in the holocaust. And one that should be remembered for decades to come. Fantastic work by Roman Polanski.,8,0,0,14 April 2020
Django Unchained," funny and extraordinary 8\10
","Who loves tarantino? if you do, then you should definitely watch Django Unchained. it is great, it's funny, it's action packed and full of great scenes and has a fantastic cast. Christoph waltz nailes his role and does it again. Jamie Fox is cool, does a wonderful acting job and of course Leonardo Dicaprio is famous in this film for the scene where he cuts his hand of in reality. the whole plot is dark because it talks about slavery and racism but in a weird and creative way. the plot is funny as well, even samuel l. jackson does a remarkable job ans makes the vibe of the film go a little funny. the soundtrack is awsome and all the scenes of flashback with Django are really powerfull, they give much to his character and his past so that during the movie he can change and take a stand against his enemies.",8,0,2,6 May 2020
The Theory of Everything," The Theory of a love story 8/10
","I believe this is the best romance movie that is based on a true story. James Marsh the director did a marvelous job, the score composed by Johann Johannsson is remarkably beautiful. Eddie Redmayne gives the performance of his life as Stephen Hawking. Felicity Jones is incredibly talented as Jane Wlide. The movie's tone is beautiful and well made, I got attached within the first 20 minutes of the film. There are many other movies based on a true story that have a romance between two characters, in which one of the characters suffers from a disease: 'Breath', 'I Still Believe', 'The Fault in Our Stars' etc. But 'The Theory Of Everything' tops everyone because of the chemistry between the characters and how their emotions drive the movie and make it shine.",8,0,0,6 July 2020
I Am Legend," A great post apocalyptic movie 7/10
",I think movie thriller starring will Smith is one of those movies that is the closest to reality. If ever humanity is in such a situation like in the movie so it gives good tips for survival. Besides it shows how a man can go crazy for being alone in the world and lose everything. Great performance by Smith.,7,2,2,7 April 2020
Gran Torino," The tragic story of walt kowalski 8/10
","Clint Eastwood has done a marvelous job with this film and here's why: a story of a old man, a veteran of a war who lost everything and has a family that waits for him to die. Finds comfort with the same people he used to fight back in the war. This is also the kind of story you see in other movies but here it is done the best, especially with Clint Eastwood as the main actor who deserves an academy award for acting and directing. It is a sad story dough with kowalski being an example of a man who lives with no family support or love and how he loses faith so easily.",8,1,1,14 April 2020
Back to the Future Part III," repeating itself once again 6/10
","Honestly, I would have prefered if robert zemeckis made only one film of 'back to the future'. the second film was solid but this one was really not necessary and kind of silly. the reference to clint eastwood and the train sequence were good enough for me the watch the film but if it was up to me then i would have just made one film. i guess all we need to do now is wait for another movie and maybe a spin off?. just to see this franchise getting ruined even more. but due to the ending of part three I can reas and assure this is the end of back to the future.",6,0,2,15 April 2020
Men in Black II," Less good than the first one 5/10
","So this is a rule in all movie franchises: the more sequels, the more the threat/enemy is bigger. In the case of MIB 2 the threat is a joke and doesn't seem to matter much. Even the duo of agents didn't save this movie from failing. I guess the concept of an agency that protects earth from aliens is starting to be pretty ridiculous and simple by now.",5,0,0,15 May 2020
1917," Should have won best picture 9/10
","With all due respect to parasite, Sam Mendes's masterpiece is an incredible movie. A journey of two soldiers to the enemy lines in order to call of the attack on the enemy turns to be a bloody scenario of survival and time running out. A pure fantastic movie in one shots deserve much more appreciation then any other movie this year at the academy awards.",9,2,5,28 March 2020
Donnie Brasco," Very good but slow 7/10
",My first thought of the movie was that it was kind of slow for a gangster movie. I wasn't anticipating something to blow my mind but I had high hopes for the film. It felt like the whole plot was going very slowly and you really had to focus just to get some kind of sense. The actors were really great in their portrayals of the characters. Interesting choice for al Pacino to play that character. I regular to watch him in films as the main 'wiseguy' and the mastermind behind everything but here he is just a 'soldier' and kind of clueless. Johnny Depp is great in his portrayal of donnie.,7,0,0,10 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," I mean... from where to begin? 3/10
","This must be the worst star wars film ever. Let's take a closer look over this cinematic failure:
Luke Skywalker's character being completely ruined.
Finn's story arc being pushed aside or not well made, which is disappointing because finn is a really good character.
Too many turn points in the film.
Characters like rose tico and admiral holdo who weren't fun at all.
The whole throne room scene before the fight happened, snoke and rey and kylo talking and stupid stuff happening. Really bad scene.
The whole part of rey and kylo ren, first being allies then enemies, then they're fighting each other. Really complicated.
If I would have split the movie into parts I would have done it this way:
First half was terrible.
Second half a bit better.
The end - stupid.",3,9,12,14 May 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A bloody massacre and it's bloody fantastic 8\10
","So this film is one of tarantino's masterpieces, that is well known but think about it. all tarantino's movies were bloody and violent but it was sort of a comedy (for exsample: pulp fiction, it's violent and at the same time funny. you can't help yourself to not laugh). in this case of 'kill bill' you feel kind of disturbed and uncomfortable with the scenes. even tarantino said it was his first experience with this much of violence but with the storytelling and plot so it doesn't matter. all the references to the japanise culture and samurai fighting are great and fabulous. uma thurman is fantastic as the bride and lucy liu is great. of course one of the all time remarkable scenes of the movie is the sequesne of the bride against the crazy 88. outstanding!!!",8,1,1,17 April 2020
Hotel Mumbai," Good intense film 7/10
","'Hotel Mumbai' is a good intense movie based on actual events. I admit I was watching the film just out of ease but the movie's tone caught me up. Great intense moments and nice scenes. Dev Patel was brilliant but it felt like his character was pushed uside and didn't do much. There were a lot of other scenes that to me felt unnecessary, for example: the scene where a group of policemen enter the hotel in order to save people ended up killing more people and lead to nowhere with no results. So overall it is an intense movie with great moments, a story of terrified people who try to escape the horrors of terror in order to survive. And the story of the staff at the Taj hotel who try to defend their guests.",7,1,4,17 June 2020
Men in Black," Classic blockbuster 7/10
","Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are the lead actors in this crazy, weird and funny as hell movie fulled with aliens.

Fun and awesome, definitely recommend.",7,1,1,15 May 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," That was beatiful and very complex 8\10
","At first I thought I was going to see something familiar to 'Lost In Translation'. but that thought immediately changed. the story's plot is very confusing and explaining it would just ruin a bit of it's uniqueness. so I want to focus on the characters. both of Jim Carry and Kate Winslet's characters are unique and lonely. my first impression on these characters are how familiar they are to the ones in 'lost in translation'. they both need their own space and they act really differently than other people, that's what I find so great in them. Jim Carry is just amazing in this role, I never really got attached to his roles in comedy movies but to see him in this film was a big change.",8,0,0,9 May 2020
Reservoir Dogs," the start of a spectacular director and the beginning of a wonderful story 8\10
","So, 'Reservoir Dogs'. what is there to say? when I first saw this film I didn't know what I was expecting, of course what came afterwards was just phenomenal: great writing, funny dialogue, gruesome scenes and much more. the tipical Quentin Tarantino film. in the good way of saying it that way. now the movie plot that goes back and forth with the narrative is one of tarantino's main ideas in his movies and seeing it for the first time is just absolutly great. all the characters in this movie are well portrayed by there actors: Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen. and here is something else, this is tatantino's big start in hollywood and his debut as a well known director in years to come. so you can see this film in a surtain point of view that this tells the beginning of tarantino's story and legacy.",8,0,1,4 May 2020
Sicario," Really good, brutal and phenomenal 7/10
","Emily Blunt is great, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro are fantastic. The whole story is really creative and original. The characters are great and how they act is real. You can maybe agree with there actions or you can disagree, have common thoughts. It doesn't seem like there is a main bad guy in the film. It's just the 'good guys' with mixed thoughts on what they are doing.",7,0,0,16 May 2020
Pretty Woman," Beautiful love story 7/10
","'Pretty Woman' is a love letter to all people out there who seek their 'fairy tale'. Just like Vivian (Roberts), everyone has his/her love story that reminds of Cinderella. And so this movie is a love letter to all those people out there. It is a great, funny and fabulous movie staring Richard Gere who is good as always and Julia Roberts who is stunning and gorgeous. You also get to see Costanza in the film - I mean Jason Alexander! Sorry, reflex. The movie has a great soundtrack that fits its tone of a romance movie in which I appreciate. Finally I think this is a great classic movie that all people with love tales should watch and have fun with, not only it was a hit back in the day but even today it's strong message can affect the viewers. If you have a love fantasy/tale then this is the perfect movie to watch.",7,0,0,6 July 2020
Pulp Fiction," I dare you, I double dare you if you don't love this movie! 8/10
","First thing's first, this is tarantino's most original and famous script ever written. the diffrenet storylines of the characters in the movie are so great you would watch them again and enjoy them just like the first time. all diffrenet story arcs clash togeter in unexpected ways. one of the main advantages of the film is the narrative that goes all upsite down, the narrative doesn't go from start to finish and it's better that way, it's a way of tarantino to tell his story in all sort of ways and directions. the characters were well written and my favorite character has to be jules, he had most of the unforgetable lines and was a key member in the movie. the soundtrack was terrific and definitely great for the tone and genre of the movie. the actors were fantastic with samuel l. jackson and john travolta at there best in thus masterpiece. so if the movie is so perfect why give it a 8? maybe it's not perfect in all categories and maybe some people consider it only to be one of tarantino's greatest but not THE greatest. I for once disagree cuase it is perfect and surtely the best of all.",8,2,2,15 April 2020
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," really good, took a while to get interesting 7\10
","Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good film by Guy Ritchie. it took me personally a while to understand the plot until it got interesting, I believe one of the flaws is with all the minor characters who don't do much and don't serve the film. I feel kind of a relief that most of them died cause what would have been the point to keep everyone alive. with all that being said the actors were great and did a fine job (i love jason statham and dexter fletcher) and there is a nice little twist at the that makes the movie end perfectly. I think the editing and the colors in the film were the main thing that attracted me more then anything else. plus the camera movements as well. i'm starting to like this kind of genre Guy Ritchie gives the audience in his films.",7,0,0,11 May 2020
Mystic River," Not Eastwood's finest but has it's advantages 7/10
","'Mystic River' is a complex movie, about grief, loss, troubled life and childhood tragedy. Although after watching the movie I found it odd to be one of Clint Eastwood's best films. To me it's not his finest. With that being said, he did manage to make an emotional and dramatic story. Sean Penn is wonderful and delivers a great performance. Kevin Bacon and Lawrence Fishburne have a great dynamic during the movie and are great actors. I felt really sorry for Tim Robbins's character. Seeing him suffer like that throughout the whole film made me feel bad for him towards the ending. There is a fabulous cinematography, with shadows over the characters and dark light during the tense moments. I loved the movie's dark tone but I feel in the same time that it is depressing. You can maybe watch the movie once and even once will be enough sad for you. I don't recommend this film but rather suggest his other movies.",7,0,0,13 June 2020
The Departed," Now this is a whole new level 8\10
","Scorsese is a genius and a mastermind of cinema, period. 'the departed' is a movie that makes you think is a game of cat and mouse. a cop (Leonardo DiCaprio) and a gangster (Matt Damon) are each chasing one another when infact both of them are 'rats' in their on organizations. dicaprio is a 'rat' in an irish gang trying to arrest them and damon is a 'rat' in the police enforcement and each one tries to discover the other, a script like this has never been written, I doubt it if it ever happened before. and it is so well written and perfect that when you see the film first time you are amazed. the actors are fantastic: dicaprio, damon, jack nicholson, martin sheen, alec baldwin... but the only one who stole the show and his acting was the best was mark wahlberg and his punch lines. he absolutely deserved the academy award for best supporting actor. although i'm not quite sure if this is considered one of scorsese's finest films. it is great and spectacular but i don't think it's in the same level as 'goodfellas', 'taxi driver' or 'raging bull'. From what I see the movie has it's own level. it's good as it is and perfectly made. great storytelling and wonderful cinematography. 'the departed' is defently a rare and unique kind of film and I doubt if we ever see scorsese making something close to it. I can only imagine.",8,0,0,22 April 2020
It Chapter Two," Not as good as the first one but does the job 6/10
","On one hand I'm happy they didn't make a trilogy out of this story. On the other hand I'm not sure if a sequel was needed. I liked the first movie as it was but based on how the first 'It' ended, with pennywise not being defeated entirely. I understand why they made a sequel to end the story completely. I enjoyed the first movie because it was fun to see kids fighting a monster and facing their fears. Now 27 years later it feels like every other horror movie with adults in it. So I'm not surprised of how it ended. Thus I don't like it. I think the flashbacks towards the past were among the funnier and scarier. I preferred seeing the characters as kids like they were in the first movie. Also the way the characters eventually defeat Pennywise is kind of dumb and lazy. I could see where the writers were lazy with the script and it's near the end. Calling Pennywise a 'clown' and mocking him was really a lame idea. I don't know what else I would have done but the ending to me felt like one of Bill's disappointing book endings. At least there's a cameo of Steven King.",6,0,1,21 June 2020
Jaws," A master of suspense 8/10
","Steven Spielberg's 'Jaws' is a great masterpiece. Lately the only movie that really made me scared and scream was this big hit from the 70's. The whole plot is terrifying and exciting. You never know what might happen to the characters and if they will ever stay alive. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are amazing actors and they play so well. I didn't feel bored for a moment, I was watching with fear and this is what this movie does the best. It captivates the viewers emotions with suspense and thrill. Overall a fabulous movie that will make everyone scream and decide not to go to the sea ever again.",8,0,1,13 June 2020

The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A phenomenal movie 8/10
","'The Battle of The Five Armies' is the final chapter of 'the Hobbit' trilogy, though people will prefer the LOTR trilogy, I enjoyed both of them and think they give a rich story to the world Tolkien has wrote. This movie was a blast, so many great intense moments and remarkable dialogue and chemistry between the characters. The main event of the movie was of course the battle of the five armies. One spectacular sequence that continues till the very end of the movie. One thing that bothered me with the beginning of the film was the quick death of Smaug the dragon. I think it would have been smarter to Keep him for the battle. So I feel the writers wasted some potential with this character. Martin Freeman gives a good performance, ian Mckellen is great as always, Richard Armitage does a great job as Thorin. The rest of the casting is fantastic and we got a nice closure to the trilogy that summons up to the timeline of the LOTR. Which is amazing cause we get a nice clear ending to the whole story. Both trilogys. A fabulous movie that is most recommended and delivers a tearful experience.",8,0,0,19 June 2020

What broke me the most was to see my favorite characters turn on the jedi during order 66. The movie has a lot of moments with exaggerated acting and iconic scenes that became ridiculous over the years. The actors did a wonderful job even with all the difficulties, they still act really well. Even with it's dificulties the movie is fine and has its good moments. And we get a good connection between the two trilogies, from the sequels to the originals.",8,2,2,14 May 2020

That happens in the past before the event of the first movie, in which this movie happens in university is great and amusing. I had a blast watching this movie and it was so much fun just like the first film. Mike Wazowski (Crystal) and Jimi Sullivan (Goodman) and fantastic characters as always and give a lot of emotion towards the film. Seeing them in their College years was funny because you see how different they are from the first movie. The other characters a.k.a Oozma Kappa are funny as hell and creative monsters.

Though I haven't noticed the amount of plot holes in the film that make you wonder what just happened or why there is such a big plot hole and it doesn't seem to matter. But anyway it's a cartoon so I suppose it's legit to break the rules this time right? The movie had good actors although most of them are real basketball players so it's good to see them in action.

The actors are fantastic: Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Issac and Adam Driver have become the new stars of the trilogy.

Munich," A great historical movie that lacks details 8/10
","'Munich' is a great and fabulous movie by Steven Spielberg. With fantastic cinematography such as long shots and camera movements, a perfect cast of actors and a good script. though while I was watching the film I checked how accurate was the movie to the real events of 'black September' and the massacre of the Israeli athletes in the Olympics of 1972. I found out that the movie had a lot of bad critics for not being accurate to history and I agree: The real operation of the 'Mossad' called 'wrath of god' was a highly skilled operation in order to track down the responsibles for the massacre and avenge the death of the athletes. In the movie, the team of assassins act like amateurs which is kind of disappointing cause the story becomes unrealistic. I expected from Spielberg to make better work out of the film. With that being said, I did enjoy the whole plot and how the main character, Avner (Eric Bana) loses faith in his mission and government. The other actors were fantastic as well. I loved the idea of making a movie based on this tragic event but at the same time I think it could have been done better.",8,0,0,9 June 2020
Godzilla," Very well done 7/10
",I guess the main subject here is Godzilla. The characters were good but sometimes you want to focus on the main matter which is Godzilla - the title of the movie. I would have liked to see more of him and follow his arc rather than focus on the minor characters. The CGI was well done for the movie no doubt about it.,7,0,0,9 April 2020
Life," Totally worth it 7/10
","'Life' is an unexpected and surprising movie, it's script is genius. At first I wasn't impressed: here we have another sci fi movie, with aliens and astronauts in danger. I thought this to be an average aliens horror movie. But I was impressed, not only the story is frightening and scary but you have a big twist near the end that makes your jaw drop to the floor - now's that great writing!. Jake Gyllenhaal, Rebecca Ferguson and Ryan Reynolds are fantastic actors that do a great job with their characters. A really intriguing, complex and scary movie. The parasite in the movie 'Calvin' has turned out to be a realistic creature that can exists and that's how much the movie is good. It is realistic.",7,0,0,22 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The first installment in the world's greatest saga
","A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away: the most greatest saga in the history of cinema ever made started. Back in 1977, George Lucas came up with this amazing idea of a new franchise. Some may say he was among the first to bring the post modernization to the big screen. I remember watching this film for the first time when I was five and it was epic. The characters were amazing, the visual effects were great, and the whole plot which is so original is god damn perfect. George Lucas brought so many genres into this film that it's amazing how it doesn't mess things up and keeps the story simple, intimidating and interesting. It's like combining so many colors until you come up with a new color. And of course in this film we are introduced to the most famous and terrifying villain of all time - Darth Vader! And we are introduced to two of the more famous droids in star wars ever - C - 3PO and R2D2. This movie definitely marks the beginning of star wars, which later becomes the most famous saga in cinema history.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
Apollo 13," Houston we have a problem 8/10
","One of the best movies happening in space, it is really a remarkable movie. Tom Hanks, bill paxson, Ed Harris and Kevin Bacon are such wonderful actors and they play so well their roles. Huge shoutout to the art direction and set decoration, the editing and visual effects which were amazing and really made the movie accurate and feel real. All the small details on what happened during the events of apollo 13 were really good and I think it deserved more academy awards.",8,0,0,13 May 2020
Da 5 Bloods," Well achieved film 8/10
","Spike Lee is known for his political movies, sometimes I like them and sometimes I don't know what to say about them. I believe in every movie if his he has to criticize America and everyone's action. Even at the end of the movie you see the movie focuses on today's events in America which i would have preferred to put aside and focus on the story itself. Not politics. With that being said I loved this film. The script was genius and original. Characters who feel real and audience can identify with them. Chadwick Boseman's character Stormin Norman is probably the best character Spike Lee wrote. Cool, leader, brave and smart. The heart of the squad. Without him the group felt lost and you can see on screen how lost they are without his guidance. Another problem I found with this film was the flashbacks to the Vietnam war: in those flashbacks, the group of veterans are seen fighting along their leader Norman. But Norman is young while the others are still old just like in the main timeline. It's like watching 'The Irishman' but with no de - aging. There are no young stunts playing the characters and no makeup, nor CGI in order to make them look young. I don't know if it's on purpose but it affects the movie really bad. There are a lot of other characters in the movie that don't have much value and so you're not surprised that they are dead. Overall I loved the movie, Paul, Otis, Eddie and Melvin are great and funny characters that fans could identify with easley. A fine cast of actors and good cinematography along with nice editing with footage and videos of the past.",8,5,15,14 June 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Awesome as the first one 8/10
",I think this sequel to 'John wick' is better then the first one. Chapter two has more story and details. The action sequences are great and Keanu Reeves delivers a phenomenal performance one more time. The story felt more rich in details and characters.,8,1,1,7 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The more known from the trilogy 8/10
","It seems like in every trilogy of films, there is always one who shines more than the others. In the original trilogy of 'star wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' is the one who shines most then the others. I personally don't know why, maybe it's because of a particular scene in the film? (No, I am your father). Or maybe because it shows that the heroes not always win and suffer a lot? Or maybe because of the charming look of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams)? Whatever it is, you can't ignore that this film is one of 'Star wars' top films and perfect installments of all time.",8,0,0,14 May 2020
Braveheart," A fantastic history movie 8\10
","Mel Gibson has directed a fantastic historical movie that is well made and part of pop culture till these days. of course gibson is great in the portrayal of william wallace and the rest of the cast are good too. but I was amezed by the cinematography, the clear view on the mountains and everything in the backround. the design of the setting was great and the score made for the film. the story itself was good, a story of people fighting for their freedom is exactly what I like to watch and as long as there is some action then it's even better.",8,0,3,5 May 2020
Born on the Fourth of July," Started as a nice movie and became a drama epic 7/10
",The true story of Ron kovac comes to life with this Vietnam war film by Oliver stone. Tom cruise delivers a great performance and the movie seems to be well accurate to history and to the story itself. I loved how the movie changed it's tone from a nice lovely in to a dramatic scenario.,7,1,3,14 April 2020
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," My favorite off all 8/10
","I enjoyed this film more than the others, this is what I consider the best film in the indiana Jones franchise. Harrison Ford is great, Shawn Connery is really iconic and funny in his role of prof. Jones sir. Probably one of his best roles ever. There were too many good scenes in this film that it will be pointless to count them all. Really enjoyable and always love to watch it.",8,0,0,15 May 2020
Back to the Future," a classic that goes way back in time 8/10
","This is a great comedy and action packed film. I really enjoyed it, I don't quite know from where to start exactly. I really loved the idea of a time machine that is actually a car, in this case a dolorian. but i really loved the culture differences between the 50's and 80's and how everything looks different. the music was great especially the sequence where marty plays 'johnny be good' by chuck barry at the school ball. I think the importance of the movie and how it affected pop culture for years to come is what made this movie so special. to me and others",8,0,0,15 April 2020
