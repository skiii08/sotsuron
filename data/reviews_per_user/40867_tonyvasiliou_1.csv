United 93," Flight 93
","I saw the movie Flight 93 and i can honestly say i have never cried so much during a film. It is understandable that the American government had decided to ban this movie to the American public (well unsure about this present day), but as emotional and tragic the movie is, it allows us all to reflect upon those people who died in dignity for saving many more lives for their country. Instead of producing a film focused on the main images of 9/11 (such as on the towers), the director of this movie has given us a clear and honest picture of those heroes who died on flight 93. I cannot think of any film that i have seen that has such a powerful effect upon you as Flight 93. God bless those who died that day and too all the other people who contributed in Washington and New York to save many more lives. X",10,1,3,14 August 2006
