Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cinema rape
","The most stupid expensive movie in film history. Jar Jar is a shameful creation and spoils the rest of the movie which is pretty bad anyway.For me and a lot of deceived fans, this saga is now dead and we will not even consider watching any more movies in the Star Wars franchise.
Shame on Lucas. See Peter Jackson for special effects that serve the story and not the opposite, as in this laughable if not cryable movie.",1,8,16,14 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Oumpf.
","Thank you Mr. Jackson for a wonderful film that fully respects, entertains and challenges the Tolkien/fantasy fan AND the usual movie-goer.Thank you Cast/Crew (including Jackson), for inventive filmmaking, clever ideas, wonderful interpretation.Thank you, New Line Pictures, for taking such an awesome risk and putting this film in the hands of a brilliant, previously underestimated director.Thank you Mr. Tolkien, for we are remembered once again that wonderful world and characters you created that will continue to entertain and fascinate millions.",10,0,0,18 December 2001
