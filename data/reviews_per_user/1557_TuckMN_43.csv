Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Brilliant piece of film as art...
","There just are not enough superlatives to describe the latest edition in the Star Wars saga.YES, Jar Jar Binks is annoying but he is supposed to be.Hugh Quarshie as Captain Panaka is more than a little wooden and stilted but adequate.The foreshadowing in Anakin Skywalkers' home when he says 'No one can kill a Jedi.' is truly chilling.  Out of the mouths of babes...This IS a special effects movie but how else can you have an army of tens of thousands of android soldiers without special effects -- it was brilliantly done.Of course the pod race is on the-edge-of-your-seat thrilling -- just as it should be.All in all, this is a movie for the history books and I MUST see it again.",10,1,2,10 June 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The action/adventure film that all others should be measured by...
","I just had a chance to see `Raiders of the Lost Ark' in the Cinerama format that serves it so well  It is too bad that the prints were not up to the screening.This is the time to see `Raiders..' on the big screen if you possibly can: the prints are already deteriorating and it will not be long before you will not be able to see it on anything but an edited version on the small screen or on video tape  neither one of which serves full justice to this magnificent film.The un-edited, full-screen version had a few surprises; not just language but a couple of scenes that are routinely cut from broadcast television; and, even with the best home theater system, you will not be able to get the full effect of the magnificent score by John Williams.This is one of those all-too-rare films that are as close to perfect as is possible.The attention to detail is more than just amazing  it is breath taking  As an example  when the Ark of the Covenant is finally exposed it would have been so much easier to just have it be'  but instead it is slowly lifted out of the case that holds it; allowing there to be a certain amount of suspense and a few good special effects to be used  the darn thing glows!  just as the word of god would glow.There is action, suspense, drama, comedy, horrible villains, incredible heroes and so much more.  This is a film for the ages  and should be seen on the BIG screen if at all possible.",9,0,0,20 February 2001
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'Come.' 'Stay.'
","These two words spoken by E.T. and Elliott, respectively, is the heart of this beautiful fable of a young boy and his meeting and eventual love for an extra-terrestrial being.Elliott's (Henry Thomas) love is returned in full by E.T., hence E.T.'s desire for Elliott to come home' with him.This makes for a delightful story with all the suspense, laughter and devotion that any good film could ever have.The interaction between Elliott and his family is so finely fashioned that it is completely believable.  (The torturing of the doll brought back a few memories.) There is a truth to their interactions that adds so much to the believability of the film.Just because a movie relies on children to tell a story doesn't make it a children's film.  While this is a family film' there are some issues around language and the death of E.T. that the parents of some children may find objectionable.  Also, parents that cannot control their children should not bring them to a theater where people are actually trying to quietly enjoy a movie.The new revamped Twentieth Anniversary edition of this film classic adds a few scenes, digitally expands on the facial and body movements of E.T. (which couldn't be done with the puppet in the original filming) and removes the guns in one scene.  I must admit that when I saw this film when it came out in 1982 the thought that the children were, on some level, threatened with guns bothered me.  I am glad to see that they are gone.When this film came out it added the `E.T., phone home.' phrase to the American lexicon.The stirring score was the product of the genius of film music: John Williams.  He is a national treasure.This is a brilliant film with a good story and a great message and is certainly worth revisiting. It is a classic for all time.",10,3,6,9 April 2002
Meet the Parents," Much ado about very little.
","After all the hype and great box office I was really expecting to be wowed by this movie  I was not.There are some funny lines and good acting by a good cast but over all it felt like a much longer movie than its 107 minute runtime  Frankly, I was bored through most of it.Probably because, even though Ben Stiller did a good job of playing Greg (Gaylord) Focker, I just couldn't relate to him  and it is important for you (the audience) to be able to relate to his situation in order to laugh at the predicament(s) he gets himself into.At one point Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) asks Greg if he trusts people and then makes the assertion that you can't trust any one.' So basically, Greg should have taken his cue from what Jack said and simply not trusted anyone or the situations that presented themselves to him.The only real message here is that lying doesn't work and compounding your lies with even more lies will only dig you deeper into a hole.This is a lesson that Greg doesn't learn until the very end of the movie  and even then you aren't sure he has really learned the lesson.Blythe Danner is her usual beautiful self and does a good job of playing the too-good-to-be-true' wife of the neurotic Jack.Owen Wilson, who just did a stellar turn in `Shanghai Noon,' is pretty much unbelievable as the goody-two-shoes that was Pam Byrnes' (Teri Polo) former fiancé. No one is that white-bread.Teri Polo is not an actress I am familiar with  but I want to see more of her.  She was very appealing as the daughter of a wildly dysfunctional family.This is a movie that you should wait to see at home on video so you can fast forward through the slow parts  you won't miss a thing.",6,0,0,7 November 2000
As Good as It Gets," Film making at its best.
","I have never been a fan of Jack Nicholson -- but this movie made me re-think his abilities as an actor.Of course, he does what he does best -- play a psycho (The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) but this is a different kind of psycho -- one with a very human side.Mr. Nicholson plays someone with OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) as if he were a victim of this illness for his entire life.From the moment early in the film when he walked into his apartment and counted the number of times he turned the lock on his front door (5) to the number of times he turned the lights on and off in his bathroom (also 5) I knew what his illness was.Helen Hunt as Carol Connelly has just enough edge to her character that you realize she is not perfect either.  In her own way she has OCD also -- regarding her son and HIS illness.There are lots of cameos by well known actors in very small roles: Shirley Knight, Brian Doyle-Murray, Lawrence Kasdan, Harold Ramis, Danielle Brisebois and the ALWAYS entertaining but ever under-utilized Yeardley Smith (I KNOW it is her voice that keeps her from getting the major roles -- but I wish someone would really recognize her talents and give her a major role).I have always been a big fan of James L. Brooks, from his early work as creator of 'Room 222' and 'The Tracy Ullman Show' to Producer of Jerry Maguire, The War of the Roses, Big, Broadcast News, Terms of Endearment and Executive Producer of 'The Critic,' 'The Simpsons,' 'The Tracey Ullman Show,' 'Taxi,' 'Rhoda,' and last but definitely NOT least 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'  His writing and directing skills (particularly in this film) amaze and astound me; he is truly a gifted artist.It is too bad this came out the same year as Titanic -- it is a MUCH better film and really deserved the Oscar for best picture of 1998.",10,1,1,20 June 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," I laughed myself silly...
","I laughed myself silly but I am not sure I could recommend this movie to anyone.Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to be obsessed with body parts, functions and noises -- if you saw their movie 'Orgazmo' you will know what I mean.You probably already know the premise:  The South Park boys (Kenny, Kyle, Cartman and Stan)sneak into an R-rated movie and cannot stop swearing after seeing it.Of course the whole town is shocked and because the movie is Canadian the town decides to declare war on Canada!  It really was a funnier movie than 'Austin Powers:  The Spy Who Shagged me' but it is NOT a movie for kids by any means.  Thankfully the theater here checks ID and the entire audience was adults when we saw it.The co-dependent relationship between Satan and Saddam Hussein is one of the funniest things I have ever seen on film -- you feel sorry for Satan (almost).I did find the movie very funny -- but I could never really recommend it to anyone.In other words -- See It At Your Own Risk!",9,0,0,30 July 1999
Elizabeth," Maybe I was expecting too much....
","Elizabeth I has always been one of my all-time favorite historical characters.While this film is visually stunning the historical accuracy rates a Less Than Zero.Cate Blanchett was amazing as Elizabeth -- truly an amazing performance; and the FACES -- the casting director had a field day -- (almost) everyone looked just the way I thought they should look.The sole exception was Sir Richard Attenborough...  He looked terribly out of place for some reason.One VERY annoying feature of the film was the constant shifting from VERY dark to VERY bright fades.  Also the fading not to a soft haze but just BLURRY.  The person sitting next to me took off his glasses to see if they were dirty or if it was his eyes.It was extremely distracting and added nothing.Also everyone looked just too darn clean. They all had perfect manicures and haircuts.This was an age when women wore puppy urine as perfume because it smelled better than their unwashed bodies.Bathing was an annual affair and soap, as we know it, did not exist.But, in spite of its faults, the overall look was magnificent.",3,2,3,3 February 1999
Billy Elliot," Billy's excellent adventure.
","From the opening sequence where the soundtrack proclaims `I was dancing when I was twelve' to the last moment of this incredible film you will probably fall in love with Billy Elliott the character and Jamie Bell  the talented young actor that portrays him.This film is what all film should be and all too often is not:  story driven.There are no big flashy special effects, no car chases, no guns, and no overt sexuality.  There is some violence  but it is not gratuitous and is necessary to the plot and to the development of the characters into real people.Set in the coal mining district in the north of England, Billy's passion for dance is as unlikely as the existence of a snowball in hell: his family solves problems with their fists.Julie Walters, whom I did not recognize even though I have seen `Educating Rita' at least a dozen times, is fantastic as Billy's chain-smoking dance teacher that sees something in Billy that he does not see in himself.  As in most of her performances, she very nearly steals the show.But the show belongs to Jamie Bell.  Though he is actually 4 years older than the character he plays, he is the quintessential man/boy, forced to be an adult because times and situations are difficult.  Though this is his first film he carries the whole movie and appears in nearly every scene  and he carries it magnificently.There is much to this film  It is a simple story of a boy that wants to be a ballet dancer  but there are so many subtexts and complexities that it becomes so much more than the simple story it, at first, appears to be.Again, British cinema tackles a subject that is completely taboo to American film:  the subject of a young person's sexuality (see `Beautiful Thing'). It acknowledges that young people do have sexual feelings and they are often confusing and complex and not to be swept under the carpet or ignored.This is only screenwriter Lee Halls' second film  if he continues in this vein expect greatness.So too for Jamie Bell -- he has the makings of a true star, with a quality that leaps off the screen and into your heart.This is one of the finest films ever made and upholds the magnificent tradition that is British cinema.",10,0,0,21 November 2000
The Mummy," This one has EVERYTHING
","Brendan Fraser is the logical successor to Harrison Ford as the screen's newest action star.He has everything -- and he can actually act.He proved it in 'Gods and Monsters' but now he shows he can do action movies too.There was a lot of humour in this movie -- kind of 'Indiana Jones meets the Three Stooges' but it didn't detract from the story -- it just made it a lot more fun.The copious special effects added a lot to this tale of greed, mystery, and blunders.While this is not as great as the Indiana Jones films -- it is still a pretty good movie.",7,0,0,12 May 1999
Chicken Run," Pure 'poultry in motion.'
","How appropriate that the distribution company is Pathe -- a company that pretty much does not exist in the United States anymore -- whose logo is a rooster.One of the first clues that there are going to be a lot in-jokes and humour that not everyone will quite 'get' is right at the beginning: it is a shot of a rather miserable hut with the number `17' painted on the front; a quiet reference to the film `Stalag 17.'Quite a bit of the film is very British-oriented and American audiences may not understand the humour.  As an example:  `chocks' or `chockies' is British slang for chocolates.  When Fowler yells to `Remove the chocks.' it is the well-recognized triangular box of Toblerone chocolates that the hens remove that are used to block the wheels.Sight and word puns and gags abound -- far too many to remember let alone enumerate.One of the nicest surprises is Jane Horrocks, who essentially reprises her role as Bubble' from `Absolutely Fabulous' -- only as a scatter-brained chicken with a knitting addiction instead of a scatter-brained secretary.Julia Sawalha, also from `Absolutely Fabulous' fame, does a wonderful job voicing  Ginger' the motivating force and heroine -- or is that `henoine' -- of the film?This `Poultry in Paradise' film has something for everyone. the soundtrack is good, though not outstanding; but the animation is flawless.It is one of the few films I have been to where the (small matinee) audience cheered when the villains got what they deserved and most of the audience stayed through the end of the credits.It is a must see movie that is touching, funny and magnificently executed.",9,0,0,27 June 2000
X-Men," I want to see it again...
","I will pay this film my highest compliment:  I want to see it again.It was much more than I expected; especially after reading some lukewarm reviews about the characters that X-Men aficionados felt were missing, the special effects and other trivial minutiae.BUT  for someone (me) that has never read an X-Man comic and knew nothing about the characters, this is an exciting, well-told story with characters that had the boldness of comic book characters, all told in a visually gripping style.The story would appear to hinge on Wolverine but it makes a smooth transition to the real lynchpin of the plot.I am quietly grateful that Hugh Jackman was a last minute replacement for the actor that was originally scheduled for the part of Wolverine. He has an incredible intensity and screen presence that cannot be entirely attributed to his character.  He Rocks!Anna Pacquin as the mutant unsure of who she is and how she fits in  either in the Mutant society or the real' world  turns in a performance with just the right amount of angst' and still is believable and can be taken seriously.One of the naysayers in another review I read said that Halle Barry was misscast as Storm.  I disagree.  She is undeniably beautiful and looks more like a comic book hero (especially with her blonde mane) than anyone else in the film.Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters) was suitably chilling as the evil Magneto and Dr. Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) arch nemesis.Ray Park (Darth Maul from Star Wars) was supremely disgusting as Toad.  I ended up wishing he had more screen time.But what held this film together above all was the dialogue  there had to be a certain amount of exposition for the non-X-Men audience; but it had the basics of the story and moved the plot along at a steadily increasing pace.All things said I was not able to find many faults with this film and I cannot wait for the sequel(s).",10,0,0,19 July 2000
The Polar Express," See the 3-D version...
","An amazing film -- when you see it on an IMAX screen in 3-D.Though the film is somewhat lacking in story and not nearly as good as the book (by the same author as 'Jumanji'), there are certainly elements of the original story that are faithful to the original theme.Peter Scolari is resurrected from the 'Bosom Buddies' days of Mr. Hanks' legacy -- though the character he portrays is a dead ringer for Eric Per Sullivan from 'Malcolm in the Middle.'In the end credits Michael Jeter is the second person listed -- though he died over a year ago -- yet he had only a secondary part so listing him right after Tom Hanks was an homage to who he was; not what he contributed to the film.From very nearly the first scene in movie (at least in the 3-D version) you will be astounded. Everyone will have a favorite scene in which the special effects reign; for me it was not the train ride or the slide, it was all the elves ... how the animator could keep them all so individual yet so real.However, there is too much schmaltz and an obvious striving for a 'message' that gets in the way.'Peter Pan' and other films have done it better: Believe and it will happen.It has been done and said before -- in better and more entertaining ways.Not horrible -- but definitely a children's movie.",7,2,4,19 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," If you have any desire to see this film -- see it in a theater.
","This film is just too huge to wait to see at home -- even with the best home theater system.The panoramas, the sets, the scope, the battles and especially the SOUND will just not work anywhere but in a theater. So see it in a theater and hopefully, in a state-of-the-art theater with a digital projector and all the sound equipment that the amazing score by John Williams deserves.This is the film that clarifies many of the plot points in the other films in the Star Wars franchise -- to date it is the most important film as far as explaining what happened long ago in that `galaxy far, far away.'Since this film attempts to shed light on some of the gaps that left the audience wondering -- especially in Episode I: The Phantom Menace, there is quite a bit of lengthy exposition.  However, not all of it is necessary; a bit of judicious cutting would have been helpful. There is an obvious attempt to exonerate the pitiful character of Jar-Jar Binks -- he has little screen time and when he does appear he is much less annoying and more effective as a plot device. Christopher Lee is his spooky best as Count Dooku, the Jedi that has fallen to the dark side. He can always be relied on for an outstanding performance.
Natalie Portman (now Senator Padmé Amidala) has grown -- both as an actress and a character. She is surprisingly athletic and very easy to watch. 
Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) continues to develop into who Sir Alec Guinness became in the 1977 Star Wars film that introduced the franchise.Unfortunately the only thing that Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker) has going for him is his look.  He is not an actor -- yet.  He was the weakest element in the film.This is a huge, glorious film that will become just one piece in the Lucas Masterwork.  I can't wait for the completed totality.",10,0,2,4 June 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Bridget -- just as she is.
","One of the things that make this film so appealing and so good is the superb casting of absolutely everyone.Renee Zellweger is simply marvelous as the slightly daft Bridget Jones  unsure of who she is, whom she wants to be with, what she wants and how to go about getting it.  The character of Bridget is a bit of storm-tossed flotsam on the sea of life  going where the wind and waves take her and only occasionally taking charge of her own life.Colin Firth  Mr. Darcy in this film and in `Pride and Prejudice'  is dark, brooding and enigmatic: he seems as unsure of what he wants and whom he wants to be with as poor Bridget does.  He underplays his character; and his performance is all the richer for it.Hugh Grant is sublimely smarmy as Daniel Cleaver.  I understand how a woman could fall for such a jerk but you want desperately for them not to.The sound track is great: lots of old songs that evoke the mood and feeling that the film is trying to achieve.Though there is little overt nudity this film is rated `R' for language and sexuality.  I saw this film at a large metroplex theater and the girls in line in front of me bought tickets for a `G' rated film but after the obligatory stop at the concession counter made a beeline for 'Bridget.'  I don't think they were warped for life  but I have never heard the `F' word used more in any film.This is a wonderful example of a plot and story driven film.  No big splashy special effects just a story of a young woman's journey of self-discovery. I highly recommend it.",9,0,0,18 April 2001
American Pie," A coming of age sex farce for the 90's
","I wasn't sure I wanted to see this movie -- but after I went I was glad I did.This is a truly funny movie.Four High School senior boys make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night.The big question is will they, and eventually, do they really want to?While you could never say they are richly textured, fully dimensional characters they are very entertaining.A real standout performance is by Alyson Hannigan as Michelle the geeky band chick -- her 'In band camp...' diatribes were hilarious.No one was too pretty to be believable -- Seann William Scott as Stifler was the token pretty boy but he ends up as the one you may actually feel sorry for.  His good looks don't get him anywhere.The way the Internet is used almost as another character really brings this film into the 90's.  The humour is broad, unsubtle and always over the top but funny nonetheless.",9,0,0,28 July 1999
The Italian Job," Stylish. Classy. Clever.
","No one can play a slimy character as well as Edward Norton and he pulls this heist off better than ever before  he is able to make the viewer admire him and even envy him, yet be utterly happy that they are NOT him.This re-make of the 1969 film of the same name with Michael Caine and Noel Coward is far superior to the original  rare in this day of endless copies and re-makes. Mark Wahlberg plays the character that Michael Caine originally acted  and while Wahlberg is certainly not an actor of the same ilk as Caine is he is certainly more entertaining in this role than Mr. Caine was. He is written as intelligent, witty, charming and, even though Michael Caine epitomizes class, far more elegant and sophisticated than Mr. Caine was able to achieve in the initial film; kudos to Mr. Wahlberg.Charlize Theron is what I would want Cameron Diaz to be if I were ever lucky enough to wake up next to her  sexy, intelligent and just immoral enough to make her a truly fun romp. I totally approve.The supporting cast of crooks (Mos Def, Seth Green (!), Jason Statham and a woefully brief appearance by Donald Sutherland) is just delightfully fiendish enough to completely inveigle and entice the viewer to be completely caught up in their wicked, wicked ways.Whenever a film starts with a catchy and compelling opening sequence I am always wary  all too often it is a way of hiding the woefully inadequate film that is to come. Fortunately, even though `The Italian Job' started out on a high note, this time it did not let me down. It started cleverly and did not disappoint.The sound track was an absolute delight  hitting all the right elemental notes in all the right places  with themes that the viewer will recognize (in all the proper spots) mixed with new music that was completely appropriate to the action on the screen.Action is the key word. This was a film full of encounters and excitement  with never a slow moment or a let down.The use of the Minis as get away cars was a stroke of genius  where many screen writers or directors would have used a car a la James Bond the utilization of the not-so-exciting Minis gave an enormous sense of fun and exhilaration to the chase scenes.`The Italian Job' is the best time I have had at the movies so far this year and I highly recommend it to any and everyone that is looking for a good time replete with action, humour, romance and wit.",9,0,1,18 June 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ... a Tale becomes Legend, Legend becomes Myth ...'
","... and myth becomes movie.In this ambitious working of the J. R. R. Tolkien classic there is much to be admired.Yes, there are a few errors and omissions but how can a screenwriter (or a director for that matter) possibly condense the complete `Lord of the Rings' masterwork into three films and perfectly translate it into comprehensible film and still achieve the kind of quality that is seen here.I would have preferred to see four shorter films (released in both the summer and winter peak film seasons) rather than the three, three-hour films that we get.  It would not have been so overwhelming.Sir Ian McKellen is precisely what one would imagine Gandalf the Grey to be -- he does his usual outstanding job.  He is a genius at transforming written words into a real creature.Christopher Lee (Saruman the White) proves that the bad guys don't always wear black -- he is as capable as Sir Ian is.  Their `duel of the wizards' is a gripping scene that will leave you breathless.The special effects are over-the-top though at times they can be subtle -- hinting at what is to come rather than attacking the audience.  However, there are times when it does get to be too much -- the roller coaster effect is unsettling, at best.Creature makeup -- while probably mostly computer generated -- was horrifying, intense and shocking while the makeup on the actual actors was at times inconsistent.This is a huge film and will probably not translate well to the small screen; it should be seen in all its glory on the big screen. Oscar nominations will probably go for sound effects editing; it was inspired and brilliant.  So, if at all possible, see it in a good theater with a full range of Dolby Digital and DTS sound equipment.`Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is certain to become as classic as are the books upon which it is based.",9,0,0,11 January 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Ohana: family.
","If you choose to believe in the Disney tradition of family and all that it stands for, then this is THE film to see this year.Clever, charming, funny and witty are just pieces of what makes this film so good. The other parts are brilliant animation, superb background work and a sound track that is second to none.Not since the Disney film `Dumbo' has watercolour been used as background -- and never more effectively.The use of watercolour goes beyond effective -- it is magnificent. The backgrounds of the scenes envelop and surround the viewer with warmth and familiarity -- even if you have never been to Hawai'i.The voice casting is surprising -- yet so appropriate: Tia Carrere as Nani, Kevin McDonald as Pleakley, David Ogden Stiers as Jumba and the incomparable Ving Rhames as Cobra Bubbles the enforcer' are all completely correct.  As a film watcher you could not ask for anything more.  The only credit missing is Daveigh Chase as Lilo -- the heart and soul of this great film.There is much to praise here: the story, the animation, the soundtrack and all that makes a truly good film but suffice it to say that this if a film that you really do need to see. It will bring laughs to both children and adults and tears to anyone that has ever had an emotion.",9,1,1,2 July 2002
American Beauty," 'There is nothing worse than being ordinary....'
","Though this line (in one form or another) is repeated three or more times during 'American Beauty' these people ARE ordinary.There are many people living lives of quiet desperation; what makes the Burnham family different is their attempt to do something about it.But -- the characters are so finely drawn and realized by the actors that play those characters that none of their actions surprised me.The preoccupation with guns, the overt homophobia of Colonel Frank Fitts, the sexual boasting of Angela, the video-voyeurism of Ricky:  all add up to a predictable -- but no less painful -- conclusion.Surely half of the $15 million budget must have gone for the (American Beauty) roses -- which make an appearance in nearly every scene.The performances by Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bently, Mena Suvari (the part Alicia Silverstone would have played if she were younger), Chris Cooper and Peter Gallagher are all so precisely interconnected that there is a true ensemble feeling.  A special award should go to Allison Janney as the wife of Colonel Fitts:  She is so 'not there,' so vacant, so distant that it was a real acting tour d'force to play such a non-person.Take the incredible performances, the cinematography and superb editing and you have one of the finest films of this -- or any other year.",9,0,0,28 March 2000
Being John Malkovich," SO! That's where all those voices are coming from...
","There is little than can be said about this film without giving anything away.  So I find that I must restrain myself -- except to say that it is brilliant, thought-provoking, stunning, and WILL be imitated:  but not successfully.I applaud The John Malkovich for even allowing this film to be made.  Not to mention his incredible acting in it.It brings up the question of how does one play one's self?Astoundingly, in this case -- and, of course, who could do it better?Wonderful casting:  Orson Bean (!), Mary Kay Place and I quite honestly did not know that Cameron Diaz was in this film so I kept wondering who that familiar face was ... but didn't know until the final credits were rolling.Great cameos too:  Charlie Sheen, Brad Pitt, Sean Penn -- I laughed.John Cusak is, as always, on the edge of sanity -- but he does it so well.This will be a classic.  See it.",10,0,0,10 November 1999
Spider-Man," The sequel is already in the works.
","Peter Parker is supposed to be -- at least pre-spider bite -- a nerdy wallflower with little personality. That being the case Tobey McGuire was casting genius.I wanted very much to like the big-screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics hero `Spider-Man.' I'm not sure why but I was disappointed.The score by Danny Elfman was good -- but only in places.The script was entertaining -- but not consistently so.The photography was sometimes great -- but again, only at times.I believe that is why `Spider-Man' didn't win me over: It was inconsistent.The action scenes -- particularly when Spidey was flying through the air with the help of his self-generated webs -- moved too fast, taking away some of the Gee-Whiz factor. James Franco -- the son of the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, played by Willem Dafoe -- though up to the part was probably cast because of his cheekbones, making him actually look like he could be Mr. Dafoe's progeny.Kirsten Dunst was the best thing in the movie. Not to put too fine a point on things but especially for the scene in the rain and that sweater.There was lots of violence with a message that violence, in and of itself, can solve problems; not something I would want to teach a child.The movie seemed longer than its official run time of 121 minutes -- not a good sign.Not everything about this movie was bad.  Watching Peter Parker discover his new body and how he fumbled with learning to use his new powers was entertaining and the nice update of a genetically enhanced spider (from a radioactive spider in the comic book) was a good touch. The animation sequences were wonderful with the touch of the genius that is Stan Lee.If you are going to see this movie you should probably see it on the big screen -- or in the very least on a widescreen DVD -- the action is not going to fit on a small television set.",7,0,0,7 May 2002
54," A Study in Wretched Excess
","Unless you understand wretched excess this movie won't really mean much to you. An attempt was made to interject a bit of humanity into a cold and bleak period consumed by alcohol and drugs -- it doesn't work.When Salma Hayak does her big disco number her voice is so obviously dubbed it is pathetic -- the producers could at least have gotten someone that sounded remotely like her.The documentary that has been playing on television lately is far superior and gives a much truer view of that period of our history.No one, with the exception of Mikey Myers, could be accused of acting; however, he does an incredible job.",3,0,1,10 September 1998
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Magnificent.
","Finally, a Chinese language movie that mainstream America is going to watch and enjoy and forget they are reading sub-titles.There is a great deal here:  wondrous photography, a quiet but compelling soundtrack, special effects that are untouchable, a great story and script and gripping acting.This is one of those all-too-rare films that has both magical special effects and a great story; many movies of late sacrifice the story for the special effects  but the effects here add to the complexity of the story and enhance it.And the story is complex  There is a lot going on here; from unrequited love and passion, a mysterious and powerful sword, all-out action to quiet contemplation and peace.The martial arts scenes are over-the-top  transitioning quickly into quiet, serene moments of peace  the colossal change in mood, tempo and pacing is very effective.Chow Yun-Fat is at his serene best as Master Li Mu Bai and is perfectly complimented by Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien.  Ziyi Zhang as Jen Yu is superb as the young girl with enormous talent for the martial arts and Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox is her master that has been eclipsed by the student.The sound track is one of the most compelling I have heard in a long, long time  It is subtle and enhances the scenes instead of detracting from them. It is powerful yet quiet  much as the character Li Mu Bai is.The photography was beyond superb.  I just never knew what I was going to see next  from magnificent over-shots of the city of Peking, to the stark and barren desert wasteland that Lo (Chang Chen) inhabits to the verdant forest in which the best martial arts scene takes place.  This is a China that few people will ever see and it is worth going to the film just for the photography.I am so glad this film was not dubbed into English  hopefully it never will be.  To see the characters moving their mouths in the beautiful Mandarin language and hearing something else would be a crime.As I said above  there is a great deal here  too much to describe  it is a film that must be seen.",9,0,0,23 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Epic film making at its most spectacular.
","Director Peter Jackson has taken an `un-filmable' story and produced a true epic rich in the fantasy and myth that are inherent in the J.R.R. Tolkien books. There are naysayers out there that complain that the film doesn't follow the books  but it does  allowing for the vast scope and panorama of the original stories.The characters look and act exactly as I remember them from the books and the settings and scenes are far greater than what my poor imagination was ever able to conjure up. I was entirely prepared to not like this film; I was not completely sold on the first one. But Peter Jackson (director) and his wife Frances Walsh (screenwriter) have obviously poured their hearts and souls into this project  not to mention years of their lives and the effort shows.There are so many sub-plots and interconnected stories that it is near impossible to keep them all straight  but the tightly woven screenplay and the brilliant editing make it all work marvelously. There is not a miss-step or false note in the entire film. There were a couple of scenes that looked as if they could have been lifted right out of that other modern fairy tale: `The Wizard of Oz' but for the most part everything seemed original and fresh.Howard Shore's original score adds greatly to the overall feel of the film. It rises spectacularly at peak moments with a chorus of thousands' lending their talents and subsides quietly at moments of peace and tenderness.The Production Design and Art Direction (Grant Major and Peter Joe Bleakley, respectively) add to the grandeur and range that the film reaches for. The luminous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (not to mention the spectacular New Zealand settings) enhances the mystical and other-worldly' quality that the films strives for and achieves.This is a tightly woven piece of modern film making that should inspire filmmakers everywhere to strive for the best and hopefully, achieve it.",10,0,0,31 December 2002
Moulin Rouge!," `I'm paid to make men believe what they want to believe.'
","This is a `Cabaret' for the twenty-first century but without the original songs. Instead it builds  on the work of other genius -- which leaves it somewhat hollow at the core.  There is a great deal of genius -- here but it is borrowed genius: It is in the art direction, musical direction, lightening fast editing and the overall vision of director Baz Luhrmann. This film borrows from every known source: paintings, cartoons, with `Camille,' Satyricon,' and `Streetcar Named Desire' to name just a few of the film sources. Musically it is stunning.  But even more stunning is how other people's music is used to tell this story -- a story originally told by Alexandre Dumas. The choreography is amazing; particularly the routine set to Sting's Roxanne.' It is jaw dropping.John Lequizamo, as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, (especially when dressed as the sitar that could only tell the truth') is a brilliant piece of character acting.Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor do their own singing and they do it admirably.Everything is simplified: The Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh) is evil. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is good and Nicole Kidman is the woman of easy virtue.  It could hardly be more basic.The sets, costumes, makeup and overall visual feel of the film were outstanding. But there could be so much more.",8,0,1,18 February 2002
Mission: Impossible II," Mission Too Long: II
","All of John Woo's trademarks make their obligatory appearance in this Tom Cruise vehicle -- including being over-long.You certainly can not accuse anyone of acting in this action flick -- they are much too busy running, fighting or dying -- or looking faintly surprised that they are running,  fighting or dying.I really wanted to give this movie a chance -- some people whose opinions I respect said that they enjoyed it; but I had to keep resisting the urge to look at my watch.Even Thandie Newton, who played the catalyst/heroine was reduced to an object.  The first shot of her (which is repeated over and over) is just a shot down the front of her blouse.She does little more than seduce, decorate the set, and, at the end, look pale and wan.She does have one lone, solitary scene in where her character is not totally predictable.When `Mission Impossible' was on television it was obvious that while Peter Graves was the star it was clear that an ensemble was needed to solve whatever predicament the team found themselves in.Not so here -- this was more of a James Bond-type story.  No one else was needed.  Cruise was the only real character' in this movie.Both John Woo and Tom Cruise are capable of so much more than this movie -- which is only a money machine for both of them.At one point Cruise's character is asked a question:  His reply was `Risky'; if he had only said `Business' I would have found something in this movie to enjoy.",4,0,0,13 June 2000
The Mummy Returns," The very definition of an action/adventure film.
","Even though this film embodies everything that I think is so very wrong with film making today: not much story, too little plot and a reliance on special effects and action instead of talent  I still enjoyed it.It is hard not to get caught up in the whiz-bang exploits and fast paced story that are being told solely for your entertainment  and entertaining it is.It was great that the cast from 1999's `The Mummy' has all returned  As I said in my review for that film `Brendan Fraser is the logical successor to Harrison Ford as the screen's newest action star.'  And he shows he is still probably that successor.It is a real pleasure to watch Rachel Weisz  she is beautiful and she can act  at least as much as the script will allow.Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy/High Priest Imhotep) is fascinating to look at too There is something very compelling about his look and screen presence.  I would like to see more of his work.I did wonder if 'The Rock' (who know his real name is Dwayne Johnson?) was cast just to pull in a specific demographic...Speaking of demographics:  women consistently liked this film more than men did -- also something that I wondered about.There were many (maybe too many?) sequences where the heroes got away in just the nick of time; after a while it just didn't seem plausible.The sound track became somewhat annoying.  It was over-loud and because I was in an excellent theater with a superb sound system (and almost no audience) there were times when Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) would do something heroic and it sounded like applause had been dubbed into the background.This film borrowed heavily from many, many films  There were scenes that were right out of `Star Wars Episode I:  The Phantom Menace,' `ET: the Extraterrestrial,' `Murder on the Orient Express,' and far too many others to mention.But, going back to my opening paragraph:  I enjoyed it!",8,0,0,29 May 2001
Toy Story 2," Enjoyable; but...
","While I certainly enjoyed this movie it made me long for the days of 'real' animation.There were clever jokes, a lot of suspense and somewhat believable characters....But it all looked too plastic.  This is THE 'Toy Story' that Mattel allowed 'Barbie' to be in...  It fits. The movie is as plastic as she is.There was some clever writing -- but the 'jokes' were a little too predictable.The animation was perfect -- too perfect...  Real objects do not reflect off the floor or other objects the way these animated objects did.  Please note that I did not say characters... they simply became objects.It was just too polished; and therefore looked false. 
Most of the voices were instantly recognizable -- which doesn't add to the movie.My 'willing suspension of disbelief' was more than just challenged -- it was trampled.",5,1,3,25 January 2000
There's Something About Mary," There certainly is something about Mary.
","I just had to see this one twice -- it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  It is absolutely the best thing Cameron Diaz has ever done and Ben Stiller is magnificent.There are certain surrealistic qualities to this film that are very intriguing.  There are parts that are not for everyone -- some people walked out of the theatre at a certain point in the movie. However, if you can get over your possible initial discomfort and just sit back and enjoy Ted Stroehmann's (Ben Stiller) angst this is a great movie for the summer.Because of some of the content I was not certain if the person I went with would be comfortable or not -- but she loved it.I highly recommend this movie as the funniest movie of this year.",10,0,0,10 September 1998
Life Is Beautiful," A finely crafted gem...
","This small masterpiece of a film is an absolute delight to see.In even the most fantastic moments you WANT to believe.Roberto Begnini is brilliant.  After seeing several interviews with him he would appear to be the same person in every day life as he is in his film.Who would believe that a farce about the Holocaust could be made and not just realized but be entertaining and heart-warming as well:  'This is the sacrifice my father made for me...'Horst Bucholz has a very strange role -- is he mad? or is it the madness of the regime he is living under?All this said, this is one of the finest films I have ever seen.",9,1,3,9 February 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Just when you thought...
","Just when you thought it couldn't get any more complex or complicated this British film with overtones of `Trainspotting' will take you one step farther.The plot seems simple:  How to get money that is owed to a very nasty person.But with all things that appear simple there is amazing complexity. 
The dialogue may be difficult for many people to understand  it is true British working class  and a lot of it is very foul.There is an amazing amount of violence in the film.  So much so that you may even want it to be there when it isn't. There is a lot of hard-drinking, swearing and bloody violence  none of it subtle; but for some reason you still want to like the poor jerks that got themselves into the mess they did and hope that they get out of it intact.",9,0,0,30 July 2000
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Mystical, Magical and Magnificent.
","A near perfect film.With a run-time of 2 hours and 32 minutes this is an incredible piece of filmmaking.Though it is sometimes slow it is never ponderous but instead glorious.  It moves magnificently across the screen like an unstoppable force.It is never easy to make a film where children act the lead roles but Director Christopher Columbus achieves it with elegance and style. 
The characters of Hermione, Ron and, of course, Harry, were all brilliantly cast, as was the entire rest of the film -- especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape.  Wonderful faces and true characters just from the look of the actors.No amount of screen time or set element is too small; the attention to detail is superb and the overall feel' of the film evokes the magic and sense of awe and wonder that it should.It is magnificently photographed.  The scenes at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, in the U.K. could not have been a better location -- it is truly wondrous.The score by the master of film music, John Williams, is haunting and plaintive when it should be and stirring, robust and inspiring when the scene calls for it.The special effects are genius: worked into the story and adding to it but never detracting from it.  This is after all a story about magic!The lighting was inspired: the perfect interplay of light and shadow leaving just the right touch to the imagination; and in one scene when a character says It all became blackness' the screen flashes to white.
This is a film as much for adults as it is for children: there are some scary parts and some ironic humour and some clever word play. 
All in all Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is going to be one of the classics of filmmaking; I can't wait for the sequel.",9,0,0,28 November 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Reality is in the mind of the beholder...
","...or the person that defines that reality.Based on the true-to-life story of John Nash this film may have you questioning reality or your perception of it.This is Russell Crowe's film; he is in every scene and, in reality, surpasses the material.  He starts as a college freshman and by film end is a Nobel Laureate and is supremely believable.In order to define himself he needs other people (as do we all).  Ed Harris and Jennifer Connelly fulfill these roles sublimely.The film fulfills its role too.  Just as John Nash does the audience questions what -- and more importantly, who -- is real.In order for this film to work the audience must question what is presented to them as reality.  John Nash must do the same.Magnificent photography, great editing and an incredible soundtrack all add to the sense of (un)reality.Schizophrenia is a hard subject to tackle -- let alone film -- but Ron Howard takes Akiva Goldsman's script and does it well and, more important, believably.However, the audience must ask: What is reality and who defines it?",8,0,2,18 February 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Not a sequel -- but a continuation.
","Just as exciting as the first film this episode adds more humour and darkness to the story.With most of the same actors as the first film this latest edition of the `Harry Potter' franchise is just as visually exciting -- if not more so.Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint reprise their roles as the talented young magicians enrolled at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman and David Bradley return as the professors and staff at the school and are just as good as they were in the first -- though more of the focus of this episode is on the characters of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.  Kenneth Branaugh is a delightful addition to the cast as the egotistical and very inept Gilderoy Lockhart.The overall look and visual appeal is different -- though just as brilliantly executed as the first film.Once again the genius of John Williams provides the superb score that underlies the action and mood of the film.It was nice to see the film open with the very unsympathetic characters of Harry's Uncle, Aunt and cousin -- they added a strong link to the first film that would have been sorely missed were it not there.Christopher Columbus would seem to be a marvelous director of children's films -- apparently he understands the awe and amazement that a child would have if they were in situations similar to the ones that our heroes are in.This installment of the franchise is much darker and a great deal scarier than the first -- just as the book was.  I am not sure if it is suitable for all children; but if your children are mature enough to realize that this is just a film and they will not wake up screaming with visions of giant spiders and snakes -- then it will be appropriate for them.",9,0,0,26 November 2002
Ice Age," Great fun for everyone that has a sense of humour.
","With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job.They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping.The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's Manfred' being a particular treat.The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home.",9,84,107,14 May 2002
Bring It On," Surprisingly good little film.
","Before I knew anything about this movie the question presented itself to me: `How can a movie be written about such a trite subject as cheerleading?'Now the question is: `How could such a good movie be written about cheerleading?'If all you have seen is the television ads for this sweet little film you really have seen nothing about it.There is a very large cast but the characters are surprisingly well fleshed out (pun intended?).I was truly impressed and astounded by the choreography and sheer athleticism this incredible ensemble piece left me slack-jawed in amazement.Unfortunately the audience when I saw it was all young kids that not only talked throughout the entire film but also should NOT have been there because of the language and physical jokes.  This movie is probably aimed at kids -- and I know they have heard worse language -- but I wouldn't allow unsupervised children to see it.But, I liked it enough that I want to see it again; hopefully late at night on a weekday when the audience I saw it with are home in bed.I was genuinely surprised at how much I enjoyed this sweet little gem of a film.",8,0,0,15 September 2000
The Iron Giant," A classic
",I thoroughly enjoyed this animated film.While there are a few things I did not think were perfect they are too nit-picky to even mention.The moral messages were a bit heavy handed but over all what was being said was valid.I do wonder if a children's movie can be made any more without some kind of moral hitting you over the head.The characters were quite appealing and the story line is extremely well done.It does have you on the edge of your seat wondering just how it will all end.Some of the messages it imparted were a bit heavy handed for adult audiences -- and I do not think that kids would understand the whole 'Duck and Cover' routine.  In some ways I think it tries a bit to hard to appeal on a cross-generational level.But all being said I did enjoy this movie and what it was saying to anyone that saw and understood it.,9,1,2,17 August 1999
The Emperor's New Groove," Not Disney's best.
","While I certainly enjoyed `Emperor's New Groove' there was something lacking  This was not one of Disney's best.I loved John Goodman, Patrick Warburton and Wendie Malick's character voices  and they fit the animated roles perfectly  but for some reason the two most important voices Kuzco/Kuzco Llama (David Spade) and Yzma (Eartha Kitt) just didn't work In fact, they became irritating long before the hour and 18 minutes of this film was over.There is a lot to like in this film  though it does seem, at times, to be leftover footage from `The Road to El Dorado.'The colours are challenging, the character animation is blocky and the sound track is not what I expected; Sting doesn't really get a song until the final credits  long after the audience has left the theater.I was really hoping for more and I didn't get it.I like `The Road to El Dorado' and while `Emperor's New Groove' is definitely in that vein, Disney just isn't doing what it does best  entertain.",5,1,5,16 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Beyond epic.
","Faithful to the original book(s) by J.R.R. Tolkien this is an amazing achievement by director Peter Jackson and a crew of thousands -- well, at least hundreds.Visually stunning and amazingly photographed this film is a complete visual treat.  Much of the credit has to go to the dazzling editing -- seamlessly fitting several stories into one thematic whole.Much of what the viewer sees has been laid out in the books -- but it takes genius to realize the ideas and imagination and follow it so faithfully. 
While there are endless battle scenes, Director Jackson has a way of personalizing the struggles of the individual.  Because of this ability to personalize the, at times, overwhelming and seemingly endless scenes of battle are put in a more individual scale and makes them more accessible to the audience.This is a story of how absolute power corrupts absolutely -- and how even the desire of absolute power can corrupt. This is also a story of how an individual can make a difference and how friendship, self-sacrifice and brotherhood will persevere.Composer Howard Shore does an exemplary job of making the music fit the scene; using individual instruments to play upon emotions and the brilliant use of the human voice as an instrument.The `Wizard of Oz' came to mind a couple of times both visually and thematically. I could almost hear `I am the great and powerful Oz!'Miranda Otto does an outstanding job as Eowyn; remember: when you want a job done right send a woman to do it.Elijah Wood is exceptional as Frodo; showing the inner turmoil and obsession with possessing The Ring.Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagal is superb -- he embodies the power that The Ring has over the individual and how it possesses them body and soul.Even though this film is 3 hours and 21 minutes long the audience is always completely caught up in the action and adventure -- a stunning achievement.There are not enough superlatives to accurately convey the brilliance of this film -- it is one that will live forever in the hearts of all that see it.",10,0,1,5 January 2004
The Matrix," I don't usually like special effects movies, BUT
","WOW!I was very pleasantly surprised at this film.There is actually a very good and very dark story.The special effects only add to the story instead of detracting from it.All of the supporting characters turned in performances that were just a hair short of being truly great.Friends of mine that do not usually like either science fiction or special effects films liked it very much as well.And, as one of them put it 'Keanu Reeves does not ruin the movie.'This movie will not translate well to video -- the special effects and the sound (which was also incredible) just will not work on a small screen -- so I strongly suggest that you DO NOT wait for it to come out on video and see it in a theater with the sound system that will support this movie.Enjoy.",9,0,0,8 April 1999
Tarzan," Do NOT wait for this to come out on video ...
","From the opening sequence to the end of the credits, this is a masterpiece...This is a great movie with incredible animation and music.Phil Collins did a magnificent job on the music.  Not any real catchy or hummable tunes but the songs that are there make the story complete.I do not like going to a film with an audience full of children but because this movie is so entertaining all the children (three-fourths of the audience) were totally mesmerized.The animation was breathtaking.I happened to run into Joe Pantoliano (Matrix) right after the movie and he was as thrilled as I was.Only the people in this film were cartoonish ... the apes and the jungle were more than real ... I was thrilled.The way violence was handled was brilliant -- there was never any blood -- except in one of the very early scenes and it would be missed by most people.All death was handled discretely -- with all of it happening off screen -- with one exception.This movie may be too intense for young children but I highly recommend it for adults.",10,1,1,23 June 1999
Gladiator," 'He will give them death and they will love him for it.'
","I did not know movies like this were made anymore -- or even could be made.The production values go beyond lavish -- this is truly a Hollywood Spectacular.Somebody really did their homework -- every detail was brilliantly executed. However the Romans of that period in history did not have tempered steel (which made its debut in the 14th Century) but is sure looked better on screen than the iron or bronze weapons the real gladiators would have carried.There is true genius in this film:  costuming, photography, art direction and most of all the acting and direction.Ridley Scott outdid himself.  The sheer size, scope and grandeur are breathtaking.Russell Crowe heads an incredible international cast that had to truly believe in this film to achieve the greatness that the audience sees on the screen.Whoever did the matte paintings (no credit given) be they on the traditional glass or CGI deserves a special mention.  They transport the viewer to a place that is so unreal it becomes real.In the credits there is a brief homage to Oliver Reed -- who died the day after the film was released in the United States... I do not know how they worked that credit into the release that I saw but I do appreciate it.This is an instant classic and will go down in filmatic history as 'A Movie For All Time.'",9,0,0,21 May 2000
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," A rock-em, sock-em tour d'force for everyone involved...
","I (kind of) remember when I first saw this film  it was not in the theater but probably on videotape or possibly on television.I didn't like the portrayal of the Nazi's then; they were much too cartoonish  their true evil didn't come through  they were something to be ridiculed and laughed at for their buffoonery.Well, they still are.  But now, after seeing this film on the big screen, it doesn't matter!This whole film is a filmed comic book  the Nazis are supposed to be cartoonish; the violence is not real, the situations are totally impossible  but that doesn't mean that it is any less a great film.Once again Indiana Jones fights the ideology that is the Nazis and, of course, wins.He has the requisite number of close escapes and near-death experiences that allows the viewer to suspend the plot holes and lapses in continuity that are rampant in this truly one-of-a-kind film.Harrison Ford could not have been better cast as Indiana Jones (you will find out how he got his name in this installment) and he takes the story and runs with it.Sean Connery is incredible as his father  the real humour starts the first time he appears on the screen.There is amazing attention to detail (note the name of the ship that Indy is trapped on in the opening sequence) and the characters are actually fully developed and finely drawn.Allison Doody (who could live with a name like that?) makes her last major screen appearance as the evil Dr Elsa Schneider  what happened to her and where is she now?This, apparently the last of the Indiana Jones films, is not exactly the best way to finish a franchise  but it could be much worse.  I enjoyed every minute of it.",10,1,1,6 March 2001
