Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertaining to non Star Wars fans, satisfying to die-hard fans.
","'The Phantom Menace' does a wonderful job of entertaining those who don't know all of the intricacies of the 'Star Wars' series.  However, Menace has sufficient dialogue, plot events, and undertones that will satisfy the die-hard fan.There is not as much foreshadowing as I expected, but Lucas dangles a few carrots that will lead into the next movie(s).  Also, I was pleased with the fact that while 'Menace' has great special effects, Lucas has kept them from being the focus of the movie.Overall, 'Menace' is a great movie, but I have doubts that this will become a classic as did the original 'Star Wars'.",9,1,3,12 May 1999
