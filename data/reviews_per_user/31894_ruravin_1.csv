The Hangover," Funniest 'guy movie' since Wedding Crashers
","Absolutely loved this movie. The theatre was all laughs through the whole movie. Don't go expecting a cinematic masterpiece but if you are looking for out of control laughter this is your flick. The story was funny the acting was hilarious and I don't want to spoil it but the end was so funny my wife hurt her ribs (no I'm not kidding) from laughing so hard. I am going back to see this movie again. And I don't do that often, but for any guy with a sense of humour or has ever been to a bachelor party (or can't wait to go to a rockin' bachelor party) this is a must see movie.",10,172,346,6 June 2009
