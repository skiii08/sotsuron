The Longest Yard," Fun overall, nothing special
","I must say that this film is funny, even though I was reluctant to watch it. The reason for me being reluctant to watch it is that the typical comedy by Adam Sandler features him being a total jerk and then yelling uncontrollably which makes the audience laugh incredibly hard.I'm not saying he doesn't do other things in his films, but generally that's the impression I get, and it could be funny, but the problem is that it gets played out over time. I'm not here to comment on Adam Sandler though, there's other people like Chris Rock, Nelly, etc. etc.So back from digressing, the film is about a football game between the prison guards and the prisoners. That's the basics, and while this is not generally funny, it manages. It is incredibly funny at times with little shocking things twists and turns that generally are needed within comedies.I suppose I can say that this film went nowhere really. There's no overall moral (well there is one, but it's not strong enough to even be remembered). The jokes are not intelligent, and I generally wouldn't recommend this movie if you do like intelligent comedy.The movie was fun to watch, but it was nothing special or innovative.",6,0,2,30 June 2005
War of the Worlds," Excellent film, above average, but didn't pull through.
","This film was great as far as the entertainment issue went. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is quite interesting.I then stop and think, why I'm saying this and if it's because of the actual story or the magnificent special effects? I think it's a good mixture of both in my opinion, but the special effects seemed a little overwhelming at times. I don't think the special effects should be so overdone that while watching the movie I say, 'Wow, those special effects were really good!' I guess what I'm trying to say is that the special effects took me out of the movie at times.The directing was good, it's Steven Spielberg, but it wasn't anything innovative in my opinion.I haven't had any past experience or knowledge of any 'War of the Worlds,' so this is all coming from a newcomer's perspective, but I can say that I talked to others who watched it, and they agreed with me.The film will make tons of money, because it was super-overly hyped, but I think it falls short of the expectations that were instilled in our head during interviews, trailers, and such. The movie is great, but it isn't the best and quite possibly not even near.I did like the fact that the film does only tell the story through the point of one character and his family (Tom Cruise's Family). I also really enjoyed that throughout the whole movie I didn't feel like I was watching a sequel to Independence Day, which I though would be the biggest problem. The movie sets itself apart from Independence Day, which I think helped it a lot.Overall it was a great film, I definitely recommend it to everyone, but be warned that it is not as great as the trailers and the media have told us.",8,3,7,2 July 2005
