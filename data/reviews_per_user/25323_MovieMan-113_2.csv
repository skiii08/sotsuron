Walk the Line," The Best Picture of 2005!
","I first heard about this film on the internet way back when it was announced that they were going to make the biopic of Johnny Cash. I didn't think too much of it and, as months went by, I started becoming more and more interested in it. I thought Joaquin Phoenix was great in a lot he had done since 'Gladiator' and was becoming a fan. Reese Witherspoon I aways saw as a girl next door type so I was up in the air with her playing June Carter.When I finally saw a preview of the film, I immediately wanted to check it out do to my curiosity and speculation. Something inside me wanted this to be good so I checked it out. I was hooked from beginning to end and I even found myself toe-tapping to the music(I am not even a fan of country!). The performances are outstanding with both Phoenix and Witherspoon at their career defining best. I am pulling for both to win the Oscars for Actor and Actress, but am shocked to find out it isn't up for Best Picture! It's an outrage!!! Because whether the Academy agrees or not(apparently, not) this IS the Best Picture of 2005!!! See it for an entertaining story, music, drama and overall great film!",10,3,5,2 March 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," This Film Will Stay With You Forever!!!
","I watched the original film a week before seeing the remake and was not so surprised by how different they were. I love this movie!!! It had everything I had hoped for! Blood, carnage and jolts! I hate to admit it, but I jumped at least five or six times during this showing! I could not believe how much they got away with when watching it as well! I especially thought the acting was great from Ted(Silence of the Lambs)Levine to Kathleen(Apollo 13)Quinlan. Even 'Lost' star Emilie de Ravin was exceptional as Brenda. And what can I say about Aaron('X2: X-Men United')Stanford as Doug Bukowski, fighting through Hell to get his daughter back. When I realized that this was the same actor who played Pyro in 'X2', I couldn't recognize him! He was awesome!!! Then I found out that Billy Drago was in the film and was blown away!(no pun, if you've seen the film). It was great to see the guy who played Frank Nitti in 1987's 'The Untouchables' still getting mainstream work! Congrats to Alexandre Aja and Wes Craven for bringing back a film that truly exceeds and is a whole lot better than the original classic!!! SEE IT!!!!!",8,0,0,18 March 2006
