Walk the Line," Great movie
","This wasn't top of my movie list on what to see at the cinema but i went last night and it was actually one of my favourite movies i have seen at the cinema in a long time. i had no knowledge of johnny cash, and i had never heard any of his music, but i had heard of him. my girlfriend wanted to see it so i went with her. and i really enjoyed the story. the acting was absolutely superb. as i had no knowledge of johnny cash, i couldn't tell you whether joaquin phoenix was doing a good job, but his acting was spot on for me. and it was very touching. i thoroughly enjoyed myself and would recommend it to anyone even if you are my age. I'm 18, and johnny cash was way before my time, but it was a fantastic movie",7,0,0,15 February 2006
It," Pennywise is the money maker
","So for a person who isn't really a big horror movie fan, for some reason this movie was something I HAD to see. The marketing for this film was extraordinary, and I was well and truly sucked into the hype. I'm a guy who tends to watch a horror film with the lights on, pillow in hand just in case i need to shield my eyes, and the volume down in case anything makes me jump ..... OK I exaggerate with the pillow and lights on, but I do turn the volume down when I think something bad is going to happen.But horror stories often bring out the most imagination. Horror has the most amount of versatility in the world of storytelling. Superhero movies are all very similar nowadays. Action films are too samey as well. Comedies are running out of jokes. But Horror movies have always got a new way of scaring you. Yes obviously there's the awful horrors out there, but so many recently have been exceptional. It's such a shame I don't like it when something makes me jump! As I love the story of a good horror movie/book, but usually too wimpy to watch it.'It' was different though. I know it's a re-boot, but I was excited for this, and I was surprised at how little I jumped and got scared. I didn't find it scary. I just found it to be one of the most fun movies I have seen at the cinema in a very long time. Last time I enjoyed a movie this much at a cinema I believe, was for Dark Knight in 2008. Funnily enough that had a clown character as a main protagonist too.The characters were well cast and the kids more than held their own when Pennywise wasn't in shot. There was great chemistry between the kids, and the majority of them had great acting talent. Maybe the odd dodgy acting here and there, but overall the kids made this movie better than certain people expected. Pennywise was the main draw though. He still steals the scenes which isn't too surprising. The first meeting with him and Georgie is chilling. His shapeshifting, strange ways and often comedic mannerisms actually make for creepy viewing, but he never becomes unbearable. He is always fun to watch. It's a horror/comedy, but knows its purpose. The comedy isn't forced or overbearing, and when it tries to scare you, it doesn't dull it down for comedy sakes. It just becomes funny when it needs to. And it scares when it needs to. The balance of this was spot on, and this was the biggest success of the movie. At just over 2 hours too, it never ever feels drawn out. The time between meetings of Pennywise never seems too long or too short.If I had a criticism (which there isn't many), it would be that Pennywise was not in it enough. Just as in the first scene with him and Georgie, he got a lot of screen time. But afterwards, we saw him in patchy stages, which never lasts long enough (maybe apart from the end). But that's just me being selfish. Also the CGI spoilt a couple scenes, but again that is being picky. The movie was lots of genres in one. Horror, Comedy, Drama, Action. And it does all of that very well. I haven't given this a 10, as I can't say I believe in the perfect movie, and will only give a 10 to my all time favourite film, but 9 is perfectly good.Pennywise will go down as one of my fave movie characters. Along with Heath Ledgers 'Joker' and Johnny Depps 'Jack Sparrow'. Bill Skarsgard definitely does 'Pennywise' justice.Loved it. So looking forward to Chapter Two!!",9,2,3,26 September 2017
Se7en," Wow. What a brilliantly crafted movie
","i haven't a bad word to say on this movie except the fact that it may have been a wee bit slow for my liking but that doesn't falter the acting skills, the horror and the sheer genius script in this movie. kevin spacey was totally terrifying and brad pitt was in his best role and i don't rate him very highly as an actor. watch troy, you'll know what I'm talking about. morgan freeman delivers yet another masterpiece and seven is simply the greatest serial killer movie of all time. forget scream and the shining. seven is simply a one and only movie. as a matter of fact i think I'm gonna watch it now. i rated it nine purely because i believe that every movie has faults even if they are hard to see and there is no such thing as a perfect movie. but this is easily my 3rd favourite movie of all time after Back to the Future and Jurassic Park.",10,0,1,27 July 2005
Constantine," Bitterly disappointed
","it was an OK film i suppose but after reading a lot of good reviews i was looking forward to an early blockbuster hit. i was wrong. OK admittedly the special effects were quite impressive for a february release and the acting from rachel weisz was very good. keanu reeves on the other hand was awful. does he just act off of a teleprompter? it may as well be like he's reading a book or off a piece of paper. he is a diabolical actor and doesn't deserve the high standard of actor. he is worse than his sidekick chas in the film. chas (real name Shila laBoef) was quite good as a sidekick. he was a good entertaining character. but john constantine was dull and dreary. very borin. I've seen laBoef in a few other films such as I, Robot (bit part) and Holes. (i think that was him). and he really showed potential in I, Robot to be the next smooth talking actor on the big screen. like Colin Farell cos he sounds like he is confident and he is realistic with the way he acts. this boy has a great deal of potential and talent. he shud go far. but the film is entertaining in parts like the computer effects and the bath scene but everything else went out the window. literally. there was many plot holes. very much disappointing but it is worth the watch if ur into the Gothic tales of hell and the devil. 6 out of ten for the graphics",6,5,10,21 July 2005
Django Unchained," Enjoyable, but just don't seem very Tarantinoish
","This starts out like a typical gritty, unconventional Quentin Tarantino movie. No rules, no clichés and fully reliant on mood, script and superb acting. It sets the stage for the rest of the film. But then it kind of goes off track after the Saloon scene, but this doesn't deter from the quality of the film, it just feels a little less like a Tarantino movie.Waltz and Di Caprio are just superb in their roles. Foxx holds his own, but you can tell his role was meant to be for someone else.The final 3/4 of this film really is quite clichéd and muddled. A little predictable, and slightly lazy. Yes the script is razor sharp, acted superbly, and I haven't heard a better script all year, but it still felt a little laboured and that a few scenes were picked out of a hat and just thrown in. The bag head scene is hilarious, but it looked like they plucked it from Blazing Saddles and threw it in. I can't fault it because it made me laugh, but in all honesty it didn't need to be in the movie.There are moments where QT shows his magic, like the dinner scene with Candie, Schultz and Django ... That is classic Tarantino, and I loved that scene. The saloon scene in the beginning is also brilliantly put together and Waltz outdoes himself and deserves his Oscar for that alone. But the rest of the film just plods along with no real direction.Sam Jackson's character is also quite a laughable one, virtually mocking himself. He knows the character is a joke, so he does his best to play it out that way.But overall, the film is just popcorn fun. Top quality script, acting, sets and the final shootout is QT at his glorious and hilariously over the top best. It's not his best (still think Reservoir Dogs needs topping) but certainly not his worst",7,0,3,17 October 2013
Jurassic World," Great fun but not without its flaws
","Not really any major spoilers, but really depends on the overviews you have read about the film.Jurassic World is a movie I have been looking forward to since I found out last year it was being made. For me, I don't remember being this excited about a movie since War of the Worlds back in 2005.I knew it wouldn't be as good, or as original as the first Jurassic Park, but I did expect it to be better than the sequels. They did have 14 years between the 3rd and 4th installment so they had plenty of time to do it right.I won't go into the synopsis, as you can figure out the gist of the story from many reviews and summaries, but the story for me wasn't a great start. I thought the idea of a hybrid dinosaur was a little far-fetched (clearly a dinosaur movie isn't far-fetched enough) and it needed to show a bit more originality. But I went in to it with an open mind, and hoped the actors could deliver the same amount of charm as the originals did and I am glad to say that at least Chris Pratt did that.The rest of the movie was just a typical popcorn fun film. But it was simply a monster movie. It didn't really feel as though it was a Jurassic Park entry. Jurassic Park had the excitement but it made it suspenseful with scenes like the first meeting of the T-Rex, the electric fence, and the Raptors in the kitchen. Those three scenes for me epitomizes Jurassic Parks classic tag. This one doesn't really have anything suspenseful, apart from maybe the very first 'action'sequence with the Raptors. After this, the introduction of the new dino is a little tame, and the rest of the film is just typical dino carnage and you know when the attacks are going to come. Some of the aspects of the film were a little ridiculous too, like being able to teach the Raptors. That's the fairly negative part out of the way. The positives are that this movie is a major improvement on both sequels. I have rated it an 8 because it was just a fun movie to watch, and the effects were great. I liked that the park was fully functioning, and being a big theme park fan, I enjoyed watching all the attractions come to life like a proper theme park. The classic JP soundtrack was in there too which was great and they threw back to the original movie very nicely, and gave the original a glowing reference. Chris Pratt was a highlight of the film, as he carries the other actors through, but the biggest compliment I can give Jurassic World is that it made me feel like the Jurassic Park series was back to stay. The original is in my top 10 movies of all time, and this installment will not disappoint many fans of the series. Some will be cynical, some will just plain dismiss it because it isn't original. But it never was going to be, it was just a brilliant way to spend 2 hours, and kept me entertained right until the end credits. I would recommend to anyone who liked the previous 3 movies, or monster movies in general.",8,0,5,5 July 2015
War of the Worlds," thought it was an enjoyable movie
","this starts off as a normal Hollywood block buster. tom cruise working and going to pick his kids up. then disaster strikes. the first computer effects scene in this is possibly the best i have ever seen. fast furious, brutal, scary, impressive, violent. everything i could hope for. then it slows down a tad when they flee the tripods but it then builds up momentum again. i built this movie up so much, i was scared i would be disappointed because i was thinking it would be a great movie. speilbergs best. unfortunately it wasn't but it was still very good. excellent acting, very believable story and very impressive cgi. it was scary in parts. the first scenes of violence had me on the edge of my seat. although there is not much blood or guts pouring out over the place, it is still a very violent movie. I'm thankful they kept to the story originally told in the book. because even though the ending was a bit rushed, it was what was in the book. overall an 8 out of ten because the scenes of violence and action were out of this world but the oglivy scene spoilt it a bit. but still the greatest sci fi I've ever seen",8,0,2,14 July 2005
Kong: Skull Island," Basically a better Jurassic Park 3
","I'm not going to go into why this movie is not as good as it should be. Apart from the fact they have totally miscast some characters (Hiddleston especially) and the movies saving grace was John C Reilly, Kong: Skull Island was actually pretty entertaining.I went into this knowing it'd be very Hollywood, so I expected nothing less. Why people were expecting more is beyond me. We knew the characters would be clichéd. We knew that Kong would reign supreme. We knew we'd see a load of weird creatures (one thing I hate about the Kong story is the creatures, but I know it has to be there). The story is what it is, it was never going to be some superb script up for Oscars and stuff. Yes, Hiddleston and Larson are beautiful people so we knew they would just be there for eye candy. All I wanted to see was a good Monster Movie, and luckily for me I got it.The story reminded me of Jurassic Park 3. Lots of things were similar, with the Kong spin. Someone lures them all to the Island for one reason, then knowingly tells them it was all for a different reason. They go on the hunt for someone on the Island. There was even a boat they used to try to escape and a few other nods too. It was all very similar to me, but obviously a lot better.Reilly stole the show when he eventually showed up. Hiddleston was a horrendous choice, but I usually like him. Jackson just turns up anywhere nowadays, so his presence in films now really doesn't excite me.Overall, this movie does what it sets out to do. No it isn't perfect but if you go into it expecting a classic, you will be disappointed. One thing I will say is I much preferred this to the 2005 Kong. Apart from the small snippet where Kong came to NYC in the 2005 version, the rest of that movie for me was terrible.",7,0,1,29 May 2017
The Woman in Black," Woman in Black is gold
","For someone who has read the book, watched the stage play and briefly seen the TV adaptation, I had high hopes for this movie as soon as I knew it was being released. Wasn't sure about Radcliffe but I was willing to give it a chance, and I am now prepared to say I was wrong to doubt him. He carries this film extremely well and I totally forgot he was Harry Potter in former life. Fair enough there were a few 'wooden' moments but in all, his expressions and acting was faultless. The movie itself was at just the right pace. An eerie slow burner, making the audience tense and always looking for when the next scare will be. There were a fair few jump moments that many people criticised but for me, they were needed in a film like this. There were plenty of eerie spine chilling moments too that didn't need the use of a jump scare, so they evened each other out.It was pretty loyal to the book, apart from a few minor details, and of course the ending is totally different. But the premise of the movie stayed the same. The ending for me was a good idea, but it lacked the shock factor that I believe it needed for my 8/10 to rise to 9/10. It left me feeling a little disappointed.The sets, scenery, acting and the house especially were fantastic. The woman also doesn't disappoint. When seen, she got the whole Cinema screaming, something I have never seen in a Cinema ... Even Paranormal Activity 1 & 2.Overall, the movie was very good. Didn't scare me, but it certainly made me jump and gave me the creeps. Disappointed with the ending, but there were plenty of well done scenes (Rocking Chair moment especially) to make up for it.",8,2,7,23 February 2012
The Purge," Waste of a great plot
","The premise and idea of this story is excellent if not flawed, but a very interesting idea none the less. It starts with a family who seemingly support the idea of an annual 'purge' where people can cleanse their inner demons and take part in any act of violence, including murder, and not get punished. The idea is terrifying, because it does raise the question 'would this work in our society?'. The answer of course is no, because of the financial implications and morality, but still raises that question.The family in question are wealthy, and not particularly likable so the audience don't really have a chance to sympathise with them when things go wrong. Once the barriers are up, that's where the tension is supposed to start. It doesn't really get off the ground. The kid lets a stranger in to try saving him, and suddenly the family are under attack from some bloke who wouldn't look out of place in a boyband. Yes the masks are a bit freaky, and the actions of those around the villain are a bit creepy, but in all honesty, this is not a scary or tense film. It ends up being a home invasion film, and completely forgets its own plot, (a fairly original and interesting plot) and then wastes its potential.There are twists, about 20 minutes in, then again at the end of the film, and both of which are easy to figure out.The villain is cheesy, clichéd and in no way menacing. The end of the film is rushed, and so much more could have been made of this.Glad i didn't go to the cinema to watch this, because I would have been disappointed, but it gets a 5 for the idea, the masks and the fact that it does beg the question 'would an annual purge, reduce the crime rate for the rest of the year?'. My opinion is no, but I'm sure some may disagree.",5,0,0,16 October 2013
Sin City," Nothing else like this
","When i started watching this movie, i didn't know what to expect from it because some of my friends love it, some hate it. some say its overrated, some say its this years best film. so i really had no clue on what to expect. but when i saw it for the first time. i was amazed. the special effects in this movie were brilliant. the film actually makes you appreciate colour television. it blends in the little arrays of colour into the black and white majority excellently and the brutality comes by the masses. this truly is the greatest comic book adaptation ever made and it is a comic book put on screen. the car chases and violent scenes are unbelievable. most of the actors put in great performances. Mickey Rourke is perfectly cast as Marv. Bruce Willis puts in an effortless performance as hartigan, but doesn't look like he's pushing 60 like it says. Elijah wood is brilliant as Kevin and is a truly chilling character without uttering a word throughout the film. and watch out for a little cameo role from the man frank miller himself. overall this movie is a modern classic as there is nothing else like it and it is only a 9 because i believe Benicio del Toro and Clive Owens performances were pretty bad.",9,0,1,27 September 2005
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Total Shambles
","Unfortunately this movie is not the final movie of the trilogy we had been waiting for. Its too long, over the top, pointless and takes a good hour for people to actually understand what the plot is.It starts off with a neat and clever little homage to American history that promises so much more than it delivers. Then it gets messy! We see our hero for the first time with his new girlfriend. And this is where the special effects is most impressive because those lips are surely not real? But she is easily the most beautiful thing about this film. It is RHW that stopped me from leaving prematurely. Not for her acting ability of course. But cue a bunch of random explosions and slow motion action sequences that seemingly have nothing to do with the story. No character development, the script is terrible and some of the one liners are cringe worthy. Throw in a couple of big name actors and actresses that have no reason to be there, but maybe good actors can salvage the mess? No they can't. Alan Tudyk is probably worth one star in this movie. But not enough to make a bad script work.Shia disappointed me in this too. I always thought he had brilliant presence and charisma as an actor, but maybe because of a lack of story, direction and script it ruined his last outing as Sam Witwicky.Yes the cars are gorgeous, RHW is too, the special effects are impressive, but only in the chase scene on the highway which was, might I add, a carbon copy of the first Transformers movie. All other effects lacked something I can't quite put my finger on. The ending is a joke too. It is no more than anyone expected but although the film was about an hour too long, the ending seemed horribly rushed.But thank god this is the last one at least for Michael Bay. Just because your making a movie with fast cars, beautiful women, explosions and spectacular SFX, doesn't mean it'll be any good! 3 out of 10 for Alan Tudyk, SFX and RHW's lips!",Null,4,10,4 August 2011
Back to the Future," My all time favourite movie
","wow. how do i put my opinions of this film into words. it is my favourite movie purely cos its fun, entertaining, understandable but with a bit of a mind tester the first time u see the trilogy but it has the certain spark many other movies don't. michael j fox became my fav actor after this movie. even tho i was only 8 when i first saw it. its the only movie that i can watch over and over again without getting bored. this is a timeless classic with comedy, science fiction, action, special effects and adventure all packed into one. this is an almost perfect movie even tho i cant see what could be improved. but nothing is perfect is it. this is very close. I'm pretty sure everyone has seen it but if not. get out there and watch this. it will blow u away. it is absolutely outstanding cinema",10,1,2,21 July 2005
