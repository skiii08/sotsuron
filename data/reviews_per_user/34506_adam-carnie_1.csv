Deepwater Horizon," Mark Wahlberg & Kurt Russell Outstanding
","To start, the attention to detail from shot to shot was sublime. I was glued from start to finish. What they have managed to do here is not go overboard with the story, it works for the memories and the accounts of those who were involved in the real deal.Wahlberg and Russell, an absolute respect to their roles. In fact like every other actor and extra, hat's off to you including the entire staff on this film.This film was made to perform. It delivers on a huge scale.I tend to write reviews in short, a brief to say what was overall great and if it lacked any quality, this film hasn't.",9,1,3,2 October 2016
