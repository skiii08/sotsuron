The Ring," Not for the faint of heart... you may die if you watch it.
","Despite being a remake of a Japanese film, 'The Ring' definitely holds the spot for one of the scariest films of the last few years.  The cinematography is quite impressive, and several paranormal scenes give you the chills and will, in fact, get you to squirm in your seat.  Watch it with someone because you will need an arm to hold when Samara makes her moves... just thinking about it makes me shiver.Those who 'didn't understand' the plot of the movie are not to be paid attention to.  They expected to be spoon-fed the plot instead of having to actually think about what's happening.  I understood the film in its entirety.",8,0,0,14 November 2002
