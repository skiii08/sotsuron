The Ring," Not Terribly Scary, Just Terrible
","A good marketing campaign made this a hit, showing screaming teens in theatres ...when we saw it, people were laughing.  WE were laughing!  The plot is nonsense and the genuine scares amount to nothing more than a few minor jumps in your seat.  The rest of the time you're left to wonder what on Earth is going on in this movie.  If it had been filmed in black and white and everyone had spoken Swedish, it probably would have been hailed in America as a masterpiece.",1,2,7,1 December 2002
