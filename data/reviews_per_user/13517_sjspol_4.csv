First Man," Great Biopic!
",Best biopic in years. Engrossing from start to finish. Armstrong's personal life was as interesting as his space ventures. The editing of the movie was first rate. Even though the movie covered a long timespan in Armstrong's life the transitions were seamless. The photography was also outstanding. You actually felt as though you were inside the cramped capsules. I'm not a big Ryan Gosling fan but he was perfectly cast in this movie. His performance was low key just like Neil Armstrong. I think his performance is Oscar worthy. Claire Foy was also terrific as his wife. As a history of our space ventures I would rate this movie in the same category as 'The Right Stuff'. Hard to believe all the transpired in the film including the moon landing was about a half century ago.,9,5,11,21 October 2018
Passengers," Disappointment
","Trailer looked promising the movie did not turn out to be. Poor excuse for a holiday release. Only good things were the space travel special effects and the android bartender. Movie took way to long to develop. First 30 minutes could have been edited out entirely. Script was lame and the two stars were wasted on a boring plot. I was expecting some kind of a plot twist that never happened. Once you found out what was going on with the ship it was a very routine and predictable story line. Bad script choice by what are normally fine actors. The ending was lame and hard to believe. Not worth your, time pass this one by. One of the worse science fiction movies released in quite some time.",4,12,27,23 December 2016
Green Book," Uplifting Experience!
","What a great gift of a Christmas movie and more! In this time of division, anger and hatred, this picture offered hope and a look at how people can overcome their differences and bigotries. What makes it even better is that it's based on true events. The script was exceptional and the editing moved the storyline along seamlessly. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali were pitch perfect in their respective roles. Oscar worthy movie and performances. I would urge anyone who would like a positive and inspiring experience to go see this movie. So rare these days.",9,8,18,7 December 2018
Sully," Oscar Worthy
","I would like to cast my vote for best picture, best director and best actor. Sully. While it includes the details of the actual event in great detail the story mainly focuses on what transpired after the incredible water landing on the Hudson. This is a little known part of the story that was not reported on by the mass media. It reveals the post event ordeals that Sully and his co-pilot were put through. Tom Hanks portrayal of Sully is nothing short of amazing. One of his best performances that I've seen in years. I also happen to think that his overlooked performance in 'Bridge of Spy's' was nothing short of a travesty. The direction of Sully is suburb. Clint Eastwood blends the actual events, flashbacks into Sully's earlier days and the aftermath into a seamless heroic tale. I highly recommend this movie. The world is short on hero's these days. Sully is one heroic story.",9,2,4,16 September 2016
