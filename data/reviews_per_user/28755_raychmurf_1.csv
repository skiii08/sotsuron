The Avengers," Review of The Avengers
","OK, so I've been sat here for ages trying to write a review of the avengers that actually does the movie justice. Its so hard to say how amazing/brilliant/out of this world the movie actually was, as no words I can think of express how I thought about this film. There was not 1 point in the movie that I drifted off into la-la land my thoughts were more like 'i don't want this film to end'. I was a little uncertain of how all these mega movie stars were all going to fit into 1 movie, well a massive well done to Joss Whedon, if you don't get goosebumps every time one superhero meets another then you clearly have something wrong with you. Like I'm not even joking, go to the doctors or something. The effort that was put into that to make sure it was pulled off was, well, phenomenal. This was my biggest concern about the movie and I for one was not left disappointed. The back story of all the characters were impeccably placed, Whedon took the time needed to re-introduce you to each character which I guess for people who live under rocks it's perfect for, however I wasn't bored watching this, it needed to be in the movie to remind you of each hero's struggle and why they are the way they are. It made you fight with yourself to try and think who you loved the most (Thor).For me this is the best movie I have seen in a long time and is the best marvel movie I have seen (yes I'm saying it, agree or not), it has heaps of action, it has so much humor it will leave you belly laughing for ages, enough to miss what other characters are saying. No characters are overshadowed, the fight scenes are superb and Captain America still has all his charm and cheese. For me The Hulk stole the show, I was at comic con when the announcements for the avengers were made, Mark Ruffalo got so much stick and still has until this day, well to all you people that thought he couldn't pull it off and thought he was going to 'ruin' the movie, eat your own words, you will come out of this film knowing that him being in it has made it something extra special.",10,2,6,3 May 2012
