Howl's Moving Castle," Great way to spend two hours
","I always meant to see Spirited Away, but never got around to it, so I'm glad I got a chance to see this film, by the same director, in the cinema. Based on the book of the same title by Dianna Wynne Jones, ,cite>Howl's Moving Castle is an anime cartoon telling the story of Sophie, a young hat-maker who is cursed by the Witch of the Waste and turned into a ninety year old woman. The only way for her to break the curse is to help Howl and his fire demon Calcifer break the curse that they are suffering under.This film was wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of this style of animation, it is too similar too Pokemon, but it is really well done here. The strong point, for me, being the backgrounds, ships, planes etc, but not the characters.We never really know all that much about the war of the background, apart from the fact that it has something to do with a missing prince. But I prefer stories that don't feel the need to explain every single thing to you. This is very much worth watching, and although this is a dubbed version I never got the feeling that the voices were out of place.I haven't read the novel, so I can't comment on the translation from book to film, but I have read some by Wynne Jones and they are very readable.",9,1,2,24 October 2005
Corpse Bride," Stop-motion perfection
","Poor old Victor just can't get his through his wedding rehearsal, can't remember his lines, bumps into things, sets the bride's mother on fire. It is all enough to send anyone running for the woods. But Victor has fallen in love with his arranged bride-to-be and sets about practicing those vows. Only problem is that, in doing so, he manages to marry a dead woman; the Corpse Bride. And she has waited long enough for a husband, and so does not intend to let this one get away.I really enjoyed this film. Visually it really is stunning. The stop-motion figures look fantastic, the bride in particular. The songs I wasn't overly impressed with, but they did the job. What I did love was the Victorian attitude of Mrs (Lady?) Everglot, with her constant disapproval of her daughter and her impropriety. You know, like being able to talk without gasping as she isn't wearing a corset.The story is based on a Russian folktale, which in turn was based on anti-Semitic practice of waylaying Jewish wedding parties and murdering the bride.",8,0,1,24 October 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Chocolate-inspired fun
","With this film you constantly hear people comparing it to the previous film version starring Gene Wilder. Well not here, because although I think I've seen it at some stage, I don't really remember it all that well. So obviously it didn't make a great impression on me.For the few who don't know this is based on the book of the same title by Roald Dahl. The plot is centered on the chocolate factory of the title, its owner (Willy Wonka) and Charlie Bucket. Charlie, played by Freddie Highmore from Finding Neverland, comes from a family so poor that all they seem to eat is cabbage soup. His four grandparents share the one bed, and never leave it. Every year for his birthday Charlie gets a bar of chocolate, the only one he'll have all year. He always gets a bar of Wonka's chocolate and loves the stories his grandpa Joe tells about the factory, and its mysterious owner Willy Wonka.When a competition to allow five children to enter the factory is announced the chances are slim that Charlie will get a golden ticketNow my memory might be faulty here, but wasn't Charlie supposed to be English? So why did he find a dollar bill? Why does he use the term candy? But those are just minor quibbles. All in all I really enjoyed this film. Depp's Wonka is wonderfully weird and, well, just plain wacky. His disdain for the children is perfect for the film, as are the Oompa Loompa's crazy routines. Certain reviews have compared Depp's Wonka to Michael Jackson, but I have to say I don't see the similarities. Yes both are unnaturally white, but Wonka is not interested in the children at all, he doesn't care about them, all he cares about is chocolate and sweets and inventing.From the outset it is obvious that this is a Burton film, there are all those weird but great visuals, not to mention Depp's take on Willy Wonka. Although I did think that the music wasn't especially Burtonesque, and in most places didn't really stand out. Having said that I did enjoy the Oompa Loompa's songs.The children are all well-cast, Highmore especially is perfect as the scrawny underfed Charlie. But my favourite was the spoiled-rotten 'Veruca Salt, the little brute, Has just gone down the garbage chute'.",8,4,6,23 August 2005
Green Street Hooligans," Predictable, but somewhat entertaining
","Football has never really had a good film made about it, not that I've seen anyway. I mean most people enjoy that Christmas favourite Escape to Victory, but despite having Pele, the football isn't really that good. Is Green Street any better? Football-wise, I'd have to say yes. But this film isn't really about football at all. It is about the West Ham firm, the GSE (Green Street Elite), and football fans' violence and how this all appears to an outsider.That outsider is Matt, who we meet as he is being expelled from Harvard, of course for something he didn't do. Uncertain now of his future, he was studying journalism, he decides to go stay with his sister living in England. But when he arrives his brother-in-law(Steve) has a romantic night out planned, so Matt ends up heading down the pub with Steve's younger brother, and then out to a football match. And so he is introduced to the world of football, or soccer as he calls it. Pretty quickly he is swept away and becomes one of the lads, fighting along side them as they meet up with other footballing firms.So expect plenty of violence and fighting.But Pete Dunham and the GSE aren't really bad guys, at least not in this film. Pete is a teacher. He is a gentleman, giving up his seat to a woman on the tube. Isn't that nice of him.Overall the film itself seems to have been swayed by the violence. We do get a bit of a message that violence creates problems and leaves lives wrecked, but in the end, certain violence is endorsed as proper and correct. Throughout the film as Matt grows more and more into a fighter he is portrayed as growing in confidence, and in appeal as we see him giving his number to girls.Using innocent-faced Wood as Matt was a good choice. The rest of the cast also give good performances. Marc Warren I will be looking out for again, although hopefully he'll lose the overdone cockney slang and Mary Poppins-esquire accent (no, it wasn't that bad).But all in all the film is quite predictable, and nothing to write home about. It also takes the side of the GSE, and so lessons their violence, turning their actions into more of an acceptable form of violence as it is only against other firms, and not the general public.",7,0,0,8 October 2005
Pride & Prejudice," Oh so very boring
","Sometimes directors really make you think, make you stop and consider their work, make you want to never ever see anything in the cinema ever again because they have killed any desire you might have felt for moving pictures. Wright has almost managed to do this.I mean, how does one go about transforming Austen's Pride and Prejudice, a book full of wit and humour, into something so dreadfully boring? And I can't blame the dialogue, because a lot of it was lifted directly from the book. And I can't blame the actors because I've seen them do so much better in other works, and there is one scene in this film that hints at how good this film could have been. Who is left to blame? Well, the director who instead of giving us a romantic comedy instead decided to show off his camera skills.Ohh, look at the countryside. See the strange camera angle. And what was with the porcine fetish? Did I really need to get that close to a pig's testicles? The one good thing about this film, it was so terrible I was actually in fits of laughter in the middle of it. Never before has seeing some one walking, walking, walking through the misty countryside been so humorous. I'd swear I laughed for ten minutes. And I so wanted to just shout out 'How lame is this entire film' but I resisted out of courtesy, although I'm not quite sure if anyone who enjoyed this film deserves any respect at all.It may seem like I'm being a bit harsh on this film, but that is only because it deserves it. Knightly looked ridiculous in her costumes. All they did was emphasize how flat-chested she is (something that didn't crop up in Pirates), and made her look, well terrible. And speaking of terrible; Matthew McFadyen, what the hell happened to you? A man who was great as the taciturn, withdrawn character in Spooks, is here a pasty-grey faced twit.",1,42,85,7 October 2005
The Island," No-brainer but mildly entertaining
","This could have been a really interesting film, a proper sci-fi film that raises questions, that asks about society and what we believe in.Opening with Lincoln Six Echo on a boat, this film looks fantastic. Glossy, bright, cinematic and impressive, but everything that is good about this film is limited to the surface, but what else did I expect from a Michael Bay film? Lincoln Six Echo believes himself to be a survivor from some great contamination, where almost all of humanity was wiped out. The only purpose he and his fellow survivors have is to be chosen in the lottery and go to 'The Island'. But Lincoln is different than the others, he asks questions, he has strange dreams, and eventually he discovers the truth.He, and all the others in the lottery are clones. Products used to replace their sponsors organs if and when they are needed. Going to the island is really going to get harvested.I'm presuming you can guess what happens? He and Jordan Two Delta break-out and have a whole bunch of adventures in trying to escape the clutches of the evil Merrick and the mercenary-type team he has sent after them, headed by Laurant. Cue car chases, explosions, death, destruction, mayhem. You get the picture.A fun, no-brain film that'll entertain you while its on, but you wouldn't really be bothered if you never saw it again. The problem for me is that it had possibility. Merrick, the doctor who created the clones, sees them as product, as soulless, as not human. They live their lives as they are programmed to do, quite happily until their trip to the island. But Lincoln is different, so surely that was an opportunity to make Merrick question what he is doing, to question whether or not the clones are as non-human as he had though. Instead the film simply serves up a stock bad-guy, who's really only in it for the money. And of course his own god-complex.And lets not get started on the Laurant character who ends up being a good guy! I mean, are we supposed to think that simply because he helps Jordan and kills the baddies in the black tracksuits that that makes up for everything else? Sure he looks cool, but honestly...",5,1,1,17 August 2005
