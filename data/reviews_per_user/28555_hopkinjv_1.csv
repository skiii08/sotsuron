Requiem for a Dream," Terrific Film but not for everyone
","I could tell I was going to like this film from the get go. Now I must preamble that I am not very queezy and can usually watch any movie regardless of content, so the drug use didn't disturb me as much as it might a typical viewer. That being said, the credit sequence is very gripping and the movie wastes no time giving you a solid profile of all of the characters. I found myself immediately connecting to all of the characters in various ways, but particularly with Harry and his mom Sara's relationship. They both care for each other in a very real sense that isn't often portrayed accurately in films. Both Jared Leto (Harry) and Ellen Burstyn (Sara) turn in incredible performances that piece the film together well. Leto in particular impressed me after comparing this role with his other cult classic role from the same year, Paul Allen from American Psycho. Leto plays a very different character in this film and he makes himself almost unrecognizable as the drug addicted youth. I was also very impressed with Jennifer Connelly as usual but it was Marlon Wayans that really surprised me. I'm used to seeing him in comedic roles, and this was certainly the opposite, and he nailed it.The camera work in the film is superb often utilizing multiple cameras in one view. The editing was great particularly toward the end of the film. And the score. What can I say about the score that hasn't already been said. Haunting, mysterious, phenomenal. All in all the film was terrific although I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. Great story and even better characters. A must watch for cult classic lovers.",9,0,1,19 October 2011
