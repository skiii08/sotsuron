The Blair Witch Project," A remarkably well done film
","Let me say one thing before I begin.. this was an remarkably well done film.  Its reliance on acting skills and inventive story telling rather than the sordid showmanship of today's so called 'blockbusters' was a refreshing reminder that the moviemakers of today still have a soul.The Good Points: The acting was exceptional on all levels.  Completely engaging and believable, you must keep reminding yourself that this is just' a movie.  The production method was, in such few words, ingenious.  The use of a non-fixed script method and the filming with standard camcorder equipment led to a more believable atmosphere and gave the film a realistic feeling'.  It's ability to use your own imagination to create fear from something they do not even show you was simply amazing.  It is a true thinking' movie.The Bad Points: While I have few complaints about this movie, I can not conclude that it did not have its share of problems.  I did find the pace of the movie slow at parts, with scenes seeming to repeat their general point over and over.  The level of annoyance was a bit high at times, as the characters argued about camera usage for seemingly endless amounts of time. While this was credited by many as the `scariest movie of all time', I personally did not find that to be true at all. 
Thus the frightening' effect was lessened.  I found it hard to believe that someone would find themselves wanting to film under the circumstances presented in the story.  The amount of humor in this movie far outweighed the actual sense of fear that it induced in me.  But this is just my opinion. I noticed the level of pensive fear in most of the people around me during the movie, so be assured that not all feel this way.Even with all of the bad points I have stated, the seemingly small amount of good points presented far outweighs them. Overall, the film was excellent.  It is far from becoming one of my favorite' movies of all time, but I am sure other will definitely feel much more strongly about it.  Go see it! You will no regret that you did. or will you?",Null,1,1,29 July 1999
Mission: Impossible II," All action, no mission
","This was not a Mission Impossible movie. The script had few plot turns or unexpected surprises, unlike the first one which kept you guessing at every turn.  Most attempts at surprise consisted of the overused mask trick, which any half-witted audience member could see right through.  The love story was not needed (and weak at that) and the script focused mainly on Ethan. What happened to team work?  It was there, but at the same time not.  The action sequences on the other hand were some of the most impressive and beautiful scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie... true John Woo!  Then again MI is supposed to be suspense, not straight action.  The bottom line is this same movie could have come out under another title been a hundred times better. It was a good spy movie, a wonderful action movie, but not Mission Impossible.  Give the direction back to Brian De Palma, get a more intelligent script and let John Woo go crazy on another project. Until then, go see the first one again.The line that sums up the weak plot (quote may not be exact): (after Ethan explains what he believes Chimera and Bellerophon are)Luther:  'So you really think it could be that easy?'Ethan:  'Why not?'",Null,0,0,26 May 2000
