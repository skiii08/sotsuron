The Avengers," The Avengers Delivers On All Counts
","With each subtle hint at a future collaborative effort of various Marvel superheroes, it seems now that the entire world's anticipation was growing to an immense level. Now that The Avengers has shattered various box office records and is on pace to top the $1 billion worldwide gross mark, I'm sure anyone bothering to write up a review is doing so simply to state his or her case for how they enjoyed it, not so much to tell others what to expect.As far as that goes, I was incredibly impressed with The Avengers. My initial expectation of an action-packed, SFX-laced adrenaline rush were met with ease, and nothing less would have been satisfactory for any decent superhero picture. I also expected a movie with a hefty dose of comedic relief, mainly because of Robert Downey's lighthearted take on Iron Man in both of his solo pictures. This also turned out to be true, and added just what the film needed in between extremely heavy scenes of fast-paced, chaotic action.One of the strong dividing lines throughout recent years has been the casting choices for the various superheroes that have gotten both their own pictures and inclusion in the Avenger initiative. Going all the way back to the newer incarnations of the Hulk, fans were unable to come to any semblance of a conclusion on who would be best for what and why. 'Why Chris Evans as Captain America?' is a commonly heard question, as is 'Why didn't Edward Norton come back as The Hulk?'. Unfortunately, you cannot please everyone with so many pivotal casting decisions, but I tend to feel that, overall, the characters portrayed in The Avengers are properly matched up to capable actors. Mark Ruffalo does an excellent job as the mild-mannered Bruce Banner, Jeremy Renner and Scarlet Johansson are easily up to their respective characters Hawkeye and Black Widow. The rest of the team has experience in their roles, from Downey's Iron Man and Evans' Captain America to Chris Hemsworth's Thor and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. But, when combined on screen, you cannot tell the 'rookies' from the veterans.Simply put, The Avengers is the best Superhero movie you're likely to come across in terms of sheer entertainment. While I personally wouldn't rank it as my favorite (a reservation I still hold for Watchmen), it's without a doubt worth the price of admission and the incredible amount of hype it's received. An incredible feat of film production and merging talents, The Avengers is destined to be remembered as a high-water mark in superhero cinema.",9,3,8,17 May 2012
Iron Man 3," It Disappoints...And Doesn't Disappoint.
","After two iterations of the series and the Avengers collective effort, most of us who have paid attention thus far more or less knew what to expect from Iron Man 3. Namely, outstanding special effects coupled with heavy doses of Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic one-liners and playful interactions with his supporting cast. Here, Iron Man 3 does not disappoint. However, after so many examples of Tony Stark and his exploits to draw from, this particular batch seems stale in comparison.I cannot find fault in the plot, despite my lack of comic-book knowledge and the incredible amount of animosity that crowd has towards the inconsistencies and utter lack of translation taking place between particular characters and events. Things unfold at a rapid pace, and even though you have a good feeling regarding how things will all turn out favoring Stark, there are moments where the film remembers (as the original Iron Man did) to remind the audience of his humanity. The standard cast of supporting actors returns, but Ben Kingsley adds some truly unexpected...things...to the film. No spoilers here, I assure you, but his presence is appreciated by this viewer.So, what's to blame for the disappointment? Simple comparison, of course, and its unavoidable after four films based solely (or largely) on Stark/Iron Man. It entertains, but it also leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The closing line of the credits, 'Tony Stark Will Return', is about a 50/50 proposition; we all know the Avengers 2 is coming, but Iron Man 4? Something tells me this is as far as they can (or should) take the series. Something also tells me they won't stop, and continuing to cast the light on Iron Man may end up making the entire franchise (which has been mostly stellar, in my opinion) poorer for it.",6,0,2,26 September 2013
World War Z," Deviation Aside, Enjoyable Thrills
","Your enjoyment of World War Z doesn't hinge solely on your enjoyment of the book which it claims to be based on, but owes it to anyone who has read the book to disclaim 'loosely based'. That being said, if you've read the book beforehand, the trailers alone should let you know that the film is going in wholly different direction that Max Brooks laid out in his novel.I am a huge fan of the zombie franchise, which George Romero essentially put a patent on and dozens of films have branched off from over the years. What 'World War Z' does is attempt to mesh the behavioral patterns of the '28 Days Later' infected undead (I refuse to call them zombies, zombies are the slow, shuffling Romero staple) with the essential ideas behind Brooks' book. It does this admirably, but it's a direction that ultimately didn't need to be taken in order to make the film successful. In my mind, it felt like a lazy way of telling a story that builds itself up, cutting time off of the reel in favor of a more fast-paced, energized film experience.Being a huge fan of the book, I refused to shell out the $10 to see it in the theaters; as I said, the trailers told me clearly that the film was going to diverge far enough from the book for me to lower my expectations. As a rental, and for what it is, it's nowhere near terrible. Remove all comparisons to the book it takes minor inspirations from, and Brad Pitt does a solid job of weaving his way through a decently scripted and constructed horror film.This ended up being Pitt's highest grossing film to date, and a combination of factors play into that, not least of which being a rather stale list of opposing options in theaters at the time of its release. Still, it's an enjoyable film, however far it deviates from the source material, and however ridiculous some of us may think calling something that runs a zombie. Could have been better...and could have been a whole lot worse.",6,0,0,19 September 2013
Oblivion," Overcasted, Underfed, Average
","Tom Cruise is a mercurial actor when you dig into his body of work, and his role in Oblivion almost seems custom-built for somebody else. The story itself is incredibly thin, but all the pieces fall together in proper sequence, and in the end, you're not left surprised so much as satisfied that things play out the way they do.For much of the early portion of the film, the overall mystery factor leaves you curious, but once they strip this away, the film does a poor job of evaluating the antagonist and its motives. Much like Cruise's role, that of Morgan Freeman could have been filled by a much lesser actor with similar results; there is simply not enough room for him to deftly navigate the film in the manner he is capable. Minor parts aside, the casting is not so much a flaw for Oblivion as it is a point of confusion; such big names need not have applied.The plot itself, as I mentioned, is thin on detail and heavy on putting things in their right place. Sci-fi goes in either one direction or the other most of the time, and as a huge fan of the genre in a film sense, Oblivion doesn't have the balance between style, substance and storytelling to truly grip me. The big revealing moments are not so much expected as they are dry, leaving a taste in mouth that is familiar, but one which you cannot quite place where you've experienced it before. A strange sort of deja vu.A few minor tweaks, and a story that didn't pat itself on the back for being sequenced properly and went further into the details of the intriguing world it only dabbles in, could have made Oblivion much more than what it is; an average film, overcasted and underfed.",5,0,5,19 September 2013
Silver Linings Playbook," Solid.
","To some degree, relating to the situations and conditions of the main characters in Silver Linings Playbook may increase your overall enjoyment of the film. This is a heading that anyone should acknowledge before pressing play.With that out of the way, what this film is, at its heart, is a romantic comedy that does certain things well and others poorly. The on-screen chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, whose relationship is a focal point of the film, is jagged at best; and this is to the film's benefit, as you watch their interactions unfold. The father-son relationship between Cooper and Robert DeNiro is almost completely unbelievable, and if this film has any sour sticking point, this is it. DeNiro's casting seems almost purely for name power, as if the filmmakers weren't confident enough in Cooper And Lawrence being attractive draws (which they undoubtedly are, Cooper perhaps more so now than DeNiro has been in years).With the volatile relationship between Cooper and Lawrence, a great many of situations develop, some predictable, some not, but they all are arranged and constructed appropriately to tell a tale of adversity, perseverance, and the crazy moments in between. At times it feels forced, at others confused, but for many American families, this is life. I can relate, and I refer back to my opening paragraph as a reminder that so much of this film can either hit you in the heart or fly over your head depending on who you are. This is true of most art, but Silver Linings Playbook is a bit more focused, almost but not quite a 'niche' film.Overall, a great film, but anything resembling universal appeal is lost due to the subject matter and some unwarranted casting choices. But for those of us who can relate, to some degree, I do believe you'll feel the same as me; well worth the 2 hours.P.S. - I've noticed more than a few reviews of this film that claim the movie doesn't accurately portray mental illness, and that it makes light of a serious issue. You cannot, in any way, blame the film for this; it is a story, to be enjoyed or not, not a documentary on the mental disorders of the main characters. Keep that in mind.",8,1,3,12 August 2013
Now You See Me," Why? No Reason.
","It frankly doesn't surprise me that this film has received more positive than negative feedback; it gives an audience almost everything the trailers and cast lead them to believe they'll get. Plenty of twists, turns, face time with noteworthy actors and a story that doesn't force you to believe in magic in order to believe what's happening on screen. All that being said, there is a minority of viewers, myself included, who know they could have done much more with all the talent and potential lying within Now You See Me...or maybe they couldn't, and shouldn't have bothered to try.I'm hesitant to say the movie is bad, because deep down it truly isn't. Everyone, from Woody Harrelson to Michael Caine and every name-drop in between does their job and fits in snug with what's going on. Somewhere between the intriguing first 20 minutes and the disappointing last hour or so, I kept asking myself, 'why am I not enjoying this?' The answer? It could have been so much more.Hasty references to the 'why' of it all do nothing to satisfy the curiosity of the curious, and when the final credits rolled, I realized that this was the point all along. Even after the major reveal takes place and you finally understand the 'how', the 'why' never materializes. The introduction of the film makes that question the focal point, and the rest of the film does its best to make you forget you ever had the question in your head to begin with.Again, I can understand the praise, but I felt as if left the theater having been cheated out of my money. Considering a couple of the main scenes in the film, perhaps this was the filmmakers' entire goal to begin with. It wouldn't surprise me in the least. Regardless, most people seemed to enjoy it, so there's no reason to bash it any further than by saying it simply wasn't what I wanted it to be. It happens sometimes.",4,10,16,26 September 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Wes Anderson Presents: Another Acquired Taste
","You honestly have to view the breadth of Anderson's work to understand 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. It feels very much like a relatively over-the-top climax of every bit of the man's artistic desires. As if every last thing he wanted fell into place, alongside the pertinent inspiration and a willing audience. An acquired audience.Many will watch this film and, sooner or later, wonder why they're watching it. These people are not the target audience. Others, in turn, will watch the film and understand within the first ten minutes exactly why they're watching it, and will observe with keen interest Anderson's grand vision of the Grand Budapest and the many overtly and/or subtly intriguing characters surrounding it.For my money, 'The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou' remains Anderson's finest moment, but I cannot take away from the merits of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. Ralph Fiennes is, in quality and quantity, the featured actor of the film, and does an outstanding job as the excessively eccentric M. Gustave. His constant companion is a young lobby boy, Zero, played with a quiet, reserved charm by Tony Revolori. The cast is rounded out by many big names, each with parts of varying significance and, despite the overall positive results, varying intrigue. I personally regret the brief time we get to spend with Bill Murray, Tom Wilkinson, Jude Law and Harvey Keitel. While most of the cast fits into their roles nicely, the occasional head-scratcher remains. Murray's role is perhaps the most obvious.So, the acting is excellent. Working with Anderson's vision, everything merges together smoothly. The cinematography, a long-standing hallmark of Anderson's films, is breathtaking, truly the heart and soul of the film. The plot is flimsy, but that is ultimately the center of the acquired taste; if you can overlook a flimsy plot to appreciate the other two-thirds of film foundation (acting, atmosphere), then you'll have no problem enjoying the Budapest.It doesn't surprise me that this movie has received so much praise. It also doesn't surprise me that it's received so much indifference, displeasure and/or disgust. As usual, Wes Anderson remains far enough outside the widest reaching circles of film making to inherently create a 'love/hate' offer to viewers with each successive film. While not all of his work has been loved by myself, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' certainly is.",8,4,7,20 October 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Accomplished.
","Anyone having seen prior installments of Tom Cruise's 'Mission Impossible' series would have simple expectations for 'Ghost Protocol'. Despite the redundancy of both the 2nd and 3rd installments, all of the films, in varying degrees, have managed to satisfy my desire for smart action and minimal interruption. After renting 'Ghost Protocol' via my cable provider, my only regret is not having paid the extra $5 to see it on the big screen.There are few surprises, which ultimately is a good thing; nobody really wants a proved formula to be messed with too much, no matter what they say. That's not to say that specific formulas are immune to the dregs of repetitive redundancy, of course. This film's saving grace is undoubtedly the amount of time that came between it and the last installment in the series.The film itself builds in predictable fashion, into a rather 'safe' plot line. In it, an evil man with an evil henchman attempt to bring about the end of the world in typical fashion (nuclear devastation), and the only people who can do anything about it are Ethan Hawk (Cruise) and his unlikely but strong supporting cast. A cast that brings a dose of comedy relief and bumbling technical prowess (Simon Pegg), a capable woman who's as gorgeous as she is dangerous (Paula Patton) and a mysterious, unproven asset (Jeremy Renner) who is thrown into the mix rather abruptly, to say the least. The casting was well done, as those who spend the most time on screen command the camera and show both their ability to manage both action and the occasional dose of suspense-building narrative.'Ghost Protocol' rarely lets up, letting the viewer catch his breath in predictable spots as the film unfolds in a manner that leaves you expecting twists and turns and getting them, just perhaps not in the order and/or fashion you thought you saw coming. This combination of fast-paced intensity and subtle, but satisfying reveals and climaxes are the meat and potatoes of Cruise's impossible missions, and not since the original has one of them hit the mark like 'Ghost Protocol'. As long as you're not expecting more than the previous installments offered, you won't be disappointed with this mission.",7,1,3,17 May 2012
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A Comedic Classic...To Some Of Us
","You get it, or you don't, or you do and just don't relate anyway. Whatever the case may be, this sort of random, senseless comedy is a sub genre of comedic films that is just as often praised as it is ridiculed.I find myself praising it more often than not, and particularly so when Will Ferrell is involved. The man is, quite simply, as adept at this style of comedy as anyone ever has been, and his strong and silly performance, alongside a terrific supporting cast, have made Anchorman a classic in my mind. It has provided me and my friends more quotable lines and good times than any other Ferrell flick, and we typically enjoy them all. The upcoming sequel seems to me, at least, to be Ferrell's way of doing justice to what he believes to be his finest film.Just as important to making the film work is the rest of the Channel 5 News Team. Brick, Champ and Brian are pivotal in playing off of each other, taking advantage of somewhat predictable quirks and eccentricities with skill. Paul Rudd quickly became a comedy/dramatic comedy staple at the box office, and his work here, alongside Steve Carrell's slow-but-sweet portrayal of weatherman Brick Tamlan and the underrated Champ Kind (played by the also underrated David Koechner) round out the film, give it an identity with memorable characters and classic scenes.The rest of the cast is stand-up as well, including Alicia Silverstone, who holds up strong as Ferrell's counterpart and vying anchorwoman Veronica Corningstone. It all comes together quite nicely cast-wise, and the writing..well, the writing is the best you're going to find in a quote/unquote 'silly' comedy, where the story is just a foundation for the ridiculousness to flow off of.Honestly, I can understand the strong disagreement when I say so, but in my mind, Anchorman is without a doubt one of the finest comedic films ever created. It is, much like Mr. Burgundy himself, the balls",9,0,0,16 August 2013
The Shawshank Redemption," A Shining Piece Of Cinematic Excellence
","This movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me, I didn't come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have always been a movie buff and, aside from that, a big fan of the writings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film, which I was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. Afterwards, I had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema.First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale, in screenplay form, is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in, and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice (as our main character is judged by his peers) to the dawning realization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for it's masses of convicted felons. It all flows fabulously, as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. It's this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemption's impact.Second, but just as vital, was the casting. Tim Robbins has always been, in my mind, a criminally underrated acting talent. He always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength, and in that conflict one always questions his motivation, his reason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the character of Andy Dufrense, who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. Indeed, it's safe to say that, mentally at least, Andy spent very little time in that prison.Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that, I think, no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of Shawshank, he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to Freeman's on-stage abilities. As a 'man who can get things', Red is instrumental in many inmates' lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples (cigarettes, petty cash), Red is as important a character as Andy in terms of the film's overall message of hope despite hopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job.The excellent acting doesn't end there. Bob Gunton, who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types, portrays the warden of Shawshank as a sinister, scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the Bible and an arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude. William Sadler is another outstanding character actor, similar to Gunton, whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood. One of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden, Guard Officer Hadley, who was portrayed by Clancy Brown, well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense, hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesn't exist.Beyond the writing and the acting, this movie was perfect in every other aspect. I've seen it many times over the years, often turning to it, perhaps subconsciously, during particularly rough or depressing patches. I've very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations, but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of it's impact or relativity nearly 20 years later.",10,1,1,4 April 2012
The Silence of the Lambs," Are The Lambs Still Crying?
","This is one of those films that sticks with you. The psychological horror of Anthony Hopkin's Hannibal Lecter is like a thick fog that remains in your head, sticking to the corners of your subconscious in a way too few villains have ever managed. It's one of those career-defining roles that, having seen someone so naturally take it on, you cannot imagine anyone else stepping into. Having read Thomas Harris' fantastic novel beforehand, this was one of the biggest selling points to me. As anyone who has read the book(s) can tell you, Hannibal Lecter is an extremely deep and complicated character that demanded an actor capable of both sophisticated mannerisms and a terrible underlying nature of pure evil. The moment Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling meets Hopkins' Lecter, you can see it all in the intense gleam of his eyes.As a best picture winner, this film was righteously recognized for it's strong merits of precise storytelling, incredible lead acting from Hopkins and Foster and a strong supporting cast, and most of all for truly engaging the viewer in it's atmosphere of horror. The little touches round out the fantastic experience, from Lecter's disturbing facial appliance to Clarice's slow unveiling of her troubled past and Lecter's bizarre way of showing his empathy and affection, all the way to Ted Levine's superb portray of the psychologically disturbed Buffalo Bill.A movie that still gets under your skin all these years later, it's a crime if you haven't seen it. A brilliant film from beginning to end is rare enough, but when it also features a character who was destined to be one of horror's iconic faces, it becomes a legend in the making.",9,1,1,17 May 2012
The Hangover Part III," Did We Need Part III? Yes. Did We Need This Plot? No.
","There's just no way around it: The Hangover could have used a third (and final, hopefully) installment, but this is NOT good enough, in any way, shape or form, to match up to the excellent original and solid sequel.The main issue is the plot, which feels as hashed together as I can imagine the entire film was. The performances of the main characters are still as solid as they've ever been, but Bradley Cooper has come a long way in between Hangovers and his presence is almost...overbearing? It's hard to pinpoint, but none of the actors (including a more involved Ken Jeong as Chow and a unnecessarily involved John Goodman as the film's antagonist) are helped by the thin and void story.Without spoiling it, I'll just say that the plot itself chokes the humor out of the film. Each of the previous Hangovers worked by creating situations that were, in and of themselves, hilarious, and then adding the reactions of a handful of excellent comedic actors. A bit of improv must have come into play as well, and even that feels cut off for most of Part III. The potential danger that created the tension in the first two films is diluted to the point where it doesn't work how it's supposed to work: as a platform for the humor. Nothing is better than a good laugh when you might be expecting things to go wrong...and even when they go wrong in Part III, you can't seem to find it in you to care as you once did.In the end, you'll most likely wonder, like myself, why any of this had to happen in the first place. I'm not talking about the film, but the story within, which is absolutely ridiculous to begin with and gets no better as it continues to unfold. There are some truly funny moments...with such an impressive cast, it was an impossibility to completely avoid that. But these are too far between a shoddy script to justify itself. A poor idea laced into a great overall idea (concluding the series with a bang) makes the entire thing...below itself as a franchise installment.",4,1,2,9 November 2013
Born on the Fourth of July," Redemption As Gritty As The Path Behind It
","To preface my review, I'll say that I am still amazed that I didn't see this film sooner than today. How it escaped even an accidental viewing is, especially considering my thoughts on it in retrospect and my love of war-based cinema, is baffling.What might color the modern viewer who has yet to experience Born, as it did me, was the idea of Tom Cruise portraying a role more down to earth and realistic than we're used to seeing from the actor. Consider also that in 1989 he was just hitting his stride as a cinematic centerpiece along with the blunt force trauma he had to portray as real-life Vietnam veteran Ron Kovac, and the modern viewer is almost assured of having reservations. Watching some of the special features of my copy of the DVD makes me realize that even then, there were reservations about Cruise. At least outside of Oliver Stone and Ron Kovac, who were sold early on.It takes maybe half the film until you start to understand it, but Cruise does sell it, and he sells with more honest integrity than I think he's put into any role in his career. It doesn't surprise me as much considering the room and avenues of expression Oliver Stone has traditionally given to his actors, but it does further cement Cruise as an actor of quality more so than quantity.The film itself, and all of its particulars, offer sharp contrasts, bare humanity and the horrors we're capable of, and the eventual redemption of a man who I do believe, regardless of our own lives, anyone can relate to on some level. It is a story told many times, but this perspective, unique as all perspectives inherently are, is as vital to the entire story of the Vietnam War and ultimately of defining ourselves as any I've ever considered.Whether or not Stone embellishes is not for me to say; I have yet (and I stress 'yet', as I do believe this film will lead me to reading the book Kovac wrote) to explore the particulars. But, in the end, it doesn't matter; the overall message is as clear as can be by the end. This is the story of a young man who believed and who was deceived, only to once again believe. Each step is fittingly littered with personal conflicts and triumphs, intimate encounters with people from various walks of life. It emphasizes the point that our own beliefs, our own deceptions, our own lives are the product of influence. What we perceive from our families, our friends, our media, inevitably colors our choices in life. For Kovac, these choices led to a swirling chaos of negative consequences. These negative consequences ultimately lead to the redeeming aspects of his later life, but the truth is always there, and it's an ugly truth. A haunting truth, brought to life by haunting moments.What keeps me from considering this film as more than very good is an inherent disconnect of generations. While my generation will perhaps look back on our current conflicts in the Middle East the same way the Vietnam generation looks at their own conflicts and struggles, Oliver Stone was and, with Born, is a part of a generation that I am not. His perspective is not hard to relate to, but it is hard to understand.Beyond that, the film has a handful of small issues that feel more like nitpicking but can't be avoided. The cinematography, while advanced for its time, doesn't lend itself as much to intimacy as it does to the swirl of conflict surrounding Kovac and America. The viewer often feels so swept up in the background that it can be difficult to spot and hone in on the essential point of specific scenes. Also, while I applaud Cruise's efforts in his role, he and several other actors are still either miscast or underutilized in my estimation. The storytelling of Oliver Stone, while easy to digest once the film is finished, is choppy and inconsistent, and I felt that certain moments were not given the emphasis they deserved in the overall story of Ron Kovac.Despite the small flaws, I can't imagine nor have I witnessed a better overall portrayal of a war-torn life and the dirt, grime, pain and suffering that must be carried throughout such a life than this film offers. The gritty realism holds up even today, a time where we can often find more harrowing images on our local news than in this film. There is no individual scene or moment that defines Born On The Fourth Of July; it is a journey that resonates most strongly at its bittersweet conclusion.",8,1,8,5 November 2014
