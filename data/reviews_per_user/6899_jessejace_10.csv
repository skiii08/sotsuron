Requiem for a Dream," Misunderstood
","It's a shame how many people mislabel this as a 'drug movie' (or an 'anti-drug movie'). It's not about drugs. It's about addiction in all its forms. If it seems heavy-handed, it's because it doesn't waste time dabbling in the extras. This movie does what it's supposed to do with a high rate of efficiency.Few other films simultaneously reach such extremes of beauty and brutality as Requiem does. Watching it will wipe you out for a while, but you'll be back for more in time. My main gripe is Clint Mansell's music score, which sounds more like it should be played on a $20 Casio than by the Chronos Quartet (and which, inexplicably, has become 'one of those soundtracks' that finds its way into trailers for other movies ALL THE TIME).",8,0,1,6 January 2008
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," what did i expect?
","First of all, I would have been a fool to expect anything more than crap from this movie, but I watched it anyway...because that's what good boyfriends do. But unlike some of the romance comedy tripe I've been exposed to, this one failed at every possible opportunity to redeem itself from total crapdom.First of all, how am I supposed to believe that Kate Hudson's character is really interested in political journalism AND enviromental issues AND this AND that AND the other stuff she claims to want to write about in the movie? Here's a bright, young journalist who has already made the worst career move in her lifetime by joining the staff of a dippy women's magazine, whose subject matter doesn't interest her in the least.  Ooops. THEN, she comes up with this great idea to do research on relationships by doing 'all the classic things that girls do wrong.'  Well, I've never been in a relationship where the woman was even close to being as psycho as Kate Hudson acts throughout the film...but maybe that's because I'm still young. Apparently 'all the classic things' includes buying an ugly dog, giving her boyfriend's member a female name (?!) and otherwise being a complete socio- Nazi.  Classic, dude. The film culminates in a god-awful karaoke battle (which is actually one of the good parts), but dang, it wouldn't be a date movie if the couple didn't have a fight, go home, get all sad, suddenly decide they love each other and then start making out while some crappy song swells (to make certain that the audience can identify this scene as emotionally important, you see). My friends, this is why divorces happen.",Null,1,2,21 March 2004
Fargo," miscategorized but good
","This movie is often miscategorized in video rental stores as 'mystery' or'suspense.'  It's really neither, so many people I talk to who didn't like the movie have that attitude because they expected more intrigue and complexity from it. There's not much to this movie, but it's still good.William H. Macy's character makes the viewer wince again and again at hispoor judgement and its consequences.  He's a really lamentable figure, andprobably tied for best character in the film with that of Frances McDormand, who uses sensibility and 'Minnesota nice' to bring justice to the guilty.Of course, the whole Scandinavian accent thing is really overdone in this film, but to good effect.  It lends a level of absurdity to every character who uses those mannerisms...a level of absurdity that's present in most real people, even though they try to mask it.",Null,0,0,26 May 2003
Van Helsing," play castlevania instead
","The first scene is a campy black-and-white scene involving Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein. I was so confused by this scene; at first I thought it was going to be some kind of movie-within-movie or frame story or something. At the very least, I expected a reveal that would bring reason to the campy acting and unlikely character relationships. It HAD to be intentional. Didn't it?Apparently not. The next thing I saw was a dead-serious title card reading 'ONE YEAR LATER.' From that moment, I knew it was going to be a long couple of hours.Sure enough, this movie is packed shoulder to shoulder, start to finish with actors who, for whatever reason, aren't acting. You've got Hugh Jackman over here, making wry comments and being oh, so clever. You've got this horrendously unmenacing Dracula and his community theater reject wives (who spend more than fifty percent of their on screen time as computer-generated harpies without nipples). You've got dudes transforming from naked werewolves into humans with pants.The design Van Helsing's character is not bad, but it's a little too close to Vampire Hunter D. The film has but two saving graces, and those are Frankenstein's Monster and....hmmm. Sorry, the film has only one saving grace. And in this particular case, he failed to completely save the movie, so for all we know, the movie has NO saving graces. So reading this paragraph has just been a waste of your time.The idea of a story that binds Dracula, Igor, Frankenstein's Monster and werewolves is appealing, to be sure. That's why there have been so many video games made on that premise. But we shouldn't judge movies and games by the same standards, and anyone who does needs to be kicked in the face. If they were trying to make Castlevania into a movie, they should have just called it Castlevania: The Movie.",3,3,6,14 February 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," better than i expected, at least
","I went into this movie with a negative attitude, because I didn't like the first Matrix movie.  But I have to admit, I liked this one a little more.  It had more scenes that prompted my jaw to drop (and my jaw doesn't usually drop unless there's a sandwich in front of it).The fight scenes were excellent.  I was glad to see less gunfighting and more fisticuffs.  (What's the use of a gun, if everyone can dodge bullets? That's what really annoyed me about the Matrix.)  Guns are dumb.Monica Bellucci is mind-bendingly knockerific.  She should be in every movie.At the beginning of the movie there is a dorky rave sequence.  During that scene, I was thinking, 'what movie is this?'  It didn't seem to belong. Luckily, however, everyone at the rave is totally hot, so it doesn't matter.Trinity and Morpheus are still unlikeable in my opinion, and if you go to this movie expecting Keanu Reeves to impress you with his acting, well....then I'm sorry.  Furthermore, the script is just about as bad as the first movie's was, loaded with intentionally vague lines like, 'They will find you.  The answer is out there, and it is looking for you.  Follow the white rabbit.  Visit the oracle.  Eat some ham.'  So all you have to do is plug your ears when Neo or Morpheus have any lines, and you'll be fine.",Null,0,0,24 May 2003
The Terminal," not what i expected, but then again, what is?
","Spielberg has made so many 'oh my god that was so powerful and believable and IMPORTANT' movies, that now he can't make a whimsical bit of fluff without people saying, 'Oh my god, that was so unpowerful and inconceivable and TRIVIAL.' This movie feels like Catch Me If You Can, and requires a similar amount of suspension of disbelief in order to be enjoyed. Tom Hanks plays a foreign guy who learns to speak English in record time by reading a travel pamphlet. He falls for Catherine Zeta Jones, who is still beautiful as ever, even when playing a stupid, despicable flight attendant.But watch out for the 'evil' airport director! I say airport director, but he should have been referred to throughout the movie as the 'final boss,' because he seemed more like King Koopa or Sephiroth than a person existing in real life. How do you seriously explain his petty vengeance against Tom Hanks' character? That was the main issue that stuck with me throughout the film. The Evil Airport Director's role as fascist overlord of JFK Airport just didn't jive.There is also an important plot point near the end that made no sense to me whatsoever. It involves the final trumping of the Evil Overlord via an Indian janitor whose catchphrase, 'DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?' failed to make the Japanese audience at the theater where I watched Terminal laugh even once. I won't give it away, just watch the movie and then send me an email explaining what the hell happened, because I don't get it.This is not an important movie. It has no massive revelations or cathartic outpourings of wisdom (although it comes close, in a scene where Evil Final Boss asks Tom Hanks why he wants to enter the US. I half expected Tom to slap himself on the forehead and say, 'You're right! Why indeed!' and get on a plane to some country where foreigners DON'T get treated like garbage). But I won't rush to condemn Spielberg for taking a lighthearted prance down Fluffy Fluff Lane for the sake of box office numbers. Spielberg is only human, and he needs his five houses and twelve cars, just like the rest of us.",7,11,22,24 December 2004
Mr. Holland's Opus," This movie makes me want to barf
","This is one of my least favorite movies ever: a movie geared towards people who don't really know anything about music, and as such, reveals its complete stupidity to those who do. Mr. Holland's Crappy Opus is the story of Mr. Holland, a cranky guy who's not a very good teacher, not a very good musician, not a very good husband and not a very good father. To put it mildly, he has no redeeming qualities.He works for his whole life on this 'OPUS,' and when it finally gets performed, it's god- awful. It sounds like he wrote the soundtrack to a lame movie (except the people who really do write movie scores don't spend a whole lifetime on one film). How can you work on music composition your whole life, and still have no talent for it? Is it possible? Well, in the movies, anything's possible.The movie seems to credit Mr. Holland with inventing the pep band, which makes him all the more despicable to me. When the pep band at my high school started playing 'Louie, Louie,' the kids at the game didn't cheer. They would roll their eyes, and/or vomit. No movie can make me believe that being in a marching band is cool. Drumline, this means you. I was in the marching band from 6th grade until high school graduation, and it was decidedly not cool.There's also the pointless Rowena Subplot, which culminates in a gripping scene where Richard Dreyfuss's wife reads Rowena's name on a program, discovers that Rowena is not just a celtic mythology figure that her dorky husband is in love with and consequently makes a face. You'll be glued to your seat as a spectrum of emotions from stern disapproval to disapproving sternness passes through Mrs. Holland's face, and then the Rowena subplot proceeds to go precisely NOWHERE.Mr. Holland 'touches the lives' of all these students...and each life he touches is destroyed! He tells the redheaded girl to play the sunset; she becomes a miserable politician. He gives Rowena 'voice coaching' (is that what the kids are calling it now?); she runs away, never to be seen again. He hits that football player kid on the head with a bass drum beater to teach him about rhythm. (Yes. The only black guy in the movie has to learn about rhythm from a white guy.) And that kid dies! The film's solitary saving grace is the fact that it introduced Alicia Witt who, after appearing in Mr. Holland's Stupid, Life-Sucking Opus, went on to become the cutest redhead I have ever seen. She can play my sunset any day. Or something.But what's up with that scene where the hearing-impaired people 'appreciate' music by watching idiotic flashing lights? Nice going, Mr. Jackass, you've just implied that deaf people are morons. Let's wait and see whether they thank you for touching THEIR lives, dickweed. I actually found myself rooting for William H. 'This Is My Deal Here' Macy, the school's evil, conservative, buzzcut-sporting budget Nazi. 'Go, Mr. Macy. Cut his budget! Cut it DOWN! The school needs three new football stadiums, not creative arts education! Burn those violins on the baseball diamond!' So, if you like movies that are just ill-conceived vehicles for 60s pop rock montages (blah blah blah, fake moon landing footage, blah blah blah, Martin Luther King Jr, blah blah blah) and scene after scene of Richard Dreyfuss being a jerk, run out and see Mr. Dickweed's Heinously Barfalactic Opus.",1,15,39,9 April 2009
X2: X-Men United," babysteps towards greatness
","Better than the first X-Men, but still nothing to make you wet your pants with rapture.  I was happy to see the elimination of Toad and Sabretooth, and a slight development of Mystique.  The opening scene is rockin, too.Wolverine is uncharacteristically bloodthirsty in this movie.  In the comics he used to just punch through walls and hold his claws to people's necks a lot.Now he's Mr. Stabby McKillKill!  What gives?Cyclops needs to get headbutted.  I used to like Cyclops, but the first X-Men movie made him lose points with me...and now I really can't stand him. He gives bespectacled people everywhere a bad name, what with all his whining and crying and carrying on.If the TV spots for this movie hadn't flashed Lady Deathstrike's name on the screen, I might not have known who she was.  Next time they want to put a hot Asian woman in an X-Men movie, it ought to be Psylocke.  She's mind- bendingly knockerific (see also, The Matrix Reloaded and Traffic).When Wolvie says that Mystique is 'good,' and Magneto says, 'You have no idea,' I feel like puking.",Null,0,1,24 May 2003
The Matrix," perhaps the most overrated movie ever
","This movie has one of the worst scripts ever written.  It's got all this vague fluff that doesn't mean anything ('Neo, you must seek the answer.  The answer will find you.  The truth is out there.  Blah blah blah.  I know kung fu.'), and then they throw in a cheesy one-liner, for the trailers.  When Joey Pants says 'fasten your seatbelt because Kansas is going bye-bye,' I want to crush his head while screaming.Carrie Ann Moss is not cool...but this movie tries relentlessly to pass her off as cool.  Laurence Fishburne isn't cool either...but it's not his fault. He's still recovering from that stint as Cowboy Curtis on PeeWee's Playhouse.It's obvious the Wachowski Bros. watched a lot of anime, and this movie wants to be anime, but can't.  The kind of stuff this movie attempts is better left to comics and animation.  I am not impressed by computer-generated imagery and poorly executed wirework.",Null,0,1,24 May 2003
Donnie Darko," better each time i see it
","The first time I saw Donnie Darko, I was unsure of what I should have 'gotten' out of the film.  That uncertainty prompted me to watch the movie three moretimes, in order to understand it better.  In a world where so many movies take the viewer by the hand and coerce them into an uninspired emotional payoff, it was quite refreshing to finish watching Donnie Darko and have no ideawhatsoever about how I should feel.The story combines so many good elements, you can't help but find somethingentertaining about it.  There are the simple pleasures of 80s nostalgia, Kevin Smith-ish discussion about the Smurfs, and some really well-delivered comicmoments.  Then you have the darker, more thought provoking stuff about timetravel, alternate realities and destiny.  I might go so far as to say, this movie has everything.The film's end is one that reminds me of high school, when my English classwould debate the intended meanings of various symbols in literature.  I'm not sure what the writer intended, but Donnie Darko can definitely be interpreted in multiple ways.  As a matter of fact, I'm interpreting it in multiple ways at this very moment.Whoa.",Null,1,2,18 June 2003
