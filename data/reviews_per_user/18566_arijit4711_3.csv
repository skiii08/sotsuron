Requiem for a Dream," the movie for a lifetime
","Perhaps the hardest thing to portray beautifully in a movie is to show the vulnerabilities of human beings without losing the plot. Kudos to Darren Aronofsky for his mind-blowing direction.A great work with the camera with superb innovations like split screen techniques.The film starts with a light note surrounding the 4 central characters and then with time delves deep into the murky & horrific world of drugs.Everything starting from the direction to acting is so terse and pin-pointed. This is a film that is so distressing and depressing and yet a food for the soul.The true consequences of drug abuse is shown in a brutally genuine way. Jared Lato and Jeniffer Connelly deliver their best performance as vulnerable youths whose lives are shattered due to a vicious nexus of drug abuse.Even Marlon Wayans delivers a nice performance.The horrific turn their life takes will simply numb you. But the show-stealing performance comes from Ellen Burstyn who breaks every ground of acting while portraying the character of Jared Lato's mother, a loner who wants to get back to her olden days & in the way falls prey to drug abuse in the form of diet pills.The horror in her eyes that grows day by day as the movie advances will cause a lump in your throat. And in the end of the movie the director justifies why the movie is titled so.While Ellen Burstyn has to be admitted to a hospital for electroshock therapy where she remains only a shadow of her old self, Jared Lato also ends up mutilating his hand due to rotting of it by drug injection.Jeniffer Connelly is forced to prostitution to satiate her needs for drug and Marlon Wayans lands up in jail and is shown to dream of days when he was young and used to sleep like an innocent boy with his mom. The metamorphosis of the characters from simple people into shattered selves is simply heart touching. This was a movie which unjustly missed on Oscars. At least Ellen Burstyn should have been awarded for her role.The depiction of a lonely lady, the longing to eat, the horrific hallucinations and at last a finished character was played superbly by her that is unparalleled. Its heartening that the movie is at 60th on IMDb's list of best movies but i would have liked it to be within best 30. This is a movie which will numb your senses at least for sometime after you watch it. Its not a tear jerker and neither a documentary but the portrayal is tremendously disturbing and dangerously true. I recommend everyone to watch it and get a true angle to drug abuse. Its a cinematic beauty as well as educational. Please watch it. A complete 10 on 10. Nothing can get better than this.",Null,0,1,20 March 2010
Rockstar," Disilussioned direction
","A big let down from Imtiaz Ali. As a director of better movies like Socha na tha, Jab we met and Love aaj kal, I was expecting a very good film from him and even was quite excited on seeing the promos. But at the end Imtiaz made a caricature with neither any plot development and nor character development. Any sane person willn't be able to relate to the pain, agony and the anguish through which the protagonist traverses. Neither the love shown between the duo was worthy nor the passion of music inside Ranbir Kapoor was consistent. What baffled me most was the fact that each time the hero finds her love, he forgets everything about his music. This is pretty bullshit because one who adores music in such a way can never be a rockstar. For a rockstar, his music is his life..And even the eccentricities that are so prevalent in a genius are portrayed so absurdly. Even one doesn't understand about the genesis of his anguishes and to whom they are directed and why the hell he is angry.Newcomer Nargis Fakri is adorable until she opens her mouth and acts. Her acting is just so cold and frigid. Ranbir excels but alas, the director makes a mess. A.R. Rehman is brilliant but the songs don't make any sense on screen, though when you listen it offscreen you will marvel at Rehman's creativity. Story and Direction sucks, I can't be more modest than this. The director presents an utter wrong impression of a rockstar and their oft followed path of self- destruction..Rather he confuses and amuses us with such a 'bang your head on the wall' type movie.Many people have loved the film and that's very evident from IMDb ratings too, but any person who goes with a preconception of watching a movie on a rockstar's life, his priorities and eccentricities, his road to self-destruction and actualization etc etc will be severely disappointed. The only silver lining is Ranbir's acting and Rehman's music.In a nutshell, the movie completely wasted a mindblowing concept and made a total shitty mess. Not at all expected from Imtiaz Ali. My heart pains to criticize Imtiaz but I can't give it more than 4 out of 10.",4,0,2,24 December 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," the true meaning of being a father
","one of the most fantastic film that is timeless.everyone,especially wills smith gives a stellar performance that will break the myth that wills smith is good for only fun movies.superb direction and portrayal of father-son duo....i think everybody would have at least shed a drop of tear while watching the movie....especially the scene where wills along with his son is forced to spend the night in a toilet.these types of films are few and far between...in fact even wills smith knows he has played the best character of his life...after watching the film you too will feel like going to your father,hugging him tightly and confessing that how indispensable and vital he is for your existence....at least watch it once",8,0,0,20 March 2010
