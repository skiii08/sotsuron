Black Swan," Did I see the same movie you did?
","It's 'Psycho' with ballerinas. Or 'High Tension' with ballerinas. Or 'Repulsi√≥n' with ballerinas. Or 'Sisters' with ballerinas. Only the ballerinas aren't actually ballerinas but actresses and body doubles portraying ballerinas.The artwork and cinematography are stunning, and it has a stellar cast. But when modern Hollywood wants to tell us a descent into madness, the fall is so glitzy and stylized that it becomes one trope after another.I can't believe it won awards.",4,2,4,2 December 2019
Footloose," Don't like teen movies or dancing? See it for the gorgeous Utah scenery.
","Yes, the plot is predictable. Yes, the characters are each wearing a gallon of Aquanet to hold their 80s hairdos in place. Yes, the premise is dopey.But it's fun.",6,3,4,2 December 2019
A Quiet Place," Family movie with monsters
","Beginning writers are taught that any shotgun that appears in the beginning of the first will be used to set off an inciting incident to start the second act. Krasinski uses a noisy child's toy, but he follows rule to start his movie and show us the universe in which this family lives. The problem is that he follows all the rest of the writer's rules, too, and what we get is a story we have all seen before. There's an apocalypse that creates danger for a family, because coming of age teenager becomes an adult and a parent sacrifices everything.The movie works best if you overlook the enormous plot holes, the contrived danger and the preposterous premise, and concentrate on the relationships between rhe characters. Krasinski is on to something in the way he portrays the way they care about each other, and he might want to think about making that
movie instead of this one.",5,1,3,2 December 2019
Unknown," Of course you've seen the 'amnesia victim as hero' story before
","But rarely has it been with Liam Neeson, who proves once again that stars don't have to be in their twenties to make a good action film. He's helped in this movie by a stellar supporting cast, the beauty of Berlin in winter, and the lingering tension change is bringing to refugee Europe.It's a well made and engaging film, with a sly nod to way the strange bedfellows of the Cold War keep climbing back under the covers together.",7,0,0,7 December 2019
