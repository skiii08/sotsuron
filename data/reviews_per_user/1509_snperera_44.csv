The Ring," such a great horror film!
",Omg!!! This is such a great horror film because it has such a unique and interesting concept and story!!! I loove this movie so much because the imagery in the movie is so beautiful and eerie and creepy! The acting in this is sooooo good!!!! Naomi Watts is such a great actress in this and you go on the mystery with her and you want to know more about the tape and the story behind it. Samara is soooooo amazing!!!! I cannot believe a young girl did this role!!! The actress knocked it out of the park because she not only was scary but you got to see her backstory and see why she is the way she is. I loove this movie so much and whenever I watch it I know I wont be able to sleep!! This is such a great horror film that doesn't rely too much on gore or jump scares.,8,2,2,8 February 2017

It is so entertaining, kind, sweet, thrilling, and romantic. The message in this movie is so timeless and whenever kids see it they will be reminded to show kindness to others and to look pass looks.

The Notebook," one of my favorites
","Such great acting and such a powerful love story. I actually prefer it to the book. The chemistry between Rachel Mcadams and Ryan Gosling is so perfect and so beautiful. I always wished that they were together in real life they are so cute together. Anyways, it is such a simple story but it is told with beautiful imagery and great scenes. Even the enemies in this movie own and you hate them so much!!! Rachel Mcadms and Ryan Gosling will always be in the list of my favorite actors and actresses.

Moana," what a delight!
","Wow, what a great great movie! The visuals in this movie are breathtaking!! They are so gorgeous! But, besides the visuals there is such a heart and imagination and creativity to this movie. Moana is such a likable, smart, and relatable person. the voice work for Moana is so sweet and so good. The chemistry between Moana and Maui is so great and so natural. The songs in this movie are so charming, catchy and fun! But, How Far I'll Go is such an emotional song and it has such heart...I dare say I like it a little more than Let It Go! The way Moana sings it and you can feel it!! Wow, I just looved this movie and it is great for kids and adults. I will always love it and I wanna see it again!",8,117,171,8 February 2017
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," a great, great movie!!
","Omg! Johnny Depp is so talented in this movie. From the beginning of the movie you can really see his pain and his turmoil and you understand why he is the way he is. He has such an amazing singing voice and the story is so charming and sad and the other actors in the movie are so good as well. Helena Bonham Carter was very good in this movie and her and Johnny's chemistry is so amazing! When they sing together, I love it so much!!! Without spoiling anything, I will say the ending is so hard and I didn't see it coming. My favorite song from the movie is A Little Priest. Such a great song!! I will always loove this movie. Even though it is a dark movie, that's what I love about it.",9,1,2,7 February 2017
Shutter Island," love it!

It is a beautiful looking movie and you feel the darkness and eeriness and you want to know what is going on.,8,0,2,24 February 2017
Tangled," Rapunzel is my second favorite princess!
","This movie is so sweet, heart-warming, and charming!! Rapunzel is such a kind and likable and you can relate to her in the movie on how she wants to go out and see the world. Some of us our in own 'tower' of life and we haven't gone out and explored the world. This is one of the funnest, sweetest, and funniest movies ever! Flynn Rider is also a great character and I am glad that he is not like the typical Disney prince. This movie has such catchy and fun songs! I love When Will My Life Begin and I See The Light and I've Got A Dream. I loove Mandy Moore so much and I am so glad that she is a Disney princess. She has both the singing and acting voice for it. This movie will always be a favorite of mine.",9,2,2,7 February 2017
Corpse Bride," loove this movie

Lion," great!!
",Right from the trailer I knew that I wanted to see this movie! I love true stories about hope and I love stories where people find their loved ones after years apart. This is such a great story. The kid acting is great and you really feel for the little boy and you want him to find his mom. Dev Patel is so great and so strong in this role. He is a likable guy and you also want him to finally find his biological mother. This movie has such heart and it such a beautiful story. The world needs more stories of hope like this. I love this movie and I love the message of the movie. I would recommend this story to anyone who says that there is no hope or good in the world. I love that this a true story and that we got to see the people the movie was based about at the end of the movie.,9,0,1,8 February 2017
Forrest Gump," a classic!
",Tom hanks is so great in this film and he brings so much to his character. His chemistry with all of the other characters is great as well. It is so sad when his mom and bubba dies.

I will always love this movie and it will never get old to me.,9,1,1,16 March 2017
Edward Scissorhands," A classic!
",a classic movie! Johnny Depp is so great in this movie and her really gives his all in this role. He is such a likable and sweet character and he is so innocent and just wants to have a normal life. The chemistry between him and Winona Ryder is so believable and sweet. I will always love this movie and it will always be one of Tim Burton's greatest works.,8,1,1,24 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," I looved this movie! What a surprise!!!
",when I saw trailers for this I wasn't that excited for it cause I knew that it wasn't going to be another Harry Potter film. I was so surprised by this movie! I fell in love with it! It brought me back to the magic and mystery of Harry Potter but it was also very original. Eddie Redmayne was so likable and sweet and unique and smart in this film and I fell in love with his character!! I fell in love with the other characters as well and it was such a great story!!! The beasts in this film are so unique and awesome and you want to learn more about them. I love that this is another part of the Harry Potter story but doesn't try to be and it does reference it but not too much and it really takes u on a journey.,8,0,3,8 February 2017
The Conjuring 2," Very good movie
","Wow, such a scary movie!! Vera Farmiga has to be one of my favorite actresses ever! She cares about her roles so well and she puts such heart to them! I love her in Bates Motel as well. I believe I liked this better than the first one. The first one was so great but I just didn't care for the other characters in the story, but this one I do. I feel so bad for the little girl and the family and I want the Warrens to help her and her family. The whole family is great and you really feel for them. This is such a creepy and scary movie and the special effects in this movie are so great! I will always love the Conjuring movies and after seeing this I do consider them some of my favorite scary movies. The one thing I absolutely love about this movie is that Faith plays a big part in the movie. I am a Christian and it is so refreshing to see a scary movie that has faith as one of the main parts in the movie when so many scary movies don't. I love that faith plays a big role in Ed and Lorraine Warren's marriage and family. This stuff is real and I love that this story is based on real events. It shows that God is real and Satan is real as well.",9,0,1,8 February 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," a powerful story
","wow, such great acting and such great and simple dialogue. The characters have such great chemistry. I love that in this story that you got to see the characters grow to being friends into loving each other. The characters really care about the people that they are portraying and they try to be as real and authentic as possible. This is such a sweet and great love story. Spoiler Warning: The ending to this movie is so rough and so hard. We all know that he is gonna die but when it happens you can't help but feel so empty and heartbroken. The Ed Sheeran song to this movie alone is so sad as well. I love this movie and I want to read the book and compare both. such great acting and Shailene is such a talented actress.",8,0,0,7 February 2017
Twilight," twilight!! wow!
",I know people have their opinions about Twilight...but I love this movie and the whole Twilight franchise. The acting isn't that bad in my opinion and it is a fun and entertaining movie and I think that all the actors have fun in their roles. I like the chemistry between Edward and Bella and I like the mystery and adventure in the story. I will always love the Twilight movies.,8,1,3,27 February 2017
Liar Liar," a lovely movie
",Jim Carrey has to be one of my favorite comedians ever!!! I love him so much! He gives such heart and energy to his roles and I love him for it! He is so good in this movie. He is such an unlikable character at first but then after his son makes that wish and he isn't able to lie anymore you kind of feel for him. You can tell that he really loves his son and that all his son wants is to spend more time with his dad and for his dad to not break his promises. This is such a sweet and charming story and I believe this is one of Jim Carrey's best performances ever. He really gives it his all. Especially in the boardroom scene. I will always love this movie and it will always be a classic to me.,8,0,1,8 February 2017
Frozen," omg!!!!! wow wow
","loved, loved, loved frozen!!! such an amazing and magical experience. the movie had such purity and beauty to it and it had such a great message of sisterhood and friendship and love. i loved that Disney showed that guys can be deceiving and you think their princes but their really not. Frozen is a timeless classic and it can never be replaced and children will be talking about it for decades to come. I love love love Disney and Disney did this again. Disney always makes me movies that i will never not love :) thank you Disney, thank you. also great casting! Idina and Kristen's voices work perfectly together and i just loved it! I loved it!",8,7,14,9 December 2014
Room," amazing
","I have read this book and I loved it and I was hooked. I was so so excited when I found out that there was going to be a movie! Jacob Tremblay is so powerful, inspiring, and adorable in this movie! The chemistry between him and Brie Larson and is so beautiful! This is such an inspiring story about survival, hope, and family. What makes room so powerful is because the majority of the book and the movie is in the 'room' and how Jacob Tremblay's imagination is in 'room' is so so amazing! My sister cried when she saw it in theater's and I didn't because I don't cry easily at movies but if I did I would be bawling my eyes out. This movie isn't for everyone, but for those who can handle seeing abuse, etc go see this movie! :)",10,0,3,6 February 2017
A Quiet Place," A fun time at the movies!
","There are so many good things to say about this movie. I had goosebumps throughout the whole movie. John and Emily and the kids were so good in the movie and they had such heart and chemistry. The monster in this movie is terrifying as well. Such great suspense and emotion and it felt so real and authentic. I loved that we only saw this family's journey through this apocalyptic world. Normally, in movies like this you see other characters that don't matter. I love this movie and it 
is one of my favorite thrillers.",9,2,5,12 April 2018
Hidden Figures," what a delight!
",such a beautiful movie! I love this movie and the powerful message behind it that woman can do anything they set out to accomplish and that being black should be something to be proud of!! the acting is so sweet and great and the three main woman in it have such great chemistry and they actually seem like they are really friends. I love that this is a true story!,8,3,10,26 February 2017
Toy Story," A classic friendship story!
","Wow, well what can I say! This is a favorite of mine. The voice work in this movie is so great and so natural. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have such amazing chemistry and you would think that these 2 were actually friends!! Omg, the heart that this story has is so sweet and the main song in it is a classic as well. The side characters in this movie are so sweet and great as well. Mr. Potato Head, Bo Beep, Slinky, Hamm, all of them have such chemistry and energy to their performances. I love how it is in the point of view of the toys and we get to see their lives. One of my favorite scenes is when the army men see what presents Andy gets for his birthday. Aah, I cannot say enough how much I love this movie. It's funny and original and I will continue to love it forever.",9,0,1,8 February 2017
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2," A great ending to a great series!
","I know, I know people have their opinions about the Twilight films but...I love them. I know they aren't the best movies and I know the acting isn't that great but its not so so bad where I don't believe the emotions of the characters. But, this movie is entertaining and it's fun! It has a lot of energy and I believe that the actors wanted to end the series on a high note as well. Throughout the movies I really enjoyed Bella and Edward's love story and I know that the movie doesn't really portray a theme to a lot of people. But to me, the theme of Twilight is that you should do whatever you can to protect your family and the ones that you love. I also like that the love triangle also ends in the movie and the last one and it's not about that anymore and it's about protecting renesmee. I will always love these films.",9,0,1,8 February 2017
Beauty and the Beast," A magical experience!
","Just saw this and wow all I can say is wow! I know people have their views on these Disney live action films but people need to realize that Disney knows these films will never ever be like the animated versions. But, in my opinion I love this just as much as the animated version. There was such magic and wonder and adventure in this film!! Emma really shows so much heart and strength to this role and she really is Belle! All of the other characters are so great as well!! I got goosebumps to the core when I saw this and I wanna see it again! :) Emma gives so much to her role as Belle and she is so strong but can also have a quiet confidence to her. She is everything you love about Belle and more and I think her singing voice is so pretty and Dan Stevens voice as the beast is so great and his song evermore that he sings is so beautiful!",9,9,27,16 March 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," This is my favorite Marvel movie!
","So, I watched the first one and thought it was good but than I saw this and I was blown away. The effects and the worlds and planets they have in this movie is amazing. I love the heart in this story and that's it's not a typical superhero movie. I love the chemistry between all of the actors and it is such a funny and fun movie. Baby Groot is so cute! This is such a feel good movie!",9,0,1,19 February 2018
Titanic," A classic!
","Wow, well what can I say that hasn't already been said. these are some of my favorite actors and they are in a tragic love story!! How amazing! Leo and Kate have chemistry that is so perfect and so sweet. In the movie they really feel like they are friends that grow into a loving relationship. The imagery is gorgeous and the story has such heart! It's still so terrible that this is a true event that has happened. I couldn't imagine being on the ship when all of this was happening. There are times that it was slow but other than that I will always love this movie. It will always be a favorite! Leo is such a great character in this movie and he is such a likable character and Kate is as well.",9,2,3,7 February 2017

I love all the movies and books.",9,2,3,27 February 2017
A Beautiful Mind," loove this movie!
",I love this movie so much! Wow what a great story and I cannot believe that it's based on a true story. The acting is so great in this movie! Russell Crowe is so amazing in this film!! You really feel for his character and you feel bad that he has this illness. Russell Crowe is such an interesting and unique character as well and he is so smart and you really go into a journey with him. I love that this movie really show that mental illness is a real thing and that it shouldn't be stigmatized at all. This movie makes you feel for those who are dealing with mental illness and you want them to get the help that they need. I will always love this movie and it will always be a favorite of mine and it will always be a favorite of mine.,8,0,0,17 February 2017
August Rush," such a sweet movie!

Wonder Woman," She became my favorite superhero!
","I freaking love this movie! I came into this movie with expecting a good time. I didn't come into this movie thinking that I would walk out and having Wonder Woman become my favorite superhero! She is so pure, kind, accepting, welcoming, intelligent, witty, and compassionate. She empowers everything good in the world and in people. I haven't seen the original Wonder Woman and I haven't read any of the comics with Wonder Woman but I saw this and I fell in love with Wonder Woman and she is so inspiring to woman everywhere.",9,3,5,17 April 2018
The Greatest Showman," An amazing musical!!!!!
","So, when I first saw the trailers for this movie I didn't want to see it because it was about the start of the circus and I am completely against circuses with animals in them and I know the real PT Barnum was a bad guy but I decided to see it because I love musicals and Zac Efron and now I've already seen it twice!!! The music is so amazing in it and there is such energy and heart in this film! You could tell everyone who worked on it put a lot of work into it. This is one of my favorite musicals ever and I'm obsessed with the songs. This music makes you feel so good inside and it's so inspiring.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Looved it!
","This is how you end a franchise!! This and the Half-Blood Prince will always be my favorite Harry Potter films!!! The story does come to an end so well and you get to see so many characters grow and be stronger! there is so much energy in this film and I believe so many actors cared about how it was going to end as much as the fans did. Harry Potter will always be an icon, a classic, and a brilliant book series by such a powerful and intelligent women known as J.K. Rowling.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," My favorite hunger games film!
","This is such an intense and emotional ride and you better get on. The reason this is my favorite is because I believe Katniss has developed so much in this movie as a character. Spoiler Warning: She ends up having to go to the hunger games again. And when she does she shows that she will not let the Capital defeat her, no matter how many times she gets knocked down. I love the relationship between her and Peeta. He was always my favorite and he develops as a character as well.

This is such an action packed movie and it has a lot of heart. Really love this movie!",9,1,2,6 February 2017

This one is my favorite cause you get to explore Bella and Edward's relationship even more and there's the Spoiler Warning: love triangle with Jacob and Bella and it is just so fun! That's how I would describe the Twilight films..fun and entertaining! In this movie especially there are hilarious moments and I feel like this film in particular has a lot of energy! I will always loove the Twilight films and I do not care what anyone else says about them. They are films that I will continue to re watch in the future.",9,1,2,7 February 2017
Click," wow, what a great movie!
",Loved this movie and it's probably one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies. There is so much heart in this movie!

This movie is so funny and i will always enjoy this movie!,8,1,1,24 February 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," such a powerful movie!
",loove this movie so much!! Andrew Garfield is so amazing in this!! He really gives his all to his role. I cannot believe that this is a true story.

I will never forget watching this movie in theatres.,9,9,15,26 February 2017
Pocahontas," A beautiful classic!
","Pocahontas is one of my favorite Disney princesses. she is such a strong role model and she has such a great heart. she really cares about the environment and her people and I just love her character so much. At times the story can get slow and boring, but the songs bring the story back. Colors of The Wind is one of the greatest Disney songs ever! Period end of discussion. She inspires me to care about the environment. John Smith is kind of a boring character but...luckily we see more of Pocahontas than him. Overall, it is a great story with great music and I believe kids should especially see it so they can get inspired to change the world as well. Will always love this movie and it will always be a favorite.",8,1,2,7 February 2017
Beetlejuice," such a classic!
",Oh my gosh! This movie is so amazing! I love this movie and I will never ever forget it. I think I remember watching it and being kind of scared of Beetlejuice.

There great as well and they are so interesting. I will always love watching this movie during Halloween or anytime for that matter. :),8,3,5,24 February 2017
