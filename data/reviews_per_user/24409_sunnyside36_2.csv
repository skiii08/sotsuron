Iron Man 3," Another lame hero in a lame plot
","Like Nolan's third Batman, where he is portrayed as a cripple, hobbling out of retirement at half strength, here we have an Iron Man lamed with busted and under-powered gear throughout. What are we paying for if not to see our superheroes be super? Then there was the lame plot. Stark dares the Mandarin to come and get him, gives his home address, and then doesn't bother to suit up, all the while having the wife in the house, exposed to risk. How stupid. Equally stupid is that the Mandarin actually comes, with nothing more impressive than a few missile firing helicopters, despite knowing what Iron Man is capable of, and having no reason to suppose our man wouldn't be all suited up and waiting. Or at least have his radar turned on.",6,1,2,10 May 2013
The Love Guru," A case of the audience failing the movie
","The low marks this movie is getting is a case of the audience failing the movie.If you were not entertained by this, you might not be a red-neck, but you might be a sourpuss. Or perhaps just be unexposed to the off-America world Myers is referencing and spoofing.Or maybe it helps to be Canadian, if only to have a taste for humane humour.In any case, I think it is quite brilliant, laugh-a-minute fun and silliness. I admit Jessica Alba's acting is a bit wooden, but who cares. And the mop fight scene actually was pretty disgusting. But Mike Myers has created a delightful character here. It is a great parody of the new-age/guru industry, without being actually denigrating. The humour is at times of the so-bad-it's-good genre, with the delivery lifting it from plain groaner to irrepressible guffaw. It's a run of gags and puns and double entendres all the way, and part of the fun is seeing how high he can stack them.The production values are first-rate; it's lovely to watch. The Bollywood parodies make for multicultural novelty, and are a total romp.There's plenty of star wattage. Justin Timberlake is perfect as the Quebecois blowhard goalie. And Ben Kingsley as the cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha Â— come on, give yourself a break. That's funny! I've seen dreck, and this ain't it.",9,4,9,15 November 2008
