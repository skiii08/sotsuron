Iron Man 3," A very good movie, but it has its flaws
","Iron Man 3 is a very enjoyable addition to the Marvel cinematic universe that ultimately falls short of the standard by The Avengers.There are glaring plot holes, clichés, and underdeveloped characters, but there is a lot to like in Iron Man 3. Shane Black manages to inject his own style into the film, giving it a fresher feel. The dialogue is crackling and witty, and the performance from Robert Downey Jr is, as always, top notch.Unfortunately, the fresh direction from Black cant overcome traditional superhero movie tropes, but that's expected from Marvel films. More glaring are the villain's muddled motives and Rebecca Hall's character who is basically a throwaway aside from the opening scene. Not only is Hall's character a throwaway, but so is the young boy that Stark comes Ito contact with about 1/3 through the film. That entire plot point felt unnecessary and more unrealistic than most points in the last two Iron Man films.Overall, Iron Man Three is fun to watch if you want some action and a few laughs, but if you're looking for something like The Dark Knight, look elsewhere.",5,1,2,14 May 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A good film that suffers from a slow start
","Xarnis's review: It seems I'm in the minority here, but I like this movie. I don't know of its because i've read The Hobbit, the trilogy, and the Silmarillion, or what. And while it's definitely not as good as the original trilogy, it does a fair job of setting up the next few Installments. Unfortunately, at some points, it does feel bloated and uninspired.The performances are pretty good all around, but the standout is Martin Freeman. With this and Sherlock on BBC (where he plays Watson), Freeman has proved himself as a great actor with some good comedic timing. The effects are spectacular, and the battles are well-choreographed. The score is basically the same as the original trilogy, but it's still enjoyable. The effects, and the performances make you feel like you're back in Middle-Earth again.One highlight scene happens between Martin Freeman's Bilbo and Andy Serkis' Gollum. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's great and makes you sad that Gollum won't appear in any of the later movies.Unfortunately, the film has quite a few faults that cannot be dismissed. It's length could've easily been cut down to 2 hours, and the early portions of the film (especially a scene featuring actors from the previous trilogy) are fairly boring. The Dwarfs introductions were especially painful, but said dwarfs (the first five or so) have important roles to play later in the story. The ending is questionable as well, as is much unneeded content.Overall, I found The Hobbit enjoyable. Maybe I'm giving too much credit because I'm a fan of the books, and can appreciate some of the extra content. I still liked the film on second watch, and I hope the next installments will make up for this one's faults.",7,7,11,11 March 2013
Platoon," A Great War film held back by the lead performance
","Going into this film, I had no idea what I was in for. I expected a mere, gritty war tale, and Platoon is not that. It's a powerhouse of a film that is disturbing, intense, and at times, grotesque.The film follows a Platoon of soldiers during the Vietnam war, and the main protagonist is the naive Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen). The the plot progresses the platoon through Chris' arrival, the power battle between Sgt. Barnes and Sgt. Elias (Tom Berenger and Willem Dafoe respectively), and to a series of events that illustrate the horrors of war.The technical aspects of the film help in this illustration The editing, cinematography, and sound all come together to form a technical tour de force. This is one of the most technically accomplished war films I've seen to date.The power battle between the two sergeants is the most interesting part of the film, as one officer represents the way war is perceived by outsiders: valiant and noble; while the other represents the true nature of war: grotesque and brutal. The film's standout performance comes from one of these soldiers, and that belongs to Tom Berenger as Sgt. Barnes. He's a ruthless and brutal man, and plays well opposite Willem Dafoe,mwho is also quite good.On the other hand, Charlie Sheen's performance was one of the film's faults. His Voice-over is monotone and boring, as is most of his performance. There are a few moments where he shows some chops, but they were too few, and too far between.My only other issue with the film isn't a problem per sey, and the film actually benefits from it. But with this film being so graphic, it's hard to see myself watching it a second time.Overall, Platoon is a great war film that is, unfortunately, Held back by its lead performance while still managing to show us the dark side of the battlefield.",8,0,1,11 March 2013
The Great Gatsby," Much better than expected
","'I'm Gatsby'I went into this film with significantly lowered expectations, based on critic reviews and early response and I must say: Gatsby surprised me. Luhrman's previous films have been hit or miss with me - I liked Moulin Rouge and hated Romeo + Juliet – but this is certainly his best yet. Despite some flaws, I enjoyed my time watching The Great Gatsby. Its impressive, kinetic visuals; great acting; and excellent story manage to propel it past silly voice-over and some empty characters.Baz Luhrman's style is truly unique, and I can say I've never seen a film that's quite like The Great Gatsby. The lavish parties are incredibly energetic and fun to watch, despite some wonky editing. The sets and costumes are equally stylish and manage to add some personality to the classic tale from F. Scott Fitzgerald. Said story is excellent in this film translation and it's quite faithful to the book. It is a story of hope, tragedy, emptiness, and decadence and these themes make the transfer to film well. Unfortunately, Luhrman uses voice-over from Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) to explain these themes instead of giving the viewer the pleasure of dissecting them.That being said, Maguire and the rest of the cast do very good in their roles. DiCaprio and Joel Edgerton are the standouts, with Elizabeth Debicki also delivering an impressive sophomore performance. Maguire is good, but he doesn't add anything special to his character, and Carey Mulligan was the weakest of the cast. She has moments of greatness, but those moments are eclipsed by her spurts of sub-par line delivery.I'm a lover of Fitzgerald's book, and re-reading it this past week may have given me a bit of bias going into this film. Reading the book just before the film helped me feel connected to the characters. While there are obvious development issues, it was easy for me to overlook them, given the fact I had read the story of these characters only days earlier. I enjoyed watching The Great Gatsby, probably more than most people. Luhrman's was a good choice to bring this ageless tale to the screen, and I'm sure if it was anyone else it would not have been as good. The acting, the style, and the story combine to form a very good film, which could have been better, if it was given a little more thought.",8,1,3,14 May 2013
The Godfather," One of the best films of all time
","How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a 'masterpiece,' and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close.Most already know the story of The Godfather. It's a narrative that's complex, yet simple and it's story that's fluid and interesting. It's complicated, but the story is told with such ease, it's like watching a master artist at work. The Godfather is superb storytelling at its finest.The story's fluidity has very much to do with the characters. The men of the Corleone family are all distinct and interesting, due to the stellar performances. Of course, the standout here is Marlon Brando as Vito, the aging Patriarch of this crime family. He's simply magnificent whenever he's on screen. That's not to discount the other great performances from the rest of the cast, which includes Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuvallThe film is technically brilliant as well. The cinematography is stunning, with the more bright colors jumping off the screen, while the blacks set the mood well for darker story moments. The sound is more subtle in its accomplishments, but when you hear the chatter of machine guns, it makes your heart skip a beat.It's hard to pick my absolute favorite film of all time. I could easily say Lawrence of Arabia, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or Lord of the Rings. And I could also easily say The Godfather, as most others have done. But I don't like making such conclusive statements. But don't worry, Godfather. It's not personal. It's strictly business.",10,1,1,11 March 2013
