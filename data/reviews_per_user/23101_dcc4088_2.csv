Requiem for a Dream," What's behind doping in this film ?
","Honestly, it is a easy-followed-plot story. After first glimpsed of the movie, several things impressed me are those award camera angles and the fast cutting montages on the end part,and of course the hash and bleakness sound track is quite inspiring that pull me into narratives. When i watched it on the second time, i endeavour to explore metaphors through the plot.Clearly, everybody know drug addiction devastates healthy life but on contrast this phenomenon has become part of youth culture. Besides physical ecstasy it bring on, one more important function of drugs for kids is the psychological sedate, which in most of the cases is an effective way of curing emotional isolation or domestic abuses,etc. As we can see from this movie, three characters have their owe problem, Sara, who dreamt of a glamour performance on a TV show, is under a motivation of self-esteem achievement in order to grip her memorable charm. But her son Harry with a more complicated intention of his drug addiction and dealing, on one hand, he tries to make money to prove his value to his mom, one the other hand, it is a only way he can though to support his girl friend's garment business. His girlfriend Marion is a real tragedy, in the beginning, she totally screw her life after initial attempt of helping her boy friend. Harry's friend Tyrone, as director repeated mentioned in the screen, he simply want to be a big man as his mother hoped. Therefore, we can see that they were all motived by very positive intention, but end in bleakness. It really triggered me to think that whether institutions and authorities should engage in more strike regulations and scrutiny to stop prevalent drug abuse phenomenon among British society as a whole?",Null,0,0,9 August 2012

I remember one scene in the beginning, when Szpilman try to show his willingness of devoting into rebellion, a man said' you are artist, your job is inspiring people.you musician don't make conspiracy, you are too musical'which is a satirized and self-esteem-hurt expression but is true on that peculiar period.
