The King's Speech," IMDb Spell checker
","I was going to review this movie but being English I was distracted by my review being spell checked by the IMDb spell checker.IMDb spelt and spelled are both acceptable.Americans generally opt for Spelled British English is not English English.There is no such thing as British English.There is American English which is quite honestly crass.Is this 10 lines yet? My point is, take Spelt off your bloody spell checker.After all we English invented the language.You buggers are destroying it.Like everywhere else.",Null,2,3,6 August 2016
In Bruges," No Spoilers here. I have to keep pausing soak it in.
","I think this is my first review on IMDb but some of the comments I read have provoked me. I haven't even seen the end yet, but after watching The Kingsman and Eddie the Eagle last night, I have to say it is lovely to see so many good films in English (or even Irish) English. I'm half Irish half Irish working in China, and thoroughly enjoying this on my PC. It makes me wonder if the Yanks get our dark underdog humour on our little Great islands? I don't want to sound anti-American but with Trump and Clinton running for President they must have some sort of sense of humour. (Humour spelled correctly with a U as in U arseh0les)Yes IMDb I know this will never be seen, I just wanted to vent my spleen.",10,0,2,6 August 2016
