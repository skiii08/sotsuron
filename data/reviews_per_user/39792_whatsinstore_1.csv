The New World," Why did they all walk out???
","First, my compliments to the cinematographer for absolutely beautiful shots of wetlands and sky, birds and rivers...I must admit I came expecting a coherent story about what the director believed happened in 1607 Virginia. It turned into one of the most boring and incoherent pictures I have ever seen. A full third of the audience walked out of this film before it ended. The symbolism was not explained in any way (a boat in the middle of the river on fire, for instance). What did the natives think of Capt. Smith? One minute he's a prisoner, the next, he's playing games! Huh? How about the 30 minutes spent playing in the grass (ugh!).Sorry, I shouldn't be seduced into sitting through a movie like this.",2,2,7,17 February 2006
