Black Swan," A true master-peace by Darren Aronofsky! Natalie Portman at her best!
","To be honest, when i decided to watch the 'Black Swan', the only reason at that moment was Darren Aronofsky, knowing his previous work. And boy, was I right! This movie takes the story of dual personalities to a whole new level of unknown, which is beautifully portrayed by Natalie Portman, taking her to a spot where 'The Oscar' doesn't look like just a dream anymore.It's a touching story, based around a small group of characters, and that's a place where Aronofsky is at his best (i.e. Requiem for a dream). Also, it would be unfair to forget Vincent Cassel, who showed himself in a totally different manner creating a strong, patriarchal character. In the end, this work of art is worth every single dollar and minute you spend on it. It's a guaranteed classic!",10,3,8,22 December 2010
