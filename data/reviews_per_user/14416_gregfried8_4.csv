Skyfall," Skyfall (2012)
","In his debut turn directing a James Bond film, Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) found a way to combine intimate character moments with grand-scale action to construct the type of spy film that made 007 a global icon for 50 years. Daniel Craig returns as Bond, finding a level of comfort in the role we haven't seen in his last two efforts. Less brooding and hell- bent on revenge, Craig brings an effortless swagger previously unseen. Skyfall effectively reminds us why we fell in love with 007, and propels the franchise into a bold new chapter.Skyfall opens with an absolutely gripping chase sequence through the streets of Istanbul, as 007 and a fellow field agent (Naomie Harris) pursue an unknown thug who possesses a hard drive containing the identities of undercover MI6 agents embedded around the globe. The mission goes haywire: Bond is presumably shot dead, and the assailant escapes with the precious information intact. During his time spent off the grid, Bond enjoys a lazy sabbatical consisting of not much more than sex and booze, only to be spurred back to action by an attack on MI6 headquarters.While there hasn't been much continuity when it comes to the personal relationships of 007 throughout the years, his love and loyalty to England is never questioned. Nor has his alliance to MI6 chief M (Judi Dench), who personally needs him now more than ever before. Like Bond, M struggles to remain relevant in the ever-changing world of espionage. This need to adapt or die unites the two. Their initially icy relationship tenderizes over the course of the film, and reaches a level of platonic intimacy rarely seen over the storied history of the franchise.In addition to a battleground that is becoming more opaque and difficult to define by the day, M must also survive the vengeful wrath of Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem). A former MI6 agent, Silva holds M personally responsible for being captured and tortured while on assignment. Bardem's experience playing a deranged sociopath helps him bring a unique mix of charm and menace to the role. While many may be quick to cite his Oscar-winning part in No Country For Old Men as a source of inspiration for Silva, the character he most recalls is Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight. Bardem delivers a fantastic, film-stealing performance, despite limited screen- time.If there is a flaw in Skyfall, it is in the stakes—or lack thereof—seemingly uncharacteristically low for a Bond film. Although it's made clear that Silva is capable of carnage on a grand scale, his mission is purely one born of personal vengeance, and there is no evidence that he poses a threat after his personal vendetta is fulfilled. There is no atomic bomb threatening to wipe England off the map. However, this does not minimize the film. The seemingly lowered stakes ultimately work to make the film more personal for both Bond and the spellbound audience.Working with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (best known for his work with the Coen Brothers), Mendes find unexpected beauty in a wide array of set pieces, including a neon-lit Shanghai skyscraper and the abandoned island from which Silva operates. None of the action is spectacular, but it is at least coherent and effective, especially when compared to the frenetic, pseudo-Bourne styling of 2008's Quantum of Solace. The pacing is fluid, and the film never drags despite its 143-minute runtime. Perhaps Mendes' greatest contribution is the overall tone he delivers to the film. While the previous Craig-era 007's could seem overly dark and cheerless, Skyfall remains incredibly fun amidst its thrilling and violent nature.",8,2,10,12 November 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," Silver Linings Playbook (2012)
","There is a certain type of manic energy that drives the films of Writer/Director David O. Russell (The Fighter, I Heart Huckabees). His films tend to feature ensembles of flawed but lovable characters struggling to piece their lives together while coping with various familial stresses, chemical dependencies and existential meltdowns. Russell's newest film, Silver Linings Playbook, continues this trend by tackling mental illness with a degree of honesty and warmth rarely seen in Hollywood films.Bradley Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) stars as Pat Solitano, a volatile, bi-polar ticking time bomb prone to violent outbursts, serving 8 months of court-ordered time in a mental hospital for assaulting his wife's lover. Early on we see Pat get released, almost surely before he is ready, and begin to pick up the pieces while living in his parents (Robert De Niro and Jackie Weaver) attic. It's clear to the audience that mental illness runs in the Solitano family after meeting Pat's father, an undiagnosed obsessive-compulsive wreck with severe anger management and gambling issues. Driven by delusion and a new optimistic outlook, Pat embarks on a seemingly endless quest to win back the heart of his wife, despite the restraining order she has placed on him. From the start, Pat is portrayed as a filter less social pariah, instantly alienating (if not terrifying) everyone he comes into contact with. That is until he meets Tiffany, a mysterious, young widow played by Jennifer Lawrence. Like Pat, Tiffany is wild, capricious and damaged to the core. Though their initial meetings go horribly, the two eventually connect and form a shaky, co-dependent alliance. Discovering a loophole in his restraining order, Pat enlists Tiffany to deliver a letter to his wife. She agrees under the condition that he participates in a dance competition as her partner. As they begin to spend more time together, the two grow closer and Pat's behavior becomes less erratic. Cooper is fantastic as Pat, combining his natural comic ability with a dramatic awareness previously unseen in his prior films. Nevertheless, it's Lawrence who ultimately shines brightest. In Tiffany, she has created a complex character bursting with comedic energy, sexiness, intrigue and melancholy.Perhaps the Russell's greatest achievement is how genuine and natural Silver Linings Playbook feels. Like its characters, the film's tone is skittish and unpredictable, seamlessly blending flashes of uproarious humor with weighty emotional moments that never seem to ring false. While it's certainly not a conventional RomCom, Silver Linings Playbook is unable to fully escape the trappings of the genre. In an instance of uncharacteristic insincerity, there is a bizarre scene in which Russell makes light of the compulsive behavior of one of his characters in order to propel the film towards a predictable yet satisfying conclusion. It's a minor blip in an otherwise memorable effort.",7,3,6,20 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012)
","When it was announced that Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) would be extending The Hobbit into a trilogy, many wondered how the director would manage to stretch a seemingly brief story into roughly 9 hours worth of epic filmmaking. The first film in the series, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey attempts to recall the epic scale of the preceding trilogy by combining deliberate pacing with Jackson's tireless attention to detail with mostly mixed results. While An Unexpected Journey has its strengths, including Jackson's typically excellent camera work and charming performances from star Martin Freeman (BBC's Sherlock) and Ian McKellen (reprising his Gandalf role from the previous Lord of the Rings films), the film unfortunately feels like an overlong prologue stretched well beyond its means. Much of An Unexpected Journey's first half is spent reintroducing viewers to Middle Earth while also presenting the new cast of regulars who better fit into the Hobbit mythology. Forced to carry more narrative elements than it can handle, the film begins to feel drawn out and unfocused as it progresses. Tone is also an issue here. The film seems too jokey for its own good, cramming its broad humor into so much of the journey that the scenes with more dramatic weight attached to them actually feel like a pleasant change of pace. One scene specifically, featuring a trio of monstrous trolls attempting their best Three Stooges impressions will surely leave some viewers rolling their eyes.Presented in 3D at 48 frames per second (the way Jackson has said he meant the film to be seen), the film often looks like a cross between a video game and the world's most expensive soap opera. There are several truly breathtaking landscape shots, but as the camera creeps closer towards its subjects everything begins to look cartoonish and artificial. The action sequences are most affected, closer resembling a World of Warcraft game than the wonderfully staged battles seen in the Lord of the Rings series. The higher frame rate ultimately seems more like a gimmicky distraction than a technological game-changer. For better or worse, The Hobbit trilogy will always be tied to, and unfairly measured against Jackson's previous Lord of the Rings trilogy. The acting here is mostly strong, the set pieces rich and elaborate, and the narrative primed for a more momentous turn when the series resumes. Still, while it may not be fair to call An Unexpected Journey a bad film, it certainly struggles to live up to its triumphant predecessors.",6,6,18,20 December 2012
Lincoln," Lincoln (2012)
","Straying from the conventions of a true biopic, Lincoln, the newest film from director Steven Spielberg presents a detailed view into the divisive state of American politics during the waning days of the Civil War. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner depict the monumental challenge and vast political opposition President Lincoln faced while fighting for the passing of the 13th amendment into the Constitution. The film is sharp and focused, concentrating less on Lincoln's personal and family life, in order to fully portray his tenacity and drive to have the hotly contested amendment passed before the official conclusion of the war. While this approach largely benefits the film, there are instances in which Lincoln could have benefited from a closer examination in to the President's more meaningful personal relationships. In particular, the scenes between Lincoln and his oldest son (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) seem to lack a certain emotional punch and ultimately seem fruitless and ineffective.The always-stellar Daniel Day-Lewis brings a calm, subdued sensibility to the title role. Day- Lewis does well to depict Lincoln's humanity while maintaining his larger-than-life stature. He's seen in the film as a man of immense power and influence as well as immense charm and wit; always equipped with a joke or anecdote, but commanding and fiery when the situation demands it. As the film approaches its conclusion, Day-Lewis deftly paints the picture of an exhausted Lincoln feeling the full weight of the immense burden he is carrying. It's a brilliant, nuanced performance that further solidifies Day-Lewis as Hollywood's most gifted leading man. In addition to Day-Lewis in the lead role, Lincoln is overloaded with perfectly cast character actors that breathe considerable life in to Spielberg's Washington. Much of the films humor derives from the trio of James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson as slippery Washington lobbyists tasked with securing across-the-aisle votes in favor of the new amendment through various under the table dealings. Sally Field gives a solid turn as the volatile Mary Todd Lincoln. Anguished by the loss of one son to typhoid fever and the dread of losing another to the war, the film's First Lady is portrayed as someone forced to put on a deceitful smile for White House guests while suffering privately. Tommy Lee Jones shines as Republican Congressional leader and devout abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, one of the many characters in the film faced with the alternative of betraying their own convictions in service of a greater good. Despite Spielberg's reputation as the master of on-screen spectacle, Lincoln confines itself to a platform more fit for a stage play than a motion picture epic. At times the film seems like nothing more than a collection of mostly static scenes depicting men sitting in rooms talking. Despite its few visual flourishes and a brief battle sequence that opens the film, Lincoln could certainly be considered the least purely cinematic picture in Spielberg's illustrious canon. Even with these hindrances, the powerhouse performance of Day-Lewis makes Lincoln a captivating experience, if not quite a classic.",7,2,10,17 November 2012
