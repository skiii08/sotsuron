Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A perfect beginning to a great saga.
","This movie is down right excellent. I think critics attacked this movie just because everyone was looking forward to it. Great story line, great visuals, great acting, and the greatest sword fight in movie history. I was disappointed when the movie only got three Oscar nominations and didn't win any. It fits in perfectly with the classic trilogy and I cant wait for episodes 2 and 3. My score: 10 out of 10",Null,0,0,14 April 2000
The Big Lebowski," Are movies allowed to be this funny?
","I have never seen a movie that has made me laugh this much every time I see it. This movie is so hilarious! Not only that, it's pure genius. Everything from the twists and turns of the kidnapping to the laugh-out-loud dream sequences. Every one does a great job acting and it has more memorable lines than almost every other movie I've ever seen. I recommend this movie to everyone I know.",10,0,0,5 June 2000
The 13th Warrior," So underrated!
","This is one of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. I've seen some bad reviews and can't understand them. I read the book 'Eaters of the Dead' by Michael Crichton, and the movie follows it very closely. Antonio Banderas gave a great performance as well as the rest of the cast. The landscapes are beautiful, the costumes are great, and the action is thrilling. I've seen the movie seven or eight times since it's been on video as well as once in the theater. It definitely ranks as one of my all time favorites. Everyone (with a strong stomach) should see this movie. Absolutely excellent!",Null,0,0,14 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A perfect ending, to a perfect saga.
","I have heard a lot of people who say this is the weakest of the original trilogy. I have to completely disagree. This movie is just as strong as it's predecessors. I really loved the ending (especially in the Special Edition). It wrapped everything up really nicely and contained one of my favorite Star Wars scenes. I'm referring to the scene where Luke comes close to suffering the same fate as his father. Like I said, the perfect ending to a perfect saga.",Null,0,0,18 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The saga continues beautifully!
","Ok, I just left the midnight screening of 'Attack of the Clones,' and all I can say is WOW!  This movie was absolutely gorgeous.  Hayden Christiansen was a brilliant Anakin Skywalker, Ewan McGregor was great as usual and Yoda... well, see the movie yourself and giggle like a giddy school girl at Yoda.  Now, I am one of the few defenders of the Phantom Menace.  I think it was lighter than the other films because Lucas was trying to portray a much more peaceful time in the galaxy.  Yes, Jake 'Mannequin Skywalker' Lloyd was not the greatest actor and yes, Jar Jar Binks brought out the dark side in us all.  But one thing I think happened was just what I said would happen. Phantom makes a lot more sense now!  Now we know that Jar Jar was there for a reason: (spoiler alert) To bring down the Republic!  The master plan of Darth Sidious is much more clear now, Anakin's path to the dark side has become more evident, and the birth of the Empire is imminent.  I think I can slip my Episode 1 dvd in now and breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that Lucas, the emperor himself, has everything mapped out and everything is going according to plan.  So I urge everyone to see Attack of the Clones and if you didn't like Phantom, go back and watch it again after seeing this great movie.  Maybe you'll smile, shake your head and say, 'Ok, I get it now.'  Well done Mr. Lucas.  Well done.",10,0,0,16 May 2002
Mission: Impossible II," A good, yet a little mindless action movie.
","This was a pretty decent movie. The story was only ok and the love story sucked, but action was outstanding. I usually don't like movies that is basically carried by its action but this was really damn good. I won't begin to compare it to movies like 'Life is Beautiful' and 'Saving Private Ryan' but it is a nice movie if you want to see explosions and some edge-of-your-seat-action. Just don't see this if you want to walk away thinking, 'That better win an Oscar.' However, if you just want to say, 'Ooh,' and 'Ah' at some nice action, this will not disappoint.",7,1,1,5 June 2000
Titanic," So overrated!
","I really can't understand what anyone saw in this movie. Everyone talked about how great it was, but it was just three hours of my life I want back. The love story was pointless and just plain annoying. The only decent part is the actual scenes where the boat is sinking. However, I would much rather watch a documentary about the Titanic than to ever watch this movie again. This is one of the last movies I would want to see as the number one money maker of all time. My Score: 2 out 10",Null,4,7,14 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Perfection has a new name and it is Star Wars!
","Completely perfect. Not a thing wrong with it. This movie is, in my opinion, tied with three other movies for the greatest ever made. The three others being Episodes 1, 5 and 6. It took a genius like George Lucas to make a film this great. I first really saw the movies in 1990 when I was about ten years old. I have never seen their equal since.",10,0,2,16 April 2000
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A perfect sequel to a perfect movie.
","Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope was a tough act to follow. However, Lucas did it with Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Without a doubt, it is the darkest of the Star Wars films (until Episode III comes out anyway) giving it a real dramatic feel to it. It also reveals the true fate of Anakin Skywalker. One that had audiences around the world gasping in surprise. Also contains one of the greatest sword fights in movie history.",10,0,0,18 April 2000
Gladiator," good ... not great
","This was a damn good movie. Did it deserve the Oscar for best picture? No. It was good but not the great epic it was made out to be. The acting was ok. The storyline was ok. In fact, the only thing it deserved to be nominated for was special and visual effects. Even so, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was better, and it was also MUCH more deserving of the best picture award. Good movie but did not at all deserve that Oscar.",7,0,0,26 March 2001
