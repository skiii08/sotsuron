The Sound of Music," A Personal Recollection
","The winter of 1967 I was 9 years old. My 4th grade teacher, Mrs. Newby packed up our class and headed to San Francisco to see a movie: The Sound of Music. We drove through the hippies and the sleazy theaters of North Beach 'til we came to the movie house where the S.O.M. was still in its initial release. I sat next to my teacher.(I was her pet I guess).The lights dimmed, the overture started and then the most beautiful girl I had seen started singing. I sat in my seat transfixed by the show. Here was something rare and special. Music and words and kids my age on screen. Magic happened that day to me. I didn't know what a Nazi was, nor where Austria was but it was important to my teacher that I learn. Mrs. Newby sat silent during the film until the last reel. She wept as the von Trapps crossed into freedom. I didn't know what that was either. I do now. When the Iron Curtain fell in Europe my teacher was on the other side. Like Maria she and her family escaped East Germany to come to the west. Perhaps as Matlin says this is a bit of corn...but not for me, not for my teacher, and certainly not for those who never made it out. This was the LAST great musical made. It was made entertaining and suffers from closer examination of historical truths, but it is AN IMPORTANT FILM. You do not have to be a victim of the Holocaust or escape from a totalitarian state to appreciate why. I could go on but others have said what I would have. I easily give it 10 for 10. Only Casablanca and Citizen Kane rank higher on MY all time list. See this film and show it to your children...and their children. Charles",Null,0,5,1 May 2001
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," The Real Meaning of Spielberg's Fantasy Masterpiece
","I saw ET at the premiere in 1982 and have not seen it since then until I picked up the DVD set a few days ago.  Without too much embellishment I have the same feeling for it now that I did then: this is one of the best motion pictures ever made. How could I have remembered every scene from 2 decades past, nearly every significant word of dialog, every note of the score, if it had made no impression on me from the first viewing? Because it went straight to the parts of me that define me as HUMAN. It would be pointless to over-critique ET; small and trivial aspects of it have lost their luster. So there is an ATARI console, so Drew Barrymore has taken on less sweet roles as an adult. The cheesy effects in The Wizard Of Oz do nothing to detract from the essence of the film. In this case the essence is the same: Home. It is a word that is as intangible to define as freedom or truth or....faith. 'Phone home' he says, 'There's no place like home.' says Dorothy. THIS is the essence of the movie...it does not take a Roger Ebert or Leonard Matlin to uncover this fundamental (and yes, sentimental) truth. Spielberg captured all that was possible to capture on film about the nebulous nature of needing to be home. For each of us, for every human being, there is a place we call home. It may not be the place we live now, or it may not even exist anymore except in our memory, perhaps we shall never find such a place. But we all know what it shall be like when we are there. Spielberg's film says that the concept of home is not only a human desire, but perhaps even a universal one as well.     I think he is right.I believe if you don't understand or feel these feelings after viewing then somewhere along the road of your life you have lost some part of your humanity. True,it is just a movie. And Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is just another song. And The Last Supper is just another fresco...",Null,2,4,28 October 2002
Casablanca," Casablanca at 60
","With the possible, arguable, exception of Citizen Kane, this is THE finest piece of celluloid ever to exist. I give it a notch over Kane because it has the romantic interest of Bergman and Bogey (Elsa and Rick) as a second powerful sub-plot. The casting is perfect, the story is exciting, supporting characters have (in the ensuing 6 decades) become as memorable and important as the leads. If you buy DVD's, get this one or Kane first. These films will be the basis on which to compare all others that have come before or after. If they are dated..well then so be it. Great stories transcend time (how many remakes of Romeo & Juliet exist for example?) and Casablanca is such.The multiple tales of human folly, fear, death, hate, love and living for a higher purpose are seamlessly integrated into a hundred-odd minutes of magical story telling. Will anyone make a film like this again? No...that would be impossible. Perhaps come close but never exceed this perfect example of the motion picture arts. And art it is. If it were a painting it would hang in the Louvre, if a song, comparable with Beethoven's 9th, if a book, it would be on the shelf next to Shakespear's First Folio. Enough...see the movie...again.

The Grapes of Wrath," My Family's History in film
","Ma Joad was my mother. That is to say her and thousands like her out of the Dust Bowl of the '30s and '40's . I never got to ask ma about those days, she died before I knew that this movie and her life were the same. But my oldest sisters were born in transient camps just like the movie..people were alternately mean and kind just like the movie. When I watch the camp scenes they are as my sister's described them. The director (Ford) has nailed that episode of American history (or just a slice) deftly jumping from the hopeless to the hopeful that these folks lived through.    This is a social film true...but it is also a well told morality play with some of the finest words committed to celluloid.  Hard to beat Steinbeck . I have the newly restored Fox DVD...excellent quality. They did a faithful restoration. You should never pick up a head of lettuce or put on a cotton shirt without thinking of this film after viewing it.   Me....I just remember Ma.",10,10,14,21 July 2004
