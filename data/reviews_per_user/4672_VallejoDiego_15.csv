Ford v Ferrari," Bale. Damon. Enough said.
","Matt Damon and Christian Bale have the best chemistry on screen I've seen all year. It's a bummer they didn't know who to push for the acting category for the Oscars. Because they both should be nominated. The story of this movie is great and the performances are great. The small issue I had is it was slow at times with the 2hr 30min runtime. But with this story, I get why it is this long. James Mangold does an amazing job with this movie. He is probably the most underrated Director working right now. He can pretty much do any genre and it's good. Overall, Ford v Ferrari probably won't win Best Picture but It's still one of the best movies of the year.",9,3,4,3 February 2020
First Man," A 4k Blind buy. And did not disappoint.
","First Man was a Black Friday 4k blind buy. I had seen Damien's first two films and loved them. (La La Land and Whiplash). But I missed First Man in theaters. But dam this movie was really good. Strong performances and sad and inspirational Neil Armstrong Biopic. Sure it feels long at times but once the Apollo Mission starts, it takes off! The Score when the moon landing was happening was AMAZING. And the whole Moon scene on IMAX looked amazing. Overall this movie was really good. Damien Chazelle is on a roll and can't wait for his next film.",8,1,1,10 December 2019
Hereditary," TRAGIC story and a GREAT Slowburn Horror movie!
","I recently saw Ari Asters 2nd movie, Midsommar, and I really liked it. Hereditary, his debut feature film, is also REALLY GOOD. This movie came out last year and realized the main Actress from this movie didn't get nominated for an Oscar! HOW?! Her performance was amazing. Really the whole caat was GREAT. This is a Slowburn movie but it's a good one. There's this horrible accident in the first act of the movie and the story just keeps you invested. Most of the scares are in the 3rd act. And they are creepy to look at. My only really flaws with the movie is that they try to involve the son with some girl and they touch on it for like 3 minutes and never again. Thought that was kind of weird , unless I missed something where that was very important to the story. And also the last couple of minutes of the movie. Ari Aster basically explained via dialogue the ending of the movie. I get why he did it because it would've been very confusing for audiences but it would've kept them thinking and have them rewatch or research more about the movie. Overall, Hereditary was GREAT. Ari Aster is off the a terrific start with his first 2 films and can't wait to see what he does next!",8,2,6,10 October 2019
Taxi Driver," AMAZING FILM. MAYBE Scorseses Best
","So I had seen this movie before and LOVED it. The reason I watched it again was because of 'Joker'. And after watching Taxi Driver again, you can definitely see the inspiration for Joker. Taxi Driver is a Dark Character Study about Travis. And Like Jokers' Arthur, he suffers for insomnia and mental illness. So I can't say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's AMAZING, it's DARK. Oh and the Score is just so so GREAT. If you LOVE Joker, watch this now!",10,4,6,25 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Fun and Good ending to The New Trilogy.
","Yes this movie is not Empire Strikes Back. But it is far from being as bad as Attack of The Clones. Yes the story is kind of all over the place (especially the 1st act, it all moved so fast) and there are holes in the story. I won't lie, some of this movie tries to retcon some of The Last Jedi, with a character that is not a spoiler anymore because he's in the trailers and posters, The Emperor. I feel JJ Abrams threw in the Emperor in this movie from the hate received by fans from The Last Jedi. It's hard to review this movie without giving spoilers. So to keep it short, I enjoyed watching this movie. I think it's a good ending to this Saga and by far, I mean by far! Kylo Ren is the best character out of this whole Trilogy. Adam Driver yet again is great as this character. Also don't listen to others reviews, go and watch the movie yourself, and judge it yourself.",7,1,10,20 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino does it again!
","The 9th film of Quentin Tarantino is really good! Brad Pitt and DiCaprio SHINE in this movie. Their chemistry is spot on and should both be Oscar nominees. Tarantino once again ,without spoilers, changes history. If you go into this movie expecting Violent Tarantino, you'll be disappointed. This is more Jackie Brown On the level of violence. But this movie is of course still worth watching if you're a Tarantino fan. It does not disappoint",8,2,4,10 December 2019
1917," Amazed for almost 2hrs.
",This movie reminded me a lot of Dunkirk. Which I loved. It throws you in the War instantly and you follow our characters to see if they survive. Bravo to Sam Mendes and Rodger Deakins for making such a beautiful movie. Every scene is just amazing to watch and the score is one of the best of the year. This could potentially be the winner for Best Picture at this years Oscars. And it deserves it. Not only is it one of the best movies of the year but one of the best 'War' movies EVER. Please do yourself a favor and watch it.,10,1,4,31 January 2020
Midsommar," BIZZARE. TRIPPY. DISTURBING.
",Those three words sum up this movie perfectly. Midsommer is my first watch from Ari Aster. (Hereditary I will watch soon and will review later this week). But this movie looks so BEAUTIFUL. And the performances are GREAT. Especially the main character played by Florence. She maybe deserves an Academy Award nomination for this movie. That's how good she is. Like I said this movie is disgusting and hard to watch at times. A lot of 'what is going on' scenes and I respect Ari for not holding back. As far as issues. It's a little lengthy. I love long movies but I feel this movie suffered at times and could've easily been chopped down to exactly 2hrs and it would've been fine. Last but not least the way this movie looks... Is AMAZING. This again deserves a Oscar nomination for best Cinematography. It's just gorgeous. I recommend this movie for anyone who really wants to see a weird bizzare movie that is still very good.,8,6,8,8 October 2019
The King," GREAT Performances. And one of the BEST Netflix Original movies
","Now first things first I am no History expert. So I don't even know how accurate this movie is. But I am judging it off just a Film alone. And this movie is so GOOD. Timothee Chalamet gives a GREAT Performance as King Henry V and so does the rest of the supporting cast. The score is really good and so is the story of the film. The story is so relevant now about war. Especially the reveal at the end. It's about every recent War we have in real life, what was the reason for it?? The beginning of the movie is a bit slow but it isn't enough to turn off a viewer like me. Check it out. It's on Netflix and is definitely worth the watch!",8,5,9,17 November 2019
Joker," JUST AMAZING. How does this movie exist.
","Let me start off by saying if Joaquin Phoneix doesn't get his Oscar for this movie. Then the Oscars should be cancelled. Phoneix is amazing as you might've heard from every review ever! But Todd Phillips. Is at his best here. The story lines he takes and visuals are just breathtaking. The score!! Omg the Score! Every time that score came on, I felt very uncomfortable, like something horrible was about to happen. It was GREAT. The Inspirations from Taxi Driver and King of Comedy are there, and add so much for the movie. And I got to be honest. There are scenes that are very violent. And its disturbing. But I honestly expected it to be WAYYYY more violent from all the controversy going on. Overall this movie was GREAT. Come Oscar season, it needs to be nominated for Best Picture, ScreenPlay, Cinematography, Actor, Score and Director",10,2046,2660,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Just OKAY. But could've been GREAT! (Minor Spoilers)
","IT Chapter Two is the most recent movie I have seen this year. So it is still fresh in my mind. Having said, this movie had a lot of potential to be great. Let's start off with the Cast. Nothing was wrong with the Cast at all. Every Actor and Actress were so perfect for the older Losers Club. (Especially Bill Hader). On a Comedy level this movie is great just like the first. But unfortunately the scares were average. Though a scene when Pennywise eats a kid with McAvoys character in a glass maze was one of the film's best scenes. This movie also starts off really strong when one half of a couple is
the first victim of Pennywises' return. The 2nd act is where this movie loses its steam. Right where the characters wander off on their own to find out why they've return to the town gets really slow. (Also the movie never really touches on why the Losers Club can't remember almost anything. It's just glossed over) Fortunately, the movies 3rd act is solid and redeems the very slow 2nd act. The wrap up for the movies is strong. I still recommend seeing this movie if you were a fan of the first movie. Just don't go into it thinking it's going to be GREAT.",7,7,11,24 September 2019
Parasite," Oscar Season is here
",I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.,10,11,16,29 January 2020
The Big Short," Movie was NOT for me. BUT doesn't mean it isn't for you.
","Let me just start off by saying this movie was NOT for me. I'm going to be honest, I might be a little dumb for this movie. I might need a rewatch. But I respect Adam McKay for not dumbing down the movie for anything, except for those cameos with Margot, Selena Gomez, explaining things to us. (Or maybe it was dumbed down lol). But just because I didn't understand it doesn't mean I'm going to give it a bad rating. This movie is filled with fantastic performances from the whole cast. Also the editing of this movie is what honestly made me keep watching. Some people might find it annoying but I thought it was terrific editing. Overall, this movie has a good true story, filled with amazing performances, and amazing editing. But this movie isn't for everyone. Just keep that in mind.",7,2,3,26 September 2019
Marriage Story," Best Performances in a Movie this Year? But will they win?
","The biggest takeaway from Marriage Story after watching are the Performances. Like Wow! Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson shine in this movie. Both of them should be nominated for Best actor and actress. Obviously the big talk about this movie are the Performances but this movie tells a story about what I'm sure happens to a lot of couples. Their jobs get in the way from them trying to be a parent and when getting divorced they use that against you. This movies screenplay alone is what makes this movie. The dialogue is almost perfect. I don't see this movie losing in the Oscar Screenplay category.(unless another great writer, Tarantino, wins). Even though I think Adam Driver gives his best performance of his Career in this movie. I do think he loses to Joaquin at the Oscars. Scarlett who is strong, gives another STRONGER performance in a different movie this year. Overall, watch this movie if you want to see World Class acting and a powerful story.",9,3,4,13 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Funny. Beautiful. Sad.
",JoJo Rabbit is probably the 2nd most controversial film in the Best Picture Nominees but it's still great. Roman Griffen Davis gives a great underrated performance and Scarlett gives maybe her best this year. Taika gives a good funny Performance playing Hitler. (So weird to say). JoJo Rabbit is a roller coaster ride of emotions. You could be laughing at all the jokes then all of a sudden in tears. Has such a great story and message to anyone who sees this movie. Oh and Sam Rockwell is great. The costume designs are also great as we see them from the perspective from JoJo. Overall it's a great watch and would definitely recommend.,9,26,47,5 February 2020
