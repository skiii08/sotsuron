Vertigo," James Stewart's greatest performance
","Although Hitchcock made good films before and after the 1950's, I think that the 50's were his true purple patch. Between 1950 and 1959 Hitchcock directed 11 movies. Here they are.'Stage Fright' (1950). 'Strangers On A Train' (1951). 'I Confess' (1953). 'Dial M For Murder' (1954). 'Rear Window' (1954). 'To Catch A Thief' (1955). 'The Trouble With Harry' (1955). 'The Man Who Knew Too Much' (1956). 'The Wrong Man' (1956). 'Vertigo' (1958). 'North By Northwest' (1959).I challenge you to find a single clunker on that list. You won't, because there aren't any. I know the mechanics of Hollywood in the 50's were different, and there was a much faster turnaround of product, but 11 great films (some true classics) by the same Director in 10 years is going some and more. He never won an Oscar, but Hitchcock was a really great Director. That fact should never be forgotten.I have seen 'Vertigo' on TV many a time, but never on the big screen. 'Vertigo' might be Hitchcock's strangest film. Ostensibly it is a melodrama. (An ex-Detective, traumatised by the accidental death of a colleague, and suffering from a chronic fear of heights, is hired by an old friend to follow the friend's wife, as she has started behaving strangely.) Of course, the story is much deeper than that. 'Vertigo' is about mental illness, obsession, betrayal and, yes, necrophilia. In a great career it could be James Stewart's greatest performance. 'Vertigo' also looks beautiful and the colour scheme tells it's own story. (Red=health, green=illness.)It's a masterpiece. 'Nuff said.",8,2,3,7 May 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Wonderful
","Every day in the Extra's section of the Independent newspaper they publish a quick guide to the best five movies (plus plays, exhibitions and everything else) that are playing at the moment. I'll cheat for a moment and just repeat what they have to say about 'Borat'.'Better not to think too hard about how this wicked mockumentary works its tricks. Just be ready to book a seat and laugh like a hyena.' Frankly, I couldn't have put it better myself.'Borat' really is very, very funny. I thought that it was possibly the best out and out comedy of the year. There are spoilers in the next couple of bits, if you want to skip them.'Borat' is not perfect.Of course some of it was simply taking aim at soft targets (the feminist group, the crowd at the football match that were upset at the mangling of the national anthem, the three yahoos in the van).Of course Pamela Anderson was obviously in on the joke at the end. (Would her bodyguards have let her run distressed around a car park? Nope. They would have gotten her straight out of there.) Of course the hero is racist, sexist, ignorant (his belief in the Kazakstahn scientist who had evidence that the female brain is smaller than that of a squirrel - I might use that some time, ha! ha!) and offensive (I particularly liked the traditional Kazakstahn celebration of the 'Running Of The Jew' - open mouthed shock doesn't quite cover my reaction.) Of course some innocent and well meaning people were made to look foolish (the dinner party).And, finally, of course the legal waters here are particularly murky. Exactly by how much were the participants misled? What did the legal releases they signed (and I'm assuming that some kind of legal release was signed) actually say? But, do you know what? Didn't matter a jot to me. I thought 'Borat' was wonderful.One question. Are all New Yorkers really as paranoid and rude as those in the film? Surely not. Or was it the best footage that the producers came up with? Very funny, though.",7,0,5,9 May 2007
Deja Vu," Perfectly OK
","For a long time I could never get on with Tony Scott's movies. Loud, brash, crash edited and rubbish would be my description of most 'em, with some exceptions, 'True Romance' and 'Man On Fire' . Those were both great films.'Deja Vu' is.... OK. It's not terrible, it's not a masterpiece. It is a perfectly OK movie. That's a victory for Tony Scott! It is preposterous and ridiculous, and like most time travel films is full of holes, but I enjoyed it well enough. Hardly anybody in the cinema, though. Where was everybody?Sometimes your Denzil Washington's and Val Kilmer's need to do a job just to pay the rent, don't they? This is such a job. But it's not a bad time, truth be told.",5,3,6,9 May 2007
In Bruges," Existential comedy?
","After a hit goes badly wrong, two hired killers (one of them older, experienced and word weary, the other raw, inexperienced and emotional) are ordered to hide out in the city of Bruges in Belgium, and to await further instructions from the Boss. Why beautiful, old, scenic Bruges, where nothing much happens, and when it does happen, it happens very slowly? Ah... Well there is a reason, which is crucial to the plot, and I am definitely not going to go into it here.It's hard to know how to describe 'In Bruges'. Maybe it would be best to describe it as an existential comedy? I don't know. All I will say is that, if Samuel Beckett or Harold Pinter had been commissioned to write an action movie/buddy-buddy comedy, they might have come up with something like 'In Bruges'. There are definite echoes of 'Waiting For Godot' and 'The Dumb Waiter' in the dialogue, the situations and the characters.Simply put, 'In Bruges' is just a gloriously funny and so-black-light-bends-into-it comedy. A brilliant confection of poetry, cynicism, innocence and slapstick. Great turns from Brendan Gleeson as the older, philosophical hit man Ken and Ralph Fiennes as barking mad Essex dog Harry, possibly the most unstable British gangster seen on screen since Ben Kingsley in 'Sexy Beast'. Maybe surprisingly, for some, Colin Farrell shows what a fine performance he can produce when cast in right part. His young killer, Ray, is a mixture of willfulness, innocence, childishness and regret. You feel for him. Really you do.'In Bruges' will not be a box office smash. It is probably too lyrical and introspective for huge success, and also it has hardly been promoted, but I have no doubt that it will find it's audience as a cult movie on DVD and on late night Indie movie channel screenings.It's a great film. You should go and see it. Really you should.",8,1,4,23 April 2008
Kung Fu Panda," Not a disaster, just a bit disappointing.
","It is not a disaster, but I thought that 'Kung Fu Panda' was a bit disappointing.'Kung Fu Panda' is big, bright and colourful (and, by the way, looks wonderful in an IMAX DMR print). It does have wonderful animation, some nice comedy sequences and good characters, but 'Kung Fu Panda' is not nearly as funny as it could have been, and is severely lacking in character.I think the worst crime of 'Kung Fu Panda' is the waste of a potentially top class voice cast. Half the fun of modern animated movies, especially for adults, is in the spotting of various celebrity voices having fun. 'Kung Fu Panda' manages to leech all of the character and idiosyncraticness out of the voices of fine character actors like Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and others, that you may as well have used a cast of unknowns.A real shame, then, but not a total waste. My Nephew (12 years old) liked it. My Niece (11 years old) thought that it was OK.",6,3,5,25 August 2008
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Not a disaster, not a masterpiece
","I have thus far been nearly immune to the talents of Judd Apatow and his merry band of funmeisters. I have never seen 'Knocked Up' or 'Superbad' or 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby'. No doubt one day I will. I have seen 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' and 'Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy' on TV and found them... well... OK, I suppose. Not really my cup of tea, but nothing awful enough to make me want to change the channel.I went to see 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' last Monday. So, why exactly did I bother to see it, when everything in the press has pointed out that it is exactly the same as every other Judd Apatow produced movie?Frankly, nowt else on at the cinema that I could be bothered with. (Indy? 'Sex And The City'? Thank you, but No.)'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' again, is OK. Really it is. OK is good and better than not OK. Not a disaster, not a masterpiece, but OK and alright, and it does the job it sets out to do. Funny in parts, grossly rude in others. Some nice performances from Jason Segel, Kristen Bell and the UK's very own Russell Brand. Interesting to read that Russell Brand is generally considered to have stolen every scene in which he appears, when Brits will tell you that what he is doing is a watered down version of the standard shtick he has been using on British TV and radio since his UK breakthrough a couple of years back. Still, if it works, why not?'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' has done the expected business in the UK and the States and is a competent piece of comedy. Could be a lot worse.",6,5,13,5 June 2008
Black Book," I really love Paul Verhoeven
","I really love Paul Verhoeven. I love his outrageousness. I love his chutzpah. I love the way he only seems to have a limited knowledge of political correctness and chooses to give it the finger when he encounters it. I love the way he turned up at the Razzies to collect the Worst Film and Worst Director awards for 'Showgirls' (sure it's bad, but it's entertaining). I've not seen his early films, but I have loved everything since 'Flesh + Blood' in 1985.'Zwartboek' is interesting because if you take away the extreme sex, violence and horror what you are left with is an old fashioned Sunday afternoon WWII melodrama. You know the kind of thing. You've seen it a million times. In the dying days of WWII a plucky Jewish singer, hiding out from the Nazi's, starts to work as a spy for the Resistance. She dyes her hair blonde (all her hair) and starts to get close to a senior Nazi. She falls in love...So far, so typical, but it is a good film. Not a film, perhaps, that he would have got away with making with an English cast. (It's mostly in Dutch.) There is a interesting ambiguity in that not all of the Nazi's are bad and not all of the Resistance are good. In fact, some of the Resistance are as racist as the Nazi's. Verhoeven winding up his audience again? Good man.",9,2,4,7 May 2007
Pirate Radio," I would not call it a work of genius, but...
","'The Boat That Rocked' will not trouble the Oscars next year. I would not call it a work of genius.Reasons?The film did not have a plot. A series of sketches strung together is not a plot.The film was set in 1966, but the music cues were all other the place. This could have been because eithera) the producers were incredibly slack in researching the music that would have been played on the radio during the period that the film is setorb) the film was actually a piece of science fiction, as the DJ's appeared to have access to a time travel device, allowing them to obtain and play music from the future.(Examples? Oooh, lots. 'Let's Spend The Night Together' and 'Jumping Jack Flash' by the Rolling Stones (1967 and 1968, respectively), 'H-Ho Silver Lining' by Jeff Beck (1967), 'A Whiter Shade Of Pale' by Procol Harum (1967) and 'Crimson and Clover' by Tommy James and the Shondells (1969). There were more. Have fun finding them yourself.)The film was 129 minutes long. 29 minutes too long, in my opinion. I suppose that a broad comedy can be longer than 100 minutes and still work, but you would need a better director than Richard Curtis to make it work. As with his previous film 'Love, Actually' (which I actually like a lot), I felt that Richard Curtis is a better writer than a director. Another director might have made 'The Boat That Rocked' a tighter movie.There was a whiff of sexism about 'The Boat That Rocked'. Just a whiff, but a whiff nevertheless. Society has moved on, guys. There were strong, capable women in the 1960's, but none in the 1960's of this movie. Why not?So, 'The Boat That Rocked' was a disaster then? Yes?Well, no, because 'The Boat That Rocked' was mostly a funny, unpretentious and entertaining film. It had a soundtrack that was out of this world, idiosyncratic performances (does anybody pout quite like Bill Nighy or lick a microphone like Rhys Ifans?) and was just a nice, feelgood movie. Honest injun. I left the cinema with a big smile on my face and bought the soundtrack album the very next day.The critics have not been kind to 'The Boat That Rocked'. Hell! Who cares what any critic has to say? 'The Boat That Rocked' was not a classic, but give it a go. You might like it.",7,13,26,19 April 2009
Hot Fuzz," Not bad
","I work with a guy who saw 'Hot Fuzz' at a preview screening. He came into work the next day and announced that it was 'The best comedy of all time!'Er... No. It's not the best comedy of all time, but it isn't bad. Yes, it is too long, but it's mostly very funny and I thought (blasphemy!) that it is probably better than 'Shaun Of The Dead' (which also wasn't bad, but not as brilliant as everybody thought it was). A riotous mickey take, especially towards the end, of those high octane action films that we love and loathe. Lots of great cameos (see if you can spot a very well known Australian Oscar winner) and a great supporting cast of British character actors hamming it up. Great soundtrack of British pop music, as well.",7,0,0,7 May 2007
Juno," Could have been much more than a kooky, feelgood, idiosyncratic movie
","This may sound like an awful fudge, but I am not exactly sure how to take 'Juno'.On the one hand 'Juno' is really funny, has some great performances (especially from Ellen Page, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner) and perfectly picks up on the idiom of smart teenage slang. On the other hand, the story that unfolds is all very nice and neat and tidy, and not nearly conflicted or dramatic enough.For instance...Yes, I know it was only a plot device to prevent Juno from going ahead with the termination (no pregnancy, no movie!), but was it really necessary to paint the abortion clinic in such an unpleasant light? Very clichéd, very dull and certainly not the experience I had, a few years ago, when I accompanied my Sister to a similar establishment. It made it too easy for Juno to make the decision that she did.At the end, would a girl like Juno really have just given up her baby without a second thought, or a glance backwards? Would she have immediately have taken back up with the boy who made her pregnant? What about his feelings? Or his Mother's? What about her parents? They more or less just agreed straight away with what she wanted to do? Way, way too understanding and I didn't believe it. Juno is a smart mouthed, but nice, 16 years old girl. What does a 16 year old girl know, or boy for that matter?I am writing as though I didn't enjoy 'Juno', but that is incorrect. I did enjoy 'Juno', but it could have been much more than a kooky, feelgood, idiosyncratic movie.",6,5,13,28 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Too long, too loud, too boring
","'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End' is too much.Trust me. It's not a recommendation.It is too long, too loud, too boring and there is too much stuff going on on screen. Utterly confusing and incoherent. As for the acting... I know that it is too much to expect anything more than acting broad strokes in a Summer Blockbuster tent pole release, but Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were personality vacuums and Johnny Depp was not nearly as funny as in the previous movies. And Keith Richards cameo? OK. I admit it. I did smile when he appeared.Keef rules! Yes, 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End' cost a lot of money, and make no mistake, the money is all up there on the screen ( the special effects are astounding), but it is a terrible, terrible movie in almost every other way possible. Repeat after me, special effects alone do not a movie make.I hear that 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End' has just won the best movie in the MTV awards. Ah... I take it all back, then. Stupid children.",2,0,6,6 June 2007
Zodiac," Very good and definitely worth a view.
","Really interesting, multi-layered, factually dense, ensemble piece based on the investigation into the Zodiac murders of the 1960's/1970's. As much about the human cost of the investigation on the people involved (policemen, reporters and their families) as it is about the murders and the murder suspects themselves.'Zodiac' is an old fashioned and naturalistic movie. It wouldn't have been out of place if it had been released in the 1970's and helmed by somebody like Alan Pakula or Robert Altman. This should not put you off. Old fashioned craftsmanship is good and David Fincher has done a fine job. I think that 'Zodiac' is a much better movie than 'Panic Room'. David Fincher is back to being the peak-of-his-game Director that made 'Seven' and 'Fight Club'.Not a single bad performance in the entire movie. 'Zodiac' is very good and definitely worth a view.",8,1,2,28 May 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," 'Sick' and 'awesome'
","I took my Nephew to see this on Sunday afternoon. He used words like 'sick' (which apparently means 'really, really good') and 'awesome', to describe it. I don't think I would disagree with one word of that.I really enjoyed 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army'. I thought that it was better than the first 'Hellboy' movie.It is action packed and very funny (great slapstick), and as far away from the brooding and dark comic book hero as it is possible to go. Hollywood take note. It is possible to make a good comic book movie without having to go 'dark' on the material. I read recently that, with the success of 'The Dark Knight', it is believed that a 'darker' take on the next Superman movie, and other movie adaptations of DC characters, is the way to go. Rubbish. Horses for courses. 'Dark' will not work for every adaptation. Here is a crazy idea. Try making the next Superman a not boring film. That is the way to go.Anyway...'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' would be nothing without it's cast. Ron Perlman was perfect as Hellboy, and so was Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. Nice to see Doug Jones this time being able to use both his body and his voice as Abe Sapien. I also really loved Seth McFarlane's ectoplasmic scientist Johann Krauss and the 12A rating pushing German pronunciation joke. My Nephew especially liked that one.It is extremely important to point this out. 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' is a stunningly beautiful looking movie. Imagine the creatures of 'Pan's Labyrinth' multiplied by a thousand and you will get some kind of idea of the range and variety of creatures that fill the screen during the Troll Market sequence. Amazing. Really amazing.It is such a shame that a lot of movies have been squashed during this Summer of 'The Dark Knight'. According to IMDb 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' only just made back it's budget on it's US release. Hopefully worldwide 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' will do well enough to give us a 3rd movie.",7,1,4,25 August 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Beautiful and melancholic piece of work
","Oh, wow! I liked 'Pan's Labyrinth' a great deal.Not having read any reviews I somehow got it into my head, probably because the lead character is a young girl, that 'Pan's Labyrinth' was a film for children. It is most definitely not a film for children. It is a very dark, violent and brutal fantasy set in 1944 during the immediate aftermath of the Spanish civil war.A young girl moves with her heavily pregnant Mother to be with her adoptive Father, a captain in the Spanish army (a supremely cold and ruthless Sergi Lopez), who is occupied leading the fight against anti-Franco/Fascist resistance. Here she discovers a fantasy world of fauns, fairies and doorways into other worlds. That is all you are going to get from me with regard to the plot. Nothing else, Jack.Go and see 'Pan's Labyrinth'. It exceeded my expectations. It is a truly beautiful and melancholic piece of work and it works on all sorts of levels.Please beware, though. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is (eeek!) a subtitled movie. Do not let this upset you. You can do it. You can read and watch pictures at the same time. Be big. Don't be like the teenage couple who left 10 minutes into the film when I saw it just before Christmas. I waved goodbye to them, as they left. I am sure that they enjoyed 'The Santa Clause 3' that was showing on the screen next door.",9,1,3,9 May 2007
Ocean's Thirteen," Great film
","Pure and simple 'Ocean's Thirteen' is an old fashioned entertainment. Nothing more and nothing less. An obviously contrived (but all films are contrived, you fool!), hip, cool, finger clicking, jazz glide of a movie. Beautiful people, dressed in great suits (or in Ellen Barkin's case a great dress), bouncing off each other. Smart dialogue. The camera work is wonderful, switching between styles with ease. 'Ocean's Thirteen' looks absolutely wonderful.'Ocean's Thirteen' also seems to be a very democratic movie. You do not get the impression that it is dominated by Clooney, Pitt or Damon. Everybody in the gang has reasonable screen time and has a part to play in the heist. They all make the most of it. The actors look like they were having a ball.Great film. The one Summer blockbuster this year that I have truly enjoyed.",8,0,1,1 July 2007
Gone Baby Gone," See it
","May I start by saying that I quite like Ben Affleck. Sorry, but there was a real need to write that. I will explain.Of late Ben Affleck has been on the promotion circuit in the UK. After many delays 'Gone Baby Gone' has finally gotten itself a UK cinema release. It has been interesting to observe that in literally every single interview with the man, there has been a comment on the supposed antipathy of film critics towards Ben Affleck as an actor.Well, I certainly wouldn't consider Ben Affleck to be the greatest actor of his generation. He is not even the greatest movie star of his generation, which, of course, has got nothing to do with acting ability. This, as I see it, puts Ben Affleck into the same category as 99% of the actors working today, and those people do not get the same level of criticism.Who to blame? The tabloids? The fame game? The fact that for a period of time Ben was in love with J-Lo?Oh, dear. Give the guy a break, will you, please?So, then. Ben's directorial debut. Will the critics like him more as a débutant Director? Is 'Gone Baby Gone' worth a look?Oh, yes. You just might say that.'Gone Baby Gone' is, perhaps, not as completely assured a Lehane adaptation as Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River' (the revelatory final 40 minutes maybe could have been paced a little better), but it is frequently a very good and sometimes great movie. Casey Affleck proves that his breakthrough in 'The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford' was no flash in the pan. His baby faced, quiet and introspective private investigator, with a streak of street wise steel running through him, is just a brilliant piece of work. Definitely one of the performances of the year. Casey Affleck is the pivot around which 'Gone Baby Gone' turns. He is rarely off screen and easily holds his own against great turns by Ed Harris, Morgan Freeman and the Oscar nominated Amy Ryan. Only Michelle Monaghan is a tad underused as Casey Affleck's sidekick/girlfriend, although she does have a great couple of scenes towards the end.'Gone Baby Gone' is much more than just a private investigator/mystery/thriller. It is a throwback to one of those great Robert Altman and Arthur Penn movies of the 1970's. Downbeat, naturalistic, subdued, bleak, with an almost documentary feel. Real streets and real people, not film sets and actors playing it downtrodden and dirty. 'Gone Baby Gone' swims deeply in some very murky and morally dubious waters. This is the question: How prepared are you to do the correct thing, when it is not necessarily the right thing?What would you have done when faced with the question posed to Casey Affleck at the end of the film? Do you lose your soul or do you lose your conscience?See it. 'Gone Baby Gone' is one of the best films of the year. I cannot recommend it enough.",8,0,0,9 June 2008
The Bourne Ultimatum," An astoundingly great piece of action cinema
","I spoke to the God-Of-Film. He was a bit busy whispering in Zack Snyder's ear about the forthcoming adaptation of 'Watchmen' (which was an interesting coincidence in itself because, up to a couple of years ago Paul Greengrass, who directed 'The Bourne Ultimatum', was slated to direct 'Watchmen'), but He gave me a couple of minutes.I said to Him, 'I want 'The Bourne Ultimatum' to be the best action film released this year'.He said, OK.I said, 'I want it to have a sly, almost non-existent humour'.He said, Sure.I said, 'I want maximum intensity and minimum dialogue'.He said, Fine.I said, 'I want dizzying camera work, global locations, in-your-face fight scenes, heart pounding chase sequences (on foot and in motor vehicles), serious men (and women) doing serious business behind serious computer screens, double crossings, secrets, great performances, murder, mayhem, violence and, finally, closure.'He said, Anything else?'Yes. I want Matt Damon looking confused and tortured, but as tough as hell, and I want the Goddess Julia Stiles looking foxy.'He said, Done deal my friend.The God-Of-Film. He often lets me down, but not this time.All joking apart, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' really is an astoundingly great piece of action cinema. My first 9 out of 10 of the year. (10 is perfection, which is impossible.)Unmissable. Run. Run to the cinema. You still here? Go!",9,2,4,17 August 2007
Burn After Reading," 'Burn After Reading' is good. It is very good.
","I have a strange and disturbing relationship with movies made by the Coen brothers. More often than not I will go to see one of their films at the cinema, dislike it intensely, dismiss it and then months or years later, after re watching it on DVD or TV, discover that it is actually a little masterpiece. It happened with 'The Big Lebowski' and 'Fargo'. It didn't happen with 'The Ladykillers' and 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' (I hated them both) or 'No Country For Old Men' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There' (I loved them from the start).I wasn't even going to bother to see 'Burn After Reading'. No particular reason. I just didn't fancy it. A lot of A-listers acting dumb in a clever-clever movie? Nah. Thanks, but no thanks. It was only a 'I've-missed-the-bus-what-else-is-on-at-the-cinema?' scenario that led me to deciding that it might be worth a look.I am so glad that I did. I thought that 'Burn After Reading' was kind of wonderful. Farce is a very difficult thing to pull off, but with 'Burn After Reading' the Coen Brothers manage it with aplomb. I thought it was a very funny film.I think the key to the success of 'Burn After Reading' was down to the way that the Coen Brothers cast every single role perfectly, openly utilising the common public personas of their very strong cast. Frances McDormand is kooky. Brad Pitt is a himbo. John Malkovich is strange. Tilda Swinton is an ice queen. J. K. Simmons is gruff. George Clooney is... what else? A ladies man. (George Clooney, in fact, is truly superb and has never been funnier.)Of course the plot is guff. Some nonsense about spies, secrets, infidelity, misunderstandings and sudden death (very surprising that bit). Maybe the Coens should have called it 'Spy Farce'? Actually, that would have been a pretty good title.'Burn After Reading' is good. It is very good. Enjoy.",8,2,7,27 November 2008
Watchmen," Possibly the best adaptation that could be made
","Hollywood cannot please all of the people all of the time. Hollywood cannot please Alan Moore any of the time.... And it's a real shame, because if Alan Moore had not chosen to distance himself from the movie adaptation of 'Watchmen', and made it clear that he had no intention of seeing the movie, he would realise that 'Watchmen' was a very good movie indeed. Possibly the best adaptation of the legendary comic book that could be made.True, 'Watchmen' wasn't perfect. The dialogue was more comic book than movie. Carla Gugino and Matthew Goode were underused. Some of the popular music cues were misplaced. (Simon and Garfunkel's 'The Sound Of Silence' is a beautiful and evocative song, and was used well, but appeared in the wrong time period in the movie. Compare and contrast with the perfect use of Dylan's 'The Time's They Are A Changing' over the opening credits.) There was a tad overuse of slow motion action sequences. Some of the density of information of the original book was missing. (Then again, to have fitted it all in, how long would that movie have had to be?)When 'Watchmen' worked, it worked perfectly. Excellent period detail, realistic violence (so brave of Zack Snyder to not compromise on showing the hard violence of the original book to get a more audience friendly certificate), massive scope and beautifully pitched performances. (No better performance than that of Billy Cudrup. A walking, talking special effect, to be true, but his calm serene voice hinted a unknown reserves of power and philosophical intelligence. He was the perfect Dr. Manhattan.)There is a small part of me that feels sad that he will now never see the Gilliam/Aronofsky/Greeengrass versions of 'Watchmen', but Zack Snyder made a great film. It was a hard movie to pull off. He should be proud.",8,2,6,8 March 2009
The Matrix Revolutions," Boring boring boring
","Astonishing special effects - the attack on Zion is worth the price of admission on its own - but this film has absolutely nothing else to recommend it.  It is badly acted, badly scripted, slow, confusing, pretentious and completely devoid of humour.Not very good.  What a clunker, misfire, mistake, etc.  Bad movie.Boring boring boring.",2,0,0,23 November 2003
28 Weeks Later," Good, but nearly undone by a lazy and predictable script
","Thank Christ!'28 Weeks Later' is a modern, and un-ironic for a change, horror film. As fast, kinetic, intense and violent as '28 Days Later'. Also bloody. Very bloody. Some absolutely brilliant set pieces. (The opening sequence, where an almost middle class dinner party rapidly turns into a blood bath, and Robert Carlyle's frantic flight, leaving his wife to her fate. Robert Carlyle's (again - I really like him) transformation from clean to infected and his subsequent rage filled attack on his wife. The moment when the snipers are told to 'kill everything that moves'. The fire bombing of the Isle Of Dogs. A helicopter as an up close and personal attack vehicle. The chemical weapon attack.) Good stuff, but '28 Weeks Later' is undone somewhat by a lazy and predictable script, way too dependant on coincidence. Examples.Two children can avoid detection by the U.S. army, break out of a secure cordon around the Isle Of Dogs, find a motorbike to go back to where they used to live. Then they find their Mother, still alive.What?Robert Carlyle is a trusted caretaker for the U.S. army. Trusted enough, apparently, to have a high enough security clearance to be able to get into a medical facility, where the U.S. army scientists are investigating the rage virus, to visit his wife who is in isolation and is strapped down.Eh?Or the worst thing. Robert Carlyle as super infected man! He keeps popping up like a jack-in-the-box, as his children's nemesis of choice, long after he should have disappeared into the background. One of a thousand infected getting shot, burned or gassed by the U.S. army.Final thing.The climatic sequence under Wembley Stadium, in apparent pitch black, was terribly put together. Maybe it was just me, but I had no idea what was going on. Awful.I don't suppose I cared very much about any of the characters, either.Lots of criticisms, there, but I liked '28 Weeks Later' enough. I did. It is a true rush of a movie, it just isn't as good as '28 Days Later'. Such a shame. Maybe the next film (trust me, a European set movie '28 Months Later' must be on the cards) will be better. Maybe it will become a true saga and we will get sci-fi epic '28 Years Later' a couple of years down the line? That would be interesting.",6,3,6,28 May 2007
21," Clichés aside, I really enjoyed '21'.
","You and I have seen this movie many times before.A talented Innocent is recruited/seduced by an older, devious mentor, with the promise of riches/fame/success if he utilises his talent on behalf of the mentor. Riches/fame/success are delivered, but the effects are corrupting on the Innocent. The Innocent loses everything, but watch out for the twist in the tale...Indeed. Yes. Seen it, done it, lets move on shall we, please?Ah... But hold your horses, there Chief! The reason the above scenario has become such a cliché is because it is used quite a lot, and the reason it is used quite a lot is because can be a really popular and entertaining cliché in the right hands. This brings us to '21'.I thought '21' was just a fabulous, unpretentious, piece of entertainment. Nothing more and nothing less. It has a young, attractive cast (Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth are, frankly, too beautiful to live), the gravity of experienced hands (devious Kevin Spacey and granite-like Laurence Fishburne), a cracking soundtrack (horrible remix of the Stones' 'You Can't Always Get What You Want' aside) and, lest I forget to mention it, the backdrop of Las Vegas looks amazing.So, clichés aside, I really enjoyed '21'.",7,2,3,16 April 2008
The Orphanage," Chilled me to the bone
","There are horror movies that bang you over the head with gore and blood and entrails, and there are horror movies that entice you in slowly with atmosphere and silence and dread. 'El Orfanato' is definitely one of the latter. I would hesitate to even call 'El Orfanato' a horror movie, but it chilled me to the bone.If you are wanting gore, see you around, guys! You will be happier somewhere else. Other than one small in-your-face moment, there is no gore in this movie. It is much subtler than that.I intend to give nothing away of the plot. You need to let it unfold yourself. 'El Orfanato' is about atmosphere and quiet and dread. The horror of something hidden in the dark. The sound of something on the stairs. The whisper of children's voices, when there are no children present. The chill of something passing close by. The dead. The forgotten. Secrets long buried.I thought that 'El Orfanato' was a genuine, modern, supernatural masterpiece. Really I did. I am a big boy. I don't get scared watching movies, not anymore, but 'El Orfanato', got me holding on tight to the armrest of my seat.Great movie.",9,7,11,16 April 2008
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Entertaining enough, but...
","Hmm... I must admit, I am a bit torn with regard to 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story'.The idea of this movie was fine. A parody biopic covering the career of singer Dewey Cox and detailing his struggles with fame, family and 'interesting substances'. As the film progresses you see his career develop through rock 'n' roll (psycho Elvis!), rockabilly, folk protest (a brilliant and incomprehensible Dylan impersonation), psychedelic pop (the best Brian Wilson/Beach Boys/'Smile' mickey take of all time), cheesy family entertainment and the final unveiling of his musical masterpiece.I liked the spot on musical parodies. I liked the surprising cameos from some very known faces playing musical icons (Elvis, Buddy Holly and the totally priceless meditating with the Beatles section). I liked the extremely game cast - Jenna Fishcher (Where has she been all my life? I don't suppose anybody has got her phone number, have they?), Tim Meadows ('You don't want to try this sh*t!') and the grave and brilliant Raymond J. Barry ('The wrong son died!') All good.But, and it's a big but...'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' just wasn't funny enough. Maybe if a more scatter shot approach had been applied a la 'Airplane', 'Top Secret!' or 'The Naked Gun' (throw a hundred jokes at the screen and some of them will stick), the film might have been funnier? I don't know. As it was I would have to say that I came out thinking that 'Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story' was entertaining enough, but was nothing I would be inclined to stay in to watch on TV again.I got to thinking about John C. Reilly in the lead. He is a fine supporting actor, and a fine character actor, and he certainly tried hard, but he is not a leading man and especially not in a comedy. I came out of the cinema wondering what somebody like Will Ferrell might have done with the role and this is from not the greatest Will Ferrell fan in the world.No fears, 'This Is Spinal Tap'. The greatest parody music flick of all time award still belongs to you.",6,0,0,20 January 2008
Spider-Man," Faithfull adaptation, good performances, but slow
","It has been a good many years since I read a `Spider-Man' comic and I would say that, failing lapses in memory, this was a very faithful adaptation. Yes, there are probably minor points that the hardcore fans would object to - the organic webshooters, Mary Jane Watson's white trash background, the Green Goblin's outfit, the different circumstances that lead to Peter Parker's first meeting with the mugger that would change his life - but these were minor and did not affect the the story.What absolute perfect casting Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were as the leads.  Tobey Maguire  fine actor as we all knew, but I was especially impressed with Willem Dafoe.  Like many people before the film went into production I read that the part of the Green Goblin had been offered to John Malkovich, and I was sad that he eventually decided to turn the part down. Now I would say that I could not imagine any other actor but Willem Dafoe in the role.  He was brilliant.  And as for Kirsten Dunstshe has become a very beautiful and attractive woman, probably the only qualification required for the part of Mary Jane Watson.There are a couple of criticisms.  The special effects were not what they could have been.  Everybody has said that.  Post-production haste?  The film also suffered in exactly the same way as the first Christopher Reeve `Superman' in that it was too slow and too long.  It seemed that there was an awful lot of essential back story to fill in, and the film does fill it all in, and at great length.  But, saying that, now that the back story is out of the way, `Spider-Man 2' looks like it could be a total classic in much the same way that `Superman 2' was a total classic of its kind.And I do hope that Sam Neill does play Dr. Octopus!",5,0,0,13 June 2002
Control," Excellent film. About time I finally got hold of those Joy Division albums
","In 1980 a music legend died.The legend was a man considered by many to be a poet, a visionary and a genius. A man whose band challenged and extended the boundaries of what could be done with popular music. This was a man who, at the time, influenced an entire generation of musicians and whose shadow still hangs large over much of the music produced today.This man's sudden death shocked me deeply. I still think of all of the great music that would never be heard and the full career that would never be.Sorry? What was that again?No. I'm talking about John Lennon. Frankly the death of Ian Curtis meant diddly squat to me at the time. True, I had heard of Joy Division, and I rather liked 'Love With Tear Us Apart', but beyond a general sadness upon hearing of the death of a man at such a young age, Ian Curtis' death didn't touch me at all. I do remember Tony Wilson on the radio, during this time, denying that Joy Division were going to split up because 'the other three guys are really talented musicians and have already started to write new songs'. I remember thinking that that was a little cold and unnecessary, almost as if it didn't matter that Ian Curtis had died. Business as usual.I cannot claim to be the biggest Joy Division aficionado in the world, simply because I still really only know a handful of their songs. My favourites are 'Transmission', 'Atmosphere' and 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'. (The popular ones?) I went to see 'Control' because the snippets of the Joy Division story in the movie '24 Hour Party People' intrigued me and I wanted to know more.In execution 'Control' couldn't have been more different from '24 Hour Party People'. If this had been the 1960's '24 Hour Party People' would have been late 60's, freewheeling, loud, energetic and psychedelic, with 'Control' being early 60's, Alan Sillitoe, kitchen sink, grim, eee-lad-it's-grim-oop-North drama shot in expressionistic and beautiful black and white and probably starring Tom Courteney or Albert Finney.Did I say grim? Not all of it. 'Control' is shot through with a very black Northern humour. Toby Kebbell as legendary Joy Division/New Order manager Rob Gretton is absolutely hilarious, be it berating the abilities of an early Joy Division manager or trying to convince another singer to replace Ian Curtis onstage mid gig. Joe Anderson is also very funny as Peter Hook, especially when trying to wind up Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson - less comical than Steve Coogan, but effective) or expressing his annoyance about name of the punk band the Buzzcocks.Sam Riley has received unqualified plaudits for his performance as the tragic Ian Curtis, and so he should. He was absolutely brilliant. An astonishing physical resemblance to Curtis (much more than Sean Harris in '24 Hour Party People'). He moved like Curtis and sounded liked Curtis. (I don't know if it is true I'm told that the guys playing Joy Division in the film actually played their instruments live. If it is true, good for them. They sounded like a real band.) It might be the performance of his Sam Riley's life. I hope he turns out to be a great actor and impresses in other great films.Outside of the above, 'Control' generally had a great all round cast. Especially Samantha Morton who was great as a kind of innocent Deborah Curtis. Trying to build a life of domesticity for herself, her husband and baby, but losing out to the pressures and temptations of a music business lifestyle and Curtis' inner demons. Fantastic, straightforward and as real a performance as you could hope to see in a modern film.One of the final shots of the film was interesting. The three remaining, grief stricken members of Joy Division sitting (in the pub?) Stephen Morris' girlfriend joins them at the table. She puts her arm around him. The camera lingers on them. The first shot of the fledgling New Order.Excellent film. About time I finally got hold of those Joy Division albums, isn't it?Go and see.",8,3,5,15 October 2007
Enchanted," A Disney movie for people who hate Disney movies
","Oh, my... 'Enchanted' is just fantastic. So good and enchanting (see what I did there?) that when the movie was over I practically floated out of the cinema.Seriously, 'Enchanted' is a really great family movie, and this is from a man who hardly ever watches family movies at the cinema. If you like, 'Enchanted' is a Disney movie for people who hate Disney movies. Comedy for the kids, knowing in-jokes for the adults and a brilliant central performance by Amy Adams as Giselle, cartoon ingenue come to life, all wide eyed innocence and fluttering hand movements. If you see a more game and better comedic performance this year, please let me know, but I doubt if you will. Amy Adams is just wonderful.Great supporting performances from cynical divorce lawyer with a heart of gold, Patrick Dempsey, more square jawed that any man in history, James Marsden, villainous hag and evil witch queen, Susan Sarandon and snivelling henchman, Timothy Spall. Not to forget the comedy chipmunk. Or was it a comedy rat?I think that 'Enchanted' is well worth the trip to your local fleapit.",8,2,3,20 December 2007
Quantum of Solace," Bond filtered via 'The Bourne Ultimatum'
","I have a theory about 'Quantum Of Solace'.Marc Forster, who is a good art house Director ('Finding Neverland', 'Monster's Ball', 'The Kite Runner'), is signed to direct 'Quantum Of Solace'. Forster, who is very adept at directing performance based movies, quickly realises that he has no idea how to direct an action film. So, he researches, checking out some of the most successful action movies of the previous couple of years to get ideas and a feeling for tone, structure and look. Forster, finding his template, starts work.'Quantum Of Solace' is Bond filtered via 'The Bourne Ultimatum'.Now, don't get me wrong. I liked 'Quantum Of Solace' just fine. Maybe it was a little pofaced and one-note throughout, and did not have the variation in plot of 'Casino Royale', but I thought 'Quantum Of Solace' was a good film. It started well and got better as it went along. It just did not feel like a Bond film. It felt like a Bourne film.Scenes of intelligence mandarins tracking the action via high-tech surveillance. Bone crushing, close up, fight sequences. Super fast, adrenalised car chases. Sudden death. Blood. Dirt. Heroes and villains that really get hurt. The mental effect on a person of having to watch a person die. All classic Bourne.Maybe all action films from a particular period do have a particular look and feel to them? I don't know. I will say that 'Quantum Of Solace' does frequently achieve a kind of poetry of violence, especially in the 'Tosca' segment. 'Quantum Of Solace' is refreshingly short, looks great and Daniel Craig is fantastic as the tormented, revenge driven Bond.For me, though, the only truly traditional Bond moment was Bond's brief interlude with foxy Gemma Arterton's posh Agent Fields. Perhaps it was a tiny little hint of what the Daniel Craig/Bond persona might be like when/if he lightens up in future movies. Also, a nice little nod by the filmmakers back to a memorable exit in 'Goldfinger'. (Do you miss the daft names that Fleming used to give his female characters? Check out Agent Fields full name on IMDb. It will make you laugh. I did.)I hope Daniel Craig makes another Bond film, but I hope that next time it is more Bond and less Bourne.",7,1,2,8 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," The Coen's back on form
","Interesting comment overheard in the cinema on Saturday.'No Country For Old Men' had ended and the credits were rolling. I was getting up to leave when I heard a guy, who was sitting a few seats away from me, say sadly to his lady, 'Three quarters of that were great, but that last quarter was really sh*t'.Hmm... Maybe, but only if you want a movie where everything is wrapped up for you in a nice bow and everything is explained. I don't think that the Coen's at full tilt want to give you that at all.That gentleman in the cinema was missing the point. Really missing the point. Up until the last quarter of 'No Country For Old Men' the Coen's are playing within the conventions of the thriller, albeit a beautiful looking, intelligently paced and well acted thriller. (Basically man finds money and another man tries to take the money off him. People die. Mayhem ensues.) During the last quarter of 'No Country For Old Men' the Coens mess with the conventions of the standard thriller. Characters arrive late. Crucial events occur off screen. Life and death conversations take place in rooms. The fate of some of the characters is uncertain. A man thinks about how the world used to be.Maybe. What do I know?With 'No Country For Old Men' the Coen's are back to the kind of form that has evaded them in recent years, with terrible, deliberate crowd pleaser's like 'Intolerable Cruelty' and 'The Ladykillers'. I think that 'No Country For Old Men' is a great movie and that it will win the Oscar for best film in 2008 and the Coen's the Oscar for Best Director(s). Trust me. It's going to happen.",9,1,4,4 February 2008
Mamma Mia!," Big, loud, silly and wonderful
","Here's the thing.There are no vocalists in 'Mamma Mia!' anywhere near as good as the ABBA girls, Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Agnetha Fältskog. The plot of 'Mamma Mia!' is about as broad and complex as an 'American Pie' sequel, with some of the plot contrivances being, frankly, jaw dropping, and most of the acting is at about the level of a decent panto.However...'Mamma Mia!' is brilliant. Really brilliant. Such a crowd pleaser. An exuberant, energetic, sparking musical, full of timeless songs and a cast (step forward Meryl Streep) who attack their roles with true gusto. Big, loud, silly and wonderful. As bright and camp as Graham Norton and Dale Winton on a night out. Look in any dictionary under the phrase 'Feelgood Movie' and you will see 'Mamma Mia!' writ large. They should prescribe 'Mamma Mia!' on the National Health. Fixes all known ills.'Mamma Mia!' is a fantastic movie. I urge you most strongly to go and see it. My lady and I literally skipped out of the cinema. Let me tell you, we were not a pretty sight.",8,6,9,13 July 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Serious, poetic and beautifully shot western
","Simply put, I thought that 'The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford' was a cracking piece of work. Serious, poetic and a beautifully shot western, built on excellent central performances by Brad Pitt as Jesse James and Casey Affleck as Robert Ford respectively.Brad Pitt's Jesse James is hardly an American folk hero. He is a nasty piece of work. Unstable, unpredictable, tormented and ruthless. A dominant personality. People are afraid of Jesse James and rightly so. It is one of the best performances of Pitt's career. Forget Pitt as A-lister and tabloid fodder and think about Pitt as the great character actor that he undoubtedly is.As good as Pitt is, the true revelation here is the performance of Casey Affleck. I have only ever been aware of Affleck as Ben's brother and as the comic relief in 'Ocean's Eleven', 'Ocean's Twelve' and 'Ocean's Thirteen'. There is nothing in those films that could prepare you for his work in 'The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford'. Just outstanding. If he does not get a Supporting Actor nod at the Oscars next month, I will be very much surprised.Casey Affleck's Robert Ford is a slightly creepy, slightly dislikeable man who is trying way too hard. He is very much a small man trying to be a big man and in the process manages to get in way over his head. His initial hero worship of Jesse James turns into something disappointing, destructive and tragic.'The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford' is a great film. Quite a long film, but engrossing throughout. The hours just shot by. It is early days yet, but I think it is my film of the year so far.",9,5,10,19 January 2008
Seabiscuit," Oscar winner for Best Film 2004?
","Oscar winner for Best Film 2004?  Well, maybe.  Some very good things in this film with all of the ingredients of an Oscar winner.  Perhaps, an almost cynical attempt at creating an Oscar winner?Highly regarded actor, who is long overdue for recognition by the academy. Jeff Bridges.  Hot young turk.  Tobey Maguire.  Oscar winner in supporting role.  Chris Cooper.  (All of whom are excellent, by the way).  Story of triumph over adversity; of the little man beating the odds.  An inspirational story.  Unintentionally funny as well.  I especially enjoyed the advice given to the jockey to let Seabiscuit look the opposing horse in the eye and then he would definitely win the race.Where's my academy award?Above and beyond the above, it is a good film and I enjoyed it.  However, if it hadn't been for the fact that it was based on a true story (Hi There! 'A Beautiful Mind') I would say that it was almost a too good to be true Oscar winner.",7,0,0,23 November 2003
The Number 23," Torn on this one
","I'm torn on this one. Exactly 50-50. I did enjoy it, and the first half is great and full of ideas and atmosphere, but then 'The Number 23' gets dafter and dafter, sillier and sillier, and more and more overwrought as it progresses. It's definitely a stew of a film. (That might not be too bad if you like a good stew.) A mix of mathematics, paranoid conspiracy, supernatural, murder mystery and private dick/femme fatale fantasies. I thought it had passing echoes of films like 'Angel Heart' (which I think is a little masterpiece) and 'Conspiracy Theory' (which I don't).I do like Jim Carrey, but I don't know if he was the right actor for the lead in this film. My lady really hates Jim Carrey's gurning, rubber faced, loon roles (her words). Hell, I don't mind the 'Ace Ventura' films or 'Liar, Liar' or 'Me, Myself And Irene' or 'Bruce Almighty' et al, they are what they are. But at his best ('Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind' , 'Man On The Moon' and 'The Truman Show') he can be brilliant.Jim Carrey fan letter over.",5,11,22,7 May 2007
The Lives of Others," It's a masterpiece
","East Germany. 1984. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler (played by Ulrich Mühe) is a stasi agent ordered to monitor a successful playwright Georg Dreyman (played by Sebastian Koch). Wiesler is quiet, methodical, dedicated and professional. He believes in what he is doing. He is also lonely and a man who empty on the inside. As time goes by, the lives of Dreyman and Dreyman's girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (played by Martina Gedeck) start to impact on him and then, in at first very subtle ways, he starts to impact on them.It was the second time I attempted to see 'Leben der Anderen, Das'. The first time the projector broke down with half an hour to go. (To be honest, a crucial half an hour, detailing the dramatic end of the main story, the rise of Gorbachev, the fall of Communism, the reunification of Germany and the reconciliation of Germany's past. Big subjects.) I'm glad I made the effort.'Leben der Anderen, Das' is a great movie. Brilliantly written and acted. A worthy winner of the Foreign Film Oscar this year. Incredibly moving and tragic and thoughtful and startling. My lady was in tears by the end of it. The best movies are movies about people. Very important to understand how true that is.I heard that there is an American remake in the works.Oh, go away... For God's sake...",9,6,9,7 May 2007
Across the Universe," Wonderful
","Here in the UK, 'Across The Universe' has had somewhat of a rough ride from some critics. (Hi there esteemed film reviewers of the 'Independent' and 'Metro' newspapers!) Basically they felt that 'Across The Universe' was just awful; shoehorning the Beatles music into an ill-thought through piece of musical cinema, using those songs in wholly inappropriate and crass ways.I cannot say that I understand their opinion completely. Maybe you just have to be a Beatles fan to appreciate the film, but I thought that 'Across The Universe' was absolutely wonderful.OK... Maybe not absolutely wonderful. Outside of the many great musical set pieces (there are 31 songs on the soundtrack) the film suffers from a somewhat lethargic pacing and a fairly witless and predictable story. Guff about the innocence of the early Sixties being eroded by Vietnam, civil rights, the expanding drug culture, sexual and political revolution is used as a background to a simplistic story of Boy meets Girl, Boy and Girl fall in love, Boy loses Girl, Boy gets Girl back and, hey, guess what? The message here is that 'All You Need Is Love'.You got all that? Good. Forget all of it, because what makes 'Across The Universe' a really good film, and where it really works, is in the stunning visuals (Julie Taymor also made 'Titus', which anybody will tell you is an astonishing looking film) and the brilliant versions of those songs, some of which are over 40 years old.Highlights?T. V. Carpio's version of 'I Want To Hold Your Hand',reinvented as a lesbian torch song. Evan Rachel Wood's exuberant 'It Won't Be Long' (I sadly have to report that I had completely forgotten that brilliant opener to 'With The Beatles'), as a great, lost, call and response, Sixties girl group number. Bono's truly bonkers version of 'I Am The Walrus'. Joe Cocker's muscular take on 'Come Together'. Joe Anderson's 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' (with Salma Hayek popping up a a nurse, oh, yes!) Practically everything sang by Jim Sturgess ('Strawberry Fields Forever', 'Across The Universe', 'Girl') and Dana Fuchs ('Helter Skelter', 'Oh Darling', 'Don't Let Me Down').Er... Basically the highlights were all of the musical sections of the film. True, Eddie Izzard doing 'Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite' was kind of terrible, but I think it was supposed to be terrible.Even if you are not a Beatles fan, and there are some of those curious creatures about (Hi there, Mr. Planet! Hi there, Graham!), there is a lot to enjoy in 'Across The Universe'. But be warned. You are almost certainly going to miss out on some of the fun Beatles references, he says smugly. (A girl climbing in through a bathroom window, anyone? The climatic rooftop gig being interrupted by the police, bringing to mind the last time the Beatles played live, on the roof of Apple headquarters on 30th January 1969.) I think that 'Across The Universe' is worth seeing, but I would say that, being Beatles fan A number 1.Remember... 'All You Need Is Love'.",7,2,5,2 October 2007
The Mist," Wonderful, horrific, twisted and shocking
","Pop quiz. Tell me, what do you consider to be the most successful Stephen King adaptation, made for film or television? 'Carrie'? 'The Dead Zone'? 'Salem's Lot'? 'Stand By Me'? No! Not 'Maximum Overdrive'!! (And if that is your choice, may God forgive you, because I won't.)All of the above, except 'Maximium Overdrive' of course, are great pieces of work. But my choice as the benchmark Stephen King adaptation would probably be 'The Shawshank Redemption', directed by Frank Darabont.Stephen King has been very good for Frank Darabont. 'The Shawshank Redemption' has become a modern classic and 'The Green Mile' was nearly as good. I am glad to say that 'The Mist' is nearly as good again.'The Mist' is a great film, perfectly structured, but a film that requires patience. It is a film of the slow build and of a gradual getting to know the characters, their obsessions, their fears and prejudices. It was nice to see a King horror film where his great talent of touching on the reality of a small town, has been exploited. It makes it all the more horrific when all hell does break loose, because the people who are getting hurt are ones that you know.Thomas Jane is faintly wooden. Personally I would not have cast him, but all of the other performances are top notch. Marcia Gay Harden's possibly psychotic, fundamental Christian, Toby Jones' short, pudgy, perfectly ordinary hero, Andre Braugher's uptight, big city lawyer and William Sadler's scared, malleable blue collar worker. All excellent.'The Mist' is not 'The Shawshank Redemption' in one crucial way. Whereas 'The Shawshank Redemption' was about hope and life, 'The Mist' is about hopelessness and death. One thing that they have in common is an astonishing ending. The ending of 'The Mist' is wonderful, horrific, twisted and shocking. Not anything that I saw coming.'The Mist' is marvellous. Must see.",8,157,237,28 July 2008
I Am Legend," Two thirds of it are absolutely brilliant
","It's quite interesting how the UK reviews of 'I Am Legend' have panned out. The general gist seems to be that most reviewers really liked the first two thirds, but felt that all of the good work was undone by a rushed and unbalanced final third. Broadly I think I would agree with that. The first two thirds of 'I Am Legend' are absolute genius, not only because of the brilliant realisation of an abandoned and devastatingly empty New York City, but because of a truly fine performance by Will Smith as Robert Neville.3 years after a man made disease devastated the human race, Robert Neville is the last man left alive in New York City. He is haunted by dreams of his family, the way the crisis escalated out of control and the responsibility to find a 'fix'. Neville's isolation, depression and slowly building psychosis are a real thing. When night comes, Neville hides away. There is terror and there is dread, because there are things in the dark...'I Am Legend' is a mostly great film, with a consistently great performance by Will Smith. Head and shoulders above what is the norm for a Christmas blockbuster. It is true that the ending dips into pretty predictable, CGI heavy, action heroics, but if you like that kind of thing, you will enjoy it. I just think that the ending somewhat dissipated the paranoid atmosphere built up earlier in the film. I think that the film deserved a better ending. The ending of the book would have been good. A new world born from the old.Who am I kidding? No Hollywood studio would have gone for that ending. Way too bleak.",7,0,2,30 December 2007
The Illusionist," Old fashioned twist-in-the-tale thriller
","The reviews over here have been pretty much up and down on 'The Illusionist' but I must confess I really enjoyed it.Edward Norton is very serious (is he ever anything but serious?), Paul Giamatti is charming and ambiguous, Rufus Sewell is back to his hissable villain best and Jessica Biel gives a performance, rather than just being eye candy. (I never knew she had it in her.) They made the movie happen.Forget any comparisons with 'The Prestige' (a superior film), 'The Illusionist' is really an old fashioned twist in the tale thriller, concerned with slight of hand and fooling the audience. What you think is going on might not be what is going on. It's not completely successful. Maybe I've just seen too many movies, because I guessed what was happening about half way through. However, it didn't spoil it. Sometimes the predictable clockwork plot can be comforting. I'll also say that 'The Illusionist' looks wonderful. All monochrome, browns and greys. Really atmospheric. Horses, gaslight, smoke and mirrors. I love the whole look of Victorian-era set movies.",6,1,1,7 May 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Should have been better
","... Or to give it it's proper title, 'Fantastic Four 2: The Contractual Obligation'.OK. That's very negative. As a superhero movie pitched towards very small children, I suppose that there is nothing wrong with '4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer', but really it should have been so much better. I know that a lot of people didn't like the first 'Fantastic Four' movie very much, but I did (it was big, silly, technicolour fun), and sad to say it, '4: Rise Of The Silver Surfer' is nowhere near as good.The great assets of the first film were Chris Evans, Michael Chiklis and Julian McMahon. The film came alive whenever those actors were on screen. This time round they sleepwalked their way through their roles (I'm sure I saw one of them checking his watch), leaving Ioan Gruffudd and Jessica Alba (very nice to look at, but I hated your hair this time, Darling!) to drown in a plot of bad jokes and semi-romantic mush (both of which I sometimes have a disturbingly high tolerance for, but not this time). The Silver Surfer effects are magnificent, but the least you can expect in a Summer blockbuster are good special effects.Should have been better. Much, much better.",4,1,3,17 July 2007
Transformers," What's that smell?
","This is what happened when we went to see 'Transformers'.We bought tickets and went into the cinema. The adverts came and went, so did the trailers. The lights went down and the film started. It was then that I noticed the smell. I looked around. I sniffed here and there. Couldn't place it. I looked at my Girlfriend. Had she broken wind? No. I sniffed some more. The smell was getting worse. Then it dawned on me. The smell was coming from the screen!I thought 'Transformers' was absolutely awful.Maybe it's me. My Brother (37 years old) has seen it twice. He loved it. My Nephew (11 years old) has seen it twice. He loved it. Two male work colleagues (21 and 30 years old respectively) say that they loved it. A female work colleague (26 years old, blonde, nice figure, likes to lick her lips, cheeky smile...) thought that it was 'not bad'.What do they know? They know nothing.If you are into a whole military hardware, scientific geek fest celebration, then there are things to enjoy in 'Transformers' (some of the military hardware sequences are great), but there is also really, really bad and predictable comedy featuring, a geek on whom the whole future of the human race depends (who you just know is going to get the hot girl despite the fact that she seems to have been dipped for hours in perma-tan), comedy parents, comedy black ops operatives (John Turturro hold your head in shame), irritating Jar Jar Binks style robots (Bumblebee and the other villainous little robot, all squeeks and R2D2isms) and a greatest-hacker-in-the-world (Tm) who is an overexcited, fat, black dude who eats too much. Give me strength...I'm also starting to suspect that for a (generally considered by some?) top action Director, Michael Bay has no idea how to direct a coherent action sequence. 'Transformers' suffered from exactly the same too close approach that ruined action sequences in 'Armageddon' and 'The Island'. Too much happening and it was happening too fast. For God's sake, Michael, pull back and let the audience see what is going on. You don't have to be right in the middle of it all of the time.I never watched the original series. Should I have done? I feel that I've missed out on something.By the way, my Girlfriend liked 'Transformers' a lot. She said that it was a fine, Summer movie. (Fume. Snarl. Growl. Spits in disgust.)",3,17,28,13 August 2007
Mulholland Drive," A masterpiece
","This was David Lynch's masterpiece.  An astonishing piece of work, pierced together from an abandoned TV series pilot.  It does make sense; but not on first viewing.  Watch it several times, and the threads start to knit together.  Marvel at the humour, the strangeness, the cruelty, the drama, the jealously and the performances, always the performances.Was Naomi Watts robbed of the Oscar for best actress for this film?  Er, we will think about that for a microsecond.  Yes, she was.  Was there a better female performance in a film released that year?  Er, no, there wasn't.There was not a bad performance by anybody in the film.  Justin Theroux. Fantastic.  Laura Harring.  Fantastic.Time to check out 'Lost Highway' again, methinks.",9,6,10,23 November 2003
Black Snake Moan," Less salacious than you might think
","How's this for a precis of a movie? Ageing blues man Samuel L. Jackson endeavours to cure sexpot Christina Ricci of her nymphomania, by chaining her to his radiator.There was no way that I could miss that film, and I didn't.'Black Snake Moan' is actually really good. Although it is true to say that there are a fair bit of Ms. Ricci's assets on show, 'Black Snake Moan' is more than just a latter day exploitation movie. It is a lot less salacious and a lot more thoughtful than you might imagine. Some interesting points made about childhood sexual abuse leading the sexual dysfunction in later life, and the way that the surface image of a person is not necessarily the true image.Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson both act their socks off, but I doubt that either of them will be nominated for anything for 'Black Snake Moan'. Shame. Good performance as well by Justin Timberlake as Christina Ricci's absent boyfriend. The only man who can keep her under control, but also a man with issues of his own.Interesting film.",7,4,8,28 May 2007
The Dark Knight," Not perfect, but a really good, high octane action film
","'The Dark Knight' has been the cinema sensation of 2008. It has been, very nearly, universally acclaimed by the critics. It is the biggest film of the year so far, by far, and is unlikely to be overtaken by anything else released during 2008. For weeks 'The Dark Knight' was the #1 film on IMDb's top 250 films list (which surprised me a little bit, as it was a very new film), although it is down to #3 this week. It has endured unprecedented levels of hype and has come through unhindered as a big, solid hit movie. A perfect Summer blockbuster.I don't think that 'The Dark Knight' is a perfect film, but it is a really good film, if not a great film. Certainly it is the best high octane, high weaponry action film released in many a year (for high octane, high weaponry, I think 'Heat' or 'Die Hard') and would still have worked even if it had not been a Batman movie. It has great set pieces, a huge scale (I saw it on an IMAX screen - Good Lord! - highly recommended) and had good performances by the whole cast, but especially by Heath Ledger, Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart. Particularly Aaron Eckhart. He had the most difficult character arc to follow during the course of the film.I said that 'The Dark Knight' is not a perfect film. It isn't. Let me elaborate.1. It is too long. Sorry, but it is. Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. The first half of the film could have definitely been trimmed.2. Bale's Batman voice sometimes verged on the ridiculous. I kept thinking of The Kurgan from 'Highlander'.3. Michael Caine's screen time as Alfred was little more than an extended cameo. I seem to remember he had more screen time in 'Batman Begins'.4. Ditto Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox.5. Maggie Gylenhaal's Rachel Dawes really had nothing to do. True, I will admit that her final scenes were crucial to the motivation of Harvey Dent in the latter part of the movie.6. Unlike in 'Batman Begins', this time around Batman/Bruce Wayne was not nearly as interesting as the villains. The typical curse of any Batman film.I am being picky. Sure I am. Minor issues.I really enjoyed 'The Dark Knight'. I definitely recommend it, even if you cannot stand superhero movies.",8,1,7,15 August 2008
Blood Diamond," It's OK, but not great
","I was hoping for another powerful African set film like 'The Constant Gardener', but 'Blood Diamond' is not as good as that, or as affecting or as emotionally resonant.I'll grant you that 'Blood Diamond' does have it's moments. It looks wonderful (all burnt browns and oranges) and Djimon Hounsou is truly terrific and gives a very powerful and convincing performance. His Oscar nomination was well deserved. DiCaprio is OK, but I didn't really believe him as an ex mercenary and Jennifer Connolly, as gorgeous as she still is (hello Mr. Shallow), didn't have nearly enough to do.Such a shame. It should have been great.",4,5,12,7 May 2007
Mission: Impossible," Disgraceful, drivel, terrible (spoilers)
","This was a Tom Cruise spy film.  Unfortunately it was not a 'Mission: Impossible' film, and that was my problem.The overall most important element of the TV series was the plot - the heist, the robbery, the fraud, the trickery, the whatever...  The team (the brain, the girl, the technician, the muscle and the actor) in effect were only there to move the plot forward.  But, saying that, we really got to know and trust these anonymous agents; a tribute to such  excellent actors as Peter Graves, Martin Landau and Leonard Nimoy.  The first thing that this film does is kill off the team.  Disgraceful!  And then various members of the new team he puts together turn out to be traitors.  Drivel!  And then at the end of the film they completely trash the reputation of TV's greatest spy master Jim Phelps.  Terrible!  Sorry, but this is not the film that I wanted to see.It says a lot that according to rumour the producers did not see fit to offer any of the original cast members of 'Mission: Impossible' so much as even a silent cameo in this movie.  (Imagine the great Martin Landau as the aged Rollin' Hand.  What a missed opportunity).  I think another case of buying a title and doing what you like with it.  See 'The Saint' for further details.",2,10,16,24 June 2001
The Happening," A good idea, but not allied to a strong story.
","Out of the films that M. Night Shyamalan has made that I have seen, 'The Happening' is definitely the worst.The dialogue is terrible. The acting is variable. (The worst culprit is sexy Zooey Deschanel, who is wide eyed and, actually, kind of dreadful. Also, no matter how good he has been in other movies, Mark Wahlberg is just not a high school science teacher. Think how good somebody like Tim Robbins or Jeff Goldblum might have been in the same role.) The plot meanders about, going nowhere in particular, and at no particular speed. It is true: 'The Happening' is a disappointment. For M. Night Shyamalan the halcyon days of 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' seem a long, long time ago. (Can I admit at this point that I have liked all of his films, including 'Lady In The Water'? Credibility blown, methinks!)However...M. Night Shyamalan is still a genius. (Yes he is, and I will get my Brother to fight anybody who disagrees with me.) Even a minor entry in his oeuvre is a little bit special and something to be savoured. There is not a Director today (OK, maybe David Lynch) who can match him for generating a mood of dread, disquiet and other worldliness. There are moments in 'The Happening' where you literally hold your breath as you wonder what is going to happen next: The start and end sequences, the final moments of Betty Buckley and John Leguizamo's characters, the conversation with the railway staff, the wind moving through the trees...'The Happening' has a good central idea and is an unashamed environmentally aware movie, made at a time where every Tom, Dick, Harry and automobile corporation is jumping on the Green bandwagon. It imagines a logical conclusion of the Gaia Hypothesis: If the Earth is a single organism, and is being threatened, what would happen if the Earth tried to defend itself against the aggressor?It is a good idea, but sadly, 'The Happening' has not allied it to a strong story. Such a shame, but M. Night Shyamalan will be back. Do not doubt it. He is a true original and we need more true originals.",5,1,5,16 June 2008
The Fountain," A masterpiece
","It wouldn't be wrong to say that here in the UK 'The Fountain' has had mixed reviews.The Bad. The Metro called it a 'spectacular mess'. The Independent called it a 'towering, tumultuous folly'.The Good. Empire Online called it a 'complex and gorgeous mini-epic'. Everybody on IMDb, who's bothered to review it, thinks that it's one of the greatest films ever made.I'm with the latter bunch. I thought that even in it's compromised form (there is a bit later about what 'The Fountain' could have been), it was just wonderful. Absolutely fantastic. I was speechless at the end. (This has been a very difficult film to write about. I have started this pitiful review several times.) Forget the nonsense about this being a science fiction film about the search for the Tree Of Life. It's like saying that Soderbergh's 'Solaris' (another film I really loved) is about George Clooney meeting aliens in outer space. 'The Fountain' is way more than just a science fiction film. It's a beautiful and ambiguous meditation on life and death. Specifically it's about the all encompassing obsession, anger and frustration of a man unable and unwilling to accept the death of his wife and his eventual journey to acceptance and peace. It's easily the best performance, by a country mile, that Hugh Jackman has ever given. He should have been Oscar nominated. It's a scandal that he has been ignored.'The Fountain' has had a troubled genesis.It was supposed to have gone into production in 2002, with Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in the lead roles, but Pitt bailed days before the $70 million production was due to begin, citing that great old standby 'creative differences' with Director Darren Aronofsky. Aronofsky went on to work on several other projects (a 'Batman: Year One' film, that to be honest sounded fascinating because it would have been a realistic and gritty take on the Batman story, with much of the familiar back story jettisoned, and 'Watchmen'), none of which made the screen, before securing a much reduced $35 million budget to crack on with 'The Fountain' It meant a compromised movie. Less on special effects, huge sets and set pieces.'The Fountain' was probably never going to be a huge financial success. It is an art film. It was booed at the Venice Film Festival (which was strange) and it died on it's release at the box office in the States. It is way too strange and obscure and good for the multiplex audience.",8,1,2,7 May 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," A great, big, fat masterpiece
","Is there anything actually left to write about 'It's A Wonderful Life' that hasn't already been written? Forget all about it being the greatest Christmas film of all time ('The Wizard Of Oz' is also a great film, but it is not really a Christmas film), 'It's A Wonderful Life' is actually one of the greatest films of all time, full stop.Simply put, the film revolves around the life of a kind and caring, but frustrated man, who one night during the worst crisis of his life, is shown what the world would have been like if had he never been born. Funnily enough, the whole 'alternative reality' section of the movie takes up less than a quarter of the running time towards the end of the film, although it is always the thing that is mentioned when discussing the film. Prior to that plot turn we are treated to a master class in film acting from the genius that was James Stewart, running from goofy comedy, shyness, happiness, disappointment, frustration, despair and then the blackest dark night of the soul. It is one of the greatest performances in cinema history and I will fight anybody who disagrees with me.In the packed cinema on Saturday I sat near a young woman who had obviously never seen 'It's A Wonderful Life' before. Every now and again I picked up on her reactions to what was going on in the movie. Laughter, gasps and then, of course, tears. She was still wiping her eyes when the lights came up. Actually, so was I.'It's A Wonderful Life' is a great, big, fat masterpiece and everybody should see it.",9,1,5,25 December 2007
The Holiday," Way too coy, cloying, cute, sweet and predictable
","Didn't like it. Not one little bit. Way too coy, cloying, cute, sweet and predictable. The whole thing was slightly annoying and queasy. The American Girl character was awful. The British guy character was a sap and self consciously a nice man. Kate's part was OK and so was the part of the American Guy, but neither of them were particularly exciting or memorable characters. There were lots of things wrong with the script.It was also badly researched. I'll give you an example. There was a scene when the American Girl character is in the UK and is watching a trailer that she made for an action film. (The American Girl character's job is as a film trailer maker.) Voice-over Man is giving it some welly and ends with the very deep and gruff proclamation, 'Christmas Day', which I suppose was when the film is supposed to be coming out. No. Wrong. In the UK the cinemas are closed on Christmas Day. As far as I am aware this has always been the case. e.g. No films open here on Christmas Day. Family films often open on Boxing Day, but not on Christmas Day. Somebody should have picked up on that.'The Holiday' wasn't very good, for all of the reasons I mention above. I had hoped that Jack Black might give the American Guy character a bit of oomph, but sadly not. He seemed to be acting on tranquilisers. They should have let Jack Black play Jack Black. Jack Black is very good at playing Jack Black. Nice Dustin Hoffman joke, though.",4,1,4,9 May 2007
30 Days of Night," Not what it could have been
","Barrow, Alaska. The most Northerly town in the United States. During the longest night of the year (er... that would be the '30 days of night' of the title) a group of vampires descend on the town, feeding on everyone that they can find. A group of people, led by an young sheriff, fight to survive the onslaught. Will these people make it until daybreak? Ah... Well that is the question. You will have to see the movie to find out, won't you?Frankly, I think the above setup for a horror movie is absolutely fantastic and brilliant and original (until somebody tells me that it has been done before) and I was really looking forward to seeing it. Plenty of scope for an full blooded 'Dawn Of The Dead' battle-for-survival-against-incredible-odds, kind of a movie. It is such a shame that the execution of the idea left so much to be desired.Yes, the vampires are truly fantastic creations. Evil, gross, vicious, animal like mutations. Danny Huston, as their (Hungarian speaking?) almost philosophical leader, is great and made me shiver every time he appeared on screen. There is wonderful cinematography, in the latter stages focusing on the white of the snow and the red of the blood, and some brilliant scene construction, showing at a distance the carnage and mayhem on the ground. But, sadly and possibly inevitably, '30 Days Of Night' commits the cardinal sin of any horror movie. When the monsters' are not on screen, it is really boring and slow.Maybe it is down to the cast. I don't know. I didn't find them interesting. 'Hard Candy' proves that David Slade can direct a pacy, interesting film with a minimal cast, when that cast is good. (That film is practically a two hander throughout.) I must say that even as a longstanding Josh Harnett apologist (I like him, really I do), I felt that his performance this time is particularly vacant and definitely nothing to write home about.'30 Days Of Night' is not terrible, but it is not what it could have been.",5,2,5,11 November 2007
August Rush," One to avoid if you are of a cynical bent
","Young Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is the result of a one night stand between wannabe rock star Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and talented cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell). Evan has been brought up in an orphanage and has never known his parents, but he has a dream that one day, if they get to hear his music, they will come to him...I rather enjoyed 'August Rush' for it's (yes) fine music and good performances, including an extended, quite dark and sinister faginesque cameo by Robin Williams, an actor hardly known for his restraint on the big screen. 'August Rush' is a definitely a fantasy, a mood piece, as insubstantial as tissue paper and definitely one to avoid if you are of a cynical bent.As enjoyable as it is, I am not at all sure if 'August Rush' will find an audience (although it did run for two weeks at that bastion of the blockbuster, the Cineworld multiplex on Broad Street in Birmingham), being too sentimental and dippy for an adult audience and too self consciously poetic and slow for a young audience.Who cares? I liked it.",7,0,3,8 December 2007
The Reader," Passionate, thoughtful and moving, but there was a problem...
","I enjoyed 'The Reader'. I did. I thought it was a good film. A passionate, thoughtful and moving piece of work about guilt, shame and the secrets that can blight a life. In the first half Kate Winslet and David Kross carried the film, and both were very good, but when Ralph Fiennes took centre stage, 'The Reader' became outstanding. 'The Reader' was a solid and quality piece of work.My problem? Er... Well, the nudity. Kate's copious nakedness was really kind of distracting and 'The Reader' didn't need it. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it took something away from the power of the movie. Perhaps the filmmakers thought they had to demonstrate, in a blatant and provocative way, the passion and the intensity of the affair between the older woman and the younger boy? I don't know. I just felt that the explicitness was draining and a little bit unnecessary.Come on guys (and gals)! There are other ways to shoot love scenes. You can concentrate on the legs, the arms, the back, the lips, the feet, the face. Especially the face. You don't need to show everything.I am not a prude. If Kate Winslet still wants to take her clothes off on screen, then that is just great. In fact, it is fantastic! More power to her elbow. At 33 she is still a fine looking woman. I even promise to only slightly smile when she comes out with the standard spiel about the nudity being 'essential to the plot'.But be honest. The nudity was not essential to 'The Reader', now, was it?",7,2,5,12 January 2009
Music and Lyrics," Entertaining
","There was a perverse reason for seeing this film. Most of my write ups of the films I've seen this year have been, in the main, quite positive. I wanted to see something that had a better than average chance of being dreadful. Perspective required and all that.Guess what? 'Music And Lyrics' isn't dreadful. In fact I would go so far as to say that it is a great and entertaining movie and totally hit the spot for me this weekend when I needed to laugh.Yes, it is 20 minutes too long and yes, Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore hardly stretch themselves and can do this kind of stuff in their sleep and yes, it is predictable in the extreme, but it is very funny, Hugh is charming and Drew is gorgeous (I have had long discussions with a certain guy who thinks that Drew is not gorgeous and is actually deformed, but he is obviously is an idiot, because Drew is gorgeous and I will come after anybody who disagrees with me with a gun). There is also a spot on spoof of an 80's pop video for a song 'Pop Goes My Heart', at the beginning and end of the movie, and that song will stick in your head for hours afterwards. They should release it. It would be a hit.",7,1,2,7 May 2007
Iron Man," Relentless firepower for boys and girls of all ages
","A few years ago, after the debacle that was the 'Batman And Robin' movie, there was a lot of discussion about who should be the next actor to portray Batman. It was considered by many that George Clooney came up short in many ways and fatally contributed to the negative feeling about that movie. (Not an opinion shared by me, by the way, but my feelings on 'Batman And Robin' has changed a lot in the years since it's release. A discussion for another time.)Who should it be? Clint Eastwood in an adaptation of 'The Dark Knight Returns'? Keanu Reeves in a movie directed by the Wachowski Brothers? Kurt Russell? Brad Pitt? All of those names were mentioned.I remember commenting to my Brother that they should go with somebody like Robert Downey Jnr. Laugh? I thought he would never stop.Robert Downey Jnr??? A man who had been arrested several times for drug related offences. A man who had snorted his talent up his nose. A man dropped from a prime slot in a Woody Allen movie, because the insurance company refused to insure him. A man whose career was effectively over, barring cameos in television series' and the odd movie gig.Yes, I said. Robert Downey Jnr. A really good actor, when his mojo is on. A man who had lived duality. A man who could portray the irresponsible playboy Bruce Wayne, but also the darkness required for a serious Batman?Of course history shows that it did not happen, but I was not too unhappy. 'Batman Begins' was a killer movie, Christian Bale was great and I don't think that Robert Downey Jnr. playing Batman would have made it any better or any worse.This brings me to 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jnr. playing an irresponsible playboy and a vengeful, costumed superhero. (I still have my crystal ball, and am available for readings, if anybody is interested.)Robert Downey Jnr. makes 'Iron Man'. He really does. 'Iron Man' would not have been half good without him. He is funny, sarcastic, sexy and charismatic, and just about dominates every scene that he is in, whether in costume or not. I read one comment that said 'Iron Man' would have been just as good if it had been called 'Tony Stark' and Iron Man had never made an appearance at all. I don't think that I would disagree with a word of that. If I had to make a small criticism I would say that Robert Downey Jnr. is so good, he diminishes everybody else on screen at the same time as him, and these people are certainly not chopped liver. (Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Terence Howard.)I thought that 'Iron Man' was a great film. Action packed and fast moving. A big, bright powerhouse of a movie. Everything a hardware obsessed superhero movie should be. Relentless firepower for boys and girls of all ages. I liked the pointed subtext about science being corrupted by the military. Technology can be used for good or bad, a theme faced by Albert Einstein in real life and Tony Stark in 'Iron Man'.Bring on 'Iron Man 2'. I can hardly wait.",8,2,4,16 May 2008
Casino Royale," Sublime
","It's the ridiculous to the sublime. The ridiculous being the piece of horribleness that was 'Die Another Day'. 'Casino Royale' is a sublime movie. Exactly what a Bond film is supposed to be like in the 21st century.It's a magnificent piece of work. As tough as hell. Hard, modern, particularly uncompromising (that torture scene - eek!), action all the way, with an emotional centre, and the perfect way to take the series forward. I particularly liked the way that Bond became Bond during the movie, picking up the various elements that we have become familiar with over the years (the license to kill, the Aston Martin, the tuxedo and finally that iconic catchphrase.) I have said it before. Daniel Craig wouldn't have been my first choice as the new Bond. I would have gone for somebody like Gerard Butler. But with one small reservation, Daniel Craig is great as Bond. Really fabulous. He looks like a boxer who has lost a couple of fights (you can see it in his face), but a man you would hesitate to mess with and would not expect to beat in hand to hand combat ever again. A thug with a veneer of sophistication. (Is that the literary Bond? I don't know. It must be 20 years since I read a Bond novel.) It's a great acting performance by Daniel Craig, which let's be honest is not something that normally matters in the lead role in a Bond film.A while ago I wrote that I was worried a massive departure from the girls, guns, gadgets, villains and action Bond formula would alienate the fans of the movie Bond as opposed to the literary Bond. 'Casino Royale' is not that massive a departure. There are no gadgets as such, but everything else mentioned above is present. (Eva Green as Vesper Lynd? Oh, yes. Tasty enough to spread on toast and eat.) It's a shame there was no time to introduce a new Q or a Moneypenny. I would have liked to have seen new actors playing those characters, even in very short scenes, but no doubt they will appear in the next film. (And the next film already looks as thought it could be quite intriguing, doesn't it? Who wants to bet that the shadowy organisation at the heart of 'Casino Royale' is actually Spectre and that the head of that organisation is actually Ernst Stavos Blofeld?)A criticism. Er... I didn't like the theme song, that much. OK. I suppose it was alright, but 'Casino Royale' needed a ballad and it needed a Bassey, not soft rock. Also, that reservation about Daniel Craig that I mentioned earlier? It's that Daniel Craig comes across more as a fighter than a lover. I didn't really believe him in any of the love scenes.",7,0,3,9 May 2007
300," Loved it
","Maybe this says more about me than it does the movie, but I left the '300' wanting to fight somebody. Preferably after having grown a beard, stripped to the waist, found some funky head gear, a six pack and a sword. I imagined myself rampaging down Broad Street, giving forth my best battle cry to the Saturday afternoon shoppers and Birmingham City Football Club fans.They should show '300' to the England Football team before every game. We would be World Champions, no problem.I loved '300'. Of course the script is utter nonsense (it's all fascist Gung-Ho, Fight-To-The-Death, Never-Retreat-Never-Surrender, Fight-Them-On-The-Beaches-For-God-And-Country portentousness), but the action is thrilling and the cinematography is just beautiful. Absolutely stunning. '300' uses the same techniques of live actors against hyper-realistic backgrounds that was used so successfully in 'Sin City', and it works just as well.Wonderful film.",7,34,68,7 May 2007
Donnie Darko," Citizens of the British Isles! See this film now.
","To be absolutely honest here, I will not pretend that I have completely got the ending of this movie yet, but it hardly matters.  When I eventually purchase the DVD (and I will) I will have plenty of time to consider, judge, ascertain, puzzle over, screw my brow and check out exactly what was going on.  The IMDB boards for `Donnie Darko' also look fascinating.  All I will to say at this juncture is `What a wonderful film'.A fantastic, brilliant piece of filmmaking.  David Lynch channelled through John Hughes, and all credit to the person who linked those two gentlemen in my mind in their previous post about `Donnie Darko'.  Fabulous.  Dazzling ideas aplenty.  Marvellous.  Puts to shame the drivel that Hollywood foists on us from a great height on a daily basis.How old is Richard Kelly?  He is 27 at this writing.  Jesus!  I literally cannot wait until his next film.  Imagine the film's this guy might make as an even more mature filmmaker.Citizens of the British Isles!

Atonement," Pure poetry on film
","My brain tends to turn to mush in the presence of greatness. This makes it difficult when I want to write about something that I thought was truly great. It is so much easier to write about something that is rubbish.Oh, well. Here goes.I thought that 'Atonement' was terrific. It is a really great movie. Obviously it is early days yet, and there are a lot of contenders still to appear, but 'Atonement' might just be the winner-in-waiting of the Best Film Oscar in 2008. Put your money on it now.'Atonement' is pure poetry on film. From the hazy, dreamy, hopeful days of 1935, a destructive act of spite, the horrors of Dunkirk (with one of the most fantastic long takes I have seen in a cinema for a very long), to the aftermath and a devastating 'happy' ending, it is a magnificent and moving film, beautifully directed by Joe Wright.I have never really rated Keira Knightley or understood her popularity. Except for her role in 'Pride & Prejudice' (for which she was perfectly cast) I have tended to refer to her as Girl-Who-Would-Be-Winslet, as I thought that she had not played a single role that Kate Winslet could not have done better. Maybe I won't say that anymore. 'Atonement' is easily the best thing Keira Knightley has done.Keira Knightley has had a lot of the press over here, but we should not forget to mention the pitch perfect performances from James McAvoy and Romola Garai. They share as much screen time as La Knightley and are as impressive.Wonderful film.Gushing over.",9,336,478,10 September 2007
