The Blair Witch Project," sick to my stomach...from bad camera work
","i'm not sure about you guys,  but i prefer to come out of a movie like this atleast a bit disturbed or scared.  Well,  i came out of this movie with a headache and sick to my stomach....due to the film shot without a tripod and constanty panning around.  The movie didn't scare me at all, probably since i knew that it was all set up,  and not actually a true story,  like they passed it off to be.  Even if you didn't read about the making of the movie, about halfway into the movie,  you can realize it wasn't a true story.  One of the worst movies i've ever seen,  and the first movie i wanted to end sooner.",1,1,3,31 July 1999
