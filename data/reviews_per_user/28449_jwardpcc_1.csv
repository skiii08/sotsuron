First Man," Made me violently ill
","I really wanted to like this movie. But the up-close camera that is constantly in motion made me nauseous in the first 10 minutes of the movie. I can understand it for the action scenes. But why when people are talking? The camera is so close up that you could count Peoples nose hairs, if only the camera would hold still for even a second. I had a bad headache half an hour in the movie. I finally had to go throw up in my popcorn bucket. Never saw the end. It looked more technically accurate than Apollo 13, but the camera work is just plain awful. Don't go see this if you have a weak stomach. It's like Blair Witch meets The Right Stuff. And not in a good way.",2,77,144,16 October 2018
