The Blair Witch Project," Get lost!
","This is a boring film about getting lost in a forest. It pretends to be a horror movie but it isn't. It isn't scary unless you are one of those people who watch Scooby Doo from behind the settee. Perhaps the only people who will enjoy it are bulimics, since they can now vomit without putting their fingers down their throats.",1,6,12,6 July 2001
Vertigo," Slow-moving and entirely predictable
",I saw this film for the first time in July 2000. In this era it seems so slow-moving and yawn-provoking. I worked out the entire plot including the ending after 15 minutes of the film (which lasts around 2 hours). For the rest of the time I just waited for the film to catch up. I'm not a genius - the film is just so predictable and cannot for one moment be called 'a suspense thriller'.,5,8,22,12 July 2000
