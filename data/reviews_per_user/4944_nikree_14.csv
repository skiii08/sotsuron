The Lobster," I don't know what to say
","Just like 'The Maze Runner', but more odd.
I mean, if you like out-of-the-blue creativity without any logic. It is exactly it. Absurd reality with strange laws.But make no mistake, a well made movie, I guess, of whatever they were 'trying' seems they succeeded in it.At best, I can get that the movie is a commentary on 'compromise' we do in love and relationship, the lies we say and betrayl to make things work.So called 'matched couple'.",6,1,1,4 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Definitely 10, but there exist Vol. 1
","Less of action compared to Vol 1 and quiet more of story. Don't know if it's a good thing or a bad, depends how you take it.",9,0,0,1 May 2020
Ali," Less movie, more documentary
","No glorification of protagonist, seems like sheer facts are enshrined.
Maybe not a interesting watch, but definitely a knowledgeable one.
One can judge all he wants, movie is not trying to prove 'anything', not even that he's 'great'.",8,0,0,11 March 2020
Casablanca," Definition of 'timeless'
","These are the movies you can watch, regardless of your nationality or generation.It so often happens that, movies come with the bagga gee of their timeline they're made in. But not this.",10,0,0,11 May 2020
12 Angry Men," One of the 'greatest'
","It's no exaggeration. It is one of the classic movies for 'screeplay' or script writers.
As an aspiring one, I wonder I could ever reach near that.",10,1,1,1 May 2020
Begin Again," Movie with no bad guys
","It's jus a happy couple/family movie for Christmas or so.Well made, light-hearted.
Jus don't take the movie for anything it is not.
Well made.",9,0,0,10 April 2020
Lost in Translation," Why there is a dinosaurs in poster
","*Two hopeless people doing random errand.*
And none of them are any way decisively leading anywhere. You can watch first and last 5 minutes, and won't miss a dime.
-Movie lacks goal, throughout I couldn't see where it's going.
-At times felt like dragging.
-Japan shown in kind of negative light.
-It was unnecessary to show female protagonist in seducive light on bed.It's not that the new country is depressing, but YOU Are. New is the door to endless possibility.
But of all those things you gotta find the first girl you get and do the most primitive thing- 'cheat'. From the start it was cheat, cuz you didn't tell that to your spouses. Maybe they don't care enough, still not the point.'You first talk-it-out with your partners, solution is always intrinsic.' (Enlightened reviewer)Not jus go outside and do goofing around because of your 'lack of emotional intelligence and healthy relationship skill'.",5,0,4,13 May 2020
American Beauty," Poof!
","I hate psychotic psychological moviesBut something about this movie, is very funny, interesting, entertaining and I don't know, watchable.I watched it to hate it, but..Psychotic characters-*Main character- is lethargic of life and starts attracting towards her daughter's friend*Her daughter- is insecure of hefself*Her wife- is insecure of her capabilities, and desperate of being successful*Daughter's friend- doesn't want to be ordinary but special*Daughter's lover- who records mundane things and creepy*Lover's father- homophobic, deciplinary*Lover's mother- tamed by his fatherAll have serious issues.",9,0,0,27 May 2020
Spirited Away," Perfect Anime, I guess
","Some reviewer said it right- like, Alice in wonderland. Though the first half is a little tough to digest for me.But later the story started knitting into a well made animation.A regular anime viewer won't have any issues regarding believability, I guess.However, the central part of the movie is innocence and love without any ill-will or harm, which is portrayed well I belief.",8,1,1,7 April 2020
Revolutionary Road," another 'Marriage Story'
","A melodrama of marriage, where a couple fighting for their own piece of mind.
Acting is commendabe, Well made movie.",7,0,0,24 April 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Beautiful
",Quienten is just love. I do not know any other director or movie that is so phenomenally entertaining than this. Brilliant action and great direction with best female protagonist.,10,0,0,29 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Definitely Overrated
","Definitely overratedAlthough I do not like sci-fi (trust me this is one).
Well made movie I guess, for those whose taste it is of.Only complain is the epilogue, which could be taken as an opportunity to relive the same spark again and again by science.
But fortunately the movie throughout defended well-enough how disastrous the process is.One loophole- how did the girl knew where to meet, cuz the plan had been suggested in boy's brain.",7,0,0,11 April 2020
Love Actually," TOOMUCH
","A chotic movie with at least two-dozen-characters. Somehow the movie pulled it off, not sure if successfully. It's important that in a movie every person is valuable and effectively, but with so many, I despised more than half.It's around 150 minutes long. Everyone is having some angle with love, even affair or whatever. And it crosses the line of a Christmas movie when it becomes a fairy at multiple points.You can only be unrealistic for so long.At conclusion it's not worth the 20% time of the day (minus the sleep and chores).",6,0,1,13 May 2020
Jojo Rabbit," You decide.
","Too funny to be art.
Much social-commentary for comedy.Lighthearted. Deep. Emotional. Historical. Lovable.And Everything else, except sexy.
Well there's Scarlett Johansson as well.",10,1,4,6 May 2020
