Captain Phillips," From the Pirates of the Caribbean to the real world.
","Paul Greengrass new film welcomes us into the lives of two different characters with one common purpose, that is survivor. A responsible and decent captain of an American cargo ship and a poor pirate from Somalia. Their journey begins when these two men meet. Captain Philips becomes a hostage from a group of pirates with their goal to take him to Somalia in order to receive a huge ransom. A true story, a powerful thriller personal, political and moral tensions, a stocky protagonist gives recitals interpretation. The big question is who's site are you with. Both characters struggle for their own lives. On Captain Philip's site to keep his family financial satisfy. On the other hand a pirate following orders to hijack cargo ships with weapons and earn a small amount of money so he can feed his own family. Its a thin red line between both sites. It is obvious who wins at the end. And its always the powerful and the 'good' in circumstances like this. Excellent direction by Paul Greengrass with a documentary-like shooting, an absolutely realistic atmosphere than will take your breath away. In my opinion this is Tom Hanks best performance since Cast Away, and probably the best film of 2013.",8,1,2,29 December 2013
Lost in Translation," New, Pure, Perfect!
","How can I describe a perfect and pure film? A middle-aged male actor meets a young graduate girl. Despite the age difference, these two characters share two common things. They are both Lost and suffer from insomnia. The man is questioning him self on family happiness, she's undecided on her choices in her life. Things change when they both meet and bond at a five star hotel in the middle of an 'alien' city, Tokyo. A short journey allowed them to escape from their daily routine and misery. A story so simple with a fantastic atmosphere that will even make the viewer feel alienated or part of it. An original script that its simplicity and elegance makes it powerful and enjoyable. Through the film a soft and original music entangled with the commercial bright signs of the streets of Tokyo makes it even more unique. Two Americans in a place with a completely different mentality will make them come closer and discreetly flirt with each other.A movie that is not for everyone that's for sure. Most people might describe it as boring and pretentious. In my opinion this is one of the best films ever made and the reason is because of its originality and the fact that is ahead of its time. Great acting performance from Billy Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Sofia Coppola did an amazing job by writing and directing this masterpiece.",10,0,0,2 January 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Great Gatsby of the 90's
","The Great Gatsby of the 90's. The autobiography of Jordan Belfort and his extravagant lifestyle with drugs, parties, beautiful companions a whole New Money environment. A colorful film with brilliant acting performances by Leonardo DiCaprio Jonah Hill and Matthew McConaughey. A story of how fraud becomes a strong tool of power and wealth. Scorsese has shown us few times before his admiration of wealthy, powerful and smart scammer figures in history. Eg: The Aviator, Casino. An answer on how shady sales works, and who ends up to be the winner and loser. In my opinion The Wolf of Wall Street is a film where repeats it's self over and over again, leaving out important details of the real downfall of our protagonist fun adventure. Instead is focusing on his personal details of his relationship with drugs and women. More like a Vegas 'fairytale' than a Wall St. story. An arsenic comedy, that makes men's dreams visual. Leonardo DiCaprio again exceeds himself with a dizzying interpretation accomplishes something terribly difficult: to interpret a hero by nature excessive and explosive, with control, restraint, and radiation power.I recommend it because of the fact that it's a typical Scorsese film , which breathes through a closed circuit of people who experience the sweetest success and steeper fall, pleasure and guilt , promiscuity and punishment.",Null,2,8,27 December 2013
