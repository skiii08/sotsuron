The Blair Witch Project," The greatest horror movie ever conceived!
",This movie is just pure brilliance. There is no other words to describe it. It keeps you twisted in its terrifying story-line all the way through until it reaches an ending that stays with you as you exit the theater and drive home. Even in bed you will still have a pit of pure dread in your stomach.,Null,1,2,25 July 1999
