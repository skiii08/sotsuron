Marie Antoinette," Sofia's Hamptons Rerun
","Although perhaps deserving some applause for the costumes and settings, most everything else about this movie was pretty dreadful. It reminded me strongly of an ugly out-of-body experience in the shoe department of Saks: I was surrounded by a pack of wealthy, privileged Upper East Side (OK-New York) women examining $800 shoes and talking about them as if they were very, very important. I activated my red Converse hi-tops and got out of there.Thus, when the blond (Mid-western?) Marie/Kirsten Dunst said 'Oh Wow' in response to the presentation of an over-abundance of beautiful fabrics and shoes and a ballet of pastries (as 'I Want Candy' played in the background), I had a flashback to Saks. I realized that the problem with the movie was that Sofia had created a Versailles that corresponded to life in the richest regions of the late 20th century Hamptons in which she came of age. The American accents were the worst and the choice of Jason Schwartman as a catatonic or special needs Louis the 16th was really a disaster. The acting, as a result of directorial inadequacies or, worse, intent, was pretty abysmal in the context. Enabled by her family fame and money, Sofia Coppola has once again, as in Lost in Translation, brought us another boring memorial to her spoiled rich-girl life.Luckily, the movie was beautiful to look at. I enjoyed, in the main, the rock/pop background music (there were a couple of places where it got out-of-hand) and liked the occasional camp, whether intentional or accidental.Comes the revolution, I've got my scythe. And I have an excuse for being in the shoe department at Saks.",4,0,0,28 February 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," Clichéd W/ Some Funny Scenes & Cameo Characters
","This movie came highly recommended by a friend in the movie industry whose own tastes run to foreign, esoteric and intellectual. He described it as one of the best movies he's seen recently. With this in mind, I was very excited about seeing the film and, also, expecting an awful lot. I was disappointed.First, the entire film hinges on an untenable postulate: an adorable, chubby, sweet, kind little girl from Alberquerque (Olive, played magnificently by Abigail Breslin) has won, by default, a beauty pageant and been invited to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine competition in California. Her coach is her grandfather, a heroin snorting, randy old man with a penchant for loud shirts, leather vests and T&A magazines. The rest of her family has never seen her routine and has had no part of designing her hair, make-up and costumes.The Hoover family is entirely dysfunctional but each of the individual members is engaging in his or her strangeness. Indeed, these idiosyncratic characters are the movies strength and salvation. My favorite was Dwayne, the 15 year old son who is fascinated with Nietzche, has taken a vow of silence until he attains his objective of getting into the Air Force Academy to become a jet fighter pilot and is, at heart, a great kid.The family speeds toward California in a decrepit bright-yellow VW bus that is used for rather clichéd comic purposes, including attracting a clichéd, potbellied, red-neck motorcycle cop who ultimately lets them off when he finds grandpa's T&A magazines in the back of the bus. I won't tell you what he, bigoted redneck stereotype that he is, fails to see right before his eyes in the process.In California the Hoovers find that the pageant is really for air-brushed, powdered, big-haired 7 year olds dressed to look like Las Vegas showgirls (this was realism, not humor). The audience of the pageant is filled with other-America stereotypes, including one 400 pounder woman and a tattooed biker who is a follower of these shows and clearly comes for the bumps and grinds.Then the ending! How merry. What a charming moral (I hear the director defended the stale jump-start-the-bus bits as a symbol of the family pulling together). Gag me with a spoon. But I guess this is Hollywood's vision of wholesome.",7,1,3,28 February 2007
Ratatouille," Cute (So-oh-oh Disney) versus WOW
","I recently saw 'Paprika' and 'Ratatouille' in close succession, in that order. I can only say that 'Ratatouille' was an intense disappointment, especially when measured against a film like 'Paprika,' which demonstrates the adult potential of animation. The Rat story was a kid story with a good moral but was unexceptional and banal in its execution on the screen. Unlike 'Spirited Away' & 'My Neighbor Totoro,' which are both moral stories appropriate for children (as opposed to, say, 'Grave of the Fireflies'), 'Ratatouille' was not at all sophisticated or imaginative in its presentation. Big noses and crooked teeth are a limited device for conveying the Gallic character and the villain's pencil-thin moustache made him look as if he'd been recycled from a WW II animated piece on the Pacific theatre.I am not an unmitigated fan of Japanese popular culture which is often kitschy and misogynistic, but its clear that if animation is the measure, American productions are the mega-losers.",7,0,3,21 July 2007
The Dark Knight," Sadly Disappointing.
","Heath Ledger and the FX for the first hour were the only redeeming things about this movie.Ledger certainly deserves an Oscar for this film, not because he's dead but because he was amazing as the Joker. His performance as the essence of deranged evil, he was astounding, this despite the fact that the writer had him pontificating on the nature of man and chaos theory. It was the physical performance that was extraordinary. The scene of the Joker prancing around in the nurse's uniform was surreal and hysterical at the same time (but maybe that's part of surrealism.Once the movie reached a point where it seemed to be repeating special effects just to do so, it lost me. It was WAY too long, repetitive & pseudo-intellectual.",5,7,14,10 August 2008
The Departed," F for the Departed
","The day long movie, The Departed (it was a mere 2-1/2 hours but seemed like a day), is one of a very few movies I've found valueless. It is difficult to comprehend what the critics and the Motion Picture Academy are thinking in their various homages to this. I guess Scorsese is the magic word.The last shot in the movie, a rat toodling along the balcony of the corrupt Colin Sullivan's (Matt Damon) luxury apartment in downtown Boston (the luxury apartment that no honest cop in the Special Investigations Unit realizes that Sullivan is living in on his $30,000 plus salary?) is emblematic of the ham-handed approach of the movie's makers. There are probably a dozen missteps by Sullivan that would have raised the curiosity of colleagues with an IQ higher than that of my cats but, hey, we know cops are dumb.The Departed was totally lacking in finesse or intelligence and pandered to a crowd that has no trouble believing that all cops are either stupid or corrupt (or both); that undercover cops wherever they are are permitted to engage is every sort of violent, brutal and destructive act short of intentional murder by their handlers and that Baghdad-like firefights on the streets of major American cities and blood gurgling (or spurting) out of people's mouths or spattered on the walls and floors are realistic.The approach of the movie was actually insulting to the audience (and, by the way, to black officers, making the nice black officer from the training cadre one of the principal mechanisms of the hero's undoing). Lest we fail to respect and empathize sufficiently with Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen), the incorruptible head of SIU, Scorsese takes Billy Costigan/DiCaprio (and us) into his home and has Queenan talk about his wonderful wife and son at college. Any suspense about whether Queenan would be among those left standing at the end of the film was instantly dispelled. I immediately ordered a wreath for his grave.The movie was a waste of a great collection of actors. I'm not a DiCaprio fan but he was OK in the ridiculous role he was asked to play, although I don't consider lip-pursing acting. Mark Wahlberg, as Sgt. Dignam, a foul-mouthed but fiercely honest cop with good street instincts was about the best of the lot. And, in the end, the directors turn him into a cold-blooded murderer. Jack Nicholson was Jack Nicholson, which is OK. I suppose there are mobsters capable of clever one liners somewhere. The opera reverie scene in which he has a fantasy (?) of tossing cocaine into the air like fairy dust over two of his bimbos was, like the balcony rat at the end, insultingly gross.I wonder what this movie could have been if it had been written and directed by people with intelligence, finesse and reserve.",4,17,31,23 February 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Another Disappointment Fueled By Uncritical Critics
","After reading a couple of over-the-top reviews in New York publications, I was anxious to see Vicky Christina Barcelona. I felt that I had not seen a truly enjoyable Allen movie for about two decades, believing that Allen -- although he talked the self-disparaging talk -- had long ago begun to take himself much too seriously. And this was before his despicable personal behavior in ending his marriage for his stepdaughter (using, undoubtedly, many of the rationalizations he has raised to gospel in this movie). I'd hated Matchpoint both because it was improbable (which I can tolerate in an otherwise well-conceived and executed work) and because it is difficult to 'hear' Woody Allen opining on moral ambiguity. Although I realized that there were possible mines lying in wait in VCB, the reviews were so good; I had just (finally) seen Bardem in The Sea Inside and liked it very much; I am going to Barcelona in a few weeks; I had just seen Elegy with it's wonderful performance by Cruz, so I figured how bad could it be?? Barcelona and the cinematography were beautiful and Cruz was stupendous. Bardem, Hall and Johansson were all pretty wooden (which could be attributed in part to the script) and neither Hall nor Johansson is fit to share the stage with Cruz (or even Bardem for that matter). In fact, if the truth be spoken, from most angles Johansson has a decidedly porcine look no matter how they dress her up. And imaging a neo-Picasso falling for Johansson or Hall was truly funny. Sure, wanting to get into their pants was credible -- as Dave Van Ronk said in Cocaine Blues, 'You take Mary, I'll take Sue/Can' tell the difference between the two/Turn 'em upside down.'Worst of all, both the overlying narrative and the screeds of the various characters on the subject of sexual freedom and not succumbing to a banal life with a person one didn't truly, passionately love had a terrible effect on me visually. It was as if I were one of Annie Hall's WASP parents....the speaker's face, whoever it was, would turn into schlubby Woody Allen right before my eyes and the sentiments were rendered vapid and ridiculous without the redeeming humor of Allen's early movies.Moving his films out of New York has not saved Allen from the pit of self-indulgent, pretentious twaddle that he fell into sometime at the end of the eighties or in the early nineties.Since writing this I have visited Barcelona, where I learned that Allen was paid to use Barcelona & to promote it. Not surprising from this ethical paragon....",5,4,15,24 August 2008
