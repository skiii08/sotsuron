The Avengers," Best movie ever!
",Was really super impressed with the story line! Sound effects were awesome! Loved everything about this movie. Hope they make something similar to this,10,1,1,11 May 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," What happened here?
","Music was repetitive not much variety, theme didn't really line up with the previous Thor movies and had more of a futuristic yet fluro 80s feel which was not fitting in different ways. Some of the dialog was bad and wasn't really that funny. Thors acting felt a little off and plain. Outfits felt not right for Thor and his brother. The grandmaster should of had some more screen time. Animation and sound effects were good as usual",4,7,12,30 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Wow!
",Movie was fantastic! Sound effects excellent. Too many characters and not enough screen time. Was fantastic that they brought back people who were wiped out. Hope they bring back iron man at some point. Curious who was brought back and if it was just requested that it was just half the population thanos wiped out or more such as asgard itself or odin for example,6,2,5,11 May 2019

Thor: The Dark World," Perfect movie
",The sound effects were awesome! What happened was excellent! Loved that little trick Thor and Loki did. The dark elf was cool and the infinity stone. Just needed to have more screen time for certain scenes,10,1,1,11 May 2019
