Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Back to the spirit of the Black Pearl
","These Pirates films are all about entertainment and thankfully this latest adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow at the helm is back to basics, reminding me of the formula that made the very first one, Curse of the Black pearl so great. Don't worry I won't give anything away here but be aware that the opening 20 minutes is one funny sequence and quirky one liner after another. There is also a couple of hilarious cameos, one may be familiar but the other was a right royal shock. Depp walks through his lethargic swaying pirate character with ultimate ease, while new high seas bad boy Blackbeard is exceptional, but not as cool as Sparrows former flame played by Cruz. She is foxy, feisty and funny. The action is elevated by some wonderful 3D effects but I am sure the film would be just as rocking without it. Finally, the highlight is the Mermaid scenes. As dark as they are, they take the viewer into their web of intrigue. Australian Gemma Ward even sings during an evocative moment. Remember to stay on after the credits for an EXTRA scene. After the last two installments left me crying with disappointment, I Loved it.",7,65,115,16 May 2011
Men in Black 3," One highlight, Josh Brolin has perfected Tommy Lee Jones
","Well it's been 10 years since the dismal MIB2 where Johnny Knoxville at the height of his Jackass fame was miscast as an obscure evil sidekick, so 3 is at the very least an improvement. However, the 3D is not worthy, while other than a few decent gags from the fast talking Will Smith, it's Josh Brolin who steals every scene he appears in as the young Agent K. Sending Agent J back to the swinging 1960's New York was cool, especially in a clever Andy Warhol moment and a few observational one-liners The non-event plot as it turns out could have been extended more and gets plain ridiculous at a NASA launch, but there is a nice emotional touch at the end, but too little too late. Certain scenes are expertly choreographed, effects are mostly cool, the bad guy here (both versions) is a waste of time and boring. Overall MIB3D works as popcorn entertainment for kids.",6,16,31,20 May 2012
Ted," Gordon's Alive! DROP DEAD FRED ramped up by a thousand
","Very funny, I have not laughed so much for a very long time and that was even before the salute of FLASH GORDON kicks in with a cameo from Sam J. Jones. Remember 'Drop Dead Fred', the crazy imaginary friend of Pheobe Cates who caused all sorts of mischief, well TED is real and TED is a party animal, literally. He drinks, smokes, dances with hookers and has never left the side of his best (thunder) buddy played by Mark Wahlberg. As time goes by Mark and his amazing girlfriend played by Mila Kunis want to live alone without TED. Havoc erupts creating some amusing scenes not soon forgotten. TED is a comedy that the recent debacle starring Adam Sandler 'That's my Boy' failed to be, edgy, unique and most importantly, funny. See this now, Go Flash Go.",8,4,12,26 June 2012
21 Jump Street," Yes its good and full of funny!
","No way am I saying who turns up in cameos during this surprisingly very funny and cool reworking of the famed 80's television show. Channing Tatum is on a roll after 'The Vow' while 'Jonah Hill' is on another type of roll after his Oscar Nomination. Both are a fantastic duo of young looking policeman who go undercover to a high school to track down a supplier of a new synthetic drug frequently used by the students. The film has little decorum kicking into gear within minutes and not really slowing down. The little things in the boys comic routine is what works best, their one liners, banter with Ice Cube and the quips referring to high schoolers. Forget the script, this is just fun action fluff better than 'Project X' and 'This Means War' put together. Excellent soundtrack too and Brie Larson backs up her coolness she displayed in the best unknown movie ever; JUST PECK. The original TV theme gets a run during the final credits.",7,5,15,6 March 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The fireworks have yet to be lit, a long slow boring journey
","The effects are of course, amazing, but really, this part one of part seven is so boring. The joy and youth of all the previous films are gone which is understandable, but the trio of protagonists, Harry, Hermonie and Ron have a road trip of sorts. Largely left to their own devices, I wanted Harry to wave his magical wand around and hurry proceedings up. The darkest and most glum of the films, Lord Voldemort is the personification of evil. He wants to take over the world, not just Hogwarts and the Ministry of magic. The acting is super, all casting is perfect with Helena Bonham Carter a standout. The anticipation of a big cliffhanger will be on the minds of all watching as the audience is aware the finale is not released until July. All I can say is the fireworks have yet to be lit. Take in an extra choc-top this is a sedate film to say the least, however, fans won't mind a bit. There is a clever animated sequence that explains exactly what the deathly hallows are by the way, over all, slick but slow.",5,8,55,15 November 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Better version, don't mention the 'DIFFERENT' ending
","Not long out of a screening and I am still thinking about this English language version of the mega popular Swedish Millennium films GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO, GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST derived from the brilliant bestsellers. Purists may be up in arms, but think outside the box, what I witnessed was an almost perfect movie.It does, however, have an ending that will divide the audience, different from the foreign version but good enough for me to want to see the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. Anyhow all I will say is you will not be bored in the 2.5 hrs of grim proceedings. Daniel Craig is a perfect choice as the journalist Mikael Blomkvist disgraced for libel but takes on a memoir writing case to escape, only to be drawn into a web of secrets and family weirdness. His new partner is all the talk and so she should be. Rooney Mara I predicted big things from the second I saw her in Youth in Revolt and she carried the otherwise ordinary Elm Street remake long before her cameo in Social Network. She's also very good looking, holds her poise, strikes like a cobra and walks with complexities unknown to the common man. Christopher Plummer, Steven Berkoff and Robin Wright are unique fillers on screen but not as effective as the great Stellan Skarsgard who is despicable to the point of exhaustion. Mara is a standout as the tough motorcycle riding computer hacker with a actual heart, Lisbeth Salander. Magnificent shock tactics are not overblown as Lisbeth carries out proceedings on a dark missing persons case. Original scenes have been lifted from the source, but tweaked. The music is a standout, typical Direction magic from David Fincher seals the deal to make thus unmissable. GIVE ROONEY MARA an Oscar nomination please, she engulfs Salander as did Noomi Rapace.",9,64,123,13 December 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Tense and confrontational, full tilt action
","Best enjoyed on the big screen, a very big screen if you choose to accept it, an in form Tom Cruise returns as Agent Ethan Hunt. Forced to go rogue to clear his name after an international incident at the Kremlin, he's set up as the culprit. Plot holes aside, this is a sweeping high tech adventure with the teams visit to Dubai the standout seeing Tom dangling off the worlds tallest building with a sandstorm moving his way. Globetrotting edge of your seat moments are truly breathtaking. The Incredibles director Brad Bird proves he can manage live action and ramps it up a few extra notches to prove his point. Put your reservations of Tom Crusie off screen aside, he rocks without flinching that edge at any stage. Paula Patton looks magnificent and Simon Pegg provides some comic relief, however the trailers make you think this is funnier than it is. M.I.4 is thundering excitement. Ving Rhames cameos.",8,11,26,14 December 2011
Moulin Rouge!," Wickedly romantic in a blaze of extraordinary color
","Those who may remember Zsa Zsa Gabor in the 1950's version by director John Huston and hope that this one is similar, leave the room now. Aussie style meister Baz Lurhman in collaboration with his designer wife Catherine Martin and director of photography Don McAlpine have made Moulin Rouge their own. Nicole Kidman holds a tune to perfection singing a few songs on a soundtrack so diverse with something for everbody indeed. She plays the untouchable unless you have money, a-lot of it, main attraction at Paris's most famous night club. Along comes a gifted poet (Ewan Mc Gregor) who has a knack for writing romance in prose which will in-turn become famous romantic songs in the future. They're unlikely love affair is opposed by an evil, rich English Duke (Richard Roxburgh) and he will stop at nothing to bed his woman. This film does not let you take a breath. Filmed entirely at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, Moulin Rouge dazzled me and is wickedly romantic in a blaze of extrordinary color.",Null,0,0,20 May 2001
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," If I was female I would have loved it
","It's OK, yes OK. However I am a guy so my outlook on it may be very different to all females. It is a series of books which has been also been translated to the screen with the intended audience in mind, female. There's a bit to like though. The special effects have been ramped up with a bigger budget and there's less Edward, yay. OK, alright, he's OK too, he's just not in it too much. The relationship / friendship between Bella and Jacob is the focus mostly. That is of course the race to Italy is on. Vampire royalty of Italy is about to be shaken up by a Cullen and a Swan. The story isn't bad, some liberties have been taken to change the book, but it won't matter to those who haven't yet. Is there anybody? Robert Pattinson will have the audience swooning, as will the werewolf boys, after they have changed back into topless human form that is. I know everyone will see this regardless what I say, however I just hope 'Eclipse' is superior.",6,4,20,17 November 2009
Clash of the Titans," It's Boring and the 3D is useless
","I tried to like this mess but with memories of the cult classic original I was super keen to see this remake. Aussie Sam Worthington is made for this movie, he is not the problem, it's the darkness, the noise and the stupid situations. How did the scorpions accept a rider to steer it around. No spoilers from me just one more thing, WHY WAS IT IN 3D. There was simply no need to see this in 3D as in my eyes it was not effective until the final credits. Then there was the camp factor, sure, the sparkling jacket worn by Zeus is like something Wayne Newton might wear, but the fake Greek pillars in Mount Olympus look like a set from Showgirls. Overall its nothing more than a big lightweight expensive kids film. The music was good, the battle between hero Perseus and evil Medusa was watchable and a highlight, but nothing memorable. Even the magnificent mechanical owl from the original gets dissed and flying horse Pegasus is Black! huh....This won't hurt Sam's growing career but not good.",5,5,10,1 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," You will be clutching the chair your sitting in
","I saw a special screening of this frightening film last week and I have never been so scared in my life and I watch a lot of horror/thrillers. Blair Witch Project freaked me out 10 years ago because I knew nothing about it, similar to Paranormal Activity, I knew little and it worked it's magic on me. A slow build up of a couple who think there may be a presence with them in their new house. Wow, things get worse every night. Filmed on video camera mode, there's actually comedy too, but this couple are doomed, it's just extremely scary getting there. I had a water bottle in which I squeezed the life out of and wet the people behind me in the last scene. Intense heart pounding chills, I couldn't breath.",9,23,50,31 August 2009
Limitless," Careful what you wish for, Limitless is a mind bender
","Wild. This is a trip worth taking in more ways than one. The usually handsome Bradley Cooper plays would be novelist and extreme under achiever Eddie. Sporting a bad haircut, he's obnoxious and one of the biggest losers seen on the big screen for very a long time. After being dumped by his girlfriend in public, he stumbles into his lowest point of living. However, through various circumstances he is offered a new mystery drug, largely untested it is a pill to heighten brain activity and body senses. What follows is a turnaround in Eddie's life, an ability to recall every bit of information he's been exposed to his entire life. The drug is no simple steroid and there's a catch, a big one. He must continue to take the pills or his body will deteriorate as quick as it was pumped up. Bradley Cooper is so good he's almost nauseating, switching from no hoper to know it all with perennial ease. Legendary Robert DeNiro is a major player in the film creating surprises, the less said about him the better. Plot holes throughout I overlooked as Limitless took effect. Must See.",8,2,6,14 March 2011
In Time," It's not 'Inception' or even 'Logan's Run' it's 'In Time'
","No spoilers here but let me just say that the trailer doesn't give the film any curious benefits. Timberlake can act, that goes without saying now, but he is let down a little by the story. In a nutshell, there's no money in this futuristic world, there's time. There are also zones as named in the film that start from the ghettos to the ultra high class. Once someone is 25 they need to work to earn time to stay alive but the higher the zone the longer the life. J.T plays Will, who after an unfortunate family circumstance and a meeting of a stranger ends up with lot's of time. Moving up zones he meets a beautiful daughter (The china doll-like Amanda Seyfried) of a rich banker type with infinity time in his possession. The pair get together and go on the run in an inspired Robin Hood type escapade. Andrew Niccol also directed the superior 'Gattaca' and this does have a few unique ideas, just not enough explanations either. Cillian Murphy rocks though.",Null,8,18,26 October 2011
Thor," An Englishman, an Australian & a Hammer
","Having just seen the global premiere of Thor - God of Thunder, in Sydney Australia, all I can say is ....wow! Don't worry readers I am not about to give away one single spoiler, however after some time and anticipation, Thor is a winner. Australian Chris Hemsworth graced the red carpet in all his native glory, talking up the film and his future entity in The Avengers. He was joined by Shakespeare aficionado Director Kenneth Brangh and co stars Jamie Alexander & Tom Hiddleston who plays crowd favourite Loki. Thor is a good movie, plenty of action, a lovely heroine (Natalie Portman) and some interesting sidekicks. Costumes rock, not to mention the obligatory Marvel characters making significant cameos, not just the extra scene after the credits, but within the film itself. I was a little over superhero movies recently but this is not to be missed.",8,85,170,17 April 2011
X-Men: First Class," the prequel we had to have
","Fans may disagree with me but, this reboot was needed after Wolverine Origins brought down the X-Men universe to a shambling mess, however it is also a step up from the third X-Men film. Seeing the youthful Professor X and Magneto as best friends working together before becoming archenemies is a brilliant concept. The mutants, some familiar, some not so familiar are well represented among the human existence. Settings around the early 1960's is a brilliant move with the era lovingly created, especially the costumes. Frantic and loud as they may be, the action set pieces are nothing short of astonishing. The submarine moment lives up to the excitement of the trailer. January Jones just needs to appear on screen as sultry Emma Frost to captivate me, while Australian Rose Byrne rocks as Doc MacTaggert. Perfect casting of McAvoy and Fassbender as Xavier and Magneto respectively is a constant winner. I know the fans are going to probably hate Kevin Bacon, he's different to his comic character. Lame one liners aside, this is a fine accompaniment to the Marvel film plethora on the horizon. Also watch for a rather vulgar but memorable cameo from a 'hairy' X-Men favorite.",6,4,32,30 May 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Drop everything RUSH to this now
","WOW strap yourself in this is going to be remembered long after you leave the cinema. Without giving you any spoilers let me just say from the opening sky high scene that rivals the best of any James Bond scenario the pace is set for a bleak, but thrilling 'so called' conclusion mastermind Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series. Soon to be the new Mad-Max, Tom Hardy (seen but not forgotten in Sucker Punch) plays ultra bad guy Bane with amazing confrontation. Challenging Batman mentally and physically you will not soon forget his chaotic reign. Anne Hathaway albeit an alarming choice as Selina/Catwoman will surprise the die-hards while the amazing cast is listless, Michael Caine has some tender moments amongst the mayhem and new addition Joseph Gordon-Levitt challenges to further his history with and legacy of the Wayne foundation. Spiderman will spin off into the distance the minute the caped crusader appears in cinemas. Must see.",9,14,29,17 July 2012
Easy A," More gossip than Gossip Girl and it's better!
","Thank you Emma Stone for helping this movie become the enjoyable romp it is. Mostly sarcastic, but always cutting in it's portrayal of whats right and whats wrong. Don't be fooled, this is no 'Mean Girls', nor is it a chick flick, it's a tale of a faux tramp who gains hallway cred for her gay best-friend. Everyone believes Olive (Emma Stone) is now a harlot with a one track mind seeking trim any way she can get it. Spiralling out of control after she helps with others to provide false sexual endeavors, the film frequently references 'The Scarlet Letter'. To say much more will give away more than I am prepared to. With Stanley Tucci in the cast as Olive's hipster ex hippie Father & Thomas Hayden Church as an obscure teacher, it's a must see. Truth envy ensures right to the final credit. Give Emma a rookie Oscar!",7,7,15,13 September 2010
