Hereditary," Horrible acting and script
","Just saw this last night and don't know what to call it. It was the only movie I've seen where everyone in the theater booed and laughed at the acting. I feel like it was written by someone who can't read, write or care about their or anyone else's work. I hope that the man or men responsible for this never get work again. This is what I would hope qualifies as a career killer, because I wish I had slept instead of going to this movie. I want my money, time, and expectations back. Do not watch or let ANYONE YOU KNOW GO TO THIS MOVIE.I am amazed to see user reviews here. They are either been paid or this is the first time they have seen a horror movie or any movie. This movie is not a horror or even a thriller. There were some moments of jump scare, but trust me, this movie is so bad that you will exit the theatres scratching your head thinking what the heck......and why did I even spent anything on this piece of garbage.",1,4,8,25 June 2018
