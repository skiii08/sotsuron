The Blair Witch Project," Did I Miss Something?
","I came out of 'The Blair Witch Project' feeling as if I had missed the punch line to a joke.  I had heard that was a contemporary 'Night of the Living Dead' and 'The Exorcist' and I decided that I had to see it.  I wasn't very impressed.  Sure there are some scary moments and watching the three students' predicament get slowly but surely worse provided some good psychological scares as well.  However, I expected more.  All the hoopla the media has made over this film just isn't warranted.  Maybe I'll try my luck with 'The Last Broadcast'.  Go see 'Blair Witch' if you wish but if you come out feeling like you missed something, I warned you.",Null,0,1,25 August 1999
Casablanca," Simply The Best Film of All Time!!!!
","Casablanca is my favorite film of all time.  It's as close to perfection as a movie can get.  The movies of today could learn a lot of lessons from Casablanca.  Casablanca is perfectly scripted.  Every scene is perfectly timed to where each builds on to the next never dragging on or using needless words that bog down the plot.  The direction is also flawless. Just watch the final scene at the airport for proof (After, of course, seeing the rest of the film).  And the acting.  Humphery Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, need I say more?  If you have seen Casablanca, you already know what I mean, if not, SEE IT!  Run right out to the video store and rent it.  You will not be disappointed,  As a matter of fact, as time goes by you see the beginning of a beautiful friendship.  I know I did.",Null,0,0,5 March 2000
