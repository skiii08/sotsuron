The Benchwarmers," A Good Underdog Story with a Kick!
","I took my daughter's softball team to see this and we ALL loved it! I am not a Napolean Dynamite fan, but this was great! Each of the main characters were outrageously funny. It was great to see Rob Schneider play something beside a geek. If you were one of those kids who was always on the receiving end of a wedgie, swirly or just the last one picked in a baseball game, this movie is for you! If you were the bully who was the giver of these little taunts, then you really need to see this! If you want a good, clean laugh without the 4 letter words, sexual innuendos or become embarrassed that you brought your family, then this is for you. If you didn't like this movie, then maybe you were the bully and just don't get it!",7,0,1,11 April 2006
