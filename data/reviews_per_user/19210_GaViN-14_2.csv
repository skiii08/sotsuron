Antz," I went to see this movie because I'm interested in 3D Animation.... I thought it was gonna suck, but it's actually pretty good....
",I liked Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone's voices.... Woody Allen was o.k. too.... I went to this movie thinking it was a kid's movie and that it was gonna be bad.... but it's pretty good.... I suggest you go see it.,8,0,0,4 October 1998
American History X," Best movie I've seen since Schindler's List....
","This movie made me think, which almost no movie ever does to me.... being born in Austria and living there for 15 years, makes you deal with skinheads and that kind of racism a lot.... no other movie I've seen so far portrays them better than this one.... a must see, for everyone who can handle a movie w/out a happy end....",10,0,0,2 November 1998
