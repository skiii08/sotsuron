Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It took George Lucas 17 years to come up with this??
","It takes one hell of a script to make great actors like Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson look bad but somehow this film managed it. There was no plot to speak of and where was the characterization? OK, so they saved the world at the end but I really didn't care and Darth Maul was a boring villain - he wasn't even scary, bring back Darth Vader. The movie looked great but in the end it was a triumph of style over substance. An insult to the original trilogy.",1,1,4,22 March 2001
The Breakfast Club," THE definitive '80's movie.
","'They only met once but it changed their lives forever'Yet another wonderfully angsty teen movie from the master of the genre, possibly John Hughes' best although 'Somekind Of Wonderful' and 'Ferris Beuller's..' are both great. The plot is simple yet effective (5 different kids have to spent saturday detention together, a brain, a basket case, a jock, a princess and a criminal). The cast are excellent, a stand out being Judd Nelson as the wonderfully sarcastic and wise-cracking John Bender. This movie has to been seen when you are a teenager or it won't have the same impact. Check your mind at the door and enjoy!",Null,0,1,23 March 2001
