Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the Best Sci-Fi Movies Made...So Far...
","As of this review there are 1593 other reviews, but after reading about a hundred I am left wondering why everyone seems to hate this movie. It's not supposed to be taken seriously! It's supposed to take you to a 'galaxy far, far away'. Some things in other worlds probably won't make sense to us.
People hate Jar Jar Binks. I thought he was one of the funniest  charactures in the entire film. (Of course I love the Ewoks, too.) The acting is stiff, it follows the rest of the movies in which the acting seemed like something out of Ed Wood's films. The storyline was beautiful. It didn't fill the screen with Darth Maul like Lucas did with Vader and I'm glad. Darth Vader was a good villian, but there was to much of him. Darth Maul was just in the background - like a 'Phantom Menace'. So for all you people who hate this movie. Shut your mouth. It's  one of the best films ever concieved!!!",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
