Ford v Ferrari," 'Ford v Ferrari': Do What You Love
","Peacefully gazing into the dusk sky, racer savant Ken Miles, played by Christian Bale, lies on the race track next to his son Peter, played by innocently radiant Noah Jupe. Ken describes the experience of being one with his racing car: 'Everything slows down'. Ken says introspectively, 'You see everything.' That's the freedom and joy of doing what you love.Director James Mangold's 'Ford v Ferrari' tells the story of Ford Motor Company's challenge of Ferrari in the legendary 24-hours race at Le Mans in 1966. Matt Damon plays Carroll Shelby, the American car designer, who Henry Ford II, played by believable Tracy Letts, asks to engineer a car to beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Carroll's volatile friend and elite driver is Ken.Carroll was the only American to ever win at Le Mans. But that was the glorious past. Presently, Carroll has a failing heart valve. His racing days are history. Now, he's the very successful businessmen, selling his designer cars to dudes, who don't appreciate his art, his love.In the movie's opening narration, Carroll describes driving his car at 7000 rpms. He's in the zone. His epiphany, 'The only question that really matters: Who are you?' As much as 'Ford v Ferrari' is about the landmark automotive racing milestone, I was touched most by the story by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth, and Jason Keller in its poignant look at what we love, what is that meaningful to us.Christian Bale and Matt Damon have authentic screen brotherhood in the pursuit of their ideal, dedicating the best versions of themselves for what they truly love, that being racing. In the bigger picture of James's 'Ford V Ferrari', 'racing' could be whatever is that meaningful to you. Christian and Matt give one of most their moving and humane performances. They're both Oscar worthy.At the 'dog and pony show' for Ford's unveiling of their Mustang car, Matt's Carroll accepts Ford's job to engineer a car to win at Le Mans. Charismatic Matt recalls the wisdom of Carroll's Father, who advised to do what you love, then 'it's no longer a job'. Matt poignantly says, 'Find what you have to do...' Amen.Carroll sees the best in Christian's Ken. Ken is the 45 year-old World War II Hero, who's broke, and running his own automotive repair shop. His beautiful wife Mollie, played by strong compassionate Caitriona Balfe, is supportive of Ken, but so weary of working other jobs to keep the family afloat, including son Peter.Although, not classically studied Ken is the engineering savant. He amazingly diagnoses the imperfection of any car by just driving it. Yet, he's the strident smartass, who is blunt in his assessments to everyone. That runs amok with superfluous Ford Executive VP Leo Beebe, played by slickly good Josh Lucas.Predictably, Leo's egomania tests Carroll's loyalty to Ken, who might be the best race driver on Planet Earth. That might be the lone narrative downside. Also given this historical retelling, we kind of figure out how things go. Just saying.Phedon Papmichael's cinematography mesmerizes. Phedon captures the visceral impact of speed and danger in every turn in the larger expanse. Still, I was moved in the close up of Christian's visage on the speeding straight away. The calm serenity. Ken gets who he is.My favorite scene: Ken looks at the picture Peter drew of the racetrack. Christian's Ken meticulously describes what he has to do in each individual turn. Peter looks at his Dad in wonder. That's 'the perfect lap'. Peter asks, what if you can't race 'the perfect lap'. Ken smiles, 'You keep trying.' Because that's what you do for what you love. That's what makes 'Ford v Ferrari' so very special too.",10,3,7,2 December 2019
The King's Speech," True Friendship
","During his coronation rehearsal Colin Firth's King George VI screams, 'I have a voice!' His speech coach Lionel Logue played by Geoffrey Rush quietly responds, 'Yes, you do.' 'King's Speech' is the best movie of the year. 'King's Speech' is absolutely inspiring and touching. Firth and Rush have an amazing and moving partnership. Based on the true story of King George VI of England before World War II, when he became king after his brother King Edward was forced to abdicate the throne when he chooses to marry twice divorced American Wallis Simpson—forbade by the Church of England. King George suffers debilitating stammering speech. Paradoxically, Screenwriter Danny Cohen's words are inspired eloquence. Tom Hooper's direction is powerful and resonates with a tangible authenticity. 'King's Speech' is about overcoming the fear of and reclaiming one's greatness. In a heartbreaking scene in the King's den, George (Firth) weeps to his very soul, 'I'm not a king! I'm not a king!' If you replace the word 'king' with 'great', I think you get the profound transformation at play. Everyone has a fear of sucking or looking bad. Perhaps, the most profound fear for everyone is actually being great. Lionel's wife Myrtle (understanding Jennifer Ehle) inquires about his melancholy. He says it is about his client— secretly George. 'He can be great.' But George doesn't know that. Lionel has a telling conversation with Berty (his personal address for George); he asks him, 'What are you so fearful of?' Berty is afraid of becoming King—he is afraid of being great. As 'King's Speech' opens we painfully witness Berty (Firth) stammer through a public speaking engagement. He is the second son of King George V (gently intolerant Michael Gambon), so not directly in line to the Throne. Firth embodies Berty's decency and enlightened self awareness. Following the embarrassing Christmas radio speech, Berty and his devoted wife Elizabeth (strong and compassionate Helena Bonham Carter) approach heretic speech coach Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to correct this tragic flaw. Lionel is discounted on two levels: he is Australian, and is a failed stage actor without legitimate credentials. Berty assumes that Lionel is a Doctor. During the initial consult, Lionel discerns that Berty's stammering is nothing mechanical. At cause are his relationships with his Father King George V (Gambon) and future king brother Edward (elusive and charming Guy Pearce). Demonstrating his family loyalty to George V, his overbearing father never acknowledges him. Pearce brilliantly captures Edward as well intentioned, but completely irresponsible playboy. Although he loves his brother Berty, Edward mocks his solid and brave kid brother. England is on the verge of War with Germany, and King George V is deathly ailing. Aside from Elizabeth, Lionel truly sees Berty, the man is; the man can be. Rush confides to Berty (Firth), 'You are the most courageous man I know...' Berty never had any friends, much less Commoners. 'King's Speech' indelibly tells the touching story of a lifelong friendship and partnership. Colin Firth is compellingly vulnerable, and powerful. He will win an Oscar for Best Actor. Geoffrey Rush is electrifying in his compassion and unwavering belief in his friend. Their screen partnership is amazing. In the astounding story arc, Rush tells Firth to deliver the speech to him, as he would talk to his friend. That touched me profoundly. I have worked on my public speaking, not training nearly as hard as Berty, although forcing me to alter myself. Once while struggling through a practice speech with my dear friend and mentor John, he told me, 'Talk to me as your friend.' I got it. The cinematography, costume design, and music are impeccable in 'King's Speech'. I think the true power of 'King's Speech' is the story of profound love and lifelong friendship. True heroes see the greatness in others, and fulfill on that promise. 'King's Speech' is the best movie of the year that fulfills on this promise for everyone.",10,2,5,9 January 2011
Moneyball," The Metaphor
","Leaning over an introspective Brad Pitt as Billy Beane confesses to his assistant GM Peter played by Jonah Hill, ' It doesn't mean anything.' Pitt's Billy frames the context if his Oakland A's don't win it all. In the Big Picture, Billy gets it. And so does Director Bennett Miller in 'Moneyball'. Steven Zaillian ('Searching for Bobby Fisher', 'Schindler's List') and Alan Sorkin ('The Social Network') wrote the screenplay based on Michael Lewis's book, 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game'. Bennett's 'Moneyball' is about altering the way people think, and the genesis of leadership and greatness. 'Moneyball' is one of the best movies of the year. Brad Pitt is awesome.'Moneyball' recalls the story of the 2002 Oakland A's and their record breaking 20 game win streak, following the gutting of the team due to superstar free agency. The joke is that the A's much like other small venue franchises have become farm teams to the Yankee's, who have a $100 million plus payroll. Unlike other professional sports, the baseball salary cap void is indicative of Lewis's book's title. Brad Pitt plays Oakland A's GM Billy Beane, who was supposed to be baseball's next superstar when recruited back in 1979. Zaillian and Sorkin delicately weave that narrative thread, and Pitt eloquently evokes the regret of unrealized possibility. What makes 'Moneyball' so amazing is that it is more than just a baseball movie. Bennett subtly cops to this at the movie's catharsis when Pitt says to Hill, 'I get the metaphor.' It is about the romance of the game, about forging the greatness in people.'Moneyball' works because of Brad Pitt. What is refreshing is that he isn't asked to play unattractive here to be taken seriously. In fact he looks great and incredibly lean and fit, at his charming best. Pitt is amazing in communicating in his silence, whether he turning his back to the camera or in one scene as his eyes glaze over as his scouting staff discards a potential prospect, because he has an ugly girl friend—obviously has low confidence. In a radical move Pitt's Billy hires Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) as his assistant, after discerning his critical acumen in a negotiation. Hill lands perfectly with Peter's humble genius and earnestness. Peter is a Yale graduate with a degree in Economics. Peter's revolutionary paradigm is that in baseball you don't buy superstars, you buy wins. More specifically, you buy runs, hits, and walks. Given the $38 million salary of the A's, you are literally creating a team of 'misfit toys'. Peter's brilliance lies in analyzing the statistics and getting the undervalued talent. Pitt and Hill have amazing chemistry. They are funny together, and their underlying bond is respect. This is part of the touching humanity of 'Moneyball'.The other humanizing relationship is Billy with his young daughter Casey (wonderful Kerris Dorsey). Dorsey is the authentic shy teenager. She lives with her Mom, Billy's ex played by Robin Wright. Pitt has a natural fatherly partnership with Dorsey. Pitt has a beguiling charisma that is never overshadowed by kids. Together as Casey sings Billy the song she wrote for him, unpredictable movie magic emerges.What I found so inspiring about 'Moneyball': its soul is about reclaiming one's innate greatness. Billy and Peter acquire 37 year-old David Justice (commanding Stephen Bishop) in the twilight of his career. Pitt has a come to Jesus meeting with the aging superstar. Billy points out that Cleveland was willing to pay half his salary for him to play elsewhere. He admits to Justice that he is also gone if this experiment in Oakland is a bust. Pitt looks him in the eye and says, 'Be a leader.' This is just awesome stuff. Leaders generate other leaders, and alter the way we view the world. Pitt is amazing. He is uncompromising in his passion and humanity, and he delivers with humor and heart. This is a wonderfully scripted movie by Zaillian and Sorkin. Director Bennett elicits authentic performances from his impeccable cast. On the surface 'Moneyball' maybe about getting things on the cheap, but it is really about seeing the best in people. 'Moneyball' is more than just about baseball, it's about life. 'Moneyball' is one the best movies of the year.",10,4,8,24 September 2011
The Avengers," Believe in Heroes in 'The Avengers'
","Back on Earth through time and space, imperially arrogant god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) says, 'Freedom is the great lie' Thor's half brother will make the world his new kingdom. The brave souls, who stand in his path, are The Avengers. Director and Writer Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers' convincingly assembles solo superheroes and super egos to battle Loki and his alien minions in one of the year's best movies. Think of Whedon as Coach Phil Jackson, but for superheroes. Robert Downey Jr. as brash Tony Stark threatens Norse god Loki, 'If we can't protect the Earth, you can be damn sure we'll avenge it.' 'The Avengers' is awesome.The classic hero story requires a commanding villain, and that is Tom Hiddleston as Loki. Hiddleston is charismatic evil and sympathetic sadness. He evokes certain pathos for Loki, feeling betrayed by his foil half brother Thor, strong and compassionate Chris Hemsworth. Thor fights with all his might against his brother, out of love and honor. Blond maned and shredded Hemsworth balances aloof charm and conviction as Thor. Whedon's 'The Avengers' is timelessly inspiring: We believe in heroes who believe in themselves and others and would sacrifice their lives for the noble and just cause. I think the captivating leads of 'The Avengers' are Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. Downey Jr. brilliantly hides beneath Iron Man's Tony Stark's cynical narcissistic veneer, a caring man wiser than his smart ass punch lines. Evans is surprising. Aside from looking amazingly chiseled he embodies in Steve Rogers (Captain America) a self doubting relevance, while the inspired leader emerges. His Rogers is the frozen super soldier who awakens 70 years later into a new war.The cool Stark and the solid Rogers clash passionately. Stark mourns a fallen friend. Rogers asks if this is the first time he has lost a soldier. Stark screams, 'We are not soldiers!' Whedon and Zak Pen's story is kinetically driven, with the foundation laid in character. Powerful egos and intentions must coalesce and foster value and respect—as some sort of functional family tasked with saving the world.Whedon generates amazing performances, and infuses welcome wit and humor. To that end, Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury, Director of the clandestine S.H.I.E.L.D., maybe the sinuous plot device. After making a career of cameos in previous Marvel superhero movies, Jackson fleshes out his bad ass Fury. He brings a refreshing gruff self awareness, after all The Avengers was his initiative so that these heroes would fight the fight we couldn't. However, is he the tough love patriot or calculated manipulator? Jackson cannily walks that fine line. Beautiful and idealist Cobie Smulders as loyal Agent Hill is Fury's social conscience. Stark, Rogers, and Dr. Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discern Fury's possible other motives shrouded in National Security.Exiled Loki brokers an alliance with the warrior alien race, the Chitauri. The Chitauri will let him rule Earth, if he brings them the Tesseract (Hyper Cube). The Tesseract harnesses the power of the galaxy, and is mysteriously tied to both Thor and Captain America. Loki uses the Tesseract to escape exile and breach S.H.I.E.L.D. Obtaining Tesseract, he brainwashes brave Agent Hawkeye (solid Jeremy Renner). Loki has a grand scheme. Expert straight man Clark Gregg as reliable Agent Coulson must call upon the team to protect the world. Scarlett Johansson is hot and deadly as Agent Natasha (Black Widow). She dispatches Russian mafia captors with Muay Thai and jujitsu in Jason Statham like style. She heads off to Calcutta to find Dr. Bruce Banner, and his raging green alter ego The Hulk. Ruffalo adds an understated brilliance and goofy charm that humanizes. We really believe that he has made his peace and controlled the 'other guy'. Coulson calls upon Stark (Downey Jr.), who is in the midst of clean power sourcing his Stark Tower. Stark has a playful relationship with his partner Pepper Potts (funny and beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow). Too bad Paltrow isn't leveraged more in 'The Avengers'.Of course assembling a bunch of super powered heroes is not immediate team building. Whedon orchestrates spectacular clashes amongst themselves. Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America battling in the dark forest is visually stunning. The Hulk taking on Thor is wild and strangely comical. The Hulk gets the prize for his cage match with evil Loki. The audience exploded in applause. Ruffalo is amazing. His casual nerd nicely bonds with Downey Jr.'s impatient genius. Renner as Hawkeye is solid and edgy, and plays nice. Johansson looks awesome in the black body suit. Even more impressive she shades the darkness and nobility of Natasha. She has a killer scene with Hiddleston at the story arc.'The Avengers' delivers with the explosive visual spectacle as our heroes risk their lives battling the powerful aliens as they pulverize New York City. Whedon is masterful with the action and the characters. He makes us believe in heroes in 'The Avengers'.",10,18,35,7 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Fun Book of Secrets
","This time around in 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' Benjamin Gates (Nicholas Cage) and his father Patrick (Jon Voight) exonerate the good name of Great Grandfather Gates for the heinous assassination coup of Abraham Lincoln. Ed Harris's Mitch Wilkinson makes this startling allegation along with possessing incriminating evidence of a long held family letter. Also in prescribed convoluted fashion clearing the Gates family name explicably leads to the search for the mythical City of Gold thought to be built by Native American Ancestors. Go figure. Clues to The City of Gold are uncovered from the desks of the Queen of England and the Oval Office itself. The key to The City of Gold and the Lincoln Conspiracy is concealed in the ubiquitous Book of Secretsan urban legend of sorts. The Book of Secrets originated in the Hayes Administration, and consequently handed down to each succeeding President. Apparently, this Book documents all of our National Secrets running the gamut from Area 51 to the final Warren Commission Report. To obtain The Book of Secrets, Ben must kidnap the President of the United States. No problem.Director Jon Turteltaub's 'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' takes a while to throttle into overdrive, and it is the story set up that is most captivating. 'Book of Secrets' has one of the most complex writing credits involving The Wibberleys among at least 4 other writers. This kluge of writers wildly veers in story coherence; however, they context some of the most amazing facts from American history. Or at least I think they do. Then again this is an entertaining action movie, so pointing out this failing is rather pointless.Personally the highlight of the movie was not the chase car scenes or the deadly balancing stone platform, rather the conversation between Gates and the awesome Bruce Greenwood as the President in the hidden tunnels of Mount Vernon. Cage and Greenwood are compelling and smart in their discussion of The Book of Secrets. And as my bud Peter pointed out, there is perhaps a clue leading to the movie's sequel. The rest of 'Book of Secrets' is cookie cutter action albeit excellently executed. The acting is impeccable. Joining Oscar winners Cage and Voight is Helen Mirren as Professor Emily Appleton, who is Ben's mother. The scenes with Voight and Mirren are classic and amazing.Returning in 'Book of Secrets' are Diane Kruger as Abigail Chase and Justin Bartha as Riley Poole. Abigail (Chase) and Ben apparently did not live happily ever after since 'National Treasure'. We learn that Abigail has asked Ben to move out of their estate. Riley suffers an income tax debacle since obtaining his share of the last treasure. He has written a book of his exploits, but still remains in the shadow of big Ben. However, all band together to clear the Gates family name and determine the location of the mysterious City of Gold. Cage, Voight, Kruger, and Bartha are good here, but do not lend any insight or depth to their characters. Again, this may not have been a priority for this movie. Cage has the right balance of smart ass and hero that works. He does so with ease and humor. Jon Voight and Helen Mirren nearly steal the movie.'National Treasure: Book of Secrets' will not win any award. However, it is a wild ride, very entertaining, and visually stunning. Yes, it is needlessly convoluted. Just enjoy the ride.",8,39,65,28 December 2007
Blade Runner 2049," More than human...
","'Blade Runner 2049' is visually stunning like nothing you've been before with the opaque orange sky of the industrial ravaged future Earth, and its vivid gaudy neon holographic skyline at night. Director Denis Villeneuve and Executive Producer Ridley Scott, who directed the original 'Blade Runner', are more provocative inquiry, 'What is it to be human?' At a narrative arc Ryan Gosling's blue eyes widen welled with tears as his Replicant LAPD Officer K says, 'It's real!' K realizes that his implanted childhood memory is real. But whose is it? His? Villenueve and cinematographer Roger Deakins's 'Blade Runner 2049' is the masterfully sublime futuristic mural that unconceals the compelling and flawed inquiry of humanity in the screenplay by Hampton Francher and Michael Green, based on the Philip K. Dick novel. Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford as the returning aged Deckard are awesome. Gosling commands as K in his profound stillness and compassion which betrays his character's human design. He tells his LAPD superior Lt. Joshi, played by powerful Robin Wright, that being born gives one a soul. She acknowledges him, 'You've done just fine without one.' 'Blade Runner 2049' surprises, because of Gosling's courage in finding K's purpose, his soul. Gosling and Ford have amazing chemistry and partnership. Ford brings a world weary gravitas. K finally locates the recluse retired Blade Runner Deakard (Ford), who possesses vital information of this Replicant conspiracy and his own past. Deakard tells K, 'Sometimes when you love someone, you got to be a stranger.' What is real?Replicants are the synthetic genetically engineered humans, not born, created as the expendable work force. In 2049 Wallace Industries assumes the production of Replicants, who are designed with great physical strength and enhanced intellectual capacity. Jared Leto plays the enigmatic blind CEO Niander Wallace. Leto has the quiet, yet malevolent enlightened air. Wallace says, 'Every civilization was built on the back of a disposable workforce, but I can make only so many.' He arrogantly believes he is doing God's work. Blade Runners like K retire or kill rogue Replicants, who are deemed dangerous. Part of K's curse is that he too, is Replicant. '2049' opens as K tracks down Replicant agro farmer Sapper Morton, played by quiet hulking Dave Bautista. Their vicious battle reveals K's unique strength and resilience. However, this Replicant 'retirement' reveals the unheard of. There may exist, a child born of a Replicant mother. Lt. Joshi (Wright) has K pursue this investigation at Wallace Industries. K meets the forceful and beautiful Replicant Luv, played by astonishing charismatic Sylvia Hoeks, Wallace's executive in charge. K's questions threaten, and Luv surmises that K must be terminated. Villeneuve eloquently orchestrates their defining conflict. Inadvertently, Luv's reveal cues K to locate Deakard (Ford). In the backdrop, K lives the isolated existence. His love is the sad and beautiful holographic program Joi, played by captivating Ana de Armas. Joi is the sentient program wishing to be human to be with K. This is the weakest movie narrative. The virtual ménage of K, Joi, and Replicant prostitute Mariett, strong pretty Mackenzie Davis, is more a hollow plot device than about human frailty. Too bad. In the telling confession with Deakard and Wallace in his Zen-like lair, Wallace says to Deakard of his deceased Replicant love Rachel, 'Love or mathematical precision?' What is it to be human? That gets lost at times. As Luv, Hoek's consumed ruthlessness, fierce intellect, and spinning sidekicks provide the formidable match for Gosling's enduring warrior K. Luv's purpose is self preservation of her kind. K's purpose is far nobler. He searches for the truth, and protects those who are weaker. K may not be entirely human, yet he becomes Hero. This narrative thread and the performances make 'Blade Runner 2049' special. Aside from Harrison Ford, Carla Juri stands out as the gentle brilliant orphaned Scientist who created K's memories. She is bright light with a profound sadness. 'Blade Runner 2024' also has a sense of sadness which is its strength and poignancy. Villeneuve surprises in the end. Then we recall that even in the darkness, 'Blade Runner 2024' is the Hero story of K and Deakard. Gosling and Ford give their best here, and we are thankful, the better for it.",9,10,23,8 October 2017
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," True Super Woman
","Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' completes the 2 volume set that began last fall, and it is simply an amazing accomplishment. The movie is stunning, and is complete onto itself unlike for example, the individual Lord of the Rings movies. One need not have seen Vol. 1 to be enthralled by Vol. 2. Tarantino is a master of context. Vol. 2 even surpasses Vol. 1, largely because this movie is more story driven. Tarantino's screenplay (along with the credited Uma Thurman) breathes life into the characters of The Bride (Uma Thurman), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), especially Bill (wonderfully played by David Caradine), and clarifies the juxtaposed plot thread. The dialog has the signature Tarantino crisp, quirky, whacked sensibility. In Vol. 2 Uma Thurman emerges as a powerful and commanding screen presence, a true movie star, and a gifted actor. Tarantino provided the foundation of 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2', and Thurman gives it it's soul. When last we left off, the unnamed Bride killed off 2 members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Yes, she had left a trail of blood and body parts in the aftermath. Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) remain on her list before she kills Bill. Turns out that The Bride has a name that was actually revealed in Vol. 1-- left here unsaid. Also from Vol.1 we know that The Bride's child lives, and that Bill was named the father. So The Bride's path for revenge is no longer a straight line. First on her list is Budd, who is Bill's brother. Somehow during their encounter, The Bride ends up buried alive. But this is merely a vehicle for Tarantino's storytelling genius. The Bride recalls her training with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (a truly excellent Gordon Liu). Using humor and amazing kung fu technique, he reveals an axiom of mastery in the martial arts: First, one has to cop to the fact that he or she knows nothing. Secondly, whatever one already knows really means jack. Brilliant.Though Vol. 2 relies more on narrative and dialog, the action and fighting sequences are breathtaking. They are all brutal, though there is a distinct elegance inherent to them. The training sequences with Pai Mei and The Bride are visually stunning. The battle between Elle Driver and The Bride is captivating with a sense of style and humor (Driver is unable to draw her samurai sword, because they are fighting in a low ceiling trailer home). Daryl Hannah is smart, sexy, deadly, and totally hot. She is perfect as Elle. Both she and Thurman trained intensely to do what they did on screen. David Caradine is awesome as Bill. He is slick, cool, and flaunts this arrogant air of enlightenment. He has a classic scene with Tarantino's dialog, regarding his fascination of Super Heroes, particularly with Superman. According to Bill, Superman wakes up in the morning knowing that he is Superman-- his alter ego is Clark Kent who is weak. Bill's point is that The Bride is a natural born killer, and everything else is pretense. This punctuates that The Bride even in her singular mission of vengeance, is a hero. This is an acknowledgment of Uma Thurman's performance. Her Bride is so strong of sheer will and spirit, and at the same time she dismisses some of her humanity because it clouds her focus-- to kill Bill. Thurman is that rare combination of beauty, intelligence, power, grace, and vulnerability. Her performance as The Bride is like the perfect haiku-- it's poetry. 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is the best movie of the year, thus far. Tarantino is a master storyteller. Uma Thurman has become a powerful and completely captivating movie presence. She should continue to take on commanding movie roles. Vol. 2 is an awesome movie.",10,1,2,27 April 2004
Black Swan," Perfection, instead of Greatness
","'Black Swan' is macabre indulgent crap. Although exquisitely crafted, it's ultimately a waste of 2 hours. Director Darren Aronofsky's touch is so heavy handed and blunt in his tale of spiraling meltdown. Natalie Portman is powerful as Nina, and will win an Oscar. 'Black Swan' is classic tragedy, but lacks eloquence and resonance. Paradoxically, Aronofsky's sledgehammer like narrative overwhelms the elusive grace and refinement of ballet. I admired Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler', also a tale of deceptive physicality and discipline. However, something is amok here. Even as literal metaphor of 'Swan Lake', 'Black Swan' morphs as a very unpleasant experience. Portman's Nina hauntingly says, 'I just want to be perfect.' This echoes throughout as tortured obsession. Aside from the magnificent prowess of dance, the screenplay by Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, and John McLaughlin is unrelenting waves of corporeal rage and suffering. The hand held camera shots in 'Black Swan' give it a gritty and austere feel. Natalie Portman trained nearly 2 years to prepare for the role of Nina Sayers. Her protruding ribs in her breast are scary authenticity. Her gaunt persona captures the rigid and wounded spirited Nina, who is an impeccable technician, but fearful of risking the freedom of her art. As the story unfolds, perhaps her instincts were warranted. Portman is riveting and nuanced. She enrolls us into Nina's life despite Aronofsky's opaque narrative strokes. Nina suffers blistering nerve rashes and mangled toes. Nina is the dedicated ballerina, who is finally called to audition for the role of the Swan Queen in 'Swan Lake'. Director Thomas (darkly charming Vincent Cassel) knows that Nina can embody the White Swan, but questions whether she can summon the dark fire of the Black Swan. Thomas replaces his aging lover-- prima ballerina Beth (used and tragic Winona Ryder), in his envisioning of 'Swan Lake'. Nina is aware that she may be auditioning for more than just the lead. Her obsessive stage Mom Erica (dramatically taut Barbara Hershey), also fears the inevitable. Erica is eerily controlling, and as a former dancer proxies her life for her daughter Nina. Here Aronofsky brilliantly exposes Nina as one who forsakes greatness for perfection. However, I think he forfeits this thread in the catharsis. Enter Mila Kunis's Lily, the Black Swan of the tale. Lily is the talented untamed dancer, willing to risk all in life and in dance. Lily lacks the precision of Nina, but possesses unbridled passion and sensuality. Lily and Nina are logical rivals, and lyrical Yin and Yang of the same person. If you are a fan of YouTube, you are aware of their erotic Sapphic tryst. It is captivating; however, like much of 'Black Swan' this occurs as manipulation on the part of the director. The concluding arc of 'Black Swan' lost me. Half way through, we get that Nina is battling for her own sanity. To that end, Portman is amazing and displays poignant suffering and muted joy. The performances are grand. Cassel is creepy duplicity. Kunis is awesome as the maverick dancer living on the edge. I think 'Black Swan' fails despite great effort in exposing the perfection myth. Yes, perfection is manifested in youth, beauty, and talent. There is perfection in icons like James Dean and Bruce Lee. The tragedy of these icons was that the possibility of greatness was forsaken too soon. 'Black Swan' celebrates the pursuit of perfection, not the legacy of greatnessâ€”of altering and inspiring the world. Perfection is misguided and fleeting pursuit. Greatness is the game worth playing and living. 'Black Swan' seems to miss this distinction, and that is a little sad.",7,1,7,21 December 2010
Men in Black 3," Yes, Men in Black are Back!
","In 'Men in Black III' Will Smith's Agent J travels back in time to 1969 to prevent his beloved mentor Agent K, present day Tommy Lee Jones, from being murdered and avert the future destruction of the world from extraterrestrial invaders. Josh Brolin is awesome as the 29 year-old K, and younger version of Tommy Lee Jones. Brolin's performance authentically captures the Young K and essentially young Jones, in a way that is distinct homage and moving on its own right. His amazing performance wonderfully enrolls us in MIB3.Screenwriter Etan Cohen's story possesses an unsuspecting poignancy and narrative twist. In one of the best scenes, Young K (Brolin) quietly confesses to J (Smith) in his southern drawl, 'You're a good man.' J gets it, and you see this touchingly in Smith's eyes. Realizing that this K is not the gruff Jones K, he replies, 'What happened to you?' Will Smith is back in awesome form as J—all swagger, looking trim and fit in his black suit and tie. Smith is a master at balancing the smart ass bravado with palpable decency and humanity. Smith's historical sweet bromance with Jones transforms into something special with Brolin. That coherence solidifies Director Barry Sonnenfeld and Cohen's vision. I had seen an interview with Will Smith on 'Good Morning America', where he said that he came up with the idea of MIB3 when they were filming MIB2 10 years ago. He wanted to connect up all 3 movies in some catharsis.Don't misunderstand: 'Men in Black 3' is hysterical, and action packed with ray guns vaporizing dozens of evil aliens. I didn't opt for the 3D, given that the movie was post production 3D. Though it is visually stunning with the retro 1969 MIB look, and the cool motorcycle chases.Cohen's writing is a brilliant mix of hysterical and subtle gravitas. Back in 1969, Andy Warhol is really Men in Black Agent W, played with comic genius by Bill Hader. While Young K and J talk with Warhol (Harder) about killer alien Boris, he tells his assistant, 'I'm taking a picture of a man eating a hamburger that is so transcendent' I was laughing so hard. Back at headquarters, J tells Young K, 'A wise man once told me, don't ask a question, you don't want an answer to.' Brolin says, 'I said that?' Smith and Brolin's partnership has a genuine worn comfortable feel. Just watch Young K order pie with J at a local diner—Smith and Brolin are hilarious.The Men in Black (MIB) is a super secret organization that keeps peace in the world with the coexistence of alien beings and humans on Earth. Some of the aliens are people we know like Lady Gaga. Since the last movie, compassionate and strong Emma Thompson as Agent O is the new Leader of MIB. Thompson is great—too bad she isn't leveraged more. J discerns that the cantankerous K may have had a past romantic relationship with O. Anyway, as MIB3 opens one armed murderous alien Boris The Animal (comically hideous Jermaine Clement), breaks out of the convert lunar penitentiary. He aims to exact revenge on K (Jones), who shot off his arm and imprisoned him, by traveling back in time and killing him.J (Smith) distinguishes something awry in this current alternate reality, where K was never his partner. Agent O helps J isolate the glitch. Apparently, K was killed over 40 years ago in an attempt to avert a world crisis. So it is up to J to go back in time and set things right by killing Boris. However, back in 1969 J and Young K befriend alien ally Griffin (innocent and gentle Michael Stuhlbarg), who cryptically warns J that death can only replace death.Granted there are way too many aliens on the verge of distraction, and a lot of visual eye candy in 'Men in Black 3'. What keep us engrossed are the human characters and bating narrative—what is the source of J and K's relationship? Josh Brolin is the amazing standout. Will Smith has the star charisma to be in flow, and be the cohesive force in this funny and strangely touching tale. MIB3 may be a great as the first movie, and I hope they make MIB4. I think this story is worth continuing.",9,2,8,29 May 2012
Frost_Nixon," Innocence Lost
","At the telling juncture of Director Ron Howard's 'Frost/Nixon', Michael Sheen's David Frost asks, 'Are you saying that the President can do something illegal?' Frank Langella's Richard Nixon emphatically replies, 'I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's not illegal!' Powerful scene. Power corrupts, absolutely. Frank Langella is amazing as former President Nixonhis nomination is so deserved.Ron Howard is at the top of his game; telling the story of 1977 David Frost interviews with former President Richard Nixon, forced to resign the Presidency following the Watergate scandal from the screenplay and play by Peter Morgan. I had watched the Frost/ Nixon interviews as teen, but their significance escaped me at the time. 'Frost/Nixon' is solid story telling. The performances by Michael Sheen as David Frost and Langella as Nixon are stellar. However, as well crafted and expertly told by Howard, 'Frost/Nixon' is very linear in naturegranted this is historical. And the story arc catharsis is the possibility of compassion for Nixon as a man, who sold out on his beliefs and his very soul.What Howard and Morgan do poignantly is depict Nixon as not an evil man, rather a tragic man, who was so blinded by his power. I think that is really closer to what was so. There is a surprisingly touching scene where empathetic Frost (Sheen) asks whether Nixon realizes that he has 'done something that will haunt you for the rest of your life' The resolute Nixon says, 'I let the American people down' Although story and dramatic arc are linear in nature, my bud John pointed out that 'Frost/Nixon' like the actual interviews themselves captures the tragic loss of innocence of our nation. The Nixon impeachment and resignation indelibly punctuated the end of 'Camelot'. And perhaps, the nation never recovered from this loss of innocence. This is strangely relevant today, as we question the use of absolute power even under the noblest intentions. In retrospect Ron Howard has done amazing, and culturally important work here.The performances are great throughout. Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell are solid as Frost's research staff, Bob Zelnick and James Reston. Rebecca Hall is enchanting as Caroline Cushing as the right girlfriend at the right time. Matthew Macfadyen is compassionate and strong as Frost's conscience and producer John Birt. Michael Sheen is amazing. David Frost was almost a glorified game show-like talk show host, whose final redemption was the Nixon interviews. Sheen is charming and light, and hints at the underlying power that will arise above the superfluous, and embrace greatness. Kevin Bacon is awesome as Nixon loyal Jack Brennen. Langella defines 'Frost/Nixon'. He is such a powerful actor and presence. Here he is Macbeth. His is never a caricature of Nixon, instead a sad and tragic man who finally gets his place in history. And it haunted him for the rest of his days. 'Frost/Nixon' is tragic, sad, and so compelling.",10,1,3,14 February 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Incredible Movie
","Poised in a helicopter high above the city, prepared to risk perhaps certain death in saving it, Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) tells the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler), 'Betty, I've gotta try' 'The Incredible Hulk' is the compelling hero story reinvented with a yearning love story in the foreground. The action is visually enthralling, and the Hulk himself is amazingly ferocious with ripped muscles and veins. Unlike the previous incarnation, 'The Incredible Hulk' has a sense of humanity and pathos. Director Louis Leterrier (of the 'Transporter' movies) and Writer Zak Penn (of the 'X-Men' movies) have reinvented 'The Incredible Hulk' as an exploration into the darkness of human nature all in the context of a brilliantly orchestrated action movie. Understandably, 'The Incredible Hulk' is based on a comic book which had the pretense of retelling the story of 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'. However, there is something noble in Bruce Banner's (Norton) journey to control the great anger and power within himselfThe Hulk. In that regard-- Edward Norton is powerful. His compelling performance humanizes and breathes compassion for a man coming to terms with his own darkness. Thankfully, those who saw Ang Lee's 'Hulk' can finally forgive the sins of the predecessor.Leterrier and Penn's story begins with Banner in self-imposed seclusion in Rio de Janeiro. Recall that scientist Bruce Banner exposed himself to gamma rays as part of experiments for the military. However, something went horribly wrong during a transient gamma ray exposure. Under great duress or anger Bruce transforms into the green skinned beastThe Hulk. The Hulk is a seemingly mindless enigma of rage and destruction. Bruce must find a cure for his affliction. In Brazil, Bruce may have made peace with the raging beast within. He meditates. He trains with his Brazilian Jujitsu Sensei (martial arts great Rickson Gracie) to find his path. Sensei tells Bruce, 'To control your anger, you must control your body.' Bruce works odd jobs at a bottling factory, while researching his own cure. His only regret in self imposed exile was forsaking his true love, Betty Ross (Tyler).While Bruce may have found some peace the world, the rest of the world will not let him be. In particular, General 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt), who regards Bruce as missing government property, is determined to hunt Bruce and The Hulk down. Even Bruce realizes that he inadvertently participated in a covert 'weapon' conspiracy. General Ross enlists the talents of expert soldier Emil Blonsky (cold blooded Tim Roth). The singular focused and ambitious Emil is not entirely what he seems. Realizing he is overmatched in capturing The Hulk, Emil willingly volunteers for an experimental 'super soldier' program, so he can engage The Hulk. This of course leads to the unexpected outcome: The Abominationa creature perhaps stronger than The Hulk.The battle scenes with General Ross's army and The Hulk are visually stunning-- thunderous mayhem. Leterrier gets his job done. The battle between The Hulk and The Abomination is dramatic spectacle. My bud Ron, pointed out that their battle is reminiscent in scale of Godzilla, but sans the camp. Through all this Liv Tyler as Betty grounds the story with an emotional resonance. There is a quietly touching moment when Betty distinguishes Bruce in a bar and a great scene when she embraces Bruce in the down pouring rain. Edward Norton's quiet power is the soul of 'The Incredible Hulk'. Liv Tyler is its heart. She brilliantly captures Betty's resounding regret, knowing she can never be with the man she loves. Edward Norton embodies the hero's courage and nobility. He is awesome. Also amazing is William Hurt as General Ross, who will sacrifice his very humanity and family to obtain his objective. Hurt brings a keen focus and unmatched duplicity.Amidst the epic scale action, 'The Incredible Hulk' tells the compelling story of a man's search for peace within himselfthe noblest of pursuits. Leterrier and Penn reinvent a classic hero tale. Edward Norton is powerful and amazing. 'The Incredible Hulk' is a great movie.",10,4,7,17 June 2008
Miracle," A Time for Greatness
","'Miracle' is truly an inspiring and uplifting movie. As trite as it may sound, Director Gavin O'Connor and Writer Eric Guggenheim's 'Miracle' celebrates the triumph of the human spirit. The storytelling by O'Connor and Guggenheim, along with Kurt Russell's commanding performance eloquently distinguishes greatness distinct from excellence. Excellence is the conversation around talent, training, and pedigree. Greatness starts with heart. Coaching for greatness is the only game whether it is sports or... in life. Given that movies are the profound medium of this generation, a movie like 'Miracle' that inspires, and asks people accept or reclaim their own greatness is such a breath of fresh air in the current climate of 'credible'- 'Life sucks' motion pictures.Kurt Russell plays 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Teach Coach, Herb Brooks. In 1979 Brooks became the Olympic Team Coach-- after winning 3 NCAA titles as the coach at the University of Minnesota. He assembles a team of 20 to 22 year-old collegians to take on the Best in the World-- the Russian Olympic Team. I was unaware of this when I was watching the Winter Games in 1980. The Russian Team had won the Gold Medal in '64, '68, '72, and '76. They destroyed the NHL All-Star Team at Madison Square Garden in 1979. They were the World's Greatest Hockey Team. Brooks didn't make the final cut for U.S. Team which last beat the Russians in 1960. What Brooks and his young men accomplished in the Winter Games of 1980 was a miracle. Though as we watch this story unfold as told by O'Connor, what happens is not unthinkable.We are clued from the beginning what Brooks (Russell) is about, when he selects his team on the basis of one day of try-outs. He tells his assistant Craig Patrick (a solid ' good cop' Noah Emmerich), 'I'm not looking for the best players... I'm looking for the right players.' 20 players make the final team. Like the 1980 Team, two standout: Goalie Jim Craig (a strong internalized Eddie Cahill) and Team Captain Mike Eruzione (a spirited Patrick O'Brien Demsey). Craig (Cahill) is fulfilling the dreams of his late mother, and enduring the financial hardships of his family. He still suffers from his loss, and looks to resurrect the greatness that Brooks sees in him.Ultimately, this story is about Coach Brooks. This works, because there are way too many characters (as good as the performances are). Kurt Russell's performance is powerful. Patricia Clarkson creates the role of his wife Patty as a focal point, in what could have been an after thought in less capable hands. Her Patty is Herb's rock, and will not take any crap from him when she reminds him of his responsibilities as a husband and father. She is tough, and his inspiration.What makes Brooks' story so moving and touching is that he is really about having his 20 and 22 year-olds become great men. He tells them, 'I am your coach. I am not your friend.' He demands from them more than they think they have to give, because his listening for them is much bigger than their own. That is a great coach. There is a stunning scene, after his team ties the Norwegian National Team-- coasting through. He makes the entire team run speed drills after the game until they drop. He reminds them, 'Win, lose, or tie. You WILL play like champions!' No team has ever had the endurance to skate all 4 periods with the Russian. Brooks is a demand for his men to do the impossible. It's about heart. Russell has a moving scene with his wife before the medal round match with the Soviets. He tells Patty what he wants is that '20 years from now these guys will look back and know that they left nothing on the table, that they gave it their all.' Before the game Brooks makes his team choose greatness or... not. He tells them, if the played the Russians 10 times, the Russians would win 9. 'But not today... Today you are a great team.' 'This is your time...''Miracle' is awesome. Kurt Russell gives the performance of his career. His Brooks is an authentic demand for greatness and ruthless compassion. The movie is also a tribute to a great man, the late Herb Brooks. During the closing credits, the actors playing each of 1980 Olympic Team members are acknowledged along with a short summary on what that member is doing today. They all have outstanding lives. So it was not only a Miracle in 1980, but also a life lesson. Brooks has an enduring legacy. 'Miracle' is a great movie about the greatness in all of us. Thank you-- Gavin, Eric, Kurt, and crew. You have made a very special movie that moves, touches, and inspires.",10,0,0,8 February 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Mission Intense
","In the opening scene of 'Mission: Impossible III', a tortured and bound Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) screams at the villainous Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman),'  I swear to God, I will kill you!' Davian is about to kill someone beloved to Ethan. First time feature Director J.J. Abrams ('Alias' and 'Lost') starts full throttle showcasing the sheer intensity of Cruise and Hoffman at the emotional arc. Both Cruise and Hoffman are two of the screen's most intense and driven actors. This dynamic along with the awe inspired stunts fuels 'Mission: Impossible III' emerging as a great action thriller. This time around MI:3 is more personal, and generates an emotional investment in it's characters. In the screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Abrams, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is now a retired operative who trains recruits for the IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Kurtzman, Orci, and Abrams also employ an effective narrative device by opening in the middle of the story, then retracing their path.No longer in the Game, Ethan has found the love of his life Julia (Michelle Monaghan). They have plans to marry. Julia is a doctor, who has no idea who Ethan really is. Ethan's story is that he works for the Department of Transportation as a traffic planner. Apparently, saving the world from global terrorism is in his past-- until Ethan receives a call from IMF supervisor John Musgrave (mysterious Billy Crudup) during his and Julia's engagement party. Apparently, Ethan's star student, Lindsey Ferris (Keri Russell), is missing in action. Lindsey was to uncover the covert operation lead by the deadly international arms dealer Davian (Hoffman). Davian covets an omnipotent weapon called the 'rabbit's foot'. The 'rabbit's foot' refers to the mythological 'anti-god' weapon. Ethan's mission: Retrieve Lindsey and reveal the whereabouts of the 'rabbit's foot'.Ethan accepts the mission and reunites with best bud Luther Strickell (Ving Rhames), along with new members Declan (charismatic Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and Zhen (stunning and deadly Maggie Q). In the spectacular ensuing operation, things go horribly wrong. Politically savvy IMF Director John Brassel (the great Laurence Fishburne) chastises Ethan and crew for the rash operation. Their new mission targets Davian directly and obtaining the 'rabbit's foot'. There are also hints of a conspiracy from within.Once Abrams sets the stage for his story, MI:3 floors into overdrive with non-stop thrills, world class action sequences, and gripping emotion. Ultimately, MI:3 is a conflict of vengeance between Ethan (Cruise) and Davian (Hoffman). In the balance of this outcome is Julia (Monaghan), the love of Ethan's life. Consequently, this installment of 'Mission: Impossible' is the most effective and most gratifying. Director and writer Abrams masterfully orchestrates the visuals and action sequences. Those familiar with the movie trailer saw Cruise bouncing of a car from an exploding missile, and Cruise's free fall dive from a skyscraper is heart stopping. Though what really distinguishes MI:3 is the underlying love story and the dynamic hero and villain conflict embodied by Cruise and Hoffman. 'Mission: Impossible III' works as personal story of extremes: love versus revenge.Philip Seymour Hoffman is surprising, powerful, and commanding as the merciless and venomous Owen Davian. Surprising in that this is such a departure from his Academy Award Winning performance in 'Capote'. Hoffman creates in Davian, a villain whose malevolence is almost visceral. Tom Cruise is his match in intensity. Cruise as Ethan Hunt is powerful, and his intensity and innate charisma serve him well here. As Ethan, Cruise is the classic hero: strong, determined, brave, and compassionate. Cruise performed almost all of his own stunts. Whether he uses martial arts skills to dispatch bad guys or is hurling to the streets on a failed parachute, he displays amazing physicality and spirit. Cruise seems to remain ageless. Michelle Monaghan is captivating and vulnerable as Julia. Keri Russell is very strong as Lindsey. Laurence Fishburne is so effective in a deceiving role as Brassel. Ving Rhames is Ethan's rock. Rhames commands a quite power. Though his Luther should have gotten more screen time, he grounds MI:3 .Abram's 'Mission: Impossible III' is spectacular and stunning eye candy with its mind blowing action and international locales. Although it is its classic story of the forces of good versus the forces of great evil that compel, and for that acknowledge the talents of Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman. At its heart MI:3 is also a love story that provides its emotional stake. MI:3 is well worth watching.",9,2,4,6 May 2006
War Dogs," Not Illegal
","In 'War Dogs', Jonah Hill's Efraim says, 'Just because it's not legal, doesn't make it illegal.' Director and writer Todd Philip's 'War Dogs' is smart, hysterical, and ultimately sad. It is based on a true story about two twenty-somethings (Miles Teller and Jonah Hill), who win a $300 million U.S. Government contract to supply arms in the War in Afghanistan. Phillips wrote the screenplay with Stephen Chin and Jason Smilovic based on a 'Rolling Stone' article by Guy Lawson. The bizarre truth trumps fiction. During the Bush Administration, the 'Cheney Law' allowed for small independent contractors to bid on U.S. Government armament contracts. Often these contracts were for weapons that were illegal or not readily obtained. So essentially the system is rigged; it encouraged entrepreneurs to leverage the heavy lifting of the arms black market. The Government doesn't care as long as they get their weapons, but just don't get caught. This is a big 'but'.Phillips brilliantly captures with hypocrisy and whimsy the turmoil engulfing his guys, David (Teller) and Efraim (Hill). The dudes openly chose this work, and the possible consequences. However, the money is not easy to dismiss. In an Albanian warehouse David and Efraim verify that the $100,000 additional cost will result in $3 million more profit. Hill provides the right arrogance and paranoia in Efraim, who loves living large. Teller reminds of a young John Cusack. He is the decent everyday man caught up in overwhelming circumstance. Teller as David is knowingly seduced by the dark side, and he shows remnants of his noble conscience. Here that makes a difference for us. David is also beholding to Iz (solid Ana de Armas), his girl friend and mother of their child. Iz seems to believe whatever benefits herâ€”perplexing to David. Bradley Cooper has a showcase role as slick arms dealer Henry Girard. Cooper amazingly balances Henry's ruthlessness offset with a weird code of honor. Cooper's performance punctuates a theme of the movie that things are not always what they seem. 'War Dogs' is visually stunning. There are magnificent aerial shots of the Jordan desert as the dudes cross the 'Triangle of Death' to deliver Berettas in Iraq. The scenes in dark and cold Albania express the starkness and emptiness of the mood. The visuals enhance the exacting details of Phillip's story. Predictably, 'War Dogs' is a cautionary tale. However, it is told with wit, humor, and a sense of compassion. The hypocrisy lies within the system. And here are two guys making a fortune. Teller, Hill, and Cooper are great. 'War Dogs' is worth a watch and more thought.",8,0,1,28 August 2016
The Hangover," 'The Hangover' Sustains Greatness
","In the opening of 'The Hangover', in the middle of the Mohave Desert, Bradley Cooper's haggard Phil calls Doug's fiancée Tracy (Sasha Barrese) to inform her that they have 'lost' Doug (Justin Bartha). Distressed Tracy reminds Phil that they are getting married in 5 hours. Phil replies, 'Yeah that's not going to happen.' Director Todd Phillips's 'The Hangover' is the funniest movie of the year. And the story by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is brilliantly hysterical.The premise is outrageous. In a Las Vegas bachelor party completely gone awry, a group of buddies wake up the next morning to discover their Caesar's Palace suite demolished, with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby, but missing the groom Doug (Bartha). Phil (Cooper) has sore ribs and a hospital wristband. Dentist Stu (funny Ed Helms from 'The Office') is bloodied and missing a tooth. Tracy's brother Alan (wacked out Zach Galifanakis) is sans pants. All three have no clue what happened in the previous 10 hours, when they lost Doug. The last thing they basically remember is making a toast with Alan's Jaeger Meister. Phil, Stu, and Alan must pool their damaged resources and return Doug for his wedding back in Los Angeles.The defining moment of 'The Hangover' comes when the crew watches a surveillance video with Mike Tyson at his home. Mike asks, 'You guys stole a police car?' Stu sheepishly cops to this. Mike high fives saying, 'Nice!' Later after watching the entire debacle on tape, Phil apologizes to Tyson. Mike says, 'We do dumb sh**, when we're f***ed up.' That pretty much sums up Todd Phillips's 'The Hangover'. It is a hysterical ride, and ultimately all plausible. Make sure to stay through the credits of the movie. Bradley Cooper as ring leader Phil is going to be a star. He is tall, handsome, and has great comedic timing. Cooper also is the surprising solid one, who literally rolls with the punches. Ed Helms is the brilliantly unglued Stu, who is about marry his bitch girl friend Melissa (taut and scary Rachael Harris). Zach Galifianakis is initially warped creepy as Alan. He points out to Doug when they pick up teacher Phil that he can't be within 200 feet of a school or a Chuck E Cheese. Galifianakis effectively morphs into a lovable loner. Justin Bartha nails the straight man Doug. He is so comfortable being with funny, which is not easy.While blitzed out his mind Stu marries big hearted stripper/ escort Jade (stunning and hysterical Heather Graham). Graham is amazing and beautifully lends 'The Hangover' its deceptive charm. With all the high jinx including being attacked by a naked Chinese mobster Mr. Chow (funny Ken Jeong) wielding a crow bar or being stun-gunned by kids in the police station demonstration, 'The Hangover' is all fun and never mean spirited. Writers Lucas and Moore craft a hilarious tale that is strangely plausible, and really about heart-felt friendship. Granted there are more hysterical moments that should not be missed. What I really appreciated about 'The Hangover' is its spirit and sense of fun. 'The Hangover' is one the funniest movies around.",10,5,10,11 June 2009
Iron Man 3," Creating Our Heroes
","Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark ominously echoes, ' We create our own demons.' Director and Writer Shane Black takes a decidedly dark real world turn in 'Iron Man 3'. Black and co-writer Drew Pearce transform the hero's journey from the inside out all in the realm of global terrorism. In 'Iron Man 3' Iron Man, Tony Stark exacts vengeance and justice against the megalomaniac Mandarin (measured charismatic evil Ben Kingsley), who harms those he loves. The Mandarin is the sociopath anarchist, who seemingly wants to watch the world burn. In the wake of the Boston Marathon tragedy, 'Iron Man 3' assumes an eerie resonance. So if we create our own demons, can we also destroy our own demons—our fears? Shane Black and Robert Downey Jr. explore with gravitas and gratifying sense of humor. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. Downey still masterfully exudes billionaire Tony Stark's charming narcissistic genius blazing through Black and Pearce's crisp dialogue. In a hysterical scene he tells young charge Harley (scene stealing Ty Simpkins), whose Dad went to the store and never came back, 'Don't be such a p***y.' Downey has the amazing gift of letting us know what he is thinking. I really loved the movie, because he makes us see that Tony is the transcendent hero even without the high tech armor. Downey's Tony is haunted by the thwarted Alien invasion from 'The Avengers' movie. He can't sleep. He has debilitating anxiety attacks. And in his manic streaks advances the Iron Man suit technology. There is a cool sequence as Stark summons elements of the suit to his body. Downey displays his Chaplin-like physical acting gifts. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as the beautiful and grounded Pepper Potts, who is CEO of Stark Industries. She has moved into Tony's Cliffside Malibu home. Tony is suffering, and Pepper takes the brunt of the collateral damage. Happy (funny and aloof Jon Favreau, also Director of the first two movies) has transitioned from Tony's Chauffeur to anal Head of Security at Stark Industries. Tony's buddy Col. James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is PC version Iron Patriot. We create our own demons. In 1999, Tony attended a Conference in Bern, Switzerland. He cozies up to brilliant sexy Maya Hansen (smart and strong Rebecca Hall). Maya has discovered a process to regenerate plants in this case marijuana. However, the downside is that the regeneration is unstable and literally explosive. Tony blows off enamored fan crippled Aldrich Killian (deceptively diminished Guy Pearce), who has a proposal from AIM. New Year's Day finds Maya alone in bed and Aldrich in the cold. Aldrich as the now buff and handsome Guy Pearce reappears in 2012 meeting with Pepper. Pearce exudes a charming arrogance and power. His company AIM has Extremis, a regenerating healing biotech that he proposes to Stark Industries development. Pepper declines the easily weaponized app. The Mandarin unleashes his anarchist terrorism upon the President and invariably upon Tony. 'Do you want an empty life or a meaningful death?' Enraged Tony challenges the Mandarin, 'I'm not afraid of you! I know you're a coward.' The Mandarin sends a helicopter kill team across the Malibu shores. This is reminiscent of Black's 'Lethal Weapon'. The carnage is spectacular. Tony protects Pepper, and somehow manages to get to Tennessee. There he hooks up with whiz kid Harley (Simpkins) to investigate the source of the terror, as Tony battles his own demons without the protection of Iron Man. Everyone in 'Iron Man 3' is yoked out. Downey looks to have injured his hand early on wearing a brace. He is muscular and strong. He gets to use his Wing Chun expertise in a lot of the fight sequences. Don Cheadle exposes his biceps. Gwyneth Paltrow looks amazing, and shows off her shredded abs. Guy Pearce looks like he worked out with Hugh Jackman. Ultimately, the dark hero narrative culminates in the climatic showdown at shipyard, out of 'Lethal Weapon 2' as opposed to world destruction of 'The Avengers'. A welcome departure. The pivotal plot twist works, but for me dilutes the gravity of the emotional threat. The action sequences are amazing. The aerial rescue from Air Force One is visually stunning. Robert Downey Jr. makes us believe in heroes. We create our own demons. Heroes do what must be done, in spite of their demons, and inspire others to do the same. 'Iron Man 3' is a great movie.",10,6,15,7 May 2013
United 93," True Heroes
","Timing is everything. Much of the criticism of 'United 93' does not pertain to the movie itself, rather its timing. Is America or the world for that matter ready for a movie about 9/11? I think there is always a time for and need for stories of ordinary people who become great heroes. I think that Paul Greengrass's 'United 93' is a very powerful and moving motion pictureby far the year's Best. What also makes it unsettling is the beginning of the movie is so unnerving, because we all know how it all ends. 'United 93' is about heroes arising in chaos, not so much a lost cause act or one of desperation, rather people taking action out of courage and a commitment to do what is right. Greengrass's story inspires and touches one's very soul. Part of the experience for me was that of anger and my disgust for bulliesalthough the hijackers are jihad or holy warriors (in their minds), they are bullies. And like most 'bullies' they ultimately face people who reclaim their nobility and courage as heroes taking a stand. My guy says in the movie, ' I don't care if it (the bomb) is real, I'm going to break his f--king hand!' Greengrass, an acclaimed TV documentary filmmaker, employs a similar style and look in 'United 93'. The movie is unplugged and powerful. I had read that Director Greengrass chose for the most part unrecognizable actors so as to focus attention on the story. As an ensemble the cast is phenomenal. In the story 9/11 begins as any other day at the airport. However, we see Ziad Jarrah (an excellent Khalid Abdallah) and his men prepare for their suicide mission. They among the other 40 passengers and crew board United Flight 93 bound for San Francisco. Ben Sliney plays himself as FAA head during this recreation of the events of 9/11. He is an amazing man who turns in an outstanding performance. Three other planes were hijacked for terrorist attack. The FAA slowly uncovers this terrorist attack as the four planes one by one disappear off the transponder grid. It also turns out that on September 11, NORAD was conducting a large scale exercise. After the first airliner crashed into the World Trade Center, the havoc surrounded FAA jurisdiction and NORAD command strategy and privilege. Only the President can authorize an Air Force 'kill' operation over US air space, and the President was not immediately reachable. Also NORAD has well defined strategy for outside threats, but little in terms of internal domestic attacks. Ziad and his men take control of United 93 armed with box cutters and using the threat of plastic explosive bomb. Their mission target is the White House. Using the on-board phone it soon becomes apparent to passenger Thomas Burnett (solid and strong Christian Clemenson) that Flight 93 is on a suicide mission. He along with Mark Bingham (quiet and powerful Cheyenne Jackson), the rest of the passengers and crew realize that they must rush the cockpit and regain control of the plane. 'United 93' leaves an indelible mark in our conscience. The passengers on United 93 know in all likelihood that they are going to die. While they make plans for their last stand, people call loved ones to say good bye for the last time. The experience is heart-wrenching and humbling. I wonder in such a situation knowing that I were going to die, and what there was to do was fight to the very end if I would be as brave. The people on Flight 93 made that choice, and were amazing heroes. Perhaps that is some consolation to the loved ones and family members they left behind. The passengers of United Flight 93 embodied all that is brave and noble. They shall always be remembered. Paul Greengrass honors both their selfless action and legacy in 'United 93'. 'United 93' is at times difficult to watch, and should be seen.",10,1,3,1 May 2006
Minority Report," Choice or Conspiracy?
","Steven Spielbergs's 'Minority Report' is a visual and technical masterpiece, with great action, with an awesome movie star and actor in Tom Cruise at the top of his game, that somehow fails to deliver in the end. Give 'Minority Report' it's due, it is a wild ride. However, it is long at 2 1/2 hours. The year is 2054, and Spielberg captures a viable world, specifically Wasington, D.C., where there have been no murders in 6 years due to the efforts of the Pre-Crime Unit headed by Cruise's John Anderton. The screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen based on the Philip K. Dick short story is fascinating and poses some worthwhile questions. In 2054, there are 'Precogs'-- tech for pre-cognizants-- who foresee premeditated or passionate murders up to 36 hours before they are to happen. So it is the Pre-Crime units job to prevent the murders from happening, by arresting the 'murderer'. One now asks: If that person does not murder the victim or isn't even aware that he or she intends to, then how can they be guilty, much less punished? We don't get to dwell in the inquiry. However, the question becomes very real for Anderton (Cruise)when he discovers that he is to murder a man he doesn't even know, Leo Crow, within 36 hours. There are 3 Precogs, the most talented of the three is Agatha (a very good Sammantha Morton). Apparently, in the cases where all three do not agree on a foretold murder, a Minority Report is filed. The Report is in Agatha, and Anderton must uncover the truth-- whatever that may be. The chase is on. Meanwhile, a government agent is sent to audit the process to see if the program can go nationwide. This is headed by Danny Witwar, a deceptively competent character, well played by Colin Farrell. There are some great effects: futuristic car chases, crashing jet packs, and robotic spiders. Though the biggest asset is Tom Cruise. Cruise is so intense, and it is amazing how his Anderton stays so intense. He looks great, and does all the action sequences expertly. With Cruise, one gets a sense of his drive, and also the burnout. He makes Anderton very human and empathetic. It is also refreshing to see Cruise not playing a character who is incomplete with his father, instead he plays an incomplete father. He does it well. Sammantha Morton as Agatha has some excellent scenes-- a solid performance. All this is what makes 'Minority Report' disappointing in the end. The movie sets itself as a character play of fate, looking at the nature of true choice. However, what occurs instead of choice is conspiracy in a very long drawn conclusion. This does not give anything away. But the story and movie sells out the efforts of Cruise as Anderton, and perhaps the the value of the inquiry itself which made the movie so compelling from the start.Cruise and Spielberg have pooled their great talents together, and made a movie well worth seeing. Though ultimately there is no choice. And that is disappointing.",8,2,5,10 December 2004
Finding Neverland," Just Believe
","I finally saw Director Marc Forster's 'Finding Neverland' on DVD. It is an absolutely wonderful movie that is so very touching. It is a great movie. It was one of the best movies of 2004-- very deserving of its Academy Award nominations. Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie, author of 'Peter Pan', is simply awesome. Depp again demonstrates that he is the most gifted and versatile actor of his generation. Depp has this mercurial air about him, and is so present in every scene-- he is just being. There is a breathtaking scene half way through 'Neverland', where young George expresses concern about his Mother (Kate Winslet), and Barrie (Depp) acknowledges George (a very good Nick Rod) for becoming a young man right before his eyes, '...The boy is gone. In just the last 30 seconds...' Young Freddie Highmore as Peter Davies, the muse of Peter Pan, is amazing. Peter's on screen relationship with James Barrie is deeply compassionate and inspiring, and makes 'Finding Neverland' a very special movie and experience.Screen writer David Magee's 'Finding Neverland' is based on the play by Allan Knee, 'The Man Who Was Peter Pan'. Magee's words are equally magical. 'Neverland' tells the story of how J.M. (James) Barrie created Peter Pan in 1904. Barrie (Depp) at the time was a renowned play-write, who is in the midst of a dry spell. He along with his benefactor and producer, Charles Frohman (Dustin Hoffman, who injects a great light touch), have weathered a stage flop. Barrie must create something that audiences will embrace. Barrie develops a relationship with a widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), and her four young boys, George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Peter (Freddie Highmore), and Michael (Luke Spill). Barrie is married, and his wife Mary (a good Radha Mitchell) is not pleased that her husband is spending all his time with another family. Though their marriage seems to have died years ago. Also displeased is Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie). By Barrie spending so much time with the family, Sylvia's value is depreciated. In a more contemporary sense people start talking about Barrie, in particular his spending time with the Davies boys. There is a strange and unintentional allusion to Michael Jackson, a Peter Pan fan, but that goes no further.Barrie notices that Peter, who is at first resistant to him, seems in a hurry to grow up, thinking that things are less painful as an adult. Peter has taken the death of his father especially hard. In a stirring scene with Barrie, Peter tells him that he will not tolerate adults 'lying' to him. That had happened with his father. Kate Winslet plays the strong Sylvia who is keeping her family together, and at the same time battling her mother (Christie) for her sons' futures. Kate also guards a secret. Julie Christie is a excellent as Emma du Maurier-- she is not at all what she first appears to be. This in part illustrates what is so special about 'Finding Neverland'-- it celebrates the very best in people. Freddie Highmore is the standout as Peter, though the rest of the Davies boys are amazing and such mature performers.The last 20 minutes of 'Finding Neverland' is so very touching and inspiring. I now will read Barrie's 'Peter Pan'. I finally got that 'Peter Pan' is not just a fairy tale, rather a metaphor. We all grow old, in this we don't have a choice in the matter. However, if a part of us remains young, the part that makes the world always new and miraculous, not necessarily believing in fairies, rather remembering what that was like, then we grow old, without being truly old. Maybe that is finding Neverland. Barrie says to Peter at the end, 'Just believe.' That is well said. Forster and Depp have made something very special here, and have also made a bold request of the audience in 'Finding Neverland'. Just believe.",10,8,11,27 March 2005
Kung Fu Panda," Panda Awesomeness
","In the climactic kung fu battle wannabe 'Dragon Warrior' Tai Lung gazes upon the sacred Dragon Scroll which reveals the secret of Martial Arts Mastery and Power, and is left chagrined and perplexed. Panda Po (Jack Black) hysterically admits to the evil and powerful Snow Leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), 'I didn't get it the first time either' Jack Black is awesome as the kung fu Panda in Directors Mark Osbourne and John Stevenson's 'Kung Fu Panda'one of the best movies of the year so far. 'Kung Fu Panda' is definitely one of the funniest and most entertaining movies in a long while. Screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glen Berger, and Storywriters Ethan Reiff and Cyrus Vows' 'Kung Fu Panda' has an inspiring and familiar message. Even in its familiarity and crisp spot on humor, 'Kung Fu Panda' is surprisingly touching. After all, this is an unlikely hero's transformation tale. At the story arc Po confesses to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), 'If there is anyone who could... make me, not me'it is Shifu. 'Kung Fu Panda' also gets it right for the story of martial arts mastery, and perhaps mastery as a whole. This is refreshing and is also a great message for kidsas trite as that sounds.Fat slacker Panda Po, who dreams one day of being a kung fu master, works for his Dad, Mr. Ping (James Hong) in the family noodle shop. Note that Po's father is a duck, who dreams one day that Po will take over the family business. In a bizarre circumstance ancient tortoise Master Oogway (Randal Duk Kim) chooses Po as the Dragon Warrior. As Dragon Warrior, Po inherits the secrets of the sacred Dragon Scroll. The Dragon Warrior must protect the Valley from the powerful Tai Lung, who seeks the Dragon Scroll for himself. Oogway's student Master Shifu (Hoffman) had raised the young and gifted snow leopard Tai Lung (McShane) as his own to become the Dragon Warrior. However, Oogway sensed the darkness in Tai Lung, and dismissed him as Dragon Warrior. Oogway was forced to defeat the enraged Tai Lung, and banish him. Now Tai Lung returns.Shifu tells Oogway he is horribly mistaken in choosing Po. Oogway reminds his old friend, 'There are no accidents.' He also tells Shifu that the Dragon Warrior will bring peace to the Valley and 'bring peace to you'. Shifu's students The Furious FiveTigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane, and Viper, quickly dismiss Po. Admittedly, Po says 'I sucked more in the history of sucking' In particular Tigress (insightful and arrogant Angelina Jolie) tells Po, 'You don't belong here.' Here Directors Osbourne and Stevenson deliver their message home. The pitfall of the greatly skilled is arrogance, and this is embodied by the Tigress and the Furious Five, and in fact Shifu. Surprisingly Shifu does not get it, until the end. Shifu can't rely on what he knows to make Po this great Dragon Warrior. A master can only show The Path or The Way, and it is up to the student to reclaim the greatness within. It is all about discipline, courage, and humility. 'Kung Fu Panda' does all this in a very hilarious and visually spectacular package. I was laughing hysterically during the training session with Po and Shifu as they dueled with chopsticks over a delicious dumpling. The Furious Five trading blows with Tai Lung on the hanging mountain bridges was visually stunning.Jack Black really makes 'Kung Fu Panda' work. As voiced by Black, Po realizes the ridiculousness of his situation, but ultimately realizes this is his last chance to own up to his own greatness. Black is both hysterical and profoundly genuine. Dustin Hoffman is amazing as Shifu. Ironically and humorously he is a martial arts master, albeit a rodent of some sort, in love with his own accomplishments, clueless to The Way. Fortunately, Po comes into his life. Randal Duk Kim is great as the true Master Oogway. Angelina Jolie is brash and spirited as the skilled Tigress.'Kung Fu Panda' is one the best movies of the year. Besides being hysterical fun, it has great heart and a wonderful story. See 'Kung Fu Panda'.",10,4,7,15 June 2008
Rocketman," 'Rocketman' - I'm Not the Man You Think I Am
","In wistful eloquence, Director Dexter Fletcher captures Taron Egerton's Elton John composing his signature 'Your Song' donned in bathrobe, playing the piano in his Mother's living room. Elton's dear friend lyricist Bernie Taupin, played by Jamie Bell, listens in enchanted wonder. Glancing at Bernie, Elton sings: 'My gift is my song and this one's for you...' Elton is gay. Bernie is straight. 'Your Song' is my very favorite Elton John song, since I was a teen. It never occurred to me: Was that Elton's love song for Bernie?Throughout much of his life, Elton experienced the 'slings and arrows' of Rock Star fortune: illicit drugs, overdoses, and wanton gratuitous sex. In Director Dexter's musical bio fantasy 'Rocketman', music icon Elton's tragedy may have sourced from the frightened lonely boy, who just wanted to be loved.Dexter Fletcher took over as director for 'Bohemian Rhapsody', the rock group Queen bio pic about the late legendary Freddie Mercury, when Director Bryan Singer was fired by the studio. Both Freddie and Elton are gay men, who suffered in inauthentic self-expression. In familiar 'Rocketman' affinity, Dexter creates touching compassion amidst the absurdity of prejudice. Dexter wisely infuses the offbeat sense of humor.Taron is courageous vulnerability and resilience as tortured Elton, born Reginald Dwight. Taron awes in his vocal renditions of Elton John classics like 'Rocketman' and 'Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word'. As song lyricist partner Bernie, Jamie Bell embodies gentle wisdom and affection. He's Elton's only enduring friend. Bernie confesses to Elton, 'I love you man. I really do. Just not like that.'Paradoxically, that 'incomplete' love evolves as fate. At the narrative arc, Elton tells his emotionally bankrupt Mother Sheila, played by haunting Bryce Dallan Howard, that he's homosexual. She says, 'You will never be loved properly.' That too, becomes Elton's sentence.In the mural of fantastical sexual and musical narrative excess, Screenwriter Lee Hall poignantly constructs Elton's transformation as he begins to heal and love himself. Albeit clumsily, like the musical number emerging in Elton's dinner with his Mom and her boyfriend Fred, played by whimsical Tom Bennett. Yet, we still hold out hope that Elton discovers his measure of joy and peace.In flashbacks, Elton grew up in a dysfunctional English family. His Dad Stanley, dispassionate and disinterested Steven Mackintosh, is rarely home because of his work. When he is home, he listens to jazz, but not to his son. Elton's Mom tolerates her loveless marriage. In the aftermath stands young Reggie, played by bright innocent Matthew Illesley. Also Dad had never hugged his own son.Reggie is the gifted piano prodigy. He gets a musical scholarship to the Royal London Academy. His family spirals in demise. His parents divorce. Eventually, Reggie forms a band and tours with a Black Rhythm and Blues band, which reveals his soulful music roots. Furthering his music career, Reggie changes his name to Elton John. In apparent divine intervention Elton, the brilliant composer, who can't write a lyric, hooks up with lyricist Bernie Taupin. Elton and Bernie would emerge as one of the greatest songwriting duos of the 20th century.Alas, the downside of fame and fortune. Duplicitous John Reid, played with mercenary charm by Richard Madden, seduces innocent Elton. John insinuates his way into his life as Elton's business manager. Elton and Bernie continue to create prolific songs, as Elton succumbs into the abyss of addiction and depression with his eyes wide open.In an interview years ago, Elton said when he first started working with Bernie, he thought the words were superfluous. What mattered was the melody. That's what determined a great song. Years later, he got that words defined the song. Words resonated with the soul. Music and lyrics were like Yin and Yang for a song.Perhaps, the narrative failing of 'Rocketman' is its resolution. We know that Elton John in real life emerged from the darkness. He's in love, has a family. Recently, he announced his retirement from touring. Amen, good for Elton. The ending needed its own 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road'.That being said, I got 'Rocketman' in the bigger picture. Much like Elton may have written 'Your Song' for Bernie. Perhaps, Bernie wrote the song 'Rocketman' for Elton. He wrote: 'I'm not the man you think I am at home... Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone.' Elton was all alone. He just wanted to be gotten, to be loved. In that way, we can see a little of 'Rocketman' in all of us, too.",9,10,20,8 June 2019
A Star Is Born," Say Something So People Want to Hear It
","What do you have deep inside that you want to say? In Director Bradley Cooper's 'A Star Is Born' his fading rock star Jackson Maine holds in his arms Lady Gaga's rising star Ally as they gaze at the billboard of her record album cover. Gravelly voiced Jack says, 'Dig down into your soul... Say what you wanna say, because what you say is the stuff of angels.' Director Bradley Cooper's feature debut poignantly asks what do you have to say to the world, so people want to listen. 'A Star Is Born' is uncompromising in discovering one's voice in the world acknowledging the darker humanity of addiction and depression. Bradley and Lady Gaga, in her first starring movie role, are authentic and genuine: strength and frailty. Sam Elliot is eloquently powerful as Jack's older Manager brother Bobby, who loves his self-destructive baby brother. Not only did Bradley direct 'A Star Is Born', he wrote the screenplay with Eric Roth and Will Fetters. He learned to sing for a year and a half. He wrote songs for the movie with Lady Gaga. On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Lady Gaga said that she was blown away by Bradley: 'He sings from his gut.' As country rock star Jackson Maine, he is so convincing singing, 'Maybe it's time to let the old ways die.' He pops painkillers going on stage. He downs a bottle of Jack Daniels in the limo ride from his concert. Bradley embodies Jack's weary numbing suffering. Looking to get a drink, Jack drops in a dive drag bar in Los Angeles. His eyes widen listening to Lady Gaga's Ally singing a French song classic. Ally is special. Over drinks Jack discovers Ally, who works as a restaurant server, is a songwriter. He asks her why she doesn't sing her songs. Ally says that people like her songs, but not the way she looks. Lady Gaga is 'unplugged' in natural brown hair, sans glam makeup. Gaga inhabits Ally's insecurities like a glove. Yet like Jack, we see her greater within. Jack tells her, 'If there's one reason we're supposed to be here is to say something so people wanna hear it...' That's the beauty of 'A Star Is Born': It says something we want to hear. Predictably, yet naturally Jack and Ally fall in love in their star-crossed romance. Ally's star ascends when she sings her song 'Shallows' with Jack in concert. Sadly, Jack's star tragically descends in drug and alcohol addiction. Ally and Jack are truly in love: They see the greater within each other. However, love alone may not save Jack from his addictions. Bradley and Gaga are fearless compassion in the kind of poignant sadness that can heal. Director Cooper trusts his actor's humanity in stark authentic conversation. Ally cries to Jack, 'You hurt me!' Jack breaks down to Ally, 'I'm so sorry...' When Jack confesses to Bobby about 'stealing his voice' I cried. Lady Gaga is the star. She is so fierce in Ally's vulnerability. Her singing amazes. And you never catch her 'acting'; she is just being. She and Bradley don't romanticize the suffering of loving a drug addict; loving someone suffering from depression. You can only do your best. Responsibility is often a two-way street. That's the eloquent message of 'A Star Is Born'. Listening to Gaga's closing song moved me. Being in love is perhaps most important in life. Yet, we can't know what goes on inside another, even ones we love. 'A Star Is Born' reminds us that we must also have forgiveness in our hearts. I truly loved 'A Star Is Born'.",10,20,43,8 October 2018
Gravity," 'Gravity' Transforms
","'Gravity' pulls us in and transforms. Sandra Bullock is so powerful in Director Writer Alfonso Cuaron's 'Gravity', perhaps the year's best movie. Visually breathtaking to watch—I saw it in 3D. Cuaron and Cinematographer Emmauel Lubezki simply awe us with the stunning 15 minute continuous camera shot set 6000 miles above the earth. However, it is Sandra Bullock, who authentically pulls us in Cuaron's journey of loss and the rediscovery of our innate power. There is a stark moment as she gazes at us from the screen with her sad and haunting beauty, saying 'Who will pray for me?' 'Gravity' sources its sheer power from its humanity. Bullock's bold vulnerability touches and profoundly inspires. Bullock and George Clooney's captivating chemistry levitates this tale of the human spirit.At the movie's narrative arc, Clooney's Matthew Kowalski consoles Bullock's Ryan in the throes of despair. His words resonate in a strange twist. Clooney basically in a supporting role, is brilliant balancing Matt's brashness and deep seeded compassion. George is pure partnership in Sandra's tour de force.'Gravity' opens with the NASA Shuttle Explorer Mission to repair the Hubble Telescope orbiting above the earth. Bullock with close cropped haircut is bookish Medical Mission Specialist Ryan Stone, on her first space walk. Isolated Ryan, suffers with a family tragedy. Clooney is at his gruff and boastful best as Mission Commander Matthew Kowalski. Old hat and on his last mission, Matt is out to break the space walk record. Suddenly, the routine mission turns deadly as fiery debris from a Russian Spy Satellite collides with Explorer. The unthinkable happens, as Ryan becomes un-tethered and set adrift in deep space. Ryan and Matt now must do the impossible—find their way home. In space there is no sound, but we can hear our hearts pound.Director Cuaron captures the isolation and desolation of space. He leverages this into the haunting human desolation which lands with us. Sandra Bullock's Ryan suffers emotional wounds from the past, not to give away. In her performance she is also virtually alone. Bullock displays awesome physicality as she floats ballet-like on screen. She looks ageless and amazing as she reclaims her power. She lets go of all her defenses and touches our very souls. Bullock as Ryan pushes through amidst great fear and loss. She has the unique gravitas of moving our souls with a silent glance. In this amazing journey, she is not the same person at the beginning of the story. Neither are we. 'Gravity' will amaze and touch you.",10,2,11,6 October 2013
Wind River," What Makes Hero
","'Wind River' is absolutely powerful. So is Jeremy Renner. Elizabeth Olsen is sublime. Writer and Director Taylor Sheridan's 'Wind River' tells the tale of karma, of justice. Renner plays Fish and Game hunter Cory Lambert on the Indian Reservation in Wyoming â€“ Wind River. Cory is strong, sad, and lives by a code. Cory's marksman mastery hints of the military sniper past, although never disclosed. Olsen is the green, rather almost frozen FBI Agent Jane Banner, summoned from Las Vegas via her hometown in Florida, to investigate the heinous murder of a young woman in the sub-zero Wind River. Cinematographer Ben Richardson captures Nature's austere and unforgiving power. Conversely, Sheridan explores the power of forgiveness in people in 'Wind River'. Cory is estranged from his distant wife Wilma, played by strong Julia Jones, who is American Indian. They share custody of their 10 year- old son Casey, played by radiant Teo Briones. Both Cory and Wilma still grieve for their 16 year-old daughter Emily, who was tragically murdered 3 years ago. 'Wind River' opens on the frozen night as the beautiful young woman Natalie, played by bright Kelsey Asbille, runs bare foot and bloody across the snow pack. She would not survive. Cory discovers her body, doing his job as animal predator hunter. His painful visage is of recognition. Natalie's father Martin, played by compassionate Gil Birmingham, hugs and cries when Cory comes to the house. Cory weeps in silence as well. I cried. Later Cory tells Martin the amazing story. When Cory was healing over the death of Emily, he took a seminar. He said that what the seminar leader said always stayed with him. The seminar leader said, 'There is good news, and there is bad newsÂ…' The bad news: Cory's life will never be the same, his daughter was gone. Then he got this. He tells his friend Martin, 'Take the painÂ…' That is a way to keep the memory of his daughter in his heart, alive. Wow. 'Wind River' is about the lightness and darkness of humanity. Cory and Martin embody the best. However, life can be the paradox of great beauty and ugly. The ugly is the senseless and heartless murder of a 19 year-old woman. Along the darker path Olsen's fierce idealist FBI Agent Jane finds her partner in Cory to bring Natalie's murderers to justice. Although, Natalie was brutally beaten and raped, she died of the severe coldâ€” the frozen air in her lungs killed her. The local coroner tells Jane of this finding. This is an outrage to Jane, because this jeopardizes the murder investigation. The costs are too high. It's just not right. Renner and Olsen are amazing in their focused partnership. In the poignant scene Cory tells Jane about the murder of his daughter. Renner is fearlessly vulnerable and authentic courage. Olsen is naked in her humanity and compassion as she weeps staring into the bathroom mirror. There is the touching scene toward the end as Jane suffers envisioning what it was like for beaten Natalie to run 6 miles in the snow. Renner's Cory eloquently acknowledged Natalie, 'That's a warrior.' Cory and Jane are the true warriors as captured by Renner and Olsen. Cory and Jane seek justice in the darker side of humanity, the side that is cruel and dismisses human life. In the end is it about justice or karma? T.S. Eliot wrote in 'The Hollow Men': 'This is the way the world endsâ€”Not with a bang with whimper.' Even if it does it is all very sad. Renner's Cory knows this sadness, and is uncompromising in fighting for what is right, what is good. 'Wind River' is my favorite movie of the year, because it acknowledges both the beauty and ugliness of the world, and also believes in its heroes. Our heroes always inspire us to be greater than. Now that is a world worth living in.",10,1,6,20 August 2017
Star Trek," The Hero Emerges in 'Star Trek'
","On planet Vulcan while preparing for the defining moment in young Spock's life, his mother Lady Amanda (loving Winona Ryder) tells her son (Zachary Quinto), 'Oh Spock, you will always have a proud mother.' That was Director J.J. Abrams's defining moment for me. His 'Star Trek' is about the hero emerging from the love and legacy of family. Writers Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman create a classic story of the hero and destiny, with humor and great passion. They also have a reverence for what has come before, and the signature phrases of familiar iconic characters. Abrams, Orci, and Kurtzman may have altered the mythology for the better.Orci and Kurtzman reinvent 'Star Trek' as their own. The result is amazing storytelling. In the opening of 'Star Trek', they choose to illustrate the childhood and young adulthood of James T. Kirk and Spock before they entered Starfleet Academy. Child Spock (good Jacob Kogan) awaits the taunts of his fellow students regarding his half human, half Vulcan pedigree. However, when one Vulcan kid basically calls his mother a whore, Spock beats the crap out of that student. Note that in the Vulcan Way: emotion is acknowledged and controlled by choosing logic. Picking up Spock from the 'principal's office' his father Sarek (austere Ben Cross) implores his son, 'You will always be a child of two worlds, and fully capable of deciding your own destiny. The question you face is: Which path will you choose?' After holding his own against 4 Starfleet cadets, Captain Christopher Pike (strong and commanding Bruce Greenwood) tells Jim Kirk (Chris Pine), 'Your father was Captain of a starship for 12 minutes. He saved 800 lives, including your Mother's, and yours. I dare you to do better.' Pike is straight with rebel Kirk. He has all makings of greatness, so when is he going to knock it off, and step up? 'Star Trek' resonates in its story of the hero emerging.The last element comes later with appearance of 'old' Spock (great Leonard Nimoy), who plays an integral role in this narrative mythology. Here Nimoy provides gravitas as he advises Kirk (Pine) to reach out to his younger Spock (Quinto). Funny and ironically Pine points out to old Spock, 'We don't like each other. You hate me!' Spock reminds Kirk that they both need a 'defining friend'. The hero is defined by his friend or rival. In this case his rival is Romulan Nero (darkly powerful Eric Bana), who apparently is from a future time frame, here to exact his revenge for the loss of a loved one. Bana is brilliant in illuminating Nero's intentions, but never enrolling us in his cause.With the back drop filled, the relational dynamic is ready for warp drive as familiar characters enter the Academy and begin their careers. Karl Urban nails Dr. Leonard McCoy in persona and spirit. He even utters, 'I'm a doctor, not a physicist!' Zoe Saldana is stunningly beautiful and amazing as Nyota Uhura, future communications officer. She is strong, and provides a surprising pivotal love interest. John Cho and Anton Yelchin are good as Hikaru Sulu and Anton Chekov, each have done their homework. Simon Pegg fortunately appears nearly half way through the movie as engineer Scotty. Pegg is wonderful, and provides the movie's more whimsical moments. He even says, 'I can't give her anymore, Captain!' Predictably, Nero's reign of terror calls the cadets to emergency action. The suspended cadet Kirk and Commander Spock serve with Captain Pike on the Starship Enterprise. The Enterprise looks great and the CGI effects are slick. Fortunately, Abrams focuses on character and plot. The space battles are impressive, but are secondary to the battle of wills of Kirk and Spock. At a narrative arc Spock commands Kirk, 'I will not allow you to lecture me!' Kirk replies, 'Then why don't you stop me?' Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto give star defining performances and define 'Star Trek'. Pine emerges as the handsome and rugged leading man, who has a light touch and surprising power. He owns Jim Kirk's brashness and raw courage, and is never caricature. Quinto is simply amazing as Spock. Not only does he look like a younger Spock, he provides a restrained edge and compassion. Quinto boldly captures a character struggling to hide his innate humanity.Under J.J. Abrams's guidance and Orci and Kurtzman's amazing storytelling, 'Star Trek' is one of the best movies of the year. 'Star Trek' is the touching story of heroes, love, and family. 'Star Trek' gets it right.",10,2,10,10 May 2009
Memento," Inspired film making
","'Memento' is fabulous film-making. Writer-Director, Christopher Nolan, creates a world for the audience where we experience the life of his 'hero', Leonard (Guy Pearce), with more insight than the character himself. Nolan telling the story in a reverse time line (i.e. present to past), his attention to detail, and speculation of the nature of memory make the movie powerful. The movie is truly an amazing viewing experience. Guy Pearce gives a stunning performance as Leonard-- a man who has no short term memory since the murder of his wife, and is seeking vengeance on his wife's murderer. Pearce lends a sense of humanity and sadness to Leonard's quest that is touching. Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie is perfect as the mystery woman who is definitely not what she seems to be-- the classic femme fa tale. Carrie-Anne is a versatile and talented actress. Joe Pantoliano is so effective as 'Teddy', whom according to Leonard, can not be trusted. Nolan just gives us so much to look at in terms of our own lives... the memories we have and the stories we create for ourselves.",10,2,4,9 April 2001
Underworld," Romeo and Juliet done Goth
","'Underworld' under the direction of Len Wiseman is an action Gothic romance set in the world of the House of the Vampires versus the House of the Lycans. This is novel translation of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' in the realm of vampires and werewolves. Oddly enough, this is not much of a stretch of the mythic imagination-- which is a good thing. The strong and stunning Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a Vampire Death Dealer-- a vampire warrior who hunts down and kills Lycans (Werewolves). She is very good at what she does. Her cause is the genocide of the Lycan race. This war has gone on for almost the last 1000 years. In this mythology, the vampires are the aristocracy, and the Lycan are the indentured-- serfs for the vampire during the daylight. Over 500 years ago, the Vampire gained a decisive advantage with the murder of powerful Lycan leader, Lucian (a very good Michael Sheen), at the hands of the current Vampire Leader, Kraven (a somewhat effective Shane Brolly). In the slick opening action sequence where Selene and her group of warriors battle the Lycan in a public subway station, signatures of the Vampire and the Lycan race are distinguished. The Vampire are lean, strong, quick, smart, and skillful. The Lycan are loyal, cunning, savage, and possessing great brute strength. This is a cultural war. Through the narrative we learn that the Vampire and the Lycan originated from the the same bloodline which were the original immortals, the Corvina's. The Vampire and the Lycan were the result of 2 different viruses infecting the original bloodline. Selene discovers that the target for this Lycan attack is a human, Michael Corvin (a bewildered Scott Speedman). Corvin is of the Corvina bloodline. The legend is that he can merge both bloodlines and be stronger than either Vampire or Lycan. Selene also begins to suspect that Lucian (Sheen) still lives. So she brings back a trusted Vampire Elder, Viktor (Bill Nighy). But in doing so she uncovers her own past betrayal. Wiseman unveils the Vampire/Lycan mythology with style and expedience. Unlike 'The Matrix Reloaded', the mythology is not talked to death by it's characters, rather it is unraveled through the plot of finding Corvin, and the attraction between Corvin and Selene-- the star-crossed lovers. The genesis of this war (which does not really give away anything) was a tragic similar romance a 1000 years ago. Wiseman and screen writer Danny McBride, create a fascinating world and an almost timeless tale. Kate Beckinsale in a real departure from previous roles is an awesome action hero. She plays it smart, intense, and charismatic. She performs the action sequences with a sleek, compact, theatric style. And she is always wearing a body formed leather suit-- another good thing. Scott Speedman is solid in support as Michael. The other person who really shines is Michael Sheen as Lucian. There is a sheer kind of joy in Sheen's controlled evil, and dark presence. He is excellent. Credit Wiseman, Beckinsale, and cast in surprising us with some thoughtful entertainment all in an action movie that puts a new spin on the old Bard's classic star-crossed romance.",8,0,0,5 October 2003
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Felicity Jones is The Force
","'Rogue One' is exciting fun. Felicity Jones as hero Jyn Erso is a star. Director Gareth Edwards's movie is visually spectacular and action driven. Screenwriters Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroy tell the timeless story of courage and family. Edwards's 'Rogue One' is a standalone movie occurring in the timeline before 'Star Wars: Episode IV'. As engaging as the movie is, what is the purpose of 'Rogue One'? In the story Jyn along with renegade Rebellion members seek the plans of the Death Star weapon in 'Star Wars'. Jyn is drawn to the mission to rescue her beloved father Galen (Mads Mikkelsen). Galen was the scientist, who created the Death Star. Darth Vader voiced by James Earl Jones makes an ominous kick ass presence. Jones and Donnie Yen as blind warrior monk Chirrut Imwe are charismatic and bold. 'Rogue One' enlightens the coming events of 'Star Wars'. After watching the movie, I thought it missed the possible character evolution in terms of the Star Wars mythos. Jones, Yen, and Mikkelsen are captivating. I saw the movie in a Dolby Theater, and the battle with X-Wing and Tie-Wing fighters was amazing. In the end 'Rogue One' leaves us wanting more to the story. It does not seem as consequential in the bigger picture.'Rogue One' opens as Imperial Director Krennic (cold Ben Mendelson) apprehends Galen (Mikkelsen) to complete his work on the Death Star. Galen schemed for this inevitability. However, tragedy consumes. Krennic murders his wife. His daughter Jyn escapes and is raised by friend, Saw Gerrera (solid Forest Whitaker). Saw is an Imperial soldier turned Rebel. Jyn (Jones) grows into a powerful warrior.The Resistance Rebels and Cassian (Diego Luna) recruit Jyn as part of a larger conspiracy. Galen sent a message to Jyn about the designed flaw in the Death Star. Jyn heads to planet Jeda in hopes of discovering the whereabouts of her Father. There she meets Chirrut (Yen), and others. Is Jyn is a savior or pawn in the conspiracy? Felicity Jones is the force in 'Rogue One'. She is spunky and beautiful. She humanely embodies bravery and sadness as the hero in search of her father. Her relationship with Mikkelson's Galen is the touching core of the movie. World class martial artist Donnie Yen lends gravitas as Chirrut, who is a believer of The Force, but not a Jedi. Mendelson is good, but his Krennic is relatively evil light. That is punctuated with the appearance of Darth Vader himself. Director Edwards seamlessly ties his story forward to the Star Wars saga. He does so with perhaps a few too many characters. Jones makes this the great hero story. 'Rogue One' is amazing entertainment. Yet with the encompassing conclusion, you may be left wanting more.",8,2,9,28 December 2016
Captain Marvel," 'Captain Marvel': The Times You Get Back Up Define You
","In Disney and Marvel Studios' 'Captain Marvel', vulnerable Brie Larson as warrior Vers sheds tears speaking with someone from her human past, resilient Lashana Lynch as best friend Maria, 'I don't know who I am!' Maria acknowledges Vers, who was 'Aunt' to her daughter Monica, played by radiant Akira Akbar, 'You were the most powerful person I know.' Vers' humanity is the distinct power of 'Captain Marvel'.Brie evokes commanding presence as the emergent Hero. Curious note: No one really calls her Captain Marvel. She looks so cool in her sleek blue and red suit dispatching intergalactic villains with astounding martial arts skills.Yet, what resonates from Writer and Directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's narrative are 13 year-old Carol Danvers at bat after being struck down by an errant pitch. Or soiled Air Force cadet Carol rising from the ground after falling from the swinging obstacle course rope. Character defines destiny. Amen.Unlike by the numbers, loud big budget Superhero movies, independent filmmakers Anna and Ryan poignantly tell the human story of a woman's transformation. It's never about the number of times you fail or fall down. It's about the times you get back up.In 'Captain Marvel': the Hero arises. Having great strength, super speed or in Vers' case - photon blasts from her fists, can be significant. What makes her Hero, what makes her powerful is her belief in herself.'Captain Marvel' is Marvel's first standalone female Superhero movie. One might say, 'Well, it's about time.' Well, Anna, Ryan and Geneva Robertson-Dworet's screenplay is the timely tale of the woman revealing her untapped power within. Brie's Vers bravely distinguishes who she is. She also invents who she can be. 'Captain Marvel' is the surprising comic book narrative journey of self-discovery.Hero isn't about wearing the shiny suit or gaining tremendous physical prowess. Brie Larson is authentically bold as she discovers the Hero within herself, the Hero that has always been there. She exudes a refreshing sense of humor in the often dour Superhero construct. Brie brilliantly leverages endearing screen chemistry with aloof, charismatic Samuel L. Jackson as young Nick Fury, before the eye patch and SHIELD. Their whimsical banter is the welcome distraction from the galactic Kree - Skrull War. 'Captain Marvel' creators also generate relevancy in the refugee prejudice of the Alien Skrull.'Captain Marvel' opens on the Kree home planet - Hala. Apparent Kree Vers (Brie) is member of the elite Warrior group, Starforce. Her mentor is intrepid, war-weary Yon-Rogg, played by dashing strong Jude Law. Paradoxically, he tells Vers, 'I want you to be the best version of yourself.' Vers is constantly haunted by images of a 'previous life'.Starforce embarks on the mission to retrieve a spy from their dreaded enemy, the Skrulls. Vers is captured. Escaping further torture, she crash lands in a Blockbuster Video store on Earth, 1995. While awaiting for Yon-Rogg's rescue, Vers meets FBI Agent Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson - CGI enhanced to look 30 years younger. Fury's partner is Agent Coulson, played by equally CGI-ed, spirited Clarke Gregg. High-tech nostalgia at best.Vers and Fury reluctantly join forces to unconceal the Skull conspiracy and to locate the legendary Tesseract power source. Meanwhile, Vers resurfaces memories of the ubiquitous Supreme Intelligence, Leader of the Kree, played by beautiful sublime Annette Benning. Seems Vers knew her in her past human life as fighter pilot Captain Carol Danvers. Does Supreme Intelligence hold the secret of Vers' enigmatic past or her infinite future? Or both?At times, 'Captain Marvel' tries too hard to cover all its bases: as classic superhero movie, sci-fi mythology or stunning action adventure. Yet, its narrative resonance lives in its Hero - Vers and awesome Brie Larson. Brie is so strong, so compassionate in her character's reckoning. She soulfully defines: The Hero's power lies in her heart, in her humanity. 'Captain Marvel' is one of the best Marvel movies. It's just that great.",10,11,28,11 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Fun and Legacy, Too
","In the noisy gaudy opening of 'Iron Man 2' billionaire bad boy Tony Stark arrives at his Stark Expo in the Iron Man suit. Once removed from his body armor, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony admits, 'It's all about legacy.' Amidst the fun, high energy and stupid plot line, legacy does resonate as a poignant theme. I agree with A.O. Scott, that casting overcomes a lot in 'Iron Man 2'—I think I liked the movie more than he did. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. And Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko provides what every hero story requires: a formidable villain. Director Jon Favreau is smart in never taking the movie too seriously, letting his actors morph and evolve. Favreau provides some spectacular action and visuals. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark is stunning and heroic high drama.Downey is amazing in carrying off such a wide-band character in Tony. His Tony even cops to being a text book narcissist. Downey is one of the gifted actors, whom we can discern what is going on in his mind—through his eyes. He brings a crisp intelligence, brashness, and sobering humanity here. We learn that the palladium core that keeps Tony alive is rapidly poisoning his blood and killing him. At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (cool Samuel L. Jackson) wants Tony to uncover his father Howard's legacy, and solve the mysteries of his heart—on also a more profound level. Tony confesses his estranged relationship with his Father—'He never told me that he loved me.' But in his research Tony watches a message from his Dad. He says proudly, 'You are going to change the world what has always been and always will be my greatest creation is you, Tony' From then on I was into the movie.'Iron Man 2' may not be a good as the first, although it has a huge upside. Scarlett Johansson is hot as S.H.I.E.L.D. 'triple agent' Natasha Romanoff. She looks stunning in tight leather and performing Jeff Imada designed fight choreography. Beautiful and sprite Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Tony's worried assistant Pepper Potts—who Tony appoints as new CEO of Stark Industries. Tony and Pepper are so in love with each other. Will they ever figure this out by the end of the movie? You have powerful actors Downey and Rourke squaring off. Rourke is menacing and dangerous—he plays it dead on. In a subdued interrogation scene Vanko tells Tony, 'If you make God bleed, people will cease to believe in him.' Vanko is out to avenge his own father—defending his own legacy. Sam Rockwell nails the pompous and annoying Justin Hammer, Tony's industrial competitor. Gary Shandling is dead pan genius as the Senator, who demands Tony turnover Iron Man. To which Tony reminds, 'I have successfully privatized world peace.' 'Iron Man 2' is visually stunning with the spectacular battle with the Vanko built drones at the story arc. It is also a lot of fun as self destructive Tony in Iron Man suit dances to the late Adam Goldstein's mixes. 'Iron Man 2' is an action packed, fun, and funny mixed bag. It's not all that coherent. It's engrossing mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke, and its surprising story of legacy in spite of itself. And that works as well.",10,6,10,17 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Hysterical Sarah Marshall
","In a hysterical scene, Sarah Marshall (gorgeous Kristen Bell) complains that ex-boyfriend Peter (Jason Segal) can't 'rise' to the occasion in an intimate tryst. In reply Peter (Segal) screams, 'Could it be that you broke my heart into a million pieces?' I was laughing so hard at this, and at all of Director Nicholas Stoller's 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. Jason Segal also wrote the screenplay for 'Sarah Marshall' which is probably the year's funniest movie. Segal is funny as Peter, and his script is smart, hilariously on point, and really very sweet. Segal as Peter also sings in Count Dracula affect a song from his angst ridden rock opera about Dracula, which Peter always envisioned with hand puppets. There is a kabuki-like performance of his play that has got to be one the most inventively funny moments in years. The punch-line for Peter is that he admits someone pointed out that a Dracula rock opera was funny. 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is a wonderful surprise. Peter Segal is going to be a star. As Peter he plays a sweet vulnerable guy recovering from a break up. He is about as vulnerable as can be with his numerous full frontal scenes in hilarious effect.Peter's girl friend of 4 years is Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Sarah is a big time TV star on some 'CSI' clone crime show. Here Billy Baldwin makes a great cameo as her ridiculous detective co-star. Peter writes the musical score for the show. Peter and Sarah are Hollywood's next power couple. However, this is about to end. Sarah breaks up with a literally naked Peter. Sarah pleads with Peter to put some clothes on. Peter asks if he puts some clothes on, will she not break up with him. Sarah reluctantly cops to seeing someone else. Peter discovers from 'Entertainment Tonight' Sarah's new man is British rock star Aldous Snow (spaced-out cool Russell Brand). Peter's step brother Brian (charmingly geeky Bill Hader) urges Peter to move on. However, even meaningless sex reminds Peter of Sarah, and makes him weep. Dude has it bad. So Peter decides to take a vacation to Hawaii to get away from it all, only to find that he is at the same North Shore hotel as Sarah and Aldous. Rachel (stunning and spirited Mila Kunis) has compassion for Peter, recognizing him from the tabloids. She books him the $30,000 a night suite that Oprah usually gets for freethe only catch is that he has clean up the room. In hysterical scene, Rachel calls Peter in his suite and says that customers are complaining of a woman crying. Peter says he hears it too from the room above his. Rachel reminds him that he is in the penthouse. Predictably Peter falls for free-spirited Rachel, much to the ire of Sarah.Peter is befriended by an endearing and strange cast of characters at the resort, most of all Aldous (Brand). Brand is classic oblivious rock star, and its caricature of sexuality. Newlywed and very religious Darald (clueless funny Jack McBrayer) is in desperate search of his wife Wyoma's (Maria Thayer) cl------. Aldous instructs Darald in a ridiculous montage on the beach. The genuine Peter admits to Aldous while out surfing together, 'You really are cool' And Peter's surf instructor Kunu (whacked out Paul Rudd) says 'When life deals you lemons fk it!' Mila Kunis is totally charming as Rachel, and completely believable as the woman Peter falls in love with. Kunis and Segal have amazing chemistry. Kristen Bell really has the tougher role, and she is great. Sarah Marshall is beautiful, and a fathomless bitch. To her credit, Bell keeps Sarah light, avoiding the object of audience hatred. Russell Brand is over-the-top genius as Aldous. Ultimately, this is Jason Segal's movieliterally. He wrote the movie, and as Peter he nails a new age James Stewart charm. Segal as Peter is brilliant as the object of humor. Segal is smart and touchingly funny as a guy healing his broken heart.See 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. It is the funniest movie of the year with a surprisingly sweet romance. Jason Segal is going to be a big star.",10,3,11,20 April 2008
The Hunger Games," The Hero Emerges in The Hunger Games
","Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss in Zen-like focus draws her bow and aims her arrow to punctuate her point. Nothing personal. Making her point, she says. 'Thank you for your consideration.' Lawrence is amazing. Her Katniss is the brave and noble hero, who never forfeits being a woman, in fact it is the source of her courage and compassion in Suzanne Collins's 'The Hunger Games' envisioned on the movie screen. After selflessly volunteering as Tribute to replace her younger sister Prim (fearful Willow Shields) for The Hunger Games, she consoles friend Gale (charismatic Liam Hemsworth). Gale, her blossoming love interest and hunting mate, reassures, 'You're stronger than they are!' Katniss admits that she only hunts animals. Gale reminds that people are no different. At the dramatic arc in the woods, Katniss kills a boy out of rage and vengeance—still in icy repose. What good can come of kids killing each other, in a bloody contest of survival? That is the paradox of Director and Writer Gary Ross's 'The Hunger Games', based on the book by Suzanne Collins. Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray wrote the screenplay based on the first book of Collins's enormously popular bestselling trilogy. I have not read the books. One of my friends Carol, also a published author, had told me that the books were great. I took her word. 'The Hunger Games' is awesome: You have a young girl, who is the powerful hero of the tale. Jennifer Lawrence makes 'The Hunger Games' work. Katniss is not the physically strongest, fastest or most skilled warrior. However, she is the toughest and she's smart. In a great scene before the Games, she tells her costumer Cinna (fostering Lenny Kravitz), 'I'm not afraid.' And both Gale and Peeta, who fall in love with Katniss, are attracted to her courage and character. Collins gets her hero transformation right. 'The Hunger Games' depicts the post apocalyptic world, where the United States is now Panem which consists of 12 Districts. President Snow (calmly menacing Donald Sutherland) seemingly uses starvation and shiny objects to oppress the population. These are the 74th Hunger Games. Every year each District sends a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to the Capital to compete in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are like the reality TV 'Survivor' on steroids combined with cage fighting, where children compete to the death—only one winner. Though set in the distant future the story opens in Katniss Everdeen's home District 12 which looks like a 1930's coal mining town. The dichotomy is that each cabin has a flat screen to watch The Hunger Games. Ross and cinematographer Tom Stern ('Million Dollar Baby') have a serene affinity for the land—filmed mostly in North Carolina. The music by T-Bone Burnett and James Newton Howard provides a haunting down home atmosphere. Katniss lives with her Mom and sister Primrose (innocent and fragile Shields). Her Dad died in mining accident. Katniss helps feed her family as an expert archer and hunter.When Tribute Escort Effie Trinket (seemingly vapid and unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) selects Primrose in The Hunger Games lottery, Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers to take her place, and save her life. The other participant selected is Peeta (subdued and strong Josh Hutcherson). They travel to the Capitol to train and compete in The Hunger Games. They meet their mentor and former winner Haymitch Abernathy (deceptively powerful Woody Harrelson), who occurs as a drunk washout. Harrelson is one of the wonderful touches: As Haymitch he distinguishes the greatness in both Katniss and Peeta. He schools them in playing the Game. Peeta reveals that he has always been in love with Katniss. And she practically strangles him after his disclosure. 'The Hunger Games' has a broader metaphor. When President Snow talks with Host Seneca Crane (meticulously charming Wes Bentley), he says that the only thing more dangerous than fear is hope. The Hunger Games exist to kill all hope. Amidst the atrocity of children killing each other for celebrity and food, the hero emerges in Katniss, who inspires others. Lawrence never sacrifices Katniss's humanity and boldly acts in the presence of fear. She gets amazing support from a talented cast. Stanley Tucci balances flamboyance and awareness as talk show host Caesar Flickerman. Amandla Stenberg is touching and powerful as young Rue, who befriends Katniss. Hutcherson is vulnerable and brave as Peeta. In the story Peeta can throw a 100 lb. weight 50 feet, but this is never used as a logical threat. Granted the twist is that Katniss is the savior. The fighting scenes, including the climatic fight, are difficult to discern in the quick cut edits—maybe not Ross's strength. 'The Hunger Games' is not an action movie, but action threaded. This is a minor point in the big picture. 'The Hunger Games' is the great classic hero story that inspires others to dare to be great. Jennifer Lawrence is the awesome hero Katniss. Bring on the revolution and the sequel.",10,5,18,26 March 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Greatness Emerges from Into Darkness
","On the shuttle-craft journey to stop the powerful enigmatic John Harrison (menacing charismatic Benedict Cumberbatch), Zachary Quinto's Spock tells his love Uhura (Zoe Saldana) that he chooses not to feel, paradoxically the humane choice. Later in the heart wrenching story arc Chris Pine's Captain Kirk asks Spock, ' How do you choose not to feel?' Director J.J. Abrams's reinvention of the Star Trek mythology in 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is awesome. 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is not just a great Star Trek movie. It is a great movie. Action packed, thought provoking, funny, and unexpectedly touching. Writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof are beholding to the saga, twisting the narrative, and boldly going where no one has gone before. Theirs is a Star Trek that is familiar and genesis of a new generation of fans. Michael Giacchino's score is heroic and stellar.Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are amazing as Kirk and Spock, becoming their own. Pine and Quinto are never caricature, generate from, and are reverent homage. Distinct under Abrams's direction their partnership is punctuated by respect and love-- the leverage point of this provocative context of terrorism and the cost of 'the no win scenario'. This story of terrorism is more poignant than 'Iron Man 3', and set in the 23rd Century. Qunito is awesome as Spock. He captures Spock defining himself: ironically funny, heroic, torn between his Human emotions and Vulcan logic. And we get to see Spock kick some ass! Pine is amazing. He balances the bravado and self doubt as Kirk, and not nearly so cock sure. In a great scene Kirk says to his crew, 'I'm sorry.' Karl Urban is rock solid and amazing as Bones, Dr. McCoy—the emotional conscience. Kirk asks Bones: What would Spock do? He says, 'He'd let you die.' As my friend Ron reminds: the best Star Trek stories were morality plays. Morality plays have great villains. The powerful villain is rogue Star Fleet Officer, John Harrison played by Cumberbatch. The enigmatic Harrison is ruthless, brilliant, and possessing inhuman strength. In spectacular scene on the Klingon home world Harrison effortlessly dispatches Klingon warriors with martial arts and weapon skills. Cumberbatch is a mesmerizing threat; his Harrison is driven by vengeance, and hides a secret. He asks Kirk 'Is there anything you would not do to save your family?' Grounded after violating Star Fleet Prime Directive on the primitive planet Nibiru to save his friend Spock, in the stunning visual opening, Kirk (Pine) is discharged from his command of the Enterprise and charged under his mentor Admiral Christopher Pike (courageous and wise Bruce Greenwood). Star Fleet Headquarters was a target of a terrorist bombing. Kirk uncovers Harrison's involvement, and discerns that his motives are not what they seem. After a bloody courageous fire fight Kirk suffers personal tragedy. Now he too, is driven by revenge. Enter maverick Admiral Marcus (hard-nosed Peter Weller), who reinstates Kirk on a mission to kill Harrison. Marcus's daughter Carol Marcus (spirited and beautiful Alice Eve) covertly enrolls in the mission. That name is pivotal for fans.Let the wild ride commence. Visceral physical conflict and dramatic images of the Enterprise in battle thrill. However, it is the war of wills of Kirk, Spock, and Harrison that awe. The rest of the crew has their shining moments, particularly Saldana and John Cho as Sulu. Spock questions the ends justify the means paradigm adopted by benevolent Star Fleet. Later Kirk tells Spock, 'I have no idea what I'm supposed to do! I only know what I can do!' In Abrams's morality play all is not what it seems. Villains can be heroic. Vengeance consumes. True heroes inspire. I can't wait for the continuing voyages of the Enterprise. May they continue to boldly go where no one has gone before.",10,4,12,8 June 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Judas Redemption
","'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' based on the C.S. Lewis novel has a long title, and is a great movie. It is one of the year's best. Director Andrew Adamson and screenwriters Ann Peacock, Adamson, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely bring to life Lewis's story of four children's journey to the fantastical kingdom of Narnia. This maybe Disney's 'Lord of the Ring'-- a wise selection. Director Adamson creates a visually stunning live action tale seamlessly incorporating state-of-the art CGI, and classic compelling storytelling. Adamson also keeps our focus on this story thread despite such distractions as talking animals and mythical creatures which are an integral part of the context.During the beginning of World War II, Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy (Georgia Henley), are sent to live with an eccentric relative Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent) somewhere in the English countryside. Away from their mother, the children make the best of their situation. While playing their favorite game of hide-and-seek, the youngest Lucy enters the upstairs wardrobe, and finds herself in another world, Narnia. Lucy befriends Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), a faun or half-man creature. From Mr. Tumnus, Lucy discovers that Narnia is ruled by the evil White Witch (the amazing Tilda Swinton) where it has been winter for 100 years without Christmas. Upon returning through the wardrobe, Lucy tells Peter, Susan, and Edmund. They do not believe her story. However, Edmund happens upon Narnia through the wardrobe, and aligns with the White Witch. The White Witch is aware of the prophesy involving the sons and daughters of Adam. Eventually Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy all enter Narnia. They learn from Mr. and Mrs. Beaver that the White Witch's reign will soon end with the return of the legendary lion leader Asland (perfectly voiced by Liam Neeson).Alsand is literally and metaphorically the messiah in C.S. Lewis's story. Edmund (Keynes), forced into loyalty to the White Witch, is the story's Judas. He betrays Peter, Susan, Lucy and ultimately Asland, unknowingly becoming the White Witch's pawn. The courageous and noble Asland gives his word to the malevolent White Witch in this epic battle of good and evil. Perhaps the difference in this parable, Adamson and Lewis offer the possibility of redemption for this story's Judas-- Edmund.Andrew Adamson is the great storyteller in 'The Chronicles of Narnia.' 'Narnia' is an epic tale of sacrifice and redemption that beautifully captures the wonder and awe of children embodied in Lucy. Georgia Henley gives Lucy a great soul, innocence and courage. Her touching bond to the charismatic Asland (Neeson) is the heart of 'Narnia'. Tilda Swinton is a powerful dark presence as the White Witch. Swinton as the Witch is such a threatening force. Liam Neeson perfectly voices Asland. Neeson too is an amazing presence. His Asland is wise and noble, also hinting at great anger and great power. The clash of wills between Asland and the White Witch is compelling. Adamson's 'The Chronicles of Narnia' is classic storytelling of a timeless story, well worth watching.",10,0,1,18 December 2005
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," For Your Soul Mate
","Estranged Carl (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) sit in uncomfortable school chairs in the silent hallway waiting for their parent teacher conference for their eccentric son Robbie (Jonah Bobo). Carl says, 'I miss you Em.' He confesses his anger for not having the courage to fight for her, ' because you fight for your soul mates.' You fight for your soul mate. That is what distinguishes and touches your heart about 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa in tandem narrate this hysterical and poignant portrait of life. I did not notice that Ficarra and Requa co-helmed this voyage until the end credits. In retrospect, this makes sense given the distinct narrative threads that poetically intertwine. 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is one the best movies of year. Julianne Moore is amazing, deserving of an Oscar Nomination. Ryan Gosling as master player and Carl's mentor, Jacob, is awesome in his bravado and reluctant compassion. Gosling too deserves a Supporting Nomination nod. Steve Carell is invisible in his understatement; though his performance as Carl is all authenticity, vulnerability, and courage. His speech at the story arc is in character, and powerfully touches your soul. He is brilliant.The transparency and fluidity of 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is the genius of Ficarra and Requa. They seamlessly envision the screenplay by Dan Fogelman. The innate brilliance of Fogelman is that in this world, people are smart; it's just sometimes we all do stupid things. The most courageous of us forgive. Carell and Moore have astounding chemistry. I was in awe of the scene at night where Carl sneaks into his home to garden the lawn. While their kids have ice cream in the kitchen, Emily calls Carl's cell in another room. She invents a washing machine problem to ask Carl's advice. He plays along, all the while watching Em from the lawn. What resonates is their unspoken love. As 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' opens we witness all too familiar Carl and Emily having their scheduled dinner date, while the kids are left with the babysitter Jessica (sharp and beguiling Analeigh Tipton). Out of nowhere Em announces that she wants a divorce after 27 years. On the drive home Em also confesses an affair with co-worker David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon). Bacon is awesome in his charming smugness. When Em refuses to shut up, Carl ejects himself from the moving car. Back home Jessica finds herself in the midst of Carl and Emily's implosion. Jessica secretly is in love with the solid Carl—why she takes the gig. Previously, to the deathly embarrassment of their son Robbie, Jessica unexpectedly witnesses 13 year-old Robbie's crush on her. For Jessica, Carl is the fantasy opportunity. For Robbie, he is perhaps alone on an island. Carl moves out of their home into an apartment. Clumsily and desperately he begins frequenting a local bar. Slick handsome master player Jacob dressed in his Dolce' suit has compassion for wallowing Carl, whose wife slept with David Linhagen. Carl begrudgingly agrees to a makeover and Jacob schools him in the art of getting with women. One tip for Carl: Never talk about yourself. Amazingly sound. In the meantime, smart and beautiful Hannah (Emma Stone) is a law student studying for the bar exam, with expectations of joining the firm where she interns. More specifically, she is holding out for marriage proposal from the firm's deadly bland attorney Richard (scarily boring Josh Groban). Hannah's friend Liz advises that she can do way better. She also warns Hannah that she has a 'PG-13 love life'. While the two are having a drink at the bar, Jacob makes a play for Hannah. Jacob is bewitched by Hannah, partial, because she seems immune to his charms. Later when Hannah's world collapses, she tracks down Jacob to 'bang' the hot guy who hit on her. He queries, 'They still say banging?' Emma Stone is wonderful. She is naturally self-deprecating with a big heart. When shredded Jacob takes off his shirt, Stone says, 'Come on! It's like you're photo-shopped!' Ryan Gosling is ripped, but that is eclipsed by his amazing performance. He humanizes the transforming cad, who finds his soul mate and is completely defenseless. Gosling evokes a quiet power. When Carl tells Jacob that Hannah is too good for him, he gazes into his drink and admits, 'I know' The cast all have their moments. Tipton is a surprise as Jessica. She captures the angst of the teen growing into a woman. Marisa Tomei is restrained comedic brilliance as Kate. Bobo as Robbie is harder to peg. At times he seems relegated to appointed jester; however, he poignantly reminds his Dad that you fight for your soul mate. Writer Fogelman culturally whips everything at us, from hysterical sexting, 'Twilight' jokes, to even 'Dirty Dancing'. At the end one concluding narrative thread on the surface is humorous, and perhaps unintentionally creepy. Probably chalk it up to the eye of the beholder. Acknowledge and applaud Ficarra and Requa for the poignant and humorous catharsis. 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is all about the possibility of finding and fighting for your soul mate. Sure love can make you crazy or sometimes do stupid things. And love is the only thing that matters.",10,2,4,9 August 2011
Us," 'Us' - The Metaphorical Puzzle in a Good Way?
","In Writer and Director Jordan Peele's 'Us', it's 1986: Little African American girl Adelaide, played by Madison Curry, encounters her doppelganger in the carnival tent on the Santa Cruz beach. Little Adelaide's eyes widen in terror.Now 2019, on the family vacation car ride, Mom Adelaide Wilson, played by loving and beautiful Lupita Nyong'o, jokes with her children, daughter Zora, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Halloween mask wearing son Jason, played by Evan Alex. Adelaide and her husband Gabe, played by solid Winston Duke, drive to meet up with friends Kitty, played by Elizabeth Moss, and Josh, played by Tim Heidecker, and their twin daughters for their Santa Cruz summer holiday. Yeah, that's Jordan's discreetly frightful foreshadowing.Funny. Santa Cruz might be an homage to Joel Schumacher's 1987 'The Lost Boys'. Although, 'Us' is not about the indigenous vampire in Santa Cruz. Jordan's narrative is somewhat more sinister: Our 'tethered' doppelgangers (personal doubles) possibly live in the millions of subterranean tunnels in the US. Or so we are made to believe according to Jordan's movie prefaced research.Scary movies are really not my deal. Yet, my movie critic buddy Michael told me that 'Us' is worth seeing. That was good enough for me.The first 2 Acts of 'Us' are amazing narrative and visually foreboding atmosphere from master storyteller Jordan Peele. Lupita brilliantly disguises Adelaide's unresolved childhood fear, safeguarding her children with all her being. Winston Gabe is comically at a loss in discerning his wife's seeming turmoil. Also Adelaide and Gabe's dynamic with Kitty and Josh occurs as the social status comparison game. Oh, well.Then one night, the Wilson's receive uninvited guests at their rented beach home. They're also the family of four. Jason says, 'It's us.' They're the evil versions of Adelaide, Gabe, Zora and Jason. Or are they really 'the evil ones'? Terror and havoc ensue on screen.Act 3 of 'Us' is totally WTF? No worries. No spoilers here. At a certain point I didn't know what was going on. Jordan seduces with the bloody mayhem. Yet, there is something more subversive in his narrative, perhaps about our own human nature?I didn't find 'Us' as so much scary, rather it's entirely disturbing - in a good sort of way. Later, I confirmed with Michael about a storyline that might have been obvious, to others. For sure, other theories surrounding 'Us' will emerge. Wait for it.Amazingly, Jordan circles back his story to the movie's seemingly innocuous premise, and he fosters further discussion in his shocking conclusion. Lupita's compassionately humane performance as Adelaide anchors 'Us'; keeping us watching; keeping us in Jordan's master guessing game.I'd love to see 'Us 2'. I'm also guessing that's part of Jordan's master narrative. Just saying.",8,2,5,2 April 2019
Balls of Fury," Hysterical 'Balls'
","Academy Award Winner Christopher Walken stars as the evil Feng in 'Balls of Fury'. That's about the closest in context to an Academy Award that 'Balls of Fury' will ever get. This is an absurd role choice for Walken, who is painfully funny. Director and Writer Robert Ben Garant's 'Balls of Fury' is low budget, cheesy, and just stupid funny. 'Balls of Fury' is hysterical and laugh out loud funny. Garant along with co-writer and star Thomas Lennon demonstrate their own pairs when it comes to take no prisoners comedy. Granted a lot of their rapid fire jokes veer off target, but quite often they land without mercy. There is a classic line as ping pong Master Wong (James Hong) advises his charge Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler), 'It is better to die like a tiger, than to live like a pussy' 'Balls of Fury' has its moments of clever genius. Keep in mind, Garant and Lennon's art is shameless camp.'Balls of Fury' is a blatant parody of Bruce Lee's 'Enter the Dragon'. Instead of the villainous Han holding an exclusive martial arts tournament on his island off the coast of China inviting the world's best martial artists, we have the evil Feng (Walken) holding a ping pong tournament at his compound somewhere in Central America inviting the world's best ping pong players. This is a ping pong tournament to the death. We are vividly reminded of this from the 'Balls' trailer. The ping pong tournament is apparently a cover for Feng's nefarious business activity. FBI Agent Ernie Rodriquez (comedian George Lopez) believes that if he can get a man to infiltrate Feng's Tournament, he could expose the operation. That man would be Randy Dayton (Dan Fogler).Randy Daytona was America's darling kid hopeful for Olympic ping pong Gold at the Seoul Games of 1988. During his semifinal match with whacked out German Champion Karl Wolfschtagg (over the top funny Thomas Lennon), Randy experiences a catastrophic collapse. He never recovers. Now 19 years later, Randy is performing ping pong dinner theatre in Reno. Randy reluctantly enrolls in Ernie's covert mission. Feng may have been the man responsible for Randy's father's death, so for Randy this is also a mission of vengeance. However, it is unclear for Randy himself or the audience. Randy clearly is no longer the Olympic competitor he once was; thus, he must train with revered ping pong master and Chinese restaurant owner Master Wong (hysterical Hong). Master Wong is blindpart of his enlightened charm. Wong also risks his livelihood and reputation by taking on 'round eye' as his student. Wong's hot niece Maggie (beautiful Maggie Q) helps instruct Randy in the Way of Ping Pong. Maggie is also a deadly martial artist as demonstrated in a hilarious beat down of wannabe gropers. Feng too, may have been responsible for Maggie's father's death.Feng was Master Wong's best student. Now this is Randy Daytona's time. Will Randy dig deep down, and discover that 'it is not the paddle, but the man'? Will he fall in love with Maggie? Will he reclaim his inherent greatness at Feng's Tournament? Well, part of the inexplicable charm of 'Ball of Fury' is its predictability, and its off the wall gags. There is a side splitting joke about Feng's sex slaves that features the great Diedrich Bader. And Randy's match with the notorious Dragon is hilarious.The bizarre casting completes 'Balls of Fury''s glorious camp. As mentioned before, Christopher Walken is hysterical. He carries off the Elton John Captain Fantastic couture like a champ. Walken plays the role totally straight. His aloof cool is deadly. This is the first time I have ever seen Dan Fogler. Fogler is short, fat, goofy, and not at all athleticthe perfect antithesis of a Bruce Lee hero. This makes perfect sense. Fogler is naturally funny and self absorbed. He has impeccable timing and delivery. Maggie Q is deadly sexy as Maggie. She displays an effortless touch for broad comedy, and has star presence. She is great. James Hong is completely hilarious as blind Master Wong. He is so over the top funny with some of the movie's best lines. Terry Crews makes a masterful ridiculous turn as defending U.S. ping pong champion. Even Jason Scott Lee ('Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story') turns up in 'Balls'.'Balls of Fury' is not a cinematic tour de force by any means. But for what it is, a stupid funny movie, 'Balls' delivers. 'Balls of Fury' is laugh out loud funny, and fun to say.",8,5,9,5 September 2007
Spider-Man 2," The Hero in Us All...
","At one point in Director Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2', Peter Parker's Aunt May (wonderfully played by Rosemary Harris) says of heroes: '...I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.'This nature or distinction of hero is what really resonates and distinguishes 'Spider-Man 2'. A hero resonates across cultures. He or she is distinguished by courage, selflessness, nobility, honor, and most of all-- heart. Whether or not the hero in this case wears a red and blue spider suit to save others, what matters is the inherent greatness of the individual in action. Hero is to the soul. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man embodies the possibility of the hero in all of us. Maguire has such a humanity about him, and is so commanding in his stillness and calm. His understated performance choices punctuates Peter Parker's courage and compassion. Along with Sam Raimi's masterful direction, and Alvin Sargent's character and plot driven screenplay, 'Spider-Man 2' is compelling work. I think that it is better than 'Spider-Man', and one of the best movies of the year. 'Spider-Man 2' also has a more evolved love story between Peter (Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) which really works. And of course the CGI effects are phenomenal. This time around the storytelling is not so linear. Peter (Maguire) is burning out as Spider-Man. He has forsaken his love for MJ (Dunst), aware that if he revealed his love for her, her life would be endangered by his enemies. Consequently, Peter is suffering. The new enemy is Doc Ock (a compelling Alfred Molina), who because of a tragic fusion experiment becomes fused to deadly mechanical tentacles. Though the villain, Doc Ock is not entirely evil. Originally Dr. Otto Octavius is a good man who falls victim in the pursuit of his dreams to transform the world. This is a wonderful touch. Molina is effective in retaining his character's vestige of idealism throughout. Also returning in 2, is a charismatic James Franco as Harry Osborn, who has sworn vengeance on his father's 'murderer', Spider-Man. Along the way, Harry and Dr. Ock form an unholy alliance against... Spider-Man. Sam Raimi is a master storyteller. His narrative style is powerful, compelling, and has a sense of humor. The action sequences and CGI effects are visually stunning. The scene in which Spider-Man attempts to save passengers on a runaway train is simply awesome. The romance between Peter and MJ is very touching. Raimi also provides some dramatic surprises. Toby Maguire's performance as Peter gives Spider-Man 2 its soul. As Peter, he is doing this best 'to be steady', sacrificing what he wants most, and being true to the part of himself that is hero. A hero is one that inspires those around him or her to greatness. So a hero reminds us of the very best in ourselves-- the part that is compassionate, courageous, and noble. 'Spider-Man 2', though just a movie reminds us all, of our own greatness.",10,0,0,3 August 2004
"I Love You, Man"," Loved 'I Love You, Man'
","In 'I Love You, Man' Sydney (Jason Segal) gives an engagement dinner toast for aghast Peter (Paul Rudd). Sydney says to Peter's fiancé Zooey (pretty Rashida Jones), 'Give it back. Return the favor.' Later Peter asks bud Sydney to a golfing double date with Zooey's best friend Hailey (hilariously uptight Sarah Burns). Peter tells Sydney that he owes him for asking Zooey to give Peter oral sex in his dinner toast. Sydney confesses, 'You have a valid point.' The story by Director John Hamburg and Writer Larry Levin is brilliantly hysterical. The narrative threads whether it is man dates or air guitar at a Rush concert, are inventive and drop dead funny. Where else would you hear Zooey say to Peter, 'Who picks a f****ing fight with Lou Ferrigno?' Paul Rudd has become the genius comic straight man in romantic comedies. Rudd and Jason Segal are a classic comedic team. Director Hamburg keeps it loose in this modern day 'bromance'. He gets hysterical performances from his entire cast including Jamie Pressly, J.K. Simmons, Tevin Downey, Andy Simmons, and Jane Curtin. As big as its laughs, Hamburg and Levin give 'I Love You, Man' a bigger heart.Peter is a realtor in Los Angeles. When Peter introduces Zooey as his fiancé to his family, his gay brother Robbie (comfortable and cool Andy Samberg) tells Zooey, 'Peter's always been a girlfriend guy.' His Dad (brilliantly goofy J.K. Simmons) says, 'Peter never really had a best friend.' It soon becomes obvious that there may be something glaringly off with perfect Peter. Peter over hears Zooey and her friends at a girls' night at their place. Denise (funny sexy Jamie Pressly) points out that Peter not having any buddies is kind of creepy, and that he may become 'clingy'.Peter realizes that he must make friends with guys. Besides he has to find a Best Man for his wedding. Zooey is supportive in Peter's man dates. To that end Peter enrolls fitness trainer Robbie as his man date mentor. His first man date is a near disaster. Guys poker night with Denise's husband Barry (funny Jon Favreau) is nightmarishly funny.At an open house for his client Lou Ferrigno, Peter meets Sydney. Buddy inept Peter seems to connect with Sydney, who admits to coming to the open house for the free food. Apparent carefree slacker Sydney is an investor. They exchange business cards. Now it's up to Peter to man up and ask Sydney to go out and hang. Rudd is genius in his awkwardness in trying way too hard to be one of the guys. Peter and Sydney finally meet up for beer and tacos—they bond. Soon Peter and Sydney are playing bass and guitar to their favorite Rush songs. Concerned Zooey soon wonders if she is losing Peter. Happy-go-lucky bachelor Sydney is not all that he seems. His friends are gradually growing away with family and other responsibilities. As much as Peter needs bro Sydney, Sydney is also wanting.Predictably the Third Act becomes the resolution of Peter's relationship with Zooey and Sydney. Here 'I Love You, Man' is surprisingly compassionate. It still maintains hysterical crassness throughout. However, there is something very heartwarming when Peter admits, 'I love you, man.' Paul Rudd is amazing as Peter, who is doing his best to fit in and make things right. 'I Love You, Man' works, because Rudd can be with funny. Jason Segal is natural whacked out, but never over done as Sydney. Rashida Jones is vulnerable charm as Zooey. 'I Love You, Man' is one of the funniest and smartest movies of the year.",10,2,6,1 April 2009
Superbad," Super Good 'Superbad'
","In the opening rift between our heroes Evan (Michael Cera) and Seth (Jonah Hil) on their drive to school, it is transparent from their explicit, crude, hysterical exchange that these graduating seniors want desperately to get laid before heading off to college. Theirs is a noble pursuit. Well, at least the honest pursuit for our geeky duo. Like the characters of 'Superbad', the writers share their names, Seth Rogan (of 'Knocked Up') and Evan Goldberg. Seems that 'Superbad' is somewhat biographical, which lends insight. Amidst all the movie's outsider teen angst and exaggerated sexual bravado, Director Grag Mottola's 'Superbad' is ultimately about growing up and lasting friendship. Mottola strikes a unique balance and tone. 'Superbad' is definitely not for kids with its graphic language, sans any explicit sex; however, it is amazingly bitter sweet. For the creators of 'Superbad', they ignored any conventions of taste and their story is boldly sentimental and personal. 'Superbad' has an authentic ear for male teen speak. Smart and shy Evan expresses, 'Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out by our boners and stuff That's the world I one day want to live in.' Yes, that would be a perfect world. There is a lot of funny stuff in 'Superbad'.Evan (Cera) and Seth (Hill) are childhood friends, who are about to graduate from High School. Evan and Seth also face separate futures. Evan is going to Dartmouth in the fall. Seth, unable to get in, will attend State college. These final weeks of High School for them represent their last chance to 'score' before heading to college and their new lives. Evan and Seth are uncool geeks, though in a charming way. Evan is the tall smart silent dork, who is sweet on Becca (bubbly and cute Martha Maclsaac). Seth is the smart ass overweight kid, who has a non-zero chance of getting laid on his own, and is such a drama queen about not getting any. Seth hooks up with pretty Jules (spirited Emma Stone) in home economics class. Her parents are out of town, and she is throwing a party. Jules would be indebted if Seth can obtain alcohol from her party, 'You scratch our back and we'll scratch yours.' Classy Seth replies, 'Funny thing about my back it's located on my' Suddenly, all relies upon Evan and Seth's buddy Fogell (very funny Christopher Mintz-Plasse), who has a fake Hawaii driver's license as organ donor McLovin. For those who have seen the trailer, the classic line is: 'Yes, I am McLovin.' However, something ridiculously goes wrong at the liquor store, and officers Slater (Bill Hader) and Michaels (Seth Rogen) are called to the scene. From this point high jinx and debauchery abound.Rogen and Goldberg's storytelling takes apparent tangential and hysterically tasteless turns, but there seems to be a point to the chaos. The telling betrayal is not about girls and sex, rather it is about friendship. To that end 'Superbad' works, because of its strong performances and Mottola's natural direction. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill are amazing comedic partners. Although, they have their bitchy moments, their underlying love for each other in spite of themselves makes 'Superbad' strangely poignant. Cera has a comfortable charm and innocence even in Evan's most uncool moments. He has a great line while pulling himself together,' Calm down She wants to suck on your' We have a genuine affinity and familiarity for Cera as Evan. Hill as Seth has the funnier lines. Hill is an amazing dorky smart ass. He also wisely tempers Seth's vulnerable side, and shows Seth's human side when he lets his guard down. Christopher Mintz-Plasse practically steals the movie as 'McLovin'. Mintz-Plasse has a nerdy ease and brilliance. What he does is play Fogell as a good kid, who just wants to be cool. As Fogell, he finds that he is cool, when he isn't trying so hard. He has a hysterical scene where he dances with hot Nicola (Aviva).The ending of 'Superbad' got me. No worriesthis does not give anything away. With all the hilarious raunch, the message is that things happen when they happen, and given a choice good people will do the right things. I did not expect that from 'Superbad'. It is a laugh out loud expertly written movie, well worth seeing. 'Superbad' is the smart, funny movie of the year.",10,1,6,3 September 2007
Creed," Creed in Great Legacy
","Director and writer Ryan Coogler's 'Creed' is awesome. More than a 'sequel' of the 'Rocky' movies, Coogler brilliantly reinvents the 'Rocky' saga for the hip-hop and cyber versed generation. Coogler with his 'Creed' is beholding to heart, love, and the journey of rediscovering our innate greatness—what made the original 'Rocky' so special. Michael B. Jordan is powerful and gives a nova-like performance as Adonis ('Donnie), son of the late world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. Coogler and Aaron Covington's screenplay wisely brings back Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa, ironically serving as his mentor Mickey (Burgess Meredith) to young upstart Adonis. Stallone embraces the evolution of Rocky—he is amazing. The paradox does not escape us that Rocky's words come from Coogler and Covington, and Stallone generates touching gravitas and vulnerability — which may earn him a nomination for Supporting Actor. One of the resonant themes is seeded as Adonis finds Rocky back in Philadelphia at his restaurant 'Adrianne's' named after his late wife. He wants Rocky to train him as a boxer. Donnie, not yet revealing that he is Apollo's son, asks about his father, 'So how did you beat him?' Rocky confesses, 'Time takes everybody out. It's undefeated.' Rocky is still haunted by Apollo's death in the ring, which he could have stopped. Eventually, Rocky mentors Adonis. 'Creed' is an ode to legacy and those we love. In 1998 Mary Anne Creed (strong and compassionate Phylicia Rashad) adopts the troubled teenage Adonis. He is her husband's son from another woman, born after Apollo's death. From orphan bounced from dozens of foster homes, suddenly Adonis is a Creed living in Los Angeles with wealth and privilege. Now 2015, Adonis is fast rising financial manager, who club fights in Tijuana on the side. He is a self taught boxer with punching power and rage. He is a young man asking, 'Who am I?' Adonis resigns from his job, and tells his 'Mom' (Rashad) that he wants to become a professional boxer. She tells Adonis how she suffered with Apollo's beating in the ring, and does not want him to follow the same path. Unable to find a gym outside his Mother's influence, Adonis moves to Philadelphia to find his father's best friend to train him—Rocky. Rocky trains Adonis. Rocky has long since left the boxing game. He is all alone. Everyone he loved has passed or moved on. Donnie calls Rocky 'Unc', when he eventually means Dad. Adonis finds balance as he falls in love with beautiful musician and singer Bianca (smart and spirited Tessa Thompson), who is also dealing with her own adversity. Jordan displays a gentle and playful side with Thompson. In a funny twist, Bianca outs Adonis for not telling her that his Uncle is Rocky Balboa. As stories collide reigning Light Heavyweight Champion Ricky Conlan (real-life former champion Tony Bellew) has one more fight before serving a prison sentence. His anger costs him a fight with the top contender. Suddenly, he needs to find a legitimate sacrificial opponent. So would that be the son of Apollo Creed? Rocky gets a call and this is all too familiar. Also Adonis and Rocky poignantly deal with mortality. It is life. Time is undefeated. The power of 'Creed' sources from the bond and love of Donnie and Rocky. Jordan is authentic in every moment. He is as convincing throwing a left hook or confessing to Rocky what tortures his soul. Stallone is Rocky. He sees the best in people and inspires them to be great. The boxing in 'Creed' is amazing. Jordan looks awesome, and he is fighting actual world class boxers on screen. Coogler and cinematographer Maryse Alberti display one shot takes in the ring that are electrifying. Not only do you see the punches, you almost feel them. 'Creed' is about legacy and family. As Adonis and Rocky fight for each other we cheer for them and more importantly we cheer for ourselves. Rocky tells Adonis to fight for himself—not anyone else. 'Creed' reminds us to discover the power within in one of the best movies of the year.",10,7,16,26 November 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Surprising 'Wolverine'
","Hugh Jackman is powerful in 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'. 'Wolverine' is the fourth 'X-Men' movie. Jackman as 'Wolverine' may have made the transition to crossover box office movie star. 'Wolverine' works as the modern telling of the classic hero story with Jackman as the tragic hero Logan/Wolverine. In the scene of ultimate betrayal, Logan regrets, 'I ignored my instincts. I ignored who I am. I won't ever let that happen again' For a visually stunning action tale 'Wolverine' has surprising pathos. Director Gavin Hood ('Tsotsi') and writers David Benioff ('Troy') and Skip Woods convey a mesmerizing and compelling story for the first hour. I think the 'Wolverine' narrative falters a bit at the last 10 minutes, because of the comic book mythology constraint. However, in retrospect this is actually fine.Despite this, 'Wolverine' evokes a visceral vengeance tale in the fierce conflict between Logan (Jackman) and his deadly rival Victor Creed (commanding Liev Schreiber), Logan's half-brother. Under the direction of Hood, their battles are bloody and full of rage. At a story arc during a vicious claw wielding struggle Creed commands Logan, 'Do it!' The hero Logan must choose his fate.Hugh Jackman, already anointed 'Sexiest Man Alive 2008', looks incredible, his body is totally shredded. More impressive than his physicality, Jackman awes in his riveting performance as Logan, a man who suffers great tragedy and consumed by tremendous rage. Jackman never tames the animal in Logan, but he manages to humanize him with honor and compassion.'Wolverine' tells the back story of the most captivating character of the 'X-Men' mythology. Logan is a mutant with unheard of regenerative and healing powers, which makes him virtually ageless. He possesses great strength, animal-like reflexes and senses, and claws that retract from his hands. Logan is a killing machine without equal.We learn that Jimmy (Logan) and his half brother Victor are forced to leave their home in 1845 following a family tragedy surrounding Jimmy's discovery of his mutant powers. Logan and Victor fight in the Civil War, World Wars I and II, and the Vietnam War. Recognizing their deadly gifts shadowy William Stryker (deceptively evil Danny Huston) asks Logan and Victor to join his 'special team'. Members include other powerful mutants like Wade Wilson (charming and charismatic Ryan Reynolds) who can split bullets with a katana, and strongman Dukes (good Kevin Durand). During a ruthless mission in Africa, Logan realizes what he may become as he witnesses Victor's fall into the dark abyss. Logan declares, 'I'm done!' Logan finds peace in Canada with the love of his life Kayla (stunningly beautiful and strong Lynn Collins). However, the world can not let Logan be. Col. Stryker and Agent Zero (silently charismatic Daniel Henny) track Logan down. Apparently, someone is brutally killing members of his former team. Grave tragedy soon befalls Logan, and he is consumed by vengeance, 'I'm coming for blood, no code of conduct, no law!' Stryker obliges, 'You will have your revenge.' Logan agrees to become the virtually indestructible Weapon X having Adamantium fused to his skeleton. Discerning certain betrayal by Stryker, Logan now wielding Adamantium claws goes rogue in an electrifying display of berserk rage. However, Logan soon unveils the depth of his betrayal.Writers Benioff and Woods introduce perhaps one too many mutants. Although, some of the characters are engaging, like ally Gambit (strong wise guy Taylor Kitsch). Perhaps, the story's profound strength is Lynn Collins's Kayla. Here Benioff and Woods amaze as Kayla tells Logan the Indian legend of the Moon and the Wolverine. Jackman and Collins have a touching chemistry. We truly believe that Kayla's love calms the beast in Logan. 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' has great story telling and heart pounding action throughout the first half. I think Hood kind of rushes his narrative toward the end which may be more an artifact of the comic book mythology. In the end 'Wolverine' satisfies as the classic hero story, and Hugh Jackman compels as the story's awesome hero.",9,40,71,4 May 2009
Hot Fuzz," Funny Fuzz
","I saw 'Hot Fuzz' a few weeks ago before the big budget summer movies opened in May. Director and Writer Edgar Wright's 'Hot Fuzz' cost a lot less than 'Pirates 3', 'Spider-Man 3', or 'Shrek 3', but is by far the most entertaining and best written movie. 'Hot Fuzz' was apparently this independent British film written by Wright and star Simon Pegg that became a hit in England and Europe. With its wry and clever English humor, and spot on farce of American action movies, this ad hoc dark comedy is outlandishly funny. Part of the genius of Wright and Pegg lulls the audience in the idyllic setting of the English town of Sanford, only to vector into faux satanic cults, mass destruction, and mayhem. A signature moment has Sgt. Nicholas Angel drop kicking shotgun toting grandma in the teeth. 'Hot Fuzz' is admirable in its blindness to taste.Simon Pegg plays Sgt. Nicholas Angel, the London Police Force's decorated super cop. He is so good; he puts the rest of the officers to shame. Consequently, his superiors assign Angel to the quiet town of Sanford which has the distinction of being England's most livable townsomething its township cherishes dearly. Very dearly. No longer in London, Nick no longer makes the rest of the police force look bad. At the same time Nick discovers that his girlfriend has left him for another man. Alone and in culture shock Nick arrives in the sleepy town of Sanford. Nick partners up with Danny Butterman (innocent funny Nick Frost), who is the son of Inspector Frank Butterman (Jim Broadbent). Danny is excited to pair up with real-life action hero Nick. Danny is also a fan of the movies 'Point Break' and 'Bad Boys II'an amazing narrative touch. Danny inquires of Nick, 'Ever fired your gun in the air and yelled, 'Aaaaahhh!'?' Suddenly, Sanford experiences particularly grisly deaths (all darkly comic) in rapid succession. One is a ridiculously inspired impaling at a church. Sgt. Nick Angel suspects murder and focuses his attention on slick super market king, Simon Skinner (the great Timothy Dalton). Apparently, all is not what it seems in idyllic Sanford. Nick unveils a bizarre cult conspiracy. This soon escalates to automatic weapons mayhem in an action movie satire of 'Die Hard'-like proportions.Along the way, Director Wright provides some wacky touches. There is a great sequence in which Nick clears a bar of drinking minors. And Nick and Danny actually watch 'Point Break' and 'Bad Boys II' during a sleep over which is hilarious. The fact that this foreshadows events to come is either sheer genius or just plain disturbing. Simon Pegg is awesome. Even in the abounding chaos Pegg maintains his English reserve and dry wits about himself as Nick Angel. Pegg is so deft at providing a light comic air in the most droll and most distressing moments of his character. Ultimately, this is a parody and Pegg is the believable noble hero. Nick Frost is sidekick genius. As Danny he is the kid on the bench yearning to be the hero. To the movie's credit he is allowed. Timothy Dalton almost steals the movie as the evil Simon Skinner. The former James Bond is such a versatile and talented actor. Here Dalton revels in the role and has so much fun with the over the top villain.'Hot Fuzz' is a great dark comedy. It is well written, clever, and deadly funny. 'Hot Fuzz' is a classic send up of all high decibel action buddy movies. It comically nails all the clichés, and creates some new ones. Simon Pegg is a star. He and Edgar Wright have made a great and entertaining movie for a lot less money than the big summer movies thus far. Someone should take note of this accomplishment.",10,13,23,6 June 2007
Troy," A Tale of Men, not Gods
","Wolfgang Petersen's epic 'Troy' is great spectacle and classic tragedy that enrolls us, due primarily to the performance of the classic movie star, Brad Pitt, in the role of Achilles. Much has been acknowledged regarding David Benioff's screenplay based on Homer's 'The Iliad' that the Greek gods' presence has been omitted in this retelling of the fall of Troy. Also the great warrior Achilles (played by Pitt) is mortal-- more or less. This is left ambiguous with the appearance of his mother, Thetis (a brief Julie Christie), who foretells Achilles' fate. In Greek mythology, Thetis was a god who married Achilles' father, Peleus. Petersen's choice for 'Troy' may be the right one. I did not read Homer's classic poem. Though having Achilles as a great warrior, aware of his mortality, seeking only to serve a noble king makes Achilles' courage and honor poignant. Also given the current state of affairs both 'Troy' and 'The Iliad' remind us of the paradox of war. Early on in 'Troy' Achilles says, 'In war young men die, and old men talk...' Homer's poem told a story of the fall of Troy and the cost of war. Like Homer, Petersen is also telling a story, and he does it well. The Prince of Troy, Paris (Orlando Bloom), flees with Helen, Queen of Sparta (Diane Kruger), away from her husband, Menelaus (Bredan Gleeson). Paris's brother Hector (the charismatic Eric Bana) must protect Paris as they return to Troy. Menelaus is the brother of Agamemnon (Brian Cox), who is king of Greece. As Paris and Hector return to their father, King Priam (a wonderful Peter O'Toole), Menelaus joins forces with Agamemnon, and Odysseus (a very good Sean Bean) to invade Troy to reclaim Menelaus's honor. For Agamemnon this is merely an excuse to add Troy to his empire. However, Troy is a formidable kingdom, so Agamemnon's adviser convinces him to enroll the rogue Achilles in his quest-- a man he respects though despises. Achilles also holds no regard for the king. However, the shiny object for Achilles is that this war will serve as his legacy. Surprisingly, it turns out that this is not really vanity on his part. In an interesting choice, Achilles is introduced as a 'rock star'. He has to be awaken from a drunken orgy, surrounded by gorgeous naked women, to be reminded that a deadly opponent awaits him on the battlefield. He expediently dispatches his hulking adversary, and challenges the other soldiers crying 'Is there no one else?' Brad Pitt is an awesome and charismatic presence. For 'Troy' he got in amazing physical condition-- his body looks phenomenal. He fights expertly with the sword and spear-- the training really shows. His fight scenes are precise, elegant, and brutal. The battle between his Achilles and Eric Bana's Hector is awe inspiring. Pitt is a gifted actor. Along with a fierce intensity, and seeming arrogance to the role, Pitt balances the performance with a sense of fatalism, and an understated compassion. He tells his captive priestess, Briseis (an effective Rose Byrne), that the 'gods wish they were us', because life is invaluable. And there is an moving scene out of 'The Iliad' where Priam (O'Toole) asks Achilles for the body of his son, Hector. Pitt's commanding performance really personalizes and serves this major epic. Aside from Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole's outstanding supporting performances, some of the other critical characters' renderings are distinctly uneven. Orlando Bloom plays Paris as love sick, stupid, and void of courage-- probably the way the character was written. Diane Kruger is stunningly beautiful, but as Helen of Troy, 'the face that launched a thousand ships' something is missing. These two missings are noticeable, because they are critical plot points. Bana as Hector is noble, heroic, and humane-- a great rival and foil to Achilles. O'Toole as Priam brings a touching wisdom and world weariness to the role. He is a great actor. Petersen's 'Troy' is visually stunning. The attention to both detail and the immense scale are a remarkable accomplishment. Though as great as the large battles are, it is the individual battles or conflicts that are most compelling. It is the personal quest of the hero Achilles that matters most. For that, one has to acknowledge the talents of Brad Pitt. 'Troy' is solid storytelling from a great director, Wolfgang Petersen, and has a moving and compelling performance from Brad Pitt.",8,8,15,18 May 2004
Terminator Salvation," A Second Chance
","In 'Terminator Salvation' with his very existence in jeopardy and the entire Human Resistance threatened, powerful and impassioned Christian Bale as leader John Connor declares, 'If we stay the course, we are dead. We are all dead!' Christian Bale is such an intense and explosive presence. He has also been publicized for his personal explosion on the set of 'Terminator Salvation'. Perhaps, this was warranted or not? Bale has since apologized for his lapse in judgment and manners. Bale's passion and intensity elevates Director McG's 'Terminator Salvation'. Up until now, McG's most noteworthy movies were 'Charlie's Angels' and 'Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle'. Being a 'Terminator' fan and a huge fan of the first two movies by James Cameron, hearing about 'Terminator Salvation' seemed bit of a crap shoot. McG does well. The director pays homage to the mythology, and creates a new one particularly in the character of Marcus Wright, brilliantly played by charismatic Sam Worthington. The story by John Brancato, Michael Ferris, and Jonathan Nolan ('The Dark Knight') is action driven and compelling pathos.'Terminator Salvation' works, because Worthington matches Bale's intensity and power. Their styles compliment. Especially from the 'Batman' movies, Bale embodies a fierce internal drive and intelligence. He also balances a sense of compassion in Resistance Leader John Connor. Worthington as Marcus Wright, who may be the demise of Bale's Connor or as he says, 'I'm the only hope you have' is tortured and courageous resolve. Worthington balances strength and vulnerability. At the story arc, John (Bale) asks Marcus (Worthington), 'You think you're human?' Marcus tells Resistance fighter (beautiful and strong Moon Bloodgood), 'Everyone deserves a second chance' This spirit echoes throughout 'Terminator Salvation'. That spirit lightens McG's very dark and violent vision of this Post Apocalyptic world.The Terminator machines in the movie are amazing, and the action sequences are pulse pounding thrill rides. There is a spectacular scene where a Skynet drone demolishes a bridge during a high speed chase. And in the climax, the battle with Bale, Worthington, and the 'old school' Terminator is very cool.We first meet Marcus Wright in 2003, prior to his execution. He literally signs his life away to dying Dr. Kogan (frighteningly frail Helena Bonham Carter), who works for Cyberdyne Systems. In the Terminator mythology, Cyberdyne designed Skynet as the ultimate autonomous defense system. However, when Skynet is deployed the system becomes sentient and causes the nuclear holocaust, Judgment Day.Now 2018, Kyle Reese (spirited Anton Yelchin) rescues wondering Marcus from Terminator attack in the Los Angeles wasteland. He says, 'Come with me, if you want to live!' There are pockets of Resistance scattered throughout the remainder of the world. Kyle Reese, though a teenager, will become the father of John Connor (Bale)—part of the narrative paradox. Marcus and John are destined to meet. But are they defining heroes, or tragic rivals in the ultimate conflict? Bale and Worthington are awesome in this matching of wills and humanity. The supporting cast is strong for the most part. Moon Bloodgood is great as Marcus's friend Blair Williams. Anton Yelchin has that youthful zeal as Kyle Reese. Bryce Dallas Howard seems miscast as John's pregnant and loving wife Kate. She does not provide the movie's emotional anchor.In the end, 'Terminator Salvation' is worth watching, because of the great hero story and the powerful performances by Bale and Worthington. The shining objects are the metallic machines and rumbling explosions, but what compels is the human story from the hearts of Bale and Worthington.",9,5,9,25 May 2009
Juno," Great Juno
","As 'Juno' opens, Juno MacGuff played by Ellen Page downs a gallon of Sunny D, while lamenting the chair where it all started. Juno is filling up, so she can verify a drug store pregnancy testfor the third time. Director Jason Reitman's 'Juno' catches you completely off guard in a bitter sweet and moving tale about living with life choices. 'Juno' is perhaps the best movie of the year. Reitman also directed the excellent 'Thank You for Smoking'. With 'Juno' the same wit shines along with a touching humanity. 'Juno' is so smart, maybe a bit too smart at times with the crisp and biting dialog of Diablo Cody's amazing screenplay. Even some of the smartest people around, don't routinely create such stinging rifts. Regardless, the effect is hysterical as 'Juno' celebrates the best in people. The greatest thing in life is when the people closest to you surprise you with their loyalty, compassion, and love. Yes, 'Juno' is about a pregnant 16 year-old girl out to correct an error in judgment. However, it is not about the pregnancy itself, rather who the people become as they step up or not.Applaud 'Juno' for being very smart, embodied by the heroine Juno played by the remarkable Ellen Page. After Juno tells her father Mac (J.K. Simmons) and step mom Bren (Alison Janney), that she is pregnant and the father is Bleeker (Michael Cera), she confesses to her Dad, 'I really don't know what kind of girl I am.' The punch line is that her parents expected it. Bren admits that she was hoping the issue was that Juno was expelled or she was 'into hard drugs'. Ellen Page is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nomination. She is brilliant. She personifies Juno as this very smart and smart ass-ed kid who makes a mistake, and takes a responsible course of action. In a wonderful moment Bren (Janney) cautions the ultrasound technician to mind her judgment, because even her 'stupid ass step daughter' could raise her child, but she has wisely chosen to give the baby a more capable couple.Juno finds the ideal couple: Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner). Juno located Mark and Vanessa in a PennySaver ad. Juno and her Dad meet the Lorings' and their attorney. Juno is a little chagrinedshe would like to 'kick this old school' with the baby basket and Moses river deal. Mark and Vanessa seem the 'Stepford' couple. However, fissures in their relationship are exposed. Vanessa (Garner) seems wound a few degrees too tighteven for type A. Her desire to be a mother is all consuming and humorless. Mark (Bateman) is the cool and supportive husband, but unhappy just below the surface. He composes music for commercials. He and Juno, also a wannabe guitarist, form a friendship.Meanwhile, Juno is a pregnant 16 year-old making it through high school on her resounding spirit and smarts. This soon is not enough. She wonders what will happen with her and Bleeker (Cera). The Lorings' are not what she expected, too. There is the wonderful conversation Juno has with her Dad, 'Why can't two people stay together forever?' This is hysterical and touching all at the same timean epiphany for Juno and the audience. Ultimately, Juno is about finding true love and copping when it is gone. In a great line Juno says, 'He is the cheese to my macaroni.' Rietman is natural and understated in his direction. All the performances are compelling and amazing. T.K. Simmons is the perfect Dad, who keeps surprising with his irreverent compassion and strength. Alison Janney is awesome. Her Bren is smart, funny, and unexpectedly loyal to Juno. Michael Cera gets the right balance of geek and big hearted. Jason Bateman is greathe is subtle in his charm and suffering. Jennifer Garner is a total surprise playing against type. Her Vanessa is nearly insufferable, but Garner imposes her humanity that transcends the taut character. There is a moving scene where she feels Juno's baby kick. Ellen Page is vulnerable, smart, and hysterical. Page is an amazing actor. She completely captivates 'Juno'.'Juno' is one of the year's best. 'Juno' refreshingly and humorously tells a story of the very best in people as they step up in life, and of true love. Definitely see 'Juno' and be surprised.",10,2,9,29 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Almost World's End
","In the much awaited appearance by Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father Captain Teague, he says to Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), 'It's not about living forever that's the problem, Jacky. It's about living with yourselfforever.' That is an awesome line and a touching moment, but like much of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' it is woefully out of context. Context is not the strong suit of Director's Gore Verbinski's 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'. Admittedly, I did not see 'Pirates 2', and 'Pirates 3' is a mess. Granted it is visually spectacular and state-of-the-art stunning, but much like the other third legs of the other summer trilogies 'Pirates 3' is running on vapors. Johnny Depp is great as Captain Jack Sparrow. Perhaps, he is the only reason to endure the movie's 2 hours and 47 minutes. The movie is way too long. Depp is supported by amazing actors in this marathon sequel. Keira Knightley is very strong and beautiful as Elizabeth Swann. I think that it is all right for Knightley to add some carbs back into her diet. She impressively pulls off the action hero role. Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush is at his treacherous best as Captain Barbossa. In comparison Orlando Bloom is weak as Will Turner. However, Bloom does muster enough charisma to salvage the love story with Knightley. Much of this shipwreck falls squarely on the army of writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert. The sheer mass of writers points to the lack of a single narrative voice, and patched work storytelling. 'Pirates 3' will set box office records around the world, but it is disappointing given all the talent involved.As 'Pirates 3' resumes from last time, Barbossa, Turner, and Swann are out to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker at World's End. They must also all face Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) in a showdown, and the Flying Dutchman's armada commanded by Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander). Will Turner (Bloom) also seeks to free his father from Davy Jones. Davy Jones himself seeks justice from his scorned lover Calypso (Naomie Harris). The 9 pirate Captains reluctantly form an alliance to battle Lord Beckett. And finally, will Elizabeth marry Will before all this is done? Who cares? Even piecing storyline together, the movie is a wild ride and almost impossible to follow. 'Pirates 3' also gets very weird. The whole 'stone crabs' indulgence in Davy Jones Locker is completely bizarre. Amidst all the inept chaos, Johnny Depp remains captivating as Jack. Depp masterfully switches between wacky and aloof to compelling hero. But even this grows weary, because ultimately there is no story to tell.'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' will do just fine in terms of box office and business. The movie is entertaining and fun, but it is way too long and really runs on fumes after the first half hour. What is disappointing is that 'Pirates 3' wastes the talents of Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. The trilogy deserved a better finish. If you don't have a compelling need to see the movie wait for 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' on DVD when you can view using appropriate refrigerator breaks.",7,0,2,2 June 2007
Deadpool 2," F is for Family in 'Deadpool 2'
","'Deadpool 2' is hysterical, whimsically crass, electrifying action, and despite superfluous intentions: 'Deadpool 2' is about family. Sweet surprise. Ryan Reynolds is the mercurial snarky reluctant hero Deadpool and his human persona Wade Wilson. Wade possesses amazing mutant regenerative powers and martial arts skills. Josh Brolin is Cable, the mechanically armed cyborg from the future, seeking to alter the time line; thus, erasing his own personal tragedy. Wade's heartbroken cynicism and Cable's dour intensity compose this unique Yin and Yang of Director David Leitch's eclectic 'Deadpool 2'. Leitch has a masterful eye for martial arts execution as displayed in 'John Wick' and 'Atomic Blonde'. Brolin's Cable and Reynolds's Deadpool go full throttle in vicious throw down, upon each other or in tandem thrashing a villain horde. With all the spectacular shoot 'em eye candy, gaudy CGI battles, and cleverer than thou self-conscious pop culture references the story by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds discovers genuine gravitas in its conventional heart: What is it to be a family? At the narrative arc Vanessa, played by beautiful soulful Morena Baccarin, tells her lover Wade, 'Kids give us a chance of being better than we use to be.' In this 'Deadpool 2' emerges greater. 'Deadpool 2' is more of the same hyperbole action sequences and smart aleck sensibility. Yet, Wade experiences profound loss and discovers his purpose in saving suffering young mutant Russell, played by innocently brave Julian Dennison, who commands fiery flames through his hands. In all its misdirects and the comic narrative obsession for Wolverine and Hugh Jackman, 'Deadpool' is really about family and love. Deadpool himself would rather vomit in his confession. He forms the 'X-Force' to complete his mission to save Russell's soul and the future's well-being. Strong mesmerizing Zazie Beetz as Domino, whose mutant prowess is luck, comments on the team's name: 'Isn't that a little derivative?' Exactly. Zazie is total kick ass and a star. Domino. Cable. Deadpool. Russell. Family doesn't necessarily have to look a certain way. But you know when you are one. Reynolds beautifully balances aloof smarter than thou and big-hearted hero. He is literally stifled in that red mask. Yet, Leitch wisely exposes Ryan's well of emotions when unmasked. Wade tells tearful Russell, 'You're a good kid...' Deadpool reveals his own truth. Through all his bluster and irreverence, he knows that we all deserve kindness. Josh Brolin is Ryan's understatedly powerful foil. In contrast to motor mouth Wade, his Cable's selected words command gravity. He moves us as he speaks of 'the most pain' you will ever know. 'Deadpool 2' is loud, smart aleck hysterical and total over the top carnage. No surprise. What surprises: It's sense of humanity. Seems even Deadpool knows that Hero is about family. Hero is about love. He might even say that with a straight face, if you could see his face. Just saying.",10,5,11,21 May 2018
Spider-Man 3," A Shell of Spider-Man
","'Spider-Man 3' feels 2 hours and 20 minutes long. Returning Director and Writer Sam Raimi along with co-writers Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent seem to be running on fumes in this third installment of the Spider-Man tale. Uncharacteristically, the storytelling is messy. There are way too many villains: New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom. Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) journey into Darth Vader territory, down the dark side ends up more repulsive instead of sympathetic. This is a critical miscalculation. Maguire's earnest and strong performance as Peter and Spider-Man barely salvages 'Spider-Man 3'. Overall, 'Spider-Man 3' is well crafted and visually spectacularthat's all. I loved 'Spider-Man 2'. I thought that 'Spider-Man 2' was not only a great sequel, but also a great movie on its own. 'Spider-Man 2' had the great scene with Aunt May saying, 'I believe there is a hero in all of us' That story was all about inspired greatness and being a hero. 'Spider-Man 3' seems to have forgotten that cultural context. Although pretty to look at, 'Spider-Man 3' is a shell with glossy veneer. This is a little disappointing coming from the talented Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire.In 'Spider-Man 3' the opening narration by Peter (Maguire) astonishingly sounds full of himself; thus, hinting the hero's pitfall. Peter seems to believe his own press clippings. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead on a Broadway show. Peter is thinking about asking MJ to marry him. Freelance news photographer Peter has a rival in smarmy Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). And he also has potential rival for his affections in the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Harry Osborn (James Franco) has sworn vengeance upon Peter and Spider-Man for the death of his father. To add to the convolution, escaped criminal Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) goes through a surprising transformation in a scientific mishap. Marko may also be involved in the murder of Peter's Uncle Ben. Finally, an extra-terrestrial parasite infects Peter. This galactic symbiotic creature unbridles everyone's darker nature.'Spider-Man 3' aspires for greatness. However, it is off focus, clunky and kluged. The strong performances by Maguire, Harris, and Franco are really left in a lurch without a compelling story. Fortunately, Raimi's narrative focuses near the end. Though clumsy throughout, I believe Raimi wanted to tell his story of forgiveness. Visually, the movie is stunning. The opening aerial battle between Peter and New Goblin (Fanco) is breathtaking. The inconsistent and bewildering Sandman effects are technical marvels. A lot of money was spent making 'Spider-Man' look great. What would have served the movie might have been less villains and perhaps a cathartic examination of our own dark side. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker. However, in his darker manifestation the normally engaging Maguire is not at all sympathetic. The misstep is almost costly, because of the inherent semi-comic tone. Maguire's innate earnestness and calm retrieve this from the abyss. On the other hand Kirsten Dunst comes off very whiny as MJ. Granted her character's life is not going as she had wished; she is still unpleasant. James Franco is charismatic as Harry.'Spider-Man 3' has some spectacular action scenes. It is in its quiet moments void of 'sound and fury' that the movie fails. There is not a compelling story to tell here. This comment really has no merit in the big picture. 'Spider-Man 3' has as a shot at becoming the biggest grossing movie of all time. Perhaps, with all the returning talent in the inevitable 'Spider-Man 4' Raimi and company can recapture the greatness of the classic hero tale that moves and inspires.",8,2,5,12 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor gets it right in 'Ragnarok'
","'Thor: Ragnarok' rocks as the best 'Thor'. Chris Hemsworth is hysterical and heroic as the God of Thunder in Director Taika Waititi's 'Ragnarok' which refers to the Norse mythology's End of Days. This is the delightful narrative recreation in the screenplay by Eric Pearson, Craig Kyle, and Christopher Yost. Yet as whimsical as the movie becomes with Thor battling his Avengers mate The Hulk in the gladiator arena on planet Sakaar saying 'Yes! We know each other. He's a friend from work!', 'Thor: Ragnarok' underlines hero and family. Tom Hiddleston and Anthony Hopkins are both funny and poignant in that capacity.Hopkins returns as Norse god Odin. His first born daughter Hela, Goddess of Death, regally malevolent Cate Blanchett, returns from Odin's banishment in vengeance imposing Ragnarok upon Asgard. In the touching scene in Norway, Odin tells his warring prodigal sons Thor and Loki, charismatic Tom Hiddleston, 'I love you.' While escaping from Sakaar, Thor tells Loki he thought growing up that they would 'fight side by side forever'. That was not to be. Loki is who he is.With the impending conflict with his sister the Goddess of Death, Thor seeks out Odin in the realm of dreams. Thor says, 'I am not as strong as you!' Odin reminds, 'No, you're stronger.' Waititi pokes fun and creates amazing visuals of distant worlds, but never forgets what moves are heroes and love. In his recurrent theme, Thor says, 'Because that's what heroes do.' 'Thor: Ragnarok' may make you laugh out loud in irreverence as Thor and Hulk talk about being 'hotheads'. Yet, 'Ragnarok' is about reclaiming one's greatness and family. Chris Hemsworth is awesome. He looks like a Norse god: handsome, chiseled body, and with his long blonde locks shorn. He has great comedic timing and delivery. His Thor reveals as self-deprecating, funny and humbled by circumstance. Hemsworth's Hero emerges in his vulnerability. This comical saga of good and evil compels with Cate Blanchett, who is formidable evil power in Hela. Blanchett is beautiful in sleek wardrobe, antlered helmet, onyx mane, and Goth eyes. Cate restrains from total camp by harnessing some of Hela's fury within. Hela was the merciless warrior in Odin's bloody wars that united the '8 Realms'. She embraced her darkness which resulted in her exile as Odin reinvented peace for Asgard. Blanchett brilliantly nuances Hela's rage and betrayal. She easily disposes hundreds of Asgard warriors. She even shatters Thor's Might Hammer like glass, as seen in movie trailers. Thor may not be strong enough to defeat Hela's great evil. In silly convoluted fashion Thor and Loki end up captive on the planet Sakaar, the kingdom of the Grandmaster, played by goofy in a good way Jeff Goldblum, as the self-styled Emperor Nero. Thor becomes the Grandmaster's gladiator challenging his champion, the Hulk and his human persona David Banner, played by genius straight man Mark Ruffalo. Thor and Hulk discover the unexpected ally in surviving warrior Valkyrie, strong smart Tessa Thompson. The Valkyrie are the women warrior protectors of Asgard in Norse mythology. Perhaps, the romantic interest for Thor, Thompson is fun and total kick ass. Eventually, 'Thor: Ragnarok' reverts to its superhero DNA. Though it is a wild fun ride with a lot of laughs and welcome poignant turns. Thor does what heroes do—fight against great evil not knowing whether good will prevail. The good man or god in this case fights on as opposed to doing nothing in the face of evil. Hemsworth and Blanchett lend gravitas to Director Waittit's whimsical take on the classic battle of good and evil in the universe where heroes and family count. 'Thor: Ragnarok' is great fun.",9,12,22,6 November 2017
Yes Man," Say 'Yes' to 'Yes Man'
","'Yes Man' is surprisingly good, and here the punch line is everything. Jim Carrey is great in Director Peyton Reed's hysterical romantic comedy. Zooey Deschanel is amazingly charming and quirky. In 'Yes Man' Carrey plays Carl, who has been divorced for 3 years from Stephanie (flighty and hot Molly Sims) and has an uninspired job as a loan officer at Brea Savings in Los Angeles. Carl has pretty much checked out in life. To that end he says 'No' to all invites. Carl even forgets to attend his best friend Peter's (funny Bradley Cooper) engagement party. An old buddy invites Carl to a seminar given by Tony Robbins-like self help guru Terrence Bundley (charismatic Terrence Stamp). Terrence invites Carl to accept the 'covenant' to say 'Yes' to everything in life. Reluctantly, Carl accepts.However, there is a point to the screenplay by Nicholas Stoller, Jarrad Paul, and Andrew Mogel based on the book by Danny Wallace. In a great conversation with Carl and Terrence later in the story Carl asks, 'So this is bullsh*t?' Carl has been so not present in his own life. Obviously, saying 'Yes' mindlessly to everything is ridiculous. What if taking on saying 'Yes' as an operating practice is a way of practicing being enrolled in life. When you are enrolled in life, and become enrolling, you are now open to a new realm of possibility. Reed and his writers present this transformed perspective in both a hysterical and touching manner.Saying 'Yes' immediately does not seem to make a difference for Carl. Carl ends up giving a ride and all of his money to Homeless Guy (funny Brent Briscoe). With his cell phone dead and his car empty on gas, Carl ventures miles to a gas station where he meets free-spirited scooter girl Allison (Deschanel). Allison gives Carl a ride, and leaves an indelible mark on his heart. In not the most linear or obvious ways, Carl soon embraces saying 'Yes'. Peter asks, 'So you say 'yes' to everything?' Carl confesses, 'I wasn't open to stuff. Now I am' Carl eventually is fated to meet up with Allison. Carl tells Peter that 'She is so not me.' There in lies the genius. There is a quiet moment at the Hollywood Bowl where Allison tells Carl, 'The whole world is a playground. Somewhere along the way everyone forgets that' Here Reed is unexpectedly poignant. Carrey and Zooey's sweet and funny chemistry give 'Yes Man' its big heart.'Yes Man' is hysterical. Carrey is at his best playing outrageous comedic with an underlying humanity, instead of straight up serious drama. He is amazingly hysterical as he serenades a Jumper (funny Luis Guzman), takes a drunken beating from an angry boyfriend, and jacked up on Red Bull in a jogging photography class. Zooey Deschanel is Carrey's amazing romantic foil. There is a nice scene as she and Carrey walk side by side along a barren Nebraska road. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit and vulnerability. So her Allison must touchingly reconcile for herself whether Carl is just saying 'Yes'. 'Yes Man' is about what's in your heart and being open to all the possibilities of life. That's not a bad message for a hilarious and outrageous comedy from Jim Carrey and Peyton Reed. Say 'Yes' to 'Yes Man'.",9,21,27,3 January 2009
The Prestige," The game for the young
","Before Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) travels to Colorado to find scientist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Cutter (Michael Caine), magician mentor, tells Angier, 'Obsession is the game of young men' In Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' obsession spirals into deadly rivalry. The Prestige refers to the Third Act of a magic trick. In Act One: The Pledge shows the ordinary. In Act Two: The Turn, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. In Act Three: The Prestige, the twist occurs and we see something shocking. Writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's 'The Prestige', based on Christopher Priest's novel, embodies these three acts. The third act of 'The Prestige' is a shocking surprise. While watching 'The Prestige' I guessed half of the twist, but not everything, and was completely mesmerized by the end. 'The Prestige' starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is an engrossing dark tale of revenge that is one of the year's best.I had read that Priest's novel had an innovative narrative style where the story is retold by the rival magicians Angier and Borden, wherein the truth is revealed. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan unveil a captivating yarn through exchanged diariessee the movie. We are clued in from the on set, when Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) instructs us, 'Watch closely' In the beginning Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) are young magicians under the tutelage of Cutter (Caine). Angier's beautiful wife Julia (Piper Perabo) is a magician's assistant. However, in a magic trick turned fatal, Angier and Borden transform into enemies obsessed with revenge. Their obsession escalates into apparent murder. 'The Prestige' perfectly casts with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Jackman and Bale are among the screen's most powerful actors. It is interesting and not coincidence that Jackman and Bale have achieved acclaims playing superheroes: Jackman as Wolverine in the 'X-Men' movies; Bale as Batman in 'Batman Begins'. However, there are no heroes in 'The Prestige'. Director Nolan brilliantly leverages their contrasting styles and intensity. Tony Winner Jackman plays the brilliant showman Angier, who is talented, but smart enough to sense that Borden may be the more gifted magician. His hatred for Borden is boundless, even dismissing his assistant and lover Olivia (very good Scarlett Johansson) to discover Borden's secrets. Borden (Bale) is the brooding pure student of magiche has the eye. Borden marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and they eventually have a daughter Jess (cute Sammantha Mahurin). However, good woman Sarah suffers in the relationship of secrets. Borden becomes a star with his 'Transported Man' trick. The jealous Angier believes that Borden is performing true magic. After several twists and turns, Angier is convinced that his own quest for 'true magic' lies with Nikola Tesla (Bowie), the Father of Magnetism. The true magic he seeks is apparently, science.Christopher Nolan ('Memento', 'Batman Begins') infuses a sense of wonder and tragedy in his dark tale. Ultimately, his 'The Prestige' is about the cost of losing one's soul on the path of vengeance and fame. Hugh Jackman is simply powerful. As Angier he is a man whose life takes a dark turn, and becomes obsessed discarding almost all of his humanity. Jackman's intensity and vulnerability make Angier's quest sympathetic, but never enrolling. Jackman is masterful and charismatic in this balancing act. He has a commanding presence and voice. His performance is Oscar worthy. Equally powerful is Christian Bale as the conversely internalized Borden. His Borden is the consummate magician, always creating. Bale's intense understated performance hints at the anger and drive just below the surface. Jackman and Bale have an amazing screen partnership that is a paradox of styles. The scenes where both discover that they have been betrayed are stunning. Michael Caine is awesome as usual. Here he wonderfully floats between the two leads. His final alliance is a complete surprise. David Bowie is absolutely great as Nikola Tesla, a completely original character.Nolan's 'The Prestige' is an unsettling tale of revenge and deadly rivalry. Nolan navigates many twists and turns arriving upon an electrifying surprise in this story of all consuming obsession. Jackman and Bale each give their best performance in Nolan's parable of forfeited souls. 'The Prestige' is one of the year's best movies.",10,5,9,22 October 2006
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Can't smile without you...
","My bud Lauren, asked me if 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army' was worth seeing. I told him where else would you see Hellboy (Ron Perlman)hulking red monster guy, and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones)slender amphibian guy both drunk on beer and singing Barry Manilow's 'Can't Smile Without You'one of the greatest love songs of the Twentieth Century. You've got to acknowledge Director and Writer Guillermo del Toro for his full throttle, outrageous, and stylishly weird 'Hellboy II: The Golden Army'. These further adventures of Red (Hellboy) are based on Mike Mignola's comic book. Ron Perlman reprising Hellboy is awesome. He has the right balance of gruff smart ass and reluctant superhero down. Hellboy is a charismatic, wisecracking, and muscled out hero. It has been 5 years since we last saw Red: we find that his relationship with the love of his life Liz (strong and quirky Selma Blair) maybe down for the count. Liz bares a secret, she is not sure she should disclose to Hellboy.However, this is the least of their worries. Two pieces to the legendary triad have been usurped by the powerful Prince Nuada (noble and strong Luke Goss), the white maned martial arts blade wielding warrior. The triad is the dismantled crown of King BalorNuada's father. The one who possesses the Crown, commands The Golden Army, the most deadly soldiers in the world. The Crown was dismantled in the truce between the humans and the 'immortals'. What these fantastical beings are is a little confusing, if not completely nebulous. Oh, well this may become clearer on a repeat viewingor not. Prince Nuada needs to recover the third piece. The secret to the whereabouts may lie with his twin sister Princess Nuala (gentle and strangely beautiful Anna Walton).Seeking to stop Nuada are Hellboy, Liz, Abe, who embody the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, the shadow organization which specializes in defeating the creepy and fantastical. Headed by Tom Manning (hysterical Jeffrey Tambor), the Bureau is in dire need of a public relations makeover. Enter Johann Krauss (Seth MacFarlane), a German accented protoplasmic vapor encased in a retro diving suit. There is logic somewhere in this thread-- somewhere. Del Toro masterfully corners the market on the weird.The brilliant and mannered Abe (excellent Doug Jones) researches the mythology of The Golden Army, and eventually finds himself in love with Nuala (Walton). Hence, we have the drunken Manilow singing display. Prince Nuada is perhaps the unbeatable warrior. Is Hellboy a match for the great Prince? Can Hellboy stop The Golden Army, and still restore his relationship with Liz (Blair)? Well, you just have to watch the movie. Before the dramatic battle between Red and Nuada, Red says with bravado and disgust, 'I won't kill him. I'm gonna kick his ass!' The final conflict is visually spectacular. Like all the action and visuals in 'Hellboy II', they are exquisitely executed just over the top. 'Hellboy II' is perfect stylish and spirited camp. What makes it all work is that Ron Perlman makes you root for Hellboy. 'Hellboy II' is not the greatest movie of the year with its confusing narrative elements and blazing pace. However, it is one of the more enjoyable escapes of the summer. Sit back and enjoy the ride.",8,3,8,15 July 2008
Ready Player One," What we really have...
","Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' is somewhat the paradox, in both good and no so great ways. As 'Ready Player One' opens, we see Ohio in 2045 with vertically stacked trailer homes. It's the home to 18 year-old Wade, played by Tye Sheridan. All the while we hear 'Jump' by Van Halen from their '1984' album, back from my youth. Spielberg orchestrates nostalgia for 1980's and '90's culture, which reveals as part of Zak Penn and Ernest Cline's screen narrative based on Cline's 2011 novel. The worthwhile message that what we have is our reality, and risking yourself gives life is nearly lost in 2 hours and 20 minutes of visual spectacle eye candy, and intense action for thrill sake near the end. 'Ready Player One' tells the story of the perils of the constructed virtual reality world called OASIS, where game created avatars compete to discover the 3 Keys. Possession of those Keys grant the victor reign of OASIS from its late Creator Halliday, played by gentle suffering Mark Rylance. Master gamer Wade's avatar is cool handsome Parzival. His intimate rival is beautiful free-spirited Art3mis, played by strong vulnerable Olivia Cooke, who intends to beat him. Much of the story occurs in the virtual OASIS, where authentic risk, danger, and even love are not necessarily real. Or are they? This where 'Ready Player One' falters somewhat. Although, the visual imagery evokes that sense of wonder in the amazing motorcycle races, and cool high tech. Wonder lies in the love story of Parzival and Art3mis. Dancing together in the air of the rave-like club, Art3mis cautions Parzival that he doesn't really see or know her. That he might be disappointed. That discovery in the real world is the most intriguing and human story. In that world Wade poignantly says, 'I'm not disappointed...' That made the movie for me. I think Steven Spielberg seems so compelled to marvel the audience in the thrills of OASIS, instead of trusting the unique humanity of Sheridan and Cooke. Love stories really move. Spectacular visual CGI effects and lifelike human capture amaze, but are essentially narrative gravy. 'Ready Player One' is the tale of the brilliant man, who didn't risk falling in love and regretted that for the rest of his life. Consequently, he created the virtual world OASIS where he could simulate the greater he never risked. And the rest of the future world in 2045 embraced living that virtual life as opposed to the real one. Perhaps, this is our caution for the obsession of virtual reality games, social media and similar constructs. Toward the end 'Ready Player One' bogs down in gamer war and chases. The movie could have easily been half an hour shorter. Fortunately, Tye and Olivia's collective humanity remind of the purpose of it all. What we really have is reality in life. And what makes that all worth it, is taking a risk and having faith.",8,1,4,4 April 2018
"I, Tonya"," Not a monster...
","'I, Tonya' is amazing. Margot Robbie gifts a career defining performance. Margot plays disgraced 1994 US Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. Her performance as Tonya is fearless, vulnerable, sad and poignantly flawed. Harding is notorious for knowing about the attack upon US figure skating Champion Nancy Kerrigan which led to her eventual ban from competitive skating which was her life. Director Craig Gillespie neither vilifies nor justifies Tonya offering the experience of being her. That she wanted to be loved, to be gotten, and to be the best. At the time Tonya was the only women's figure skater in the world to land the impossible triple axel in competition. Robbie as Tonya in an interview in the movie acknowledged when she landed the triple axel in the trials she knew, 'I was the best!' Tonya was driven, the figure skating phenom, but she was less than phenom in her life. I think that is the poignancy of Gillespie's direction and Steven Rogers's story. 'I, Tonya' is not really dark comedy. 'I, Tonya' is just dark with laughs in its irony and the stupidity of those closest to Tonya. The movie is the dichotomy that defines the tragedy of domestic violence and abuse. In one scene Tonya's husband Jeff, played by convincing Sebastian Stan, slams the freezer door in Tonya's face, because she questions why he didn't buy Dove ice cream bars. That is so wrong. That makes you so angry. Gillespie depicts that pattern of abuse throughout of beating on screen. And Tonya takes it, and stays until she can no longer. The abuse originates with Mom LaVona, played by focused Allison Janney, who thinks she is tough love as she pushes her daughter in her skating career. No, Mom is an abuser. Janney's LaVona could have been comic caricature; instead she brilliantly nuances the single Mom working waitress raising her kid the way she was raised. Robbie is touching humanity as Tonya, who has the self awareness that she is uneducated, but she is smarter than she thinks and way smarter than those surrounding her. 'I, Tonya' and Robbie in contrasts of edgy humor and human cruelty touchingly tells the story of how we are raised and the people we choose to spend life with either define or curse. Much about Tonya seems to be the in order to, to prove something. In the great scene before her competition her new Coach Doty, played by strong Bojana Novakovic, tells her 'You show them.' That I think becomes the conversation that dominates Tonya's life. Needing her Mom's help after she leaves husband Jeff, Tonya sees her Mom. She asks her Mom that when she was a kid, 'Did you love me?' Robbie's Tonya is in tears. That breaks your heart. Really Tonya just wanted to be loved, like we all do. That may be the point of Gillespie's 'I, Tonya' with all its emotional extremes and uncomfortable laughs. Perhaps, most of the laughs come from the blatant stupidity of Jeff and his idiot friend Shawn, played by good Paul Walter Hauser. Maybe 'I, Tonya' works in its profound sadness as well. Toward the end Tonya says, 'I am not a monster.' No, she's not. She is just the little girl who wanted to be loved and never got it. She was driven and wanted to be the best. Tonya is just human. She is both lightness and darkness. Perhaps within 'I, Tonya' are loud laughs and the subtle lesson of having compassion. 'I, Tonya' is one of my favorite movies of the year.",10,74,97,15 January 2018
Moana," 'Moana' Finding What She Is Meant to Be
","Disney's 'Moana' is visually spectacular and fun. The blue oceans, the lush tropical islands, and beautiful Polynesian people are vibrantly created in state of the art animation. The songs co-written by Lin- Manuel Miranda of Broadway 'Hamilton' fame have a Hawaiian flavor and engaging lyrics. Dwayne Johnson voices Demigod Maui with the gusto of The Rock from his WWE days. He almost steals 'Moana' with his comical zeal and authentic introspection. Newcomer Auli'i Cravalho is enchanting as Moana. She is a young star with a fabulous voice. I grew up in Hawaii and was familiar with some of the Hawaiian mythology. Demigod Maui was the way finder who pulled up the Hawaiian Islands from the ocean with his great fishing hook. 'Moana' is enjoyable and superbly entertaining. Ironically, while the brave way finders discovered the vast unknown, 'Moana' ventures into familiar seas. Jared Bush wrote the screenplay for 'Moana' from the story by Ron Clements, John Musker, Chris Williams, Don Hall and 3 others. Perhaps too many writers. They wrote this kluged narrative and predictable story. This is unfortunate on several levels. 'Moana' is an homage to Polynesian culture which is rarely depicted in even live-action movies. This is an empowerment tale about the rites of passage of the young girl Moana (Cravalho), heir apparent Chieftain. 'Moana' echoes the sacred bond of man and the earth. The story albeit inspiring has been done before. Maui (Johnson) says 'High five.' and 'Got your back.' The colloquialisms seem out of place for an ancient tale that is a couple thousand years old. Directors Ron Clements and John Musker smooth out the journey joyously with visuals and song. In the story, Chief Tui (proud and strong Temuera Morrison)—Moana's father, forbid anyone to sail beyond the Island's reef. To save the Island and her people, Moana sails beyond the reef into the great ocean to find Maui. Metaphorically, 'Moana' might have done the same as its hero, throwing caution to the wind and risking the great unknown.'Moana' opens as Gramma Tala (strong and gentle Rachel House) tells the story to children of how Maui stole the heart of Te Fiti (Island Goddess). The heart is a green stone that possesses the life force. Upon escaping Maui battles the lava monster Te Ka, and he along with his fishing hook and the heart of Te Fiti are vanquished into to the depths of the sea. In a recurrent Disney signature the story scares the children; all except little Moana. Then the ocean poetically anoints Moana as the chosen one for the heart of Te Fiti. Years pass and Moana's Island is dying—the fishing and crops depleted. Gramma Tala reveals to Moana (Cravalho) she is the one who must return the heart of Te Fiti, and find Maui. To complete the quest she breaks her Father's law to sail beyond the reef. Wise Tala enlightens Moana that she will find what she is meant to be. Johnson and Cravalho charm as the unlikely partners—the woman chieftain and the demigod in redemption. Cravalho voices Moana's strength amidst her self-doubt. She is an awesome singer. The song 'How Far I'll Go' is moving. Johnson also can carry a tune as Maui. He brings a playful pompousness to the hulking kind of squishy tattooed Maui—so unlike his real chiseled persona. He also displays a compassionate vulnerability, especially when he tells how he became the demigod. He and Cravalho have wonderful chemistry, and give 'Moana' its big heart. We pull for Maui and Moana on their treacherous journey. They are finding who they are meant to be. That really matters for us. Although familiar, 'Moana' has brilliant song, amazing sights, and true soul. Enjoy.",8,2,13,2 December 2016
Crash," Crash Touches
","Few movies are thought provoking. Paul Haggis's 'Crash' is conscience provoking. In the opening scene of 'Crash' Don Cheadle as Detective Graham says, 'In L.A. nobody touches you.' Director Paul Haggis and co-writer Robert Moresco touch and inspire in their stark and uncompromising story of bigotry, racism, and prejudice. Haggis and Moresco illustrate through the chaos of colliding characters the prejudice that exists in all of us. Prejudice is not really good or bad, rather it just doesn't work. Haggis and Moresco also celebrate the possibility of the best in peoplethe part that is noble, courageous, selfless, and forgiving. In his directorial debut, Paul Haggis is bold and brilliant. The cast which includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terrance Howard, Brendan Fraser, Thandie Newton, and Ryan Phillipe is impeccable.With its intertwining narrative threads 'Crash' is truly the director's medium. Haggis is uncompromising in his portrait of prejudice in both broad and subtle strokes. The effect is powerful. Two young black men, Anthony (Ludacis) and Peter (Larenz Tate), carjack the Navigator owned by district attorney Rick (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). Following a lead on the stolen Navigator, police officers Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Hanson (Ryan Phillipe) stop Navigator driver Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his beautiful wife Christine (Thandie Newton) for really no good reason. Ryan crosses the line and literally violates Christine in front of an impotent Cameron. Persian store owner Farhad (Shaun Toub) and his daughter Shereen are labeled Arab by a gun store owner when they purchase a handgun to protect Farhad's store. Hispanic locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena) is dismissed by an angry Farhad, when Daniel recommends that he repair the store door, because the replaced locks only are insufficient. Graham (Cheadle) and his partner and lover Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are investigating a the shooting of an undercover cop. Graham is also taking care of his ailing mother, and has a brother who is career liability.The surprise and power of 'Crash' is in the story unfolding. This is intended not to give anything way. Haggis eloquently and poignantly reveals that all is not what it seemspointing to our own prejudgment. The beauty of 'Crash' is that we the audience gets to walk in 'another's shoes'. Sandra Bullock is amazing and compelling as the seemingly unsympathetic rich bigoted wife Jean. Her Jean has a realization: 'I am angry all the time and I don't know why.' The catharsis for her is that she is the reason she is so alone. Matt Dillon is electrifying as Officer Ryan, who is both an enforcer of stereotypes and a man capable of great courage and compassion. Don Cheadle is a commanding presence. His Graham is caught in a racially black and white world, where decisions are gray. Cheadle has this quiet strength of will and profound humanity as he makes things work with Ria (Esposito), his mother, and his life. No one gets out unscathed. No one is the villain. Everyone is humanthe great paradox. Shakespeare said of Man, 'the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?' 'Crash' depicts our individual prejudices, and also our innate nobility and capacity for compassion. Through 'Crash' Haggis seems to say that it comes down to choice. 'Crash' is an absolutely powerful movie that lives with you well beyond the screen.",10,1,6,9 February 2006
Spider-Man: Homecoming," The Hero is Way More Than Just the Suit
","After fearlessly saving Liz, played by smart pretty Laura Harrier, from the plunging elevator in Washington Monument as Spider-Man, 15 year- old Peter, played by Tom Holland, summons all his courage to tell Liz, 'I like you.' Peter then asks the girl of his dreams to the Homecoming dance, 'Do you want to go with me?' This is the distinct delightful charm of 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'. Director and Writer Jon Watts's 'Spider-Man' is visually stunning action as when Peter strains together the severed ferry boat in the Hudson. 'Homecoming' is clumsy and clunky at times, but it is all heart.Watts and the army of screenwriters, Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley, Christopher Ford, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers composed the narrative based on the Marvel Comic with varying outcomes. Tom Holland is the star who enrolls our compassion. As Spider-Man and his teenage persona Peter, Holland has a frenetic and gee whiz charmâ€”he captures the kid whom Peter Parker really is. Peter's friendship with geek buddy Ned, played by spirited Jacob Batalon, has a sweet and timeless air of youth and innocence. Fortunately, the story leverages the gravitas of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and Iron Man in the new role of Peter's mentor and father figure. Holland's quiet power emerges from this screen partnership and expands throughout. After Tony confronts Peter's recklessness, Peter tells him, 'I wanted to be like you.' Tony says, 'I wanted you to be better than me!' At its best 'Homecoming' is about seeing and allowing for the greatness in others. At times however, 'Spider-Man' stumbles over itself. Michael Keaton as the villain Vulture and Adrian Toomes is not compelling. Keaton's performance is magnetic. All Toomes is, is angry and bitter. No nuance of the character. He is about money and greed. So what? 'Homecoming' opens 8 years ago as Tony Stark and the Government void Toomes's lucrative construction contract to repair the demolished Avengers Headquarters following the vicious alien invasion. In the following years Toomes utilizes the stolen alien technology from the Avengers site to steal and market weapons of mass destruction. With this technology Toomes creates himself as the advanced weapon, the Vulture. We empathize with great villains in their exposed humanity. Unfortunately, as good as Keaton is, Toomes is a heartless jerk. In a departure from previous 'Spider-Man' movies Peter's guardian Aunt May is played by stunningly beautiful and funny Marisa Tomei. Previous incarnations of Aunt May were as a much older sage woman. Not someone who gets hit on by the server at their favorite Thai restaurant. In a touching scene Peter implores Ned not to tell Aunt May that he is Spider-Man, because 'she has suffered enough'. Watts clearly missed the opportunity to deepen the relationship with May, who believes and loves Peter. She is kind and soulful as she coaches Peter for his Homecoming date. Too bad much of Tomei's performance is the irony of her youthful attraction. In the story Peter returns from battle in 'Captain America: Civil War' with Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Tony gifts Peter with the Stark Industries high-tech Spider-Man suit. Peter believes that if he proves himself, he can become an Avenger. In the meantime, he'll be the hero as 'the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man'. Tony's assistant Happy, played by hilarious Jon Favreau, takes charge of Peter's personal growth. When not doing the 'Stark Fellowship' duties, Peter resumes high school life as member of the Academic Team and sparring with iconoclast Michelle, played by wonderful Zendaya, who perhaps is a little too annoyed with Peter. Holland's exuberance and understated power make him perhaps the best Spider-Man in a long while. His mercurial presence lightens up the screen on 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'. He captures the frailty, grace and courage of the hero. His Peter discovers that the hero within is way more than just the suit he wears. He finds his power as he believes in himself. That inspires in 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'.",9,33,61,9 July 2017
The Expendables," Stand for Something
","Sylvester Stallone's mercenary Barney Ross asks fellow 'Expendable' Tool (grizzled Mickey Rourke) why he is haunted by freedom fighter Sandra (beautiful Giselle Itie), daughter of the South American dictator. With incongruous gravity Rourke says, 'Because she stands for something' Tool says 'We stand for sh*t.', and they haven't stood for anything for a long time. Barney listens in silence to this wake up call. Director and Writer Stallone's 'The Expendables' is completely entertaining, and at times puzzling in its diverging context. Both Rourke and Stallone are compelling in this scene-- the story's emotional arc. Displaced all within the swirling firepower, exquisitely orchestrated beat downs from Jason Statham, Jet Li, and Randy Couture, and bloody body count. In one sense 'The Expendables' is accurately represented by rogue CIA operative gone despot Munroe (savory evil Eric Roberts), who calls it 'bad Shakespeare'.The tag is not a knock, instead more an ambitious or pretentious affect of the screenplay by Stallone and David Callaham. 'The Expendables' lead by Barney (Stallone) are a group of biker mercenaries—former Company operatives, who were the best. Barney meets with mysterious Church (Machiavellian Bruce Willis) and CIA 'contractor' Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Church will pay Barney $5 million to kill General Garza (David Zayas), military dictator of a South American island. Of course, the mission is not officially CIA sanctioned. Lee Christmas (cool and solid Jason Statham) inquires with Barney, what the real mission is, and whether the Expendables are being set up. Yin Yang (low key funny and strong Jet Li) only wants to know if he can get more money-- he has family issues.Barney and Lee, who suffers recent estrangement from girlfriend Lacey (gorgeous Charisma Capenter), both fly off to the island for mission recon. Surprisingly, their contact is Sandra (Itie), who turns out to be General Garza's daughter. Here the action is spectacular and the cinematography of Brazil is vibrant. Jason Statham is awesome precision as he dispatches of Garza's men with kicks and blades. The destruction of the island port during the escape is exaggerated and breathtaking. Stallone delivers the goods throughout 'The Expendables'.In the opening scenes during the daring rescue of hostages from Somalian Pirates, we learn the Expendables are deadly. Barney (Stallone) is as fast as light with a gun. Lee (Statham) is silent death with knives. Yin (Li) is the master martial artist. Demolitionist expert Toll Road is mix martial arts champion Randy Couture. Weapons specialist Hale Caesar is solid and funny Terry Crews. Dolph Lundgren plays the tormented expert sniper Gunner—he is an addict and liability to the team. Tool is the equivalent of Bond's 'Q' and the emotional anchor of the story. Then again, the amazing Rourke did the same in this summer's 'Iron Man 2'. In a great scene Rourke poignantly reminds us even in the midst of the high testosterone and broad narrative strokes of the costs of war, and losing one's very soul.Rourke, Stallone, and Statham make 'The Expendables' work. Rourke is a good foil for Stallone's battle weary Barney. Stallone looks totally shredded, displaying Tool's tattoo art. He is solid and acknowledges his age in this story. In a savage fight with Munroe's henchman Paine (merciless Steve Austin), he admittedly gets his ass kicked. Stallone wisely leaves the heavy lifting to the younger Jason Statham. Statham also looks amazing, and has a wry sensibility as Lee. On film he is a stunningly dramatic martial artist. In the most satisfying devastating fight scene he tells Lacey's boyfriend, who beat her, 'Your life-- I was thinking about taking it!' Fortunately, he is a merciful man of his word. Jet Li does not have much to do here. Although he has an electrifying fight scene with Lundgren's Gunner, who towers about a foot over Li. Li is explosive. Lundgren is up to the task being a former heavyweight kickboxing champion. All the fighting sequences in 'The Expendable' are executed with brutal precision. I was in awe watching Randy Couture slam 250 pound men to the ground so effortlessly.In the end, 'The Expendables' delivers on the action and then some, and Mickey Rourke infuses the right touch of gravitas. 'The Expendable' is so entertaining, and I would be up for seeing a sequel.",8,4,12,15 August 2010
Knocked Up," Knocked Up is Knock Out
","In an unexpectedly introspective scene in 'Knocked Up', Pete (Paul Rudd) with Ben (Seth Rogen) watch Pete's daughters play with soap bubbles. Pete says,' They (the girls) remind you that you will never be that happy again.' Later in a heartbreaking moment Pete's wife Debbie (Leslie Mann) cries to Pete, 'That is so mean! ' Not to give anything way, it is not an indiscretion, but to Debbie it may as well have been a crippling betrayal. Even with the hysterical sexual humor and clever four letter rifts, 'Knocked Up' has the striking background story of a marriage enduring and working out. Writer and Director Judd Apatow's 'Knocked Up' is raucous and smart R-rated fun that is amazingly sweet and sentimental. 'Knocked Up' is refreshingly entertaining, and a great movie. I guess this is not very surprising coming from Apatow, who also did 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin'.A week ago I read a curious review by Carina Chocano of the L.A. Times. She contended that a failing of 'Knocked Up' is that we never get to 'wonder if maybe she (Katherine Heigl's Alison) might have done a little better.' She makes a valid point. Katherine Heigl's Alison is drop dead gorgeous, smart, has a career, and she ends up having a costly one night stand with Seth Rogen's Ben. Charming as Rogen is, he is no Brad Pitteven if you are stone cold drunk. More on that later. Though a valid observation, 'Knocked Up' is merely a movie, and a comedy at that. Whether a slacker, apparent loser guy with a big heart would really end up with the smart and stunningly gorgeous woman like Alison would really happen, seems beside the point. After all, this is a movie. So Seth Rogen plays Ben, a smart, funny slacker dude, who along with his roommates is starting up a 'skin' website on the Internet. Yes, theirs is a noble ambition. Ben is basically an over grown adolescent living with a bunch of well intentioned, but lovable losers. On the other hand, Alison (Heigl) works as a production assistant for the 'E!' channel. She lives with her sister Debbie (Mann), husband Pete (Rudd), and their two daughters to save money. Alison lives in the guest-house and helps out with the kids when she can. Alison is brilliant and ambitious career woman. The producers at 'E!' promote Alison to on-camera interviewer. To celebrate Alison and Debbie have girls' night at a club. There Debbie meets Ben and his crew. Ben recovers from an out of body charming moment with Alison. When Debbie is called away on family emergency, Alison chooses to stay with Ben. They proceed to get drunk, but also seem to have a natural chemistry. Ben ends up back at Alison's guest-house. Ben even says to Alison, 'You are a lot prettier than I am' However, before the throes of passion, Ben does not 'snap on' his protection. Consequently, 8 weeks later Alison is pregnant. So aside from learning to be parents, Ben and Alison must get to know each other, as well as something about themselves.Here Apatow brilliantly contexts Debbie (Mann) and Pete's (Rudd) marriage. There is a lot of broadly leveled marital humor throughout, but the performances by Mann and Rudd are amazing and anchor the movie. Debbie lends insight on marriage and parenthood to Alison. Pete does the same with Ben. Debbie authentically anguishes over fears of being too old to be hot, as she comically lashes out at a night club doorman. When she feels betrayed by Pete, that is heart retching. Rudd is hilarious as he parties in Las Vegas with Ben. And he displays touching humility when Ben points out to him that Debbie loves him so much that she wants to spend all her time with him. 'Knocked Up' is amazing in that it is completely funny throughout in poking fun at the stupid and selfish things we do. However, it also balances this with an appreciation for what is best and noble in people. Seth Rogen is completely charming and hilarious. He inhabits Ben with a gentle and caring soul. You clearly root for slacker Ben, to grow up and be the man he so avoids being. Katherine Heigl ('Grey's Anatomy) is going to be a big star. Stunningly beautiful she is so bold and vulnerable in playing Alison, the together gal suddenly facing single parenthood and raging hormones. There is a hysterical rant where she screams to Ben, 'My vagina will never be the same' This serves as a reminder; 'Knocked Up' is not for kids. However, for adults 'Knocked Up' is hysterical comedy that is surprisingly sweet and poignant. Apatow's 'Knocked Up' is awesome.",10,1,5,10 June 2007
Megamind," 'Megamind' has Mega Laughs and Heart
","DreamWorks' animated 'Megamind' benefits ironically from Will Ferrell's hysterical voice rendering. Ferrell voices the slender bulbous headed blue complexioned super-villain Megamind. His usual goofy oafish persona is not a glaring distraction as the diminutive misunderstood leather clad evil genius. Ferrell is uncharacteristically restrained, and self aware as Megamind. At a story arc, his Megamind confesses, 'Bad guys don't save the day, and they don't get the girl' In the plot twist of the original story by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simmons, the super-villain must transform into the superhero. This is no surprise. What is surprising? 'Megamind' does so hilariously and poignantly.Director Tom McGrath seamlessly and simultaneously parodies the superhero genre and embraces it. Beleaguered Megamind apparently destroys his arch nemesis Metro Man (comically pompous Brad Pitt), anointed defender of Metro City. No one is more shocked than Megamind himself. Equally bewildered is intrepid reporter Roxanne Ritchie (spunky and composed Tina Fey): How could Metro Man die? Even if you haven't seen the movie trailer, you can kind of figure this one out. Anyway, Megamind institutes his evil reign of Metro City. However, he soon discovers there is little joy in evil, all alone. He realizes that eternal paradox: There is no evil, without good. Megamind was the Yin to Metro Man's Yang—the universal balance. Schoolcraft and Simmons eloquently pull a 'Kung Fu Panda'.Determined to restore the fun in evil, Megamind and his sidekick Minion (hysterically obtuse David Cross) embark to create a new hero. Leveraging Metro Man's DNA residue, the two select Hal (brilliantly geeky Jonah Hill) as their candidate. Hal creepily grips a torch for Roxanne. In horrendous miscalculation despite Megamind's Brando homage tutelage, Hal emerges as Titan-- ultimate super-villain. Unintentionally, Megamind places Roxanne in jeopardy. Meanwhile Megamind finds himself appreciating Roxanne. So Megamind must cowboy up: Reclaim his innate greatness, and become the hero he is destined to be. Flashback to the infant his parents secured in his spaceship bound for earth from their dying planet. With his father's words obscured Megamind screams, 'Destined for what? I didn't catch that last part!'The 3D in 'Megamind' is spectacular. 3D envisioning in animated features seem to fair best. The 3D is not really integral to the story. The effect of Metro City is a monolithic and futuristic version of Los Angeles. That context does work. What also work are narrative backdrops for both Megamind and Metro Man. Both share similar origins: Advanced alien parents of separate dying worlds send their sons to Earth as its saviors. Chaos literally collides as the baby, who becomes Metro Man, lands in the wealthy estate of Lord and Lady Scott. While the baby, who becomes Megamind, lands in a State Prison, and raised by its inmates. Their paths cross again as toddlers in a School for the Gifted. Megamind playing to his strong suit makes the life altering choice to be evil. Amazingly, we catch up with Megamind serving 8 consecutive life sentences, but from all accounts he has not harmed anyone. His sole punishment seems consequence of being the big loser in his battles with Metro Man.McGrath effectively enrolls Megamind's underdog empathy. His is a solitary and misrepresented existence—as in a failure to be. So when he accidentally impersonates gentle and kind Metro Man Museum curator Bernard (charming and clumsy Ben Stiller) and befriends the beautiful Roxanne (Fey), we pull for him. Megamind is more himself as Bernard, than his evil genius self. Roxanne is genuinely falling for Bernard as well. Here Ferrell displays a deceptive subtle charm. Fey is funny and vulnerable as the unflappable independent woman relinquishing her guard. Brad Pitt is hysterical in self effacing parody as Metro Man. The narrative twist involving his Metro Man completes the movie with his aloof and touching turn. 'Megamind' is predictable only in structure; otherwise it is abundant with surprise. 'Megamind' has big laughs and a big heart.",9,3,6,5 December 2010
Blades of Glory," Perfect Pair
","In 'Blades of Glory' Will Ferrell and Jon Heder boldly go where no men have gone before: the world of competitive pairs figure skating. Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck's 'Blades of Glory' on the surface does not appear to be a big budget movie, but it delivers the big laughs in a stupid funny movie that is just plain funny. 'Blades of Glory' is hysterical. No one does straight brazenly stupid like Will Ferrell. As figure skater Chazz Michael Michaels, whose tag is 'Sex on Ice', Ferrell takes no prisoners. Jon Heder as rival figure skater Jimmy MacElroy, is the perfect straight-man. Amazingly, Ferrell and Heder are true comedic partners. 'Blades of Glory' works, because Ferrell and Heder play it straight up. One does not try to out funny the other. Instead they play their roles in earnest, and let the screenplay by Jeff Cox and Craig Cox generate the laughs. This figure skating parody may lack some of the bite of the 'Talladega Nights' take on NASCAR. However, 'Blades of Glory' provides a breeze of authenticity with appearances by Scott Hamilton, Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, and Brian Boitano. Confessed sex addict Chazz (Ferrell) even makes an outrageous pass at Nancy Kerrigan.Ferrell and Heder play arch rival figure skaters Chazz Michael Michaels and Jimmy MacElroy. Chazz is the skating outlaw and sex symbol on ice. Jimmy is the distinctively sensitive orphan child prodigy. Following a ridiculous awards brawl after tying for Olympic Gold, Chazz and Jimmy are banned from Men's Singles competition for life. Three and a half years later, Jimmy's Coach (Craig T. Nelson) discovers a loop hole in the ban. The lifetime ban does not apply to pairs figure skating competition. Therefore, Chazz and Jimmy make history and the tabloids as the first ever male-male pairs team. Coach inspires his men that as a male-male pairs team they can risk moves that other mixed pairs can'tincluding his 'Iron Lotus' death spiral. Chazz and Jimmy challenge the reign of pairs champions Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), an eerie brother and sister duo. Innocent Jimmy is smitten by the Van Waldenberg's younger sister Katie (Jenna Fischer). Thus, the stage is set. Can Chazz and Jimmy overcome their egos and determine who the dude of the pair is? Can Coach inspire his men to reclaim their past greatness? And is there no limit to the ruthlessness of the Van Waldenbergs? Well, 'Blades of Glory' is predictable to its soul. However, it is also refreshingly funny. There are groin jokes, and there are more groin jokes.Most of the humor comes from perfect casting of the characters. Will Ferrell's Chazz is so shamelessly stupid and arrogant; one need only applaud and admire. Ferrell's gift is that he stays in character throughout, oblivious to how funny he is. He and Heder have great chemistry. They have a hilarious scene where Chazz describes the origin of his tattoos. Jon Heder is a surprise. He actually fleshes out the sensitive Jimmy as a charming innocent. His relationship with Katie (Jenna Fischer) is humorously sweet and awkward. Fischer is also great as Katie, an unwilling pawn of the Van Waldenbergs. Craig T. Nelson is awesome. He provides a surreal and ridiculous authority. The only weakness may be Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler). Though likely more an artifact of the story, Stranz and Fairchild are inept and evil without posing any real comedic threat. Arnett and Poehler are funny, but in a one note fashion.As ridiculous as the skating scenes are, they land with artistry and style. Gordon and Speck orchestrate the ice with skill. The sliding 'scissors' move by Chazz and Jimmy had me laughing so hard I couldn't breath. The training scenes with Chazz and Jimmy are hysterical. 'Blades of Glory' gets high marks for degrees of over the top, and certainly for delivering the big laughs.",9,1,2,1 April 2007
Underworld Awakening," Kate Beckinsale Rocks in Underworld: Awakening
","The stunning Kate Beckinsale is back in skin tight leather spandex and kicking ass in 'Underworld: Awakening'. Kate looks amazing, sleek, and incredibly fit as Vampire Death Dealer Selene. She was not in the last 'Underworld' movie which was an uninspired origins tale. In a shrouded conspiracy, Selene (Beckinsale) has been frozen in a cryogenic chamber for 12 years. When we saw her last: She had escaped with her love Michael, a true hybrid—both Vampire and Lycan, i.e. Werewolf. However, in this near future the humans now hunt down the Vampire and Lycan. Amazingly, Beckinsale as Selene has emerged as a feminist hero of sorts. Women in the audience cheered as resurrected Selene snaps off the elbow of her malevolent captor. Beckinsale is sexy, charismatic, and all vengeance in 'Underworld: Awakenings'. She does not take crap from anyone, and tears through a lot of bad men.Fortunately, Screenwriters Len Wiseman and John Hlavin shade the touching maternal instincts of hero Selene with convincing Beckinsale. Selene discovers a mysterious hybrid child Eve (innocent and powerful India Eisley). Selene is immersed in the swirling conflict of the renegade Vampire Covenant and the genetically enhanced Lycan threat. She mourns her beloved Michael. She confesses to Eve, 'My heart is not cold. It's broken.' Wiseman and Hlavin effectively create Selene a cause to fight for with all her might—I would say soul, but she is a Vampire. She finds allies in valiant warrior Vampire David (strong and compassionate Theo James) and unlikely human Sebastian (stalwart Michael Ealy). The real menacing threat is enigmatic Dr. Jacobs (slick Stephen Rea), whose passion for apparent clinical science conceals an intricate conspiracy as well.Directors Mans Marlin and Bjorn Stein broker a kinetic visual style and manic sense of action—making this the most fun 'Underworld'. They provide a sense of urgency sans a self-important tone. And the action is wild. Beckinsale uses lightning quick jujitsu moves on human and Lycan. She is so cool standing tall in flowing trench coat, firing off rounds of bullets at the bad guys. Beckinsale has become an accomplished action star holding her own. She has the spectacular battle scene taking on a ferocious Lycan with a blade.Wiseman and Hlavin construct an intriguing premise surrounding the messiah-like hybrid child, and the future of Vampire and Lycan. Unfortunately, they don't play this out to its logical conclusion. This is a little disappointing. The 'Underworld' movies have kept the mythology interesting in that they are like 'Romeo and Juliet', but with Vampires and Werewolves. Here milking for a sequel may not have been too smart; primarily, because we are all for Beckinsale's Selene—wanting to see her mend her broken heart. Granted the insane action and gore are adequate distraction. The conclusion seems rather abrupt, and more a commercial decision. So I guess I will look forward to seeing Beckinsale don the black leather again in the next 'Underworld'.",8,2,6,2 February 2012
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad, Boom!
","'Suicide Squad' is a great time at the movies. Director and Writer David Ayers's 'Suicide Squad' makes absolutely no sense. That really doesn't matter nor I would guess was it ever the intent. Will Smith is all movie star swag with deceptive nuance. Margot Robbie is brilliant 'oh snap' irony as psycho killer Harley Quinn. Nuance is not the 'Suicide Squad' strong suit. However, Smith's assassin Deadshot salvages the movie with his paternal gravity. Robbie is a revelation in her brazen self-awareness of Harley's curse —both comic and sad. The movie critics completely misjudged the overall appeal. In a striking battle sequence the charismatic Smith as Deadshot, stands upon a fiery car shooting with Zen-like precision at an army of carbon headed soldiers. Yeah, you have to see the movie. Contrast this with a quiet exchange between him and Robbie's Harley as she genuinely asks, 'You ever been in love?' He says, 'No. Never.' She knows that's bulls**t. Smith and Robbie refine a lot of Ayers's broad narrative strokes. Ayer sporadically inserts insight amidst the high decibel noise. He could have done more. He benefits from generating strong performances throughout, especially from Joel Kinnaman and Viola Davis. Having expendable criminals saving the day has been done before. 'Suicide Squad' triumphs in that we end up caring about the Suicide Squad, despite being the 'bad guys'. Viola Davis is at her ruthless best as CIA Director Amanda Waller, who proposes assembling the world's most powerful and deadly criminals as protectors in case heroes like Superman go rogue. They are called 'meta-humans'. On the upside, the Government has plausible deniability, and the Suicide Squad is expendable by design. Apparently, this reflects the aftermath of 'Superman vs. Batman'. Having capable Special Forces operatives alone like Rick Flag, played by strong and smart Joel Kinnaman, are insufficient for such a scenario. So it is up to Waller and Flag to recruit the Suicide Squad. Flag brings in guardian executioner Katana (tough Karen Fukuhara), the woman samurai grieving the death of her husband, wielding a magical sword. Fukuhara is good, but expressively handicapped by her mask. The Katana lapse illustrates that there are too many super criminals in 'Suicide Squad', and not enough back story. Members of the Suicide Squad have heinously killed many people, mostly innocent. So transforming them into heroes is daunting. We see the ripped Deadshot (Smith) punching a bag trying to survive in prison. His daughter is his only reason for taking on this mission. Harley Quinn (Robbie) is an uncontrollable killer, who was turned evil by Batman's nemesis The Joker (creepy charismatic Jared Leto). Quinn is The Joker's lover, and he is the source of her power. The side story has The Joker beholding to her and seeking to get her back. Leto is a harsher version of Heath Ledger's Joker. There is tattooed Diablo (Jay Hernandez), who controls fire. Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye- Agbaje) is a creature like his name, whose powers seem to be thrashing and eating people. There are more Squad members—way too many.Ironically, it turns out that the Suicide Squad must stop the Enchantress (lovely and fierce Cara Delevingne), who is archaeologist June Moore. On an excavation site, a powerful ancient deity inhabits Moore. With her god-like powers Enchantress seems omnipotent, and it seems nearly impossible for the Suicide Squad to win. But the odds matter little, much like the story. Once in motion we are enthralled by 'Matrix'-like gun battles, the slick martial arts sequences, and mind bending explosions. 'Suicide Squad' is visually stunning. Know what to expect with 'Suicide Squad'. Admire its unpretentiousness, and enjoy the wild ride. Smith and Robbie's star power and nuance make up for a lot. 'Suicide Squad' is a fun summer movie.",8,1,4,13 August 2016
Capote," Capote Down Cold
","Truman Capote revolutionized modern American literature with his non-fiction novel 'In Cold Blood.' 'In Cold Blood' told the story of the heinous murder of the Cutter family in Halcomb, Kansas. The book and its author seem to be a paradox as depicted in Director Bennett Miller's 'Capote' which follows the writing of 'In Cold Blood'. 'In Cold Blood' would be Capote's last completed novel before his death years later. Capote was defined by his powerful words which at times seem incongruous with the witty, flamboyant, alcoholic, openly gay author. As stunningly portrayed by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Capote is a peculiar talented man with great vision, and completely selfish. Dan Futterman's screenplay based on the book by Gerald Clarke is captivating and compelling as a character study of a tragic crime and tragic author.In 1959 Capote (Hoffman) tells 'The New Yorker' editor that he wants to go to Kansas to research the brutal murder of the Cutter family. He travels to Kansas with his partner Nelle Lee Harper (amazing Catherine Keener), author of the soon to be published 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' Nelle is Truman's 'pass' into the conventional world of the Midwest to conduct his research of the murders. Truman and Nelle befriend police chief Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) during their stay in Kansas. Eventually the murderers are apprehendedPerry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Richard Hickok (Mark Pellegrino). Truman is strangely attracted to Perry, who is apparently intelligent and artistic. Truman sees him as a spiritual brother, burdened by a similarly painful past. Smith and Hickok are convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death by hanging. In the meantime, Truman rejoins his lover Jack (strong Bruce Greenwood) in Spain to begin the arduous process of writing 'In Cold Blood'. However, Truman desperately needs a completed Third Acta confession from Perry. Also the longer Perry and Hickok remain alive, the further the book release delays. Hoffman is compelling in drawing our compassion for Capote as this sad man who is alien anywhere outside of New York City, deceiving himself of his own self interests. In a great scene near the end when Truman cries that he tried everything to save Perry, Nelle (Keener) reminds him, 'But the truth is; you didn't want to.''Capote' is defined by its compelling performances. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is awesome as Capote. He will probably win an Oscar for his performance. Hoffman nails the Capote voice, and is completely authentic in his portrayal. His is not mimicry. He balances tragic and pathetic. Hoffman inhabits Capote as the lone outsider, who is only powerful when he is writing or creating worlds in his mind. Hoffman also charms as Truman with a biting sense of humor. Truman boasts that he has 94% retention of conversations and he knows this 'because I tested myself.' Catherine Keener is amazing as Nelle Harper. She commands a natural intelligence, strength, and compassion. Jack tells Truman that Nelle is 'even more man than' he is. She and Hoffman have great chemistry. As Nelle she provides a touching relationship for Truman which humanizes him, and punctuates Truman's isolation. The touching exchange between the two when she leaves Spain is subtle and heart felt. Director Miller's 'Capote' captures Truman Capote at the peak of his talent and prowess, before his gradual and tragic decline with drugs and alcohol. What stays with you is that Capote was a gifted writer who was most alive and powerful through his words, but his own voice reflected a sad man, who people never really truly got.",10,1,1,4 March 2006
Ocean's Thirteen," Glorious Fluff
","In a scene from 'Ocean's Thirteen' Brad Pitt's Rusty Ryan asks George Clooney's teary eyed Danny Ocean, 'Are you watching Oprah?' A few moments later Pitt's eyes well as both watch 'Oprah' and he says, 'So they are really going to build her a house' Clooney and Pitt are hysterical and making fun of their classic leading men personas. They are clearly having fun doing so. Steven Soderbergh's 'Ocean's Thirteen' is not just fluff; it is glorious fluff. This comical revenge tale by Brian Koppelman and David Levien is smart, funny and basically an excuse for a bunch of very talented actors to hang out and have fun. You have Academy Award Winners or Nominees Clooney, Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Al Pacino all together in one movie, who all enjoy working with each other. Soderbergh's 'Ocean's Thirteen' is not ground breaking movie making; however, it is breezy cool at its best.In 'Ocean's Thirteen' Willie Banks (Al Pacino) betrays Reuben (Elliot Gould) in a hotel casino deal that nearly costs Reuben his life. Consequently, Danny, Rusty, Linus (Matt Damon) and the rest of the crew come to Rueben's rescue. Danny and Rusty also enlist the expertise of security strategist Roman (Eddie Izzard) to break the casino of the Banks Hotel on the Las Vegas strip. The Banks Hotel caters to the 'whales'extreme high rollers. However, Roman informs Danny and Rusty that the Banks Casino employs the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence system called 'Greco'named after its inventor Greco Montgomery (Julian Sand). The system is virtually fool proof. When part of their plan falters Danny is forced into an alliance with former rival Terry Benedict (ruthless Andy Garcia). At the same time there is a hilarious subplot involving a worker revolt in a dice manufacturing plant in Mexicoyou really have to see the movie to appreciate this.There is nothing really distinctive about 'Ocean's Thirteen' storyit is well paced and executed. The dialog is crisp, clever, and funny. Al Pacino does what he was hired to do which is gnaw on the scenery. He is masterful. Matt Damon makes a hilarious comic turn as Linus disguises himself as Lenny Pepperidge, the interpreter of a Chinese high roller. Don Cheadle is solid as Basher, doubling as expert engineer and motorcycle daredevil. George Clooney is smart, charming, and cool as Danny Ocean. Brad Pitt is at his breezy best, and again demonstrates his gift as a natural straight manalbeit to Clooney's Ocean. 'Ocean's Thirteen' is basically a guys' movieliterally. One saving grace is the stunning and strong Ellen Barkin as Banks' right hand Abigail Sponder.Steven Sonderbergh hinted that this maybe the last 'Ocean's'. With 'Ocean's Thirteen' being this much fun to watch, and apparently to make; he should keep on going. All involved are great and having a great time.",9,1,4,17 June 2007
Doctor Strange," The Infinite Possibility
","In 'Doctor Strange' The Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton implores Stephen Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who suffers to save his very soul, 'Surrender, Stephen.' Stephen must surrender to not knowing anything. Only then, can he begin to reclaim his power and his life. This is an awesome surprise. Director Scott Derrickson's 'Doctor Strange' is about transformation in the guise of an action movie, done with a sense of humor. Cumberbatch's Strange invents himself when the old definition of himself no longer works, and in fact is killing him. This invention is perhaps, the most noble of human pursuits. Capturing the poignancy with a sense of humor and 'Beyonce'' jokes possesses an enlightened sensibility. 'Doctor Strange' aspires for the heavens and never takes itself too seriously. Acknowledge Derrickson, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill for writing the brilliant story based on the comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Signatures of the 1960's comic book materialize in the mind-bending psychedelic visuals. The 'Doctor Strange' comics debuted during the time of Timothy Leary and the consciousness expansion movement. This 'Doctor Strange' is visually masterful. With the folding metropolis visuals, and M.C. Escher generated mazes, Derrickson one ups Christopher Nolan's 'Inception'. His story is homage to the hero origin of Nolan's 'Batman Begins'. The exquisite martial arts sequences remind of the grace of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and the fluidity of 'The Matrix'. 'Doctor Strange' is still uniquely its own about powerful sorcerers defending the world from mystical threats on infinite planes of existence. Here this is done sans drugs, happily. Cumberbatch and Swinton have profound magic together. Marvel is astounding in choosing amazing actors, who transcend the medium with grace and humanity. Even with spectacular showcase battles of good and evil, the best scene occurs in the New York emergency room with Strange and The Ancient One. The Ancient One touchingly tells Strange what she sees beyond his arrogance and fear. I was in tears with the resolve. Noble ideas and powerful actors truly make 'Doctor Strange' special. Much has been discussed about casting Swinton as The Ancient One, originally written as an Asian character. I am Japanese American, aware of the sensitivity of the issue. I think Swinton is the best actor cast, and she delivers the message of nobility in all of us.'Doctor Strange' has somewhat of a trite beginning. Trite in the sense that we see the possibility of the world class jerk becoming the selfless hero. Dr. Stephen Strange is the brilliant egotistical neurosurgeon caught up in his own celebrity. He is handsome, rich, and virtually immortal. His arrogance alienated his true love Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), a courageous ER doctor. McAdams is amazing; her Christine allows us to see the good man in Strange beneath it all. Unfortunately, she isn't leveraged more. She has a heartbreaking scene with Strange, whose self pity destroys all. Strange suffers a devastating car accident resulting in irreparable nerve damage to his hands. His career is over. His definition of himself is no longer. Having exhausted all surgical and rehabilitation avenues, Strange seeks out Jonathan Pangborn (solid Benjamin Bratt). Pangborn was a paraplegic, who miraculously cured himself. He instructs Strange to learn from The Ancient One in Kamar-Taj in Nepal. Strange travels to Kathmandu. He befriends Mordo (charismatic and calm Chiwetel Ejiofor), a powerful sorcerer warrior. He accompanies Stephen to The Ancient One, who is Sorcerer Supreme—protector of our realm from dimensional evil. The Ancient One sees possibility in Stephen, but his biggest obstacle is himself. The Ancient One's best disciple Kaecilius (dangerous Mads Mikkelsen) has gone rogue, murdering his own and stealing a page from the magic book of Elders. The spells empower him to control time and serve the omnipotent Dormammu. Kaecilius is ruthless; however, he is a compelling villain in that his motives are laced with worthy intentions. The Ancient One may have also compromised herself in the battle of good and evil. 'Doctor Strange' is about the Yin and Yang of the universes. Strange accepts the greater good and the consequences. His dear friend and protector Mordo can only see the dark and light. Balance lies in compassion and acceptance. There is no Yin and Yang in the extremes which is prophetic.'Doctor Strange' is a great movie. Michio Kaku said that there may be infinite number of universes, much like the Multiverse of 'Doctor Strange'. There is both wonder and comfort in this. The Ancient One saw infinite possibility in Stephen Strange. Perhaps 'Doctor Strange' asks us see the infinite possibility within ourselves.",10,3,7,6 November 2016
Interstellar," 'Interstellar' transcends
","Matthew McConaughey's widower Cooper consoles his 10 year-old daughter Murph played by wonderful Mackenzie Foy, 'Parents end up becoming the ghosts of their children's future.' Coop, now a corn crop farmer was NASA's best pilot, is embarking on a mission to find a new world for his daughter and her generation. Cooper has no idea if he returns, when that would be-- perhaps decades? Set in the near future in Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' the Earth is dying—sand storms and worldwide blight ravage, and humanity must look to the stars for another home. Nolan captivates with stunning visual imagery like a 500 foot tidal wave on distant planet, but it is his story along with Jonathan Nolan about the love of a father for his daughter that has profound gravity. Anne Hathaway's brilliant scientist Brand echoes this, 'Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.' Matthew McConaughey is amazing in his down home heroism and authentic compassion. His soothing gravitas is the stabilizing force as 'Interstellar' goes n- dimensional in Nolan's narrative toward the end. 'Interstellar' is the awesome epic that works best in its unassuming moments. 'Interstellar' clocks in at just under 3 hours. The first hour is engrossing earthbound storytelling. Nolan creates the personal mythology for his transformational allegory. In a powerful scene Cooper silences Murph's righteous teachers, telling them of his wife's fate. Cooper along with his rock solid Dad Donald (great John Lithgow) is raising Murph and his son Tom (spirited Timothee Chalamet). They struggle on the farm to survive like everyone else. Emerging genius Murph believes that their house is haunted by ghosts. Murph and Coop's epiphany leads them to the encounter with Dr. Brand (Hathaway) and her father Professor Brand (Michael Caine). Professor Brand trained Coop and asks him to lead the mission to find another world to rescue all of mankind. There is a wormhole, a bend in space connecting over vast distances, near Saturn's moon Titan. Cooper and Brand's daughter (Hathaway) must find a suitable new world, and somehow return home. In the meantime Prof. Brand must solve the equations that allow transport of people from Earth. Once in space 'Interstellar' embraces the wondrous unknown, and is impeded by the predictable. The conspiracy threads become a distraction. Jessica Chastain as the grown up Murph is the brilliant astrophysicist helping Brand (Caine) solve the relativity paradox. Chastain's Murph's achievements are the aftermath of her anger for her father leaving her. Chastain is powerful. McConaughey mesmerizes as he watches videos of his children grown and having their lives—without him. Famed Physicist Kip Thorne oversaw the science of 'Interstellar' for Christopher Nolan. We have amazing insights about Black Holes and special relativity. The visuals are stunning. However, the story gets really confusing as we literally go beyond 3 dimensions, as the plot holes emerge and the conspiracy narrative distracts. Matt Damon appears as Dr. Mann and is commanding, but seems more of a plot device. Fortunately, Nolan returns to the human elements where 'Interstellar' thrives with McConaughey, Chastain, and Hathaway. Chastain is awesome. She gives a touching poignancy to bond with Cooper beyond time and space. Hathaway shines, but seems under leveraged. McConaughey is at his best; he is the power within 'Interstellar'. We pull for him for his love for Murph, and he gave his word in a world of no possibility. This is where 'Interstellar' transcends.",9,0,6,27 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The Journey Comes to an End in 'The Rise of Skywalker'
","In 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' Daisy Ridley's Hero Rey tearfully embraces General Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher. She says, 'Rey, never be afraid of who you are.' Her Master's wisdom in the Way of the Jedi, the noble warriors from long ago, in a galaxy far, far away.J. J. Abrams returns directing 'The Rise of Skywalker', signifying the end of this 'Star Wars' trilogy, and resolving our 42 year journey together in the mystical ways of the Force. 'Never be afraid of who you are...' Ironically, Director J. J. stumbles a bit in the first third of the movie defining what 'The Rise of Skywalker' wants to be in its rapidly kluged narrative by J. J. and Chris Terrio.Angry Kylo Ren of the evil First Order, played with surprising power by Adam Driver, discovers the Wayfarer device which leads to the planet Exegol. There, he seeks to take the life of the Emperor Palpatine, played by palpably evil Ian McDiarmid. But wait: Isn't the Emperor dead? Yeah, he too like Yoda is strong with the Force, albeit the Dark Side.Meanwhile, Rey rigorously trains with Leia to become a Jedi. From the previous movies, Rey is some kind of Force Savant: She dismantled powerful Kylo Ren without any formal Jedi training. Kylo's human persona Ben is the son of Leia and Han Solo. Succumbing to the Dark Side, Kylo murdered his own Father, Han. Rey witnessed the heinous act. Mysteriously, Rey and Kylo are bound together by the Force.So is Rey destined for the Dark or Light Side of the Force? Is she the balance of the Dark and the Light? Rey discovers that her previous Master Luke Skywalker, played by aged earnest Mark Hamill, was also searching for Exegol. So Rey takes up her Master's cause with the help of her Republic Rebel friends.Amidst the rushed narrative start and well-meaning nostalgia, Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver embody compelling humanity, making 'The Rise of Skywalker' something special. This time around Kylo is compassionately fleshed out, more 'grown up'. Adam is powerful in his underplay. His Kylo surrenders to personal damnation for his horrific acts. Yet, his path of redemption resides in Rey, knowing that he can never be truly forgiven. Adam astounds as Kylo discovers his possible strength within.'The Rise of Skywalker' is the classic Hero's journey. Daisy authentically commands as Rey unconceals who she is, and who she can become. Daisy's gentle green eyes tell the story, when asked what she fears. She says, 'Myself.' Rey is not brave, because she possesses the great powers of the Force, like when she breathtaking takes on Kylo Ren's speeding ship, leaping in the air with her lightsaber.Her Rey is brave, because she is able to be with her fear. Daisy convinces us that the Hero's power lies in compassion, in her kindness to suffering Kylo. And yes, there's reason for Rey great prowess. Yet, Daisy makes us pull for Rey to find her measure of peace.Aside from Rey and Kylo, many of the characters and supporting narratives occur as superfluous. John Boyega and Oscar Issac return as former Storm Trooper Fin and Rebel pilot Poe as do others. John, Oscar and even Billy Dee Williams are good in their roles. Yet, they seem unnecessary. Honestly, I never got why Finn is meaningful in this trilogy. Poe is occurs as a Han Solo wannabe.That being said, endure the rapid paced forced narrative of Act I. Have patience in the splintered aspects of Act II. Act III of 'The Rise of Skywalker' is worth the wait. The battles are visual spectacles in cinematic catharsis. Much like all the amazing special effects throughout the movie. Although, Daisy and Adam truly mesmerize, because they make us care.I never thought of the Force as the Dark or Light distinction. I think of the Force in terms of Yin and Yang. There is no all Good. No all Evil. The Force like life is about the balance of Dark and Light. 'The Rise of Skywalker' is about choice: Use one's powers for good, not evil. Just saying. That makes 'The Rise of Skywalker' so special. It eloquently concludes our 42 year 'Star Wars' journey. Amen.",9,7,15,23 December 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," Everybody wants to be us...
","I finally saw 'The Devil Wears Prada'. I kept bumping into it on HBO over the weekend, and what I saw looked good. So I finally just bought the DVD. 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a great movie, and now among my all time favorites. When the movie came out last year, I had intended to see it, but never did. Although, I had read stellar reviews and heard great things, I could not find a comedy set in the high fashion world at all compelling. I was utterly wrong. It is the context more than the content that makes 'The Devil Wears Prada' both hysterical and touchingly bitter sweet. Aline Brosh McKenna's screenplay based on Lauren Weisberger's novel is crisply written with deadly wit and style. The 'Devil' is Miranda Priestly, Editor-in-Chief of fictional 'Runway' magazine. Priestly is a thinly veiled characterization of Vogue Magazine's Editor-in-Chief. Commanded by Meryl Streep, Miranda is anything but caricature. As Miranda, Streep gives her most striking performance. She is simply awesome, and so deserving of her Oscar nomination in February. I love Anne Hathaway as Andy, Miranda's unlikely second assistant and eventual protégé. Hathaway of 'The Princess Diaries' proves more than a younger Julia Robertsshe is a young Audrey Hepburn. First of all, Hathaway is classically beautiful, and has a smile that melts a room. She displays her natural smarts in her joyful presence. She has a deft light comic touch. She also has the star power to hold her own with Streep. Theirs is an amazing screen partnership. What touched me about 'The Devil' is that it is a razor sharp comedy masking a touching rites of passage tale. The movie works because the context provided by Director David Frankel generates masterful performances by Streep, Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Brunt.Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, a young Northwestern University graduate with a journalism degree, who needs a job desperately. Through some human resources glitch Andy interviews for a second assistant position for Miranda Priestly at 'Runway'. Fashion retarded Andy, does not even know who Miranda is, much less that she should fear for her life. Miranda takes a chance and hires Andy given that she is so unlike her previous girlsbeing that Andy is the 'smart fat girl'. Be mindful that 'fat' is in comparison to the couture starved. Miranda is merciless. I immediately liked Miranda, probably displaying my own twisted nature. However, I saw that Miranda was training Andy to be strong and survive in the shark infested world of high fashion. Hers in a strange way is ruthless compassion. This undercurrent resonates throughout. After having a horrific day, Andy fishes for sympathy from Nigel (great Stanley Tucci), Miranda's ace Art Director, who says, ' You're whining.' Knock it off. Andy endures unrelenting ordeal including a hilarious 'Harry Potter' manuscript request. However, Andy cowboys up, and begins to gravitate to Miranda. Andy's relations including her boyfriend Nate (charming Adrian Grenier) begin to view Andy as a sell out. Andy gives her life to her job, no longer mocks the vapid nature of the fashion industry. I think it is director Frankel and screenwriter McKenna's point that Andy acknowledges the greatness in Miranda, and begins to aspire to that. However, the catch is that this at least for Miranda comes at a costsacrifice of her own humanity.In a poignant limo ride scene Miranda says to Andy, 'I see a great deal of myself in you' Andy says, 'I couldn't do something like that.' Miranda points out, 'You already did' She then punctuates by saying, 'Everybody wants to be us.' Here Streep is killer, because it is not about vanity. It is fact, according to Miranda. In perhaps her most edgy and powerful performance Streep as Miranda is completely dominating and forceful, yet never raising her voice. She grants Miranda moments of frailty that beautifully capture what Miranda has forfeited on her rise to power. Streep can say more with a dispassionate gaze than entire pages of dialog. I think Miranda sees herself, and what she has lost in Andy. Here Hathaway brilliantly captures the embers of idealism and heart. Hathaway has radiant spirit, and her eyes speak eloquently for her. Everything about her performance is natural with an authentic charm. The rest of the cast is amazing. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as the prissy and wise Nigel. Emily Blunt masterfully balances the vulnerability and bitchiness of first assistant Emily.It is mostly the unsaid that captivates and enthralls 'The Devil Wears Prada'. Watching Streep as Miranda as she introspectively gazes, and lets out a subtle smile reminded me why I love movies. When you have the right director, writers, and actors all coming together it is like magic. 'The Devil Wears Prada' is simply wonderful and amazing.",10,1,4,4 August 2007
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Episode II, not strong with The Force
","George Lucas's 'Star Wars: Episode II-- Attack of the Clones' is pretty good, and a theatrical puzzle-- not necessarily in a good way. Episode II has a few things going for it: a talented cast including Ewan McGregor and Samuel L. Jackson, is a gorgeous movie to look at, and has a whole mythology which has become part of popular culture. Early on there is breath-taking 'sky diving' scene in an aerial city with Jedi Padwan, Anikan Skywalker (Hayden Christensen), and his mentor, a now older Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). This is well done-- great pace, action, full of life. The movie, however soon bogs down. George Lucas and Jonathan Hales have constructed a very wordy script that is full of content about the trade wars, the unrest in the Republic, the conspiracy against the Jedi, and a lame love story between Anikan (Christensen) and Padme (Natalie Portman). There is really no context. If the context of Episode II is to illicit pathos for Anikan's journey down the Dark Side of the Force, it fails or is a half-hearted attempt. Rather Episode II shies away from the dark nature of the legacy. There in may lie the problem-- we all know how the story will end. There is a great scene where Anikan attacks out of anger (even though justified), and later vows that he will be all powerful, because he wasn't strong enough. Following this he whines to Padme (Natalie Portman). What is going on? This does not work for the man who will eventually become the evil and merciless, Darth Vader. Hayden Christensen is a good actor and charismatic, but his lines and the part of Anikan were so inconsistent. The dialog in Episode II is horrible throughout. Anikan really comes off as some whiny punk kid, rather than someone threatening and on the verge of malevolence. After all Anikan will become Darth Vader. Once again this is not a problem with the actor, but the story. The love story between Anikan and Padme is like 'Naboo 90210'. It is a given that they will be together. Obi-wan and Anikan are the Jedi assigned by the Republic to protect now Naboo Senator Padme Amidala after a failed assassination attempt on the senator. 10 years have past since they were together in Episode I. Anikan soon falls in love with Padme which is not allowed for a Jedi. Ewan McGregor is good as the now mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi. He gives a new maturity and gravity to the character. Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu is kind of the 'Shaft Jedi'. He kicks some butt. There are some great action scenes in Episode II, and there could have been more. The completely CGI Yoda gets to lay the smack-down at the end, as only the Jedi Master can. This is awesome, and almost saves the movie. Almost.I saw Episode II at a midnight showing on opening day with some dear friends-- so I am a fan. I will see it again. And I did wait a while before writing a comment. For me, although the movie looks great and has some awesome things in it, as a whole it lacks a soul. It seems like Lucas did not have the courage to give it a dark one, while providing the underlying context of Hope that we are familiar with in the stories of Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia.",7,2,3,13 June 2002
Corpse Bride," 'Til Death...
","Tim Burton's 'Corpse Bride' is deceivingly titled. Though its lead character is in fact dead, 'Corpse Bride' is inspired dark comedy and an unexpected touching love story. 'Corpse Bride' is traditional stop action animationa very time consuming process. A lot of time was also invested in the movie's storytelling. 'Corpse Bride' is a macabre fairy tale. Director Tim Burton is either hit or miss for me. Burton as usual is absurd and eccentric, but here he also follows a conventional fairy tale in spirit. This is largely due to the screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson. Their crafted tale is funny, clever, and also in love with its characters. Burton's 'Corpse Bride' is all hit. An almost unrecognizable Johnny Depp voices Victor Van Dort the young man who inadvertently 'marries' the Corpse Bride (voiced by the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter). Being that they are literally from different worldsone being that of the livingtheir future is cursed, so to speak. Their believable love story ultimately makes 'Corpse Bride' this wildly funny dark fairy tale about love and selflessness. Very cool stuff.Victor (Depp) is victim of an arranged marriage to Victoria Everglot (the very charming and strong Emily Watson) of the noble, but bankrupt Everglot family. The Van Dorts are the nouveau rich, in search of title. Hence this marriage fulfills title and wealth. Win. Win. You would think. During the rehearsal a suspicious relative Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) arrives a day early. Even his name is unsavory. Although Victor accidentally finds his soul mate in Victoria, he can not bring himself to follow through with the rehearsal. He flees to the forest. There he professes his vows to his true love, and the Corpse Bride (Bonham Carter) accepts. They leave for the world of the deadthe catch being that Victor still has a heart beat. Victor's stay is both hysterical and just plain weird.'Corpse Bride' does telegraph a plot point prematurely, but overall the story has a charming and touching twist. Credit its amazing voice actor talents. Johnny Depp gives Victor an innocence and strength of character that is never frivolous. Emily Watson threads the fine line as the 'other woman'. She gives Victoria great compassion and heart. This is really Helena Bonham Carter's showcase. As she voices the Corpse Bride she is initially unaffected, not realizing her fate. Then there is a visceral sadness when she comes to terms that she must go without love. She poignantly says, 'My dreams were taken from me.' So does she now take this away from someone she now loves? This really makes 'Corpse Bride' a funny, inspired, and special movie. This is Tim Burton's best work. See 'Corpse Bride'.",9,8,11,2 October 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," Behind the Closet
","Pixar and Disney's 'Monsters, Inc.' is great fun for all.  It was a suprisingly good movie, with a interesting and often touching story by Jill Culton, director Peter Docter, and others.  To their credit along with Peter Docter's direction, the story telling is coherent and entertaining throughout.  John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi are just terrific in their voice roles.  The cutting edge computer animation is awesome.  The idea that monsters scare children at night, to collect power for Monsters, Inc. to power the Monster city is novel.  But kids are getting harder to scare, jaded.  So times are tough for Monsters, Inc.  Sometime  is spent setting up and introducing Monster, Sulley (Goodman), and his bud, Mike (Crystal).  Sulley is a star scarer and his rival is the nasty Randall (Buscemi).  The movie really moves once Boo (a cute Mary Gibbs) enters Monsters, Inc. through her bedroom closet.  Sulley and Mike must get Boo back home.  The relationship between Sulley and Boo works.  MI is sentimental, and has a cute message about  courage and fear.  It does all this in 90 minutes.  Monsters, Inc. is an enjoyable package.",9,0,1,12 November 2001
21 Jump Street," Hysterical '21 Jump Street'
","Evading gnarly biker drug dealers, undercover cops Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill hide in a Drivers Ed car. Tatum as Jenko tells Hill as Schmidt to pretend like he is giving him oral sex. Hill asks, 'Why me?' Tatum screams, 'You're the one in the f***ing Peter Pan costume!' '21 Jump Street' is hysterical! It has got to be the funniest movie of the year.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are awesome together and elevate Bromance to another level. They have a distinct goofy and sweet bond. Jonah Hill also wrote the story with screenwriter Michael Bacall based on the beloved 90's TV series which distinguished Johnny Depp. Depp also has an outrageous cameo as Hanson. Along with Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller ('Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs') this 'Jump Street' is juggernaut parody with an amazingly authentic high school culture vibe. '21 Jump Street' is hilarious and arrestingly cool.Hill and Bacall brilliantly take humorous shots at everyone blurring all lines. On the first day of school undercover, Jenko (Tatum) punches an African American teen; who he thinks gets in his face, turns out the kid is gay. Jenko says he didn't know he was gay. The kids verbally attack him for punching a gay kid. Deadpan Schmidt (Hill) says, 'So in a weird way, he is homophobic if he didn't hit him?' The logic escapes me, but the moment is classic. After getting their undercover assignment at abandoned street church, Schmidt prays, 'Hey Korean Jesus' There is actually a Korean Jesus on the cross. Jenko cracks up at Schmidt from behind.Tatum and Hill are deadpan genius. With Jonah Hill you kind of expect this. Channing Tatum is brilliantly funny. Tatum is undercover with a bunch of science geeks, one kid asks, 'So you were held back (2 years)?' He replies, 'So you were held forward (2 years)?' Will Ferrell would be proud. Obviously, '21 Jump Street' leverages the polarized personas. Tatum is the ripped handsome action guy playing the stupid jock. Hill, who slimmed down, is the vulnerable nerd, who wants to be cool. Both play in position. After being mortal enemies in high school they reunite 7 years later at the Police Academy. Jenko says, 'Hey not so Slim Shady, what's up?' Schmidt aces all the written exams. The physical training is cake for Jenko. They wisely form a partnership. Here Lord and Miller believably transform cultural opposites into best buds—the underlying sweetness of '21 Jump Street'. The humor always pushes the envelope, but they are never ever mean spirited. And there are a lot of penis jokes— most of them hilarious.Jenko and Schmidt graduate. However, their 'lifetime of being bad asses' takes an unfortunate turn. They are assigned as bike cops on park patrol. After a botched arrest and hilarious Miranda rights screw up, the duo are assigned to 21 Jump Street. Director of the program Captain Dickson, played with funny angry gusto by Ice Cube, informs everyone, 'You are here because you are Justin Beiber, Miley Cyrus looking mother f***ers!' Dickson wants Schmidt and Jenko to go undercover at their old high school and find the supplier of a particularly deadly designer drug. They watch YouTube videos of the stages of intoxication. While undercover they live with Schmidt's proud parents (funny Cardine Aaron and Joe Chrest). Pointing out an embarrassing kid glamor photo, Jenko says, 'You look like a young Jay Leno.' High school has changed from 2005. The cool kids are the preppy environmentally conscious teens lead by Eric (slick charming Eric Franco). Not memorizing their student identities Schmidt ends up on the track team and drama class, while Jenko goes to class with science nerds in AP Chemistry. So while Jenko learns about covalent bonds, Schmidt meets popular Molly (ironic and perky Brie Larson). Schmidt may have a shot at redemption for his high school romantic crash and burn. Rob Riggles is ridiculously funny as gym teacher Mr. Walters. He has a gut busting scene with the boys when they are as high as a kite.Surprisingly, '21 Jump Street' poignantly gets redemption and lifetime friendship. Jenko learns that he can be smart, and schools his geek brothers in being cool. There is an awesome montage with doves. The not so inside joke works: Tatum and Hill don't look at all like high school kids. After Jenko beats the crap out of bullies at their house party with his slick mixed martial arts skills, he stares in shock at Schmidt. Schmidt says, 'When did I get stabbed? That's awesome!' Tatum and Hill have an endearing chemistry: they are funny together and you get that they really pull for each other. They redefine comedic Bromance in '21 Jump Street'. I am absolutely waiting for 'Jump Street 2'. In the meantime, see '21 Jump Street'.",10,2,6,19 March 2012
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne Returns Strong
","Matt Damon as Jason Bourne comes home to exact revenge in Paul Greengrass's 'The Bourne Ultimatum', and it is well worth the wait. Greengrass and screenwriter Tony Gilroy return in this conclusion based on Robert Ludlum's 'Bourne' trilogy. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is a smart intense action packed thrill ride. Matt Damon is powerful as Jason Bourne, the government assassin desperately in search of his past and those who created him. Bourne says, ' and this is where it ends.' Bourne (Damon) escapes termination in Russia, and recalls vestiges of his origin. He tracks down British reporter Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), who has written about Bourne and the training program he was a part, to determine who is the source of this information.This soon leads to a clash with Black Ops director Noah Vosen (the great David Stratharin), who enlists CIA Operations Lead Pamela Landy (smart and sexy Joan Allen) to hunt down Bourne. All is not what it seems; Noah is somehow protecting Director Ezra Kramer (strong Scott Glenn). Noah leads a successor to the Treadstone program that created Jason Bourne (Damon). Pam pleads to Noah that Bourne must be taken alive to resolve this intelligence breach. Ignoring Pam, Noah orders Bourne be killed on sightactivating assassins to kill him. Bourne finds an unlikely ally in Nicky Parson (Julia Stiles, also in the previous movies), who may have had a past relationship with Jason which he does not remember.'The Bourne Ultimatum' has one the best fight scenes, ever. The fight with Jason and Desh (Joey Ansah) is brutally electrifying. Renowned stunt choreographer Jeff Imada said that he used kali in the scene. There are also elements of jeet kune do and aikidoand others I don't know. The fight is realistic and exquisitely executed. Ansah is an accomplished martial artist. Damon, who is in great shape, looks amazing in this knock down fight to the death. Aside from the appreciation of the great skill, this is a signature of the story. Bourne is old school. Desh represents the next generation of assassin: young, strong, and merciless. Desh accepts his mission to kill Bourne without question. Bourne on the other hand, is haunted by his past. At one point he confesses to Nicky (Stiles), 'I see all the faces of everyone I killed' He also accepts that he can never be forgiven for what he has done. This declaration in a sense makes Bourne honorable in this cloak and dagger world.I agree with Richard Roeper that Matt Damon gives an award worthy performance as Jason Bourne, but that is also unlikely given this is an action movie. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is a great action movie, largely due to Damon's performance. Damon is a powerful and physical presence. He eloquently balances the impeccable action scenes with the quiet introspective moments. Joan Allen is great as Pamela Landy. She commands a natural authority and respect, at the same time hinting at a weariness of the cost of freedom in the intelligence war on terror. Allen always brings an acute intelligence and strength that I find so attractive. David Stratharin is masterful in capping Noah's capabilityjust shy of Bourne's. His Noah is the obvious villain of Bourne maintained more as an undercurrent. Stratharin is amazing. Julia Stiles is smart and tough as Nicky; however, she isn't given much noteworthy to do. Here she may just be a pawn of the story.Paul Greengrass ('United 93') elevates the action movie to another level in 'Ultimatum'. Greengrass blitzes through the story across different countries, eventually concluding the States. His narrative style is focused and coherent throughout, effectively managing the spectacular action scenes along with Gilroy's crisp dialog. 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is one of the great action movies, and I would welcome another return of Jason Bourne with Greengrass and Damon.",10,1,2,5 August 2007
The Aviator," Open the Door...
","Martin Scorsese's 'The Aviator' is grand spectacle with a reverence for the nostalgic, set in simpler times. As a snapshot of Howard Hughes's life from 1927 to 1947, 'The Aviator' is a portrait of a man of genius and unmatched innovation, and also a man debilitated by severe obsessive compulsive disorder and extreme depression. 'The Aviator' has an amazing performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes, and a mesmerizing performance by Cate Blanchett, who seems to inhabit the role of Katherine Hepburn-- the love of Hughes's life. However, the one indelible image I have of the film is the scene in which Hughes is frozen in the men's restroom, because he can't make himself touch the door knob for fear of germs and contamination. Granted this was a time before obsessive compulsive disorder existed as a diagnosis. The scene is intended as a dramatic arc, distinguishing a tragic flaw in Hughes. However, for me it seemed overly indulgent, and was curious regarding the scene length. Much like most of the nearly 3 hour movie, this is an exercise in indulgence, and attention to detail that is only that. Scorsese's balance between Hughes's genius and his great suffering is good melodrama, but not very inspiring. I have a particular affinity for Howard Hughes the man. Had John Lone's (and Michael Mann's) story followed Hughes through the 1950's and beyond, the story would be even sadder. 'The Aviator' illustrates the highs of genius, and the abyss of near insanity. This is an accurate depiction of an amazing man's life, but it is skewed toward the broken aspect. So just personally for me, it was frustrating to watch. To Scorsese's credit, one gets that he has immense compassion for Howard Hughes.Hughes' life sentence is established in the opening scene. Hughes's mother while bathing the young Hughes, tells him something that perhaps leads to his obsessive compulsive nature. Apparently he is incomplete in his relationship with his mother, and the story surrounding what she said.Fast forward to 1927, when Hughes left his father's wealthy drill bit tool company in Texas, to be a maverick film maker in California. Hughes is an ambitious and novice film director, but he is smart and has unmatched drive. However, his real genius is as a pilot and an innovative designer of airplanes. His gifts for fame and fortune are established. Hughes (DiCaprio) then pursues a touching romance with Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett). This is the highlight of 'The Aviator', even amidst the spectacular aerial cinematography, because it is just about relationships that move people. There is a wonderful moment when Hughes lets Hepburn take control of his plane as they fly above Los Angeles at night. As great as the chemistry is between Dicaprio and Blanchett, this romance part of the story goes on a little too long in the context of the movie.From this point on, the movie becomes increasingly darker. Sure, Hughes has his share of triumphs, but everything is tempered by his spiraling decline into depression and his debilitating obsessive compulsive disorder. The acting is outstanding throughout the picture. This is Leonardo DiCaprio's most mature performance. He truly captures Hughes's intensity, genius, and charm. His suffering also elicits great compassion. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Kate Hepburn. At first one wonders whether she is doing a caricature of Hepburn. She is not. She is being Hepburn. Blanchett's performance is simply stunning. An unrecognizable Kate Beckinsale is awesome as Ava Gardner. Beckinsale gives surprising layers to Gardner, who is really not all that she appears to be on the surface. John C. Reilly is fabulous as Hughes's CFO. In an understated fashion Reilly's performance anchors the movie. Alec Baldwin as Pan Am CEO, Juan Trippe, and Matt Ross as Hughes's engineer Glenn Odekirk give strong performances.Scorsese's 'The Aviator' is spectacular to view, and has a sense of history and tragedy. He offers an interesting portrait of the dichotomy between genius and madness, with an emphasis on the dark. This choice really lost me. 'The Aviator' is amazing work, that is not very inspiring, though it was probably not intended to do so. That is a bit of a disappointment.",8,50,67,13 February 2005
Bohemian Rhapsody," Having 'Almost Everything'
","'Bohemian Rhapsody' soars to the heavens as the cinematic chronicle of the rise, fall and redemption of legendary rock band Queen and its charismatic lead singer Freddie Mercury, authentically inhabited by Rami Malek: The tragedy and joy of their iconic music. Yet, what touches foremost is the love story of Freddie and his soul mate Mary, played by radiantly strong Lucy Boynton.While lying in bed together after Freddie dazzled in Queen's concert, he confesses to Mary that the only place where 'I'm not afraid' is performing on stage. Mary loves Freddie. Still discovering his amazing voice through his music, he suffers in his inauthenticity, in his sexuality.After returning from a lengthy Queen tour, Freddie discloses his sexuality to Mary. He says, 'You are almost everything...' Mary is heartbroken. 'Almost' is never enough. That visceral sense of sadness resonates in Director Bryan Singer's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'.This very much is Bryan's film, although the studio fired him before the movie's completion. Another director completed the filming for theatrical release. Openly gay Bryan poignantly reminds: Finding and accepting your distinct voice is scary regardless of gay or straight. Announcing who you are to the world is terrifying for all of us. Bryan, Rami and Lucy compassionately say that we try to love ourselves and gift from what is within us. Freddie Mercury brilliantly did that.Freddie Mercury died of AIDS at 45 years old. I was a huge fan of Freddie back in high school. Freddie had flamboyant charisma and the voice of an angel. I found cathartic joy in Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody', 'We Will Rock You' or 'We Are the Champions'. Although, Queen's music represented freedom, it ironically cloaked Freddie's suffering: To be himself. In his journey Rami astounds as Freddie.Accepting his life's deception, Rami's Freddie tells Mary in the pouring rain, 'I'm happy for you.' Lucy's tearful visage is her hope that Freddie discovers his own joy in life. Bryan Singer's narrative is about healing as Freddie sees what he has become and his fate. Rami is powerful vulnerability and humanity. You see his soulfulness in his eyes. You hear it in his voice. He beautifully regenerates the late Freddie's immortal sound. Rami expresses Freddie's vibrant spirit that captivated us all those years ago.'Bohemian Rhapsody' begins in London with young design student and Heathrow baggage laborer Freddie. He's the son of the Parsi family, followers of the Zoroastrian faith. Traditional Father Bromi, played by solid Ace Bhatti, disapproves of his son's choice not to follow in his professional footsteps. Freddie wants to be a rock star.His opportunity arises when guitar god Brian May, played by compassionately wise Gwilym Lee, needs a lead singer for his band. Brian and drummer Roger Taylor, played by spritely Ben Hardy, take a chance on Freddie. While joining the band, Freddie falls for beautiful kind Mary. Freddie eventually meets Paul, played by subversively charming Allen Leech, who reveals as the duplicitous seducer.At times Anthony McCarten's screenplay veers into the indulgent excess of the 'rock star' life, coming across as caricature. Yet, his narrative has the authentic feel for the creation of music as when Brian stamps out the beat for 'We Will Rock You.'In the end Anthony and Bryan create profound compassion for Freddie Mercury: Whether he is free to express his voice in the world, regardless of what others think. We care whether Freddie finds true love, again. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of sound, sadness, and joy. It will rock you, too.",10,11,17,18 November 2018
Burn After Reading," Not Funny
","At a tipping point in the Cohen Brothers' 'Burn After Reading', CIA Superior played by the wonderful J.K. Simmons ('Juno') and his CIA Officer played by hysterical straight man David Rasche have a profound exchange. Simmons says, 'So what did we learn from all this?' Bewildered Rasche replies, 'Um I don't know.' To which Simmons concludes, 'I don't f---ing know either.' That pretty much summed it up for me, after watching an hour and an half of 'Burn After Reading'. And with the movie's conclusion I soon left the theater.The most surprising thing about Ethan Cohen and Joel Cohen's 'Burn After Reading' is that it is not funnypainfully not. You have Oscar Winners George Clooney, Francis McDormand, and Tilda Swinton, and Oscar Nominees Brad Pitt and John Malkovich either playing complete idiots or raving psychos. Granted for some the Cohen Brothers are doing art here. However, the over acting particularly on the part of George Clooney as moronic Treasury Agent Harry Pfarrer, and complete moron personal fitness trainer Chad Feldheimer played by Brad Pitt is utterly embarrassing. The cast could have all taken the advice of Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus from 'Tropic Thunder', who in a cleaned up and politically correct vernacular advised actors to never play mentally disabled full out. Lazarus said it more plainly than I.One has to wonder during the making of the movie, that some assistant didn't say, 'Hey George, you might want to throttle back just a tad' The Cohen brothers are geniuses; but not here. The only actor that fairs well is Tilda Swinton which is a testament to her prowess and intelligence shining through. Here is the thing: Everyone in 'Burn After Reading' is stupid playing stupid as opposed to stupid playing smart--which would be funny. There is no inherent irony in the characters. And in the case of Clooney, Pitt, and McDormand their characters have the I.Q. of squash. It's like paraphrasing Forrest GumpStupid is, as stupid does. Rather here: stupid is stupid, and not funny.And with the characters that are not stupid like Malkovich's Osborne Cox; the man is an arrogant unsympathetic ass. I think Swinton, who plays Osborne's wife Katie in part gets a pass for having to put up with all the other idiots and her insufferable husband. Swinton's performance is killer, and has the only semblance of authenticity. Fortunately, the minor characters like the CIA guys, Simmons and Rasche, remind us that 'Burn After Reading' was intended as a macabre comedy. Giving the Cohen brothers their due: They execute the incongruous and macabre elements to perfection.'Burn After Reading' is the collision of the stone cold stupid and the heinously arrogant. Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is demoted as the CIA's top analyst, because he is an alcoholic. Instead Oz quits the CIA, and embarks upon writing his memoirs which would reveal classified information vital to national security. Oz's suffering wife is successful physician Katie Cox (Swinton). Katie is secretly having an affair with obtuse Treasury Agent Harry (Clooney). Somehow Oz's memoir CD turns up at a health club, and in the hands of Chad (Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Francis McDormand). Chad realizes that he and Linda could exhort the CD owner for a fortune. Aging personal trainer Linda sees this as the leveraging point for getting the money she desperately needs for cosmetic surgery and liposuction, which her HMO refuses to pay. Self absorbed Linda also pursues a relationship with the married Harry (Clooney) through an on-line dating service. Linda is blatantly unaware that her boss at the club, Ted (Richard Jenkins) is in love with her. Philandering Harry also promises Katie (Swinton) that he will leave his successful Children's book author wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel). Well, not really. All is intentionally and needlessly convoluted. In the end we really don't learn a f---ing thing. More disappointingly, 'Burn After Reading' is not really funny.",7,2,6,22 September 2008
Watchmen," Awe Inspired 'Watchmen'
","In Zack Snyder's 'Watchmen' the hero is flawed, very human, not necessarily noble, and perhaps more an artifact of whose side he stands. 'Watchmen' is mesmerizing and compelling. Snyder ('300') emerges as one of the premiere action directors and storytellers with a distinctive visual style. When Watchmen Rorschach (powerful Jackie Earle Haley) is interviewed by the prison psychiatrist, he confesses, 'God doesn't make the world this way. We do.' 'Watchmen' has amazing gravitas. In 'Watchmen' evils prevails in the world, and exists within its heroes.'Watchmen' is heroic tragedy in the struggle of questionable good against evil. The screenplay by David Hayter ('X-Men') and Alex Tse is based on the beloved graphic novel by Alan Moore that was illustrated by Dave Gibbons. 'Time Magazine' named 'Watchmen' as one the 100 Greatest Novels of the 20th Century. Set in an alternate 1985 where Richard Nixon has been President for 25 years, the threat of Cold War is very real with the Soviet Union. Superheroes are part of the American culture, until Nixon passes a law outlawing their masks.In 'Watchmen' most of the superheroes have no superpowers, except for Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is a shredded naked blue skinned man who can control matter, space, and time. At a story arc his lover Laurie/ Silk Spectre II (stunning Malin Akerman) asks Jon (Dr. Manhattan) to save the world. Jon replies, 'Why would I save a world I no longer have a stake in?' The god-like Dr. Manhattan has forfeited all his humanity.These heroes are not necessarily good people. The Comedian/ Edward Blake (stark and amazing Jeffery Dean Morgan) is a cold blooded killer and misogynist. Rorschach (Haley) is a sociopath. Androgynous billionaire Adrian Veidt (charismatic Matthew Goode) is the 'outted' superhero Ozymadias, who fancies himself as a modern day Alexander the Great. Dan (vulnerable Patrick Wilson) is the conflicted hero Nite Owl. Laurie Jupiter's (Malin Akerman) mother Sally (tragic Carla Gugino) is a bitter drunk hiding a dark secret. The nobility of 'Watchmen' is that each has to act heroically in the face of their failings.So 'Watchmen' are great fighters with amazing martial arts prowess. Dannon Caro and Richard Cetrone craft visually explosive fight sequences. However, 'Watchmen' apparently like the graphic novel is more than its action. 'Watchmen' is really a murder mystery that leads to an insidious global conspiracy in this grand morality play.The relentless hero seeking the truth is Rorschach (Haley), who wears a mask with morphing ink blot patterns, possessing unequaled force of will and fighting prowess. Deep personal suffering and genius haunt sociopath Rorschach's quest and existence. He is crazy; however, there is something so noble. Haley's portrayal is electrifying. Uncovering the truth, Rorschach says, 'Never compromise! Not even in the face of Armageddon.' The paradox: Rorschach will kill evil men without mercy, but for him the ends can never justify the means.'Watchmen' opens with the vicious murder of The Comedian (Morgan). Blake concedes, 'It's just a matter of time, I suppose.' Rorschach wonders if this is the first in the plot kill off the Watchmen, and pleads for Dan (Wilson) to help. Dan is no longer in the game. He meets with Veidt (Goode), who dismisses Rorschach as paranoid. In the meantime Rorschach reunites with Dr. Manhattan (Crudup) and Laurie (Akerman). Jon is obsessed in his work with Veidt to change the world; at the same time isolating himself from Laurie. Laurie eventually finds comfort and solace with Dan, who is a good man. For both there is a visceral sexual thrill in superhero.Amidst the melodrama on earth and Mars, Rorschach follows the murder trail that reveals a heinous conspiracy. To that end Zack Snyder weaves an astonishing tale. My bud Ron is a huge 'Watchmen' fan. He said that Snyder delivers about a 95% faithful translation. The outcome was altered from the book; however, he said that 'Watchmen' retains its spirit and emotional resonance.Snyder generates amazing performances from Haley and Morgan. All the performances are strong. Matthew Goode is a surprise as Veidt, who has the right balance of duplicity and nobility. Malin Akerman is commanding and sexy as Laurie. Patrick Wilson infuses great humanity in Dan. The compelling story, strong performances, and stunning visuals result in an awesome 'Watchmen'.",9,0,2,12 March 2009
Baby Driver," It's About the Girl
","'Baby Driver' is awesome. Ansel Elgort is the star. Elgort is a young Clint Eastwood. He has a quiet gentleness and undeniable power. Ansel was amazing in 'The Fault in Our Stars'. Here he shines brighter than Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Jon Hamm, who are much older and all great. In the opening scene Baby, played by Elgort, races away in robbery getaway heist in his red Mitsubishi with beguiling mastery. He is a protégé of sorts. Writer and Director Edgar Wright goes full throttle from the start, while subtly painting the portrait of his hero Baby. Baby is a kid in his twenties, who is plugged into his headphones from his iPod, to drown out the noise. He has Tinnitus, a ringing in his ears, the result of a tragic car accident when he was a child, revealed in flashback. Wright's car chase sequence is astounding. Baby drives fearlessly, ice water in his veins. However, he drives like a chess master. Wright is brilliant in his layered character reveal. And Elgort's unassuming charisma fuels this. For me the signature scene unfolds when Baby grasps the hand of Jamie Foxx's Bats as he tries to draw his Beretta on the love of his life Debora. Elgort's Baby gazes into the eyes of Bats, 'No.' Elgort has the calm power and resolve embodying Wright's story of love and courage. The most compelling occurs not when 'Baby Driver' is roaring 140 mph, rather in the blossoming romance of Baby and waitress Debora, played by radiant and beautiful Lily James. Baby records Debora singing in his favorite diner. Then the two talk about their favorite music and song. Debora and Baby are sweet and kind to each other. Spectacular car chases and automatic weapons battles aside, 'Baby Driver' is really 'about the girl'. As with most great stories, this is usually true. Kevin Spacey is Doc, the robbery maestro who orchestrates the mayhem. His star driver is Baby. Doc's crew includes the couple Buddy and Darling, played by solid Jon Hamm and Eliza Gonzalez. Baby teams with Bats, played by calculated cold Jamie Foxx, for one more job to get straight in the bond beholding him to his boss and mentor Doc. Thinking he is free, and be with Debora, Baby soon discovers that 'straight' doesn't mean done for Doc. Baby lives with his deaf and wheelchair bound guardian Joseph, played by kind C.J. Jones. They touchingly converse in sign language. In the amazing dance sequence Baby makes a sandwich for Joseph, while plugged into his tunes. The music not only tones 'Baby Driver', it defines it. Director Wright seamlessly atmospheres the songs ranging from Barry White, Lionel Richie to Queen as the provocative narrative. At times the movie is an elegant musical with song and dance set amidst mesmerizing action. This is distinctly 'Baby Driver''s art and profound charm. Betrayal, conspiracy, and gunfire abound in Wright's visual portrait. The sharp furious dialogue of Doc, Bats, Buddy, and Darling are captivating, though ultimately for show. Really, this is 'full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.' This only accentuates the quiet and measured eloquence of Baby. Baby knows he is cursed as a thief, lives by a code, and lives for love. Kevin Spacey is surprising and powerful as Doc. He reveals not as we expect, displaying nobility in the end. Like both Spacey and Elgort, 'Baby Driver' is a surprise. Yes, it is the visual adrenaline thrill ride. What touches most: 'Baby Driver' is about the girl.",10,20,38,2 July 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Heroic Fellowship
","Peter Jackson's first installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien, 'Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' is masterful work with another outstanding performance from Sir Ian McKellen and a star-making performance from Viggo Mortensen as the Ranger, Strider. I have not read the Tolkien trilogy, though I was read 'The Hobbit' way back in sixth grade. So I am not familiar with the Tolkien mythology and legacy. From what is presented on screen, screenwriters, Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson, have crafted a story of magic, courage, and honor. Peter Jackson gets great performances out of a large and talented cast, manages stunning visuals that never overwhelm the movie, and maintains a coherent narrative style. The narrative at the movie's beginning was necessary for a novice like myself. The One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron must be destroyed or all will be lost in Middle-earth. The Ring possesses great power and the seductive power of evil. The Ring that has been lost for 2500 years ends up in the hands of Hobbit, Frodo (Elija Wood). The powerful wizard, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) recognizes the Ring for what it is. Frodo's charge is to destroy the Ring. Soon a Fellowship is formed to aid Frodo in his quest. There are Elves, Dwarfs, Hobbits, Orcs, and Humans along the way. The journey is filled both with bravery and betrayal. Gandalf's master, Saruman (Christopher Lee), has aligned himself with Lord Sauron. The Ranger, Strider (Viggo Mortensen), becomes the protector of the brave Frodo. The first hour moves very slow under the weight of the material and set up. The last two hours of the movie move briskly. This is a very stuffed 3 hour movie that does not feel longer than that, or shorter. What makes 'Fellowship of the Rings' so captivating is it's tale of heroes and great warriors. Elija Wood does an amazing job in the transformation of Frodo. At first Frodo is overwhelmed by the responsibility he undertakes, then he sees that he must do what is right, and he realizes that he is not alone. Wood combines the anxiety and courage magically. Ian McKellan is awesome as Gandalf. As the powerful and aging wizard he is the leader that inspires greatness in others. Viggo Mortensen as Strider/ Aragorn is charismatic, and the soul of the 'Fellowship.' Strider is a great warrior and a true samurai. Strider gives his word to Frodo that he will protect him with his life, and he keeps his word. Mortensen plays Strider as man of few words, backed up by action, compassion, and seemingly haunted by a dark secret. He absolutely commands the screen. Also impressive are Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the Elf archer, and Sean Bean as the warrior Boromir, who battles the seductive power of the Ring. Cate Blanchett also gives a great performance as Galadriel, the muse of this Fellowship. Liv Tyler is beautiful as Arwen, though she does have much of a role in this installment.Peter Jackson's 'Fellowship of the Ring' is masterful storytelling with great performances from a very talented cast. I look forward to rest of the movies.",10,1,1,12 January 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Full of Sound and Fury...
","Though 'The Matrix Revolutions' does not deserve the reference consider: Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time; And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more. It is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.<ul><li>Macbeth</li></ul>No, Andy and Larry Wachowski are not Shakespeare. However, after 2 hours and 4 minutes of 'sound and fury', we don't even get a profound relationship to nothing or empty and meaningless. Instead we get eclectic cyber-Taoism in a well intentioned, but unsatisfying conclusion of what was once a captivating messiah tale. The Wachowski Brothers could have really taken a cue from Bill-- less is more. Really. Revolutions is a technical marvel, with some good performances-- Keanu Reeves included. Though this Act III along with Act II (Reloaded) will forever, taint the wonder and possibility of 'The Matrix'. This is the biggest travesty of all. 'Revolutions' starts off so promisingly. Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) confront the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). Trinity says 'You give me Neo, or we all die, right here, right now.' Trinity is willing to die for Neo (Keanu Reeves), perhaps hinting that 'Revolutions' will have a significant love story back drop. Great. No, not really. Rather it could have been strong, and made the movie a lot more human. As the story opens Neo is caught in some realm between the Matrix and the Machine World. There is something like 20 hours before the last human refuge, Zion, will be under siege by the Sentinels (deadly octopus-like machines). Neo being The One is the only human who can save Zion. We get the insight that Agent Smith (a very effective Hugo Weaving)is in fact a cyber virus. Also Neo and Agent Smith are the same--rather one can not exist without the other. This is The Matrix version of Yin and Yang. The evolving Neo can also jump between the real world and The Matrix without being 'jacked in'. This leads to some amazing circular logic as the story unfolds tearing large holes in conscience and time. Ultimately, Revolutions becomes a souless exercise-- which is unfortunate. This is largely due to the plot. Consequently, this wastes some good performances. Reeves is better this time around as Neo, the chosen One. He is the tragic hero. Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity is strong and understated. She has some awesome scenes, but they are few. I really love her character.Jada Pinkett Smith's role of Captain Niobe is more deserving of her talents as compared to 'Reloaded'. She is strong, smart, and gorgeous. The stand out is Collin Chou as Seraph, Guardian of The Oracle (Mary Alice). Chou is cool, good-looking, and charismatic. He is a great martial artist. His fight scenes are stunning. In the end, after all the noise, some questions have been answered, more generated, and logic warped beyond belief. Some may feel cheated, but I suspect most really don't care. Because the story does not respect our affinity for the characters in The Matrix, instead opting for the very clever and esoteric ending. In the beginning of the movie, Love is described as a human construct. It is. And I think the Wachowski Brother forget what they were arguing for. Getting nothing would have been better.",6,0,0,13 November 2003
Man of Steel," Super 'Man of Steel'
","Traumatized by his emerging super senses of hearing and x-ray vision, 9 year-old Clark Kent (quiet Cooper Timberline) says, 'The world's too big, Mom.' His Mom Martha played by the lovingly wise Diane Lane, says, 'Then make it small' This is ironic coming from the boy, who grows into Superman. Zack Snyder's reinvention of the Superman mythology in 'Man of Steel' is awesome. It is and not necessarily for the obvious. Yes, the movie is infused with visually striking images, in the epic struggle of good against evil. In the mesmerizing story and screenplay by Writer David S. Goyer and Writer/Producer Christopher Nolan ('The Dark Knight' movies), Clark's true power sources not so much from his physical prowess, rather from the love of family.Clark becomes the man, who changes the world, from the love of his two Fathers, Jor-El played by Russell Crowe and Jonathan Kent played by Kevin Costner in his best supporting role in years. Their gravitas and authentic belief in their son be it by blood or choice, distinguishes 'Man of Steel'. Perhaps fittingly, 'Man of Steel' opened on Father's Day Weekend. For Goyer and Nolan, Clark or Kal-El is Superman, not the other way around, and that is the profound difference. They also construct a hysterical joke about the title Superman. In a flashback on the Kansas Farm, Costner's Jonathan tells teenage Clark (sensitive Dylan Sprayberry), 'You have to decide what kind of man you are going to be.' Destiny lies in choice.Henry Cavill is amazing as Clark and Kal-El. He is ridiculously handsome with high cheekbones and heroic jaw line. His rock hard body is chiseled and shredded with or without the suit. He is charismatic without many lines. I had read reviews that label Cavill and the movie as overly dour. Perhaps overstated. Cavill has genuine commanding presence, and displays touching doubt and humor. He is wryly funny as he explains to Amy Adams's Lois Lane that the symbol on his chest means Hope on his planet. He and Costner are deeply moving in Clark's defining moment in the Smallville storm.It is surprising when Cavill finally dons the iconic and in this case also recreated Suit in 'Man of Steel'. In this story bearded Clark (Cavill) is a wanderer, kind of like John Rambo, helping people and discovering his destiny. This is not your Father's Superman. This narrative affinity is distinctly Nolan as with Christian Bale in 'Batman Begins'. Cavill is poignantly enrolling as Clark struggles to harness and disguise his power.I have to digress. But how does Superman shave? Kryptonite Fusion blade? No Kryptonite in 'Man of Steel'. The choice by Snyder and company is the right one. 'Man of Steel' is really about the power of love and cost of sacrifice. That element would have been a narrative distraction. This streamlined retelling is puzzling at first, though ultimately sublime.Much of the prelude resumes on the dying home world Krypton that orbits its Red Sun which has a 'Matrix' and 'Star Trek' like visual vibe. Benevolent Scientist Jor-El (Crowe at his noble best) warns the Council of Krypton's demise—aftermath of their own brazen irresponsibility. Simultaneously, evil General Zod (menacing Michael Shannon) and his warriors mount a coup to restore Krypton's greatness. Refreshingly, Crowe's Jor-El is a kick-ass hero warrior as well. His son Kal-El is the first natural birth in centuries, having his own choice in uncovering his destiny. Jor-El and Lara scheme to send Kal-El to Earth for salvation. With the Yellow Sun, and other attributes Kal-El would be a god among Men, or rather a Messiah. This was always a captivating metaphor of the Superman story. However, tragedy befalls the House of El. Zod and his Minions are banished to the Phantom Zone for centuries, not before declaring his vengeance.Amy Adams is perfection as Lois Lane, brilliantly cast. This time around she is the determined Pulitzer Prize Winning Report, searching for the enigmatic Good Samaritan Clark. The twist works, because being fooled by the mild mannered glasses is utterly moronic. As Lois, Adams is strong and beautiful yet vulnerable. She and Cavill have a visceral chemistry, whimsically touching.The last 45 minutes of 'Man of Steel' is riveting, visually unrelenting chaos, with Hans Zimmer's hammering score. Explosions startle and rubble rains everywhere. You can practically feel the Dolby impact as Kal-El and Zod exchange punishing blows. Along the way we encounter some weird story glitches. Zod was bread and trained to be the deadly warrior; however, Kal-El predictably holds his own. Gorgeous and scary Antje Traue really schools Kal-El with some Kryptonian martial arts. Snyder is often baffling in the coherent strength scale of his hero and villains, but oh well. He does make the flying look cool. The rest of the supporting cast is stellar particularly, Laurence Fishburne as scene stealing Perry White and Chris Meloni as brave Col. Hardy.'Man of Steel' soars in this hero's journey, wondrous re-visioning by Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan. Henry Cavill is amazing. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe are awesome in the story of Fathers' love for their son. 'Man of Steel' is awesome as well.",10,6,12,16 June 2013
21," Dazzle?
","In '21' M.I.T. mathematics Professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) and boy genius Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) discuss an intriguing mathematical paradox surrounding the game show 'Let's Make A Deal'. In the 'Let's Make A Deal' scenario, the contestant is offered one of three doors. Behind one of the three doors is a trip to Hawaii. Behind the other two doors are two goats. After making a door selection, one of the two unselected doors is open to reveal a goat. Now the contestant is offered a chance to change his original selection. Ben says that it is incumbent to now select the other door. The point being, that when he originally made the choice, the probability of picking correctly was one third. Given this new information, the probability changed from one third to now a half. Still not intuitive to me, this is amazingly intriguing. The rest of Director Robert Luketic's '21' is not entirely intriguing, although it is entertaining for what it is. Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb's screenplay based on the book by Ben Mezrich, is a kinetic and over-the-top rites of passage tale involving our hero Ben, well played by Jim Sturgess. The over the top elements are chewed on by the performances of Kevin Spacey as Micky and Laurence Fishburne as old school casino surveillance expert Cole Williams.My bud John had read the book 'Bringing Down the House', but told me that there was no Professor Ringleader character. So that is an interesting narrative choice by Steinfeld and Loeb. For the most part it works, as Spacey does his charismatic best, providing a visceral protagonist for Ben as he reclaims his soul. Ben (Sturgess) is a brilliant M.I.T. student, even for an M.I.T. student. Ben's future at Harvard Medical School relies upon him winning a prestigious scholarship of which he is one of 41 applicants. The dean challenges Ben, 'Dazzle me' Micky (Spacey) acknowledging Ben's brilliance attempts to enroll Ben in his assembled team to win big at Blackjack in Las Vegas. Here Luketic bends over backwards to clarify that this innovative strategy is not 'card counting'. Oh, well. Circumstances mount, and Ben agrees to join the team which includes the beautiful and fetching Jill (smart and tough Kate Bosworth). Ben becomes a star, and predictably alienates his geek buddies Miles and Cam (believable Josh Gad and Sam Golzari), who were depending on his partnership for critical science competition. Ben is seduced by the dark side: money, sex, and power. He also falls for Jill. But the ride can't last foreverat least not in these kinds of stories. Betrayal and retribution eventually reign supreme. However, Jim Sturgess as Ben keeps '21' engaging. He's got a natural, smart, and edgy charisma which weathers most the narrative flat spots and formula.'21' also has sense of corny justice and karma. In the end, Ben in his low key and confident way gets to ask, 'Did I dazzle you?' '21' is not great cinema. But for what it isit is a smart and entertaining time at the movies.",7,2,4,13 April 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Deathly Loss of Innocence
","Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), the Chosen One, and his best friend Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) huddle together in the snow covered forest her Muggle parents took her as a young child. Hermione confides that these woods are as she remembered, but 'We have changed'. Much has changed in 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1'. Gone are the days of innocence and the wonder of youth in the pursuit of true magic. 'Deathly Hallows' veers dour and menacing. The Dark Lord Voldemort (charismatic evil Ralph Fiennes) declares, 'I shall be the one to kill Harry Potter!' In this dark envisioning of J.K. Rowling's final book: It is now 'time to put away childish things'. David Yates expertly directs this, and the concluding Part 2, as he did in the previous 2 movies. 'Deathly Hallows' is more craft than art.We have all witnessed the journey of Harry, Hermione, and Ron (Rupert Grint) through the last 10 years and 6 books. Our children have grown up literally before our eyes. Director Yates is craftsman-like in his creation beholding to Steve Kloves's screenplay laden with precision. I have not read the Rowling's books. My bud Chuck told me that this movie is very loyal to the book—maybe painfully so. Although Yates's creation is sturdy and captivating, he is not creating art. The score by Alexandre Desplat elicits the gravity and significance of the story. Yates and Kloves's narrative is by the numbers, lacking an edge or sense of foreboding danger. Yates fails to leverage the most enticing dynamic of all: Whom does Hermione truly love? Ron? Harry? Singer Sting once said the most interesting love songs are about 'I love you. You love someone else.' This also seems to be a glaring void.Our young transforming heroes must risk all to protect avatar Harry, and check Voldemort from possessing the triad of the Deathly Hallows; thus making him 'master of death'. 'Harry Potter' has always embodied love and humanity. The narrative is ambitious in making palatable the vast amount of source material, and converging upon the eternal battle of good against evil. However, we don't get much insight into Harry, Ron, and Hermione—characters we have all grown to love. Granted this is not the concluding act of this saga.This is too bad, given that all have evolved into wonderful actors. Particularly, Emma Watson displays a self-aware loss of innocence and lonely sadness as Hermione. She is the emotional anchor as Harry expands into the hero he is fated. Daniel Radcliffe is both commanding and vulnerable as Harry. He nuances Harry's fear of his own darkness. He must reconcile whether he is savior or merciless avenger. Voldemort killed his parents, and in twisted way defined Harry. Harry suffers the guilt of being powerless to stop Severus Snape (strong Alan Rickman) from killing his mentor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Radcliffe holds his own with the powerful Fiennes. Surprisingly, Harry does not say anything memorable as the emerging hero at this juncture. Grint as Ron tires of being Harry's sidekick. Grint does his best to elevate Ron beyond the angst ridden teen finding his path and embracing true love, possibly with Hermione.In 'Deathly Hallows' our heroes leave the security of Hogwarts behind, and venture into the chaotic and unforgiving world. Lead by Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and 'Mad Eye' Moody the young wizards and witches risk their lives to protect Harry from Voldemort and his minions, until Harry turns 17 years old. A malevolent conspiracy is brewing. Lord Voldemort has vanquished vestiges of his soul into vessels called Horcruxes, ensuring his immortality. Hermione uncovers Voldemort scheme, and determines that they must destroy all the Horcruxes. In the balance is Voldemort's emergence as omniscient master of death and vanquisher of the Chosen One—Harry. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' has striking action and visuals; however, it is deathly slow for the first half. The movie redeems itself toward the end.However, this may be more the calm before the storm and the concluding chapter. The 'Deathly Hallows' is calculated and sturdy, but lacks a sense of wonder and magic that made the series classic. Perhaps, Part 2 risks and challenges all.",9,2,2,25 November 2010
Kung Fu Panda 2," Let It Flow
","In 'Kung Fu Panda 2' after an exquisite Wushu display, Shifu (voiced by venerable and irreverent Dustin Hoffman) says to student Po (Jack Black), 'Anything is possible, when you have inner peace.' This belies a certain authenticity. The Founder of Aikido said, 'True victory is victory over oneself.' At the narrative arc, sage Soothsayer, voiced with eloquent gravitas by the amazing Michelle Yeoh, instructs the Kung fu Panda Po, 'Let it flow.' She tells him to let go of his painful stories of the past. In doing so, he has nothing, and everything is possible. She reminds Po that all he has is right now, and the rest of his life. 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is whimsically funny in the unexpectedly transformational journey.The story by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger, and Robert Koo enhances the original 'Kung Fu Panda'. First time Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson captures the essence of the martial arts path from ingenious angles without significance—a smart thing. She seamlessly fuses kung fu choreography and the spirit of the way in 'Kung Fu Panda 2'. I did not see the movie in 3D, though it is visually breathtaking. We see serene mist covered mountain forests, austere castles, and elegantly crafted pagodas.In the movie's preface, Soothsayer (Yeoh) narrates the story of the ruling Peacock Clan in ancient China. The heir to the Kingdom is the arrogant Shen (ominously dark and wounded Gary Oldman). Prophesy foretells of his defeat by the Black and White chosen one. In a Machiavellian attempt to alter his fate, Shen orders the genocide of the Panda. Abhorred by the bloody actions of their son, Shen's parents banish him from the Kingdom. Shen vows vengeance. But has Shen truly altered fate? As no surprise and the source of irony in 'Kung Fu Panda' Mr. Ping (wise and funny James Hong) reveals to Po that he was adopted, somewhat. Given that Mr. Ping is a goose, not a real 'aha' moment. So Po must discover who he is, physically and spiritually.Since Po became the Dragon Warrior, profoundly getting that there is no great secret, he leads the Furious Five against all evil doers. However, Po still seems a bit of a goof, not really the Kung fu Master. This may just be the clumsy charm of Jack Black's embodiment. Strong and slender Tigress (sublimely confident Angelina Jolie) is clearly the powerful martial artist. She in fact schools Po in her prowess on occasion. We begin to wonder if, Tigress was really the chosen one, not Po. Jolie is subtle in dialing down Tigress's arrogance and impatience with her leader. 'Kung Fu Panda 2' works in the compassionate partnership of Black and Jolie, and the evil force of Oldman as the merciless Shen. Other members of the Furious Five appear relegated to the background this time around.In this story, Shen has created a massively powerful weapon that may vanquish Kung fu. So Po must end Shen's path of vengeance and domination. More importantly, Po must discover who he is and find the peace within. Yeoh as Soothsayer is impeccable eloquence assuming the helm for Shifu (Hoffman) as Po's guide in his transformation into mastery. Black is surprising in balancing humility, gravity, and whimsy. 'Kung Fu Panda 2' is hilarious, and state of the art CGI animation. What really inspire are the performances of Yeoh and Black, in the story of the hero reconciling the world and finding peace. 'Kung Fu Panda 2' gets it right in this noblest of pursuits.",9,0,1,10 June 2011
"I, Robot"," Solid Robot
","Alex Proyas's 'I, Robot' starring Will Smith is a solid action thriller that is visually provocative, inspired by the Isaac Asimov book. I remember reading the Asimov classic back in junior high, but not much else. The Three Laws of Robotics basically mandate that a robot shall not kill a human regardless of circumstance. The world according to Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldman's screenplay, has an apparent loop hole. It is 2035. Robots are part of the human experience and lexicon. U.S. Robotics (USR) is releasing a new model of robot, where soon there will be a robot for every 20 people. USR's CEO, Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) dreams of revolutionizing the world with the release of this new model. Going back to the loop hole, a robot stands implicated of murder. This robot, Sonny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), did not just kill anyone. Sonny stands accused of killing the inventor of the Three Laws of Robotics, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell). Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates Lanning's murder at the request of the late Dr. Lanning's interactive holographic recording of himself. The irony is that the physically recovering, Spooner (Smith) is robot-phobic. This is further revealed and articulated as the story unfolds. 'I, Robot' has a good sense of humor for a science fiction thriller. After the intense interrogation with Sonny, Spooner tells his chief, that he yearns for the old days when 'people killed people'. During his investigation Spooner enrolls the expertise of Dr. Susan Calvin (the smart and beautiful Bridget Moynahan), who is a psychologist working to make robots more human-like at USR. Calvin's examination indicates that Sonny may be in fact sentient. This seems to further contradict the breach of the Three Laws when Dr. Lanning was murdered. Is there a conspiracy against humans? Dr. Calvin refuses to acknowledge this possibility. To which Spooner responds, 'You are the dumbest smart person I know...' Awesome line. Yes, there is a conspiracy-- which is not shocking given that this is an action thriller. So Spooner and Calvin do their heroic best to save Chicago, circa 2035. Director Alex Proyas orchestrates a brisk pace, and his visuals are amazing, particularly with the mass invasion of the robots in the city. I have been a fan of Proyas since his work on 'The Crow'. 'I, Robot' is a great looking big budget movie. Will Smith is quickly becoming the action star icon. There is no one cooler than Big Will. He is handsome, funny, and full of attitude. He bulked and got ripped for his role as Spooner. It's amusing that in the beginning of the movie to establish the complexity of Spooner, the muscular Smith has a nude shower scene. Well, when he looks the way he does, he is entitled. Aside from that star stroke, Smith is one of the most charming actors, and he has a genuine screen presence. Smith is the focal point of 'I, Robot' amidst the spectacular visual effects. Bridget Moynahan as Susan Calvin is a strong foil to Smith. Her studied caution balances Spooner's reckless intensity. Moynahan is very good. She fleshes out what could have been a card board character. She is also gorgeous. She and Smith have great chemistry. Bruce Greenwood is excellent as the ruthless and enterprising corporate baron. Alex Proyas's visionary style, and Will Smith's star power make 'I, Robot' enjoyable to watch, and for the most part it is compelling viewing. And somewhere in there remember that this was all inspired by Asimov. It is a tribute to his genius.",8,0,0,20 August 2004
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Into the Spider-Verse: Take a Leap of Faith
","'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is astounding stylized state-of-art animation with the look and feel of 3-D Japanese Anime. The animation is visually shadowed and soulful with vibrant pastels. Not just mesmerizing eye-candy, team of Directors - Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman craft a fresh rites of passage narrative of immerging Spider-Man, half-African American Miles Morales, voiced by spirited and smart Shameik Moore. Although in Phil Lord ('The Lego Movie' and '22 Jump Street') and Rodney Rothman's screenplay, Miles is one of several 'Spider-Men' and 'Spider-Women' intersecting in this Marvel superhero, sci-fi, family mashup.Turns out that villain 'Kingpin', voiced by malevolent Live Schreiber, the blockish hulking bald cartoon figure used his invention - the Super Collider to collapse the multiverse. To what ends? Honestly, I don't think even Phil and Rodney know. That might be beside the point. Because, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is just raucous fun with a warped sense of humor and a big heart.Directors Bob, Peter and Rodney introduce the Spider-Man in New York that we all know and love: Peter Parker, voiced by whimsical Chris Pine. He's the guy, who was bitten by the radioactive spider that gave him his amazing strength, agility and 'spidey sense' as in sixth sense. After an extended Superhero career of 22 years including his failed marriage to the love of his life Mary Jane, voice by Zoe Kravitz, Spider-Man dies as a Hero, doing what he loves to do: Saving others.Miles is a teen attending a college prep school on scholarship: The brilliant computer geek, who chills to Post Malone. His Dad Jefferson Davis, voiced by stalwart funny Brian Tyree Henry, is a police officer, who not a big fan of Spider-Man and his 'along with great power comes great responsibility' dogma. Somewhat self-absorbed, he unconditionally loves Miles. Jefferson even coerces Miles to say, 'I love you, Dad.' - in front of his entire school.At school Miles is sweet on pretty smart blonde Gwen Stacy, voiced by wonderfully aloof Hailee Steinfeld. Their attraction is mutual. Miles derives security in his relationship with his Uncle Aaron, voiced with street gravitas by Mahershala Ali. Aaron and his brother Jefferson Davis are estranged, given Aaron questionable shady dealings. Yet, Aaron is the cool Uncle, who encourages Miles's distinct gift as the street tagger of amazing urban spray paint murals. While working one of his masterpieces, Miles is bitten by what looks like a radioactive spider. Consequently, Miles acquires his Spider-Man powers.At the same time Miles meets his alter-dimensional persona in older paunchy Peter B. Parker, voiced by funny, mildly cynical Jake Johnson, who teaches Miles the ropes of Spider-Man's web-slinging. While escaping from Kingpin's facility and swinging through the snowy forests, Peter and Miles encounter sleek white suited Spider-Gwen - Gwen Stacy (Hailee). Turns out too, that Gwen is the Spider-Woman from yet another dimension. Like Peter, she also needs to return to her home dimension.So it's up to Miles, who must wrestle control of Kingpin's Super Collider, to forge the dimensional pathway back to their respective dimensions. Meanwhile, Miles meets Spider-Men from other dimensions. Black and white Spider-Man Noir, voiced by off-the-wall Nicolas Cage, is from a past dimensional era. There's Warner Brothers-like cartoon Spider-Ham, voiced by hysterical John Mulaney. Life-size Japanese Anime Peni Parker, voiced by quirky Kimiko Glenn, is from the 31st Century sporting her advanced robotic Spider-Man. As Peter says, 'This could literally not get weirder.' Balancing this phase-glitched universe are versions of Spider-Man's villains: Green Goblin, Scorpion, and a few others that I don't recognize.There is a whole lot of nonsense running amok in 'Into the Spider-Verse', yet the directors resonate in asking, 'What makes a Hero?' With surprising poignancy, cartoon Spider-Ham tells emerging Hero Miles, 'You can't save everyone.' Otherwise, the great responsibility and power become a curse.When Miles has doubts that he can become the Hero, Peter tells him, 'Take a leap of faith.' Believe in the hero that's within all of us. Our Heroes arise from our belief from within, and from the love those who believe in us. For Miles that's the world-weary and wise Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, and brave and compassionate Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Radiant Shameik Moore makes us believe that his Miles shall discover his own greater than self within.'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is about summoning the Hero within all of us. Even more so than the amazing animation, that narrative makes 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' one of my favorite movies this year.",10,7,13,24 December 2018
Wanted," 'Wanted' Nearly Awesome
","Up until the last 3 minutes I thought Director Timur Bekmambetov's 'Wanted' was the coolest movie ever made. The campy dialogue at its conclusion does the movie in. In context this is surprising. 'Wanted' is completely over the top orchestrated chaos and violence, and classy camp is just part of the deal. Ultimately, the script douses the movie's innate genius and style. 'Wanted' is blatantly reminiscent of 'The Matrix'. Writers Michael Brandt, Derek Haas, and Chris Morgan wrote their screenplay based on the graphic novel by Mark Millar and J.G. Jones. Unlike the cyber reality of 'The Matrix', 'Wanted' invents the mythology of the 1000 year old Fraternity—prolific assassins. The Fraternity terminates designated targets and maintains the balance of good and evil in the world. Theirs is a dark world of order and secrecy. Members of the Fraternity have the distinct inherited ability to control the adrenaline in their bodies. Consequently, they can seemingly summon great physical strength, speed, agility, and reflexes at will. As part of their Zen-like training they can curve the trajectory of bullets. They are the ultimate assassins. Angelina Jolie is amazing and so darkly charismatic as Fox, the Fraternity's elite assassin. James McAvoy captures the emerging hero Wesley, who is so disgusted with his ordinary life.Curved accelerating bullets, high speed automatic weapons blazing from a red Viper, and the cataclysmic derailing train during assassination attempt characterize the bold and maverick style of Bekmambetov's 'Wanted'. Most of the narrative shortcomings are diluted by the director's blinding pace—mostly.McAvoy plays Wesley, a panic suffering account manager working for tyrannical morbidly obese office manager Janice (greatly evil Lorna Scott). Wesley is hooked on anxiety medication, enduring his venomous girlfriend Cathy (pretty Kristen Hager). Wesley's co-worker Barry (comically dense Chris Pratt) is having sex with Cathy, which Wesley also knows. One day while Wesley is refilling anxiety medication prescription he encounters strikingly beautiful Fox (Jolie). Fox tells Wesley that his father, perhaps the greatest assassin who ever lived, was killed the day before. Wesley had thought his father had died soon after he was born. What ensues is spectacularly orchestrated carnage and mayhem with Fox, Wesley, and apparently the man who killed Wesley's father—Cross (silently charismatic Thomas Kretschmann). What also follows is one of the most amazing car chases in movies.Fox brings Wesley to Fraternity Leader Sloan (ultra cool Morgan Freeman). Sloan demonstrates to Wesley his legacy and innate gifts. He invites him to 'take control of your own destiny', and join the Fraternity. After predictable soul searching, Wesley chooses to join the Fraternity. Fox is charged with transforming wimpy Wesley into the next great master assassin. Wesley endures unbelievable physical beatings and training, toward one end—avenging his father's murder. Here Angelina Jolie emerges as a powerful force. Jolie's Fox has an air of quiet gravitas and profound sadness. In a great moment she recounts her tragic past, and then tells Wesley, 'Kill one. Maybe save a thousand.' James McAvoy plays the lead hero Wesley, but it is really Angelina Jolie's enigmatic presence that resonates throughout 'Wanted'. McAvoy brilliantly captures the angst and thrill of the young man reconciling his great powers. Freeman leverages his regal and calculated persona as Sloan. Jolie embodies a samurai soul that serves 'Wanted'. As Fox she is strong, vulnerable, and all about honor. Jolie is perhaps the most stunningly beautiful woman on the motion picture screen. She is a compelling actor, who performs all the action with pathos and élan.'Wanted' could have been one of the coolest movies of all time, had the story followed through and eased up a bit on the camp. That being said, 'Wanted' is a brilliant wild ride with killer performances from Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy. Hold on to your seats.",7,1,6,2 July 2008
Warrior," What You Fight For
","'Warrior' may be one of the best movies of the year that no one sees. That in itself is puzzling. Mixed martial arts and UFC are in the cultural mainstream; in fact MMA is more popular than professional boxing. Director and writer Gavin O'Connor did the amazing 'Miracle' a few years back about the 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey Team. So he has the touch for inspirational sports stories. In 'Warrior' estranged brothers Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) and Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) fight each other in the finals of the winner take all mixed martial arts tournament Sparta in Atlantic City. 'Warrior' is an inspired story of family, honor, and redemption. I applauded at the end of the movie along with the rest of the audience.'Warrior' is a paradox of styles as inspired by its leads. Tommy (Hardy) is the AWOL Marine war hero from Afghanistan. He literally tore off a submerged tank door, saving those inside. Tommy plows through opponents with sheer rage and power. He is explosive technique. We witness this as he savagely dismantles world middle weight contender 'Mad Dog' Grimes (cocky Erik Apple) with kicks, punches, and throws in an impromptu sparring session. Tommy mysteriously appears at his Dad's door step in Pittsburgh. He blames Paddy (powerful and sublime Nick Nolte) for the death of his mother. Brendan (Edgerton) is the high school physics teacher and former UFC fighter. He and his wife Tess (strong Jennifer Morrison) work several jobs to pay their upside down mortgage. Brendan gets an entry into Sparta to save his family home. He is smart and willing to take punishment to leverage his opponent's mistakes—getting a tap out. Brendan like Tommy has no love for their recovered drunk Dad (Nolte).At the narrative arc Brendan says to Tommy, 'I love you!' And neither will back down. I think O'Connor and writers Anthony Tambakis and Cliff Dorfman at times overstate the family dysfunction. 'Warrior' could have been leaner, as strange as that sounds. The mixed martial arts fighting are world class and many of the fighters are MMA stars. Former professional wrestling champion Kurt Angle is fierce and dominating as Russian champ Koba. His match with Brendan is vicious and amazing. 'Warrior' authentically gets the brutality and precision of mixed martial arts. Hardy and Edgerton are awesome. I read that Hardy trained intensely gaining 30 pounds of muscle. He broke ribs and fingers. Edgerton tore his knee out during the shoot.'Warrior' has a gritty atmosphere that is all about character and adversity. O'Connor seamlessly captures this in the simple camera shots and intimate dialog. He generates amazing performances. Edgerton is the delicate balance of compassion and focus. His Brendan is a good and decent man. Hardy has an electrifying enigmatic presence. He provokes a painful sadness and rage in Tommy, for whom honor and family are everything. Nick Nolte poignantly plays their broken father, who is pivotal in the redemption of his sons. Ultimately, 'Warrior' is about forgiveness and love. It is one of the year's best.",10,123,176,3 October 2011
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," Back with Pride
","Despite no air conditioning and several screaming babies in the theater, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa'. Even though according to my bud Ron, 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' had 37% more penguins, I was initially unconvinced. Directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath's 'Madagascar 2' proves far more than the broad children's animated feature. 'Madagascar 2' has a great story of love and family by Etan Cohenmuch better than the original story in 'Madagascar'. 'Madagascar 2' is also hysterical. When lion Alex (Ben Stiller) and bud zebra Marty (Chris Rock) attempt to demolish a dam, Alex asks, 'Do you have any dynamite?' Marty (Rock) wryly exclaims, 'Snap! I just used my last stick' To their credit Directors Darnell and McGrath expertly balance funny and sentimental. Visually, 'Madagascar 2' is breathtaking particularly in its sweeping African vistas. Hans Zimmer's musical score is equally spectacular.At the beginning of Cohen's narrative we discover the origins of lion cub Alex, and his fated path to the Central Park Zoo. Following the logical conclusion of 'Madagascar' our heroes Alex (Stiller), Marty (Rock), hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) are flying back to New York aboard the airplane piloted by head penguin Mort (hysterical Andy Richter) and his crew. Along for the ride are Lemur King Julian (comic genius Sacha Baron Cohen) and Maurice (funny Cedric the Entertainer). Predictably the plane never makes it to New York, instead crash landing in the heart of Africa. But before crashing Melman proclaims his unrequited love, 'Gloria I love you!' to a snoring Gloria, much to the amazement of Alex and Marty.Alex is soon reunited with his long lost father Zuba (the late Bernie Mac) and his Mom (sweet Sherrie Shepherd). Zuba proudly welcomes Alex to the pride. But not everyone rejoices, particularly rival lion Makunga (the great Alec Baldwin). The slithery and devious Makunga (Baldwin) schemes the demise of Zuba and Alex. The civilized and domesticated Alex finds he is soon out of his element, and Zuba begins to wonder if indeed his son is really destined to become the next Lion King. Here the story evolves unexpectedly into a poignant tale of great expectations and unconditional love. Mac brilliantly captures the spirit of Zuba, and he and Stiller have amazing chemistry. For comic relief while Melman yearns for Gloria's affections, Gloria is attracted to alpha male hippo Moto Moto (Will.I.Am). Mort (Richter) and his penguin crew squelch a chimp labor uprising in their quest to rebuild their airplane. And of course there is tough Grandma kicking some serious butt. Stiller, Rock, Smith, and Schwimmer are all natural and fit comfortably into their roles. Alec Baldwin and Sacha Baron Cohen demonstrate their comic prowess and take no prisoners.'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' works with its surprisingly touching story of family blended with its sense of the hysterical and absurd. Gangster penguins piloting the friendly skies are completely hilarious and ridiculous. Mostly, 'Madagascar 2' works because we care about their characters, and we have a vested interest in things turning out well. 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' is enjoyable and definitely worth seeing.",8,4,8,12 November 2008
Disturbia," Not What You Expect
","In the opening scene of the thriller 'Disturbia', Kale Brecht (Shia LaBeouf) and his father Daniel (Matt Craven) enjoy trout fishing in the mountains, spending some great father-son time. Kale's father is killed in a horrifying accident on the trip back home. A year later Kale punches his Spanish teacher, who goads him about his late father. Being still a minor, Kale is placed under literal house arrest for 3 months shackled with ankle bracelet tracking device. Yes, Kale is doing Martha Stewart time without the privileges. He is imprisoned in 'Disturbia'. His Mom Julie (Carrie-Anne Moss) is none too pleased. Julie is also dealing with the tragic loss; however, her compassion and patience are wearing. Director D.J. Caruso is an expert in providing relevant context, setting the rules of the game, and building menace and tension. Shia LaBeouf gives a spirited and captivating performance as Kale. LaBeouf breathes an authenticity in troubled teenager Kale. His Kale harbors a deep seeded guilt, and at the same time is smart, possessing a sense of humor. Caruso and his writers Christopher Landon and Carl Ellsworth keep this thriller noir fresh set in the tech world of XBox games, picture phones, and wireless access. 'Disturbia' is understated, and an amazingly executed thriller.Caruso effectively creates the confines of 'Disturbia'. Kale is on a short leash in his house arrest. If he travels outside tracking bracelet's perimeter, he has 30 seconds to get back or the police are summoned. In his slacker seclusion, Kale becomes a casual voyeur of the neighborhood. One of the objects of his attention is his stunningly beautiful neighbor, Ashley (Sarah Roemer). After all, he is a teenage boy, and Ashley is his age. Joining Kale in his voyeuristic pursuits is his bud Ronnie (Aaron Yoo). In his observations Kale becomes convinced that the mysterious Mr. Taylor (David Morse) is a serial killer. Kale soon enrolls Ashley and Ronnie in this obsession. Or is there some truth in this premise? Director Caruso brilliantly navigates the creepiness line of this apparent voyeurism. In a surprisingly touching scene, Kale comes clean with Ashley (Roemer). He says that when he sees Ashley looking at herself in the mirror he knows it is not out of vanity, but that she is really asking, 'Who am I?' 'Disturbia' is smart and populated by smart characters. David Morse brings a quiet visceral menace to Mr. Turner. This also works that Morse is a towering and powerful presence. Sarah Roemer does a star turn as Ashley. Roemer is beautiful and charismatic. She wonderfully leverages her character's intelligence and charm. Carrie-Anne Moss is great, and is so believable as Kale's suffering mother. As Julie, Moss embodies both strength and exasperation. Ultimately, 'Disturbia' works because of Shia LaBeouf. LaBeouf's Kale comes across as a real teenager just dealing with all that comes along with growing up. At times he is brash, and other times he is vulnerable. LaBeouf also masterfully hints at the strength and character that reside within Kale.'Disturbia' is an engrossing thriller, and a surprising hero's tale. D.J. Caruso effectively lays the context for his story and fleshes out his characters. Shia LaBeouf gives a wonderful performance along with the rest of the cast in this smart and taut thriller. Amazingly, 'Disturbia' is not what you would expect.",10,4,9,15 April 2007
Van Helsing," So many monsters...
","I really did not know what to expect from Stephen Sommers' 'Van Helsing' at least from the trailers. Was it going to be a light-hearted adventure, a classic tale of good versus evil, or just plain silly and entertaining? A key draw is Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, who is a great stage and screen actor, and this movie generation's classic leading man. Kate Beckinsale is a talented and versatile actress, who is stunningly beautiful. Well, 'Van Helsing' is all of that, and possibly has the most monsters per capita, than any movie in recent memory. These are not exactly 'props'. Sommers' movie not only opens in black and white; it also dense packs Dr. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). And there are more monsters to come including, the Werewolf, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Fortunately, Director Sommers ends the movie well in the last 45 minutes or so, melding the story together after a very unfocused and chaotic start. Credit Jackman and Breckensale for keeping our attention amidst the chaos. They are very attractive actors, who also have a natural chemistry. 'Van Helsing' ends up being a wild fun ride. Perhaps the best thing about Van Helsing is Hugh Jackman. He has a commanding presence, a great voice, and is totally charismatic. It also seems that this younger vampire hunter Van Helsing, the nemesis of Dracula, has been reinvented for Jackman. He is similar to X-Men's Logan, who has a mysterious past and no memory of it. Also it seems that this Van Helsing is much like a James Bond for the Vatican-- James Bond may be the next role in Jackman's near future. Anyway, Van Helsing is off to Transylvania with cool weapons invented by sidekick Carl (the Vatican's 'Q') to vanquish the evil Count Dracula. There they join forces with the warrior Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). The Valerious family has sworn vengeance on Dracula over the centuries. In an intriguing twist, it turns out that Dracula holds the key to Van Helsing's past. Then the story becomes extremely convoluted. Jekyll and Hyde are thrown in for no reason. Dracula requires Frankenstein's monster to ensure his legacy. Van Helsing must stop Dracula before he himself is turned to a Werewolf. This really would give something away if the story were more coherent, but it is not. The special effects in Van Helsing are state-of-the-art; however, the writing is not. Sommers does recover at the end-- it ends satisfyingly. Apparently, Van Helsing has a presold sequel. Perhaps, that will be more story and character driven, and the role expanded deserving of Jackman's talents. Jackman is good here regardless. He plays Van Helsing as darkly heroic, romantic, and intense. He also displays a sense of humor. Kate Beckinsale is strong and charming as Van Helsing's partner and love interest. They are a great looking couple, and that does not hurt the movie. 'Van Helsing' is silly fun, though it is frustrating to watch at times. It has enough star power from Jackman and Beckinsale, to engage and entertain for a couple of hours. A few less monsters and a cohesive story may have made a big difference.",7,1,2,10 May 2004
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Broken Hero Rises
","Director David Fincher's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is amazing. Rooney Mara is awesome as the Girl with the tattoo. She is a star. Mara inhabits Stieg Larsson's anti-hero hero Lisbeth Salander. 'The Girls with the Dragon Tattoo' is one of the best movies of the year. My bud Neil cautioned me that the movie is 2 hours and 40 minutes, and slow in the beginning—to set up the context, and worth it. Daniel Craig is unrecognizably physically vulnerable and compelling as Mikael. I think Craig is the most threatening physical presence as James Bond; this is distinct contrast. He plays the tarnished writer seeking redemption, researching a 40 year-old murder of the cryptically dysfunctional Vanger family. Jeff Cronenweth's striking cinematography captures the existential bleakness. Trent Reznor's innovative score lyrically balances the foreboding narrative.Fincher gravitates toward the darker lurid human crevices. I squirmed watching his shockingly explicit sodomy scene. This derives from the source material. From one point of view, the pivotal character arc for Lisbeth forges familiar rage and calculated retribution. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' gleans on the surface unsavory—serial murder, and the aftermath of physical and sexual abuse. I was initially puzzled by Fincher's remake of movies based on Larsson's novels which were acclaimed. Fincher triumphs and his vision warranted. He exquisitely underlies the virtue of humanity amidst its brutal inhumanity.Set in the austere winter of Stockholm, Lisbeth is the tortured Goth savant researcher on retainer to an international security firm. Mara with Lisbeth's facial and body piercings, tattoos, and spiked black hair is not your typical corporate researcher. She is the genius biker computer hacker with both photographic and auditory memory. Fincher has subtle reveal as Lisbeth memorizes the door security code as she strolls by an apartment.Fincher, Mara and Steven Zaillian's screenplay hint at the haunting possible abuse that shrouds Lisbeth's past—she suppresses great fear and anger displaying compartmentalized focus. In a glimpse into her rage, Lisbeth brutally beats a robber with her kickboxing skills. I have been watching a lot of Dr. Drew. Apparently, a ward of the state, Lisbeth is a loner spending her time eating micro-waved cup noodles, while immersed in her cyber research tasks. One of those subjects was Mikael (Craig). Though apparent recluse, Lisbeth seeks out both men and women as lovers. Mara is magnetic. Lisbeth had a beloved guardian, who suffered a stroke. Her current guardian is creepy attorney Bjurman (Yorick van Wageningen), who leverages appalling favors from Lisbeth to access her family money.Mikael Blomkvist (Craig) is the disgraced financial journalist losing a libel case and his fortune to businessman Wennerstrom (slick charming Ulf Friberg). He is co-owner of Millennium magazine with his lover Erika Berger (strong Robin Wright)—both are married, to other partners. He has a grown daughter. Mikael resigns. Meanwhile, Frode (menacing Steven Berkoff), the family attorney for Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), patriarch of Vanger Industries, contacts Mikael with a curious offer. Plummer is brilliantly controlling and charismatic as the suffering Henrik. Every year he receives a pressed flower from anonymous sender. His niece Harriet had always sent him this gift; however, he believes she was murdered over 40 years ago when she vanished in 1966. She was 16 years old. Henrik wants Mikael to find the person, who murdered Harriet, who he believes is family. In return, he will pay handsomely and give Mikael critical information. Harriet's brother Martin (icy cool Stellan Skarsgard) is the smart and measured man, who is now CEO of Vanger Industries. Mikael lives in a cottage on the Vanger estate on Hedeby Island and operates under the guise of writing a Vanger biography. Mikael soon discovers the depth of the Vanger family dysfunction.Frode ironically connects Mikael with Lisbeth to further his research which is at an impasse. They know their own personal connection. Mikael says, 'I want you to help me catch a killer of women.' Their lives intersect and the twisted journey spirals down the dark path. Thankfully, there is light. Rooney Mara is powerful as the broken hero. Daniel Craig is amazing as the compassionate partner. Mara and Craig are such amazing actors, who capture fear, sadness, and surprise in their eyes. David Fincher tells the hero's story with graceful triumphs and muted losses. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is awesome.",10,2,6,10 January 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Fresh Virgin
","We first see our hero Andy (Steve Carell) waking up, and at attention (so to speak) in his tidy apartment. His 'crib' is populated by hermetically boxed action figures, Play Station Games, and a framed poster of '80's rock group 'Asia'. He cooks a healthy breakfast, dresses geeky, and rides a bicycle to work. Andy is a supply clerk at an electronics super-store somewhere in West Los Angeles. The guys at the store need a fourth for their ritual poker night after the store closes. The delivery guy, Cal (stoner funny Seth Rogen) suspects that Andy might be some closeted serial killer. He really does. However, the rest of his crew, David (Paul Rudd) and Jay (Romanny Malco), invite Andy. Andy accepts. In an inept technical story, Andy comes out. No, not gay. He is a 40 year-old virgin. But instead of ridicule, Jay (slick street funny man, Romany Malco) declares that his life's mission is getting Andy laid. David and Cal are also enrolled in his community project. This is what is so charming, hysterical, and unexpected about Writer/ Director Judd Apatow's 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin.' Along with star and co-writer, Steve Carell, 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' is absolutely raunchy and graphic funny, but it is never mean-spirited. Never. In fact, the movie has a sweet love story, and an off-beat sense of true friendship. Much like 'Wedding Crashers', 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' is a smart, absolutely funny R-rated comedy with the romantic foreground.The story by Apatow and Carell is clever, hysterical, surprising, all with a light touch. In an unexpected scene Andy asks the always together Jay, 'Do you think that I am good-looking?' Jay tells him, '...Yes.' The exchange is sincere. Yes, Andy is some sort of loser with the action figures, video games, and zero fashion sense. Well, at least initially. But with the good-souled and so very earnest Carell as Andy, we get that there is perhaps more to him. Perhaps, Andy gave up on sex and really on love a long time ago. Carell pulls off Andy as some sort of celibate hero, not so much pathetic, rather really a good guy. Like his co-workers, the audience has a genuine affection for Andy. So when his Viking-like boss Paula (an imposing funny sexy Leslie Mann) personally offers to make Andy a man, the effect is hysterical.There are hilarious bits involving speed-dating, porn, body waxing, and projectile vomiting. Eventually, Andy meets Trish (quirky and completely charming Catherine Keener). Trish is a 40-ish mother of three, who owns a 'sell it on E-Bay' business. She has an office across from the electronics store. Andy meets her when she comes in looking for a VCR. Yes, VCR. His crew is behind Andy, and he musters up the courage to ask Trish out on a date. It goes so well, that they agree not to have sex for 20 dates as they get to know each other. No, this is not a big deal for Andy. Managing the rest of his life is.'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' runs a little too long, so to speak. Perhaps, it's only short coming. It is predictable, though completely hilarious with a universally satisfying charm. Steve Carell as Andy has a geeky charisma, for what could have been a pathetic characterization. Carell instills a great humanity and vulnerability in Andy. Catherine Keener is an amazing surprise as Trish. She is smart, funny, and extremely sexy. She is so believable as a 40 something single Mom, running her business, raising her kids, and looking for love. The rest of the cast are outstanding. Paul Rudd has great presence as David, the heart-broken guy who waffles between new age man, and woman chaser. Romany Malco is so versatile as Jay. He is the ultra slick dude, who ends up being a true friend to Andy. Seth Rogen is hysterical as the guy's guy Cal. There is a lot more to Apatow and Carell's 'Virgin' than drop dead laughs. It's got a good story. Definitely see 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin'.",9,1,4,21 August 2005
Shrek Forever After," Shrek Gets It Right
","'Shrek Forever After' is actually a return to the engaging storytelling of the first and second movies. Granted the story by Josh Kalusner and Darren Lemke is a take on 'It's a Wonderful Life'—not entirely original. Shrek 4 is better than the last sequel and not a great as the first two movies. It is about falling in love all over again. So I was on board with that. Eddie Murphy is hysterical returning as Donkey. Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz also give their best in this clumsy sweet story. Director Mike Mitchell does a great job of capping the pop culture gags—some of the hip-hop Pied Piper jokes are inspired. Eddie Murphy is amazing with his renditions of retro classics.In 'Forever After' Shrek (Myers) has become disenchanted with domestic life and the tedious routine. Life is good—he has a loving wife and 3 beautiful ogre kids. However, Shrek flips out at the 1 year Birthday party for his kids. He misses the days when he was the feared ogre. Fiona (Diaz) tells Shrek, 'You have everything. You're the only one who doesn't see it.' Rashly Shrek signs a deal with Rumpelstiltskin (funny Walt Dohrn) where he trades a day in his life so that he can spend a day as the feared Ogre. However, the forfeit day is the day he was born.Shrek soon realizes what has happened. Fortunately, Donkey (Murphy), who doesn't know Shrek in this alternate universe, points out there is a loop hole. Shrek discovers that since he never rescued his beloved Fiona from the Dragon Castle, she rescued herself and has reinvented herself as the Valkyrie ogre leading the resistance against the tyranny of Rumpelstiltskin. Fiona has no idea who Shrek is. Can Shrek and Fiona fall in love all over again? There is a hysterical 'rock-um sock-um' robots fight scene with both. At the story arc Shrek confesses to Fiona that 'The best part of the day was that I got to fall in love with you all over again.' 'Shrek Forever After' gets it right in the end. And is really worth seeing.",8,3,5,4 June 2010
Collateral," They do this for a living-- Good for Us
","Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are electrifying in Michael Mann's powerful 'Collateral'. Director Mann brushes his canvas from a crisp, taut, and dark shockingly humorous screenplay by Stuart Beattie. Beattie has an acute ear for smart dialog, and dramatic twists. Michael Mann is a master storyteller, whose nocturnal Los Angeles is a visually stunning and enthralling character onto itself. 'Collateral' spans one night. Mann's narrative is lean, intense, and transforms into a eloquent character study that is unexpectedly poignant. Mann also evokes amazing performances from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise, playing against type, is powerful as Vincent. This is perhaps his best and most chilling performance. Mann and Beattie casually open 'Collateral' as a collision of fate. We observe Vincent (Cruise), who arrives in LAX. Cruise looks differently: grayed hair and beard, gaunt, and icy cold. Max (Jamie Foxx) has been a cab driver in L.A. for 12 years. On this particular night he picks up a beautiful District Attorney, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith). Max tells Annie about his dreams of starting his own limousine service. She tells Max about her anxiety prior to her opening arguments on big court cases. Their talk is comfortable and flirtatious. Annie gives Max her business card. Before he can argue himself out of giving this gorgeous woman a call, Vincent gets in his cab. Vincent says he is in L.A. for a real estate deal, and has 5 stops to make. He will give Max $600 for the night, and a $100 bonus if he drives the entire night. Max reluctantly agrees. However, after a body crashes onto Max's cab, he realizes that he made a bad choice. Max says, 'You killed him?' Vincent replies unflinchingly, 'No, I shot him. The bullets and the fall killed him.' Yes, Vincent is a contract killer. Apparently, Vincent's 'real estate deal' involves terminating witnesses in a major drug cartel indictment. Max, himself may become the victim of Vincent's collateral damage. Jamie Foxx is an awesome actor. His Max is doing his best to survive, and keep his wits about him. Foxx is believable as a man thrust into a seemingly no-win situation. Max at the beginning is holding on for dear life, being that Vincent is a sociopath and expert killer. Foxx as Max actually grows stronger from this unusual partnership with Vincent. The fact that Max brings along Vincent when he visits his Mom is a masterful touch. The captivating scenes in the cab with Foxx and Cruise, just talking, demonstrate their magical chemistry. Tom Cruise is powerful. One must acknowledge the risk he took in playing a cold professional killer which is so against type. His choice to play Vincent as a charismatic, intelligent, and charming character just slightly off moral north is brilliant. He never overplays the villain. Instead his Vincent has all the symptoms of a hero, but skewed toward darkness. Cruise gives Vincent an air of nobility, shrouded in manic rationalization. He tells Max, the people that he kills are really criminals. Cruise slowly unveils Vincent's past as the movie progresses in such a natural manner. Killing is a business for Vincent-- there is nothing personal. Cruise defends the line where Vincent's behavior is never justified, only understood. As Vincent, Cruise is both credible and deadly.Vincent is a professional cold hearted killer, who is terrifying. Cruise intensely trained for the fighting sequences, and they are performed expertly. Vincent dispatches his victims with a controlled brutality, and great style. The 'hit' at the Asian nightclub is simply stunning. Tom Cruise's intensity and charisma are leveraged effectively in 'Collateral'.The final twist in 'Collateral' is effective. Michael Mann's action movie, character study works on so many levels. He pulls the audience in from the first frame, and we can't take a breath until the last. Jada Pinkett Smith is very strong and charming as Annie. She holds her own with Foxx and Cruise. Jamie Foxx is a great actor. Tom Cruise gives a commanding and mesmerizing performance. He deserves an Academy Award nomination for his work here. And 'Collateral' deserves to be seen.",10,0,1,16 August 2004
Dunkirk," Good, Not Great
","Writer and Director Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk' literally soars in the air; otherwise, pretty ordinary on both land and sea. Too bad. 'Dunkirk' is very good, not great. And I am a big fan of Nolan. 'Dunkirk' follows three interwoven stories about the evacuation of over 300,000 British and French troops from Dunkirk during World War II, prior to U.S. involvement. Civilian boats contributed in large part to this massive exodus back to England. 'Dunkirk' is the distinct visual masterpiece. The 70 mm format is amazing. Nolan's dialogue is minimalist and Hans Zimmer's provocative score essentially narrates this relentless tale of survival, bravery, and perseverance.Something seems amiss with 'Dunkirk'. 'Dunkirk' aspires as the great hero story. However, as much as the heroes compel, their stories become indistinguishable at times. Then again that may be Nolan's point that in war the hero survives. I don't know a lot of the actors in 'Dunkirk' aside from Tom Hardy. Fionn Whitehead as infantry soldier Tommy is strong. Mark Rylance as boat captain Mr. Dawson has marvelous gravitas. Tom Hardy as courageous fighter pilot Farrier is commanding. His performance and charisma are stymied by his confined presence in the cockpit of his Spitfire for the duration of the movie. Kenneth Branagh fares best as Commander Bolton, who distills the conscience and gravity for the responsibility of saving the lives of thousands of soldiers.All are very good, on the verge of great. Perhaps, part of the muted expectation is that this is history, and we kind of know how it ends. Though the message that ordinary people transform as extraordinary is not lost in Nolan's harrowing depiction. Soldiers line up on the white sand beach of Dunkirk under the gray sky, as they wait for ships to take them home. All the while, they must contend with Nazi bombers and fighters determined on their demise. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and Nolan brilliantly paint their existential treatise of war on the screen. 'Dunkirk' truly soars as Farrier and his pilots battle Nazi bombers and fighter craft in the skies. The drama and imagery are breathtaking. We experience both the expression of freedom and danger in every engagement. Hardy is powerful. The movie could have used more of him. And more of this imagery. Whitehead as Tommy captures the youthful innocence and idealism of the soldier. Tommy desperately wants to go home. Along with his fellow soldiers, he endures sinking ships and terrifying bombing attacks. Like the other soldiers, Tommy is a young man, virtually a boy with his entire life ahead. Many soldiers die in the aftermath. They will never fall in love, get married, or have a family. Nolan in the end reminds with uncompromising clarity that the cost of war is too high. War maybe hell. War is definitely sad.",8,3,8,24 July 2017
Bad Teacher," Pretty Good 'Bad Teacher'
","'Bad Teacher' is pretty good. In fact it is funny. The story by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg could have been more idiosyncratic, and less tangential. What they created has a certain style and flow. Amazingly, along with Director Jake Kasdan they ultimately make Cameron Diaz's totally unlikable Elizabeth humorously transform. No small feat. Cameron Diaz soars fearlessly as 'The Bad Teacher' with graceful comedic timing. 'Bad Teacher' surprisingly works, because she plays the character straight up, and her epiphany is deserved.In 'Bad Teacher' Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey at JAMS—a middle school in Chicago. Diaz looks vibrant and stunningly fit. Her Halsey is a vapid gold digger biding her time until she marries her rich fiancé. This unravels when her fiancé's mother punctuates that Elizabeth only loves him for his money. Consequently, Elizabeth is forced to return to her job after summer break. As fate would have it, Scott Delecorte (brilliantly nerdy Justin Timberlake, also Diaz's former flame) is the new substitute teacher. Scott is the heir to the Delecorte Family watch fortune. Elizabeth finds her rival in fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (dangerously perky Lucy Punch). Intense Amy is alarmingly upbeat, and seems to have suffered a previous meltdown. Scott's apparent physical attraction to his former girlfriend, prompts Elizabeth to get surgical breast enhancement. There is a hysterical scene with Diaz trying out a patient's boob job.However, the procedure runs about $10,000—even with affordable financing. At the same time, Elizabeth squashes the charms of regular poor guy gym teacher Russell (laid back funny Jason Segal). How does one choose to become a gym teacher anyway? After an embarrassingly cheesy school car wash/ wet t-shirt contest gag with Diaz in cutoff shorts and soaking wet, she realizes the solution to her boob job fund. The teacher at JAMS with the highest average standardized test scores gets a $5700 bonus. So instead of showing videos in class, being either doped out or recovering from a hangover, Elizabeth becomes drill sergeant English teacher. There is a hysterical scene when she slams basketballs off student's heads for incorrect answers. Or when she is totally frustrated by the inept practice test results, she screams that is why the Japanese students beat their asses—however, in less delicate euphemism. Then the story takes a weirder turn even for itself.At the predictable arc during a field trip gone nearly awry, Elizabeth has a conversation with geeky Garrett (sweet hearted Matthew J. Evans), who springs nonlinear when he is rejected by the love of his life too cool for school Chase (good Kathryn Newton). Diaz tells him that Chase will never like him, because he is not cool. She was Chase once, and likely still is. Garrett points out that the kid Chase likes is stupid. Her Elizabeth admits, 'He's a moron.' Elizabeth tells Garrett that he is sensitive, and for now cool rules. His time will come in college. Diaz is brilliantly funny and insightful. Russell (Segal) wryly says, 'That's a nice thing you did for him.' There is cute punch line; however, Diaz and Segal level out the often crass context, with a reassuring yet unsentimental human touch. Even at our most self centric, we will protect those put upon.The universe has a way of balancing out in 'Bad Teacher'. 'Bad Teacher' is not perfect. It is funny and worth your patience. Diaz, Punch, Segal, and Timberlake play together hilariously well. Cameron's boldness really makes it work. 'Bad Teacher' is really pretty good, all things considered.",8,8,15,12 July 2011
The Fast and the Furious," Speed Rush
","Rob Cohen's 'Fast and Furious' is just that: an adrenaline and speed rush, very derivative, not original, though effective overall. Cohen accomplishes this with the given material, by using intensity, pacing, hard driving music, and casting high power, young actors in the movie, in particular Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, and Rick Yune. F&F is the kind of movie that may not be memorable for it's dramatic content and narrative style, rather as a breakthrough vehicle for its stars. On that basis, the movie has merit. Director Cohen definitely performs some of the most amazing car sequences on screen. The driving stunts rule.Brian (Walker) is an undercover cop investigating a ring of high speed car thieves. While undercover Brian befriends Dom Toretto (Diesel), a powerful street racer with a dark past, who has a sense of honor and loyalty. Dom's rival is a cold blooded leader of an Asian gang, Johnny Tran (Yune). All movie leads shine. Vin Diesel has a commanding physical screen presence. He powers Dom's character with an edge and sense of danger. Diesel will be a huge action star-- he's got the physique and is a good actor. Walker has the leading man good-looks, and attitude. He is well matched as Diesel's foil. He does well with the trite undercover cop storyline of falling in love with the suspect's (Dom's) sister. Rick Yune gives Johnny Tran a dangerous air-- a man of few words and an icy killer. It's always encouraging when a movie has both strong and charismatic heroes and villains. It is all about being cool and looking good-- and 'Fast and Furious' does this with style and without significance. That is a good thing...",8,1,1,25 June 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Ocean's Cool
","Steven Soderbergh's 'Ocean's Eleven' epitomizes cool with a classy ensemble cast, sharp dialog, romance, and robbery. Leading the pack is George Clooney as Danny Ocean who as the movie begins is just released from prison. Being the reformed man that he is, Ocean quickly devises a scheme to rob the 3 biggest casinos in Las Vegas-- the Bellagio, the MGM Grand, and the Mirage.All of them are owned by Terry Benedict played with icy ruthlessness by Andy Garcia. Also Terry is now with Tess Ocean, Danny's ex-wife. Danny seeks out his point man, gambler, Rusty Ryan (Brad Piit). Rusty and Danny get a financier and begin assembling Ocean's 11. It soon becomes evident to Rusty (Pitt): Is this about the $160 million or Tess? If it were only about the money, 'Ocean's Eleven' would be an exercise. It is not. George Clooney is a movie star. His Danny Ocean is slick, smart, and a charmer with an underlying substance-- he's a romantic. Brad Pitt is also at his best as Rusty. Pitt exudes the charisma and cool, and he is also very funny. There is hilarious running gag where Pitt is eating something in almost every scene. Clooney and Pitt together nail the crisp and very lean dialog. Julia Roberts is particularly sullen here which is called for in the role, surprisingly out of character for her. The great supporting cast includes Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, and Carl Reiner, who all have their moments to shine. Soderbergh orchestrates the movie cohesively with great style. I saw a Barbara Walters interview with the cast of 'Oceans Eleven' where Clooney said that Steven was not making a statement movie with 'Ocean's'. He is correct. What Soderbergh made is a fun and entertaining movie with a very talented cast.",9,0,0,21 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Looks great and is...
","'Pearl Harbor' is a great movie-- I was surprised.  Even at 3 hours I didn't have to bring a pillow... though I didn't drink anything during.  PH did not seem like 3 hours.  Randall Wallace's story is effective and engaging even with parts of it being predictable-- aside from the actual bombing of PH. Michael Bay masters the technical aspects of the movie and does well with the human element.  The story revolving around best friends Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) being love with the same woman, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale)is simple and it works.  Ben Affleck is a great leading man.  Josh Hartnett is awesome-- he is going to be a huge star.  Rafe and Danny are like brothers, and their bond is both touching and inspiring.  This keeps the movie grounded.  Beckinsale has a weaker role (more of a plot device), and does well by it.  It's also fabulous to see Alec Baldwin in a strong performance as Col. Doolittle.Michael Bay and Randall Wallace do a fabulous job of telling a story of courage, loss, and the rites of passage for a nation.  Kenneth Turan of the LA Times described 'Pearl Harbor' as a parable of the loss of innocence for a nation.  I believe that he is accurate.  'Pearl Harbor' is not William Wordsworth... What it does very well is convey a tremendous sense of loss (the cost of war) and the triumph of the human spirit.  It's great to see a big budget Hollywood movie that  looks great, and still remembers what moves, touches, and inspires.  And that is NOT just 'great sounding bulls**t'.",8,0,0,29 May 2001
Tropic Thunder," Hysterical Tropic Thunder
","Brilliant Robert Downey Jr. as 6 time Academy Award Winner Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, who has physically altered himself to play African American character Linc, says, 'I don't read the script. The script reads me!' Confused fellow actor Kevin Sandusky (excellent Jay Baruchel) exclaims, 'What do you mean?' Writer and Director Ben Stiller's 'Tropic Thunder' is absolutely hysterical, and is the funniest movie of the year. With the screenplay by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen, from the story by Stiller and Theroux, 'Tropic Thunder' is among the funniest and clever movies ever made. The work alone by Robert Downey Jr. as acclaimed actor Kirk Lazarus and the almost indistinguishable Tom Cruise are beyond praise and totally off the hook. There is a scene where Downey as Australian Lazarus, playing a Black man, is disguised as a Vietnamese speaking Mandarin. No wonder even Lazarus is confused saying: 'I know who I am! I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude!' No more shall be revealed about Cruise's role. Needless to say it is comic genius.Director Ben Stiller generates amazing performances from his lead actors including himself, Jack Black, Downey, Brandon T. Jackson, and Nick Nolte. But the surprises are the big name supporting actors like Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's agent Rick Peck and of course Tom Cruise. 'Tropic Thunder' will offend virtually everyone, and every group of people. Stiller and crew have written bold biting comedy blind to elements of conventional taste that mercilessly mocks the egos at play in the world of celebrity and entertainment.'Tropic Thunder' is about a movie within a moviewell, for the most part. In 'Tropic Thunder' overwhelmed movie director Damien Cockburn (wonderfully scattered Steve Coogan) is charged with making the Vietnam War picture 'Tropic Thunder'. 'Tropic Thunder' is based on the book by wounded Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (completely out there Nick Nolte). Damien (Coogan) is charged with the nearly impossible task of filming this movie with a cast of 'prima donnas'. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is the washed up action star seeking to revive his plummeting career. Kirk Lazarus (Downey) is the Oscar Winner Actor, who remains in character until he does the narration for the DVD release. Lazarus also underwent a controversial procedure to look like the African American sergeant he plays in the movie. Rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) is the Chris Ludicrous-like character crossing over from hip-hop to acting. Jeff Portnoy (crazed and funny Jack Black) is the comedic star, whose claims to fame are movies about flatulent characters. Portnoy is also a big time coke addict. Kevin Sandusky (geeky funny Jay Baruchel) is the young actor with his big break. After 4 days of shooting 'Tropic Thunder' is something like $100 million dollars over budget according to 'E!' Under mounting pressure from his producer, Damien (Coogan) follows the whacked out recommendation from Tayback (Nolte). Damien basically high jacks his actors into the jungles of Vietnam to film his greatest war movie 'guerilla style'. Predictably something goes very wrong. What follows is hilarious comic mayhem. Ben Stiller has the toughest role, because his Tugg is a complete idiot. To his credit he doesn't get smarter. It is only through Stiller's charm and support by Downey, does Tugg become sympathetic.The controversy surrounding the characterization of the mentally disabled or handicapped, is warrantedI suspect. The inappropriate vernacular is used. However, in context the target is really the skewering of narcissistic method acting and actors. In the exchange Lazarus (Downey) advises Speedman (Stiller), 'Never go full' This is a well written piece about Oscar politics and what lands with an audience involving Hoffman, Hanks, Sellers, and Penn. The arc for this narrative thread is not smug or cruel. We do live in interesting times.Robert Downey Jr. is an amazing talent. As Kirk Lazarus, Downey demonstrates that he can do virtually anything on screen and just kill. Even as out there as his character Lazarus; he can generate insight whether it is his conversation about 'Simple Jack' with Stiller or when he says to Jackson's Alpa Chino, 'We cool?' Downey enrolls an authentic presence in the most warped contexts. Stiller grounds his Speedman in compassionate stupid. As director Stiller delivers his talented cast on deadly comic ground. 'Tropic Thunder' is smart, offensive, and will make you laugh out loud.",10,3,6,18 August 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," On the Journey Style Rules
","In life it is all about the journey. 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is about the journey, and then some. Director and Writer Edgar Wright creates a visually exciting approximation of life in this slacker gamer world where Michael Cera is avatar Scott Pilgrim. The screenplay by Wright and Michael Bacall is based on the graphic novel by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Being neither familiar with the source material, nor the twenty-something gamer demographic 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' occurs as a familiar Disneyland ride jacked on ecstasy and steroids. Wright creates TV homage from the campy 1960's 'Batman' with 'Pow!' to the more contemporary 'Seinfeld'. Wright generates one of the most visually inventive movies—though not along the lines of Chris Nolan's 'Inception'. However, here style over substance is not necessarily a good thing. 'Scott Pilgrim' is a video game fable with our hero Scott played by Michael Cera at his dweebish best. Scott is the 22 year-old slacker bass player for his band Sex Bo-bomb. He lives with his charming gay roommate Wallace (funny Kieran Culkin). He is rebounding from a break up with his rock siren girlfriend Envy Adams (devilish diva Brie Larson). He is dating 17 year-old high school girl Knives Chau (bubbly Ellen Wong). In the midst of a band competition for a record contract, Scott sees the girl of his dreams in his dreams—Ramona Flowers (fiery and beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Later Scott sees Ramona at a party, and realizes that she is the One. However, before Scott can date or make out with Ramona he must defeat, as in to the death, her 7 Evil Ex's. Note there is a reason why it is not the 7 Evil Ex-Boyfriends. Do the math. Needless to say, both high jinx and chaos ensue. Michael Cera is still playing the same freaking character—as he does in all his movies. However, here the good hearted nerd gets to kick ass in martial arts style. The saving grace is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona. Winstead has a self aware charm, and stunning screen presence. She is going to be a star. Chris Evans as egomaniac action star/ skateboarder Lucas Lee, also an Evil Ex, is hysterical. Jason Schwartzman is funny in small doses, but is light years beyond annoying as record producer Gideon Gordon Graves—also a Ramona Ex. 'Scott Pilgrim' is an eclectic narrative kluge. The fact that 22 year-old Scott is dating 17 year-old minor Knives, even if they aren't having sex, is very creepy. What is creepier, the screenwriters proceed as business as usual here. Perhaps, statutory rape laws are different in Toronto? The kung fu fight choreography is flashy and comical—the intended effect. Being a martial arts snob, I enjoyed the fight choreography of 'The Expendables' way more. 'Scott Pilgrim' runs about 20 minutes too long, with about 3 too many Ex's, but fortunately ends right. Beneath all the pop culture glitz and indulgent idiosyncrasy 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is romantic comedy after all. Romantic comedy is hard to do. I think 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' often loses track of this thread along the journey.",7,5,22,16 August 2010
Enchanted," The Possibility of Happily Ever After
","While scarfing down some mushroom chicken and having a conversation with 3 and half year-old Jack and his dad Vince before seeing Disney's 'Enchanted', excited Jack told me that 'Enchanted' has a princess, a prince, and an evil stepmother that transforms into a dragon. Well, before finishing lunch I was thoroughly enrolled in 'Enchanted'. 'Enchanted' is all about the possibility of happily ever after. Director Kevin Lima and Writer Bill Kelly tell an enchanting fairy tale that still resonates in this often time cynical world. Why not the possibility of happily ever after? Amy Adams emerges as a bright star in the role of Giselle, the fairy tale princess trapped in the real world of Manhattan, New York. Lima and Kelly seamlessly transition from the animated fairy tale world to New York City with measured disbelief. But then again, we kind of know what we are getting into when seeing this movie. 'Enchanted' is a musical albeit tongue-in-cheek at times. The songs and music by Alan Menkin ('Beauty and the Beast') and Stephen Schwartz ('Wicked') are exquisite and classic homage to Disney films past. There is the spectacular musical number in Central Park with Adams singing as Giselle. She asks divorce attorney Robert (Patrick Dempsey), how does he know that he loves his fiancée Nancy (Idina Menzel), then bursts out into song.What really entranced me was the simple story. When Giselle asks Robert about true love, he argues, 'It's complicated' There is a surprisingly touching scene in the park when Giselle tells Robert, 'I wish you find every happiness in the world.' Amy Adams is wonderfully earnest and genuine as Giselle. 'Enchanted' is both a hysterical twist and homage to the fairy tale. Although at times blatantly cheesy, 'Enchanted' is all about wonder and heart. Patrick Dempsey is great. He brilliantly plays the straight man in this collapsing of real and fairy tale worlds. He and Adams have amazing chemistry which is the foundation of 'Enchanted'.'Enchanted' begins in the fairy tale world of Andalasia where Giselle awaits her true love. Until then she spends most of her days singing with the animals of the forest. Her true love would be Prince Edward (hysterically pompous James Marsden), who spends most of his days conquering the ogres of the land. This is the diabolically constructed strategy of Edward's wicked stepmother Queen Narissa (evilly camp Susan Sarandon) to keep him from marrying Giselle; thus, replacing herself from the royal throne. However, Giselle and Edward are fated to marry. On their wedding day Narissa, disguised as an old woman, banishes Giselle to the world of 'no happily ever after'New York City. Fortunately Edward's loyal chipmunk Pip clues in the Prince of this conspiracy. Edward then follows his beloved Giselle.Patrick Dempsey plays Robert, a single father and divorce attorney. Robert is at somewhat of a cross roads in his life. Though apparently good at what he does, he is unfulfilled. He is raising his daughter Morgan (cute Rachel Covey) by himself, and about to marry his fiancée Nancy (hilariously uptight Idina Menzel). And we all know that she is not the one. As fate would have it Robert and Morgan take in Giselle, who occurs as total nut job. Being more perceptive of these sort of things Morgan tells her Dad, 'I think she is a real princess.' Robert soon wonders whether he is going insane or that Giselle is really who she says. All the while, Robert wonders if he has found his true love in Giselle. Meanwhile, Queen Narissa journeys to New York with a poison apple for Giselle.It's good versus evil with a surprising heroic twist. The other surprise in 'Enchanted' is the innate good in its characters. Well, except for Sarandon's Queen. However, Sarandon brilliantly balances the menace and camp for hysterical effect. James Marsden infuses a playful compassion in Edward. Patrick Dempsey embodies Robert's nobility. Amy Adams's bright spirit also radiates courage and character as Giselle. 'Enchanted' celebrates the possibility of happily ever after in a very entertaining and special movie.",10,5,7,3 December 2007
Avengers: Endgame," The Legacy in 'Endgame'
","Robert Downey Jr.'s gaunt Tony Stark records his message to his beloved Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, aboard the disabled spaceship last seen in 'Avengers: Infinity War', 'Part of the journey is the end...' After 11 years of Marvel movies, Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's 'Avengers: Endgame' signifies the end of the journey with laughter and surprising poignancy. At one point holdout Avengers leader Natasha (former assassin Black Widow), played by beautiful soulful Scarlett Johansson, refers to the Avengers as 'family'. That resonates for us, too. For the last 11 years these screen Heroes have become family. We care what becomes of them. Do they find peace? Do they discover love?'Endgame' screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely patiently crescendo to the showdown with seemingly omnipotent galactic villain Thanos, motion captured by malevolently measured Josh Brolin, whom defeated the Avengers, by wiping out half of all life in the universe using the Infinity Gauntlet possessing all 6 Infinity Stones. The climactic battle is visually astounding, and oh so costly. Yet, what inspires most about 'Endgame' is family and heart.Most of 'Endgame' takes place 5 years after Titan's Warrior Thanos decimated half the population of the universe, including about half of the Avengers. Here less is actually more. Where as in 'Avengers: Infinity War', way too many Superheroes resulted in the kluged narrative, focusing on the surviving Heroes: Chris Evans's Captain America (Steve Rogers), Robert's Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, displaced God of Thunder, empowers the story. Brie Larson's all-powerful Captain Marvel charismatically emerges as the new Avenger. Too bad the Russo's couldn't leverage more for Brie. Then again, that might have been narrative saturation.Where 'Infinity War' was so dour and so self-absorbed, 'Endgame' has a wicked sense of humor. Mark Ruffalo's glasses wearing civilized green giant Hulk taking selfies with adoring teen fans is hysterical. Critical to restoring their fallen Heroes in Thanos's aftermath, the surviving Avengers utilize time travel in hopes of preventing Thanos from possessing all Infinity Stones. In the hilarious expository exchange regarding the effects of changing past and future events: 'This is not 'Back to the Future'.' No, it's not. And I busted out laughing.The human narrative touches in 'Endgame'. The distinct strength of the Marvel Universe Movies are its Actors. Travelling back to 1970, Robert's Tony Stark meets his estranged Father Howard, the genius engineer, played by earnest John Slattery. Howard has no idea that he's talking to his future son, because his wife is about to give birth. Robert's authentic compassion moves. Tony hugs Howard, who expressed doubt about being a good Father, saying, 'It'll work out.' Then you realize that was the only time the two had ever hugged. On that same trip back, Chris Evans's Steve wistfully gazes at Peggy Carter, played by captivating Hayley Atwell. Peggy is the forsaken love of Cap's life.Chris Hemsworth's Thor travels back to the Norse legendary Asgard to retrieve an Infinity Stone. He encounters his mortal Mother Frigga, the powerful sorceress played by beautiful strong Rene Russo, on the day she's to die. In a subdued joke, rotund Thor has seen better days, since failing to dispatch Thanos in 'Infinity War'. His loving Mom tells her son that she knows that he's suffered. Looking into his eyes Frigga says, 'The measure of the Hero is being true to yourself.' Amen.Really, 'Endgame' is awesome, because of heart. In that Karen Gillan is understated power as the mostly machine Nebula, daughter of Thanos. Her Father had contested her against sister Gamora, played by brilliantly strong Zoe Saldana, for his love. Tortured and devalued Nebula, becomes ravaged with vengeance upon her Father. Yet, Karen makes us believe that Nebula's soul is worth salvation.Yeah, at 3 hours and 1 minutes 'Endgame' is the restroom challenge. I kid, well sort of. Despite all that, I loved 'Avengers: Endgame'. It's the poignant, whimsical end of the journey. At least for me, the Avengers are my fictional Hero family. Like the characters on the wide screen, we all experience suffering, profound loss, joy, and triumph. In life, like Chris's Cap says, 'Take your baby steps... Move forward.' I for one shall remember the Avengers in my heart.",10,149,283,29 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," Powerful Solace
","Daniel Craig may be the screen's most powerful and dangerous Bond. He embodies a ferocious focus and intensity as Agent 007. I had read in a 'Playboy' interview that Craig got physically bigger so that Bond would look like he could kill anyone. Director Marc Forster's 'Quantum of Solace' is the decidedly dark and brutal tale of vengeance and solace. Under his direction the action is visually spectacular, visceral, and menacing. In the opening Bond (Craig) precariously navigates through a high speed chase on a coastal road in Italy. Subsequently, Bond battles traitor Mitchell (strong Glenn Foster) after both breathtakingly crash though a church glass ceiling. All the fighting has martial arts flairkick-boxing and aikido. The gun play is deadly and precise. Daniel Craig's Bond is even more singular in purpose than 'Casino Royale'. This is an unexpected turn with Marc Forster at the helm. Forster among other films directed 'Finding Neverland'. Forster along with Academy Award Winner Paul Haggis ('Crash' and 'Million Dollar Baby'), and co-writers Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade create the darker Bond and shed insight into the man he eventually becomes. To that end Daniel Craig is amazingly powerful.'Quantum of Solace' resumes where 'Casino Royale' ended. Seems that Mr. White (calmly evil Jesper Christensen), the man responsible for Vesper's death, is part of a clandestine global organization Quantum. Vesper was the love of James's life. Consequently, Bond seeks revenge on the man ultimately responsible for Vesper's deaththat would be entrepreneur ecologist Dominic Greene (shifty Mathieu Amalric). In his mission seemingly governed by inconsolable rage Bond leaves an aftermath of death and destruction. Bond's concerned mentor M (the strong and amazing Judi Dench) warns Bond, 'When you can't tell your friends from your enemies, it's time to go.' Bond reminds M, 'You don't have to worry about me.' Fearing that James may turn rogue, M pulls the network from Bond, leaving him an island. As his last resort, Bond seeks out Mathis (world weary Giancarlo Gianni), the man who betrayed him in 'Casino Royale'. Mathis discerns Bond's wounded soul. He tells him that Vesper loved him. Bond replies, 'Until the moment she betrayed me.' Craig is brilliant in masking Bond's pain in his focused rage. Ultimately, whatever happens, he has to let it go.Bond aligns with an unlikely partner in vengeancethe beautiful Russian Camille (strong and stunning Olga Kurylenko). Camille had become Greene's lover so that she can kill his business partner General Medrano (arrogant and smug Joaquin Cosio). Camille bares the physical scars and the emotional anguish of the General's horrific acts upon her family. It is unclear exactly what Quantum has to do with all this, but Greene's motives are anything but altruistic.Kurylenko is surprising. As Camille she is not all what she seems. She is smart and embodies a warrior's spirit. Here Forster and Haggis poignantly comment on the futility and cost of vengeance. In a quiet moment Camille asks James if he had killed the man responsible for the death of the woman he loved. James says, 'No, not yet.' Camille confesses, 'Tell me when you do I'd like to know how it feels.' In middle of the Bolivian desert before both embark on their missions of vengeance Bond instructs Camille, 'This kill is personal make it count' Cold harsh words. The paradox is that dispassionate vengeance is always personal, and it only costs the exacter. The understated partnership of Craig and Kurylenko is powerful in 'Quantum of Solace'. Forster orchestrates some of the most spectacular roof top chases, deadly fight scenes, and electrifying aerial sequences. Amidst it all Craig and Kurylenko generate the emotional resonance. And in the end we don't get some flip line, rather an insight into the part of himself that Bond forfeits to become 007.If there is one weakness, it is the villain Greene. As played by Amalric, he is not a formidable rival to Craig's Bond. Even Kurylenko is stronger. Granted Craig's Bond is perhaps the screen's most forceful. However, this was also the case in 'Casino Royale'. Perhaps, in the next Bond, Haggis creates a villain equal in persona to Craig's Bond.'Quantum of Solace' is perhaps the best Bond movie. It is not perfect. However, it is hard edged and relentless, delivering a resounding catharsis. Daniel Craig is amazing. Olga Kurylenko is nearly his equal. 'Quantum of Solace' is one of the year's most satisfying movies.",9,3,9,15 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Great, but what gives?
","At the conclusion of 'No Country for Old Men' I thought the Coen Brothers gave me and the audience 'the finger'. After 2 hours of mesmerizing storytelling with the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins, the movie endswithout a discernible third act. I will cop to being obtuse. Instead of giving 'the finger' back, I acknowledge the masterpiece at work with Writers and Directors Ethan and Joel Coen. The performances are astounding from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem. Bardem as the sociopath killer Anton Chigurh is powerful, and deserves to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.'No Country for Old Men' on the surface glorifies sociopath professional killer Chigurh (Bardem) in his mission to retrieve $2 millionat least on the surface. The Coen Brothers never manufacture any insight into the ruthless and nearly indestructible Chigurh. Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff Ed Bell's resolution is poignant in keeping with the title, and hinting a possible future, but is completely out of context. Even if the Coens intend this as a great existential treatise, it is overly indulgent and does not work. There is no compelling catharsis to 'No Country for Old Men'. Having a catharsis about either the good or evil in men would have been welcome. Here one just seems missing. Even reflecting upon the ending I kept expecting to see Pam Ewing seeing Bobby in the shower on that infamous episode of 'Dallas'. What happened here? I get that exploration into human darkness and ambiguous endings equate to movie gravitas. However, here I wonder how much of this is the Directors' arrogance? Set in 1980, 'No Country for Old Men' opens multi-textured. On a deer hunting trip Lewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers a massacre in the middle of nowhere. The scene is an apparent drug deal gone awry: murdered bodies everywhere, a shipment of heroin, and $2 million. Chigurh brutally escapes local sheriffs' custody and begins a merciless killing rampage. The cold blooded Chigurh is singular in focus, and chillingly displays mastery at what he does. Lewelyn returns to his trailer home and wife Carla Jean (good Kelly Macdonald). Lewelyn does not know what to do next, but he knows that as long as he has the money both he and Carla Jean are in grave danger. Meanwhile in the city, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) meets with a mysterious man who wants him to locate Chigurh and the money. Carson confirms that Chigurh is a very bad man. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell narrates the story's opening. His voice is tired and resigned, saying 'I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious.' Jones embodies a battle worn weariness, and folksy common sense in Ed Tom. Soon all story threads converge, and Ed Tom must bring to justice the murderous Chigurh.The Coen brothers chillingly compel in their story of greed, murder, and betrayal. This certainly is no place for old men, who have grown weary of the evil that men can do and no longer have the resolve to do what is necessary. That may be simple speak; however, it may be appropriate for this tale. Given all the passionate and brilliant work, I think the Coens really disappoint in the end. Even if this is their existential masterpiece where both good and evil men survive in the world or that life really means nothing in a profound sense, at least complete a Third Act of a story. After investing 2 hours watching brilliant storytelling, at least have the humility to conclude the story in some recognizable manner.",9,4,10,10 February 2008
Toy Story 4," 'Toy Story 4' is Something Very Special
","In Pixar's beloved narrative mythology of the 'Toy Story' movies, the toys come to life and speak, only when no one including children is present. Screen writers Andrew Stanton and Stephany Folsom, and story writers John Lassiter, Andrew, and Director Josh Cooley bring Disney's animated 'Toy Story 4' to life once more.Tom Hanks voices stalwart Cowboy doll Woody, who 'raised' grown up Andy. Tim Allen voices bold spaceman toy Buzz Lightyear, the reluctant best friend to Woody. Woody now belongs to kindergartner Bonnie, voiced by innocent Madeline McGraw. Apparently, Woody has been replaced by self-constructed Forky, voiced by youthfully naïve Tony Hale. By the way, Forky is the spork (hybrid spoon and fork) rescued from the trash.Wide-eyed Woody regretfully confesses to doll Little Bo Beep, played by spirited Annie Potts, about losing Andy and now Bonnie, 'I don't have anything else...' Andy loved Woody, then eventually moved on to college. Bonnie loved Woody. Now she's moving on to school, with Forky.Recall Taylor Hackford's 'An Officer and a Gentlemen', where Louis Gossett's Sgt. Foley coerces Richard Gere's Zack Mayo to quit the officers' training program. Zack tearfully yells, 'I got no where else to go... I got nothing else.'Director Josh's 'Toy Story 4' is Woody's transformational reckoning, albeit for a toy. Yet, the narrative wonderfully underlies the unique duplicity of 'Toy Story'. Children love their favorite toys with all their hearts. In a sense, the toys care for them. In 'Toy Story 4' Woody loves Andy and Bonnie back. Life moves on. Eventually, children shall move on to their next love, be it another toy or new friends.In one sense, the toys - Woody and Buzz are much like parents on the journey as their children transform into adults. I'm not a parent, yet I see that as our affinity to 'Toy Story 4'. What happens when your love is replaced? Rather, what happens when the ones you love so dear move on? Maybe, we too continue to find our next love?In 'Toy Story 4' Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the Toy Band are back together, now with little girl Bonnie. The first 20 minutes occurred as nearly perfunctory storytelling with Bonnie and her Mom and Dad voiced by, solid Lori Alan and Jay Hernandez, taking a family road trip. No doubt, high jinx awaits. Yet, what unfolds is far from predictable, perhaps even poignant.Woody reunites with Bo Peep (who goes by Bo). Woody has always been in love with Bo. They separated 9 years ago, when Woody chose to stay back to look after Andy. Subsequently, Bo became a 'lost toy' - the childless toy.In the disturbingly bizarre narrative reveal, the broken doll Gabby Gabby, voiced by brazenly vulnerable Christina Hendricks, generates surprising gravitas. Her 'voice box' unlike pull string Woody, no longer works. Gabby Gabby resides in an antique toy shop, accompanied by her eerie ventriloquist doll squad. These dolls are extremely creepy. Nearly distracting. Really.Yet, on the upside we observe Gabby Gabby's incomplete toy life. Christina brilliantly nuances Gabby such that we get a sense of what she wants most: To be loved. That's the human eloquence of 'Toy Story 4': We all deserve to be loved.The Pixar crew's animation in 'Toy Story 4' astounds from the emergence of Forky or the Toys tampering with the accelerator pedals on the speeding family rental van. Comic relief arises in the carnival stuffed animals, Ducky and Bunny voiced by hysterical Keegan-Micael Key and Jordan Peele. Renaissance movie icon Keanu practically highjacks every scene he's in as Evel Knievel-lite stunt biker toy Duke Caboom. No one commands 'Whoa.' - like Keanu.In the end 'Toy Story 4' touches our hearts, because of the history and partnership of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. Everyone deserves to be loved, even a toy. When Buzz says to Woody, 'She'll be okay...' We get it. We do, because we love. I loved 'Toy Story 4'. It's something very special.",9,36,68,25 June 2019
Batman Begins," What Defines You
","Before Batman (Christian Bale) battles his mortal enemy Ducard (Liam Neeson), he recalls to D.A. Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes), '...It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.' Director Christopher Nolan truly defines the dark and tragic hero, Batman, by reinventing this uncompromising and Gothic tale of the origins of Bruce Wayne and his symbol of justice, Batman. His hero's will and actions define Batman. Nolan's 'Batman Begins' is the best Batman movie-- one of the best movies of the year. Screen writers David Goyer and Chris Nolan have created a powerful narrative driven by strong character, classic tragedy, and sheer will. As the movie opens, Wayne fortune heir, Bruce Wayne is searching for the darkness that lies in all men, in Tibet. He believes therein lies true power. He becomes disciple of the Ninja Clan, The League of Shadows, lead by the powerful, Ra's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). Wayne's ninja mentor, Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), tells his charge, 'To conquer your fear, you must first become your fear.' Personally, I have an affinity for Bruce Wayne, as a man who 'masks his guilt' with great rage and fear.Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents as a young boy. He blames himself for not being strong enough to save his parents, and not being strong enough to avenge them as a young man. His refuge with The League of Shadows ends when his act of mercy is deemed as betrayal.Bruce returns to Gotham City and Wayne Manor. Gotham is ravaged by crime, corruption, and economic depression. All the work of his late philanthropist father, Thomas Wayne (Linus Roache), has fallen in vain. Wayne Corp. is now run by bottom line conscious Chairman of the Board, Mr, Earle (Rutger Hauer). Bruce reunites with his butler and caretaker, Alfred (Michael Cain). Their relationship is the underlying strength of the movie, even more so than Bruce's romance with his childhood sweetheart, Rachel (Katie Holmes). Alfred raised Bruce after his parents were brutally murdered, and always believes in and see the best in 'Master Bruce'. Alfred believes in Bruce, when Bruce has forsaken himself. There is a moving scene toward the end when everything has gone awry, Bruce confides in Alfred, 'You still haven't given up on me...' Powerful relationships and the belief in people's best distinguish 'Batman Begins'.The tale of Gotham City follows several different story threads. Grown up D.A. Rachel Dawes is a target of a crime syndicate lead by Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), refusing to compromise her ideals. A large drug shipment is due in Gotham. One of the drugs is cocaine. The other is a deadly mind altering drug, employed by sanitarium director, Dr. Jonathan Crane (a very creepy Cillian Murphy), who is also super-villain, Scarecrow. This is part of the conspiracy to vanquish all of Gotham City using this X-like drug, to establish a new order.Christian Bale is simply an amazing and commanding force as Bruce Wayne/Batman. He is a tortured and charismatic soul. Bale is so believable as both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Bruce Wayne becomes Batman to confront his fear, and reconcile his quest for justice and revenge which may be two sides of the same coin in this context. Wayne's journey to find peace in life, starts with battling evil as a symbol. As a man he knows that he can be killed. An ideal or symbol can live forever. The great thing about the movie, is that in the end compassion and mercy are qualities of great strength. Batman is distinct among the Superheroes in that he does not possess any superpowers. He uses his intelligence, skill, and courage. He battles evil driven by sheer force of will. Bale imposes awesome will as Batman and Bruce Wayne.However, even sheer will needs to enroll others in the cause of justice over great evil. Enter, Lucius Fox played by the great Morgan Freeman. Freeman adds a refreshing light touch as the 'James Bond- M' to Batman. Fox is the Wayne Corp. scientist demoted to the labs-- pastures. Fox provides the body armor, utilities, and Batmobile to the Gothic hero. Batman is now ready to battle the evil in Gotham, and more profoundly reconcile the fear and rage deep inside himself.The fact that the love story of Bruce and Rachel is downplayed, is effective. This emphasizes the tragedy that is Bruce Wayne's journey. Katie Holmes is perfect as Rachel Dawes. Her Rachel is the heart-broken idealist, who despite all has faith in Bruce. Holmes is beautiful, exuding a quiet strength and faith.The supporting cast are amazingly talented. Liam Neeson as Ducard is powerful, and his character turn is surprising. Michael Caine gives Alfred such strength and compassion. He provides a soul in Chris Nolan's Gothic vision. Gary Oldman is rock solid as Det. Jim Gordon (before he was Commissioner Gordon). Ken Watanabe is awesome as Ra's Al Ghul, which is a surprising cameo role.Nolan gives 'Batman Begins' a physically dark, gritty look that is visually stunning. The action sequences are expertly done. The ninja fighting and training scenes are amazing. The fighting sequences with Bale as Batman are sleek and crisp. He truly mastered the physical aspect of the character. In the end acknowledge Nolan for making a movie driven by strong characters and a compelling hero's story. Christian Bale has arrived as a major force. He imposes his sheer will as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Nolan and Bale have reinvented Batman, having something to say. Ultimately, 'Batman Begins' is a story of redemption, compassion, and mercy. In this context may Batman as a symbol live on.",10,1,2,18 June 2005
Twilight," Forever Young
","The darkly charismatic Robert Pattinson who plays Edward confesses to Kristen Stewart's Bella, ' What if I'm not the hero?' The captivated Bella has done the vampire math: Edward is incredibly strong and fast, and his pale skin is icy to the touch. 17 year-old Bella Swan is falling in love with 17 year-old Edward Cullen, who has been 17 years old for a very long time. In fact Edward is immortal, a vampire who may have found his soul mate in Bella. Edward can read everyone's mind except for Bella, perhaps fate. The noble Edward must resist his own powerful natural instincts condemning his beloved Bella to the life of a monster. However, innocent Bella invites this transformation saying, 'I dream about being with you forever.' This is the world of yearning and suffering in Director Catherine Hardwicke's 'Twilight'.'Twilight' is based on the first novel of the bestselling tween vampire series by Stephenie Meyer. Melissa Rosenberg wrote the screenplay for the Meyer book. Apparently Rosenberg's screenplay is loyal to the book which may be paradoxically a mixed blessing. Pattison and Stewart authentically enroll us in this Gothic world with their powerful performances. However, some of the dialogue borders on cheesy. This is really just an observation, and an artifact of the novel's adaptation. When Edward reveals the amazing secret of vampires in sunlight, Bella is entranced. Edward reminds, 'I'm a killer!' In the climactic battle between Edward and the powerful malevolent James (commanding and strong Cam Gigandet), he screams, 'I'm strong enough to kill you!'Surprisingly, 'Twilight' works as a moving Gothic love story of yearning and eternal love. Yes, we are talking teen love story in the world of modern day vampires. Ultimately, Pattinson and Stewart elevate the story and the movie. Stewart is an amazing young actress. She conveys a vulnerability, strength, keen intelligence, and accessible loneliness. As Bella she displays a quiet beauty and trust. Robert Pattinson is going to be a big star. As Edward he embodies a brooding and charismatic presence reminiscent of James Dean. Pattinson also possesses a natural lightness that balances the suffering of his character. Together Pattinson and Stewart have a palpable and electric chemistry which drives 'Twilight'.Bella (Stewart) is a lonely teenage girl from Phoenix, who chooses to come to live with her Dad Charlie Swan (solid and concerned Billy Burke) in a small town in Washington, when her Mom decides to go on the road with new minor league ball player husband. Charlie is a sheriff in the town. Bella meets her Dad's friends Billy and Jacob Black (Gil Birmingham and Taylor Lauter). Being the new kid at school, Bella gradually settles in. She soon encounters the mysterious Cullen's. Apparently, they are the adopted children of Dr. Carlisle Cullen (cool Peter Facinelli), who lives in a mansion on the fringe of the county. Bella finds herself strangely drawn to the sullen Edward (Pattinson). One day Edward displays amazing physical prowess when he saves Bella from certain death. Bella thanks Edward, and questions who he really is. Edward dismisses all as an adrenaline rush, and warns her to stay away. Bella is determined to uncover the truth.Jacob (Lauter), who secretly is in love with Bella, tells her of an Indian legend surrounding his family and the Cullen's shrouded in the supernatural. The Cullen's are sort of 'vegetarian' vampires, surviving only on the blood of animals—not humans. Edward is falling in love with Bella, and suffers with his instinctive blood lust. He can not allow himself to destroy the object of his love. His turmoil abounds when the human blood lusting vampires arrive: James, Laurent, and Victoria (Gigandet, Edi Gathegi, and Rochelle Lefevre). They and James in particular will kill humans to satisfy their blood hunger. Edward must protect Bella from James, and ultimately from himself.Catherine Hardwicke orchestrates the furious action and Gothic love story with engrossing style and passion. 'Twilight' has a slick and stunning visual style. Granted in a modern vampire tale, vampires are beautiful with killer abs, and haunting consciences. But then again, that is just the deal. Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart are powerful and compelling, and we care about their characters and 'Twilight' as a whole.",8,4,8,23 November 2008
Blue Crush," Cool Summer Ride
","John Stockwell's 'Blue Crush' is a surprisingly good and very entertaining movie. 'Blue Crush' has attractive strong young women stars, killer surfing sequences, and a story by Lizzy Weiss and Stockwell which actually holds our interest for the duration. Also having the stars surfing in bikinis is literary genius on Stockwell's part-- respecting the surf movie tradition. Kate Bosworth plays Anne Marie, a former junior surfing champion, who has been out of competition since a nearly fatal surfing accident in a tournament. She and her surfing buds, Eden (a very intense Michelle Rodriguez), and Lena (a breezy Sanoe Lake) currently work as hotel maids at a Maui resort. This allows them to be surfer girls. Anne Marie has taken on the responsibility to raise her younger sister Penny (well played by Mika Boorem). She is also training to make her come back in the International 'Pipeline' Tournament. No nonsense Eden questions Anne Marie's commitment, when she pursues a possible relationship with a visiting Pro Quaterback, Matthew (played with goofy charm by Matt Tollan). 'Blue Crush' has the teen soap opera thing going, and the build up to the day of reckoning surfing tournament which is kind of ordinary. However, what distinguishes 'Blue' is the smart dialog, and that the movie is really about character and not giving up. Kate Bosworth is a star. Besides being gorgeous and athletic, she is both charismatic and vulnerable. She always comes across the screen as real. Her Anne Marie is doing the best she can, and she is up greatness, even though she is falling and failing. That is inspiring. I love strong, tough characters up to something in life in movies-- much like people in real life. 'Blue' also has amazingly photographed surfing sequences with some of the most dangerous surf in the world. 'Blue Crush' is the perfect summer ride.",8,0,0,1 September 2002
Meet the Fockers," The Inner Circle
","Director Jay Roach's 'Meet the Fockers' is funnier than it's predecessor, 'Meet the Parents' (also directed by Roach). Although it basically is a collection of outrageous gags, that really has no point. After watching the story on screen by John Hamburg and James Herzfeld, one leaves having laughed a lot, and remembering it was more or less about the future in-laws meeting. The jokes in 'Meet the Fockers' are very funny, but not particularly clever. It is dominated by bathroom humor, and sex jokes. This is puzzling given the caliber of the casting.Ben Stiller returns as Greg (aka Gaylord) Focker, who is traveling with his fiancé, Pam (Teri Polo), along with her parents, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro) and his wife Dina (Blythe Danner), to visit Greg's parents Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbara Streisand) in Florida. Of course the Fockers are the polar opposite of the Byrnes. Roz (Streisand) is a sex therapist for senior citizens which is introduced in a hilarious fashion. Bernie is an attorney of some sort. Recall that Jack Byrnes is a retired CIA operative, and Dina was a homemaker. To illustrate Jack's anal retentive instincts, we have his sign-language trained grandson, Little Jack (Spencer/Bradeley Pickren). Little Jack also has a nursing practice that is both hysterical, and a little creepy. Anyway, things do not go smoothly in the family bonding department. Ultimately, Greg is excluded from Jack's Inner Circle. There are some great gags involving fondue, family football, and truth serum. This time around Stiller's Greg is edgy and has more character. In 'Meet the Parents' I found Greg an annoying spineless punk. I think he benefits more from this story, because he is the more normal character in this parental freak show. Hoffman, Streisand, and Danner are good. DeNiro as Jack is completely psycho. He pulls back in the end, but for the most part his Jack is unlikeable. This may have been a miscalculation.There will probably be another sequel. Though I really did not see the point of this one. Comedies are a funny thing. I think a classic comedy makes you laugh a whole lot, and at the same time has some sort of redeeming or human quality. 'Meet the Fockers' is very funny, but is not a classic comedy.",7,1,5,30 December 2004
The Favourite," The Favourite: 'It's all about me!'
","Set in 18th century England, Director Yorgos Lanthimos's 'The Favourite' stars Emma Stone as maid Abigail and Rachel Weisz as Lady Sarah, who both serve Queen Anne, played by amazing Olivia Colman. In 'The Favourite' Abigail and Sarah contest to be Anne's 'favourite' in more than conventional distinctions.Rachel's Sarah is Lady Marlborough, whose husband leads the English military campaign against the French. The physically unattractive self-aware Queen suffers from gout and associated maladies; thus, rendering Sarah as her renegade proxy. The Machiavellian Sarah instructs Anne to double the taxes to finance the War effort to support her husband, ending the War, and bringing him home.Pretty young Abigail, played by Emma, arrives on the scene reunited with her cousin Sarah, played by Rachel. Abigail was from a noble family, but dark financial times beset her Father, who sold her to the older German rival, essentially selling her into sexual slavery. Consequently, Abigail is driven by redemption. She seeks to regain her nobility and stature at any cost. Perhaps, cousin Sarah becomes her leverage point?Sarah enlists Abigail to tend to the Queen, while she basically manages the affairs of England. The skilled herbalist Abigail soon gains favored status of Anne, played by Olivia. One night while surprisingly educated Abigail reads in Anne's library, she discovers the nature of Sarah's relationship with the Queen. It becomes transparent to Abigail what she must do to become the Queen's 'Favourite'.Olivia plays Anne with touching wounded loneliness. Her Anne knows that she can get whatever she wants, because she is the Queen. If not for that, hardly anyone would want anything to do with her. Olivia's profound sadness in Anne humanizes the angry beast. She exposes the lightness and darkness in Anne, and in ourselves. Anne is all about herself, as is everyone in Writers Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara's narrative.In a defining scene in a local bar, Emma's Abigail confesses, 'I'm on my side!' The hysterical, yet mostly anguished narrative of 'The Favourite' is: It's all about me. In Yorgos's tale women rule with power up front and behind the scenes. This is not necessarily the polarized #Metoo narrative either. Yorgos depicts the well of ugliness in society in vast contrast to the stunning visuals of Robbie Ryan's beautiful cinematography. We see Sarah riding her horse on the immaculate English estate. At the same time, Abigail and Sarah scheme to one up the other in gaining the Queen's favors in the palace.Both Emma and Rachel are inspired. Rachel's Sarah is the regal lioness, who takes no prisoners. However, in her utter humiliation Rachel reveals her humanity in redemption. Emma is brilliant initially enrolling us in the suffering innocent maiden with the tortured soul. Emma subtly transforms Abigail as the gentle eyed ruthless mercenary. For Abigail the ends and the means are the same. In the heartbreaking scene Sarah cries to Anne, 'I never lied to you... That's love.' Perhaps, love is more than just that.'The Favourite' might be one of the best movies of the year. Yet, I wasn't on anyone's 'side' in 'The Favourite'. Everyone in the movie is all about themselves. I suppose that's Yorgos, Deborah and Tony's point. 'The Favourite' is hysterical with its clever banter of classism and sexism. Yet, ultimately it is all very sad. Everyone uses someone else. And so goes the world of 'The Favourite'. 'The Favourite' is a great movie, although not my favorite. Let's put it this way: I won't be seeing it again.",8,6,14,18 December 2018
Seabiscuit," The Movie that could...
","Gary Ross's 'Sea Biscuit' is the best movie of the year, and moreover, it is simply a great movie. Written and directed by Gary Ross, based on a book by Laura Hillenbrand 'Sea Biscuit' is a wonderfully woven fable-like tale that moves, touches, and inspires. What 'Sea Biscuit' is about is greatness-- having heart. It is unmistakeably sentimental, and I love sentimental done well. Jeff Bridges is solid as Charles Howard, a depression era millionaire, who becomes the owner of Sea Biscuit. Biscuit is a descendant of Man of War, but he never seemed to reach his potential. The horse is 'a little banged up.' And so is Howard (Bridges). He tragically lost a young son, and soon after is divorced from his wife. Howard slowly creates a new life. He marries a young wife, Marcela (a strong and beautiful Elizabeth Banks). After buying Sea Biscuit, he assembles a team of seemingly misfits around the horse. Chris Cooper is effective as the horse whisperer like trainer, Tom Smith. Tobey Maguire captures the spirit and charm of Red Pollard, the 'too big' jockey for this small horse. Howard ends up challenging the best bred and trained horse of that era, in what was deemed the race of the century. I initially wrote off seeing 'Sea Biscuit'-- how interesting can a movie about a horse be? Then a dear friend, John, recommended that I see it, because he said that the movie is really about perfection versus greatness. Both live in the realm of excellence, but are distinct. And that definitely interested me. Perfection is like the horse Sea Biscuit races (I don't even remember the name). He is the biggest, the strongest, has the best genes and the best training. Red (Maguire) says that what makes Sea Biscuit great is that he has heart. Bridges say at a pivotal point in the movie, 'You don't put someone 'down', just 'cause they're a little banged up.' At some point throughout the entire movie, every one of these characters is down whether it is Red or Biscuit. And there is always someone to give them a hand up. Perhaps greatness lies in community and family, and perfection is a lonely pursuit. All the racing sequences are breathtaking. I was truly moved and touched during the final sequences of the movie. Yes, I was cheering. 'Sea Biscuit' is truly great-- It has heart.",10,0,0,28 August 2003
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," 'Ghost Protocol' is Awesome
","Tom Cruise slashes a side kick at the bad guy's head in a vicious fight in the Dubai Tower Hotel room. Almost 50, Cruise is as intense as ever and looks amazing. He is strong and fit executing deadly impact in his martial arts fight sequences. Under Director Brad Bird's lead Cruise displays distinct gravitas and an unexpected sense of humor as intrepid Agent Ethan Hunt in 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol'. I saw 'Ghost Protocol' in IMAX, and it is visually breathtaking. Given the technology of the medium, apparently 25 minutes of the movie was filmed in IMAX. First time live-action Director Bird ('The Incredibles') selectively created action sequences for the effect including Cruise scaling the outside of the 160 plus story Dubai Tower, and demolition of the Kremlin. Bird generates amazing style, energy, and emotion. He and Cruise make this the best 'Mission: Impossible'. In fact 'Ghost Protocol' may be one of the best movies of the year.The scope of the movie is ambitious. Writers Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec's story spans from Budapest, Russia, Dubai to Mumbai. The plot is often flimsy with Bird throttling through with manic velocity. The character driven story elevates 'Ghost Protocol' with powerful Cruise and charismatic Jeremy Renner as Brandt. They have an unexpected fun chemistry. In a hysterical scene following a brutal assassination attempt, Brandt argues with Ethan about how he knew that using a flare and a dead body would ensure their escape. Intensity is both their strong suits, and their effacing humor is priceless. Bird always seems to influence the right tone.As 'Ghost Protocol' opens Agent Hanaway (rugged Josh Holloway) is gunned down by assassin Sabine Moreau (seductive Lea Seydoux) in failed mission operation—compromising Russian Nuclear Launch codes. Surprisingly, Ethan (Cruise) is captive in a Russian prison. At the conclusion of the last 'Mission: Impossible' we recalled Ethan heading off into the sunset with his new wife, Julia. What went so wrong? IMF agents Jane (stunning Paula Patton) and Benji (comically ironic Simon Pegg) brazenly break Ethan out of prison, with unforeseen complications. Jane explains the reason for his rescue, and she confesses to Ethan her relationship with Hanaway in her blown op. Turns out anarchist physicist Hendricks (evil dour Michael Nyqvist) also associated with Cobalt, is determined to use the codes to initiate global thermal nuclear war.Ethan and his team accept their mission which takes them to the Kremlin to stop Hendricks—here it gets a little fuzzy. However, in a massive conspiracy the Kremlin is reduced to rubble. In IMAX this has an eerie authenticity. Ethan, Jane, and Benji become framed for this terrorist act. The President invokes Ghost Protocol on the IMF, disavowing them. Ethan has clandestine meeting with resigning IMF Secretary (great and grave Tom Wilkinson) and 'Analyst' Brandt (acute Renner). The Secretary offers him an out, but tragedy consumes.Going rogue Ethan and his team must stop Hendricks. The mysterious Brandt is seemingly more than he appears. Here Appelbaum and Nemec's character play engrosses within the twirling story threads. Renner brilliantly balances his aloofness and courage as Brandt. He more than holds his own with the fighting sequences with Cruise. He is a physical presence. Brandt shares his dark secret with Jane. Paula Patton is stellar as Jane. Patton is stunningly beautiful and strong, but also plays emotionally wounded. Cruise has a poignant moment with Patton warning her that her revenge jeopardizes their mission. His Ethan confesses that he also knows what it is to lose someone you love. Pegg as Benji seems solely comic relief. Fortunately, Bird and the writers allow Pegg to expand and transform into a hero as well. Tom Cruise leaves nothing in the tank. He is awesome. He reminds us of his commanding presence and displays a maturing sense of mortality. And Tom does almost all of his stunts. In the grand scheme this makes 'Ghost Protocol' soar. The distinction of the hero is that he is someone, who is in action. That is Cruise here. We cheer for him whether he is careening on the Dubai Tower or trying to stop the end of the world. Brad Bird delivers us the killer visual spectacle in his hero story. I love movie heroes. I love 'Mission: Impossible- Ghost Protocol'.",10,6,9,20 December 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," So in the end: Was it worth it?
","'Avengers: Infinity War' is awesome. Surprisingly, much beauty arises in its imperfection. 'Infinity War' embodies the catharsis of the superhero tale of The Avengers. The visuals are dazzling; the battles have never been more spectacular or more costly. Despite having way too many superheroes in this 2 hour 40 minute experience, what makes 'Infinity War' so compelling is the villain Thanos. Charismatic and sad Josh Brolin gifts the amazing motion capture performance of galactic warrior Thanos, the hulking man-like creature Son of Saturn's Moon Titan. I agree with my buddy Marc: I get who Thanos is. As a child he watched his vibrant Titan die, due to over population; thus exhausting its resources. That was his epiphany. Thanos 'adopts' daughters Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by Karen Gillan, on his merciless conquests across the universe. Now the feared warrior Thanos possesses the Infinity Gauntlet, the golden mechanical glove with the Infinity Stones. When he possesses all six stones, he will have the power to wipe out half of all humanity with the snap of his finger. In his own enlightened twist way, he believes that he is benevolent. That is he for the greater good. At the narrative arc of 'Infinity War' Thanos tells Doctor Strange, master of the Mystic Arts and Earth's defender, played by understated and powerful Benedict Cumberbatch, of killing off half of the known universe with the snap of his finger, 'I call that mercy.' Doctor Strange asks, 'And then what?' Thanos replies, 'I finally rest...' Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo string a cohesive narrative thread with the inspired screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, wisely focusing our attention on Thanos. Thus, humanizing him before our eyes. 'Infinity War' is great, yet not greater than 'Black Panther'. Where 'Black Panther' was the self-sustained tale of becoming greater, 'Infinity War' is more the Act 2 of the Avenger's hero morality play. Even amidst the often tangled story lines of the rift between Robert Downey Jr.' s Iron Man and Chris Evans's Captain America, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor's displacement from his home World Asgaard, 'Infinity War' is surprisingly and poignantly about the cost of being right; however justified we might be. In that the Russo Brothers do the little things humanely: child Gamora asks her father Thanos, 'What did it cost?' Thanos replies, 'Everything.' So was it worth it?Chris Hemsworth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Zoe Saldana, and Chris Evans rock as Thor, Doc Strange, Gamora, and Captain America - Steve Rogers are amazing. Hemsworth is refreshingly badass as Thor, fueled by his vengeance upon Thanos. Cumberbatch is quiet confidence and wisdom as Doctor Strange, who may possess the key to the actual 'endgame'. Evans always embodies such conviction and earnestness in idealist Captain America. Saldana is so powerful stealing the movie displaying authentic humanity in her love - despise relationship with her father Thanos. Their personal story resonates above the sometimes distracting number of heroes and splintering narrative threads. So in the end was it worth it for Thanos? Does he get what he really wants? At least for me, I was surprised in 'Avenger: Infinity War' in a great way. So it was worth it. Even with the totally WTF conclusion, I still have hope. I can't wait to see what happens in May 2019.",9,5,14,1 May 2018
X-Men: The Last Stand," Taking a Stand
","Brett Ratner assumed the helm of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' when Bryan Singer had forsaken completion of the 'X-Men' trilogy to direct 'Superman Returns'. Concerns regarding Director Ratner's vision of the Final Act of the beloved trilogy are unwarranted. Ratner along with screenwriters Simon Kinberg ('Mr. & Mrs. Smith') and Zak Penn ignite new energy in the X-Men saga, and provide an emotional catharsis in 'The Last Stand'. Hugh Jackman returning as hero Logan emerges as a powerful force in this dramatic story arc. Consider the context: 'X-Men' has transcended from comic book adaptation to heroic mythology on its own. Mutants born with the X gene, the source of their great powers, are also cursed in a society that professes diversity without the distinction of profound acceptance. In 'X-Men' the Mutant plight is a metaphor for the danger of prejudice in all its forms. The Mutants fall into two polarized factions in confronting prejudice. Those who follow Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believe the path lies in tolerance, and protecting those who may hate them that being humans. Eric Lensherr (Magneto) proclaims, 'We (Mutants) are the cure!' Magneto (powerful Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor, believes in his heart that Humans are calling for the genocide of all Mutants, and in fact that Mutants are the next evolution of Humanity. A war is coming, and Magneto intends to win. Lensherr asks, 'Who will you stand with?' In 'X-Men: The Last Stand' a 'cure' for mutation now exists. Dr. Hank McCoy (unrecognizable Kelsey Grammar), Secretary of Mutant Affairs, informs Xavier, Storm (Halle Berry), and Logan (Jackman) that a mutant vaccine has been discovered and manufactured by a major pharmaceutical company that is being offered to the public. The vaccine suppresses the Mutant X gene allowing the recipient to live a 'normal' life. Storm points out that there is 'nothing to cure'. The key to the 'cure' lies in Mutant Jimmy/ Leech (Cameron Bright), who has the paradoxical power to neutralize a Mutant's powers. Warren Worthington II (Michael Murphy), whose company manufactures the vaccine, intends to cure his mutant son Warren (Ben Foster).On a more personal note, both Scott Summers (James Marsden) and Logan (Jackman) are dealing with the loss of Jean Grey (charismatic Famke Janssen), who sacrificed her life to save her fellow X-Men. Scott has withdrawn emotionally, telling Logan, 'No one heals as fast as you do...' Apparently, Jean is telepathically communicating with Scott. For those familiar with the comic book, this follows the Dark Phoenix saga. Flashback 20 years ago, as then 'School for the Gifted' partners Xavier and Lensherr visit the Grey household to talk with young Jean, who is a rare 'class 5 mutant'. Jean demonstrates terrifying telekinetic prowess. Here writers Kinberg and Penn expertly spin our allegiance. Xavier, questioning Jean's capacity for restraint, imposes subconscious controls upon her power, part of the Dark Phoenix origin. What is captivating: Xavier's actions are all control and for normalcy, and not at all about freedom. So does this make Lensherr freedom's champion? Perhaps. Although the militant Magneto (Lensherr) is all about 'The ends justify the means.' Ian McKellen is simply compelling as the charismatic Magneto. His is a strange wisdom in the matter. This ideological paradox along with the visually stunning physical conflict distinguishes 'The Last Stand'. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey and Dark Phoenix is a surprisingly powerful presence as she battles to retain a vestige of her own humanity. The love story of Jean and Logan (Jackman) is heartbreaking, and the soul of 'The Last Stand'. Logan pleads with Jean, '(I would die) for you!' 'X-Men: The Last Stand' is Hugh Jackman's movie. He is the right actor for the right role. Jackman is powerful. As Logan, he delicately balances this unbridled rage and touching compassion. Jackman also embodies the hero's honor which is the core value of 'X-Men'. Logan is not a nice guy by any means. But no one fights as fiercely or has as noble a spirit as Logan doescredit Jackman again. Logan's forest fight scene is totally amazing. Jackman looks phenomenal and has such a physical presence. No one does hero like Jackman. Oscar winner Halle Berry fairs much better here in Act III. As Storm, Xavier anointed leader of the X-Men, Berry is very strong and the voice of reason. The stunning Berry's cool presence and composure are finally capitalized upon. Patrick Stewart gives a renewed passion and complexity to Xavier, whose character until now seemed void of gray. Stewart is valiant as a character serving penance for a grave misdeed. Of the numerous new mutants, Kitty (Ellen) and Colossus (David Cudmore) distinguish themselves. Some of the familiar characters like Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Mystique (Rebecca Romajin) have been delegated to background stories. One of the weaknesses of 'The Last Stand' is the introduction of way too many characters. 'The Last Stand' is also stripped of some welcome exposition in its lean 105 minutes. However, Ratner's alacrity does do justice to the story. Like great mythology, 'X-Men: The Last Stand' tells a story of impassioned conflict, courage, love, and honor. This is a great 'Last Stand'. And perhaps, this is not the last, after all.",10,4,8,27 May 2006
P.S. I Love You," P.S. Move On
","In a poignant scene Gerald Butler's spirit of Gerry confesses to Hilary Swank's Holly, 'I'm not asking you to remember me' and to move on. Although being a little too long, Writer and Director Richard LaGravenese's 'P.S. I Love You' is a whimsical and surprisingly touching romantic comedy about life continuing forward. Swank and LaGravenese have collaborated before on 'Freedom Writers' as evidenced in the movie's comfortable and sturdy feel. Hilary Swank is great in this romantic comedy, an edgy departure for the actor. Swank thrives--she never forces the humor, completely natural. She embodies a humanity and spirit in Holly that makes her vulnerable and funny in the story's context. Gerald Bulter is boldly charming as Holly's late husband Gerry, the Irishman full of life and dreams. Swank and Butler have a wondrous chemistry that smooths out the rougher edges of LaGravenese and Steve Rogers screenplay based on the novel by Wendy Finerman.Even with its over wrought indulgences, 'P.S. I Love You' rewards the narrative payoff. Wisely on the part of LaGravenese and Rogers, the catharsis opts for the lyrical and realm of possibility. The performances are stellar. Academy Award Winner Kathy Bates is awesome as Holly's mother Patricia. Seeing fellow Oscar Winner Swank and Bates together is truly something special. There is a heartbreaking scene where Swank's Holly breaks down to her mother saying, 'I'm alone!' Later Bates's Patrica says to her daughter, 'If you're all alone, we're all together with you in that, too.' So even with its intentional quirks and cheesy trappings-- all is forgiven, because ultimately 'P.S. I Love You' is about the courage to love again and live life.As 'P.S' opens Holly is furious that Gerry told her mother at dinner that they are not planning on having kids right now. Although accurate, Holly is still livid. Holly laments that she is waiting for her life to start. Gerry reminds, 'We are in life' Transparent to us: Gerry and Holly are soul matesthe great love of each other's life. Fast forward several months, Gerry has died of a brain tumor. After the wake, Holly discovers that Gerry has arranged for the delivery of his letters all making requests of Holly. Unable or perhaps unwilling to move on after her loss, this may not be the best thing for Holly. Or is it a way for Holly to discover life anew? Much of the movie's charm derives from Holly's trip to Gerry's Irish homeland, and her loyal friends. Lisa Kudrow plays Denise, Holly's gal pal who is crassly determined to hunt down a single, straight, and employed mana crusade seemingly more difficult than it seems. Kudrow is at her scattered and hysterical best. Hot and sexy Gina Gershon plays other gal pal Sharon. Gershon is deceivingly strong and smart with the apparently vapid Sharon, who really possesses a depth of character. In a surprising moment in what initially feels like a frivolously long fishing scene with all three women, reminds Holly that her friends are moving on with their lives. Holly's trip to Ireland is a beautiful interlude that represents an eloquent return to the traditional and solid. Here LaGravenese brilliantly orchestrates his story of love everlasting and regret. Hilary Swank amazingly balances the suffering and resolute spirit in Holly. She too is brilliant and absolutely beautiful. Her smile just lights up your soul, and her anguish strikes an emotional chord. Gerald Butler is at his charismatic best. Butler also expertly tempers his charm with a touching and gentle compassion.'P.S. I Love You' is one of the best romantic comedies in a long while, that has a great love story. Richard LaGravenese tells a wistful and touching tale with amazing performances and chemistry by Hilary Swank and Gerald Butler. Take a chance on 'P.S. I Love You'.",9,188,245,26 December 2007
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Present
","In Afghanistan on the snow covered Himalayan Mountains grizzled and world wise Sean O'Connell played by Sean Penn gazes at his coveted photo moment. Sean says that all he wants is to be 'in the moment'. Sean Penn is selfless gravitas in this moment as he confides in Ben Stiller's exasperated mild mannered Walter Mitty, who literally travels to the ends of the earth to track down the maverick old-school legendary photographer. Be in the moment and be present in life--are the eloquently poignant lyrics of Director Ben Stiller's 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty'. I loved the James Thurber short story which Writer Steve Conrad based his update. Walter is the chronic day dreamer, an escape from his ordinary life. At times Director Stiller and Writer Conrad teeter capriciously all over the narrative landscape including a hysterical and touching eHarmony thread. Granted they humorously frame Walter's 'zone outs' from reality. One obscure gag from 'Benjamin Button' is nearly wacky enough to spiral into incoherence—fortunately it does not. There is the amazing upside. In a joyously freeing scene Walter skateboards down the winding roads of Iceland; spectacularly filmed by Stuart Dryburgh. Kristen Wiig in a touching turn goes unplugged with David Bowie's 'Ground Control to Major Tom'. All the curious rifting I think is forgivable for its noble purpose. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' celebrates being present in life. No one is alone. Ben Stiller is quietly heroic navigating Walter's transformation into the unknown. His blank stares as Walter 'zones out' touch the depth of our own vulnerabilities. He is bold, funny, and aware. Walter Mitty (Stiller) is a photo negative archiver at Life Magazine. He has given up on his dreams, taking on the financial and emotional stress of his aging Mom brilliantly played by Shirley MacLaine, about to enter a care home. His sister is flighty wannabe actress Odessa (good Kathryn Hahn), dreams of playing Rizzo in 'Grease'. Walter joined eHarmony so he can date Cheryl Melhof (Kristen Wiig), who works in the same office. Wiig charms as Cheryl, the quirky single Mom of skateboarder son Rich (Marcus Antturi). Cheryl is smart and pretty, and is actually interested in Walter, if he had a clue. Life Magazine has been taken over by another Company. To transition over to an on-line magazine, Ted Hendricks (brilliantly arrogant Adam Scott) heads the restructuring corporate team. Ted is a major jerk— arrogant and not as smart as he thinks. Walter is the sole personal contact of legendary cover photographer Sean O'Connell (Penn). When Sean's photo negative for the cover of Life's last newsstand issue is missing, Ted focuses his attention on Walter. Sean claims this is his best photo of his career. Walter must find the missing negative to save his job and possibly win over Cheryl. Working with Cheryl, Walter starts his search in Greenland. Somehow diverting to Iceland, Walter calls Cheryl from a Papa John's Pizza there. It all ties in. Ben Stiller is inspiring, as 'Walter Mitty' amazingly never takes itself seriously. The movie joyfully celebrates life as illustrated by the beautiful soccer game with Walter and Sean in the Afghan mountains. Stiller makes us pull for Walter as he reclaims his power. Kristen Wiig is funny and compassionate as Walter's gentle muse. She is surprising. Sean Penn is awesome as Sean O'Connell, strong and whimsically wise. Shirley MacLaine anchors in her Mother's unconditional love for her son Walter, without many words. Patton Oswald nearly steals the movie as Todd, the eHarmony profile adviser. Warm and hysterical he punctuates Walter's transformational journey. Stiller reminds us with humor and soul that Life is wonderful when we are present in it. 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' is funny and beautiful.",9,228,318,25 December 2013
The Incredibles," Truly Incredible
","I finally saw Pixar/Disney's 'The Incredibles' after several scheduling glitches. Writer and Director Brad Bird's 'The Incredibles' is truly incredible. It is one of the best movies of the year. The CGI animation is both cutting edge and simply stunning, and like all Pixar projects it has a solid story as it's foundation. Bird uses the Superhero mythology to tell a funny and poignant story: that when we forfeit or withhold our greatness, we are not being true to ourselves, and more importantly it is a disservice to those around us. As the story begins, Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) was the superhero's Superhero. As voiced by Nelson, Mr. Incredible, is very confident, on the verge of cocky. He uses his super strength and powers for good. He marries super, Elasticgirl (Holly Hunter). However, Mr. Incredible soon falls victim like his fellow 'Supers' to the plight of our litigious society-- the people they save are suing them. Instead of getting malpractice insurance (which would have been a different movie), the persecuted... and prosecuted Supers assume their secret identities in a covert government relocation program. They also promise never to use their powers again even for good.We catch up 15 years later with Mr. Incredible, now just Bob Parr, insurance claim adjuster. He is suffering. His wife Helen, the former Elasticgirl, is busy getting settled in their new home with their kids, Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and little Jack Jack. Violet and Dash have super powers, and Jack Jack is not yet toilet trained. Bob is totally frustrated by his job, and really the lie he is forced to live. Every week he and fellow Super, Lucius Best aka Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), on their 'bowling' night, listen to the police radio band so that they can save people in danger. Mild mannered life is killing Bob. He tells Helen regarding Dash's 4th grade graduation, that they keep 'creating new ways to celebrate mediocrity'.One day Bob is contacted by the mysterious, Mirage (Elizabeth Pena), enlisting his super powers for an undisclosed benefactor. Bob, still super strong, no longer has the six pack abdominals. He proceeds to train and trim the waistline. He sees his suit designer, Edna 'E' Mode (Brad Bird), to fix his super suit. In a hilarious exchange, E enrolls Mr. Incredible in a new suit, sans cape. It is disclosed that the benefactor is villain, Syndrome (Jason Lee). Turns out that Mr. Incredible was the one responsible for Syndrome's genesis when he invalidated the young Syndrome 15 years ago. Thus, we have the classic Superhero tale of conflict and revenge.What also distinguishes 'The Incredibles' along with the story about reclaiming greatness, is that it is about family. In a very touching scene when Mr. Incredible is about to do battle with the seemingly invincible Omnidroid, he admits to Helen '...I'm not strong enough...' Having super powers is great. Having the love of family is truly powerful. Craig T. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible. He is bold, funny, and endearingly vulnerable. Holly Hunter is solid and folksy as Helen, who also projects a quiet power. Jason Lee is at his annoying best as Syndrome. Brad Bird as 'E' steals every scene that she is in. Director Brad Bird's 'The Incredibles' is amazing to look at, and also has something special and touching to say.",10,151,198,19 December 2004
Driven," Sly and Crafty Comeback
","Sylvester Stallone's action movie return in Renny Harlin's 'Driven' marks a distinction change in the star's role. Stallone's Joe Tanto is a racing driver sensei, mentor, who was a great driver, drawn out of retirement to coach a young and very talented race car driver, Jimmy Blye (played by Kip Pardue). Tanto coaches Blye on racing and... life. Perhaps, this is trite. Though this seems like a genuine effort from Stallone to phase out the lead action hero part, and take on being the sage adviser to the young action studs like, Kip Pardue and and Til Schweiger. To his credit Sly is very comfortable and convincing in this persona. His script is clunky and very melodramatic with such dialog exchanges between himself and Pardue, 'You don't know who you are?' Excellent question, though like some of the other pieces it seems out of place in this movie. The story is predictable. However, Renny Harlin's direction and visual mastery of the racing sequences keep the movie going, and for the most part engaging. Kip Pardue (last seen in 'Remember the Titans') is good here. Too bad his character does not have much say. It's amazing the women's roles are so forgettable. Stacy Edwards is interesting as Stallone's love interest which seems like an after thought. Why are Gina Gershon and Estella Warren in the movie? Gershon is wasted here-- she is a good actress. On the other hand, Estelle Warren is a waste of time here.",7,0,0,30 April 2001
I Am Legend," Great Legend
","In the opening of 'I Am Legend' Will Smith as Robert Neville along with his dog Sam races through the desolate streets of New York City. We see the striking images of New York City over grown with vegetation, wild deer, and no people. This is Director Francis Lawrence grim post viral infected world of 2012. My bud Ron had told me that 'I Am Legend' was remake of 'Omega Man' starring Charlton Heston, based on a novella from the 1950's. Mark Protosevich and Akiva Goldsman wrote the screenplay for 'I Am Legend' based on the Richard Matheson novel. I have enjoyed 'Omega Man'. 'I Am Legend' is more science fiction thriller than action movie. The action in 'I Am Legend' is intense and spectacular. Will Smith is stark and powerful. It is just Smith for virtually the first half of the movie.In 2009 a doctor played the Emma Thompson announces a breakthrough virus that may be the cure for cancer. However, something goes awry. Soon New York City becomes a military quarantine zone with families desperately scrambling to leave Manhattan. Among those is Col. Neville (Smith), his wife Zoe (Salli Richardson), and daughter Marley (Willow SmithWill's daughter). Neville knows that the virus is now airborne, imposing a deadly threat.Fast-forward 3 years later. Neville tells fellow survivor Anna (Alice Braga), 'Everyone you know is dead!' The virus killed 90% of the world's 6 billion people. Less than 5% survived, because of their built in immunity. The remainder of the population mutated into vicious nocturnal creatures. Meanwhile, Neville has so far been unsuccessful in discovering cure for the viral mutation using the DNA of his own blood. This seems to be Neville's mission and curse. He says, 'God didn't do this. We did.' This is Will Smith's action tour de force. The trimmed and chiseled Smith is in amazing shape, and performs the action with skill and pathos. He engages and enrolls us in Neville's plight and curse as a man on the verge of forfeiting his sanity and humanity. Smith has a poignantly heartbreaking scene with his dog Sam. The charismatic Smith embodies hero in Neville. Beautiful Alice Braga is great as the strong and smart Anna.This does not give away too much. 'I Am Legend' acknowledges the courage and the possibility of humanity in people. Everyone can be a hero, we all need to discover and reclaim this in ourselves. Director Lawrence and Smith tell a great and timeless story.",9,1,3,21 December 2007
Gran Torino," Hero
","Clint Eastwood is perhaps the greatest American Film Director working today. In 'Gran Torino' Clint gives a powerful and riveting performance in his best work as an actor. At 78 years old Director and Actor Eastwood is inspiring and continues to do amazing compelling work. I think Eastwood deserves a Best Actor Nomination. As widower and Korean War hero Walt Kowalski, Clint Eastwood is the familiar strong tough guy, genuinely funny, and touchingly vulnerable. Eastwood commands an authenticity and humanity. The screenplay by Nick Schenk from the story by Dave Johannson and Schenk is a stark tale of prejudice, and possibility in a world of no possibility. In an emotional confession to Father Janovich (good Christopher Carley) Walt says, 'Sue and Thao will never find peace in this world as long as there are gangs' Walt is resolved to find peace for Sue (Ahney Her) and Thao (Bee Vang).Eastwood's Walt is old school. He is a decorated Silver Star Korean War hero, and retired Ford Motors worker. He lives in a small town in Michigan. A Hmong family (of the Thailand, Saigon region) has recently moved next door. Two of the teens are Sue (Her) and Thao (Vang). Walt has a flair for using colorful racial epithets. Here Eastwood is subtle mastery in enrolling us into Walt in spite of himself, hinting at a noble old man reclaiming his usefulness.As 'Gran Torino' opens we observe Walt's wife funeral. Walt lets out an ominous cough. We learn that crotchety Walt has two estranged grown sons, Mitch (great exasperated Brian Haley) and Steve (solid Brian Howe). Mitch and his wife Karen (Geraldine Hughes) are concerned about Walt caring for himself, and suggest a care home facility. Obviously, this does not go over well at Walt's Birthday party.Coerced by his cousin Spider (Doua Moua) as gang initiation, Thao attempts to steal Walt's prized vintage Gran Torino. Walt clumsily scares Thao off. Later Spider and his gang return to punish Thao's failure. Then Walt intervenes in vintage Eastwood style aiming his Army rifle: 'Get off my lawn!' The grateful Hmong families repay Walt's heroism with gifts of flowers and food. The reclusive Walt questions why? Sue (Her) says, ' You're a hero.' Tellingly Walt replies, 'No, I'm no hero.' Like the Hmong families, we know better. For family honor Thao's mom Vu (earnest Brooke Chia Thao) implores Walt to accept Thao's apology and labor. Hysterically Walt questions whether he is the one being punished for a good deed, and advises Thao listen to Sue and his Mom and 'Shut up.' Walt also becomes the hero renewed as he begins to see and inspire the greatness in others. Director Eastwood and Writer Schenk tell this story in eloquent and understated style. Walt admires Sue's smarts and spirit. Walt in an audience cheering moment has to save Sue from street thugs. Later Sue admits that what she did could have ended badly. She also enlightens Walt of the future of her people, 'The girls go to college. The boys go to jail.' Walt begrudgingly sees that Thao (or 'Toad') is a great kid. Eastwood displays a light comic touch as he tells Thao that he is being dense in not asking out the cute girl at a family party. In a classic Eastwood scene, Walt takes Thao to buy tools for his new job at a hardware store. Walt dismisses this as no big deal. Thao insists, 'I really appreciate this No, I really do.' They shake handssubtle screen magic. Bee Vang is a brilliant young presence.Eventually the gang exacts retribution committing heinous and unforgivable acts of violence. Walt sees that Sue and Thao are sentenced to a life of no possibility as long as there are gangsand this must end. Thao asks Walt, 'What is it like to kill someone?' Walt quietly says, 'You don't want to know.' 'Gran Torino' may be the best movie of the year. Eastwood and Schenk compassionately tell a story of reconciling prejudice, the innate greatness in people, and inspired heroes. Ahney Her gives a breakthrough performance as Sue. Her strong textured performance is amazing. Bee Vang is astounding in his authenticity and his screen partnership with Eastwood. Their relationship is inspired and the soul of 'Gran Torino'. This is really Eastwood at his best. His performance is strong, light and funny, and movingly humane. Eastwood truly inspires and celebrates the best in humanity in his amazing and heart felt 'Gran Torino'.",10,1,5,24 December 2008
Hero," Stylized Hero
","A Chinese proverb says that who a man is one of three things: who he thinks he is, who others think he is, and who he really is. 'Hero' (Ying xiong) embodies these distinctions in it's unique visual and narrative style. In this case we have the color schemes of red, blue, and white representing the three perspectives. Director Yimou Zhang's visually stunning metaphor is ambitious and satisfying, but ultimately it is not entirely novel storytelling given the epic nature of this movie. Zhang's previous work included the great love stories, 'Raise the Red Lantern' and 'Ju Dou'. His 'Hero' is also a tragic love story set in ancient China prior to unification and the building of The Great Wall. However, this is more distracting, given this is suppose to be about the 'Hero', Jet Li. Qin is one of the 6 kingdoms of pre-unified China. The King of Qin (Daoming Chen) is a ruthless, brutal, and uninspired ruler whose ambition is to rule all of China. Jet Li plays Nameless, one of his officials, who presents the king with the weapons of his three vanquished assassins-- Sky (Donnie Yen), Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), and Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung). The suspicious King listens to the story of his 'Hero' determining whether he is his true savior or an assassin in a grand conspiracy. 'Hero' has a great premise which falls flat. Jet Li is awesome as Nameless, probably a homage to the Clint Eastwood character in the Sergio Leone movies. Then again this character may be the Chinese mythology. Li has a silent power about him, and is perhaps the best martial arts star of his time. 'Hero' illustrates the classic path of enlightenment for a warrior/ martial artist-- he trains his body and spirit to defeat his enemy, only to discover that protecting or granting life is the only noble pursuit. This is a great distinction, but I think it is muted somewhat at the very end. The dialog at the beginning of 'Hero' is very dense. One gets Nameless (Li) is man of few words and a man of action. However, we get a lot of words in the beginning, literally subtitled. The action sequences are beautiful, stunning, and very stylized much like 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' in the use of aerial wires. In one sense this is a waste given the world class talent of Jet Li. The best fight scene occurs early on with Nameless (Li) and Sky (Donnie Yen). That is amazing grace, power, and passion. Too bad this spirit is not carried throughout the rest of 'Hero'. 'Hero' is beautiful to look at, and has something worthwhile to say, but the audience has little emotive investment in the outcome. That is really a shame.",7,0,1,12 September 2004
Shrek the Third," Getting in Its Own Way
","'Shrek the Third' is funny and has big laughs throughout, and one gets the feel that this installment of the big green guy's story is completely unnecessary. The cryptic symptom of Shrek's demise is somewhat insidious. All the big laughs come from the supporting characters namely Pinocchio (Cody Cameron) and the Ginger Bread Man (Conrad Vernon). Justin Timberlake voices a great turn as Artie, heir to Far Far Away Throne. He has a great scene where he says, 'Sometimes we all get in our own way' This wonderful sentiment is so misplaced in this feeble attempt to empower faith in oneself. Also the movie should have heeded its own advice. 'Shrek' the first was endearing in its message of seeing beyond appearances and finding the value of a person's or ogre's soul. 'Shrek' also had a great sense of humor about life and itself. Apparently, the makers of 'Shrek the Third' have forgotten this legacy. And there are too many involved. Chris Miller is director along with co-director Raman Hui. Still based on the original book by William Steig, there are a horde of writers: Jeff Price, Peter Seaman, J. David Stern, David Weiss, and Jon Zack. Consequently, 'Shrek the Third' is blurred. The movie is funny; however, the laughs are of the sitcom nature. Some of the gags themselves are bewildering. For example, the extended death scene of King Harold (John Cleese) gets old until he finally 'croaks', so to speak. The playing of Paul McCartney and Wings' 'Live and Let Die' at the funeral is out of place and irrelevant. Also who is the main audience of 'Shrek 3'? Old people like me or kids? Kids don't know Wings, much less The Beatles. 'Shrek the Third' is perfunctory funny, but the fairy tale well has gone dry. Rather the writers did not create something fresh, instead polishing a retread.As 'Shrek the Third' opens we find Prince Charming (very funny Rupert Everett) doing very bad dinner theater. Shrek (Mike Myers) and Finona (Cameron Diaz) are filling in for the royal duties of Far Far Away Kingdom, and not really having a good time. So when the King finally dies, Shrek is next in line to the Throne. Unless Shrek can convince Prince Artie (Justin Timberlake) to assume the kingly duties, he will be unable to return to his beloved swamp. Thus, Shrek along with sidekicks Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) embark on mission to retrieve young Artie. Meanwhile, Fiona and mother Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) remain in Far Far Away. Fiona also confesses to Shrek before he leaves, that he will soon be a father. Shrek outwardly does not assume the tower of fatherhood. A ridiculous subplot involves Prince Charming's claim to the Throne. High jinx abound, and there are some touching heart to heart conversations between Shrek and Artie. Unfortunately, nothing really special distinguishes this third go round of the lovable Ogre. The supporting characters seem to corner the market on all the funny lines. Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Antonio Banderas are all great as Shrek, Donkey, and Puss. Cameron Diaz seems relegated to the sidelines in this outing. Rupert Everett provides comic relief as the totally self absorbed and clueless Prince Charming. Perhaps, the movie's only freshness comes from Justin Timberlake as Artie.Other than Timberlake's Artie, 'Shrek the Third' really shows signs of wear and tear. Here 'Shrek 3' even eludes its connection to pop culture. There is a forced 'hip-hop' conversation between Shrek and Artie. 'Shrek the Third' suffers from a stand alone gag structure. There is no coherence. Perhaps, all of the charming and sweet fairy tale essence has been weaned dry. The message near the end about believing in oneself is noble, but seems tacked on and out of context. 'Shrek the Third' is over wrought, funny, and really not worth seeing. Perhaps, 'Shrek 4' will recapture some of what made it so special. Then again, it may be time to move on to something new.",7,0,0,3 June 2007
The Hurt Locker," Where we find peace...
","I finally saw Kathryn Bigelow's 'The Hurt Locker' on DVD. Bigelow's orchestration is masterful. 'The Hurt Locker' is gritty, stark, pulse pounding, and tense. Jeremy Renner emerges as a star, delivering a tragic heroic performance. Much like Bigelow's direction and Mark Boal's storytelling, 'The Hurt Locker' brands an inspired authenticity and grace. Mark Boal's screenplay probably depicts the first story of the horror and heroism of the Iraqi War on the big screen. Renner plays Specialist William James, who leads an Army bomb disposal team that diffuses IEDs. James is called a 'wild man' by gung ho Colonel Reed (always strong and solid David Morse). But there is more to the seemingly fearless or reckless James (Renner). In a poignant arc, James tells nearly shell shocked Eldridge (vulnerable Brian Geraghty), 'Everyone's a coward somewhereÂ…' James replaces beloved deceased Specialist Thompson (charismatic Guy Pearce). James admits to his new team mates Sanborn (powerful Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Geraghty) that he can never hope to truly replace Thompson, who was a good man. He is just here to do his job. However, Sanborn and Eldridge soon wonder if maverick James is going to get them all killed, before their tour of duty is over. In a riveting scene, James uncovers a car laced with IEDs in the middle of the street. Presuming that he is totally screwed, he strips off his protective gear to discern the solution. Here Bigelow is so effective in using hand held and close in shots, resulting in a claustrophobic atmosphere. Everything culminates in a suicide bomber, who has a change of heart, with James's prowess in the balance.The paradox lies not only with the violence and tragedy outside, but also within the characters. Eldridge constantly dreams of his death. Sanborn literally trades blows over James's sanity. Sanborn wonders if they would not better off, if James were dead. Renner balances a cocky heroism with a subdued broken soul in James. Perhaps, James is indeed fearless. But like he told Eldridge that everyone is a coward somewhere; his fear lies perhaps at home. Consequently and ironically, James forms a touching bond with an Iraqi kid Beckham (charming Christopher Sayegh), who sells bootleg DVDs. Tragedy strikes and this trails down the dark path, and insight into James. Here Renner is brilliant. All actions have consequences. In this Bigelow is pitch perfect in her vision, and storytelling. Everyone perhaps forfeits part of their soul in war, and where one finds peace or solace is not necessary what we expect. 'The Hurt Locker' is thoughtful, thrilling, and one of the best movies of the year.",10,2,12,5 March 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Almost Everything...
","'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' charts the distinctly inspired course under Directors Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg. Shimmering new star Kaya Scodelario as Carina touchingly says, 'For a moment I had everythingÂ…' Surprisingly, 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' is about the human treasure: the fulfillment in discovery, and the poignant sadness in loss. Jeff Nathanson and Terry Russo's story and screenplay remain true to the familiar levity and whimsy of the past, and the iconoclast hero Captain Jack Sparrow, reprised with aloof perfection by Johnny Depp. Refreshingly, Ronning and Espen venture into undiscovered seas of family and redemption. 'Dead Men' is visually spectacular with breathtaking beaches and high seas cinematography by Paul Cameron ('Collateral'). Personally, Depp's Jack Sparrow has been the hero's enigma throughout the series. At times he is comically dim for effect, and Depp embodies the breezy stoned cool and indifference. Yet, he fights valiantly for the just cause, usually if not accidentally. Often he occurs as the expository non sequitur. Fortunately, Scodelario and Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner, Will Turner's son, lead as the classic heroes, who fight for love and family on the journey. The level of talent captivates in 'Dead Men'. Depp is the gifted actor with several Oscar Nominations. Academy Award Winners Javier Barden and Geoffrey Rush play the ghost Captain Salazar and Jack's fierce rival Captain Barbosa. At times Barden seems to gnaw the scenery. However, at the story's dramatic arc Depp and Rush are sublime revealing Barbosa's past life. Furious action and splendid CGI aside, amazingly its 'Pirates'' humanity that resounds. As 'Dead Men Tell No Tales' opens 12 year-old Henry Turner finds his cursed Father Will, played with gravitas by Orlando Bloom. Will is the spirit trapped on his shipâ€”the Dutchman. Will instructs his son to locate the map for the Trident of Poseidon which has the power to free Will. The only man who can help him find the 'map that no man can read' is Jack Sparrow. Nine years later aboard the British naval ship, grown Henry, played by earnest and strong Thwaites, encounters the ghost ship captained by Salazar. Wisely, Henry escapes the doomed British ship. Captain Salazar seeks revenge upon Jack, who possesses the Compass that sentenced him and his men to their ghostly eternity. Everyone wants a piece of Jack. Meanwhile on the island of St. Martin, Scodelario's Carina is imprisoned for witchcraft. Really she is jailed for being too smart. Scodelario is beautiful with the piercing gaze of intellect. Her Carina is the horologist, scientist in time measurement, who holds a book from her Father. In that book lies the location of Poseidon's Trident translated through the stars. This is Carina's legacy, her bond to her unknown past. Jack is also on St. Martin, but drunken asleep in a bank vault; part of his crew's botched robbery attempt. He too is eventually jailed by authorities. Both Jack and Carina are sentenced for execution. Well, you probably know how that goes. In the unlikely although necessary partnership, Jack, Carina, Henry, and Barbosa sail the high seas to find the Trident before evil Salazar does. Salazar has his own agenda of power and vengeance. Carina and Henry's noble purpose is the love for their father, and ultimately for each other. In a weird way, Jack transforms as Carina and Henry's protector. Depp is brilliant in balancing Jack's aloof charm and nobility. I guess Jack too is the surprise. In the end the visual effects astound, and yet it's the touching humanity that moves in 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales'. As with the great hero stories the losses are heartfelt, and the triumph is freeing. Depp, Scodelario, and Thwaites are amazing acting partnership. The touching closing homage may even draw tears. Yes, this is the wonderful surprise. Perhaps, there shall be more high seas adventures filled with love, family, and courage.",9,1,8,29 May 2017
Moulin Rouge!," All Need is Love... da...da
","'Moulin Rouge' is not really a movie in the perfunctory sense, rather it is an experience, and a spectacle. 'Moulin Rouge' is visually stunning in it's cinematography, staging, and costuming. The musical is reborn. The dialogue and fusion of contemporary song lyrics are seamless-- truly inspired. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are simply fabulous. The setting is 1899 at the Moulin Rouge in the 'Bohemian Revolution' that virtues Truth, Beauty, Freedom... and most of all Love. The introduction of young writer Christian (McGregor)-- Love's champion though he has never been in love-- drew me in. The woman who will be the love of Christian's life, Satine (Kidman), is a beautiful and isolated courtesan, who professes that she is not allowed to love. What a wonderful setting for classic tragedy, and great music along the way. The first few minutes of MR is disorienting, until the realization: 'This is a musical. Deal with it.' The lyrical element is like a genetic code to this movie. The characters come alive through their singing. McGregor is believable as the writer, Christian, experiencing love for the first time. Kidman as Satine balances the tragedy and humor with grace and style. Both are great singers. John Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec is surprising as the story's muse. Great work here. The movie must get points for having the audacity of doing a musical number of Madonna's 'Like A Virgin' performed entirely by dudes. See the movie...",9,0,1,15 June 2001
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Dim 'New Moon'
","Ironically in 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) watch a movie of 'Romeo and Juliet'. Edward eloquently recites a passage from Shakespeare when called upon by his English teacher. Like 'Romeo and Juliet' what had made 'Twilight' so captivating the first time around was the star-crossed romance of Edward and Bella—vampire and mortal. So why does Edward (charismatic Pattinson) disappear during the prolonged middle of the movie? Instead we suffer through shredded Werewolf boy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) and rebounding Bella (Stewart), who have absolutely no chemistry. Granted Lautner bulked up and looks amazing, but he and Stewart have no sparks and this falls completely flat. Pattinson and Stewart have a genuine visceral chemistry which over comes much of the narrative misgivings and often time awkward dialog. Forgoing that for a good hour of the movie is puzzling. It seems like the movie is shooting itself in the foot.Perhaps, Director Chris Weitz (who replaced Catherine Hardwicke) and Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg are too beholding to the Stephanie Meyer's novel. I never read the 'Twilight' series novels, but I am guessing this is the case. 'New Moon' is awful. More precisely it is a horrendous miscalculation, and disappointment. I really liked 'Twilight' which had a great Gothic romance; about heroes fighting great evil. Here the romance is displaced by the plot line, and the battle between good and powerful evil is ambiguous. Perhaps, again we are just catching Act II of the 5 Act play. None the less, this is not a satisfying experience. Pattinson and Stewart do their best, and almost salvage. However, here they are overwhelmed by the story.As 'New Moon' opens Bella celebrates her 18th Birthday. She loves Edward, but fears what happens when she grows old, while he remains forever young. Edward confides to Bella, 'It's my job to protect you.' Bella's birthday celebration at the Cullen's turns horribly wrong, as Jasper (eerie Jackson Rathbone) nearly goes native vampire on Bella, who accidentally sheds her blood. Convinced his being with Bella will do her harm, Edward tells her, 'You're my only reason to stay alive.' He leaves for Italy to the Volturi—Vampire Royalty. He tells Bella, 'This is the last time you will ever see me.' Distraught Bella falls into depression suffering debilitating nightmares. Edward only appears as Jedi-like ghost attempting to protect his beloved. Slowly Bella pursues a relationship with childhood friend Jacob (Lautner). Jacob himself is going through a transformation—becoming a Werewolf. Recall that Vampire and Werewolves are immortal enemies. New hero Jacob becomes Bella's protector from vengeful vampire. Soon like Edward, Jacob fears he too may inadvertently harm Bella. Bella is forever in love with Edward, and she and his sister Alice (spirited Ashley Green) fly off to rescue Edward, who may be sacrificing his life to the Volturi.There is neither compelling dramatic arc in 'New Moon' nor any vanquishing of great evil. This is really disappointing given some of the amazing performances. Michael Sheen manifests a dark presence as Volturi leader Aro. Dakota Fanning is chilling as powerful vampire Jane. Kristen Stewart authentically embodies the anguish and wonder of teenager Bella. Pattinson is powerful and charismatic, but isn't on the screen nearly enough. 'New Moon' is an unfortunate miscalculation that may correct itself in the next go round. At least one would think so.",6,17,31,22 November 2009
The Illusionist," Love, honor, and magic
","During interrogation by Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) in 'The Illusionist', the magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton) confesses to his supporting crowd, 'Everything you have seen here has been an illusion.' Perhaps, everything we have seen has been a wonderfully crafted illusion by Director and Writer Neil Burger. Based on the short story by Steven Millhauser, 'The Illusionist' is a tale ultimately about love, honor, and magic. This is a stark contrast to the other magicians' movie, 'The Prestige' which is about the cost of fame and all consuming obsession. Edward Norton's powerful performance as illusionist Eisenheim, who pursues love and honor, inspires and compels in 'The Illusionist'. From that point of view, I enjoyed 'The Illusionist' more. 'The Illusionist' is an impassioned and timeless love story set in the world of magic of the late nineteenth century.Before becoming Eisenheim the Illusionist, Edward became entranced with magic as a young boy. Edward's first love is Sophie. However, social privilege keeps them apart. Edward is from a poor family. Sophie is a young Duchess. Edward designs a keepsake of his love for Sophie, which she wears. Unfortunately, Edward is forced to leave to protect himself and his family.Edward returns to Vienna as Eisenheim 15 years later. He is an accomplished magician of great talent. He rediscovers the love of his life Sophie (beautiful Jessica Biel) is still in Vienna, and about to be engaged to Prince Leopold (noble and unsavory Rufus Sewell). This arranged family marriage is purely for political leverage. Eisenheim has always loved Sophie, and she has always loved him. The suspicious and paranoid Leopold tasks his Chief Inspector Uhl (Giamatti) with uncovering Eisenheim's secretsÂ—magic and personal. Uhl fancies himself as a magic amateur and fan. The magic performed in 'The Illusionist' is spectacular. My bud Tom, who is an accomplished magician and student of the art, told me that these are classic magic tricks dating way back. So there is great authenticity and atmosphere to Burger's 'The Illusionist'. His final twist is more redemption, than merely shock.The performances are impeccable. Edward Norton has this sublime power on screen as Eisenheim. He is a commanding presence, who is never over done. He brilliantly balances both compassion and angst. He breathes refreshing nobility within his character. Paul Giamatti is awesome. In a sense 'The Illusionist' works, because of his believable performance as Inspector Uhl. This is particularly true in the amazing scene toward the end. Giamatti, always so natural, embodies such humanity. Jessica Biel is a welcome surprise. She is stunningly beautiful, and possesses an underlying strength and vulnerability as Sophie. Neil Burger orchestrates 'The Illusionist' with masterful strokes. The storytelling is impassioned, stylish, and inspiring. 'The Illusionist' is a great movie.",10,2,3,29 October 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Silver Surfer Rules
","When the Human Torch, Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), first encounters the Silver Surfer he exclaims, 'Now that's cool!' Yes, the Silver Surfer is so cool. It's this light hearted spirit and sense of wonder that propel Director Tim Story's 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer'. 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a light year's improvement over the original 'Fantastic Four'. The Silver Surfer is the iconic figure that transcends to almost the spiritual in pop culture. Well, perhaps that is a bit much. Admittedly, the tale of the Silver Surfer is the stuff of classic mythology. Possessing the power to transform matter and energy in the cosmos at will, the Silver Surfer has few equals. Is the Surfer the World's destroyer or savior? As embodied by Doug Jones and voiced by Laurence Fishburne, the Silver Surfer is a mysterious paradox. The Surfer provokes unnatural disaster upon earth, and bares a calm and noble presence. The Fantastic Four seem no match for the powerful Silver Surfer. So what remains is distinguishing his intentions. The Silver Surfer ominously says, 'All that you know, is at an end.' This time around the storytelling by Don Payne, Mark Frost and John Turman is engaging, compelling, with a humorous feel for pop culture celebrity. 'Rise of the Silver Surfer' is also funny, in particular Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. As the story opens Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to marry Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) in what is tagged as the 'Wedding of the Century'. Theirs is a rock star's wedding. The Fantastic Four have attained rock star status. In fact Johnny (Evans) has incorporated the 4, and is even considering NASCAR-like sponsorship for their uniforms. In a hysterical touch Johnny's date confesses in an 'E!' carpet interview that dating the Human Torch requires 'Fire proof lingerie and a lot of aloe.' The Thing, Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), has settled into a stable relationship with Alica (Kerry Washington), who is blind.On the eve of the Richards Wedding, General Hager (Andre Braugher), enrolls Reed into discovering the source of a series of unnatural events taking place across the globe. Genius Reed soon deduces that source may be an anomaly of vast cosmic energy. Upon further examination: this propagating energy anomaly has left 7 destroyed worlds in its aftermath. The cosmic anomaly is the Silver Surfer, and he becomes an uninvited guest at Reed and Sue's wedding in New York. During Johnny's encounter with the powerful Silver Surfer something goes awry. In the meantime, arch nemesis Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) is resurrected. The Fantastic Four are coerced into an alliance with Victor to battle the Silver Surfer. Of course Victor can not be trusted.The compelling story is the Silver Surfer's. The Silver Surfer is the herald of Galactus, the Devourer of Worlds. The Surfer is bound by his word to Galactus. In a great scene with Sue, the Silver Surfer concedes, 'I have no choice.' What choice does the honorable and benevolent Surfer have, being that he has given his word to serve the malevolent Galactus? This is a hero's conflict with no easy resolve. 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' is a great hero's story with engaging heroes. Chris Evans is awesome again as Johnny Storm. This time around he tempers his flip charm and flashy charisma, with his fear of ending up alone. Ioan Gruffudd has a newly commanding presence. He mutes some of the dorkiness of the character, and embodies leader. Jessica Alba, stunningly beautiful, to her credit plays Sue Storm straight and true to her character. Alba has an endearing vulnerability, and a surprising strength. Michael Chiklis is solid as Ben GrimmÂ—unfortunately his talents are not adequately leveraged. Doug Jones and Laurence Fishburne together bring the enigmatic Silver Surfer to life. The Silver Surfer is such a noble and charismatic force. And the Silver Surfer gives the movie its spirit. 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' is awesome summer entertainment.",9,4,9,19 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Nothing lasts... What a shame...
","'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is one year's best movies, although it runs a little long. Coming from Director David Fincher ('Seven' and 'Fight Club'), the movie is unexpectedly sentimental. Brad Pitt gives perhaps his best performance. Cate Blanchett is awesome, and deserves an Oscar nod. The screenplay by Eric Roth from the story by Robin Swincord and Roth based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald short story is the lyrical allegory of a man who ages backward through his life. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' feels reminiscent of Pitt's 'Meet Joe Black' and 'Forrest Gump'. This may be intentional. I am guessing that the original F. Scott Fitzgerald story may have been darker.Fincher envisions 'Benjamin Button' as a poignant parable of change in life, and life being whole and complete. The old woman, who teaches Benjamin to play piano, tells him, 'Everyone you love will eventually die' I think Fincher and Roth tell a story of legacy, mortality, and love. Effectively told from retrospective narrative, the story follows the life of Benjamin (Pitt), who is born an old man, and grows physically younger as he ages through his life. After giving birth to Benjamin in 1918, his mother dies. His abhorred father Thomas Button (good Jason Flemyng) abandons his son at an elderly care home.The baby is raised by strong young Black woman Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), who names her son Benjamin. This is an amazing narrative touch, as 'old man' baby Benjamin is raised among the elderlyhis people. There Benjamin meets the love of his life Daisy (who eventually grows into Cate Blanchett) when she is 7 years old. Here Fincher and Roth display a delicate touch. Benjamin and Daisy's fostering relationship is endearing and awkward, when it could easily have been a little creepy. At 17 years old Benjamin decides to leave home and sail the seas with tugboat skipper Captain Mike (larger than life Jarred Harris). All the while Benjamin writes to Daisy as he promised. Daisy grows up into a beautiful free-spirited ballerina.Eventually, their lives collide somewhere in the middle. In a moving scene together Benjamin confesses to Daisy, 'I was thinking how nothing lasts, and what a shame that is.' And we watch as Benjamin and Daisy deal with their fate and the inevitable. Along the way, life happens. Henson is so strong as Queenie, who loves Benjamin as her blood. There is such a moving moment at Benjamin's father's funeral. Queenie holding Benjamin's arm tells him that his father will be buried next to his mother. Pitt quietly says, 'You're my mother.' 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is about the fleetness of life and mortality, but is also about family and love spanning the generations. Along that line Julia Ormond is amazingly poignant as Daisy's daughter Caroline, who discovers her mother's amazing life. Tilda Swinton is also riveting as Elizabeth, the other great love of Benjamin's life.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' is so moving, because of the powerful performances from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Brad gives his best performance. He brilliantly balances the wonder and pain of a man fated to live his life backward. His chemistry with Blanchett is authentically moving and touching. Pitt and Blanchett make us believe that Benjamin and Daisy are soul mates. Blanchett is amazing, and deserves an Oscar nod. Although she plays the normal Daisy, who grows old like the rest of us, she emanates a deep compassion and humanity that is so moving. She is great with Pitt as their love story blossoms in the middle. Blanchett is powerful in her compassion and silence in the moments near the end.'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' celebrates life, unexpected and always a wonder. David Fincher maintains a sense of humor, and tells a touching and inspiring tale with an edge. Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett are amazing and powerful. See 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'.",10,0,0,31 December 2008
Coco," Remember us...
","Yeah, Pixar returns to telling classic stories of family and love in animated 'Coco'. Directors Adrian Molina and Lee Unkrich's 'Coco' surprise with their story surrounding The Day of the Dead â€“ Dia de Los Muertos. Vibrant images and colors amaze with texture and wonder. 'Coco''s state-of-the art CGI visuals alone astound. Yet, its big heart lies in the story. Molina and Matthew Aldrich's screenplay resonates forgiveness and remembrance. When Anthony Gonzalez, who voices Miguel, sings 'Remember Me' near the end tears shall fall. The stories and memories of those we love define legacy. That makes 'Coco' so special. Miguel's Great Great Grandfather abandoned his family to pursue his dream of becoming a musician. His great Great Great Grandmother voided the memory of her husband in photos and life, creating the family shoemaking business in his absence. She condemned all music for the family. Coco is Miguel's wheelchair bound Great Grandmother, who seems to remember very little, much less her Father. However, 10 year-old Miguel has no interest in the family business. Secretly he is the singer songwriter, who plays guitar much like his Great Great Grandfather. His dream is to perform music like his hero Ernesto de la Cruz, voiced by proud Benjamin Bratt. His music inspires Miguel. On Dia de Los Muertos the spirits of deceased family members visit their homes in the real world. These spirits who look like luminescent skeletons cross over the autumn leave covered bridge between our world and the Dead. Rather unnerving and creepy at first, this soon passes. Those forgotten in the real world become 'truly' Dead. In 'Coco' Miguel crosses over to the world of the Dead when he steals Ernesto's legendary guitar. He needs to find Ernesto, who might be family. If Miguel fails to return by next sunrise he shall remain there forever. Surprisingly the world of the Dead is filled with multicolored lights and life. The sights and music of 'Coco' delight.On Miguel's journey to find Ernesto, he meets his deceased relatives including his Great Great Grandmother, who outlawed all music in the family. Miguel befriends musician Hector, voiced by whimsical compassionate Gael Garcia Bernal. As a friend of Ernesto, Hector promises to help Miguel meet him at his annual concert. Directors Molina and Unkrich create the touching bond between the two. Hector inspires Miguel to find his unique voice. While Miguel gives Hector the faith of family.In Great Great Grandmother's epiphany, she may not forgive her husband for forsaking her and their daughter to pursue his love of music. Yet she remembers him, and remembers their love. In a sense remembrance allows for forgiveness. At times 'Coco' is loud pretty eye candy as it succumbs to the simple seek and find narrative. But the surprise reveals what you kind of know half way through. Miguel discovers his legacy and the family who loves him. Those who come before us are the possibility of love and becoming greater than we know. 'Coco' touched my heart. Life is about love and family.",9,2,5,4 December 2017
Million Dollar Baby," One in a Million
","Director Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' is truly a moving and touching motion picture. Powerful. This power derives from amazing actors, an unflinching and uncompromising screenplay by Paul Haggis, and a master director at the zenith of his power. This is the best movie of the year, and Eastwood's finest work. His gift for simplicity and eloquence is absolutely stunning. In writing this comment and acknowledgment, there is apprehension that I may be missing the same respect and integrity that Eastwood has for his audience. The controversial attention given to the story line, which I will not dwell upon, is warranted-- I suppose. Ultimately, it is a matter of choice. And ultimately, regardless of the power of a movie, it is still a movie. That being said, Hilary Swank who inhabits the role of Maggie Fritzgerald, is my favorite all-time movie hero. Her Maggie has such an earnestness, a purity of heart, and spirit that are awe inspiring. Maggie goes after what she wants with everything she's got. Swank truly gives life and soul to Haggis's words and Eastwood's direction. Swank, aside from undergoing hard physical training to bring tough as nails Boxer Maggie to life, also tempers her with a genuine charm, especially when she breaks out a tiny smile that warms your heart. Swank deserves an Oscar for her performance.Maggie is trailer trash, and she knows it. She has a fierce intelligence, and black and white sense. She sees being a professional boxer as her only way to make it. Thus, she saves all the money she makes as a waitress, so she can be trained by legendary cut man and trainer, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood). At first Frankie dismisses Maggie. Maggie is 31 years old, too old. It takes four years just to train a fighter, and she can't even hit a speed bag. Then Maggie tells him, if she can't make it as a boxer '...I may as well get a trailer home. Buy a deep fryer, and bag of Oreoes.' That catches our attention much like Frankie's. He takes her on as his charge. Haggis's screenplay based on the stories by F.X. Poole has a stark and authentic quality and consistency that are admirable.Morgan Freeman as Scraps Dupris is the conscience of 'Million Dollar Baby', and also it's narrator-- the reason later revealed. Scraps works for Frankie in his Gym. Scraps was a contender years ago. Frankie blames himself for a fight in which Scraps lost the use of his eye. Scraps is the one who first brings Maggie to Frankie's attention. Freeman is a great actor, one never catches him acting. His performance is commanding in it's understated nature. There is a breathtaking scene in the diner, where Scraps tells Maggie how he lost his eye in the fight. He (Freeman) is just talking, and Maggie (Swank) is just listening-- really listening. This is stripped down Eastwood at his best.Actor Clint Eastwood as trainer Frankie Dunn gives a compelling performance displaying such an ease, strength, and vulnerability. Eastwood is still evolving as an actor. His Frankie has an incomplete relationship with an unseen and estranged daughter. Thus, his relationship with Maggie makes sense. They fill in a missing in each other's life. Eastwood possesses this powerful silent presence, that few actors have. In a scene where Maggie is devastated when her Mom ( an effective Margo Martindale) rejects the house that Maggie bought for her, because this would cut off her Mom's welfare check, Eastwood stands silently outside the doorway. Nothing need be said. On the drive back, Maggie says quietly, 'Frankie, you're all I've got.' He replies 'You've got me.' The chemistry between Eastwood and Swank is magical, and what makes 'Million Dollar Baby' so special and compelling.The movie ends quietly, and is absolutely moving. And the audience is also silent. Eastwood's vision always has an authenticity about it. He always respects the intelligence of his audience, and our ability to make our own choices and judgments. I truly applaud all the effort and talent involved in making 'Million Dollar Baby'. I think Eastwood's movie captures all that is courageous, compassionate, and noble.",10,3,6,4 February 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Reminder of the Times
","In 'Good Night, and Good Luck', Edward R. Murrow says: 'We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason if we dig deep in our history and doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men, not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes which were for the moment unpopular. We can deny our heritage and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of the Republic to abdicate his responsibility.' In Director George Clooney's film set in 1958 following the end of the Joseph McCarthy hearings, Murrow's words still hold power for us as a reminder of our responsibility and due diligence as champions of freedom. The virtue of freedom is sacred in the world conflict balancing global terrorism and innate patriotism. Sometimes lines are crossed. Clooney's 'Good Night, and Good Luck' with the powerful David Strathairn as Murrow is the amazing story of the fight for freedom and conscience when this line is crossed. The screenplay by Clooney and Grant Heslov follows CBS news anchor Edward R. Murrow's confrontation with Senator Joseph McCarthy which eventually led to McCarthy's censure. McCarthy 1950's reign of terror leveraging guilt by association (to Communists) is part of American history, and a cautionary tale to future generations.During a news story meeting in 1953, Murrow (Strathairn) tells news director Fred Friendly (George Clooney) that in Detroit, Lt. Radulovich was dismissed from the Army because of a relations' tie to a Communist group, done without any apparent due process. Friendly reminds Murrow that if they run with the story they would bring upon themselves huge political consequences, and financial burden upon CBS. This does not escape Network President William Paley (Frank Langella). Murrow and Friendly are aware that their search to uncover the truth makes them McCarthy targets. Murrow broadcasts the story. Langella embodies a quiet strength and gravity as Paley, who defends freedom of speech and reminds Murrow and Friendly that their broadcasts will cost CBS valuable sponsor dollars. He also points out to Murrow that even he consciously tempers his own righteousness. Strathairn's Murrow must choose whether he is going to be a martyr for the cause or be the cause itself. Strathairn is powerful and compelling as Murrow becomes the later. Strathairn brings such an integrity and compassion in a delicately restrained performance. Here less is powerful. When one of his team bows out of the story because his ex attended 'communists' meetings, Murrow says: 'If none of us ever read a book that was 'dangerous,' nor had a friend who was 'different,' or never joined an organization that advocated 'change,' we would all be just the kind of people Joe McCarthy wants.' Clooney is awesome as Friendly. He brings a conviction and strength of character to Friendly that never overshadows Strathairn's Murrow. His is a perfectly nuanced partnership.As director, George Clooney is an amazing and gifted storyteller. His style is clean, clear, and passionate. If there is one thing that is perhaps missing that would be any insight into Murrow the man, his personal life, aside from news anchor. Clooney lends a personal touch with the story of Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson). Both do an amazing job, though following Murrow home from the newsroom would have been compelling. Clooney along with his co-writer Heslov brilliantly employ a retrospective story structure, so our eye is not so much on the outcome rather on the journey. Clooney elicits great performances from his talented cast that includes Langella, Jeff Daniels, Downey, Clarkson, along with Strathairn. 'Good Night, and Good Luck' is one of the year's best that reminds us of our responsibility to defend freedom in the most trying of timeswhich may be today.",10,1,2,4 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The Force in the Balance
","I loved 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. 'The Last Jedi' is about redemption. Also Writer and Director Rian Johnson's 'Last Jedi' redeems this 'Star Wars' trilogy. Unlike its predecessor 'The Force Awakens', 'The Last Jedi' is original narrative and tone, surprising in a great way. Daisy Ridley as Rey and Mark Hamill as her Jedi Master Luke Skywalker are awesome. Johnson eloquently deepens his characters in the story long, long ago in the galaxy far, far away. Adam Driver is welcome strength returning as the Dark Side Force's Kylo Ren. At its very best 'The Last Jedi' is about the lightness in dark, darkness in light. The compelling central triangle of the mythical Force is Rey, Luke, and Ren. Not to mention the visuals of galactic battles and red salt covered worlds astounds. Yet, the Hero story resonates. The Forces of good and evil are in the eyes of the beholder. The hero must ultimately choose. Discovering Luke on the island of the remote world, Rey tearfully pleads with 'The Last Jedi', 'I need someone to show me my place in all of this.' Hamill's Luke is not the familiar hero Skywalker we have come to know. His self banishment hides the great secret. Rey wants to define herself, fill the part that is missing. I think Luke fears that he may fail Rey, as he did with Kylo Ren. Ren is the son of Resistance General Leia, played with touching gravitas by the late Carrie Fisher. In 'The Force Awakens' Ren murdered his very Father Han Solo, conflicted within the Dark Side of the Force. Ren serves the powerful Dark Side Leader Snoke, played by malevolent Andy Serkis. Are salvation and redemption possible for Luke and Ren? Does the Jedi - the Hero emerge from within Rey? In one of my favorite scenes Luke converses with an 'old friend'. They speak of others becoming greater than. They speak poignantly of Master and Student. The Student doesn't fail his or her master. The Master can fail his or her student. That is Luke's regret for Ren, who chose the Dark path. There is no light or dark in the Force. 'The Last Jedi' explores balance of lightness and darkness in the Force. This Yin and Yang of 'Star Wars'. In the journey of lightness and darkness Daisy Ridley is amazing. As Rey she transcends as the hero, whose courage and compassion inspires others to be greater. Hamill gives his best performance as older tortured Luke. His Luke is wise, strength and frailty with the endearing sense of humor. Writer Johnson daringly infuses the lightness of a sense of humor in the darker narrative. The other narrative threads are often perfunctory in the subplot with Resistance fighters Finn, played by solid John Boyega, Poe Dameron, played by intrepid Oscar Isaac, and Rose, played by stellar newcomer Kelly Marie Tran, attempting to obtain secret codes to disable the First Order's battle ship fleet. The X-wing and Tie-fighter battles are spectacular in Dolby and Digital imagery. Although in the grand scheme, this distracts away from Rey, Luke and Ren's story. Heroes inspire others to be greater. I think that is what 'The Last Jedi' does best. Also life or the galaxy is neither all light nor all dark. We must reconcile that in our own worlds as well. The Force or the truth lies in the balance of lightness and darkness. Rian Johnson wisely enrolls us to choose. Ridley's brave Rey inspires, believing that in the balance we all become greater.",10,4,17,18 December 2017
Shrek 2," Ogres Ever After
","'Shrek 2' directed by Andrew Adamson (who also did Shrek), Kelly Asbury, and Conrad Vernon (the Gingerbread Man) continues the Ogre fairy tale after happily ever after as the couple, Shrek (Mike Meyers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz), visit the in-laws in Far Away Kingdom, the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews).  Shrek 2 is a great movie, almost as good as Shrek, and definitely funnier.  Shrek caught one by surprise the first time around, in that it was a satire of fairy tales, but underlying it was a very touching story about valuing people... and Ogres for their heart and character, in spite of appearance.  That unexpected quality can not be recreated; however, Shrek 2 has a touching quality, and the surprise quality of the first movie is replaced by hilarious pop culture digs, and the introduction of new characters, Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) and Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders).  Shrek was based on a book by William Steig, who co-wrote the screenplay for 'Shrek'.  Here in 'Shrek 2', J. David Stein, Joe Stillman, and David N. Weiss wrote the story for the Big Green Guy. So this kind of explains the difference in tone, though the quality remains excellent.  Shrek and Fiona along with Donkey (the hilarious Eddie Murphy) travel to visit Fiona's parents in Far Away which looks amazing like Beverly Hills-- a great joke. The King and Queen meet their new Ogre-In-Law, Shrek, and much to their dismay their daughter too is now an ogre.  They both had such high aspirations for Fiona to marry Prince Charming (the wonderfully prissy Rupert Everett).  Apparently, Shrek beat out Charming in Shrek 1, by rescuing Fiona from the Dragon's castle first.  Charming's mother also happens to be the Fairy Godmother.  That is the 'evil' Fairy Godmother, who schemes to have her son marry Fiona.  The King is particularly displeased with Shrek, and enlists the aid of Puss-In-Boots (Banderas), the Zorro-like kitty.  Shrek 2 moves a little slowly initially in the set up.  Once Puss In Boots joins Shrek and Donkey, and threatening Donkey's sidekick status the movie becomes a laugh riot.  The one constant amidst the gags and jokes is that Shrek loves Fiona and only wishes to make her happy.  This gives the movie it's heart.  The gags are laugh until you die funny.  This includes a satire of 'Cops' called 'Knights', a spoof of the Stay Puff Marshmellow Man from 'Ghost Busters', and the numerous pokes at Disney.  In one scene Fairy Godmother tells our hero, Shrek, 'Snow White-- No ogres.  Cindrella-- No ogres... Pretty Woman-- No ogres!'  Antonio Banderas as Puss practically steals the movie, especially with his effective 'fighting technique'. Jennifer Saunders as Fairy Godmother is awesome as the evil and scheming fairy.  The returning Mike Meyers, Cameron Diaz, and Eddie Murphy reprising their voices to characters we know and love, are fabulous.  Diaz carries off the 'straight man' Princess amazingly.  She definitely has a challenging role, given the comic genius of both Meyers and Murphy.  To his credit Meyers textures the gruff Shrek, with a surprising charm and sweetness.  Murphy as Donkey is always on the verge of being completely annoying and outrageous, but never crosses that threshold and remains always lovable.  The three actors are very comfortable voicing characters we have become very fond of. We look forward to seeing where their lives pick up in 'Shrek 3'.  Shrek 2 is a lot of fun, and the Ogres live happily ever after... at least for now.",10,0,1,13 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Samurai with an Edge
","According to Master Sword-Maker, Hattori Hanzo, in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1':'Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest. And like a forest, it's easy to lose your way... to get lost... to forget where you came in.'This pretty much embodies Director/Writer Quentin Tarantino's whacked, edgy, adrenadalized, and exquisitely crafted 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1'. It is one of the best movies of the year, and by far the year's Coolest Movie. Like the quote from Hanzo (played by the great action star/ martial artist Sonny Chiba), 'Kill Bill' is singular in purpose: a vengeance tale with a stylized narrative which includes some awesome use of Anime. Tarantino is in masterful form with his trademark expletive alliterated dialog, and over the top whacked sense of humor. This is genius, given the Bushido virtues of Justice, Courage, Benevolence, Honor, and Loyalty ['Bushido', Inazo Nitobe]. Sense of Humor is NOT one of the distinguished virtues. Therefore, having one is good for us in Vol. 1. Tarantino did his homework on Bushido (The Way of the Samurai). Inherent in the Samurai culture (and Japanese culture) is the dichotomy between exquisite beauty and extreme dispassionate brutality. Tarantino nails this in Vol. 1. In a movie scene O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) wearing an impeccable white kimono, recites a haiku in the middle of a snow covered garden before a fight to the death with The Bride (Uma Thurman). This is simply mesmerizing.In Vol. 1, The Bride (amazing Uma Thurman) embarks on her path of vengeance. The joke is that we really don't know her name-- Director's choice. She has one over on Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone movies. The Bride was a member of an elite group of assassins all working for the mysterious Bill (an unseen David Caradine). However, when she decides to leave, her crew (Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox) put the hit on the pregnant Bride, and her husband at the wedding in an El Paso church. The Bride (Thurman) miraculously survives, and is in a coma for 4 years. Upon awakening from the coma, The Bride, vows to call it 'square'. A critical element in her path of vengeance is finding Hattori Hanzo (Chiba) to make her the classic katana to dispatch those who betrayed her.Tarantino's 'Bill' is an homage to classic samurai movies and westerns, and at it's heart is Uma Thurman. Uma Thurman is awesome. Her character is strong, smart, and singular in focus-- the ultimate in single tasking. She also has a wicked wry sense of humor in her delivery. She is so good at masking any of her character's vulnerability; thus, making her empathetic. The scene where she awakes from her coma is both hysterical and chilling. She looks great, and is in great shape. Her fighting scenes are Bushido. She fights with expedience, precision, and dispassion. There is an obscene beauty in dispatching one's opponent with a single strike. It's great to see Sonny Chiba as Hanzo-- the spiritual anchor. Perhaps in Vol. 2 he will display his technical prowess? Lucy Liu as the half breed Japanese O-Ren Ishii, Yakuza Leader, is stunning. Liu delicately balances bi-polar Ishii's beauty and ruthlessness. Liu has a classic scene in which one of her subordinates questions her leadership, because she is an American and... half Chinese. Again, Tarantino did his homework. The fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii will be a movie classic, much like Thurman's astonishing battle with Ishii's henchmen. The joke seems to be that The Bride is really learning to use the katana, so she sometimes holds the sword like a baseball bat. However, in battle she uses the more classic form.Props to Tarantino, Thurman, Liu, Chiba, and Fox on killer movie. This is the year's best. Really. 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is the zenith of pop culture movie-making. Can't wait until Vol. 2 in February.",10,0,1,12 October 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A lot of Tim Burton
","A little of Tim Burton goes a long way. In his 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' there is a lot of Director Tim Burton. There are about two too many Oompa Loompa song and dance numbers-- which have the analogous effect of riding Disneyland's 'It's a Small World' in rapid succession. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is dark, macabre, absurd, and wacky. Talking with my bud, Ron, who is a fan of the Roald Dahl novel, Burton navigates closely by the book, a lot in spirit. John August's adaptation of the novel, is strange and at times overly stilted-- the children other than Charlie (wonderfully embodied by Freddie Highmore) are dreadful and for the most part despicable. Eventually August veers back toward the conventional ending, which worked for me at least. Johnny Depp's character turn near the end as Willy Wonka also returns us to the world of human beings. Charlie Bucket (Highmore) catches Willy Wonka's attention saying, 'Candy doesn't have a point. That's what makes it candy.' However, a movie should have a point, even if it is about that childhood romantic quality. With Highmore's Charlie we get that, and the value of family.Depp steers the course on this very weird journey. In the beginning, I did not know what to make of Depp's Wonka. He seems to be doing a walk-through, playing a caricature of Michael Jackson sans the problematic legal creepiness. His Wonka is basically Peter Pan, who has an incomplete and unresolved relationship with his dentist father, Dr. Wonka (well played by Christopher Lee). Willy Wonka, chocolate magnate, being the son of a dentist is a great touch by August. Wonka's flashbacks to his youth are absurd, and Depp balances all this playing it straight up. Only at the end does he reveal Wonka's human vulnerability, with a light touch and wacky edge. Depp is an amazing and versatile actor.I was interested in Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', because it reunited Depp and Highmore. They had magical chemistry in 'Finding Neverland'. 'Finding Neverland' is an entirely different kind of movie; however, they are also wonderful here. Highmore's Charlie Bucket lives in a broken down home with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Tayllor), and both sets of grandparents. They are poor, and they are happy together. Willy Wonka announces to the world that he will open his world famous Chocolate Factory for a personal tour to the lucky five people who find a golden ticket hidden in the wrapper of his chocolate bars. Charlie finds the last ticket, and he and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) are among those to meet Willy Wonka. The other kids are despicable and annoying, and their parents are even more so. Perhaps, that is a message. This may almost be a miscalculation given the contest subtext of the story. All the other kids are so bad, and Charlie is a really good kid. Burton provides a visually stunning fantasy world inside the Chocolate Factory, even if there are two too many Oompa Loompa numbers. None the less, it is worth sticking out the over-the-top Burton for the end.Freddie Highmore is an awesome young actor. He has a charm, earnestness, and warmth that are unmatched by many mature actors. When he is with Depp, the movie is amazing. Burton could have done more of this, instead of indulging in the bizarre and absurd. Then again, that is not in his nature. He is a skillful and eclectic director. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is worth seeing.",8,0,1,13 August 2005
Black Hawk Down," Sound and Fury...
","Ridley Scott's 'Black Hawk Down' is masterful technical work that depicts the cost of war, and the honor of the soldier, though it so full of sound and fury for the first hour that it blurs it's own message. Elite Ranger and Delta Force troops drop into Somalia on what is supposed to be a short mission to capture the two lieutenants of a warlord. Based on the book by Mark Bowden from the actual event in 1993, the screenplay by Ken Nolan and Steve Zallian is very confusing in the beginning, and it gets it's bearing toward the end of the movie. There is a large and talented cast with standout performances from Josh Hartnet as Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann, Eric Bana as the warrior, Sgt. 'Hoot', and Tom Sizemore as Lt. Col. Danny McKnight. Some of the confusion comes from having such a large ensemble cast-- some of the characters are indistinguishable, along with the intentional chaos on Director Scott's part as he depicts the initial mission going awry as Eversmann's men drop into Mogadeshu. The violence is realistic and uncompromising in the beginning, though it lacks the strong narrative style of 'Saving Private Ryan'. What 'Black Hawk Down' does well is make the viewer uncomfortable. In war the cost are the lives of young men. Bringing back everyone from battle is the highest tribute in the honor of the soldier. Eric Bana's 'Hoot' says it all when he tells Harnet, 'It's all about the guy next to you...' That is inspiring. 'Black Hawk Down' gets it right in the end.",8,0,0,18 February 2002
The Hangover Part II," You know the drill...
","In 'The Hangover Part II' Stu (Ed Helms) with freshly emblazoned Mike Tyson facial tattoo, has an epiphany, 'Oh my G**! We kidnapped a monk!' 'The Hangover Part II' is awesome. The movie is hysterical. Director and Writer Todd Phillips perhaps made the movie he intended to make with 'The Hangover'. Now instead of Las Vegas, the Wolf Pack find themselves in Bangkok, Thailand, where there are no comedic restraints. Scary thought. Phillips with writers Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong brilliantly blur lines of taste with unnerving sense of humor. I read several reviews panning 'The Hangover 2' as a glossy clone, more than a sequel. Where the characters and story by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore were novel and clever, this one is formulaic, but punctures the envelope and is wildly funny. This is an authentic sequel in that a lot of the humor derives from the original.A lot is familiar. Instead of the baby and the tiger, we have the Zen Buddhist Monk, who has taken a vow of silence, and the drug dealing monkey that smokes. Stu (Helms) again falls for the stripper, this time beautiful Kimmy (stunning Yasmin Lee). However, about 2 minutes into the scene with Stu and Kimmy, as Stu attempts to reassemble his missing day, we get the ominous hysterical punch line. Phillips's genius is leading us down the familiar path, and then propels us beyond: where no one has gone before. Ken Jeong reprises as Mr. Chow--this time as part of the Wolf Pack. Before the collective brain freeze, Allan (goofy Zach Galifianakis) received a text from Chow, 'Let's party bitches.' Jeong could never top his naked crow bar moment, but he comes close and is hilarious. Yes, Mike Tyson is back, and actually surprises.Not surprisingly, as 'The Hangover Part II' opens frazzled Bradley Cooper as leader Phil, calls Tracy (gorgeous and intense Sasha Barrese), Doug's (Justin Bartha) wife. Phil confesses again, 'We really f***ed up this time' The crew was at an exclusive resort in Thailand, I'm thinking Phuket, for Stu's wedding. 2 years have passed, and Stu has found the love of his life in Lauren (beautiful and smart Jamie Chung). Phil, Stu, and Allan wake up in some seedy hotel in Bangkok. Stu has the Mike Tyson tattoo on the side of his face. Allan's head is shaved. There is monkey wearing a denim jacket. Lauren's brother Teddy (easy going Mason Lee) is missing. There is a detached finger with a Stanford ring—apparently Teddy's.The last thing the dudes remember was having a beer around the campfire bachelor party at the resort beach. Of course Allan vehemently claims ignorance. Making matters worse: Lauren's father Fohn (solid unforgiving Nirut Sirchanya) hates Stu with a passion. At the wedding rehearsal dinner he compares Stu to bland Thai rice porridge. Also protégé Teddy, Stanford premed at 16 years old, is the light of his life. Stu may never recover. With straight man Doug (Bartha) back at the resort, The Wolf Pack gradually reconstruct the day and search for Teddy. All looks lost. They must contend with mysterious businessman Kingsley (manic and funny Paul Giamatti) this time around. High jinks accelerate with Russian mobsters, Buddhist monastery, and raunchy strip clubs.The upside and downside of 'The Hangover Part II' is familiarity. Mostly upside. Granted it is predictable in the endgame. The rest is wicked chaotic genius. It is all about the fuzzy journey. Bradley Cooper is the strong lead. He is movie star handsome and the anchor in this raucous comedy. As the great comic reactor, he makes '2' work again. He is not asked to be funny; he is charmingly fun. Ed Helms is brilliant as the butt of the jokes, and he does this with natural grace. Zach Galifianakis returns annoyingly as dysfunctional Allan. We can never tell whether Allan is an idiot savant or just an idiot. Galifianakis is unwavering in Allan's self awareness void. However, he gives Allan a good heart, albeit misguided. Ultimately, brotherhood and friendship underlies and comes full circle in 'The Hangover 2', much like 'The Hangover'. So despite the guys getting the crap beat out of them by a staff wielding monk; we pull for them, because they pull for each other.'The Hangover Part 2' is a great looking movie as well. The opening shots of the mountainous islands in the seas around Thailand are breathtaking. The resort and beaches are beautiful. This is also offset by the dichotomy of Bangkok. We see the clustered streets of the clubs and vendors balances against the stunning skyline view of a luxury hotel tower. My bud Robert, visual effects supervisor, seamlessly made the monkey smoke cigarettes, among numerous other effects.'The Hangover Part II' is the funniest movie of the year. You know the drill: Stay through the end credits. Can't figure out how Phillips makes a sequel, given that Allan is the only one not married. I'm sure they figure this out. And look forward to seeing that one as well—the upside of familiarity.",10,5,13,30 May 2011
Prisoners," Forgive Us Our Trespasses
","Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal are absolutely powerful in Director Denis Villeneuve's dark and mesmerizing 'Prisoners'. 'Prisoners' has the look and resonance of Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River'. This haunting morality play is one of best movies of the year. Jackman gives perhaps his best and most unexpected performance. Jackman's sheer ferocity in the tipping point of human conscience is amazing to behold. His bold vulnerability clutches our very soul. This is equally surprising given his signature as the Wolverine. I literally cringed as he threatens terrified Paul Dano as Alex with a steel hammer. In stark contrast there is a quiet scene as tears stream down his cheek as he stares at police photos. Gyllenhaal as Jackman's antagonist foil is an undeniable force. Much like Kevin Bacon in 'Mystic River' Gyllenhaal's Detective Loki struggles between duty and the visceral justice. Villeneuve and Writer Guzikowski curiously never spell out Loki's physical glitches neither the gang banger tattoos. Have to admire them for respecting audience intelligence. Gyllenhaal's immersion is breathtaking whether he is comforting Viola Davis's Nancy about her missing daughter or smashing the head of suspect on a table. His screen partnership with Jackman is awesome, we witness amazing actors at the zenith of their prowess. Villeneuve is brilliant in restraining and balancing such intense performances without sacrificing purpose. We first hear Jackman's voice as Keller Dover reciting The Lord's Prayer on a deer hunting trip with his son Ralph (Dylan Minnette, who is going to surprise many). Keller is a struggling carpenter, and closet survivalist. He is a family man and man of faith. Aaron Guzikowski's story's deceptive power lies in the normalcy of a Pennsylvania suburb. He foreshadows the tragic forfeit as the ends overcome the means. Roger Deakins's ('True Grit') cinematography is a profound character onto itself bestowing pristine clarity in this conflict of dark and gray. The Dovers' spend Thanksgiving with Frank and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis). The terrifying realization sets in that their youngest daughters Anna (Erin Gerasimovich) and Joy (Kyla Drew Simmons) are missing. After frantic search in the rain, Police are called. A creepy suspect Alex Jones (brilliantly unnerving Paul Dano) emerges as the possible kidnapper. Alex also has the mind of a 10 year old. Alex is released without any solid evidence. However, Keller is convinced from an admission by Alex, that he knows where his daughter Anna is. He takes matters into his own, and imprisons Alex and tortures him until he tells him what he wants. Howard's Franklin is mortified by Keller's actions. Keller says, 'Someone had to make him talk, or they're going to die!' Viola Davis as Nancy is rock solid in shocking advocacy. Mario Bello as Keller's wife Grace is sympathetic grace as a mother suffering the unthinkable. Melissa Leo is amazing as Holly Jones, Alex's Aunt and guardian. Her ordinary persona belies tragedy.All is not what seems. Keller and Loki have the same purpose in divergent paths, and make costly sacrifices. Villeneuve reminds that sometimes the world is ugly, and in resolution our souls are in the balance. Jackman and Gyllenhaal are awesome. The cast is amazing. 'Prisoner' is not a pleasant movie to watch--not at all. 'Prisoners' has profound power.",10,6,10,29 September 2013
Logan," Logan's Legacy
","'Logan' is the fierce and touching elegy of the hero's redemption. 'Logan' is amazing. The movie is bloody, inspired, and sublime. Hugh Jackman is powerful and nuanced. As the aging and fading Logan, Jackman remains the sinuous beast, but with boldly reinvented vulnerability. Newcomer Dafne Keen with her innocent wide eyes possesses the child's truth. She is a star. Director and writer James Mangold's hero's journey moves us, and will make you cry. I read an interview with Hugh about his last incarnation as Logan after being him for 17 years. He said that he will miss Logan as a best part of himself. Jackman is transcendent in 'Logan'. 'Logan' is set in 2029. Mutants like Logan are no longer—possibly having been exterminated in this future. Logan is aging and grayed; his powers are fading. He heals much slower—the bullets and his retracting Adamantium claws are bloody and hurt. He is no longer the hero he once was. He is a limo driver, who drinks way too much. Logan is dying, and faces his own mortality. He and his beloved mentor Charles, played by powerful Patrick Stewart, are among the remaining Mutants. 90-old Charles was the most powerful telepath is a hallowed shell, now bed ridden suffering mind altering seizures and dementia. Logan along with Mutant albino Caliban, played by compassionate Stephen Merchant, care for Charles. Perhaps, there is another Mutant still out there? Charles tells Logan that he is 'A disappointment...' Logan has lost his purpose. Logan struggles with who he has become—something I can empathize. 'Logan' opens in stark tone. Thugs wake sleeping Logan while stealing the rims from his limousine. The thieves dismiss his warnings. Though riddled with bullets, Logan slashes and maims with skilled savage rage. 'Logan' has the feel of 'The Road Warrior' or 'Unforgiven'. Mangold even does homage to 'Shane'. Those stories were about the redemption of the nihilist or anti-hero; however, Mangold's Logan profoundly fights for love. After having a beautiful dinner with a family they helped, Charles tells Logan, 'This is what life looks like'The hauntingly calm Pierce with eerie mechanical hand played by charismatic strong Boyd Holbrook, tracks down Logan in El Paso asking him for information about some 'missing property'. Pierce is an agent for Transigen Corporation that does unspeakable experimentation with Mutants. Logan has no idea, until she finds him.She is wide eyed and silent little girl Laura—the other Mutant. Logan and Charles must take Laura to North Dakota so that she can find sanctuary with other young Mutants across the border in Canada. Charles tells Logan, 'She's like you she's very much like you.' Pierce and his mercenaries are relentless and find Logan, Charles, and Laura at their refuge. Laura announces her presence unleashing her merciless fury upon her enemies. She has great agility and strength, also possessing Logan's Adamantium claws and warrior skills. Keen and Jackman are spectacular battling together against their underestimating opponents. Initially, Charles and Logan suspect Laura may be a clone of Logan. In an eloquent touch Logan discovers Laura is a fan of the 'X-Men' comics and Wolverine. He dismisses telling her most of the stories are 'bullsh**'. Meanwhile, a figure from the past Dr. Rice played by the reserved evil Richard E. Grant as the head of Transigen is about to unleash his most ferocious creation. Logan becomes Laura's protector; she is like family, like blood. She needs him to be her hero. Charles reminds Logan of what we already knew. His fading powers and claws aside, what makes Logan the hero, is the man he is. He just needs to remember that, and reclaim himself. This fight is different now: Logan fights for love. In 'Logan' the battles are fierce, vicious and costly. Before the climactic battle, Laura and Logan share. Logan says that everyone he ever loved gets hurt. He has hurt people. Laura says, 'I hurt people, too Bad people.' Logan confides, 'You are going to have to live with that, too.' Jackman and Keen are the beating hearts of 'Logan'. Jackman's Logan tragically weeps over his loss; Keen's Laura holds his bloody hand with her own. Keen's closing moments as little Laura speaks to our very humanity. Jackman as Logan poignantly says, 'So this is what it feels like' The hero deserves to find his own measure of peace and love at the end of his journey. We honor this as well, because we deserve the same. 'Logan' is the hero story of amazing grace and power. It is one of the best. Thank you, Hugh Jackman for being our hero.",10,3,8,6 March 2017
The Dark Knight," Amazing Dark Knight
","In a tragic juncture of 'The Dark Knight' Christian Bale's Batman says to his protector Alfred (Michael Caine), 'Alfred,...I meant to inspire good...' Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' is the best movie of the year, and may be the best movie of the last five years. The late Heath Ledger's chilling and mesmerizing performance as The Joker will win for Best Supporting Actor. However, I think Christian Bale as Batman and Bruce Wayne is amazingly powerful, deserving of acknowledgment. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay from the story by Chris Nolan and David Goyer is classic Greek tragedy transformed into modern superhero mythology at its most compelling.In 'The Dark Knight' the great villain, the Joker, relies upon the great hero, Batman. This battle of great evil against good is galvanized by Ledger and Bale. In one sense Ledger's performance is brilliant nihilist chaos, much like The Joker, who just 'wants to watch the world burn.' However, Bale as Bruce Wayne and Batman has limits. Bale's Bruce confesses, 'I've seen now what I have to become to stop men like him.' Bale is so riveting and powerful in the battle against succumbing to his own darkness, as a means to justice. In a poignant scene Bruce pleads, 'People are dying. What would you have me do?' Alfred (Caine) says, 'Endure' There are no trite answers or clean resolution in this morality play. 'The Dark Knight' is the uncompromising hero tale where the hero does the right and just thing, but no one escapes unscathed or goes on without forfeiting part of their soul.'The Dark Knight' is a classic morality play in the midst of a mystifying action movie. The action is visually astounding. Chris Nolan awes us with high speed chases, diesel truck flipping in midair, and dramatic showdowns with Batman and the Joker. Bale and Ledger are up to the physical challenges'The Dark Knight' has awe inspiring martial arts/ street fight sequences. This is Chris Nolan's modern heroic tragic masterpiece.As 'The Dark Knight' resumes, Gotham City is engulfed in a bloody organized crime gang war. Batman (Bale), The Dark Knight, is doing his valiant best as vigilante of justice. However, it seems that the result is an escalation of violence. Mob boss Salvatore Maroni (slick Eric Roberts) and his associates cut a deal with The Joker to 'Kill the Batman.' Bruce Wayne (Bale) and his Wayne Industries CEO (solid and cool Morgan Freeman) also suspect that potential Hong Kong partner Lau (Chin Han) is not what he says, and is tied to the conspiracy. Bruce is convinced that Gotham really needs a hero 'without a mask', and that would be newly elected DA Harvey Dent (charismatic and passionate Aaron Eckhart)The White Knight. Dent wants to bring down the mob, but he questions the leverage Lt. Gordon (amazing Gary Oldman) has with The Dark Knight. Bruce is also torn, because Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaall) is in love with Harvey (Eckhart). Rachel is the love of Bruce's life, for whom he would sacrifice all. Rachel cautions Bruce to not use her as a means for 'a normal life'. She also confides her soul to Alfred (Caine) regarding Bruce.The stage is set for the dramatic battle between good and evil, and more profoundly the ultimate cost and sacrifice. Here Nolan and Ledger provoke and thrill. Ledger's Joker is really not what he seemsa raving anarchist bent on chaos. His power and malevolence lies in his ability to leverage the weaknesses of his adversaries, regardless of their innate nobility. This is the source of The Dark Knight's tragedy and muted triumph. The performances are amazing. Morgan Freeman as Lucius is Bruce's trusted mentor and conscience. Michael Caine is quietly powerful as Alfred, guardian of Master Bruce's soul. He is awesome. Maggie Gyllenhaall has a strong turn as Rachel, who is caught between Bruce, Harvey, and Batman.'The Dark Knight' is Chris Nolan's triumph of heroic tragedy. His work is emotionally compelling and spellbinding, and visually astounding. 'The Dark Knight' is the best movie of the year, and the best movie of the last few years.",10,3,7,20 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The Good and Evil in Harry
","Director David Yates's 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' takes a distinctively dark turn, and is the most compelling of the Harry Potter movies. In 'Order of the Phoenix' the dark Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) returns, and the prophecy revealed regarding his bond to the emerging Harry (Daniel Radcliffe). Introspective and tortured Harry asks his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), ' What if I'm becoming bad?' Sirius Black reassures, 'You're a good person We all have both light and dark inside us. What matters is the power we choose to act on.' Harry sees own his darkness. 'Harry Potter' becomes classical hero mythology. Harry must use his powers for good and not evil, at the same time fearing that he maybe becoming that which he despises. In the prophecy either Harry or Voldermort will survivethere can be only one. Their destiny is intertwined and ultimately mysterious. During the climatic battle with Lord Voldermort Harry's mentor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tells Harry (Radcliffe), 'It's not so much how you are alike, but how much you are not...' 'Order of the Phoenix' is engrossing I suspect like the J.K. Rowling's book, because it is about the conflict of good and evil within Harry. As Harry, Daniel Radcliffe is powerful and commanding.I am not a 'Harry Potter' literatehave not read any of the books. Although, Michael Goldenberg's screenplay of the J.K. Rowling's book is articulate and coherentquickly resuming the story since last movieI had to defer to my bud Chuck for some Harry Potter 101. For example, in the opening I did not know what the soul-stealing creatures threatening Harry and his friend were. However, in evoking his powers against the creatures to protect a human or Muggle violates Wizard law. The Ministry means to expel Harry from Hogwarts for this breachwhich seems more of conspiracy. Hogwarts Headmaster Dumbledore (strong and wise Michael Gambon) defends Harry, and in the process reveals Lord Voldermort return. His possible return is dismissed vehemently by the Ministry. Harry is free to return for the school term at Hogwarts along with Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). Joining the School faculty is Dolores Umbridge (very good Imelda Staunton) as the new instructor of the Defensive Arts, who seems more interested in theory than practicing actual magic. Umbridge seems evil in that her world seems to reside entirely inside her head. Harry takes it upon himself at Hermione's prodding to instruct fellow students in the Defensive Arts (magic that can be used against the Dark Lord). Meanwhile, Harry enlists with his godfather Sirius Black (Oldman) and the Order of the Phoenix that originally formed to battle Lord Voldermort the first time around. Harry himself as a child survived a vicious attack from Voldermort, but now questions his prowess and virtue for their inevitable conflict. Desperate times require similar action as Harry is trained by the morally ambiguous Serves Snape (slithering Alan Rickman). There are several more story lines with the main focus on Harry and Voldermort. Rowling's story of choice conveys that in the darkest of times, true magic comes from love, courage, and community.The acting in 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' is impeccable starting with Daniel Radcliffe. Maturing Radcliffe brings an authentic teen angst to Harry. Radcliffe has a powerful and compassionate presence as the hero accepting his responsibility and destiny. He is also up to the challenge of Fiennes' menacing presence. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint seem to have reduced roles as Hermione and Ron with focus on Harry and Voldermort. Watson remains charming and radiant. Grint is becoming a talented comic actor. Michael Gambon is commanding as Dumbledore. It's great to see the venerable wizard in battle. Gary Oldman is charismatic and noble as Sirius Black. Ralph Fiennes may not be on the screen all that much as Voldermort, but his presence dominates 'Order of the Phoenix'. Fiennes embodies a visceral evil and evokes a powerful presence. He is awesome.Acknowledge David Yates and Michael Goldenberg for their captivating and visually stunning storytelling. I saw a digital projection of the movie that was spectacular. Theirs is a classic story of the battle against great evil, and the compelling internal conflict of good and evil within Harry himself. 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' has courageous heroes and powerful villains all in a great movie.",10,0,1,29 July 2007
Blood Diamond," When Good Men Act
","In the midst of civil war in Sierra Leone, South Africa ex-mercenary Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio) confesses to American reporter Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), 'God left this place (the world) a long time ago' DiCaprio is powerful and poignant. This is the unforgiving and savage world of Director Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond'. Writers Charles Leavitt and C. Gaby Mitchell tell the story of African 'conflict diamonds' that are brokered to Antwerp, Belgium stained with the blood of enslaved laborers, merciless gangs, and ruthless mercenaries.Maddy (Connelly) is in Sierra Leone to expose the diamond conspiracy that generates a glut of diamonds yet imposes a perceived scarcity that drives the market demand. Danny (DiCaprio) is her only credible inside source on the 'conflict diamond' market. Although mutually attracted to Maddy, Danny is invariably tied to Mende fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), who possesses the whereabouts of a rare and valuable pink diamond. Solomon escaped imprisonment in a diamond mine operation and is in search of his displaced family; including his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers), captured and trained by a violent gang. Initially, Danny's motives are driven by greed that transforms to heroic selflessness. Leonardo DiCaprio is mesmerizing and powerful in Danny's character arc. I never really got DiCaprio's star quality, until now. DiCaprio is older, filled out and decidedly manly as Danny. He brings such a passion and rugged intensity to the role. Also compelling is his chemistry with the strong Jennifer Connelly as Maddy, who believes in Danny's best. There is a touchingly eloquent scene with the two when Danny tells Maddy, 'You find yourself a good man' DiCaprio is powerful as a man flawed and ultimately a hero. Connelly is equally powerful, smart with great compassion. She is so compelling, particularly in her silence. Hounsou is truly a commanding force. He is electrifying as the courageous father seeking to reunite his stolen family. Hounsou captures the anguish and strength as the loving and dedicated father and husband.Edward Zwick ('The Last Samurai', 'Glory') is the masterful storyteller. Zwick along Leavitt and Mitchell give us a glimpse of poverty stricken Africa ruled by ruthless regimes where young men have their hands chopped to prevent them from voting. Lives are expendable. Diamonds are everything. Zwick also keeps the story moving with crisp action, and high drama. Unlike the confessed resignation of Danny that God left the world a long time ago, Zwick tells his story of good men who act. Leonardo DiCaprio's Danny and Hounsou's Solomon symbolize this. Reminiscent of 'Three Kings', the self interested Danny surrenders to his own nobility and grace. DiCaprio is so engaging and compellinghe gives his best performance. Jennifer Connelly is amazing, both radiant and powerful. Though in a supporting role, she grounds the movie. Her Maddy sees the greatness in Danny, and her faith is unyielding. 'Blood Diamond' concludes in great catharsis. Things don't always end as we wish. But the world is a greater place when good men choose to act out of conscience and valor. Zwick poignantly reminds of this in his 'Blood Diamond'. It is one of the year's best.",10,0,0,6 January 2007
Taken," Hero Focused
","In 'Taken' from a Paris apartment frightened Kim (Maggie Grace) describes the abduction of her best pal Amanda (Katie Cassidey) by Albanian human traffickers on her cell phone to her amazingly calm dad Bryan (Liam Neeson). Bryan advises his daughter to 'focus'. Kim hides under the bed, as her Dad advises. Then Neeson prepares Kim for worst, 'You are going to be taken' One of Kim and Amanda's abductors picks up her phone. Bryan in calm and measured voice tells him, 'I will look for you. I will find you. And I will kill you.' Bryan Mills has 'certain skills' as a retired CIA operative, who was a 'preventor of bad things.' From what we know of Bryan so far, we know that Bryan will keep his word.Director Pierre Morel's 'Taken' is singular and focused like his star Neeson, who is amazingly powerful and commanding as Bryan. Neeson brings such a visceral force of will that elevates what could have been an ordinary vengeance tale. Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen's screenplay enrolls us whole heartedly in Bryan's mission to get his daughter back and punish those responsible without mercy. What works is that Bryan's actions underlie his love for his daughter. Morel, Besson, and Kamen tell a compelling and classic hero story. Bryan is man of action and honors his word. And Bryan inspires others to step up, and become heroes. There is a great story arc with diva singer Sheerah (very good Holly Valance). Early on we witness Bryan's prowess as he dispatches Sheerah's attacker at a concert. Inspired by Bryan, Sheerah becomes a hero for another.'Taken' like its hero, is defined by action. The action is driving, brutal, and unrelenting. The gun scenes are spectacular. The fight scenes are amazing with slick martial arts flair incorporating such elements as kick-boxing and Aikido. Liam Neeson is fit and strong in delivering the violence and mayhem. Neeson is a powerful and compassionate presence. He brings a determined strength, wit, and force of will that distinguishes and gives 'Taken' its soul. All this makes 'Taken' so surprising and so satisfying.In 'Taken' Bryan has retired from the Agency to be closer to his estranged 17 year old daughter Kim (Grace). Bryan's estranged and suffering wife Lenore (beautiful and sullen Famke Janssen), has been remarried to wealthy businessman Stuart (solid Xander Berkeley). Stuart is the stepfather, who provides everything for Kim. Bryan reluctantly agrees to let Kim travel to Paris with her friend Amanda. Bryan knows first hand that the world can be a dangerous place.Albanian human traffickers abduct Kim and Amanda, and Bryan and Lenore learn from Bryan's agency expert Sam (good Leland Orser) that they have 96 hours to find Kim. The compelling narrative thread is that the people responsible don't get that Bryan intends to get his daughter and kill those responsible—that's it. At one story arc, one of the villains confesses, 'It wasn't personal.' Bryan says, 'It was all personal to me.' The hero keeps his word.Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen are strong and solid. It is Liam Neeson's charismatic and unnervingly calm presence that compels and inspires 'Taken'. 'Taken' is just a great hero story.",10,1,5,8 February 2009
Avatar," Hero's Transformation in 'Avatar'
","'Avatar' is like nothing you have seen before, and perhaps the signature of things to come. 'Avatar' is beautifully stunning. In one scene Na'vi Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) ride winged creatures as they careen through the Floating Mountains of Pandora. Breathtaking. I saw 'Avatar' in Real 3D, and it is spectacular and amazing. The visual 3D is seamless—'Avatar' is just a gorgeous movie to watch. Director and Writer James Cameron tells the story of the transformation of hero. As envisioned by Cameron, the hero Jake emerges out of his tribe and nature's cyber network. Grace (strong Sigourney Weaver) points out that the Na'vi are networked through the trees of Pandora; thus, having more connections than the human brain.'Avatar' is like American Indian mythology where the people see the value of harmony with the spirit of the land, and being protectors of it. Sam Worthington as Jake is compassionate and commanding in his journey of the hero. As in most classic stories, he is a reluctant hero at first. Beautiful and strong Na'vi Neytiri (Saldana) tells Jake's avatar after saving his life, 'You have a strong heart. Fearless And so stupid!' Jake (Worthington) is a paraplegic Marine in the year 2154 sent to Pandora to participate in an experiment. Jake replaces his twin brother, who was a scientist that had died, as Avatar for his Na'vi body. He along with lead scientist Grace (Weaver) become avatars for bodies grown from Na'vi and human DNA. The Na'vi are the tribal people that inhabit the planet Pandora which is light years from earth. Pandora possesses the mineral Unobtainium (kind of cheesy) that is worth millions of dollars on earth. The Na'vi live on a tree over the largest source of the precious ore. The Na'vi are blue skinned beautiful and sinuous people standing 10 feet tall. And according to Marine Col. Miles Quaritch (awesome Stephen Lang) the Na'vi also have carbon fiber skeletal structures which makes them 'very hard to kill'. Jake is part of the diplomatic solution. However, Quaritch enlists Jake as his Marine Na'vi to learn about the enemy and distinguish their weakness. In return Jake gets his legs back.Jake as Na'vi soon finds himself falling in love with the stunningly beautiful Neytiri (Saldana), daughter of Shaman Chief Eytukan (Wes Studi). Jake becomes Na'vi, and sees the value of this noble people, and their spiritual and physical bond to Pandora itself. So the Avatar of the cyber world must choose whether he becomes the Avatar, chosen one, of his new people. In this Cameron's storytelling is compelling. Worthington is strong and compassionate. Saldana is noble and vulnerable. Their chemistry is amazing as Jake confesses to Neytiri, 'I see you.''Avatar' apparently cost $300 million dollars to make. I understand since inception about 10 years ago along with development of motion capture technology the cost may approach half a billion dollars. Looks like all that effort has been worth it. We truly get the emotions of the actors in their expression. The Na'vi move so languidly and fluidly. Cameron's 'Avatar' is a visually stunning and classic hero story—the likes of which have never been seen before.",10,6,12,23 December 2009
La La Land," Dreams Give Life
","Emma Stone angelically sings, 'Here's to the ones who dream...' in a showcase moment in 'La La Land'. Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are enchanting. Director and Writer Damien Chazelle's musical is an ode to the dreamers and to passionately pursuing your dreams. I love 'La La Land'. 'La La Land' is an amazing love story-- bitter sweet and resoundingly poignant. It made me happy. 'La La Land' touched my heart. I did not expect this from an old school movie musical. Director Chazelle lyrically outs this with the opening number as performers sing and dance atop their cars stranded in traffic on a Los Angeles freeway. In cosmic synchronicity lovers, Sebastian (Gosling) and Mia (Stone), meet when one flips the other 'the bird'. Yes, only in La La Land— Los Angeles. In the days of Astaire and Rogers, musicals used to cast gifted singers and dancers, who could act. 'La La Land' has gifted actors Stone and Gosling, who can sing and dance. This resonates for 'La La Land', because it is eloquently about the choices we make in life and the possibilities. As Stone smiles on a bench at the Griffith Park observatory, she is sublime—both joyous and sad. Gosling speaks with such soulful conviction to Stone about jazz being 'always new'. Even by narrative design as they burst into song or dance, Stone and Gosling ground with touching authenticity the compromises they sacrifice for their dreams. I read that Stone and Gosling both trained rigorously for months for their roles. Gosling also displays mastery at the piano. Their performances are among the year's best. So is 'La La Land'. Stone is Mia, an aspiring actress and full-time barista at a coffee shop on a Hollywood Studio lot. Gosling is Sebastian, a jazz pianist working at restaurant and jazz bar, who dreams of one day opening his own club. They meet a couple times before they get the universe's message. They share their dreams. Mia is frustrated with audition failures, and is at heart a writer and wonderful storyteller. Sebastian yearns to make jazz vital and alive for people. Sebastian is estranged from successful band-mate Keith (very cool John Legend). Love arises for Mia and Sebastian in the movie theater in Rialto. Director Chazelle literally transforms gently holding hands into a dazzling dance amidst the stars. The dancing and music in 'La La Land' are astonishing. The dancing is particularly moving with Stone and Gosling. They have that magical chemistry. The songs by composer Justin Hurwitz and lyricists Benj Pasek and Justin Paul are catchy with a few that are memorable. Although, Hurwitz's final musical composition is wondrous. Life happens for Mia and Sebastian filled with joy and heartbreak, and through it all is love. Mia says, 'I'm always gonna love you.' Emma Stone allows us to see her soul through her eyes. Her performance is amazing. Stone is beautiful and is luminescent on screen. Gosling is so classically handsome, and he disarms with his fearless vulnerability. Stone and Gosling are such soulful actors and are the heart of 'La La Land'. Dreams give life. With them, we surrender to love and what happens will be so. 'La La Land' made me happy. 'La La Land' touches and inspires.",10,3,8,2 January 2017
The Last Samurai," Honor in Life and Death
","In a pivotal scene in 'The Last Samurai' a key character says 'It's my time...'. That captures Bushido (The Way of the Samurai) in Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise's 'The Last Samurai': About honor and choosing the path of one's life. Rarely has a major motion picture done so, in such a moving and inspiring way. Edward Zwick directs a wonderful screenplay by John Logan, Zwick, and Marshall Herskovitz. Zwick masterfully weaves a story about a culture, Bushido that values honor, courage, compassion, and a man's life being complete and at peace. Regarding destiny, Tom Cruise's Captain Nate Algren says '...No... But I think a man cannot know his destiny. He can only do what he can, until his destiny is revealed.' Zwick balances Bushido as 'Life in every breath...' with LIVING with honor. Tom Cruise gives perhaps his best performance as Nate Algren, the U.S. Captain who becomes samurai.It is 1876, and Capt. Algren (Cruise) is a drunk, burnt out calvary war hero who is a spokesman for Winchester rifles at amusement shows. He is recruited by his former commander Col. Bagley (a very slick Tony Goldwyn) and a Japanese businessman Omura (played with great duplicity by Masato Harada) to train the Japan Emperor's Army in modern warfare to defeat the Emperor's former adviser and Sensei, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), who is samurai. Though Bagley betrayed Algren in the past, he accepts the post. According Algren (Cruise) killing 'tribal' leaders is his only gift. Algren though broken, demonstrates the samurai spirit. Contrary to Algren's advice an unprepared Imperial Army engages Katsumoto's army, and are defeated. Algren fights valiantly, but is captured.This is where the amazing story telling begins. Katsumoto wishes to learn about his enemy, Algren. In a strange twist of fate, he has his sister, Taka (Koyuki), care for Algren-- her 'karma'. There is more to this (see the movie). In Katsmoto's village Algren trains in the way of the samurai. Zwick illustrates this eloquently. He does not romanticize the samurai, rather paints a complete picture. The samurai would kill his enemy or take his own life in dishonor when commanded. Along with the rigorous martial arts training, Zwick shows the samurai meditating (Shinto and Zen), composing poetry (haiku), in tea ceremony, and practicing calligraphy. Bushido is a dichotomy. I also got an insight into my own Japanese culture that everything is below the surface. During a bokken (wooden sword) training scene with Algren and Katsmoto's second Ujio ( masterful martial artist, Hiroyuki Sanada), he learns one of the keys of mastery-- mu-shin ('no mind'). Cruise performs the martial arts sequences expertly. He intensely trained in Aikido and Iaido-- signatured in his posture and gate wearing the hakama and kimono. All the fight scenes are exquisite. World class martial artists are involved in 'Samurai'.Ken Watanabe is a noble and commanding presence as Katsumoto. He is truly Samurai. He is a great actor-- he is just being. His transformation from Algren's enemy to partner is key to the story. Whether Cruise's Algren fights beside Watanabe's Katsumoto in an assassination attempt or in their personal conversations, their bond embodies the respect of two strong, smart men, who have seen too much war and death. Their relationship is poignant and inspiring. After the winter Algren returns to Kyoto and to the Emperor's Army, but his heart and soul are samurai. Soon he must choose his loyalty as a matter of honor. In a great scene Taka explains to Algren that her son, Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu), is a child who does not understand Bushido, and is afraid of losing Algren. Speaking in Japanese Algren tells Higen that his always afraid in war. It is the paradox of the honor conversation: living honorably is as important as dying honorably.The Japanese cast is incredible. Koyuki as Taka is amazing and stunningly beautiful. She is the traditional Japanese woman who downplays her strength and wisdom. Yet, she is the emotional anchor of 'Samurai'. Shin Koyamada as Nobutada (Katsumoto's son) is brash with a great warrior spirit. Sosuke Ikematsu is touching as Taka's young son growing up samurai.This is Tom Cruise's best performance. Aside from mastering the peripheral elements like martial arts and speaking Japanese, his performance as Nate Algren is captivating. It is not formula. The transformation from burn out war hero to the honorable leader of men is moving. You see it in the actor's eyes, and hear it in his voice as Algren begins to care about and honor people, and himself. Algren's path to be a peace with himself is the most human and noble of all endeavors. Cruise does it right.Katsumoto says at one point in the movie that the Samurai are no longer necessary. Algren says what could be more necessary than honor, courage, and compassion? Zwick and Cruise remind us of this, from a culture long gone, in a very special movie. We honor them for doing so.",10,1,2,11 January 2004
Up," Up is Amazing-- Cross my heart
","After the first 15 minutes of Peter Docter and Bob Peterson's 'Up', I was in tears. I kept thinking this does not bode well for me. In those 15 minutes without much dialogue, the miraculous storytelling of Docter, Peterson, and Thomas McCarthy realizes such heart felt poignancy. We see the life of widower Carl Fredricksen and his wife Ellie up until the present. Carl (brilliantly voiced by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man, who believes the best part of his life has passed him. In 'Up' Carl was supposed to go on Ellie's dream trip to Paradise Falls in South America, but this does not happen. Instead of surrendering to a retirement home, Carl decides to go on the trip to Paradise Falls by hooking up a fleet of balloons to his house. In the process Carl inadvertently high jacks spirited Wilderness Explorer Scout Russell (wonderful Jordan Nagai). Thus, the adventure begins.'Up' is the best movie of the year. The animation is visually astounding. Whether we watch Carl's house navigate through the clouds and horrendous storms, or Russell befriending the giant brightly colored mythological bird in the deepest jungles of South America, whom he names 'Kevin'. As it turns out Kevin is actually a she. The Paradise Falls themselves are amazingly beautiful. I can even be with the more out there narrative elements like dogs talking through electronic collar translators, because it is absurd context. I loved dog Dug (playfully voiced by Bob Peterson), who initially finds Carl and Russell. Turns out, the dogs' owner is famed explorer Charles Muntz (sublimely evil Christopher Plummer), who is also searching for 'Kevin' in an attempt to reinvent his ridiculed legacy.At the heart of 'Up' is Carl and Russell. Directors Docter and Peterson create a magical chemistry. At first Russell occurs as an annoying Explorer scout in search of his last merit badge—by helping elderly Carl. Carl is this cantankerous old man, who seems to be waiting out the rest of his life. Throughout he keeps calling to 'Ellie' in lieu of speaking to real people—other than Russell. In a hysterical exchange Carl suggests playing a game: Who can go the longest without saying anything? Excited Russell says, 'Cool! My Mom loves that game!' However, there is more to Russell than blinding eagerness. While struggling to pitch his tent, Carl inquires why Russell's Dad didn't teach him. Russell replies that his Dad was a great camper, but he didn't get to teach him. Later in the beautiful moment of 'Up', Carl looks through Ellie's photo album. Sitting in his chair he mouths, 'Cross my heart' Again, I was in tears. 'Up' is all eloquence and heart. Docter and Peterson brilliantly balance the hysterical and the touching.'Up' is all about the wonder and beauty of life. You wonder how Docter and Peterson can circle back and conclude the story. They do, and the fade away scene is as poignant and sweet as anything you will experience. 'Up' is beautiful and amazing.",10,1,3,7 June 2009
National Treasure," Popcorn, Medium Drink, and a Couple Hours
","Jon Turtletaub's 'National Treasure' is such a rarity in movies, in that you don't have to think about it, enjoy the ride, and make sure you have enough popcorn and soda. Though get the medium drink. After all the movie is 2 hours and change. The 'think' comment is not an intended slam, but rather a recommendation. The screenplay by the team of Jim Kouf, Cormac Wibberley, and Marianne Wibberley has a very novel concept which is entirely envisioned as an action adventure. Turtletaub, as Director, executes the action and adventure with great skill, pacing, and a sheer sense of fun. The movie also looks great.Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates, who as a kid was enrolled by his Grandfather's (Christopher Plummer) stories of a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. According to the legend, the treasure map leads to a vast fortune hidden by the Founding Fathers after the Revolutionary War. As the movie opens we find grown up Ben, now a treasure hunter/ historian of some sort, along with his sidekick Riley (Justin Bartha), and slippery business partner, Ian Howe, at the North Pole in pursuit of the legendary treasure. Predictably Ben and Ian become adversaries in search of the fortune. The FBI are thrown somewhere into the mix.Ben becomes convinced that the only way to protect the treasure from falling into the wrong hands (that being Ian's), both he and Riley must steal the Declaration of Independence first. Enter Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), curator of the National Archives. She thinks that Ben and Riley are conspiracy crazed crack-heads. Well, not really, but she thinks they are nuts. However, due to a slew of events Abigail finds herself aligned with the boys. Along the way, we find out enough about the history surrounding the Declaration of Independence to stake out the category on 'Jeopardy'. The rest of 'National Treasure' is a wild ride, and to it's credit, most of it is clever.The cast is excellent. Nicolas Cage wonderfully plays the geek hero. He is perfect as the normal guy caught in a ridiculous situation. His Ben is not the coolest, but he is strong, smart, intense, and has a sense of humor. Justin Bartha offers expert comic relief as Riley. Diane Kruger is gorgeous, sharp, and funny as Abigail. She fairs much better here, than she did in 'Troy'. Sean Bean infuses an understated menace and danger as Ian. Credit the cast and Turtletaub for never taking themselves or the movie too seriously, and for providing a very good time at the movies.",8,1,2,19 December 2004
Beauty and the Beast," Still the tale as old as time...
","Emma Watson is a star. 'Beauty and the Beast' may be flawed in its excess, and is more touching and human than the animated original. Emma Watson is radiant, beautiful, and inspired. This live action reinvention of 'Beauty and the Beast' remains the 'tale as old as time'. Watson's Belle is rescued from killer wolves by the brave Beast played by the tormented and noble Dan Stevens, but he is wounded and bleeding from the attack. He fights with great strength and rage. The Beast unexpectedly sacrifices for Belle, and lies on the ground of the wintry forest. Belle turns about to leave and escape her imprisonment. Gentleness melts her visage as she turns back to rescue him in return. 'Beauty and the Beast' enrolled me then.The wondrous souls of Watson and Stevens reinvent 'Beauty and the Beast'. Through astounding make-up and CGI effects, Steven's Beast is the towering horned majestic lion. His Beast embodies both joy and suffering in his gentle blue eyes. Stevens accomplishes the nearly impossible. He is a handsome man, and his Beast becomes beautiful as he allows us to see his soul and forsaken dreams. Watson is natural beauty with freckles on her nose. Her Belle's innocence discovers the truth in others, be it the Beast or the ghastly Gaston. Watson and Stevens are beautifully sublime. With the largely familiar story-line and great songs by Alan Menken and Hal Ashman of the original 1991 animated movie, Director Bill Condon's recreation is about loss, destiny, and falling in love. His spectacular vision creates the haunting images of the wintry forest and the Beast's austere castle. This is a musical, and Condon wonderfully orchestrates the song and dance. He does homage to 'The Sound of Music' with Belle singing on the hills of her village. Watson and Stevens make us believe in Belle and Beast's love story. There may be one too many dance numbers or introspective character musical solos. Fortunately, they are not too distracting. Screenwriters Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliotopoulos invent the poignant back stories of Belle's and the Beast's deceased Mothers humanizing this fairy tale. This is timeless tale of true love and forgiveness. The story opens as the narcissist Prince, played by believable Stevens, callously dismisses the gifted rose from an old woman visiting his castle. This was his test. The old woman reveals herself as the Enchantress, played by stunning Hattie Morahan. She casts a spell upon the Prince transforming him into the Beast and his servants into living furniture. He shall remain the Beast until he can fall in love with someone, who loves him back. The Prince must do so before all the petals on the rose fall; otherwise, the curse is forever. Belle's opening song expresses her uniqueness. She is the independent spirit, who loves books, and has great dreams. They do not include braggart Gaston played by talented Luke Evans, who wants to marry Belle. She tells him, 'I will never marry you.' Belle cares for her watchmaker Father Maurice played by kind Kevin Kline. Belle's Mother died years ago and she was Maurice's love story. He tells Belle of her Mom, 'Your Mother was fearless.' Belle is like her. One night Maurice becomes lost and trespasses the Beast's castle. Beast imprisons him until Belle bravely takes her Father's place. Beast's servants wonder if Belle is the one, who will break the wicked spell? As enemies Belle and the Beast aren't so different. They both love Shakespeare. The Beast reads 'Guinevere and Lancelot', which Belle labels, 'Still a romance.' He too, is a dreamer who loves books. He shares his vast library with Belle.Belle discovers the servants' loyalty to the Beast. The young prince was very much like his loving Mother. After she died, his Father's cruelty hardened his extraordinary spirit. Belle begins to see his noble wounded heart. The Beast doubts she will end his curse, telling his servants, 'Look at me!' I know that resolve. He too is falling in love with Belle. Condon's ballroom dance with the Beast and Belle in golden gown is nostalgic, new, and touching. Emma Thompson as the teapot Mrs. Potts beautifully sings the theme, 'Beauty and the Beast'. Beast frees Belle when tragedy arises. She promises to come back. Candelabra Lumiere, voiced by Ewan McGregor, asks Beast about the spell and Belle. He says, 'I let her go.' Mr. Potts says, 'Because he loves her.' The miscalculation of the movie is villain Gaston. He is the arrogant stupid narcissist without nuance. We cheer for Belle and Beast against Gaston, often because nothing redeems him. Belle and Beast emerge as heroes in this conflict. Hearing Beast say to Belle 'You came back.'— is so touching. 'Beauty and the Beast' has a wonderful human quality and spirit. It reminds of the old and recreates as new. Emma Watson is amazing in this 'tale as old as time'. Take a chance on 'Beauty and the Beast'.",9,7,16,20 March 2017
The Descent," If you go in there...
","After watching 'The Descent', my bud Robert and I decided that spelunking would now come off both our 'To Do' listsfor good. Writer and Director Neil Marshall's 'The Descent' crafts and sustains an unrelenting tension throughout, once you get past the suspended disbelief. As I watched the women one by one crawl through the tiny water filled crevice to enter the caverns somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains, I thought, 'How are they going to get back? They've got to be nuts!' Well, you just have to go with it. Well, kind of. Fortunately, director Marshall effectively pretexts the story. The prior thrill-seeking jaunt for the group was a white water rafting trip. Following that trip, Sarah (Shauna MacDonald) suffers a life altering tragedy. A year later, Sarah and her close friend Beth (Alex Reid) join up with the gang at a cabin in the Appalachians. The 6 women are gearing up for a cave exploration trip headed by Juno (Natalie Mendoza). Apparently, Juno regrets not being there for Sarah following her personal tragedy and recovery. Juno sees this trip as an opportunity to empower Sarah. Those along for the ride include Becca (Saskia Mulder), Sam (MyAnna Buring), and Holly (Nora-Jane No one).The trip starts out curious enough when Juno (Mendoza) discards her map of the caves. The women proceed, and are undeterred by the telltale signs of mysterious animal carcasses. Not surprisingly, the cave exploration goes horribly wrong. They are lost without a clue how to get out, and they are being hunted by terrifying fleshing eating creatures. So the women are literally in the fight for their lives. Marshall masterfully orchestrates the mood and tension. My bud Robert keenly pointed out that what really works in 'The Descent' is that it never evolves into a trite action movie. No one screams, 'Take that you, Mother F-----!' Granted Marshall may have intended his story as an empowerment allegory. The women are authentically terrified, and fight with all their courage and heart amidst their overwhelming fear. Somehow while they are thrashing and being thrashed by the fierce creatures, it is all strangely believablestrangely. Rather it gets you thinking: 'Would I do the same?' Sarah (Macdonald) and Juno (Mendoza) in particular emerge as forces to be reckoned with. Mendoza's Juno warrior spirit is consistent and engagingshe is the brash leader. MacDonald is powerful and believable in Sarah's emergence as a heroic presence. All the performances are strong throughout.Marshall maintains a claustrophobic feel and keeps us on edge. The unveiled details involving the cave creatures regarding their possible evolution is a nice touch. 'The Descent' has to be one of the most gory horror movies with realistic violenceand I am not a big horror fan. However, I am a big hero fan. 'The Descent' has great women heroes. Shauna Macdonald and Natalie Mendoza are awesome. 'The Descent' is a wild tension filled ride. At the very end one wonders, 'What next?'",8,139,196,18 August 2006
Inside Man," Inside Spike
","Spike Lee directing a bank robbery movie? 'Inside Man' is not an obvious Spike Lee movieat least until you realize what he accomplishes in this medium. His 'Inside Man' has a high power and impeccable cast lead by Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, and Jodie Foster. Russell Gerwirtz's edgy smart retrospective screenplay engages throughout eventually unfolding as a morality play. The movie opens with the charismatic Clive Owen as bank robber Dalton Russell who professes to have pulled off the 'perfect crime'. We soon realize that the story is a retelling of past events, though any resolution of events is made purposefully unclearat least in the beginning.Dalton and crew take hostages in a prominent national bank owned by the elderly Arthur Case (mysteriously played by Christopher Plummer). The robbers force the hostages to wear the same jump suits as the robbers; thus, making them virtually indistinguishable. Upon hearing the news of the hostages and robbery attempt Case (Plummer) instead of immediately calling the Police, calls Madeline White (a strikingly bold and arrogant Jodie Foster) who is some sort of ace power broker. What Madeline actually does for a living is left intentionally vague. However, she does point out to Det. Frazier (Denzel Washington) that 'I don't think you can afford me.' Case is concerned about his personal contents in a safety deposit box in his bank, for which he enrolls Madeline's services to protect. In a fascinating character turn Denzel Washington plays Det. Keith Frazier, a detective first grade wannabe assigned to the hostage situation only because his superior is on vacation. The commanding Washington cleverly navigates as this burn out detective grasping for his last chance at reclaiming greatness. Washington expertly balances Frazier's gifted smarts along with his perceived ordinariness. He is an unexpected formidable foil to Foster's cold razor-like Madeline and Clive Owen's dangerous and edgy Dalton.Writer Gerwirtz and Director Lee stylishly unveil their story where all is not what it seems. Washington as Frazier soon realizes that he may be a pawn in the grand power play by Madeline (Foster) and Case (Plummer). The audience also begins to distinguish that Owen's Dalton is not motivated by greed, but instead something more like honor. 'Inside Man' is glossed with witty and sharp exchanges. Washington and Owen are powerful. Jodie Foster playing the cool calculated Madeline White all but steals the movie. This is particularly noteworthy given that her role is the most amorphous. Her Madeline exists out of her sheer force of will. 'Inside Man' resolves as a surpriseat least for me. We encounter some narrative logical challenges in particular the age of the Case character, and the reason for retaining one of the deposit box incriminating contents. And for the most part we can forgive these logical indiscretions. For the most part. In keeping with Spike Lee vision 'Inside Man' is really about justice and karma. See 'Inside Man'. It has compelling story telling and superb acting.",9,1,2,15 April 2006
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," The One There By Your Side
","'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is less smart ass than the original and all heart. 'Guardians 2' is all about family. 'Vol. 2' is the movie rarity—the sequel greater than the original. 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' retains its whimsical irreverence and funnier than thou swag with stunning visuals. From the opening sequence the Guardians hilariously thrash and get thrashed by a galactic serpent on some distant planet. Their mission is to recover some invaluable unpronounceable energy batteries for the elitist Sovereign race. Director and Writer James Gunn establishes the veiled narrative thread, and the movie is warp speed ahead.Incredible action and wisecracks aside what creates 'Guardians 2' as special is family. I was moved and inspired as Chris Pratt's Peter confesses, 'Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life is right there beside you all along.' From the first 'Guardians' we recall the deadly rivalry of the sisters Gamora, played by strong nurturing Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by suffering and poignant Karen Gillan. After fighting nearly to the death, Nebula cries to her sister, 'You're the one who wanted to win! I wanted a sister!' Saldana and Gillan are amazing. 'Guardians 2' fiercely dares to touch your heart.Chris Pratt impressively chiseled his body to play Peter Quill. He admirably helms the action star mantle. He makes 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' greater as a whole. He does charming smart ass whether he is clumsily romancing beautiful Saldana's Gamora or delivering throwaway on-liners. Pratt's humanity distinguishes him as a true star. Peter discovers his father Ego, played by charismatic Kurt Russell. Ego is the Celestial-- literally a god, who left Peter's dying Mother. Peter asks his Father if she was the love of his life, why he left her. Peter says, 'I had to watch her die!' Michael Rooker's Ravager thief Yondu was the one who raised Peter in Ego's absence. All is not what it seems. Rooker's nobility and compassion resonates the profound conflict of Peter's Fathers. Ego tells Peter that he loves him, having finally found him after all these years. He wants to share his legacy and power with his son. James Gunn brilliantly orchestrates the interstellar action, wisecracks, and tragedy. He fearlessly evokes his version of Shakespeare in this comic book tale. 'Guardians 2' is wildly entertaining with the great soul. Hysterical mercenary Rocket, the cybernetic raccoon voiced by sarcastic Bradley Cooper, steals some of the Sovereign batteries as lovely parting gifts from the arrogant golden skinned jerks. Humorless Queen Ayesha, played by wonderfully zealous Elizabeth Debicki, sends her 'gamer' operated space fleet upon the Guardians in retaliation. Fortunately, Ego and his companion Mantis, played by whimsical beauty Pom Klementieff, save our heroes from destruction. Ego tells Peter that he is his father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax, played by brutishly funny Dave Bautista, agree to accompany his Father to his home planet Ego—the planet he created. The visual images of Ego are idyllic and serene. Russell's Ego is both omnipotent and the great enigma. Mantis is the gifted empath, who helps him sleep and protects his secrets. Ego welcomes his son home, revealing his destiny. Ego doesn't necessarily add up. Is this what Peter wished for?Director Gunn's 'Guardians 2' invents the narrative spectrum of David Hasselhoff jokes, cool retro '70s rock, kick ass martial arts, galactic ship battles, and quirky charming relationships. With Gunn's direction all his stars give their best. Bautista's hulking tatted blue warrior Drax is crude, brave, and soulful. Klementieff's Mantis is mesmerizing charm. She is genuinely kind, crushing on Big Drax. Saldana is awesome. She has a commanding and calming screen presence. Gunn could have leveraged more romance in Gamora and Peter's love story. Throughout Pratt and Saldana generate authentic chemistry. The narrative focus is on Peter's bond with his fathers, and Gamora's reconcile with estranged sister Nebula. Saldana is radiant and noble with Gillan's surprising Nebula. Gillan's humanity emerges as we empathize for her desire to be loved. I think 'Guardians 2' becomes the story of the Fathers and their son —of love and destiny. All is not what it appears. Russell and Rooker are eloquently polarizing forces. Pratt embodies courage and fearless vulnerability as Peter boldly defines the man he wants to be. 'Guardians 2' is touchingly, tearfully about unconditional love and choice. Considering the grand design of the movie that is the wondrous surprise. Simple and sweet. I loved 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2'.",10,60,110,8 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," True Magic
","'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' is a wonderful movie. This comes from a Harry Potter illiterate. The story and movie are very reminiscent of the Star Wars mythology. Orphan Harry has special gifts-- an undeveloped and natural power. He like Luke Skywalker is the chosen One. So he must be trained. In Harry's case this takes place at the Hogwart School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is to become a great wizard, like Luke becomes a powerful Jedi. Along the way, we learn that there is a very powerful and seductive 'dark side' to Magic. Ultimately the path is a choice or perhaps a sacrifice. Harry feels alone and incomplete-- he yearns for his dead parents. The whole scene with Harry sitting in front of the Mirror of Erised and speaking with Richard Harris as Dumbledore (Hogswart Headmaster) made it for me. Dumbledore says that men have gone mad looking into the Mirror living their dreams, '...forgetting to live.' Great stuff. Looks like the other books may be darker as Harry seeks out the man responsible for murdering his parents. Also the message that true magic does not come from books, rather from friendship, bravery, and ultimately love is touching. The movie is a magical journey of a hero, Harry. The movie is stunning visually. The John William's music and sound set the right atmosphere. I gather that director Chris Columbus steered by the R.K. Rowling's book (from the Steven Kloves screenplay). To his credit he generates strong performances from his actors. Daniel Radcliffe (who looks like John Lennon as a boy) is perfect as Harry-- the lonely and courageous boy coming into his own, and finding and creating a family. Emma Watson as know-it-all, Hermione, all but steals the movie. Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley is charming and funny. Robbie Coltrane is great as the protector Hagrid. Alan Rickman is at his slippery evil best as Prof. Snape. An unusually restrained Richard Harris is excellent as the Headmaster Dumbledore, the powerful, wise, and whacky mentor. Maggie Smith as Headmistress McGonagall is great as the strict and compassionate professor. As one of my friends says-- 'Maggie Smith rocks!' 'Harry Potter' is total entertainment. I will read the book.",9,0,0,21 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Hero Emerges
","In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' Harry (now older Daniel Radcliffe) arises as a hero. Though not a literary reference, Harry Potter's emergence is reminiscent of another dark hero in 'Batman Begins'. In that movie, Bruce Wayne's mentor Ducard tells his charge, 'The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act.' Granted aside from both movies being Warner Brothers productions, the analogy is not that far fetched. Director Mike Newell's fourth installment of the Harry Potter saga is the series' darkest and perhaps best. Harry (wonderfully played by Radcliffe) acknowledges and reclaims his greatness albeit reluctantly. He battles great evil and his own fear and insecurities through sheer willthe will to act. The evolving Radcliffe embodies his Harry with the right balance of vulnerability and courage as his character believes the best in others while acknowledging his own demons. Mike Newell masterfully crafts his hero's journey reflecting the great storytelling of author J.K. Rowling and screenwriter Steven Kloves. Hogwarts Headmaster Dumbledore advises young Harry, 'Soon we must face the choice between what is right and what is easy.' 'Harry Potter' under the guidance of Newell does right. It's about character.'Goblet of Fire' opens with Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) attending the Quidditch World Cup. However, things go horribly wrong. The arrival of the Death Eaters and the Dark Mark in the skies foretell of the return of Lord Voldermort (malevolent Ralph Fiennes).Representatives of two other rival schools arrive at Hogwarts to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. The names of the school champions are selected from the Goblet of Fire. The competition is restricted to 17 year-olds. The three champions selected are Viktor (Stanislev Ianevski), Fleur (Clemence Poesy), and Cedric (Robert Pattison) from Hogwarts. Surprisingly The Goblet of Fire makes a fourth selection: 14 year-old Harry. All contestants must endure three challenges where they could possibly forfeit their lives. Harry has the least training of the four. Also Harry knows he must eventually face Lord Voldermort, the man who killed his parents and failed to kill Harry himself.This dark story of redemption is a compelling hero's tale. At it's emotional center is a powerful and compassionate performance by Daniel Radcliffe as Harry. He has great support from Emma Watson and Rupert Grint. Michael Gambon is perfect as the brave and wise Dumbledore. An almost unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes is a powerful force as the evil Voldermort. In 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' Radcliffe's Harry arises from the ashes like the Phoenix reclaiming and embracing his inherent greatness, and inspiring greatness in others. It is not the training or wizard's talent, rather the power he distinguishes deep inside himself that saves Harry. Harry finds the will to act, and fights great evil while reconciling his own fear.Mike Newell's 'Goblet of Fire' establishes Harry Potter as hero. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry has emerged as a gifted and powerful young actor. May the evolving story of the wizard Harry Potter in the movies continue to transform and compel as this movie does.",10,1,1,24 November 2005
Thor," Thor Soars
","In the climactic battle of brother against brother, Loki (amazing Tom Hiddleston) confesses to Thor (commanding Chris Hemsworth), 'I never wanted to be King. I only wanted to be your equal!' That arc captures the surprising greatness and ambition of Director Kenneth Branagh's 'Thor'. Branagh, who is known more for his Shakespearean adaptations, is an unlikely candidate for 'Thor', based on the beloved Marvel superhero. However, here Branagh's Shakespearean sensibilities well serve 'Thor'. 'Thor' is mesmerizing as it retells the Norse Mythology of Odin and Asgard. 'Thor' tells the timeless story of sons vying for their father's love, and betrayal. 'Thor' at its summit is classic Greek Tragedy, like the best comic book heroes. This is so unexpected given the numerous screen and story writers involved: Ashley Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Don Payne, J. Michael Straczynski, and Mark Potosevich. The source material is the comic book by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby.'Thor' is defiantly engrossing. It is also so well acted with Academy Award Winners Anthony Hopkins as Odin and Natalie Portman as intrepid scientist Jane Foster. Both command gravitas, especially Hopkins. Rene Russo strongly plays Odin's wife devoted Frigga. Tom Hiddleston virtually steals the movie as the duplicitous Loki. He brilliantly balances villainy and tragedy. Idris Elba is powerful and noble as gold armored Gatekeeper Heimdall. Newcomer Chris Hemsworth is charismatic and surprisingly charming and funny. The dude is classically handsome with blonde mane and chiseled body. I had read how he trained for 'Thor'-- he looks amazing. He is a great action guy as he dispatches S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents like nothing. More impressive than his ripped abs, is his screen presence, and he holds his own with Hopkins. He and Hopkins have a visceral chemistry. In a touching scene Thor admits to his Father Odin, 'Someday perhaps, I shall make you proud' In that moment I was reminded of Hopkins and Brad Pitt in 'Meet Joe Black'.In 'Thor', Thor (Hemsworth) is a reckless, vain, and arrogant warrior and god. He is Odin's favorite son, and that wounds the very soul of his brother Loki (Hiddleston). Thor is next in line to King Odin. We learn from Norse mythology that Asgard maintains a truce with their mortal enemies the Frost Giants, lead by malevolent King Laufey (darkly seething Colm Feore), following a legendary battle with Odin. Outraged by terrorist interruption of his ascension Thor leads his loyal group of warriors along with Loki to engage the Frost Giants. His rashness threatens all out war in the Realms. Odin says, 'You are a vain greedy, cruel boy.' Thor strikes back, 'You are an old man, and a fool!' Odin banishes his son Thor to Earth. His mighty hammer Mjollnir also plummets to the deserts of New Mexico—as we recall from 'Iron Man 2'. Only the one deserving to wield the power of Thor can raise the hammer. Scattered genius Dr. Jane Foster (Portman) literally crashes into earth bound Thor. Jane and her team, Erik (Stellen Skarsgard) and Darcy (funny Kat Dennings), have been tracking repeated cosmic disturbances in the desert.Geeky and klutzy Jane resists her attraction to the hunky Thor. Shocking. At the same time, the Government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. and Agent Coulson (deft straight man Clark Gregg) isolate Thor's hammer in a covert operation of grave national security. They also confiscate all of Jane's research. There is some funny fish out of water humor at Thor's expense. As much as Erik does not want to admit, all things point to the Norse God of Thunder. Thor gives his Viking word of honor to Jane, knowing that he endangers them both.Back in Asgard, the conflicted Loki is both beholding to and jealous of his brother. He so fiercely desires the love and approval of his father. Loki confirms the tragic betrayal from Odin, who then falls gravely ill. Hiddleston is powerful as Loki perpetuates a lie. He dearly loves his brother, but he cannot forgive his perceived betrayal. In this 'Thor' soars. The weakness in 'Thor' resides in the Earth bound story. Granted 'Thor' is a predictable transformation and surrender of courage and humility. However, the love story of Thor and Jane is the least evolved. I think in the classic story of the Hero, Director Branagh intended this to be a source of power, but perhaps this got lost in the editing. What remains is still great and compelling. 'Thor' is heroic tragedy with its tale of a Father's love, and brother's betrayal. Hopkins, Hemsworth, and Hiddleston are awesome in Branagh's Shakespearean rendering of 'Thor'.",10,2,5,8 May 2011
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Love
","'The Shape of Water' is beautiful. Writer and Director Guillermo del Toro tells the story of the shape of love, that it can look any way you can imagine. His screenplay along with co-writer Vanessa Taylor tells the poignant tale of feeling alone in the world, and the possibility of love that we all deserve. Sally Hawkins is amazing as lonely mute Elisa discovers her greatness within, her voice. Hawkins is so moving in her visage and silence. 'The Shape of Water' is the strange love story of Elisa and the noble amphibious-man Creature. Discovering that the Creature's life is threatened, Elisa implores her dear friend Giles, played by compassionate Richard Jenkins, to help save him. Through sign language Elisa says, 'When he looks at me, he does not know how I am incomplete. He sees me as I am.' That breaks your heart. Elisa just wants to be loved. She just wishes to be gotten. We all do. 'The Shape of Water' eloquently expresses humanity. Awesome Doug Jones literally inhabits the Creature through CGI effects and all. His languid movement and gentle expressions illuminate the noble Creature's generous heart of the one, who loves Elisa back. Dan Lausten's cinematography mesmerizes. Elisa is the janitor along with her friend Zelda, played by strong Octavia Spencer, on the midnight shift at the secret Government facility in Washington D.C. set in the 1960's during the height of the Cold War. The story set mostly at night has brilliant tones of gray and muted lighting in the midst of this touching love story fable. Del Toro gracefully balances the dichotomy of the narratives. Lausten and del Toro create the astounding images of Jones's shimmering regal blue Creature, nearly human enough for us to cheer on. Amazingly del Toro's world of 'The Shape of Water' is mostly light or dark, little gray. The light is Elisa and Giles. Narrator Giles opens the tale of 'the princess without voice'. Jenkins's Giles is the old unemployed commercial artist, who suffers over his sexual identity. Brilliant Michael Shannon as Government Agent Strickland is the dark. Strickland captured the legendary Creature from the Amazon bringing him back to DC to uncover his secrets. He mercilessly tortures the Creature. In the meantime the Russians are also interested in the mysterious 'asset' and pursue him as well. Strickland represents the one downside of del Toro's narrative. As embodied by Shannon, Strickland is clever, cruel, vicious and insufferably pious. He is also bigoted. He has no nuance. Greater villains are much grayer. Though gray comes in the form of wise Michael Stuhlberg as Dr. Hoffstetler, the dedicated scientist who seems stand for the Creature. We first see Hawkins's Elisa awake to begin her janitor night shift. She sets the timer to boil her eggs while she routinely pleasures herself in the bath. Elisa bares telltale scars on her neck. She packs two bagged lunches, one for her apartment neighbor friend Giles (Jenkins). She smiles and takes her bus to work. Hawkins is understated power in how she expresses Elisa's profound loneliness and hopefulness without saying. Much of the beauty of 'The Shape of Water' is in the unsaid. Being with the Creature though unlikely as it seems, we get that it is Elisa's 'perchance to dream'. Hawkins harnesses Elisa's authentic desperation, and her great heart touches us with the lighter side of our humanity. 'The Shape of Water' is the fantastical love story fable. The great fables allow us to enter that world of wonder. 'The Shape of Water' is the possibility of love no matter what it looks like. That is the world worth visiting, and perhaps living in as well.",10,48,94,25 December 2017
The Matrix Reloaded," Because they can...
","The much awaited 'The Matrix Reloaded' by Andy and Larry Wachowski is entertaining, great looking, bewildering, and ultimately an exercise in making a big budget movie, 'because I can' rather than making a complete movie-- which The Matrix was. I liked the movie, although there is something missing in this one. 'Reloaded' clarifies The Matrix, and then goes down the path of layered cyber-reality coupled with both Bibical and Buddhist references. What is the Oracle? And who is the Architect of the Matrix? Is Neo really the One? The acting is uneven. And is this surprising given the quality of the first movie. Lawrence Fishburne really chews up the scenery in a couple scenes as Morpheus. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss fare much better by underplaying their roles. My friend, Carrie-Anne, is very good-- I thought. Then again I am biased in this. As Trinity, Carrie-Anne is strong, sexy, and vulnerable. Keanu returning as Neo is efficient, and perhaps a little too stoic for the evolving role of the chosen One. The visuals in Reloaded are absolutely stunning-- the highway sequence is totally amazing. The fighting sequences are excellent. The one thing that was missing for me, was an emotional investment and payoff. Reloaded is high on cool, and very Zen-ed out. At times it is like (really when you think about it) The Wizard of Oz jacked on steroids and coke. However, Reloaded lacks some of the charm and humanity of The Matrix. This may be one of the dangers or pitfalls of catching a Messiah tale in Act 2. 'Reloaded' is also a bit significant about itself. What made The Matrix great, is that it was a cool action movie with a rather novel concept. People just read significance into it. At times 'Reloaded' is a convoluted philosophical sledgehammer. Anyway, I may be too far down the rabbit hole on this one...",8,0,0,31 May 2003
The Fountain," Living with Grace
","The opening sequences of 'The Fountain' are disorienting, even having a clue about the movie. In one scene Hugh Jackman is conquistador Tomas battling fierce warriors before a Mayan temple in the service of his Queen Isabel (Rachel Weisz). In the next, Jackman is Tom Creo traveling in a spherical globe to a distant nebula in 2500 A.D. with what looks like the remains of a tree. My clarity comes from having seen the entire movie. Director and Screenwriter Darren Aronofsky is bold and daring in 'The Fountain'. Though flawed, Arononfsky's 'The Fountain' needs to be acknowledged for its ambition and nobility. 'The Fountain' is worthy of view and thought as perhaps one of the year's best. Granted the movie is not for everyone. On the surface 'The Fountain' is about the search for eternal life. As poignantly pleaded by Tommy (Jackman) in the present day, he wishes to 'stop dying (death)'. 'The Fountain' is a reference to the Fountain of Youth. From Genesis, when Adam and Eve were banished from the Garden of Eden after tasting from the Tree of Knowledge, the Tree of Life was forfeited and lost forever. Or perhaps it was not.I believe that Aronofsky is really interested in coming to terms with one's mortality and making peace with that. In the present story setting Izzy Creo (Weisz) says to Tommy (Jackman) that 'In death there is creation.' Hers is the romantic conceit. With powerful performances from Jackman and Weisz, 'The Fountain' is about eternal love, without attachment and acceptance of fate. What resonates for me is that in the end 'The Fountain' ultimately is about one's life being whole and complete. In Aronfsky's and Ari Handel's story 'The Fountain' is a story within the movie, set in New Spain of 1500 A.D. written by Izzy. The dying Izzy tells her husband Tommy, 'Finish it.' He replies, 'I don't know how it ends.' Izzy has made her peace, but Tommy can't let go. Aronofsky touchingly asks: How does life end? 'The Fountain' has one of the most bizarre narratives of any movie, at times even vexing. The story spans 1000 years with three interconnected story lines. One is a fable of Tomas's search for the mythical Tree of Life in the New World. In the present day, Tommy (Jackman) is a brilliant and impetuous medical researcher consumed with finding a cure for his dying wife Izzy (Weisz), who suffers from a malignant brain tumor. The cure may lie in a botanical sample from Central America. In the distant future Tom (also Jackman) is on solo trek to the nebula from a Mayan legend on a mission to return the Tree of Life. Aronofsky darts back and forth between all stories at will, culminating in the compelling catharsis. Here I thought he went a little nonlinear and tangential. However, the final resolution is moving and poignant.Hugh Jackman is absolutely amazing. Though 'The Fountain' mandates concentration and effort upon viewing, Jackman's performance is effortless. I don't think anyone else could have pulled off this role. The strikingly handsome and physical Jackman has the charisma to realize the brave conquistador Captain Tomas. As researcher Tommy he is the compassionate and driven husband caring for his ailing wife Izzy. In the future as Tom, a head shaved Jackman embodies a lonely and haunted man full of regret as he looks back upon his life. Jackman is that rare combination of powerful presence and gentle compassion. Rachel Weisz is inspiring as Tommy's eternal love over several lifetimes. Weisz commands a quiet strength and a natural ease. She gives Izzy a tangible nobility. She and Jackman have beautiful chemistry. Their touching love story endures the provocative narrative shifts throughout.'The Fountain' promises a story about eternal life, and instead delivers a moving and touching story about our mortality. Perhaps, 'The Fountain' is about living with grace. Darren Aronofsky does not cleanly resolve everything. I guess much like life, we have to kind of work it out for ourselves. Acknowledge Aronofsky and story writer Handel for making a movie dominated by grand ideas. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz give inspiring and resonating performances in this eternal love story. 'The Fountain' is not the easiest movie to watch, nor is it the most black and white. However, it will make you look upon life. And that is a noble thing.",10,6,12,23 November 2006
Mystic River," Innocence Lost
","When asked what an actor should do to develop his craft, on 'In the Actor's Studio' guest Actor/ Director Clint Eastwood said that one should master 'the art of listening.' Watching Eastwood's 'Mystic River' we get a sense that we are ease-dropping on a private conversation. 'Mystic River' is the work of the director who has a mastery of his craft. Eastwood is also directing actors who are at the top of their game: Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Laurence Fishburne, and Marcia Gay Harden. This is an extraordinary accomplishment given the nature of the story-- it is difficult to sit through. Brian Helgeland ('L.A. Confidential') wrote the compelling screenplay from the novel by Dennis Lehane. 'Mystic River' tells the story of three childhood friends, Jimmy Markham (Penn), Dave Boyle (Robbins), and Sean Devine (Bacon) growing up in Boston. As the story begins Dave is abducted by two men posing as police officers, and is molested. Jumping to the present day, Jimmy's daughter Katie (Emmy Rossum) is found murdered, and the homicide detective investigating the case is Sean (Bacon). At the same time the very scarred and repressed Dave (Robbins) has a suspicious incident with a mugger that he confesses to his wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden). Hence, boyhood friends are reunited as grown men who are somewhat broken. Jimmy, a drugstore owner, has apparent mob ties. Dave, who is now married with a son, is shell of a man. Sean has been estranged from his wife and son-- he does not know where they are. So Sean along with his partner Whitey Powers (Fishburne) must find Katie Markham's murderer in a case that seems inherently linked to the past. This is by definition a difficult story to tell, and Eastwood keeps us enthralled and moves us. The intensity of the movie comes from its simplicity and eloquence. Its power derives from Eastwood's use of silence, and his confidence in his actors' mastery of listening. Sean Penn as Jimmy is absolutely powerful. There is a scene in the movie where he cries about his daughter with Robbins's Dave that is electrifying. Jimmy is clearly the marquee role. Penn should deservedly receive an Oscar nomination, and even perhaps win. Though Kevin Bacon's performance as Sean, the less showy of the lead characters, is simply stunning. It is great to be reminded what a powerful actor Kevin Bacon is. You never catch him acting-- he is just being. As Sean he is doing his best, solving a murder case while completing his past and his present. Bacon possesses a quiet power, and restrained vulnerability. In a scene near the end, Sean just listens and does not say a word, and it is haunting. We are watching an actor who is truly generating and creating art. Tim Robbins as Dave gives a heart-felt performance as broken man clumsily regaining his nobility. 'Mystic River' is a rough journey, and it ends surprisingly quietly. I guess much like Wordsworth said in 'The Prelude' that we can never return to innocence, it's just life. And it goes on. 'Mystic River' is one the year's best. Clint Eastwood, and writer Brian Helgeland along with Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, and Tim Robbins show that when you have a master director, a solid story, and the best actors around you have art. And props to Clint for demonstrating that simplicity is an element of mastery.",10,1,3,25 January 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Something extraordinary
","Ron Howard's 'A Beautiful Mind' is an extraordinary movie with a powerful performance from Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash. John Nash is the Princeton mathematician who wrote the founding paper on game theory, and has battled schizophrenia almost his entire adult life. In Crowe's acceptance speech at the Golden Globes, he said that '...Hopefully, we made a movie that made you believe that something extraordinary is possible.' Director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, and a talented cast have done so. Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman created a story about humanity, and a touching love story. Goldsman streamlined some of the events of Silvia Nasar's book, and maintained coherence. Howard does not compromise on the perception of the young John Nash, who was a genius, and also an arrogant loner-- not good with people. At the same time we have compassion for Nash's plight given an enlightened view of schizophrenia. The scene in which we discover Nash's condition is purely masterful on Howard's part. Nash's journey is amazing.Russell Crowe is simply awesome. He can convey what is in Nash's mind with either a look or in dialog. Crowe has such a range of intensity, and is always believable. Crowe's Nash ages 50 years over the course of the movie. At the core of the movie is a great love story. Jennifer Connelly is a revelation as Alicia Nash, John's wife. Connelly as Alicia says that John 'transforms into the man that she loves.' Connelly's Alicia has such a capacity for courage and doing what is right. She loves John. She stands by him and raises their family. Her Alicia suffers and remains strong. There are also great supporting performances from Christopher Plummer as Nash's psychiatrist, and from Ed Harris and Paul Bettany. John Nash won the Nobel Prize in 1994 and continues to teach at Princeton. He still accepts and deals with schizophrenia. This is very touching and truly a triumph of the human spirit. Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have created something extraordinary. They move, touch, and inspire us.",10,0,2,22 January 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The Smiths Rock
","The term 'chemistry' is often used to describe that ethereal quality in movies, and rarely is it used accurately or precisely. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie absolutely have 'it'. Consequently, Director Doug Liman's 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is one of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. When Pitt and Jolie are on screen, they could be in an elevator baring automatic weapons, not saying a word (which actually happens), and be simply captivating. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the screen's most stunning couple. Granted they are both simply beautiful, and charismatic presences. Though when they are on the screen together it is pure chemistry. Acknowledge Liman for keeping the romance in the foreground, in a well orchestrated action movie-- so to speak. This is no small accomplishment.Simon Kinberg wrote the screenplay for 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' 5 years ago as his Master's Thesis. I had read that his screenplay evolved through numerous rewrites. Kinberg's story has a novel premise. John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith have been married for 5 or 6 years (depending on whose account), and their marriage has gone stagnant. John is a successful contractor. Jane is the CEO of an Internet company. They live in a comfortable home in an up scale neighborhood. We are introduced to the Smiths in their marriage counseling session, where John asks for clarification in rating their sex life-- he wants to know if 10 or 1 represents the highest. This is an example of the wonderful touches Kinberg provides. Turns out that John and Jane are expert professional assassins working for rival companies-- unbeknown-st to each other. The story seems to imply that both rival companies are contracted to 'The Company', though this is inherently vague. Pretty much it seems that John and Jane's targets are 'bad guys'. When an FBI hostage, Adam Brody (Benjamin Diaz), is independently identified as their next job, their secrets are invariably revealed. Note this comes as no surprise, being this is the what the movie is advertised as. Predictably John and Jane become each other's next job. Now the fun really begins.Pitt and Jolie are really deft and skilled performers. They play their roles straight-- there is no winking at the camera. This is the real charm of 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'. You have smart and charming actors playing smart and charming characters in a preposterous situation. The sense of humor derives from the situations. Pitt as John is so at ease and natural, and proves he has a talent for comedy, because he is not trying to be funny. Pitt also gives John an underlying strength. Jolie as Jane has this amazing cool and composure that is completely charming. Jolie is also brilliant at providing Jane a hint of vulnerability. Pitt and Jolie can also crank up the intensity on a dime. One can tell that both are having fun making 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'. There is a hilarious and vicious fight scene where both are attempting to kill each other. In the cut away scene John is soccer kicking Jane, until she strategically kicks him. Liman then expertly tailors this to a character arc between John and Jane. Pitt and Jolie are amazing in this narrative and character shift. Ultimately, 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' is about the power of love and the value of relationships. This sets a touching carve-out in what is an exquisitely orchestrated action thriller. The movie also never takes itself seriously-- very smart.The Smiths may have gotten married as the perfect cover. Recalling how both met, their smoldering affair, and their present state of marriage, John and Jane must choose whether it is worth fighting for. There is some twisted humor in depicting a marriage where both partners are literally out to kill each other. Liman and Kinberg set up the joke and know that there is catharsis in the resolution. The bottom line is that love and honor are always worth fighting for. Always. So do Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are awesome in Doug Liman's very fun and captivating 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith'. I truly would love see 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith II'. Really.",9,4,9,14 June 2005
The Departed," Unforeseen Tragedy
","'The Departed' is captivating movie-making. 'The Departed' is not the year's Best Picture; although it seems destined for the Oscar gold. Director Martin Scorcese generates powerful and compelling performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, and Jack Nicholson. Writer William Monahan's story is based on the screenplay for 'Infernal Affairs' by Alan Mak and Felix Chong. 'The Departed' starts off great and has a stunning Act 2. However, Act 3 is horrible in the sense that the movie suddenly turns stupid, and then desperately and unconvincingly ties up loose ends. I think Martin Scorcese wants to demonstrate that along with his preoccupation with the darker side of humanity, he also has a sense of cinematic justice. This is a feeble attempt at best.The going in premise is an intriguing look into intertwined cultures from the perspective of cultural moles. Colin Sullivan is a smart sharp kid in Boston, virtually raised by Irish Mafia kingpin Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Colin (Matt Damon) becomes a Boston Police cadet and quickly rises through the ranks of the Boston Police Department. Sgt. Colin Sullivan remains beholding to Frank. Colin becomes a key player in a federal task force that infiltrates the Boston Irish Mafia. On the polar opposite, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a bright police cadet with questionable family ties which does not bode well for his career as a police officer. We witness Billy burying his dead mother. Billy's late father was a man of honor, an Airport worker who refused to join Frank Costello. Billy strikes a deal with Boston Police Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Detective Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) to go rogue undercover and disavowing any ties to the Department. Billy's job is to get in with Frank. Along the way Colin romances police staff psychiatrist Madolyn (Vera Farmiga). Farmiga has the thankless job of essentially portraying a plot device, as charming as she is.The performances in 'The Departed' are amazing. For that acknowledge Scorcese. Leonardo DiCaprio has grown into a powerful leading actorhe commands the screen. He is edgy and dangerous. It is puzzling that Matt Damon did not receive more acclaim for his role as insider Colin. Damon balances a slick soullessness and believable consuming desperation. Jack Nicholson as Frank displays unrecognizable restraint in a compelling performance. Ultimately, the script fails the movie. During an early scene in the movie Billy (DiCaprio) quotes Nathaniel Hawthorne. Detective Dignam (Wahlberg) makes the snide remark that he was expecting him to quote Shakespeare. Ironically, 'The Departed' is not great tragedy. It is not Shakespeare. Unfortunately, it seemly intended to be so. This in itself is tragic, given the promise of the story's premise and the superb cast. My friend Chuck said that 'The Departed' would have been great if it ended before devolving into senseless violence. His comment is brilliant and insightful. There is neither great catharsis nor any grand noble act in the end to redeem 'The Departed'. What we are left with is a harried mess. And that is truly a tragedy.",8,0,0,21 February 2007
War of the Worlds," The Good Dad
","Finally got around to seeing Steven Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' starring Tom Cruise. Spielberg and Cruise had collaborated before on the very novel and ambitious 'Minority Report'. A couple years ago when both announced that they were re-teaming on the big budget remake of H.G. Wells's 'War of the Worlds', I was both excited and puzzled. The original 'War of the Worlds' movie (not the Orson Wells radio broadcast), was for it's time a great science fiction flick, but void of a compelling human story. In keeping with the novel, Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' is still essentially an allegory for natural selection. However, I can now see what drew Spielberg and Cruise to this story which focuses on father, Ray Ferrier (Cruise) and his two kids, Rachel (the awesome Dakota Fanning), and Robbie (talented newcomer Justin Chatwin) in the midst of the devastating alien attack. Cruise's Ray is a divorced crane operator. He is an arrogant and selfish father, who is looking after his kids for the weekend while his ex-wife Mary Ann (a strong Miranda Otto) and her current husband are on a trip up state. Then the world literally comes to a stand still.The story by Josh Friedman and David Koepp has some great expository touches. For instance we learn through news clips and mostly through survivalist Harlan Ogilvy (the perfectly deranged Tim Robbins) that this war or attempted genocide had been planned for perhaps a million years. The alien weapons of mass destruction were planted underground at various sites around the world, awaiting a predetermined alien mobilization command. The special effects and CGI are cutting edge amazing. 'War of the Worlds' is visually stunning.Given all that, the alien threat is more background, and Spielberg directs our attention to the Ferrier family. In the very beginning, he establishes Ray (Tom Cruise) as a bad Dad. Cruise is effective and believable in portraying Ray's transformation to good Dad. There is a powerful scene where Ray must separate from his son Robbie (Chatwin). The scene is unexpectedly poignant. Justin Chatwin is a powerful young actor. Dakota Fanning is a true talent, becoming more accomplished with each role. Here as Rachel she is truly terrified, but always has her wits about her. She is always natural with a radiant presence. Ultimately, what distinguishes Steven Spielberg's 'War of the Worlds' is not the stunning visually effects, but it's story of family. It's the journey of a man learning to become a good father. That is compelling. So are the performances by Cruise, Danning, and Chatwin. Acknowledge too, Spielberg's inspired and deeply personal direction.",8,0,1,10 August 2005
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Good Karma
","Peter Sollett's 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' is the sweetest and most charming movie of the year. It is also hysterical. Yes, 'Nick and Norah' is predictable by virtue of being romantic comedy. However, Writer Lorene Scafaria's adaptation of Rachel Cohn and David Levithan's book is more than just teen angst and high jinx. 'Nick and Norah' surprises in its characters' authenticity, and here the journey is as joyous as the outcome. Scarfaria's screenplay may win an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay. It is that good. 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' has the genuine feel of last year's 'Juno', and the great music to back up its title.Michael Cera and Kat Dennings are amazing as Nick and Norah. Cera is perhaps a Tom Hanks slacker version. He nails the universal teen enduring the world with a big heart. Dennings gives a breakthrough performance. She is deceptively funny, pretty and very smart. In a wonderful scene gay band mate Thom (Aaron Yoo) says to Nicky, 'You still haven't figured it out yet?' The Beatles got it'I Want to Hold Your Hand'. He grabs Nick's hand and tells him, 'It's about this.' For temporarily obtuse Nicky, Thom is talking about Norah.Nick (Cera) is a high school senior and the straight bass player for the gay band 'The Jerk Offs', along with is buds Thom (Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron). As we first meet Nick, he comes off as a well intentioned pathetic loser. He records CD mixes of his favorite songs for his ex-girlfriend Tris (hot and vapid Alexis Dziena). Though it becomes immediately obvious that Nick is not at all a loser, and that Tris is beyond bitch. The latter of course is transparent to Thom and Dev, and lost upon Nick.Norah (Dennings) and her best friend Caroline (cute and scattered Ari Graynor) attend an all girls' school with Tris (Dziena). Tris painfully mocks and discards Nick's CDs. Norah, who listens to the CD discards, may have found her soul mate in Nick, whom she has never met. The thread that binds them all is finding the secret concert of their favorite band 'Where's Fluffy' somewhere in New York City. For director Sollett the city is a living and breathing character. He and Scarfaria also make the most hilarious and creative use of chewing gum.Dev and Thom coax Nick out of his self pity exile to play a gig at a club in the city. Norah and Caroline are also at the club, along with Tris and her 'mall stalker' boyfriend. Norah notices Nick playing in the band. Caroline remarks, 'You're practically blowing him with your eyes!' Under contrived circumstance Norah asks Nick to pose as her boyfriend for 5 minutes. Norah soon realizes that Nick is Tris's ex. It's Nick and Norah's karma.Cera and Dennings have amazing chemistry and heart which are the hallmarks of 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist'. We cheer for their Nick and Norah, because they are just decent and authentic souls. Their journey is wrought with angst, humor, and all heart. Nick ridiculously suffers over Norah's exTal (funny arrogant Jay Baruchel), who is her 'friend with benefits'. He still hasn't figured out that he and Norah are falling in love, and that Tris (Dziena) is all wrong.Cera perfectly plays Nick as a guy, who thinks way too much, when he should listen to his heart. Dennings embodies Norah as the girl, who really doesn't get that she is amazing, overshadowed in insecurity and compensating by having it all figured out. She can't see that she has it all over Tris. In a very nice scene Nick tells Norah, 'You're beautiful.' Cera and Dennings have many memorable moments be it arguing in Nick's yellow Yugo or Nick giving Norah his jacket to protect her from the cold. One that stands out: Norah while nursing drunken Caroline says to Nick, 'I was thinking about Brown It would be kind of nice knowing someone an hour away.' Nick gives Norah a moisten hand wipe from the last time his family had Chinese food. Smart funny writing, amazing performances, and good karma make 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist' among the year's best movies.",10,8,15,10 October 2008
Wedding Crashers," Surprising Wedding
","A bud of mine, Tom, is a master juggler in his spare time. I remember he showed me how to juggle, and the one thing he always did was keep his eye on the ball. This is what Director David Dobkin, does with 'Wedding Crashers', he keeps his eye on the ball or balls. Dobkin balances what appears to be an outrageous, laugh riot comedy that has something to offend everyone (really praise), with a touching and sweet romance. Dobkin diverts our attention, and surprisingly, the love story ends in the foreground. That being said, 'Wedding Crashers' will make you laugh harder than any other movie release so far this year. The humor shoots beyond tasteless at times, and is flat out clever funny. Credit the smart and crisp writing of Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. Faber and Fisher transform what could have been ordinary and predictable, i.e. the goof ball guy ends up with the wonderful girl, and avoids the trite ending. Faber and Fisher grant the audience the satisfying pay-out. 'Wedding Crashers' is also blessed with the genius comedic pairing of Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn.Wilson and Vaughn play John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, who are divorce mediators. Not attorneys. Mediators. Apparently, they are good at it. During the Wedding Season, they are master Wedding Crashers. They have found a brilliant way to eat great food, meet hot women, and get laid. John (Wilson) begins to question their vapid existence. Jeremy reminds him that one day when they're old they'll look back fondly at these days. John points out, 'We're not that young.' They decide to crash the Wedding of the Year. The daughter of Treasury Secretary Cleary (the perfectly cast Christopher Walken) is getting married. John and Jeremy do their research, and attend the wedding posing as investment bankers and distant nephews. Jeremy targets bridesmaid, Gloria Cleary (wild Isla Fisher). John is instantly entranced by her sister Claire Cleary (the amazing Rachel McAdams). During a funny exchange where John guesses wedding gifts, Claire asks John 'What do you think true love is?' John replies 'True love is the soul's recognition of it's counterpoint, in another.' Claire admits that is 'cheesy', and is touched. So was I, and completely taken off guard. 'Wedding Crashers' is a great movie in that it does so many different things in context.Needing more time with Claire, John convinces Jeremy to accept an invitation to the Cleary summer home. The Clearys are the poster dysfunctional family. Wife Kathleen Cleary (stunning Jane Seymour) making a pass at John, tells him that she and her husband were only faithful for the first 2 years of their marriage. Gloria (Fisher) is the entitled rich girl who had her 'Sweet Sixteen' when she was thirteen. Now she is literally draining the life out of her new sex toy and love, Jeremy (Vaughn). Todd Cleary (Keir O'Donnell) is the misunderstood gay son, who is also attracted to Jeremy. Claire (McAdams) is perfect aside from having a vicious jerk-head boyfriend, Sack Lodge (well played by Bradley Cooper). The Lodge's are an esteemed family, and Sack is some sort of environmental warrior. Basically he is a world-class ass. John tells Claire, 'You don't realize that you deserve to be with someone great...' The amazing thing in this context, John is not referring to himself.Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an awesome and classic comedic team. This time around Wilson plays the straight man, John, who falls for Claire. Wilson has his funny lines, though mostly it's his laid back charm and cool that work. He also displays a believable vulnerability. Vaughn is outrageous and displays comic timing genius. His Jeremy even thinks quicker than he speaks. He is pure swagger and confidence. It is hysterical that he is initially terrified by Gloria. What really underpins this comedy and romance, amazingly is the depth and substance of their relationship. After a particularly bad night at the Cleary's Jeremy asks for some alone time from John. What could have been a flip exchange ends up being very understated and sweet. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and completely captivating. Her Claire is smart with a blind-spot (that being Sack), funny, with a great soul. She is John's counterpoint. It's great to see Jane Seymour. She is gorgeous. Her 'Mrs. Robinson' scene with John (Wilson) is hot and hilarious. Christopher Walken is awesome as Secretary Cleary. He masterfully plays Cleary as self-absorbed on the surface, though he knows, and has unconditional love for his daughters.See 'Wedding Crashers'. Really. It will make you laugh out loud and possibly offend. It will also charm you.",10,1,4,30 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," Uncompromising 'Blood'
","In a telling confession Daniel Day-Lewis's Daniel Plainview says, 'I see the worst in people' The paradox is that you can't fool a man immersed in his own darkness. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazingly powerful as oilman Plainview in Director and Screenwriter Paul Thomas Anderson's stark and unforgiving 'There Will Be Blood'. Day-Lewis is uncompromising as a man, who forfeits his very soul for wealth and power, with his eyes wide-open. I think that Daniel Day-Lewis will win the Oscar. Based on the novel 'Oil' by Upton Sinclair, 'There Will Be Blood' tells the story of oilman Daniel Plainview at the turn of the 20th century. Daniel and his son H.W. (Dillion Freasier) forge an oil empire in California, but at the greatest of costs.Running at almost 2 hours and 40 minutes 'There Will Be Blood' is engrossing storytelling. 'There Will Be Blood' runs too long, dragging on in the middle. It is easy to despise and dismiss Daniel as an inhumane beast; however, it is the vestiges of humanity from Day-Lewis's performance and Paul Thomas Anderson's layered narrative that makes his decline into the abyss profoundly sad. There is an electrifying moment when Daniel screams, 'I've abandoned my boy!' You may have heard that the ending is brutally shockingwell, it is. However, it is strangely in context with character. Thomas Hardy said character is fate.A weird integrity is at play: Daniel Plainview is enraged and ruthless throughout. However, he is the only character that remains true to himself. Daniel also can spot a liar a mile away. This dynamic fuels the force of wills between Daniel and local church prophet Eli Sunday (insufferably pious and duplicitous Paul Dano). Director Anderson brilliantly disguises the surface as the conflict of faith, but is really about avarice. Robert Elswit's cinematography is breathtaking. Johnny Greenwood's musical score is almost a character itself evoking tension and grating nerves.'There Will Be Blood' evolves the story of Daniel and his son H.W. as they acquire land leases and drill for oil in 'Little Boston' in turn of the century California. There Daniel begins his empire, and clashes with evangelical Eli Sunday (Dano), whose motives may not be so transparent. Daniel also apparently reunites with his long lost half-brother Henry (good Kevin J. O'Connor). Daniel strikes oil and personal tragedy. Day-Lewis as Daniel is unnervingly chilling in a scene where he leaves the local train station. 'There Will Be Blood' explores the aftermath of the tragedy, and more poignantly the choices Daniel makes as he gradually relinquishes his very soul. There is blood, and more blood.Aside from some welcome brevity, Paul Thomas Anderson direction and narrative are nearly masterful. However, none of this would work without the commanding performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It seems that Daniel Day-Lewis revives from movie hibernation every 4 or 5 years to submit a stunning Oscar performance. He is powerful. Day-Lewis as Daniel is no saint nor is he a good man deep down. However, as portrayed by Day-Lewis we can never dismiss him as a monster, because we see his humanity gradually get beaten of him partly from circumstance and mostly by his own doing. Daniel Day-Lewis's performance absolutely compels, and ultimately provokes a profound sadness. 'There Will Be Blood' is disturbing and uncompromising work that is well worth watching.",9,1,6,14 February 2008
Ice Age," Part of the Herd
","Director Carlos Saldanha's animated feature 'Ice Age' starts ordinarily, then half way through it finds it's voice and says something remarkable about communities or 'herds'. This is a good surprise, and a welcome one. 'Ice Age' is 20th Century Fox's entry into cutting edge animated feature market. Techincally, it is not on par with some of the Disney or Dreamworks entries, though what makes it promising is that it has a worthwhile story to tell much like 'Shrek' and 'Monsters Inc.' Note that 'Shrek' and 'Monsters' are better movies. For one thing the story by Michael Wilson and the screenplay by Wilson and Michael Berg wastes time wandering in the first half, without really providing a context for what they really want to say. Our hero Manny, the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Ramano), is migrating south, though curiously alone. He is suffering over his family from his past. He saves a goofy sloth, Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) from a curious pair of male Rhinos-- a friend and I 'wondered' about the nature of their relationship. The reluctant Manny agrees to take on Sid as a traveling bud. Along the way Manny and Sid become involved in the dark plot of a Sabertooth Tiger pack to kidnap a human child. Manny rescues the child in the failed attempt, and the child joins their herd. Sabertooth Diego (voiced by the always edgy Denis Leary) is the Judas who joins Manny's herd, pretending to help lead the child back to safely-- he is really following the orders of his leader, the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic). However, Manny saves Diego's life. Diego asks why Manny risked his own life for his. Manny says '... That's what you do when you're part of a herd.' Now does Manny trust Diego, who is out to betray him? The 'Part of the herd' or this community conversation saves 'Ice Age', and offers value. Heroes and leaders can emerge from communities that are very diverse. And these are communities simply because they declared themselves to be--'Our herd'. Heroes and leaders emerging unexpectedly from communities are touching and inspiring-- what is cool that it is also expansive. Ultimately, 'Ice Age' along with Ramano, Leary, and Leguizamo gets the job done.",7,0,0,29 April 2002
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Funny Anchorman
","This summer I've seen several intentionally stupid funny movies, and enjoyed them. Adam McKay's 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' is no exception. Seems that my taste for high concept cinema has been influenced by the summer-- well not really. This movie written by McKay and it's star Will Ferrell is an outrageous and completely over the top comedy. Applaud Will Ferrell as the mind bendingly stupid and self absorbed, San Diego newscaster, Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrell is genius in playing Ron straight without character dispersions. Ferrell creates a great deadpan sense with his cohabiting dog, Baxter, and the fact that his character Ron Burgundy will read ANYTHING on the teleprompter, his tragic flaw, well at least one of several, is priceless. Ferrell also never crosses the line of being a complete jerk which is an amazing accomplishment. In fact, Ferrell gives Ron a muted charm-- he really does grow on you. Basically, 'Anchorman' is an extended sitcom. Ron is informed by his station manager, Ed (a funny Fred Willard), that he will have a co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone (a hot Christina Applegate). Turns out that Veronica was a woman whom was immune to Ron's vast charm at a wild news crew party. Veronica is beautiful, ambitious, and smart. She too has aspirations of being a Network Anchor. The Boys Club news crew which include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and the dumb as a post weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) all make their play for Veronica. However, she falls for Ron in spite of himself. Ron eventually woos her affections in a totally wacky jazz flute display. The screen writing is so skewed in a good way, and it has absolutely no shame. There is a classic scene with Ron's dog Baxter, and a bridge that according to my bud, John, shatters a fundamental script writing rule. In another memorable scene Ron gives an erroneous translation of the name San Diego to Veronica that is hilarious. 'Anchorman' also benefits from cameos of talented actors, most notably Vince Vaughn as Wes Mantooth, the rival station anchor. Christina Applegate looks great, and truly has a talent for comedy. 'Anchorman' is completely over the top, and ignores any boundaries. That really makes it work. 'Anchorman' is broad stroke farce done well. Will Ferrell demonstrates great comedic gifts. I want to see what he creates next. For now, 'Anchorman' is just great fun, and very funny stuff.",8,89,143,13 July 2004
The Wrestler," 'The Wrestler' is One of the Best
","'The Wrestler' is so very touching and poignant. Mickey Rourke is awesome. Darren Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler' is the best movie of the year. Mickey Rourke inhabits aging professional wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson with a profound authenticity. His performance resonates true. He gives Randy such heart, spirit, and humanity. At the telling story arc, Randy confesses to Cassidy (stunning Marisa Tomei), 'You know the only place I get hurt is out there' Randy loves wrestling more than life. The physical beating he experiences in the ring pales in comparison to the heart wrenching losses he endures in the real world. The screenplay by Robert Siegel is absolutely moving and inspiring-- perfect.Aronofsky creates an inspired vision, and all his performances are dead on. Marisa Tomei as aging mother and stripper Cassidy is astounding in her stark vulnerability. She and Rourke are not only literally nakedshe as the stripper and Randy in his tights, but emotionally bare, and fearless. Tomei in a quietly powerful scene tells Randy, 'I'm here. I'm really here' Evan Rachel Wood as Randy's estranged daughter Stephanie is powerful and uncompromising. Rourke has a heartbreaking scene where he asks for forgiveness from sullen Stephanie, 'I just don't want you to hate me Okay?' Then later in the scene Wood runs up beside Randy, and hugs his arm. That just touches your soul.Aronofsky touches the heart, and elicits such humanity and compassion in all the performances. Mickey Rourke put on about 40 pounds of muscle. His face, either from bad plastic surgery or prolonged steroid use, strangely distinguishes Randy's authenticity, or fosters profound empathy for his character. Deep down Randy is a good man, and a hero. Marisa Tomei, who is in her forties, looks amazing as stripper Cassidy. However, that is eclipsed by the mesmerizing vulnerability she breathes into Cassidy.'The Wrestler' follows Rourke's Randy 'The Ram' 25 years after his professional wrestling zenith. In the 80's 'The Ram' was The World Champion and the Hulk Hogan of his day. Now the aging and damaged Randy is relegated to weekend wrestling matches at local school gymnasiums for chump change. He works at a local market, and can't make enough money to make rent, getting locked out of his own trailer at a trailer park. Randy is sweet on Cassidy, who is a stripper at the local strip club. Cassidy is a single mom, and unlike Randy, knows her days as a stripper are numbered. Tough Cassidy has a soft spot for Randy, but she knows that hooking up would be a bad idea. Randy has a daughter in college, who wants nothing to do with him. Randy is literally a broken down 'piece of meat', held together by painkillers and steroids. Everyone on the circuit loves Randy, because he is such a good and decent soul. He always has a hug and 'How you doin' brother?' for his fellow wrestlers. Even his drug supplier cuts him slack when doesn't have the money.Randy suffers an unexpected physical tragedy, and is forced evaluate his life. Strangely, things begin to look up for Randy. He begins a relationship with Cassidy (Tomei). He makes peace with his daughter Stephanie (Wood). He lines up a reunion match against his legendary rival The Ayatolla (good Ernest Miller). However, big hearted Randy is cursed with his self-destructive nature. What Randy loves to do is wrestle. Wrestling is his life. For Randy getting beat up in the ring is less painful than the beating he has taken in life outside. That is the poignancy and nobility of Aronofsky's 'The Wrestler'. Mickey Rourke is stunning, compassionate, and powerful. He deserves to win an Oscar for the heartfelt courageous performance. Marisa Tomei is fearless and compelling as Cassidy, deserving an Oscar nod as well.'The Wrestler' is one of the most moving, and touching movies you will ever see. It is also one of the best movies you will ever see. .",10,0,1,20 January 2009
Hancock," You're a hero...
","During the dramatic arc in 'Hancock' Charlize Theron's Mary confesses to Will Smith's Hancock, 'You were built to save You're a hero.' 'Hancock' is an amazing surprise. Charlize Theron is awesome. Her powerful performance elevates 'Hancock'. Will Smith is the most charismatic movie star today, and is well deserved. His power not only derives from his swagger, but also from his humanity and compassion. With the caliber of Oscar Winner Theron and Nominee Smith in a superhero movie by Director Peter Berg, something compelling and special emerges. Along with Smith and Theron, Jason Bateman is terrific. Bateman is having a deserved resurgence coming off of 'Juno' and here in 'Hancock'. Writers Vy Vincent Ngo and Vincent Gilligan create a new and fresh superhero mythology in 'Hancock'. Director Berg provokes killer performances, and unexpectedly veers narrative direction as 'Hancock' transforms into the poignant homage to hero. Deep down like Bateman's Ray, we all want to 'Change the world.' Hero resonates to the soul.Hancock (Smith) has Superman-like powers: amazing strength, flight, great speed, and impervious to bullets. However, Hancock is a loner alcoholic superhero with a very bad attitude, and completely reckless. In the opening sequence Hancock subdues Asian gang members in a highway chase that costs the City of Los Angeles $9 million. Fortunately, Hancock saves Ray's life from a freight train accident. The grateful Ray (Bateman) thanks Hancock and invites him home to meet his family. Ray has a young son Aaron (cute Jae Head), who worships the renegade superhero. His beautiful wife Mary (Theron) strangely seems to recognize Hancock.Public Relations guy Ray offers his services to Hancock, who is a PR nightmare. Ray tells him, 'People don't like you, Hancock.' Mary is uneasy with Ray's good intentions. She says, 'You always see the good in people when there is none.' In guarded introspection Hancock agrees to accept Ray's offer. The Superhero image 'makeover' is not easy. Here Ngo and Gilligan hysterically poke fun at recent celebrity jail stints as means of public sympathy. The process where Ray teaches Hancock to say, 'Good job.' is hilarious.Predictably the true hero in Hancock emerges. Then the story takes a surprising dramatic twist. In a quiet moment Hancock recalls his past and he says, 'I must have been some kind of bastard that no one came back to claim me' Will Smith has cool gravitas that grounds 'Hancock'. He is a great looking charismatic leading man, with a deceptive poignancy. Charlize Theron is the most strikingly beautiful actress on screen. As an actor she wields such amazing will and power. She can shift from light and whimsical to stark intensity without missing a beat. Watching Smith and Theron together on screen is truly captivating. Their chemistry is electric. Jason Bateman is funny and compelling as Ray. Bateman embodies the soul of a very decent and caring man, who is stronger than he knows.'Hancock' is about reclaiming one's greatness in the morass of circumstance, and love everlasting. It's about being a hero, and wanting to change the world for good. Director Peter Berg always keeps this theme in the foreground. He balances both a sense of humor and gravity. Berg possesses a great action sense for the dramatic. The bank hostage scene is cool and slick. The final conflict is an epic thrill ride infused with great pathos.I really enjoyed and cheered for 'Hancock'. It is a great hero story. 'Hancock' is inventive, fresh, and completely entertaining. Will Smith powerfully delivers. Charlize Theron is totally amazing. Definitely, see 'Hancock'.",10,6,13,5 July 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Breaking My Heart...
","When a pregnant Pademe (Natalie Portman) confronts her husband, Anikan (Hayden Christensen), after he has chosen his path down the Dark Side of The Force in 'Star Wars: Episode III-- Revenge of the Sith', she cries, '...You're breaking my heart!' And for the first time in the movie's trilogy, this one does have a heart. For the most part it was worth the wait. Writer and Director George Lucas in the end has redeemed his saga of classic tragedy set 'a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.' Lucas's Episode III even with it's weaknesses (patches of dialog and over exposition), has genuine pathos and drama. Episode III is perhaps the most visually stunning movie ever made. Though what had plagued this series was the storytelling.Acknowledge Lucas for the classic tale's redemption-- which was not easy. Everyone, well most of popular culture, knows that this part of the story does not end well. Anikan Skywalker (Christensen) will become the evil and powerful Darth Vader, the apprentice of the Emperor and Sith Lord (Ian McDiarmid) as they rule the Galaxy. Vader's character arc does not complete until the next trilogy. So the story rests solely on Christensen's Anikan, and whether his choice down the Dark Side is believable and empathized. For the most part Christensen does this, amidst some awkward dialog. Toward the end, he commands a powerful dark presence.Episode III starts off with an awesome rescue by Anikan and Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) of the abducted Chancellor (McDiarmid) by Droid Leader, General Grevious (Mathew Wood). Anikan demonstrates great power and rage in defeating Count Dooku (Christopher Lee). Anikan and Obi-Wan return as heroes from the mission. Apparently, Anikan's marriage to Padme (Portman) is still a secret and a little far fetched in context. Padme has great news: she is pregnant. At the same time Anikan's close relationship with the Chancellor leads to an appointment to the Jedi Council as his personal representative. However, Anikan is snubbed as Council Member. Both Yoda (Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) have become wary of Anikan. Anikan even seeks counsel of Master Yoda regarding his troubling dreams, who tells him that he must 'let go of all that you are afraid to lose.' As powerful as Anikan has become he was unable to save his mother, and never let this go. He vows that will never happen to Padme. Never. Thus, his noble intention and attachment lead him down the Dark Side. This is very sad, and a tragic fall from grace. Obi-Wan says to Anikan, '...I loved you.'Lucas seems to say in Episode III, that no one is truly born evil. Rather that the choice down the Dark Side or Path may start with a noble intention, but when it is clouded by fear and anger there in lies the curse. Great commentary. In that end, Hayden Christensen gives a solid performance. He physically bulked up for the role, is a great looking man, and gives Anikan a powerful dark presence, particularly toward the end. He gives Anikan the right vulnerability and anger. Ewan McGregor is the conscience of Episode III. His Obi-Wan is the true hero, believing in the best in people, even Anikan. McGregor is noble, brave, and deeply compassionate. Natalie Portman's Padme is Episode III's soul. Her heart break as she watches the man she loves, transform into someone she does not know is amazing. Portman's performance is stunning. Finally, Samuel L. Jackson as Mace Windu is able to demonstrate his warrior courage. Jackson is very strong here. Like all of Episode III. George Lucas and company have done good. Great, in fact.",9,4,7,21 May 2005
Inception," Perchance to Dream
","In 'Inception' Ellen Page's dream architect Ariadne asks Leonardo DiCaprio's haunted Cobb, 'Why is it so important to dream?' Hamlet contemplated death saying: 'To sleep: perchance to dream.' All is not as it appears. Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's 'Inception' is the most original movie of the last 5 years. Nolan takes 'Inception' quantum levels beyond his 'Memento'. 'Inception' is simply awesome. My bud Darin cautioned that one has to focus intently during the first 20 minutes of 'Inception', and then it really gets confusing. Master storyteller Nolan takes us on a wild ride and circles back and completes all of the story arcs and threads. Leonardo DiCarprio is powerful. He plays Dom Cobb, a corporate espionage specialist whose explicit gift is extracting people's dreams. He is hired by ruthless CEO Saito (charismatic Ken Watanabe) to liquidate a rival corporation.Cobb must do the impossible and create a dream in Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the surviving son of Saito's corporate rival. This is inception, which Cobb reminds Saito has never been done before. And Cobb is lying. He is a flawed tragic hero, who literally imprisons a dark secret. He is a fugitive living abroad, offering his specific service. Inception may be his last chance at redemption for his very soul and reuniting with his young son and daughter.Cobb assembles his team. He returns to visit his mentor Miles (solid and great Michael Caine) at a university in Paris. Cobb enrolls Miles's best student Ariadne (spirited and smart Ellen Page) as his dream architect. Apparently, you can get a PhD in dream architecture in Paris—go figure. In a visually stunning display of manipulated dreams Paris literally bends sideways. Ariadne has an innate gift and is totally hooked. Perceptive Ariadne discerns that Cobb is a deadly liability to the mission—he is haunted by dreams of his wife Mal (captivatingly suffering Marion Cotillard). Cobb tells Ariadne to create dreams anew, never from memories. Apparently, Cobb is violating his own rule.In Chris Nolan's construct, dreams have 3 defined levels. The fourth level is the subconscious, an eternity of desire and fear. Also because the mind accelerates in deeper levels of dreams, we experience a dream time dilation—an homage to Einstein? In this dream math: something like 20 seconds is 20 minutes in level 1, 2 hours in level 2, 2 weeks in level 3, and on the order of years in level 4. Nolan meticulously orchestrates all elements as a van plunges into a river. There is the distinct danger that one may be lost for a lifetime in the subconscious—imprisoned and unable to escape for eternity. So the 2.5 hours of 'Inception' would be—I kid. Ironically, Cobb and all involved are willing to risk this for merely money and corporate gain.What occurs as peculiar in Act 2 in level 3 of the dream is the James Bond-like commando raid on the snow covered fortress. Outwardly, this seems very cheesy. Then the story focuses on Fischer's memories of his disapproving father. Further beneath Cobb must reconcile the ghosts of his wife or forever be lost. Cillian Murphy is surprising in his quiet humanity and power. DiCaprio is powerful and commanding throughout. Nolan generates the space for creation. DiCaprio effortlessly is just being, and is so compelling. For me, 'Inception' resonates in these 2 poignant story arcs. Particularly, with Murphy's Fischer there is amazing catharsis, even in retrospect it may have been manufactured. Nolan is brilliant. I think in 'Inception' memories are just memories—it is the stories we create about them that either empower us or imprison us. In the end Nolan comes full circle and completes the journey, then in the last frame he makes us wonder. Chris Nolan is the master storyteller—enthralling us and always making us consider the possibilities.",10,4,11,6 August 2010
Lord of War," Just Evil Prevails
","Atop a hillside in Liberia overlooking an impending village massacre once the arms deal settles, Nicolas Cage's Yuri pleads to his conscience rattled brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), 'It is none of our business!' Writer and Director Andrew Niccol's 'Lord of War' is all about the big business of war, and the cost of selling one's soul. That lost soul is Yuri Orlov played masterfully by Nicolas Cage. Cage as Yuri also narrates the story. Niccol sets the warped and dark tone in the opening sequence of the manufacture of a bullet to its final destinationso to speak. Yuri comments that there is one firearm for every 12 people in the world. So the question is 'How do we arm the other eleven?' Niccol's 'Lord of War' is not so much a clever indictment of humanity, rather an acknowledgment of perhaps humanity's darker nature. In a poignant and chilling realization for Yuri (Cage) he says, 'They say that 'evil prevails when good men fail to act.' It should be 'evil prevails'.' I don't think this is cynicism on Niccol's part, rather only stating what is so given all of history and now. He certainly makes us think from the inside out.Yuri Orlov (Cage) is from a Ukrainian family in Little Odessa, NY. As a young man he has an epiphany witnessing a Russian mafia hit. Being an arms dealer is the path to success. He finds that he also has an innate gift for his chosen profession. He enlists his brother Vitaly (Leto) into the business. 'Lord of War' traces the Orlov brothers over the course of 20 yearsthrough the end of the Cold War to the advent of terrorist threats and dictatorships in third world countries. Yuri truly becomes the Lord of War supplying arms to anyone and any country for a profit. He also acts as an independent agent for undisclosed countries supplying arms to 'freedom fighters'. One gets the drift. Yuri eventually hits his stride and becomes very successful and very wealthy. He marries his trophy bride, supermodel Ava Fontaine (stunning Bridget Moynahan), has a son, and living in a luxury apartment in Manhattan. All the while he eludes the grasp of Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (very good Ethan Hawke), by keeping three steps ahead. Predictably Yuri's world comes crashing in upon him. In a powerful scene with Ava who purposely ignores what her husband really does for a living, Yuri has a conscience meltdown.The actors in 'Lord of War' are great. Nicolas Cage is such a powerful and versatile actor. I don't think any other actor than himself, could enroll sympathy as arms dealer Yuri. Cage gives Yuri a subtle detached edge and an expert in context. Cage knows he is in morally bankrupt position, and he uses his smarts and sense of humor to rationalize that he only supplies the weapons to men who do evil. Yuri is the ultimate poster child for 'Guns don't kill people. People kill people.' Jared Leto is surprising as the coke head brother, who eventually cops to the monster he has becomethe counterpoint to Yuri. Bridget Moynahan is deceivingly powerful as Ava, the former model aware that her asset of being pretty is fading, and closes her eyes to what her husband does until it is too late. Moynahan is stunningly beautiful and has distinctive grace and vulnerability. Ethan Hawke as Jack Valentine is the intrepid idealist saving the world from the likes of Yuri. Hawke is very strong and compelling.Andrew Niccol's 'Lord of War' ends and the world continues on. The echoes of Yuri voice, just 'evil prevails' is a chilling and poignant reminder. Nicolas Cage is brilliant as the lost soul in 'The Lord of War'. 'The Lord of War' is one the year's best.",10,381,447,1 October 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Not Exactly Elementary
","In Director Guy Ritchie's vision renowned detective Sherlock Holmes is a martial artist and extreme intellect. Surprisingly, Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes' is more action movie than moody whodunit piece. In some ways this is strangely entertaining seeing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as an action buddy movie. Both Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are up to the task as Holmes and Watson. Downey is amazing as Sherlock Holmes embodying an aloofness, keen intellect, and physicality in the role. Law is charismatic, comical, and dashing as Watson. Their friendship is almost marriage like with the intermittent bickering and underlying love for each other. Which glaringly points to forced romance involving Holmes's former love thief Irene Adler played by Rachel McAdams. I am a fan of McAdams; however, her character seems more plot device and narrative foreshadowing of Holmes's greatest nemesis. The story and screenplay by Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, Simon Kinberg, and Lionel Wigram surrounds the evil Lord Blackwood (malevolent Mark Strong), who apparently returns from the dead to end the world as we know it. So it is up to Holmes and Watson to foil the evil and powerful Blackwood. Having these many writers involved is usually not a coherently good sign. At times it is not. In the opening sequence Holmes dispatches Blackwood's henchman with martial arts precision. Apparently, Holmes's vast knowledge of human anatomy and his brawling avocation make him a dangerous marital artist. According to Ritchie this resembles the Doyle character. Watson is also a formidable fighter, despite his war injury. Watson wields his cane as a deadly weapon itself. Downey got shredded for the movie, and Law looks lean and strong. In 'Sherlock Holmes' Holmes and Watson apprehend Lord Blackwood before he murders another young girl in a ceremonial Black Arts sacrifice. Blackwood is sentenced to be hanged. His last request is a visit from Holmes. He warns Holmes, 'You must widen your gaze' Apparently, not everything is as it seems. Lord Blackwood seemingly returns from the dead to exact his revenge. The perplexed Holmes seeks to uncover the truth. That supernatural storyline is engaging. What is really entertaining is the 'Odd Couple' storyline of roommates Holmes and Watson. Turns out, Watson is engaged to capable and beautiful Mary Morstan (strong Kelly Reilly); thus, threatening Holmes's relationship to Watson. Downey is at his arrogantly funny best as he exposes Mary at dinner with Watson. At about the same time Irene (McAdams) shows up enrolling the aid of Holmes to find a man. Irene may be blackmailed into doing so—all very mysterious. There are a lot of loose threads throughout 'Sherlock Holmes' aside from the Blackwood storyline. Even that one is 'elementary' in the words of the famous detective. Downey and Law however, engage and compel throughout. Often at odds, we know that their life and death bond is one of respect and love. That shameless bravado and the charisma of Downey and Law make 'Sherlock Holmes' worth watching. And we can look forward to Sherlock Holmes's greatest nemesis in the sequel, perhaps.",8,1,3,31 December 2009
WALL·E," WALL-E has great heart
","'WALL-E' accomplishes nearly the impossible. During the first half of the movie 'WALL-E' charms and mesmerizes without any vestige of human dialog. WALL-E is a refuse collecting robot, basically a box with two round camera eyes, left behind on Earth in the distant future. That would be 750 years in the future. Undeniably WALL-E (brilliantly voiced by Ben Bartt) is becoming sentient. In fact the cute robot is a passionate fan of the classic movie 'Hello, Dolly'. Clearly and touchingly, our hero WALL-E is profoundly lonely, and yearns for companionshipperhaps, even love. Perhaps this is a leap of faith beyond mere disbelief, and the distinct beauty of Director and Writer Andrew Stanton's amazing animated feature 'WALL-E' from Pixar.Pixar is now something like 10 for 10 in making movies that capture and connect with the audience. The CGI and animation are like nothing seen before. In fact the sequences with WALL-E on the desolate Earth wasteland look like live action film. Andrew Stanton's weird and wonderful robot love story also delivers humorously biting commentary on the sedentary direction of our society; as well as punctuates the consequences of not being 'green'. 'WALL-E' is brilliantly whimsical, hysterical, and surprisingly touching. 'WALL-E' like its hero has a big heart. 'WALL-E' tells its story on a vast visually stunning canvas: The CGI and animation are beyond amazing.As we first observe WALL-E, he is doing his programmed deal of collecting and compacting trash in one of Earth's barren metropolises. WALL-E discovers a living plant in the midst of all the garbage. Perhaps this newfound plant indicates that the Earth may again have a viable ecosystem, after over 750 years. A gargantuan space ship arrives, carrying with it a scouting robot, sleek new age Eve (charmingly voiced by Elissa Knight). Apparently, Eve is searching for any signs of life on the long vacated Earth. Obviously, more technologically advanced and powerful Eve appears formidable. However, WALL-E sees in Eve the love of his lifeat least for a robot. Robot hi-jinx ensues. Inevitably WALL-E ends up accompanying Eve back to the displaced human civilization, albeit unintentionally. Ironically WALL-E may be the savior of all of mankind. WALL-E and Eve's adventure becomes a hysterical and ultimately touching journey. 'WALL-E' is high on cute and fun.Director Stanton creates and navigates contrasting worlds of 'WALL-E' with ease and confidence. Granted the visuals awe and amaze; however, his storytelling yields 'WALL-E' its big heart. The fact that the main characters are robots with virtually monosyllabic vocabularies is even more stunning an accomplishment. You really pull for the happy ending for WALL-E and Eve. And they are robots! Okay, this is a Disney and Pixar movie, so you need not worry too much. 'WALL-E' is sentimental, very sweet, with enough of a quirky edge to keep you guessing. 'WALL-E' is a great movie, well worth seeing. Pixar has done it, again.",10,4,8,6 July 2008
Arrival," Life Arises in 'Arrival'
","'Arrival' is beautiful. The first 3 minutes tell the heartfelt story of Mother and Daughter with few words. It fondly reminds of the movie 'Up'. The story resonates to our very souls. Here crying at the beginning of a movie is a good thing. All is not exactly what it seems, illuminating untold possibilities to come. That is part of the beauty of 'Arrival'. Amy Adams as Louise narrates, 'There are days that define your story.' 'Arrival' embraces life in absolutely surprising ways.Eric Heisserer wrote the screenplay based on Ted Chiang's 'Story of Your Life'; its title starts making sense. This is much more than an alien encounter movie. Director Denis Villenueve's 'Arrival' is about the power of stories to inspire and define life. Amy Adams is amazing as Dr. Louise Banks, the linguistics professor, who must decipher the language and intentions of alien visitors to Earth. Adams embodies graceful humanity as Louise in her transformational journey from fear to wonder. Life is created and exists in our language. 'Arrival' reminds us. The sights and sounds of 'Arrival' awe. Composer Johann Johannsson's score effortlessly captures the currents of emotion. Bradford Young's cinematography is brilliant. From the enormous scale of the Alien monoliths around the world to the isolation of Louise's room, he seamlessly fuses the story with clarity. Villenueve orchestrates these sights, sounds, and authentic performances to tell a story that moves us. Dr. Louise Banks (Adams) is a single linguistics professor at a university. On the day that defines her story, 12 alien onyx monoliths about 1500 feet tall hover around the world. Their locations include China, Russia, and Montana. The aliens come from another world. Do they come in peace? Literally landing at her doorstep, Army Colonel Weber played by all business Forest Whitaker inquires whether Louise is the right person to decipher the alien language and their intentions. He soon determines she is. Soon Louise finds herself on a military helicopter flying to Montana with Alien Team lead physicist Ian Donnelly, played by Jeremy Renner. Ian tells Louise that science is the key to civilization, not language as her book proclaims. Yeah, they're going to bond. The monolith pods open every 18 hours, and Louise, Ian, and Weber must discover as much as they can. The strange creatures have seven tentacles; thus, giving them the name heptapods. Their oral language is indiscernible. However, their written language is like Japanese calligraphy circles with telling attributes. Watching Louise and Ian decode the language is mesmerizing; however, the story slows to a narrative crawl. Perhaps, the only downside. The upside is amazing. Paradoxically, the alien language is nonlinear: There is no past or future, only the present. Or maybe they are collapsed and all the same? All the while Louise is haunted by visions of her daughter. The Aliens possess a technology that may be a threat or a gift. Life arises out of our language. Villenueve and Heisserer guide us with lyrical focus, and a welcome sense of humor. Louise tells a killer 'kangaroo' joke. Amy Adams makes 'Arrival' special. She has power. Adams instills in Louise the vulnerability and compassion that speaks to the hero in all of us. Renner is deceptively strong and tender in what could have been a predictable role. His authentic partnership with Adams generates the eloquent and sublime epiphany. 'Arrival' invites us to make the story of our lives wondrous. 'Arrival' is one of the best movies of the year.",10,6,16,17 November 2016
The Blind Side," Plain Decency
","Sandra Bullock catches our attention when her Leigh Anne Tuohy says, 'Don't you dare lie to me!' She had asked Big Mike (silently strong Quinton Aaron) if he had a place to sleep for the night in the pouring rain. Bullock commands the screen in 'The Blind Side'. She is smart, sassy, and strong—brilliantly deflecting a gentle soul not easily moved. My friend Robert told me, 'Sandra Bullock rocks!' That says it all. I also think that Bullock gets an Oscar nod for her heart felt and powerful performance. Director and Writer John Lee Hancock's 'The Blind Side' is based on the book by Michael Lewis which tells the inspiring true story of Michael Oher. Oher was a homeless black kid, taken in by the Tuohy family, who became an All-American Football Player drafted in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens. Oher is now starting left offensive lineman—protecting the quarterback's blind side. 'The Blind Side' celebrates the decency in all people. I was touched by and enjoyed 'The Blind Side'. And much like the title, one is blind sided by the decency of people. I love this movie.Leigh Anne (Bullock) is married to Taco Bell franchise king Sean Tuohy (solid Tim McGraw). She has two kids, daughter Collins (smart and pretty Lily Collins) and son S.J. (scene stealing Jae Head). Collins is a volleyball star and cheerleader. S.J. is the precocious kid with his finger in everything. Leigh Anne is an interior designer, who often lunches on $18 salads with her lady friends. Her life changes when she chooses to take hulking Big Mike (Aaron) into the family. Director Hancock punctuates family throughout the movie. Early on Big Mike tells Leigh Anne that he doesn't like being called 'Big Mike'. Leigh Anne obliges, 'I'll call you Michael.' And when they shop for clothes in his old neighborhood, Michael reminds Leigh Anne, 'I got your back.' This is the amazing and endearing thread of 'The Blind Side'—it's about protecting your own, protecting family. At the narrative arc Bullock fearlessly stares down a street thug, 'You threaten my son! You threaten me!' In another great scene, Leigh Anne storms onto the football practice field, and instructs Michael how to play the game. She says, 'This team is your family Are you going to protect the family, Michael?' The soul of 'The Blind Side' is Bullock and her touching relationship with Michael authentically played by Quinton Aaron. Aaron is deceptively expressive and strong. He movingly narrates his essay that the only thing that matters is honor. At the story arc, Michael tells Leigh Anne, 'Don't you dare lie to me!' Really this is Bullock's movie. She amazes throughout with her spirit, compassion, and her powerful silence. When Leigh Anne makes up Michael's room, he tells her that he never had a bed before. Bullock walks to her room, and sits on her bed in solace. When Michael's crack addicted Mother tells Leigh Anne that she doesn't want Michael to see her the way she is, Bullock sits next to her and holds her hand in silence. And we are in awe as well.Everyone is amazing in 'The Blind Side'. Lily Collins as Collins ditches her girlfriends to keep company with Michael in the school library. She confides, 'It's like were studying together at home.' Jae Head S.J. is simply awesome when he asks the recruiting Coaches, 'So what's in it for me?' Tim McGraw is solidly understated when Leigh Anne asks him, 'Am I a good person?' Kathy Bates rules as Michael's tutor Miss Sue.The only goofy narrative twist involves NCAA Investigator Granger (in your face Sharon Morris). Granted this seems like a plot device, because we kind of know how this true story goes. This is a minor distraction, because at the core of 'The Blind Side' is family, honor, and unconditional love. There is such a great moment when Michael tells Leigh Anne, 'You need to give me a proper hug.' 'The Blind Side' just touches your soul.",10,4,9,23 November 2009
Parasite," 'Parasite' Crosses the Line
","In the midst of Writer and Director Bong Joon Ho's 'Parasite' wealthy Korean High-Tech CEO Dong-ik Park, played by handsome bold Sun-kyun Lee, describes to his wife Yeon-kyo, played by beautifully capricious Yeo-jeong Jo: His new driver Kim, played by brilliantly overwhelmed Kang-ho Song. Dong-ik says of Kim, 'He never crosses the line.' Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim.Paradoxically, Bong's 'Parasite' purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. 'It's all about them'. In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung.Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go.Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin.Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee.Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. NaÃ¯ve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life.Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times. Surprise twists reveal. The absurd hysterical devolves into absurd hysteria. I believe Bong's inventive madness does serve his purpose.In the quiet scene at the Park home, Ki-woo sadly yearns while looking upon all the beautiful rich people at a Birthday party. It's his life that might have been. Rather, it's his life that isn't.Director Bong brazenly explores the very fringes of sociopathy with both artistic style and menacing humor in 'Parasite'. His narrative is ultimately about karma. Absolutely there are consequence for what we do. What we do, can and will come back at us.Yes, 'Parasite' is darkly hysterical, in your face provocative. It's great to look at with authentic performances. 'Parasite' might be one of best movies of 2019. I really liked the movie a whole lot.All that being said: 'Parasite' is not my very favorite movie of 2019. Perhaps, humanity by its very design is dark and light. At least for me, 'Parasite' fails in its balance of the dark and the light. Again, just saying.",10,14,21,3 January 2020
Never Back Down," So it's on me...
","'Never Back Down' is cheesy, but it gets a pass for capturing the paradox of martial artsalbeit clumsily. Director Jeff Wadlow and Writer Chris Hauty's 'Never Back Down' is set in the world of mixed martial arts, perhaps its solely inventive aspect. The movie is derivative of 'The Karate Kid' and 'Rocky'. Sean Faris, who looks like Tom Cruise-- only tall and much younger, plays Jake Tyler, who is also the classic Cruise character: the brooding loner with an incomplete relationship with his dead father. In 'Never Back Down' inspired by the presence of Djimon Hounsou's Jean Roqua and Faris's Jake, one trains very hard so that one never has to fight. But when one has to fight or take a stand, it's about honor-- not revenge or pride. Roqua reminds Jake, 'It's your responsibility to control the outcome' An eloquent interpretation is: You must be at cause in the matter. 'Never Back Down' is shamelessly pedantic at times. Then again what is often trite has a familiar resonance. Roqua tells Jake, in whom he sees greatness and great anger, 'Everyone's got their fight.' That fight may be against a powerful opponent or against oneself. Therein lies the characters' catharsis, and Hounsou and Faris are very strong. The mixed martial arts are flashy and bloody, and the romance is a formulaic afterthought. That being said, 'Never Back Down' gets it right for honor and family.We first see Jake (Faris) as the devastating Iowa high school linebacker, who literally takes out five other players when one of the opposing team players taunts him about his father's death. Jake's football career ends. Jake, his brother Charlie (Wyatt Smith) and their mom Margot (strong Leslie Hope) move to Florida. Charlie has a scholarship at a Florida tennis academy. Apparently, Jake has been in persistent trouble since his father's death, and something remains unresolved. During the move, Jake stores his Dad's belongings in a box labeled 'Useless Junk'. Margot is at a loss for what to do with Jake. She too may hold him responsible for his father's death.In English class Jake rescues beautiful Baja (Amber Heard), by pointing out that the shield of Achilles in 'The Iliad' represents the alternative to war. Okay, this is little heavy handed on Writer Hauty's part. Baja invites Jake to a party. Jake smitten by her, accepts. However, this is a set up. Jake's football brawl on YouTube made him a celebrity, and also a target for Baja's boyfriend Ryan McCarthy (arrogant and totally ripped Cam Gigandet). Ryan is a rich kid and an expert mixed martial artist. Although he is all heart, Jake gets his ass kicked convincingly. However, his spirit attracts the attention of Max (geeky Evan Peters). Max tells Jake that he should train with his mixed martial arts instructor Jean Roqua (Hounsou), who learned from the Gracies' in Brazil. Reluctantly, Jake begins training. Roqua sees the great anger in Jake, but he also sees a great young man that will emerge. For Roqua it is all about training, discipline, and character. His rule is: You fight outside; you don't come back. Predictably, treachery and tragedy arise and Jake must choose his path in the realm of an underground mixed martial arts tournament. Jake comes to the realization, 'So it's on me?' And it always has.The major weakness of the movie is Amber Heard as Baja. Heard is very pretty and charming. However, her Baja is reprehensible. This is more a failing of Hauty. Baja may have been Ryan's pawn, but she still initially set Jake up. Clearly, she could have figured the consequences given what an arrogant jerk Ryan isshe is not stupid by a long shot. Baja is only forgiven, because Jake mans up and accepts responsibility for that particular outcome. Otherwise, the other performances are solid. Gigandet is a surprise, particularly at the end. He is charismatic and cocky, but is no coward underneath it all. Hounsou is powerful and compassionate as mentor Roqua. Sean Faris has star presence. He is a great looking actor with amazing intensity. He has also displays a wry sense of humor, and a natural vulnerability.'Never Back Down' is cheesy, predictable, and derivative. It also has some amazing mixed marital arts action, and strong performances. 'Never Back Down' really surprises with its story of honor and courage. Take a chance on 'Never Back Down'.",8,3,10,18 March 2008
Prometheus," Lost Fire in Prometheus
","'Prometheus', Director Ridley Scott's much anticipated 'Alien' prequel that is not the prequel, is amazing for the first hour. I saw it in 3D IMAX—it is like nothing you have seen before. In the last half hour 'Prometheus' collapses into manic action, suffering from the weaker story by Writers Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof. Ominously, chillingly calm Charlize Theron as Weyland Corporate Lead Meredith Vickers warns her surprise passenger, 'If you go down there, you're going to die.' Theron and Michael Fassbender as duplicitous android David are awesome. However, given the vibrant promise of its beginnings and despite some logic glitches, 'Prometheus' dismantles as a thriller, and disappointingly fails to answer captivating questions or ask compelling new ones.In Greek mythology, Prometheus was the god who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to Man. For that Prometheus suffered eternal punishment. I think Scott's grand ambition in 'Prometheus' was to search for the answer to 'Where did we come from?' In the opening scene, Scott is inspired. Eons ago a pale skinned, bald, humanoid creature with a shredded body stands atop the majestic waterfall in the presence of an alien ship. The creature drinks a mysterious potion. Spaihts and Lindelof lead us to believe this event altered human life on Earth as we know it.In 2089, archaeological scientists Elizabeth Shaw and her lover Charlie Holloway, played by Noomi Rapace and Logan Marshall-Green, uncover a pictograph star map in the caves in the Scottish Highlands. That in context with other pictographs sourced from distinct cultures, point to human life on Earth originating from the distant constellation of our creators, whom Shaw refers to as 'Engineers'. She enthusiastically says this is an 'Invitation' to meet our creators. Paradoxically, Shaw has faith in God as she begins this journey, to discover answers she doesn't really want to hear. Given the masterful set up, I think 'Prometheus' fails to honor the journey or elicits the transformed questions. This is too bad, because what remains is great.After a 2 year journey, the spaceship Prometheus arrives at its destination on an Earth-like moon in a distant solar system. Elderly and charismatic Peter Weyland CEO of Weyland industries, played by solid and unrecognizable Guy Pearce, financed the trillion dollar venture to discover our origins. Perhaps dying Weyland has another agenda as well. Weyland's surrogate son is android David, played by Fassbender. Fassbender is powerful balancing David's trained humanity and deathly curiosity. That curiosity is perhaps his tragic flaw. While the rest of the crew is in bio-stasis, David studies being human from watching Peter O'Toole in 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Fassbender nails the eeriness. Theron is lean and fit with the icy stunning veneer covering Vickers's darker soul. Theron is spectacular in another evil turn as in 'Snow White and the Huntsman'. She and Fassbender have a powerful scene revealing their past bond. What is really going on with this mission? Noomi Rapace may be miscast in 'Prometheus'. She is spirited and faithful. Rapace radiates intelligence and innocent curiosity. She is strong, particularly in a shocking self-surgery scene. I don't think she is enrolling in the transformation to hero. That may also be the result of Spaihts and Lindelof's nebulous dramatic arc.Scott filmed some of 'Prometheus' in Iceland, so the moon has an existential air with the spectacular lava rock and ice. The crew discovers amazing pyramids—remnants of the 'Engineers'. Scott creates Gothic images of dark caverns populated with metal modules, and gigantic stone statues. What happened to this god-like race? What is the deadly menacing force at bay? Here is perhaps the tie to 'Alien'. Somehow all the interesting questions are forsaken as 'Prometheus' propels into action overdrive. David says, 'Big things have small beginnings.' I think Prometheus deserves a big ending as well, instead of just a loud one.",8,4,10,11 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Only love can save the world...
","Love creates the hero in awesome 'Wonder Woman'. In the touching moment of the climactic battle Gal Gadot's Diana sources power from her memories of those she loves, and those who love her. Her bold strong Aunt Antiope played by Robin Wright, who taught her to be the fiercest Amazon Warrior, implores her, 'You are stronger than this!' Upon leaving her home to save the world her Mother Hippolyta, played by sublime Connie Nielsen, hugs Diana, 'You have been my greatest love. Today, you are my greatest sorrow' Steve played by Chris Pine, who loves Diana, says, 'I can save the day. You can save the world.' Greatness emerges out of those who love and believe in you. In Director Patty Jenkins and Screenwriter Allan Heinberg's 'Wonder Woman' hero emerges as bravery for those you love and believe in. For Jenkins and Heinberg, love creates Hero. Gal Gadot is a star. She is stunningly beautiful. She amazes with her physical gifts and martial arts skills in battle. She eloquently captures the innocence of the child, who believes in her heart that good will always conquer evil, although the world can be gray—neither light or dark. The hero is in Gadot's gaze, her words, and her calm stillness. As Diana, she inspires us to use our powers for good. 'Wonder Woman' too is inspired. A great movie. 'Wonder Woman' is the origins story of Diana, who becomes the superhero of the comic book, reset in World War I. The movie bogs down some in the middle as the narrative shifts focus to the War with Germany. The deadly gas weapon of mass destruction created by disfigured Dr. Maru, played by mysterious Elena Anaya, is coveted by General Ludendorff, malevolently played by Danny Huston. Yet, the hero story truly mesmerizes. Jenkins brilliantly creates homage to Greek Mythology as Amazon Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen) narrates the fable. God Zeus created Mankind on earth. Zeus loved Man as his own children. Outraged with jealousy his son Ares, God of War, gave Man fear, anger, and war. To save Man, Zeus created the Amazon women warriors. The Amazon live and train on the island of Themyscira, shrouded from the rest of civilization and Ares himself. Matthew Jensen's cinematography captures the life and light of idyllic Themyscira. The land possesses the beauty and strength of the women, who reside there. Hippolyta and her sister Antiope (Wright) battle over young Diana's destiny. Diana's benevolent Mother Hippolyta wishes to spare her daughter of the warrior's sacrifice, her own past. Aunt Antiope knows Diana is the chosen one, and secretly trains her niece. Hippolyta refuses to reveal to Diana her secret destiny, instead having Antiope train Diana as the Amazon's fiercest warrior. The grown Diana (Gadot) becomes the valiant idealist and protector, fulfilling that part of her destiny. Also the bracelets she wears in battle reveal invincible power. The War shapes Diana's destiny. British Captain Steve Trevor, played by charismatic Chris Pine, crashes his plane in the waters off Themyscira. He has the plans for the deadly German nerve gas. Diana saves his life. However, the Germans pursue Steve as well. The Amazons along with Steve defeat the German soldiers, but with tragic loss. Realizing the world is in peril with 'the war to end all wars', Diana disobeys her Mother's wishes, and sails with Steve back to London. Diana believes that to save Mankind she must slay Ares, God of War. Steve is sympathetic to idealist Diana; he only wants the War to end. Knowing Diana's destiny, her Mother lets her go. Diana takes along with her on the journey, the Amazon shield, and the sacred 'God Killer' sword to defeat Ares. Gadot commands 'Wonder Woman' and is the bright new star. She is amazing in all the screen battles. Her brave idealism and soul truly inspires. She tells British leader Sir Patrick, played by Danny Thewlis, 'You should be ashamed!'—that his generals don't fight with their men on the battlefield. The hero arises from those who love her. Nielsen, Wright, and Pine are amazing. Nielsen is touching as Hippolyta the stoic Mother, who loves Diana with all her heart. Wright is ruthless compassion as the warrior, who sees the greatness within her. Pine is surprisingly poignant as the man, who loves Diana, giving her purpose. With Jenkins and Gadot, hero is about love. Hero always is. Perhaps, 'Wonder Woman' can inspire other movie heroes to declare the same. Now that would be the grand legacy of 'Wonder Woman'.",10,13,30,4 June 2017
Marriage Story," Life in 'Marriage Story'
","Not so ironically, Writer and Director Noah Baumbach's 'Marriage Story' is about divorce. Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver play Nicole and Charlie Barber. They have a cute 8 year-old son Henry, played by resilient Azhy Robertson, who struggles with a learning disability.Charlie is the intense copious note taking Director of avant-garde theater in New York. Nicole is the former teen sex comedy movie star, who forsakes Hollywood stardom to act in her husband Charlie's theatrical stage productions.At the impasse in their marriage, Nicole accepts a TV series role in Los Angeles. She brings son Henry with her to Los Angeles, which is also home. Nicole lives with her Mom Sandra, played by whimsically wise Julie Hagerty, at her parents' home. Mom was the former Hollywood actress. Apparently, her late husband, Nicole's Father, was gay. Hence, that marriage also ended in divorce.On the other hand, Charlie grew up in the Midwest, raised by abusive alcoholic parents. So there's that. Although, Charlie occurs as rather anal retentive, controlling, he's a good kind man. Sandra loves him like a son. He's the good father. Perhaps, not the good husband. Apparently, he had an affair with his stage manager. Rather, Charlie might not be the good husband to Nicole.While in Los Angeles, Nicole hooks up with prominent divorce attorney Nora Fanshaw, played with charming ferocity by Laura Dern. Nora reassures Nicole, 'What you're doing is an act of hope.' She seems to have genuine compassion for Nicole's suffering.Yet, clearly Nora has her own cause: 'The idea of a good father was only invented 30 years ago...' Apparently, Nora has been deeply hurt from her own past marriage. So it's really not about Nicole. It's all about Nora. Just saying.As the movie opens, Charlie and Nicole work with their marriage Mediator. They're getting divorced. Each holds a letter that they wrote about what they love about the other. Director Noah brilliantly opens in flashbacks of Nicole and Charlie's life together, with Scarlett and Adam in narration. Clearly, Nicole and Adam love each other, are good parents, but perhaps, are no longer in love with each other.In the heart wrenching arc of 'Marriage Story', Nicole tells Charlie that she no longer loves him, that she hates him, what he stands for. Angry Charlie screams, 'I want you dead!' You see the sadness in Nicole's eyes. You witness the suffering in Charlie's eyes. I cried. Charlie literally drops to his knees.Yes, Charlie crossed the line. Yes, he was enraged. Yet, he occurred more wounded than angry. He was terrified that he lost the love of his life. That he lost Nicole. That's the profound humanity and brave vulnerability of Noah's 'Marriage Story'. No, Nicole and Charlie are not bad, people, who deserved what happened. Rather, life happened. Sometimes, life doesn't turn out the way we hoped, even with our best intentions. In this touching humanity Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver are sublime.Early on, when talking with her attorney Nora, Scarlett's Nicole said that she 'got small' with Charlie, that somehow her life got marginalized. Scarlett is so authentic, so courageous in her words and in her silence. Yes, she loves Charlie, but that hurts too much to continue to do so. Scarlett is awesome.Adam is simply amazing. He makes bold, compelling choices playing Charlie. Whether he flippantly comments on Nicole's haircut or when he struggles with the child car seat in his rental. Yeah, he's imperfect, and he tries so hard to do his best, to be right. Adam is profoundly vulnerable in Charlie's distinct humanity.In a scene with son Henry, Adam's Charlie remembers what made him fall madly and deeply in love with Scarlett's Nicole. There is beauty in imperfection, in their failed marriage. Life goes on. Yet, love is still the possibility. That's the power and poignancy of 'Marriage Story'. It's my very favorite movie of the year. Just saying.",10,9,15,26 December 2019
Step Up," A Real Step Up
","'Step Up' is derivative, predictable, and formulaic. That being said, Director Anne Fletcher's hybrid classical hip-hop dance romance is completely arresting and thoroughly enjoyable. I was surprised how engaging the movie is. Within the first 20 minutes, you can predict the outcome. And ultimately, it does not matternot in the least. What 'Step Up' has going for it is a breakthrough star performance by Channing Tatum. Tatum plays delinquent high school student Tyler Gage, who happens to be a gifted street dancer. Tyler rolls with Mac Carter (Damaine Radcliff) and his little brother Skinny (De'Shawn Washington). After Tyler is caught vandalizing the Maryland School of the Arts, he must serve his community work sentence at the school. Tyler catches the eye of star ballerina Nora Clark (Jenna Dewan). She spies Tyler's dance display outside the school. Nora is in a lurch. She is preparing her senior dance piece, but her dance partner is injured. Dance company reps attend the Senior Show. Nora promises her Mom (Deirdre Lovejoy) that if she does not land with a dance company she will apply to Cornell University. For Nora dance is her lifewhat she lives for. Eventually, Nora strikes a deal with School Director Gordon (Rachel Griffiths) and Tyler. Gordon reluctantly agrees.Tatum and Dewan have amazing chemistry as Tyler and Nora. Of course Nora has a self absorbed jerk boyfriend Brett (Josh Henderson), who is on the verge of signing a record deal with the collaboration of brilliant classical/ hip-hop composer Miles (recording star Mario). For the first time Tyler is able to see the greatness in himself. But like Mac reminds him, 'You quit everything you start.' So it is truly time for Tyler to be responsible for his life and risk being extraordinary. The '90210' and 'Fame' trite melodrama aside, 'Step Up' is inspiring and you cheer for Tyler and Nora. Even with the corn ball predictable story, 'Step Up' is really about taking responsibility for one's own greatnesswhich is everyone's birth right.'Step Up' has spectacular dancing be it ballet, hip-hop or hybrid. Jenna Dewan is a classically trained dancer. Channing Tatum is an awesome street dancer on screen. I checked on-line that Tatum is not a trained dancerhe a gifted athlete and martial artist. Tatum possesses a star quality and natural charisma. Tall and handsome he has great screen presence. Tatum plays basically a lug, but he is so charming and has great range. Whether he is playfully trading dance moves with his sister Camille (so cute Alyson Stoner) or fighting with a gang banger in a club he always comes across real. There is a truth about Tatum's performance. Though somewhat overshadowed, Jenna Dewan is winning and beguiling as Nora. Dewan captures Nora's passion and heart. She and Tatum have magical chemistry. That leverages against all the predictability inherent in 'Step Up'.Anne Fletcher as both director and choreographer is amazing. The final dance number is killer. However, I found more compelling the training and creative sequences with Tyler and Nora. Dance is a great discipline and an art. Training and talent get you in the door. Art is all about the feel, passion, and creation. 'Step Up' possesses these qualities and there is such joy in this movie. The music is equally stunning and captivating with its blend of urban beats and classical orchestration.The supporting cast is solid. Rachel Griffiths brings the right compassion and gravity as Director Gordon. Mario is natural and strong as composer Miles. Damaine Radcliff gives a street edge and authenticity to Mac. Lucy Avila is charming as Nora's friend Lucy.'Step Up' is great fun at the movies. Channing Tatum is a going to be a big star. 'Step Up' is a real step up.",8,2,6,30 August 2006
Shrek," Prince Charming... Ogre
","'Shrek' is the best movie of the year so far. Ted Elliot's screenplay message of not judging people (or ogres) by what they appear is 'in your face', funny, and truly touching. Not like this has any relevance to any of us living in a city like... LA. Elliot's words in concert with the direction and care of Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson make Shrek a special movie. Shrek, Princess Fiona, and Donkey are genuine characters that you care about. Mike Myer's Scottish Shrek voices the Ogre as one who is smart, brave, and lonely. Shrek knows what the game is, and how he fits in the grand scheme. There is a particularly moving scene while he and Donkey are looking at the stars, and Shrek voices the burden that he bears when it comes to people. Eddie Murphy as Donkey is fabulous as Shrek's sidekick and confidant. Murphy gets it right for the combination of smart-ass and compassion. Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona is perfect as the princess who has waited all her life to be rescued by her Prince Charming, only to saved by Shrek. And she also hides a secret. The end is a surprise and very cool one. Like the movie and it's story, what matters is a good heart and beautiful soul. Perhaps this is corny, and someone needs to remind us of that. Who better than 'Shrek'?",10,1,2,5 June 2001
X-Men: First Class," Between rage and serenity...
","Passionate James McAvoy as Charles Xavier implores his dear friend Erik Lehnsherr (sullenly charismatic Michael Fassbender) to let go and harness his innate power, 'True focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity.' 'X-Men: First Class' is about rediscovering one's power and choosing one's life path. In 'First Class' the difference between the hero and the villain may be choice. Director and Writer Matthew Vaughn's 'X-Men: First Class' has unexpected pathos. Set in 1962 'X-Men: First Class' compellingly tells the origins of the X-Men mythology. This is surprising given the numerous writers involved: Ashely Edward Miller, Zack Stentz, Jane Goldman, Sheldon Turner, and Bryan Singer (writer and director of the first two X-Men movies). Singer's signature narrative strands resonate here. Charles rescues Erik, who almost forfeits his life all for vengeance, reminding him, 'You are not alone!' For Singer, 'X-Men' has always been his allegory of courage in the face of prejudice and fear. In 'X-Men' Mutants, 'Children of the Atom', are born with special powers. Consequently, neither Human, Mutants are feared and forced to conceal, who they are. Like all discriminated, Mutants have lost the freedom to be. Although with some whimsical patches, 'X-Men: First Class' is amazingly somber. Its gravitas sources the period, 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Vaughn authentically recreates 1962. 'X-Men: First Class' has a retro James Bond look and feel. The art deco lines are elegantly clean. The wardrobe has slender lines and muted tones. Unlike other X-Men movies, this one is sexy. Vaughn has January Jones and Rose Byrne in cool 60's lingerie, in context of course. He even inserts the benign homage to 'Basic Instincts' with stunning Jones. 'First Class' is visually stunning. At the spectacular story arc Erik (Fassbender), harnessing his power, lifts a submerged submarine into the sky.On the downside 'X-Men: First Class' has at least two too many mutants and subplots. They are distracting. The power of 'First Class' lies in the relationship and transformation of Charles and Erik. McAvoy and Fassbender embody a formidable force. We are invested in their chosen fate. James McAvoy at first occurs as Harry Potter playing Xavier. He is deceptive in his compassion and strength. Unintentionally, he is the critical foil of the dominant dark presence of Erik. Through McAvoy's undying belief in the vestiges of nobility in Erik, we witness the tragic fall. Charles pleads with Erik, 'Killing will not bring you peace.' Erik reminds, 'Peace was never an option.' Fassbender is powerful. He is going to be a big star. As Erik, he compassionately leverages his pain and rage. Fassbender brilliantly hints at Erik's innate nobility and the cost of his forfeited humanity. Ultimately, Erik's fall from grace occurs when he succumbs to vengeance. To that end, Kevin Bacon is amazing as Sebastian Shaw, the man who created and cursed Erik. Bacon is awesome and convincing in his malevolent presence.'X-Men: First Class' recreates the opening of 'X-Men'. It is Poland 1944, young Erik is separated from his family as they are taken to the Nazi gas chambers. Immersed in fear and rage, Erik discovers his Mutant power over metal as he effortlessly twists the steel fence. Nazi scientist Shaw (Bacon) recognizes Erik's gift. In unspeakably ruthless act, Shaw coerces Erik to summon his power. Erik's life becomes ruled by vengeance. Back in wealthy English estate, we learn that young Charles is a telepath of uncharted ability. Not only can he read minds, he can also manipulate them. He befriends a fellow Mutant in Raven, a blue skinned shape shifter. Charles takes her in as his sister. Beautiful Jennifer Lawrence plays Raven as the young woman she becomes.Charles and Erik's lives follow apparently divergent paths. Now 18 years later, Erik searches for Shaw in Argentina. Charles is at Oxford University with Raven. He is finishing his doctorate on human mutation. However one move ahead, Shaw is in Las Vegas generating his master plan to ignite World War III. CIA operative Moira MacTaggert (spunky Rose Byrne) witnesses Shaw in surveillance of Hell Fire Club. Byrne provides great spirit as Moira. Requiring expertise on Mutants, Moira seeks out Charles. Charles knowingly aligns forces with the CIA to bring Shaw to justice. This leads to the inevitable collision with Erik's path of vengeance. Vaughn masterfully orchestrates the tragic hero story and world brinkmanship.There are so many Mutants on both sides of the fight. January Jones makes a seductive turn as Emma Frost, a telepath who can transform to diamond. Nicholas Hoult is strong as the angst ridden and innocent scientist Hank McCoy. The other X-Men classmates are cool, but get lost in the noise. Jennifer Lawrence brilliantly fleshes out Raven, who comes to terms with her own identity and leverages the plot tipping point.'X-Men: First Class' lives and dies in the brotherhood of Charles and Erik in the battle of good and evil. Through the performances of McAvoy and Fassbender, the lines are poignantly blurred. Triumph is solemn, and the fall from grace is tragic. 'X-Men: First Class' may be the best X-Men movie. And it is just a great movie.",10,4,8,5 June 2011
The Wolverine," Jackman is The Wolverine
","Hugh Jackman is awesome in 'The Wolverine'. As hero Logan he commands the screen. He is absolutely shredded, and fights with fierce samurai skills. Jackman authentically explores Logan's despair in his immortal fate with the Director James Mangold's envisioning of Wolverine's search for purpose. Jackman is deftly droll as Logan, hiding a well of emotion. 'The Wolverine' ebbs on the verge of great with resonant values of mortality, purpose, and honor.The movie opens with an amazing news reel-like sequence of Nagasaki in World War II. Logan selflessly saves his captor Japanese officer Yashida (young Ken Yamanouchi) from the atomic bomb explosion. In present day Logan (Jackman) returns to the site with Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (stunning and beautiful Tao Okamoto). She recalls her grandfather's stories. She tells Logan, 'Everything finds peace eventually.' This gets lost in the last 20 minutes of the movie when it implodes into standard action mayhem.The screenplay by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank is based on classic storyline by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller as Logan travels back to Japan. Though familiar, but not having read it, some of the appealing back story is displaced. 'The Wolverine' misses the profound opportunity to show Logan become samurai. Battling vicious Yakuza at the Shinto ceremony is elegantly spectacular. The martial arts are exquisite. Hiroyuki Sanada (of 'The Last Samurai') is world class. As Shingen his katana duel with the Wolverine is signature precision. Rila Fukushima as Logan's 'protector' Yukio is so cool with thrusting staff and kicks.Jackman as Logan fights in deadly martial arts style. It is weird that Logan's samurai skills are not really explained, though he is rogue samurai—Ronin without master or purpose. He comments on Shingen's kendo mastery display, 'He's good.' A clue? Too bad samurai themes of mortality and fatalism are not more fleshed out. Jackman and Mangold hint with Logan's seeming restraint. Wolverine's 'beserker' rage has element of focus. I was expecting 'The Last Samurai' meets the Wolverine, but unfortunately not. The sword fight on top of the Bullet Train is breathtaking, and the Ninja archers in the snowy village are high drama. Given the tantalizing set up, we really don't get eloquent resolution of Mariko's deserved peace or the discovery of one's purpose in mortality .To that end we find Logan having nightmares about his beloved Jean Grey. Famke Jassen is beautiful and strangely haunting. Logan poignantly wishes for death. However, his regenerative powers make him virtually immortal. Since Jean's death, he lives alone in the icy woods of Alaska. About to exact revenge on reckless grizzly bear hunters, Logan is saved from himself by J-pop warrior Yukio (strong and spirited Rila Fukushima). She has been looking for him for over a year. Yashida is dying of cancer and would like to see Logan. Yashida (solid Harahiko Yamanouchi) is now the richest man in the World. He offers to repay Logan with is mortality—'Eternity can be a curse.' Logan says. 'You don't want what I got.' Logan becomes immersed in the Family drama. Shingen (Sanada) and his daughter Mariko clash over who will be heir to the Yashida Empire. Mariko is in a beneficial, but loveless engagement to Noburo (good snakelike Brian Tee). Mariko has a protector in Harada (brave Will Yun Lee), former lover. The mysterious Viper (enigmatic and evil Svetlana Khodchenkova) may have secretly weakened Logan.Twists ensue and Logan becomes Mariko's savior and defender. I actually think their love story is inspired. Jackman and Okamoto have a touching chemistry. Again like much of narrative, we miss a gratifying payoff. 'The Wolverine' is an awesome action movie, and Mangold generates beauty with Japanese locals and distinct culture. Through all this Hugh Jackman commands 'The Wolverine' and makes it worth watching. Jackman is powerful. He genuinely enrolls us in Logan's vulnerability tempered with his great courage. He is amazing. He makes us pull for the poetic samurai conclusion. 'The Wolverine' and Hugh Jackman are amazing.",10,32,64,28 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The Hero Rises
","Director Christopher Nolan's epic 'The Dark Knight Rises' opens with a breathtaking aerial display as skydivers propel into the vertical aircraft fuselage. No CGI here. You can also feel the impact as Christian Bale's Batman trades vicious martial arts blows with the muscled monstrosity Bane, terrifying muzzled Tom Hardy. However, the Dark Knight truly rises in the quiet humanity of the authentic relationship of Bruce Wayne (Bale) and his guardian Alfred, played by Michael Caine. Intentionally becoming the reclusive martyr for the good of Gotham City, lonely broken Bruce confesses to Alfred, 'There is nothing for me out there.' Caine is mesmerizing as he tells the story of when Bruce was missing for 7 years that he would travel to Florence every year hoping to glimpse Bruce at peace in his life. Everyone deserves to find that modicum of peace in life, including the hero. What is the karma of the hero? This pursuit resonates in Christopher Nolan's cinematic parable. 'The Dark Knight Rises' completes this amazing trilogy, and is the distinct end of the hero's journey for Bruce Wayne. Nolan said, 'Every great story deserves a great ending.' Chris Nolan has done so on a massive scale, that is so eloquent and personal in catharsis. He leverages the classics quoting Dickens, 'It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better resting place that I go to, than I have ever known.' Nolan brilliantly comes full circle in the hero mythology. I have read several critic reviews praising 'The Dark Knight Rises' that understates Christian Bale. To be clear: Christian Bale is powerful. The amazing actor makes 'The Dark Knight Rises' satisfying and complete. In the story by Nolan, Jonathan Nolan, and David S. Goyer, 8 years has passed since 'The Dark Knight'. Batman framed himself for District Attorney Dent's murder, making himself a vigilante fugitive. Commissioner Gordon, played with tortured gravitas by Gary Oldman, reluctantly furthers the conspiracy for the greater good. Bale's Bruce is a hollowed man, nearly crippled from his injuries and suffering a broken heart—the love of his life murdered. In the Batman mythology, Bruce created Batman as a symbol to inspire others, to be incorruptible and immortal. The paradox was that Batman also was born out of Bruce's story of his powerlessness as a child to prevent his parents' brutal murder. Bale captures Bruce's anger and emptiness beneath the charming visage. Here Nolan creates Bruce's younger reflection in charismatic and intense Joseph Gordon-Levitt as police officer John Blake. This is the unfamiliar Bruce Wayne, whose soul seems more ravaged than his body. Blake believes in heroes; he believes in Batman. Bale brilliantly hints at the fire within Bruce, waiting for a cause. He tragically inhabits a man who fears life, more than death. Strong and compassionate Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle pleads with Batman, 'You've given them everything!' Bruce says, 'Not everything. Not yet...' Every great hero story is defined by a great villain. That is Bane. Tom Hardy is awesome as the nearly indestructible Bane. Hardy put on 30 pounds of muscle to play the ferocious Bane. He is sheer force. Bane is the enigmatic bald hulk with a mask that treats the unbearable pain of an unspeakable injury. The mask distorts his voice, sounding like Darth Vader. At times it is incoherent; however Hardy's commanding intentions are distinct. Bane is the paid terrorist, who was excommunicated from the League of Shadows, the Ninja Clan that also trained Bruce. Their mentor was Ra's Al Ghul (charismatic Liam Neeson). Nolan strokes Bane as more anarchist than mercenary. The merciless Bane is strangely noble. Perhaps, the difference between the hero and the villain lies in the choices he made?Nolan's exposition is as ambitious as the action and visuals. He viscerally paints the post 911 world on the tipping point of economic collapse, fear, and class warfare. He also incorporates storyline with Wayne Industries' shelved fusion project for clean sustainable energy source that gets turned sideways. Enter Miranda Tate (beautiful and mysterious Marion Cotillard), Wayne Board member, who has a strong attraction for the reclusive Wayne. Anne Hathaway as sleek cat burglar Selina Kyle steals Bruce's valued keepsake and something invaluable tied to the shadowy conspiracy that ultimately leads to Bane. Intrigued Bruce enrolls CEO Lucius Fox (solid Morgan Freeman) to get him back into the game. Their bond has morphed into an unspoken caring. Hathaway is stunning. Though she is never called Cat Woman in the movie, she looks amazing in the skin tight leather, and kicks martial arts butt. The weird part, her mastery in kickboxing and Aikido is never explained. Beneath the bravado, Hathaway displays a tender soul. The hero always sees and believes the best in people. Bale and Hathaway have that quality, and that belies Nolan's poignant theme of redemption. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is the best movie of the year. Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale are awesome. The epic journey of the hero comes to an end, and we are inspired. All is complete.",10,9,20,22 July 2012
Black Panther," Becoming Greater
","Although early in 2018, Writer and Director Ryan Coogler's 'Black Panther' is one of the year's best. At least it shall be one of my favorites. 'Black Panther' transcends the superhero movie genera that thrills and touches our souls. 'Black Panther' is beautiful to behold with the majestic African landscape and seamlessly generated images of the futuristic culture of Wakanda literally hidden from the rest of the world. The screen astounds in tragic physical battles or the shiny Lexus's racing through the night streets in Korea. Ryan along with co-writer Joe Robert Cole create inspired conversations of the sacrifices of becoming greater, forgiveness of betrayal, forsaking utopian isolationism for the greater good. 'Black Panther' is the culture phenomenon. 'Black Panther' tells the timeless tale of the Hero and the defining other. Chadwick Boseman is magnificent as T'Challa, who becomes the legendary Black Panther. T'Challa succeeds his murdered Father T'Chaka, played by John Kani, as King of Wakanda. Strikingly handsome Chadwick embodies grace and elegant swag. He distinguishes the hero in his action, his words, and in the power of his tears. Michael B. Jordan plays mercenary ex-CIA operative Eric Killmonger, who defines T'Challa, the Black Panther. Michael is powerful as the suffering villain Eric. In Ryan's narrative and Michael's soulful being, we can't dismiss Eric as mere villain. He's human, too. Like T'Challa, Eric is both lightness and darkness. We all are. Eric's tremendous rage sources from his unforgiving past. T'Challa realizes Eric horrific betrayal. In T'Challa's 'vision quest', he confronts his Father. He cries, 'We were wrong!' T'Challa perhaps is the greater man. His Father's words, 'And it's hard for a good man to be king.'- become his paradox. Eric's suffering robbed him of compassion. Though his noble purpose is equality for all. Even the villain is not all darkness. 'Black Panther' is eloquent resolution of the ideologies of T'Challa and Eric, each valuing courage and dignity in their own ways. Chadwick and Michael's conflict profoundly move us. T'Challa's tears touched my soul. In the 'Black Panther' mythology, Wakanda emerged when a meteor of made of Vibranium, the hardest metal known, crashes in Africa. Vibranium allowed the people of Wakanda to develop breakthrough technology, becoming the most advanced culture on Earth. Unbeknownst to everyone else. Wakanda is composed of five united tribes lead by the mythical Black Panther. The Black Panther is from the lineage of Kings, who with the serum of the indigenous plant possess great strength, speed, and agility. T'Challa is the next Black Panther. His mother is nurturing Ramonda, played by strong Angela Bassett, who believes he shall be the great King. His sister is genius scientist Shuri, whimsically brilliant Letita Wright. Letita is the scene stealing star. Shuri is like T'Challa's 'Q' creating the kinetic energy suit he wears among other weaponry. His ex-lover Nakia, played by strong beautiful Lupita Nyongo, is the spy gathering intelligence on the outside world. Amazing Danai Guria plays General Okoye, the powerful warrior guarding the Royal Family. Arms dealer Ulysses Klaue, played by ruthless Andy Serkis, steals Vibranium threatening the revelation of Wakanda and its secrets. Eric is Klaue's mission leader. Klaue seemingly reveals the singluar narrative frailty. He is without nuance almost caricature. He serves as the plot device tying in charismatic Eric. 'Black Panther' mesmerizes in stunning vibrant visual displays and the inspired battles of T'Challa and Eric. Ryan's words and story resonate. Nakia tells T'Challa, 'Only you can decide what kind of king you want to be.' What kind of person will you be? Who will you become? That inspired to make me to look within as well.That's what is so special about 'Black Panther'. 'Black Panther' dares you to choose the greater than path, becoming greater than you know yourself to be. To create and live in that greater space. And the world will be greater for it.",10,6,17,21 February 2018
Iron Man," Iron Man Rocks
","'Iron Man' is great. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing. I was completely surprised by Director Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man'. 'Iron Man' never struck me as the most compelling superhero, after all his powers derived from the high tech metal suit. Despite the army of screenwritersMark Fergus, Hawk Ostby, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, 'Iron Man' evokes spectacular visual excitement and a great character arc. Downey at the beginning is so out there as hysterically arrogant billionaire CEO Tony Stark, who asks at a demonstration of his latest Stark Industries weapon, 'Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both?' In dramatic transformation as hero, Downey later poignantly confesses to Pepper Potts (beautiful Gwenyth Paltrow), 'I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.' Robert Downey Jr. has always been his generation's most talented actor. It is gratifying to see him back, recovered, and at the peak of his powers.Yes, 'Iron Man' is perhaps the coolest cutting edge technology display. However, it is Downey's masterfully balance of comedic and dramatic power that amazes. He is also supported by great actorsOscar winners and nominees. Terrance Howard plays Col. Jim Rhodes, who is Tony Stark's Government liaison, is smart and quietly solid. Gwenyth Paltrow plays to her strength in her light comedic romantic role. She is brilliant and charmingly goofy as Stark's loyal assistant Pepper Potts. Jeff Bridges is the charismatic dark force of Obadiah Stane, Stark's partner at Stark Industries, whose true intentions are murky. All this and watching Iron Man jet super sonic in the heavens makes this one the year's best and coolest movies.Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is boy genius from M.I.T., who is now CEO of his late father's Stark Industries. Stark Industries is the world's largest Defense Contractor, and Stark himself is anointed the 'Merchant of Death'. His father's partner Obadiah Stane (Bridges) remains Tony's business partner and confidant. In a weapons demonstration trip gone amok in Afghanistan, Stark is mortally wounded, and held hostage by 'freedom fighters'. Along with fellow prisoner Yinsen (strong and endearing Shaun Toub), Stark rigs an ingenious power generator for his damaged heart that keeps him alive. At the same time, he creates the prototype 'Iron Man' to affect his escape. This forever alters and transforms Stark, who now honors the words of Yinsen, 'Don't waste your life.' Returning back home Stark announces to the world, while eating a cheeseburger, that Stark Industries will no longer manufacture weapons of mass destruction, much to the chagrin of Obadiah. Stark secretly develops the 'Iron Man' suit for himself at his ostentatiously high tech Malibu estate. Stark comically and intensely works on the crimson and gold 'Iron Man' amidst his Audi sports cars and cool cyber toys. Downey looks great bulked up, and artistically executes physical comedy genius. Here Paltrow brings her best. Her Pepper feigns disinterest in Stark, but her unquestioned loyalty hints at her true feelings. Downey as Stark also plays brilliant and aloof, who finally gets a clue about making a difference in life and Pepper. They are so amazing and funny together. Bridges as Obadiah emerges as the visceral threat. Of course 'Iron Man' veers into darker conspiracy, and the battle of good against great evil. Director Favreau orchestrates the CGI battle with pathos and style. 'Iron Man' at its best is visually breathtaking.'Iron Man' is one the year's best movies and Robert Downey Jr. returns with a spectacularly multidimensional and powerful performance. What Downey does is not conventionally acknowledged with awards, though it really warrants it. The special effects particularly the Iron Man rendering is so cool. 'Iron Man' has a strong story and great actors. See 'Iron Man'.",10,2,5,10 May 2008
Mother!," What the...
","'Mother!' is totally bizarre, and mind bending disturbing. No, clearly these are not props. Writer and Director Darren Aronofsky is angry and surreal in his apparent elegy of the artist's lost muse. After watching this 'What the' vanity project, I have to wonder whether it extends far beyond mere indulgence. This is not at all a great movie. Really. At times when I viewed the movie as an observer instead of being an audience, the story is laughably ridiculous, taking itself way too seriously. Then again that in itself is somewhat entertaining.Literally, none of Aronofsky's characters have names. I'll use the actor's names when possible. Jennifer Lawrence plays the much younger wife of bestselling author Javier Bardem. Jenn is the melancholy wife, who valiantly restores their country home. Apparently, this was Javier's childhood home that was destroyed in a fire. Jenn wants a baby. However, Javier suffers writer's block, and has lost his muse. The two stopped having sex. 'Mother!' then spirals into the abyss. Ed Harris and his wife, in the movie, Michelle Pfieffer become uninvited house guests. Their prodigal sons return played by Brian Gleeson and Dowhnall Glesson, as Cain and Abel characters in Aronofsky's passion play. 'Mother!' defies description, being so hard to figure out what is going on. It is strangely amusing in the over the top repulsive imagery and muddled logic. In a weird way, I kind of enjoyed 'Mother!' given the ending. Seemingly, the angst of the lost artist's muse is more than personal, at least for Aronofsky. 'Mother!' will not be everyone's 'cup of tea'. It is neither mine, as well.",7,3,8,17 September 2017
Creed II," What We Love...
","In 'Creed II' elder noble Sylvester Stallone reprises as legendary Rocky Balboa. Rocky asks Adonis 'Donnie' Creed, played by amazing Michael B. Jordan, 'What are you fighting for?' World Heavyweight Champion Donne was physically massacred in a previous fight with 6' 5', 245 pound 'beast' Viktor Drago, played by real-life German boxer Florian Munteanu, son of Ivan Drago, surprising Dolph Lundgren.Recall from 'Rocky IV' Ivan killed Adonis's Father Apollo Creed in an exhibition boxing match that Rocky declined. Rocky could have saved his best friend Apollo by stopping the fight, but he didn't. That haunted Rocky for the last 33 years. In 'Rocky IV' Rocky traveled to Moscow to fight Ivan to avenge Apollo's death. He knocks out Ivan in the final round. Steroid juiced Ivan was supposed to be the 'perfect' fighter. Perhaps, not. This all happened before Adonis was even born. In the past.So what is Donne fighting for? Director Steven Caple Jr. creates Donnie's journey in 'Creed II' with less poignancy and clarity than the original 'Creed'. Steven replaced Ryan Coogler as director with somewhat lesser human transparency. Yet, 'Creed II' is good enough. 'Creed II' is the compelling narrative of the 'Sins of the Fathers'. In a touching moment in Rocky's restaurant 'Adrian's' Ivan confronts Rocky for the first time since they fought.Granite-like Dolph as Ivan commands subtle gravitas. He says to Rocky, 'Because of you, I lost everything.' When Ivan lost to Rocky he plummeted from virtual paragon to social outcast in Ukraine. His wife left both him and his son Viktor. All Viktor knows is fighting. He was 'raised in hate' by Ivan. We witness their 'tough love' relationship as the movie opens as Ivan chastises Viktor to run faster while driving in his van. They both have something to prove.That volatile Father-Son dynamic is the realistic anchor of Sylvester Stallone and Juel Taylor's screenplay. Sly and Juel might have intended for more Shakespearean, but the narrative is too broad and unfocused. In 'Creed' I was in tears as Donnie tells Rocky not to stop his fight. He still had something to prove: 'That I'm not a mistake.' In 'Creed II' Rocky has become the Father, Donnie needed. However, Rocky is incomplete in his own relationship with his son Robert, played by Milo Ventimiglia.Donnie must reconcile his late father Apollo's legacy, a man he never knew. Totally chiseled Michael B. inspires authentic suffering and vulnerability as Donnie seeks to discover himself. The boxing scenes in 'Creed II' are visually astounding. Michael gained 20 pounds of muscle and along with Florian trained intensely for months.Where the fights in 'Creed' had an authentic realism, 'Creed II' is more theatrical in the shear speed and power displayed on screen. The traded blows make you wince. That visceral emotion comes across in the first fight. Donnie is the valiant champion, who is truly afraid. Viktor is bigger, faster, and stronger. How can he win?It's in the life outside the ring that redeems and transcends 'Creed II'. In the whimsical scene after Donnie wins the Heavyweight Championship, he asks his 'Unc' for advice in proposing to Bianca, radiantly beautiful Tessa Thompson. Bianca is Donnie's longtime girlfriend, the gifted singer-composer gradually losing her hearing to a degenerative disease. Rocky tells Donnie to forget what's in your head, go with what's in your heart. When 'Creed II' shows its heart as Michael B cries watching the diagnostic monitor in the hospital, it reminds that humanity and family worth fighting for.Michael B eloquently defines the Hero in his courageous acts and in the power of his tears. He and Dolph discover the forgiveness in our sins of the past. Michael empowers 'Creed II': Life is about the passion of what we love, whether we win or lose. That's what is at stake in Donnie and Vilktor's climactic Championship fight.In the timeless tale of Fathers and Sons: The Son wants to know that his Father is proud of him. The Son wants to know his Father's love. In this 'Creed II' delivers a knockout. We all need to know that we're enough, that we all deserve to be loved.",8,19,32,25 November 2018
Bruce Almighty," In Jim, We Trust
","Tom Shadyac's 'Bruce Almighty' starring Jim Carrey is flat out funny. Jim Carrey is totally in his medium-- comedy. 'Bruce' has a surprisingly good story by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe, and Steve Oedekerk. Jim Carrey is awesome as Bruce Nolan: wannabe news anchorman and over all whiner. Bruce's life is not what it ought to be... Someone get him a tissue. Anyway, God (wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman) is listening to our whining hero and grants Bruce his powers, so God can take a vacation. The only catch is that Bruce cannot mess with free-will. Jennifer Aniston is absolutely charming, and funny as Bruce's suffering girlfriend. Where else can you see great visual gags, and still address the eternal question: How can you make someone love you, and not mess with free-will? Even God would like to know. Shadyac and Carrey have done their job. They make us laugh big time, make us think, and they never take themselves seriously. Now that is close to godliness.",8,0,1,16 June 2003
Monsters University," Monsters University Delivers
","Pixar's 'Monsters University' is hysterical and unexpectedly touching. Finally, saw it a couple weeks ago. MU is predictable, given that it is a prequel to Pixar's animated classic 'Monsters Inc.' Billy Crystal and John Goodman wonderfully return as the voices of Mike, basically a walking eyeball, and Sulley, the towering blue and purple hairy monster. I saw 'Monsters University' in 2D not 3D, and still the picture had amazing visual depth. First time Director Dan Scanlon creates a natural warmth and testiness among this ensemble mash-up. He along with writers Daniel Greson and Robert L. Baird upholds the lineage of all the great Pixar movies: they have amazing stories. Randy Newman's score is on point with whimsy and wacky sentimentality. Yes, the animation is robust and vibrant down to the detail of Sulley's shedding hair.'Monsters University' is almost as good as 'Monsters Inc.', though what it loses in originality is balanced by Mike and Sulley's transformed friendship. The polarized future buddies meet in the Scare Program at MU. Mike (Billy Crystal) is the text book scare nerd. Sulley (John Goodman) is the Big Monster on Campus knowing he can get by on the Sullivan name. The rivals meet their true nemesis and mentor in Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), the staid multi-legged insect-like creature. The almost indistinguishable Mirren has an omniscient presence that gravitates. She eloquently states the obvious to Mike, 'You are just not scary.' She knows that Sulley is skating on raw talent without character. Consequently, Mike and Sulley are forced into alliance with not so scary Oozma Kappa Fraternity, one of whose members is Squishy—very telling. They must overcome implausible odds and win the MU Scare Games, their last gasp at redemption.At the story arc during the Scare Games, in Rocky-like fashion Sulley tells Mike, 'You can't change who you are!' Rather you have to get who you are. Crystal and Goodman are brilliant as Mike and Sulley discover that their partnership is way greater than its individual parts. That may be the beauty of 'Monsters University'. Friendship, respect and love foster greatness in Monsters and people. Director Scanlon refreshingly and wryly reminds us of this in 'Monsters University'.",10,3,4,18 July 2013
Casino Royale," Old School Bond, New Life
","'You don't trust anyone So you learned your lesson.' Judi Dench as M says this to Daniel Craig's James Bond. This is a harsh and life altering lesson for newly licensed to kill Agent 007 in Director Martin Campbell's 'Casino Royale'. 'Casino Royale' distinguishes itself as the debut of Daniel Craig as James Bond, and a reinvention of the Bond franchise. On the second count, the paradox is that this new Bond is very old school. 'Casino Royale' was the first of Ian Flemming's Bond novels. This adaptation by screenwriters Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis provides a glimpse of the man before he would become suave Agent 007. This time around we actually get a feel for James Bond as a man, not just a caricature. Perhaps Paul Haggis's contribution is a compelling story of love and betrayal. In the first scene of 'Casino Royale' Bond attains his '00' status with his first two kills. One is a bloody brawl in the restroom. The other is a clean kill shot. Bond is a cold dispassionate killer. That's what he does. Back to the first count: Daniel Craig is awesome. Craig is perhaps the most physical Bond ever, including a young Sean Connery, and he nails the dangerous bad boy persona unlike any predecessor. Craig punctuates the action as Bond, given the opening kills and the breathtaking high altitude fight scene on the girders of a construction sight. All the fight scenes are devastating with a martial arts and street-fighting edge. Old school.Daniel Craig is the first blond Bond, younger, and shorter than previous Bonds (at just under 6 foot). That being said, he may be the best Bond yet. Arguably the 'best' Bond, Sean Connery, still played Bond with an air of self amusement, knowing that his character was never in any true danger. Craig provides a dangerous powerful presence. He is a rugged man, a great athlete with a ripped physique. Props to Craig, not since the young Connery has Bond looked good without a shirt. Craig plays Bond as a real guy. As the evolving super spy, he is rough, reckless, and sullen. Craig also instills in Bond vulnerability, and self awareness that he is a killer albeit for Her Majesty's Secret Service. So when he falls for the beautiful and beguiling Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), it is a combination of swallowed ego and surrender. Bond (Craig) tells Vesper (Green), 'I have no armor left.' This is not a less manly Bond, rather a more human Bond.'Casino Royale' has been updated from the original Flemming Cold War novel to the present day threat of global terrorist cells. International investment banker LeChiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) has financed terrorists around the world since 9/11, and has become very wealthy and powerful. Following a botched operation tracking down a terrorist in Madagascar, Bond is ordered on hiatus by M (Judi Dench). M knows her young charge will not give up the trail. Bond goes to the Bahamas, then eventually to Montenegro for a $150 million poker game with LeChiffre. The plan is for Bond to beat LeChiffre; thus, exposing him to his nefarious investors. Enter British Treasury official Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) with Bond's $10 million stake. At first Vesper is unimpressed with the newly anointed '00'. However, that eventually changes. There are perhaps two weaknesses that keep 'Casino Royale' from being a stunning movie. First, LeChiffre, who actually cries bloody tears, is not a great threatening villain. Granted Craig is a powerful force. However, Mikkelsen comes off as more an effeminate freak with a cruel sadistic edge as evidenced by the horrific torture scene near the end. 'Casino Royale' at 2 hours and 24 minutes, much like this comment, runs too long. There are a lot of great action scenes including an electrifying airport sequence, but too much time is spent on the poker game. One of the surprising elements that work is the deepened relationship between M and Bond. M is ruthless in coaching her young charge, acknowledging his destiny of greatness. Dench breaths a refreshing motherliness and compassion in M-- she knows that for Bond to become great he must discard part of his own humanity. Here Campbell, writers Purvis, Wade, and Haggis are compelling.The love story in the context of Bond's evolution is a surprising twist. Eva Green's bravado and lilt spirit make her striking as Vesper Lynd. The performances are solid. Judi Dench is great this time around providing added dimension to M, Director of MI6. Mads Mikkelsen does the best he can with the eccentric evil LeChiffre. Daniel Craig is powerful. His performance enlightens us of the character, and evolves the franchise. Craig's Bond fears no man, though he can forfeit his heart to a woman. A different kind of Bond? Perhaps. This is definitely a Bond worth following.",9,0,2,18 November 2006
Toy Story 3," So Long...
","'Toy Story 3' is one the best movies of the year. Pixar, John Lassiter, and company have done it again—crafted a visually captivating movie and a sentimental story with heart. I saw 'Toy Story 3' when it first came out over a month ago. I waited until now to write a comment—not really compelled to generate something quickly. Tom Hank's beloved cowboy toy Woody stares off to the distance and says, 'So long partner.' I got a lump in my throat. For me Woody is really saying, 'I will always love you, partner.' However, this catharsis of unconditional love and legacy does not seem to culminate from the chaos of the Daycare Center, the chases, and crises. Wonder if we could have arrived at the same space, otherwise. I recalled the eloquence of 'Toy Story 2' with Sarah McLachlan singing 'When Somebody Loved Me' over 10 years ago. I remember that fondly to this day, and being profoundly moved and inspired. I think 'Toy Story 3' is great, but falls short of 'Toy Story 2'. Props to Director Lee Unkrich and Writers John Lassiter and Andrew Stanton for completing the trilogy in satisfying style. The animation is amazing and breathtaking. I loved the return of all the great character toys including Ken (Michael Keaton) and Barbie (Jodie Benson). However, I was puzzled by some of the darker narrative elements. In the story, Andy (John Morris) prepares to leave for college. He must decide what to do with his old toys. Obviously, he can't take them all with him—aside from perhaps Woody (Hanks). In a mix up the bulk of the toys including Buzz Lightyear (hysterical Tim Allen) end up as donations to Sunnyside Daycare. On the surface this may be new life for the toys—they will be loved by new children all over again. The subtext is unexpectedly menacing. So it is Woody to the rescue.The seemingly jolly teddy bear Lotso (folksy charming Ned Beatty) is so off. We get the creepiness factor which grows exponentially as the story unfolds. Also his partner is the hideously scary Baby Doll missing an eye. This is kind of a weird throw back to old school Disney movies which routinely and bizarrely incorporated evil narrative elements into children's stories. Even Lassiter and Stanton's back story on Lotso doesn't generate any authentic compassion or sympathy.The chases are fun, and the story lines about Buzz speaking Spanish are distracting escapist genius. However, all that and the final visually stunning conflict are not required to connect the dots to the point of the story which resonates with everyone. The point seems that as much as Andy loved Woody, Buzz, and company, they loved him back, too. Life continues on, always changing and evolving, and so does love. Unkrich seamlessly threads this in the beginning as Andy's Mom (solid Laurie Metcalf) is really heartbroken that Andy is all grown up, and starting a new stage in life, as well as herself. She raised Andy to be a good man, and she will always love him. And still there is a sense of loss in this. Unkrich and Lassiter suggest that much the same can be said of Woody and Buzz. You need not fret over their legacy, as well. Andy says of Woody, 'He'll never give up on you ever. He'll be there for you, no matter what.' That is also what a loving parent does. 'Toy Story 3' is the state of art in animation. And like all great Pixar movies 'Toy Story 3' resonates with great heart and moves us. Whatever, narrative glitches and lively distractions occur in Act 2, Unkrich and Lassiter circle back and touchingly complete this life story. Life continues on-- we will always love those dear to us, and that too may be unrecognizable. That's just life.",10,1,1,21 August 2010
Signs," Signs by design
","M. Night Shyamalan's 'Signs' was totally unexpected, not with respect to the ending, but rather for it's funny and quirky style in the midst of a story structured for great apprehension and fear of the unknown. Ultimately Shyamalan has created a parable about the nature of faith, and that things happen by design. The fact the Shyamalan does all this in one movie is an amazing accomplishment. Mel Gibson is a Graham Hess, who is a farmer in town in Pennsylvania. He has two children, Morgan (Rory Culkin) and Bo (Abigail Breslin). We soon learn that Graham was an Episcopal priest, who left when his wife was killed in an accident. Also Graham's brother, Merrill, is also living on the farm helping him out with his kids. One of the Signs appears in Graham's corn fields. They are the kind we saw in the 1970's that were supposedly used my ancient astronauts (i.e. aliens) to navigate earth. Strange things are happening. Dogs are going crazy. Bo says that her glasses of water taste funny. Soon after spaceships appear all over the world-- all on TV. Do they come in peace? Mel Gibson gives one of his best performances. As Graham he is suffering, and not only has he lost his faith, but even has it that God has betrayed him. There is an awesome scene in the movie where Graham and Merrill are watching new reports of the spaceships. Graham says that there are two camps when it comes to 'signs': one group sees the wonder of it, because they believe in something by design, the other fears the end of the world, because they see that they are ultimate all alone. Both are generated. And Graham falls in the latter. Gibson's character is struggling, and he makes his plight so noble and human. This makes the movie worth watching. The interesting thing about 'Signs' is that along with the tension and apprehension created for the possible aliens, it is not really that necessary to the story. And this actually makes 'Signs' special, because it is really about Graham's life and his family. Shyamalan surprises us in the end in a paradoxical way, in terms of our expectations. It is satisfying and honors the integrity of the characters he made us care about, particularly Gibson's Graham. 'Signs' is a very good movie.",9,0,2,7 August 2002
Live Free or Die Hard," You're that Guy
","'Live Free or Die Hard' is perhaps among the greatest action movies ever made. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is nonstop action and the most fun you can have at the movies this summer. Director Len Wiseman (of 'Underworld' fame) quickly enrolls you, and it matters little how preposterous the action gets. Bruce Willis is awesome in his reprisal of New York Detective John McClane. Willis like his character is older, and plays him as such with a world weariness and power. Justin Long is amazing as the cyber hacker Matt Farrell, whom McClane is tasked to protect. McClane (Willis) is assigned to bring to the FBI hacker Matt Farrell (Long), who may shed light upon a world gone amok. The intangible key to the movie is Willis and Long's working partnership and chemistry. Even with one of the most convoluted story credits: Mark Bomback for screenplay and story; David Marconi for story; John Carlin's article 'A Farewell to Arms'; Roderick Thorp for the original characters; the story is engaging and in the realm of possibility-- really.As the movie opens, Farrell transfers his software code to the deadly and beautiful Mai (Maggie Q). Soon thereafter the Eastern Seaboard becomes engulfed in a catastrophic network meltdownpotentially encompassing the entire nation. Upon observing the chaos, Matt concludes to FBI director Bowman (Cliff Curtis) that this is a 'fire sale'. Apparently, in the hacker world this mythical 'fire sale' refers to network Armageddon. There are three stages of a 'fire sale': 1. transportation and communications shutdown; 2. financial system collapse; 3. termination of infrastructure such as power and water. Is this the work of 'virtual terrorists' creating a new world order or an elite group seeking unimaginable wealth? Matt is an unintentional pawn; thus, he and McClane must hunt down legendary DoD Consultant Thomas Gabriel (coolly evil Timothy Olyphant), who masterminds this apparent anarchist plot. The pursuit becomes personal when Gabriel holds McClane's daughter Lucy (strong and spirited Mary Elizabeth Winstead) hostage.Aside from the captivating car crashing into a helicopter or big rig dodging heat seeking missiles from an F-30 fighter jet, it is the human drama and conflict of 'Live Free or Die Hard' that is so appealing. Early on in the movie computer nerd Matt confesses to McClane, 'I am not heroic.' McClane tells Matt that the hero is 'that guy' who does what others don't do. So there is a sense of honor when McClane says to Matt later in the story, 'You're that guy' Acknowledge Willis for playing McClane as true, grizzled, and strong throughout, and Long for authentically playing a smart ass kid discovering his own power. This is a hero's story.Under Wiseman's direction the action and fight scenes are spectacular and breathtaking. Maggie Q as Mai just beats the crap out of Willis, in the brutal martial arts display. My bud Robert, pointed out to me that fight sequence was more expertly cut, rather than a demonstration of martial arts prowess. Regardless, Maggie Q is totally hot. She is absolutely beautiful and commands a powerful presence as Mai. And Bruce Willis as McClane is truly a 'Timex in a digital world'. McClane endures an amazing beating throughout. Yes, Willis also dishes out on the bad guys in kind. Bruce Willis is natural as our wisecracking hero. He is so deft at balancing smart ass and noble hero. Timothy Olyphant strikes the right tone as the icy malevolent Thomas Gabriel. Olyphant brilliantly underplays his part providing a welcome contrast to McClane. Olyphant is strikingly handsome and darkly charismatic. Justin Long as Matt expertly plays off the other actor's styles. He is funny with a light presence. Long also provides a subtle strength of character in Matt. Wiseman orchestrates all the elements together to produce great summer time entertainment. Where other big budget sequels failed 'Live Free or Die Hard' prevails with classic heroes and evil villains done with amazing energy and spirit. 'Live Free or Die Hard' is just so much fun to watch.",10,5,10,2 July 2007
X2: X-Men United," An Evolved and Matured X2
","Director Bryan Singer's 'X2: X-Men United' has evolved past a great comic book movie into a great movie. Singer along with David Hayter have stayed true to the spirit of the comic book story lines (of which I was a fan years ago..), and at the same time told a tale of humanity, tolerance, and heroes. Singer has the benefit of 'X-Men' under his belt which was itself a good movie, though very expository by nature of being the first movie. In X2 Singer amps up the action and the characters, focusing on Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Jean Grey (Framke Janssen).Logan/ Wolverine starts unraveling his forgotten past with the introduction of human villain, William Stryker (Brian Cox), a paramilitary scientist with his own personal agenda of destroying all Mutants. Stryker has a grand plan. Jean Grey starts showing symptoms of awesome and yet uncontrollable power both as a telekinetic and a telepathic-- rivaling the prowess of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). Like the comic this is an excellent foreshadowing of things to come-- in the next sequel. Jean also has romantic feelings for bad boy Logan (Jackman), though she is with Scott Sommers (James Marsden).Along the way, X2 creates great drama. Returning as Magneto is a very effective and strong Ian McKellan. Magneto and Charles Xavier (Stewart) form an unholy alliance against Stryker. This is a great touch. Magneto and Xavier possess the same goals, though opposed by ideology, sort of like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. This is a presumptuous analogy, and much like the comic book it is ambitious. And it is better to have something smart to say, rather than having nothing to say at all. Singer uses some of X2 (not all of it) to comment on the insanity of hatred against groups of people solely on the basis of being born a certain way. The true heroes of the world do their best to alter the listening of this kind of discrimination-- be it X-Men or humans-- into what is possible.Hugh Jackman really powers X2. He is a movie star. He has amazing charisma. As my friend, Jennifer, reminded me throughout the movie: 'He's hot!' He is a also a very good and versatile actor. Whether he is bravely defending the children at the Xavier School from Stryker's troops or confronting Styker in the icy forest, he is powerful. Famke Janssen is up the challenge of the evolving Jean Grey. She is beautiful, smart, and conveys a sense of honor and sadness. Brian Cox as Stryker is essential, because he is a threatening presence throughout which is key to the drama unfolding. There is a quiet and justified evil that Cox brings to the character. X2 also has Deathstrike (Kelly Hu) and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as beautiful and absolutely deadly villains.Bryan Singer and company have made a great movie--characters, action, and drama. Hopefully, Jackman and Singer will be back for X3.",10,0,0,16 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Awakens Now
","Director and writer J.J. Abrams brilliantly summons the Force in 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' in one of the great movies of the year. Along with co-writers Lawrence Kasdan and Michael Arndt, Abrams more than creates a masterful sequel; he reinvents George Lucas's 'Star Wars' mythology for a new generation leveraging a powerful new star in Daisy Ridley, who is so strong with the Force. The visuals are breathtaking whether witnessing X-wing fighters gliding across the lake of idyllic planet Takanoda or the climatic light saber duel in the dark snowy woods. However, the affinity for 'Star Wars' has always been the hero story. That was the tragic miscalculation of the last trilogy. Ridley's emergence as hero Rey embodies this legacy. Rey reveres the legend of the heroes of past and is present to a new realm of untold possibilities. 'The Force Awakens' concerns the search for Jedi Luke Skywalker, who has disappeared. Harrison Ford returns as Han Solo on board the Millennium Falcon commanding gravity and poignant affirmation of the mythos. He tells Rey and Finn (John Boyega), 'It's true. All of it.' The tribal story inspires its next generation. Ford is awesome as the older and wiser Han. He evokes the courage and touching regret of a warrior who has suffered great loss. Ford is the emotional compass of 'The Force Awakens'; Ridley is its heart. Abrams has reverence for the past as he generates boldly forward. Seeing Rey dressed in white walking across her desert home world of Jakku is eloquently reminiscent of young Luke Skywalker. In retrospect Abrams recreates numerous parallels to the first 'Star Wars', perhaps because of the tale's timeless quality? He also brings back R2-D2 and Chewbacca to the fold. In one sense the familiarity is comforting, and at times bewildering. Seeing another Death Star the size of a planet is kind of a retread. 30 years have passed since the Resistance defeated the Empire. The Empire has been replaced by The First Order, a similarly fascist galactic power, using the same battle fleet. The Sith and Emperor are gone. There is new leadership in masked Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the gigantic imaged Snoke (Andy Serkis). Princess Leia, now General Organa, is leader of the Resistance. She sends her best pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) to planet Jakku to uncover information about the missing Luke. In merciless rage Ren slaughters innocent villagers when he fails to possess what he wants. That act provokes Storm Trooper Fin (valiant and compassionate John Boyega) to abandon the The First Order. Rey is the lone scavenger barely surviving on Jakku, trading relics from the Empire fleet wreckage for food. The journey reveals itself when Han Solo enters the story. The Light and the Dark Side of the Force seem somewhat aligned. Kylo Ren yearns for the power of Darth Vader—the evil one. He is a ferocious warrior possessing great powers; however, he is conflicted by the Light. Driver does his best to display his turmoil and force, which Abrams betrays with Ren's nearly comical tantrums. Ren's Master Snoke is an enigma. Serkis relishes the malevolence. Snoke is threatening, but is he all powerful when it comes to student Ren? The new Jedi Master Maz Kanata (digital imaged Lupita Nyong) has gravitas, but is a tame focal point of the Force, rather a messenger of prophecy. Boyega as Finn is great. His Finn is the voice of conscience and faith. His charisma and charm endear Finn's journey which is unclear. As Ridley's quietly beautiful Rey wistfully gazes over the desert horizon, she captures the idealism and hope that made 'Star Wars' movie magic. Despite being alone, wanting family and connection she is the Light. The Force awakens in Rey and the hero emerges. We marvel at her power and wonder of the source. Ridley is so commanding and compassionate. Abrams fulfills the promise of 'The Force Awakens'. There are many more questions. Abrams and Ridley show that the Force can awaken in all of us. The Light or Dark Side is a choice. Let that choice be of love and courage as 'The Force Awakens'. This is a great movie.",10,3,29,25 December 2015
RED," For Honor, Love, and Laughs
","In a breathtaking sequence Bruce Willis's Frank Moses swerves his car protecting Mary-Louise Parker's Sarah Ross on-board. As the car door opens, Frank steps out, draws his Gloch, and fires into the Navigator windshield with CIA lead William Cooper (Karl Urban) behind the wheel. Retired CIA operative Frank hasn't lost his edge. 'RED' is an enjoyable surprise. Director Robert Schwentke keeps it fast, furious, and fun working from the taut clever screenplay by Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber. 'RED' is based on the DC Comic by Warren Ellis and Cully Hammer. RED stands for Retired and Extremely Dangerous. In 'RED' the CIA's most deadly retired agents find themselves targets of a covert assassination conspiracy. Now forced rogue, they must unravel the principle thread, and kill the man responsible.The charm of 'RED' underlies its character and singularity. What culminates in 'RED' is its story of honor. Bruce Willis is awesome, and at his grizzled best. I love Mary-Louise Parker, who is both quirky and sexy. Morgan Freeman is whimsically powerful. John Malkovich is completely out there as paranoid freak job Marvin. Karl Urban is amazing. As William Cooper, the CIA agent assigned to terminate Frank, he is a charismatic presence governed by a noble cause. Director Schwentke brilliantly blurs the line between good and bad, distinguishing the noble cause beyond their borders.Isolated Frank (Willis) fosters a romantic relationship with Sarah (Parker) over the phone. She is the government employee, who issues Frank his monthly pension checks. Frank is the self-imposed recluse in snowbound Cleveland. Sarah inhabits her florescent lit cubicle in the Kansas City Office. She daydreams of escaping the daily grind. Be careful what you wish for.Frank musters up the courage to ask Sarah out for a date, having business in Kansas City. Under Black Ops surveillance, a kill team strikes Frank's residence. However, Frank brutally dispatches the team with firepower and martial arts skills. Realizing the deadly conspiracy, Frank kidnaps Sarah. She admits later, ' not my best first date.' Sarah reluctantly distinguishes that she is dead without Frank. On the road and on the run they reunite with Frank's team mate Joe (Freeman) at a senior's home in New Orleans. Joe has terminal cancer. Obtaining more mission intelligence, Frank and Sarah meet up with Marvin (Malkovich), survivalist holdout and Ops LSD victim.They thwart more kill teams. In desperate resort, Frank brazenly infiltrates Langley. He obtains the Top Secret file from archive keeper played by reliable Ernest Borgnine. Frank violently schools Cooper (Urban), and barely escapes. Losses are taken; his team seeks refuge with semi-retired Victoria (amazing Helen Mirren) at her bed and breakfast in Virginia. The 'band is back together'. Apparently their operation in Guatemala 30 years ago is the fatal tie. Their assassination orders may come from the highest chain of command.Frank has a possible weakness or power—he is falling for Sarah—'I really like her.' Motherly Victoria confides, 'Frank, you're such a romantic.' On the snow covered knoll armed with her sniper rifle Victoria warns Sarah that 'if you break his heart', she will hunt her down, kill her, and bury her in the woods. Wide-eyed Sarah says, 'OK.' This is the guilty pleasure of 'RED'. 'RED' has a comic convolution and paradoxical gravitas. The cast is impeccable. Mirren is awesome. As Victoria she also compromised a past mission shooting her lover Ivan (the great Brian Cox) 3 times in the chest, following orders. At the moving story arc, Willis hugs Freeman, saying, 'It's been an honor.' Schwentke expertly balances the vibrant action, whimsy, and gravity. Ultimately, 'RED' is about fighting for the just cause, for love, and for honor. That is worth going to movies.",9,1,2,4 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Hero's Destiny
","In the darkened misty Forbidden Forest, Daniel Radcliffe as avatar Harry Potter reunites with the dearly fallen in his journey, in possession of the Resurrection Stone. Surrendering to his destiny, Harry asks, 'Does it hurt to die?' His mother Lily Potter (gentle and strong Geraldine Somerville), who sacrificed her life to protect her son from the dark Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), tells her beloved son, 'We never left.' Neither did us, after 10 years and 8 movies. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' has remarkable gravitas boldly embracing mortality and destiny. Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves poignantly complete the hero's journey in the eternal conflict of good and evil.Also coming full circle with J.K. Rowling's earlier books, 'Deathly Hallows 2' is a return to the realm of wonder and possibility. At the narrative arc with Harry in spiritual transformation, his late mentor Dumbledore (powerfully calm Michael Gambon) reminds Harry to pity the living, and those without love. The resonance of 'Harry Potter' is that the most powerful magic is love. And I have not read the Rowling's novels, only seen the movies. Alan Rickman as the seemingly duplicitous Severus Snape is awesome in the story's provocative twist. Harry had witnessed Snape murder Dumbledore, before assuming his post has Headmaster at Hogwarts. However, much like life: All is not what it seems. 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' is the timeless tale of love, honor, and redemption.The 'Harry Potter' movies strong suit has always been the supporting cast, and 'Deathly Hallows 2' is the culmination. Ralph Fiennes is the visceral commanding dark force, yet nuanced in his malevolence. His performance forges the rage and inner power in Daniel Radcliffe's evolution of Harry. Radcliffe has matured into a strong actor. Harry's journey has always been about rediscovering his true power, and reconciling his darkness and fear. Michael Gambon even in abbreviated presence brilliantly fosters the possibility of the man Harry will become. Alan Rickman as Snape virtually steals the show in an authentic display of courage and compassion all veiled in darkness. Emma Watson has grown into a compelling actor, who wields deceptive strength and presence as her Hermione has evolved into a young woman. With Rupert Grint it is difficult to distinguish, whether he is really doing anything special or that he is so present as Ron Weasley.'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' is leveled with high spirited action and vibrantly paced, as opposed to the deathly slow pacing of Part 1. There is the spectacular siege of Hogwarts by Voldermort and his minions. Yates creates amazing catharsis as Harry confronts his fate as he takes on the Dark Lord, 'Let's finish this the way we started it.' Harry, Hermione, and Ron must destroy all the Horcruxes that possess vestiges of Voldermort's soul, the leverage point of his immortality. But Voldermort must kill Harry Potter before he can become the Master of Death. Here destiny and conspiracy blur. The profound battle of good and evil and the possession of Harry's very soul are left in the powerful and convincing performances of Fiennes, Rickman and Gambon. Like Harry's Mother reminds, 'Harry, you are so lovedÂ…' We were always for Harry, and will always be.",10,2,3,2 August 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The Fellowship Complete
","At the very end of Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King', when the extraordinary Annie Lennox sings the beautiful song, 'Into the West', it occurred to me that this is not just an end to the epic trilogy, rather it marks it's completion. The distinction being that this ambitious undertaking of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle Earth is now whole and complete. We have witnessed the transformation of the story's characters, be it Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), or Gandalf (Ian McKellen). They are not the same characters that we saw in 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Jackson has powerfully told a tale of the cost of doing what is right in one's heart, of courage, of loyalty, and of love. And I say this not having read the Tolkien books. Though I appreciate and respect that Tolkien is the Shakespeare of a specific generation. In Minas Tirith preparing for the final battle, an aging and worn Wizard Gandalf tells his charge Pippin, who fears death in the coming war, 'End? No, the journey doesn't end here. There is another path; one that we all must take...' Ultimately, 'Return of the King' is about having faith, and that things work out just the way they do. Director Peter Jackson along with screen writers Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson himself are the master storytellers of the tech era. Unlike some other trilogies (or ones yet to be completed), Jackson and crew weave a tapestry of spectacular visual effects and cutting edge CGI, with a transparent narrative style, and stunning acting throughout. Jackson's art is one of balance in the realm of apparent chaos.'Return of the King' starts where 'Two Towers' ended. We have an insight into Gollum (Andy Serkis) who is guiding Frodo and Sam to Mount Doom to destroy The Ring; thus, ending Sauron's reign over Middle Earth. Aragorn and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) must find the mysterious army in the Cursed Mountians to battle Sauron's legions. They are all willing to sacrifice their lives to distract the Eye of Sauron, so that Frodo can destroy the Ring. We also discover that Arwen (Liv Tyler) has forsaken her Elf immortality to be with her love, Aragorn. Credit Jackson and his actors for providing a believable evolution of the story's characters. In 'Return of the King' Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn truly becomes regal, and the charismatic leader of men. Mortensen has powerful screen presence, and has a calmness about him that is noble and just. Elijah Wood's Frodo constantly fights the seductive power of The Ring. Wood has a great innocence and drive that works in the role. Sean Astin as Sam really emerges as the movie's hero. Astin's performance is strong and provides the movie's heart. He brings an authenticity to Sam's selflessness and humanity. Astin's performance deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The one actor under used in this all is Liv Tyler-- she had little to do here and in the last movie. This is shame being that she is a talented actress. Peter Jackson is truly to be acknowledged for completing an epic tale with 'Return of the King', and for the entire 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. This is a historic feat, and his work will be enjoyed for generation to come. I will miss seeing the annual 'Lord of the Rings' movie at Christmases. I will also look forward to Jackson's next screen project.",10,0,1,26 January 2004
Munich," Justice or Vengeance?
","Gandhi said, 'An eye for an eye only makes the whole world blind.' What distinguishes justice from vengeance? This echoes throughout Steven Spielberg's 'Munich'. 'Munich' is powerful and perhaps Spielberg's most compelling and thought provoking work. He weaves a tapestry of political and social threads focusing on terrorism and the cost of violence. 'Munich' is truly amazing in balancing linear storytelling and horrific acts of violence, demonstrating the impact of the aftermath. Spielberg's 'Munich' seen through the eyes of Eric Bana's Avner is a powerful allegory that even in the most just and noble fights against terror we eventually become that which we despise. 'Munich' really serves as a reminder. Mossad team leader Avner played by Eric Bana is absolutely riveting as the man who begins this righteous cause only to find that the cost is his soul. Anver asks, 'When does it ever end?' At the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered the Israeli wrestling team. This political statement was seen around the world and depicted in gory detail by Director Spielberg. Based on the book 'Vengeance' by George Jones, the screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth tells the story of the aftermath of this tragedy. A great Lynn Cohen who plays Prime Minister Golda Meir says, 'Every civilization finds it necessary to negotiate compromises with its own values.' Poetic words for what follows are a search and destroy mission. The Mossad assembles a team lead by Avner (Bana) to track down and kill with extreme prejudice all those involved in the terrorist action in Munich. 11 names are identified for execution. These executions are also intended to serve as statements. Anver though an inexperienced operative and not an assassin is selected for the covert mission by Ephriam (the great Geoffrey Rush) for being a strong and effective leader of men. The assassin team is composed of Steve (Daniel Craigthe next James Bond), Carl (Ciaran Hinds), Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), and Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are dissociated from the Mossad, i.e. they technically don't exist.In accepting the lead, Avner must leave his beautiful and pregnant wife Daphna (a very strong Ayelet Zorer) for what could be a number of years. Carl has his doubts about Avner, telling him that he was chosen because he is a 'good soldier'. Soon Carl respects Avner for his quiet force and conscience. Attack of conscience and paranoia soon engulf the team as they become entrenched in the world of underground intelligence for hire. Avner pays large sums of money for information on the whereabouts of his targets from Louis (wonderfully shady Mathiew Amalric) and his wealthy Papa (weary and noble Michael Lonsdale). Avner soon finds that whomever he kills is eventually replaced, and that he and potentially his family is now a target for the terrorists he was assigned to hunt down and kill. The realization is that it truly never ends. Bana is amazing as a trapped animal in the scene in his thrashed apartmentsearching for weapons of his demise. Paranoia sets in, and the path of justice and vengeance become blurred. In a poignant scene Robert pleads to Avner, 'When I lose my righteousness, I lose everything' Nothing about 'Munich' is easy, though it is simple. I believe that is Steven Spielberg's intention. 'Munich' could be tighter in spots, though this does not diminish the movie's power and impact. Eric Bana emerges as the noble hero battling to salvage his own humanity and his very soul. 'When does it ever end?' Perhaps even in the current context there is no real answermaybe what Spielberg is getting at. It is a reminder of our humanity, that even the most righteous cause may cost our souls. 'Munich' is truly a powerful movie worth seeing.",10,249,341,7 January 2006
300," Honor and Respect
","Director and Writer Zack Snyder's '300' is visually stunning and inspired storytelling. Snyder along with co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon tell the legendary story of the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans held off the Persian army of up to perhaps 1 million soldiers for 3 days at a beach passage. The Spartans all died to a man. The resonance of their courageous action may have inspired the formation of the Greek Republic. The movie is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. Snyder's '300' derives its look from Miller's comic book. '300' also has the distinction of being filmed entirely in front of a green screen. Consequently, '300' has an intentionally stylized look in tone and atmosphere. What are surprising is the touching pathos, and the effective performances amidst the dramatic hyperbole. Snyder's '300' is by no means a study in subtle; however, leads Gerard Butler and Lena Headey are amazing in the display of the unsaid.'300' got me in an opening training scene with King Leonidas (Butler) and his young son. Leonidas tells his son the lesson is 'Respect and honor.' That is the context for '300'. When the Persian Emissary questions Leonidas's wife's presence in their meeting, Queen Gorgo (Headey) says, 'Spartan women give birth to real men.' The Spartan code is never surrender. So when the Persian King Xerxes demands Sparta's submission the answer is obvious, and the course of action mandated. Leonidas enrolls 300 of his best warriors to battle the overwhelming Persian army. Gorgo says to Leonidas , 'Come back with your shield, or on it' Leonidas loves Gorgo more than life, and that too goes unsaid. '300' is about honor, respect, and love. The movie is visually stunning and the fight scenes are spectacular. There is an amazing panoramic shot of Leonidas (Butler) dispatching a dozen Persian soldiers with shield and spear as he runs across the screen. '300' is blood and gore executed with great style and skill.I was fortunate to see a screening of the movie, and listen to Visual Effects Supervisor Chris Watts. Chris talked about the look of the movie and the challenges of bringing to life the ambitious goals of the movie given his resources. All the actors in '300' look totally ripped. Someone asked Chris if he digitally enhanced anyone's physique. Chris said that the actors trained rigorously for 8 weeks, and that there were 'no digital abs'. The Spartans in '300' do look awesome. And the actors captured the Spartan warrior spirit and nobility. Gerard Bulter gives a breakthrough performance as Leonidas, King of Sparta. Butler is a powerful and commanding presence that is larger than life, as dictated by the story. He also effectively tempers this with a subtle introspection and an underlying compassion. Lena Headey is an unexpected delight. As Queen Gorgo she leverages her beauty and strength, and is as compelling and driving force as Leonidas. Headey gives an understated hero's performance. The supporting cast is excellent. David Wenham is strong as Spartan Dilios, also the story's narrator. Vincent Regan embodies a father's pride and torment as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro fittingly provides a larger than life arrogance as Xerxes.Zack Snyder's '300' is inspired movie making, and just plain fun to watch. Gerard Butler and Lena Headey give star-making performances. Unfortunately, '300' does not lend itself easily to a sequel, given the nature of the story. However, anything is possible in Hollywood. Consequently, Zack Snyder has distinguished himself as a talented director of vision and passion. Keep an eye out for Snyder's next project.",10,5,12,18 March 2007
The Hangover Part III," Funny?
","The first surprise about 'The Hangover III' : there is no hangover. Secondly, 'The Hangover III' is not very funny. What happened? A little Mr. Chow and Alan go a long way. And there is way too much of Ken Jeong and Zack Galifianakis in H3. Director Todd Phillips strategically miscalculates focusing them in the foreground instead of the back. I actually thought 'The Hangover II' set in Thailand was hysterical, even though it was criticized for being a clone of 'The Hangover'. 'The Hangover' was inspired originality—one of the funniest movies ever. Amazing Bradley Cooper returns as solid Phil. He is the straight man relegated to saying, 'What the f***?' Granted seeing nominated Cooper in 'Silver Linings Playbook', he has outgrown this, and I acknowledge his loyalty. Anyway, I am in complete agreement with Phil.'The Hangover III' comes full circle and concludes the trilogy in Las Vegas. Mercifully, what happens in Vegas should stay there. In a bizarre twist H3 is more an action movie than comedy—very disappointing and totally baffling. This is not the comic equivalent of 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Promisingly, John Goodman enters as mob heavy Marshall who again takes kidnapping steady Doug (Justin Bartha). This vendetta relates to Mr. Chow (Jeong) stealing money from H1. Philips and Craig Mazin's erratic script douses whatever possible hysterics. Stu (steady Ed Helms) is not the butt of the thematic joke. Heather Graham reprises as Jade, the stripper single Mom, but her talents are not at all leveraged. We are mostly left with Alan and Chow's bewildering bromance. Again, this gets old after about 15 minutes.Dark comedy abounds in the beginning with a gruesome giraffe highway sequence and a really disturbing family death all surrounding clueless Alan (Galifianakis). This summons The Wolfpack to intervene on Alan's behalf and well-being. The tragic flaw is that Alan is vastly unsympathetic. The best narrative consequence of it all is Cassie played by uncompromisingly funny Melissa McCarthy. H3 does have its moments particularly with Alan's man-crush on Phil. In a ridiculous exchange Alan ask Phil about his shirt, 'Is that from Diesel?' Risking his life scaling down the hotel balcony, Alan takes a Smartphone photo of Phil. Phil asks, 'Did you get that?' Too bad there isn't more of that instead of chases and shooting.The funniest scene of H3 occurs at the very end. Stu is the object of a visual joke that is laugh out loud hysterical. Seems to me that should have been the premise of 'The Hangover III', where the Boys seem completely at home. What a squandered opportunity. I guess we can take solace that they were funny before.",8,0,0,1 August 2013
Easy A," 'A' is for Awesome
","According to Emma Stone's Olive, 'A is for Awesome.' 'Easy A' is the funny smart movie of the year. Director Will Gluck's fresh mashing of Hawthorne's 'The Scarlet Letter' in this Twitter Age is whimsical, genuine, and hysterical. Emma Stone is absolutely amazing. Writer Bert V. Royal's screenplay brilliantly captures the angst and social perils of kids of this Facebook generation. Royal completes his story with touching narrative arcs and twists, and a valiant hero in Emma Stone. 'Easy A' is reminiscent of 'Juno' in its clever and biting dialog. Where in 'Juno' no one in real life actually speaks with those razor-like smarts, 'Easy A' is witty and sharp in natural speak.Stone's Olive is a smart ass, but never over the top. She is the straight man, self-aware of the social 'no win' she finds herself imprisoned. During the staged fake tryst, Olive (Stone) locks herself with Brandon (exasperated funny Dan Byrd) in a friend's bedroom. Brandon is gay and tormented everyday at school for just being. Olive reluctantly agrees to this public staging to recreate his reputation anew. When Olive removes her thong as part of the theatrics, Brandon freaks. Olive says, 'Do you think I have a gnome down there?' Brandon defends that she is not his type. Duh. Olive surmises could it be: 'I have a V, not a P.' Gluck and Royal orchestrate hysterically. Stone has natural impeccable timing. 'Easy A' had won me over at this juncture.Olive is a smart and decent high school student in Ojai, CA. She is never in trouble— in fact nearly invisible. Olive gets caught in a lie, to avoid going on a camping trip with her BFF Rhiannon (charmingly spacey Aly Michalka) and her disturbing New Age parents. Olive tells Rhi that she had a one night stand with a college freshman over the weekend—really she was comically alone at home. School Christian Crusade Leader Marianne (gloriously bitchy Amanda Bynes) overhears Olive's restroom confession. Literally at the speed of light Tweets and texts broadcast Olive's promiscuity. Later Marianne tells Olive she will be judged by a higher power. Olive responds, 'Did I just get saved?' 'Easy A' opens with Olive's webcast, which is genius. She confesses, 'There are 2 sides to every story. This is my side—the right one.' Olive's good intentions to resuscitate social outcasts by 'fake rocking their worlds' soon make her a pariah. She is getting Auto Zone gift cards to have faux sex with boys seeking credibility. Olive's favorite teacher Mr. Griffith (disguised aloof Thomas Hayden Church) becomes concerned when she transforms, and wears bus tiers emblazoned with the scarlet letter A. She is reading 'The Scarlet Letter' in English class. Also worried is Griffith's Guidance Counselor wife (wacky Lisa Kudrows). Olive's parents note the red flags. Her Mom (wonderfully loopy Patricia Clarkson) remarks that she looks like a stripper-- albeit 'high end' according to her Dad (hysterically wise Stanley Tucci).However, on a transactional date Olive realizes that someone crossed the whore line. Fortunately, 'Lobster' Todd rescues her. Todd (gentle and strong Penn Badgley) says he dismisses the rumors about Olive. He always remembers the beautiful 7th grader, who was kind to him. Olive too has always been in love Todd, since then. This is the distinguishing charm of 'Easy A'. Although Olive is in the adolescent abyss, the people that know her soul like Todd and her parents have faith in her. In a hilarious dinner scene Olive requests that her parents dismiss the rumors of Chlamydia—apparently no big deal. Even her Dad tells her vehemently and comically, 'I would take a bullet for you.' Her Mom understands completely. While gazing at the stars she tells her daughter that when she too was young she slept with a lot of people—'mostly guys'.'Easy A' poignantly captures and reminds us of the painful teen angst of fitting in, and just being allowed to be. When overweight dweeb Evan (sympathetic Jameson Moss) begs Olive to say that she had sex with him, she asks him why? Brandon says, 'Just look at me.' You can see the heartbreak in Stone's visage. While Olive is confronted by picketers, Todd tells her, 'Screw all these people, Olive!' Ultimately, 'Easy A' gets an 'A' for its story about having the courage to take a stand, doing what is right despite what people think. Emma Stone is our hero on this journey. She is cute and has such a radiant spirit. She wins us over whether she is singing 'Pocket Full of Sunshine' in the shower or seeing the suffering in her eyes when she realizes that she shattered the life of someone dear. 'Easy A' is one of the best movies of the year. It's the kind of movie that is dismissed by the Academy, when it shouldn't. Perhaps, one day.",10,49,68,19 September 2010
Fast Five," Vin and The Rock in Summer Fun Movie
","Showcasing Director Justin Lin's signature accelerated precision, Vin Diesel's Dom races beside the speeding train as Paul Walker's Brian leaps into Dom's sports car. Their car immediately careens over a steep chasm into the river below. Diesel and Walker leap in midair out of the car, and plunge into the water. 'Fast Five' is just great fun. Writer Chris Morgan's story is better than the last 'Fast and Furious', which isn't saying much. Then again we don't see 'Fast Five' for the narrative nuances. Non-stop action reigns supreme. Lin has a crisp vibrant visual style, and acumen for insane action. Lin has two cars racing through the streets of Rio dragging a bank vault unleashing mass destruction. Granted this is over the top, and completely original. 'Fast Five' has stunning Rio de Janeiro locals, gorgeous women, fast cars, and Vin Diesel squaring off against 'The Rock' Dwayne Johnson. Lin has methodically checked off all the boxes.The theme of family distinguishes 'Fast Five' from completely superfluous fare. In a quiet moment Dom reminisces about his father. He remembers him working all day, and staying up late at night helping his sister Mia with her homework. He recalls the generous neighborhood barbecues he had. Conversely, Brian has regrets about his father, 'He just wasn't around.' Perhaps he has chance to alter his fate. Amidst the flash, 'Fast Five' earnestly adheres to family and loyalty.The band is back together in 'Fast Five', for one last heist. If I am not mistaken one of the band, Han played by Sung Kang died in a previous Lin directed sequel. Stranger things have happened. The accelerated opening sequence recaps the rescue of Dom Toretto, where the last movie ended. Federal agent Brian O'Connor and Dom's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) daringly execute the operation to free Dom from serving an undeserved life sentence. In context what else could that be? Dom risked his life to help Brian solve a heinous crime and bring killer to justice. Lin throttles the adrenaline and velocity in this deadly game of chicken with a prison bus. This is only an omen of things to come.As 'Fast Five' resumes, Mia (Brewster) and Brian (Walker) have been on the run in Rio. They are seeking to rendezvous with Dom (Diesel). Dom has one last heist in mind: robbing the bank vault in the Rio Police Station with $100 million of crime lord Reyes (slick and villainous Joaquim de Alemeida). Apparently, Reyes' rule and influence knows no bounds in Rio. So Dom assembles his old team. Dwayne Johnson, massive hard muscle, shaved head and goatee, plays singular and intense Federal Agent Hobbs, who is out to bring Dom to justice. He instructs Rio official to 'Stay the f*** out of my way.' Hobbs and his team always get their man. As Hobbs, Johnson is imposing and handles guns and his fists with explosive results. Of course we are waiting for Vin to take on The Rock in the final epic battle. Chris Morgan ingeniously stacks the story. Dom is the thief with a code. Hobbs is the cop with honor. Reyes is the true villain. Much like gravity, we can kind of figure how things will fall.Predictability is some of the charm of 'Fast Five'. Vin Diesel plays to his minimalist strength as Dom. Emotive is not his deal, but that is not required here. He commands the screen, and often surprises in his underplay. Paul Walker has become a pretty good actor. Not much is demanded of him here. He deftly uses his charm and smarts. The Rock is great as Hobbs. He imposes as a formidable rival. Here Johnson's straight arrow persona leverages the story's ultimate conflict. 'Fast Five' is not going to win any awards. It is just great fun. I look forward to the next sequel.",9,0,1,14 May 2011
Green Book," The Courage to Change People's Hearts
","In 1962, in the middle of the night, in the pouring rain, in the Deep South Mahershala Ali's concert pianist Dr. Don Shirley in tears tells his driver Tony, played by Viggo Mortensen, 'So if I'm not Black enough! If I'm not White enough! If I'm not Man enough! So tell me what am I?' Tony listens in resound silence. That resonates even in 2018. This is the lyrical power of Writer and Director Peter Farrelly's 'Green Book'.The screenplay by Nick Vellelonga, Brian Hayes Currie, and Farrelly is based on the true story of the friendship of Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Vellelonga, who couldn't be more different or more unlikely. The wondrous screenplay authentically looks at the impact of prejudice with heart and a surprising sense of humor. On Tony and Don's road trip on their concert tour, Don delicately fingers his Kentucky Fried Chicken drumstick in the backseat, while Tony drives. Don has never eaten fried chicken before. Don admits it's actually quite good. I laughed so hard.Tony agrees to chauffer and 'bodyguard' Don on his concert tour in the Deep South for 8 weeks, returning home to his understanding wife Dolores, plays by kind beautiful Linda Cardellini, by Christmas. Viggo's Tony was the bouncer, 'public relations' man at the Copacabana Club in New York City shutdown because of a mob 'misunderstanding'. Tony is blue collar Italian American with street smarts: way wiser than he occurs. The Father of two boys, he's all heart.
Tony also pays attention. Viggo's distinct humanity is in being so present.Back in the 1960's the Green Book was the listing of all the approved Lodgings for Blacks. At times Tony and Don were not allowed to share the same hotels. On the one instance they do Tony looks out from his hotel room balcony. He spies solitary Don, alone sipping his glass of whiskey. There's more to Don's story than divorce and his estranged brother. Mahershala embodies a regal self-absorbed suffering in Don, who along with being the accomplished pianist holds two PhDs and a law degree. He is also very alone. Is his loneliness self-imposed or thwarted self-expression?Here Director Peter unconceals eloquent acceptance in the narrative. Don gratefully thanks Tony for saving him from himself. Tony compassionately says, 'I know it's complicated.' Later Don asks to see the letters Tony writes home to Dolores. They're horrendous. Consequently, Don dictates to Tony what to write, 'Dear Dolores...'Viggo and Mahershala amaze in their authentic love and soulful respect for each other. Mahershala is the brilliant straight man when comedy summons. He displays powerful awareness on the stark narrative turns. Viggo is masterful understatement. His Tony has his prejudice as we all do, yet through his eyes we see his compassion and deep regard for the man that Don is.Viggo's visage as Tony acknowledges the miraculous talents of artist Don. Don and his musical trio play for White privileged folk, who seemingly feign tolerance. Soon Tony discerns the pretense as mere tokenism, cloaked racism. So why does Don hold his tongue, graciously thanking his hosts, who only see him as Negro?Don's band mate Oleg, played by silently strong Dimiter D. Marinov, tells Tony, '... Because it takes courage to change people's hearts.' Amen. Maybe we can't change what's in other people's hearts. What we can to do is have compassion in our own hearts. That's a place to start.That's the profound brotherhood of Tony and Don's journey. 'Green Book' may be the very best movie of the year. At least it's my very favorite.",10,3,6,26 November 2018
Fantastic Four," Pretty Fantastic Four
","As a kid, years ago, I remember being a fan of 'The Fantastic Four' comic and the cartoon series. Predictably, I had an affinity for Reed Richards, the cool scientist guy. So for years I had been curious regarding the comic's translation to the big screen. 'The Fantastic Four' had been swirling in the motion picture winds longer than other Marvel Superheroes including X-Men and Spider-Man. Director Tim Story's retelling of the comic in his movie, 'Fantastic Four', rekindles fond memories, and updates the tale with a playful feel and edge. In a departure from previous Superhero movies like X-Men and Spider-Man, 'Fantastic Four' is not high drama, nor an exploration into the nature of hero. 'X-Men' and 'Spider-Man' are superior movies. This is Superhero lite. This is not a bad thing, only different. Really. Much like one of it's characters, Johnny Storm (The Human Torch), it's all X-Games edge. These are the Gen-X Superheroes. It's all about the rush. Writers Michael France and Mark Frost deliver the difficult Act I narrative of the origins of the Fantastic Four. The story is frenetic, although weak on character development. This pitfall is overcome mostly, by excellent casting. Ioan Gruffdd has the right 'dork' touch for brilliant scientist Reed Richards. Jessica Alba, though seemingly too young for the role of Sue Storm, is strong and sensible. Chris Evans steals the movie as Extreme Sports Astronaut washout, Johnny Storm. Michael Chiklis elicits pathos as Ben Grimm, who becomes embodied in the rock of the Thing. Julian McMahon as Victor Von Doom is very cool evil.Richards and company along with Von Doom, embark on a venture to study the affects of a Radiation Storm passing Earth aboard Von Doom's space station. Due to Reed's miscalculation, the crew is caught unprepared for the storm's early arrival. All five members are exposed to the severe radiation; thus, altering their DNA. My bud Ron, reminded me that Doom in the comics had a different fate. However, this revision actually is more compelling. Back on Earth, Reed, Sue, Johnny, Ben, and Victor develop astonishing powers. Victor takes a decidedly dark turn. Reed's body has amazing stretching ability. Sue can become invisible and project force fields. Johnny can ignite into flames at will. Ben becomes a rock-like monster with incredible strength. Victor transforms into a metal creature able to harness and disperse great energy. So the Fantastic Four must battle the now powerful Dr. Doom (Victor).In another extreme culture departure as illustrated by Johnny Storm, he embraces his Superhero status like that of being a rock star. It is not a curse. Reed asks Johnny whether there is any higher pursuit than making a lot of money and meeting girls. Johnny says, 'No.' Props for Johnny. Chris Evans as Johnny Storm has the right elements of bravado, and playfulness. That can also be said for rest of the movie. Ioan Gruffud has the canny stiffness that is appropriate for Reed Richards, providing a contrast. Jessica Alba is believable as Sue. She is also very hot. She is even naked in the movie, unfortunately her character is invisible. Michael Chiklis is very sympathetic as the tortured Thing. Julian McMahon revels as the evil Victor Von Doom.'The Fantastic Four' is great summer entertainment. There will be sequel. Perhaps, FF2 retains it's extreme sports sensibilities, and focuses a little more on character.",7,0,1,31 July 2005
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," She Loves Someone Else
","When Sting performed with The Royal Philharmonic at The Hollywood Bowl, he said in his experience there are two kinds of love songs. There is 'I love you, and you love me.'—very circular. Then there is 'I love you, and you love someone else.' –which is the more interesting. 'The Twilight Saga: Eclipse' aligns with the latter. In 'Eclipse' vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) protect their beloved Bella (Kristen Stewart) from merciless 'Newborn' Riley (charismatic Xavier Samuel), who means to kill her with his powerful army of vampire. Edward and Jacob, literally mortal enemies by blood, are both in love with Bella. Bella must choose, reconcile her own heart, and her future as human or soulless immortal.In the opening of 'Eclipse' Stewart reads Robert Frost's 'Fire and Ice' to Pattinson about the end of the world—metaphor for this story arc. 'Eclipse' is not as eloquent as a Sting love song, and under the orchestration of Director David Slade and Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg (adapting Stephanie Meyer's novel) is captivating action packed melodrama. Granted I am not a fan of the books or the demographic. 'Eclipse' is much better than 'New Moon'. The tone is darker, and enhanced by Howard Shore's score. This time around Slade and Rosenberg infuse a sense of humor about their material. In one scene Edward asks regarding shredded werewolf Jacob, 'Does he ever wear a shirt?' Although at times the dialogue seems as awkward as a George Lucas movie—this may have more to do with the source material? In a tent on an icy night atop a mountain, Edward (Pattinson) and Jacob (Lautner) talk man to man about their profound love for Bella—each risking their life. Jacob asks Edward what if Bella chooses not to be with him. Edward says, 'Then I will let her go.' Jacob ends with a cute comment instead of acknowledging a mutual respect. Beholding to Meyer's material frequently keeps the movie from soaring. I think Rosenberg could have refined, matured, and retained the spirit.Much of 'Eclipse' is uneven. Elsewhere Rosenberg and Meyer exact eloquence. With amazing poignancy Rosalie Cullen (sad and beautiful Nikki Reed) implores Bella (Stewart) to reconsider her choice to become vampire—'You are frozen, never moving forward.' No possibility. Pattison's Edward pleads with Bella to consider her choice to 'turn'. He forfeited his very soul, and the paradox that he tells her is, 'I will protect your soul'. Perhaps, this is the very essence of the vampire vogue. The Vampire is the ultimate existential hero. He is immortal, but by nature destroys the object of his love. He lives forever, and is forever alone. Kristen Stewart as Bella embodies the angst and longing, but I think the narrative fails in underscoring the consequences of her humanity choice. Rosenberg gracefully enlightens the consequences of eternity with the past lives of Rosalie (Reed) and Jasper Hale (amazingly strong Jackson Rathbone). Rathbone is a surprise from the last 2 movies, as he commands as a leader instructing the Cullen's and the Werewolf to combat the powerful Newborn.The Newborn are newly born vampire with insatiable blood lust and very powerful—stronger than the Cullens. Alice Cullen (stunning and strong Ashley Greene) has a vision of the army of Newborns lead by the Riley (Samuel) coming to kill Bella. However, Riley is a mere puppet of the malevolent Victoria (coldly compelling Bryce Dallas Howard), who seeks vengeance upon Edward (Pattinson)? Also lurking in the shadows is the powerful and calculated Jane (understatedly evil Dakota Fanning) of the omniscient vampire Voltari. Here unlike 'New Moon' the catharsis completes with the bloody battle between good and evil with lives and souls in the balance. Pattison is commanding and passionate as Edward transforms into the great hero he is destined. He balances Edward's humanity as he fights for the soul of his eternal love. All culminates in the showdown with Edward, Victoria, and Riley—nice modern mythology.'Eclipse' is a welcome and satisfying surprise. It is Gothic love story in the midst of the battle of good against great evil, and classic hero story as well. Pattison and Stewart are amazing, and smooth out some of the narrative turbulence. 'Eclipse' is well worth seeing, and now I look forward to the next 'Twilight'.",8,4,11,4 July 2010
Click," Family Comes First
","In 'Click' Adam Sandler plays Michael Newman, who comes to possess a miraculous 'universal remote' that literally controls his entire universe including fast forward and skip features. However, left unchecked Michael skips the unpleasant and fast forwards to the good parts of his life, and he misses years of his life and also years in the lives of those he loves. This clever story is a little unexpected coming from Adam Sandler, who gives one of his best performances. Frank Coraci's direction of the story by Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe seamlessly shifts from frivolous comedy to poignant sentimentality. I have read movie reviews that have slammed 'Click' for being shamelessly sentimental. What else is it supposed to be? Granted Koren and O'Keefe's story is uneven with some distractingly stupid gags. However, their point is that for most of us, if we are not truly present in own lives will run in auto pilot or fast forward, and miss out on the things that are really important in life. So when Sandler's Michael comes to the realization that 'Family comes first.' that resonates with us. 'Click' also gets points for being fun and funny. Coraci balances the message and the comedy, in the context of the love story of Michael and Donna (the amazing and beautiful Kate Beckinsale).Michael Newman (Sandler) is an architect on the fast track with his firm. Michael works ridiculous hours and that places a tremendous strain on his family-- for his wife Donna and his kids Ben (Joseph Castanon) and Samantha (Tatum McCann). Michael's boss Amner (a very funny David Hasselhoff) is demanding and completely clueless. Michael's future as firm partner depends on making Amner look good. One night when Michael is working a deadline, the DVD remote goes out, and he must watch that client DVD. So Michael heads to his local Bed, Bath, and Beyond. In the 'Beyond' section Michael meets apparent mad scientist Morty (awesome Christopher Walken). Morty gives Michael the 'state-of-the-art' universal remote, under the condition that he can't return it. Morty tells Michael, 'Even nice guys need to catch a break' Back home Michael realizes the actual power of his universal remote. There are the associated high jinx involved with the mute, slow motion, and fast forward features. Michael is a good guy, who thinks that by getting ahead and being successful in his career is the best way he can provide for his family. He loves his family dearly, and he soon realizes that he is responsible for how his life works out. Years go by in a flash and things don't always turn out as you intend. Michael learns, 'Be careful what you wish for.' Adam Sandler plays his standard smart ass self balanced with amazing vulnerability and compassion. This is so refreshing. Sandler also demonstrates a depth of range as his Michael goes through the different character arcs. He is touching when he tells Donna (Beckinsale) the love of his life, 'Forever and ever.' He is heartbreaking in a scene with his father (excellent Henry Winkler), when he realizes that his father always loved him, but as his son he never told his Dad how much he loved him. Along with Sandler, Beckinsale's Donna also ages over the years. She is just rock solid and carries Michael and Donna's relationship as it evolves to catharsis. Beckinsale is light and funny and at the same time has a gentle strength. Christopher Walken is awesome as Morty. As Michael's guide he brings the right touch of whimsy and gravitas. Morty turns out to be more than just a guide. Sandler, Beckinsale, and Walken expertly navigate 'Click''s journey from standard comedy to sentimental and reflective.'Click' is funny and ultimately touching and poignant. An unexpected surprise. In a departure from his standard fare, Adam Sandler is at his vulnerable best. Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken are great. This is Sandler's version of Frank Capra. It's different, and definitely worth watching.",9,1,5,1 July 2006
John Wick: Chapter 2," For love
","A few days ago I was talking with one of my friends at the YMCA. I told him over the weekend that I saw 'John Wick: Chapter 2', again. He said,' You really must like it.' I said, 'Yes.' I told him that I thought 'John Wick: Chapter 2' was the best action movie of the last 10 years. Keanu Reeves is awesome. The movie has this 'strange love story' that makes it very clear what John fights for. I liked 'John Wick' a lot. His tale of bloody vengeance about his dead dog and missing vintage sports car reveals in the end as the metaphor for his late wife Helen, played by Bridget Moynahan—the love of his life. John's lost love story. In 'John Wick: Chapter 2' what John fights for is completely transparent. Keanu Reeves's John is the retired master assassin, forced back into 'the game'. John's friend Winston, played by Ian McShane, tells Santino, played by Riccardo Scamarcio that he called back John on the marker which allowed him to have a life with Helen, and he betrayed John as well. Winston warns Santino that John will 'kill him', because 'He came back for love.' I got the movie then. 'John Wick 2' is the great B-action movie that becomes the powerful story about John's lost love story. Derek Kolstad's screenplay is minimalist clarity. Reeves is awesome in the brutal and spectacular martial arts and gun displays. As John he is eloquently understated, wounded, and full of focused rage. The fighting sequence where John takes out assassins in the subway is electrifying and immaculate. Reeves creates John as the tragic hero, who fights for honor and the love of his departed soul mate. As one of John's intended victims lays in a bathing pool, she asks him, 'John, do you fear damnation?' John sits next to her and says, 'Yes.' Without Helen, he feels sentenced to hell. In the opening scene John steals his mustang back from his enemy. John is relentless. In the scene in the garage, he dispatches literally dozens of trained killers with Muay Thai, Jujitsu, Aikido, and boxing. The fight choreography is clean and devastating. Reeves has mastered his arts. He retrieves his car and spares his enemy. We discover that the car was not important to him—rather what was in it. John wants normalcy and calm. He even has a new dog—without a name. However, Satino calls upon the blood marker that had set John free. The marker bounds John to do whatever Santino requests. Santino wants John to murder his sister Gianna, played by beautiful and dark Claudi Gerini. Gianna has ascended to the seat on in the international crime circle. The seat that Santino felt is rightfully his. John refuses: 'I'm not that guy anymore.' Santino and his men wreak havoc upon John and his home. John and his dog find sanctuary in the Continental Hotel run by his friend Winston. The Continental is sanctuary for all assassins. However, by its code all markers must be honored. Therefore, John must kill Gianna. If he refuses, he dies. If he kills her, he dies. That is John's mortal curse. Director Chad Stahelski has an authentic feel for the hero and the villain. He possesses instinct for action. Bruce Lee might have said his action is 'like water'—it flows with impact. The martial arts with and without guns is brutally exquisite. Cinematographer Dan Laustsen captures the continuous flow whether in the dark tunnels of Italy or the all white lit subway. Stahelski has great homage to 'Enter the Dragon' in the climatic fight in mirrored rooms. Stahelski's John is focused and empathetic, because of his cause. There is strange satisfaction watching John take out trained assassins, who think they are tough, when John is just being that. John gets beat up badly, as well, but he never stops. His flashbacks to John's Helen sustain an ironic poignancy. Common's Cassian, who is Gianna's protector, is John's arch rival, who has code and honor. On the other hand, Scamarcio's Santino occurs as a prissy coward hiding behind his army of warriors. Reeves is made to play John. His controlled impassiveness expresses his deep rage and loss. We are all for John. There must be justice in the world—or at least in the world of movies. 'John Wick: Chapter 2' is bloody and singular, and John fights for his lost love story. Somehow that makes a difference. See 'John Wick: Chapter 2'. It's a great movie.",10,0,3,26 February 2017
Incredibles 2," Don't fire the baby...
","Bob Parr, retired Superhero Mr. Incredible now Mr. Mom, voiced by Craig T. Nelson, discovers that his infant son Jack-Jack, goo goo-ed by Eli Fucile, shoots deadly green lasers from his eyes. He cautions his older daughter Violet, voiced by Sarah Vowell, and her younger brother Dash, voiced by Huck Milner, while playing with their brother, 'Don't fire the baby!' Now, you won't hear that in movies. I'll even go out on a limb here.That's the signature humor and inventiveness of Writer and Director Brad Bird's 'Incredibles 2'. 'Incredibles 2' is really incredible, too. '2' is the sequel 14 years in the making. The technological advance in state-of-the art animation since astounds. In the visual high speed chase Helen's Elastic Girl, voiced with down home charm and common sense by Holly Hunter, swerves her motorcycle as she rescues the out-of-control monorail train. In the stunning night skyline Elastic Girl hops between helicopters with her rubber-like arms to save the Ambassador. Still with Bird flexing his formidable CGI might, he touches when Bob confesses to daughter Violet, 'I just want to be a good Dad.' Nelson is humorous and vulnerable as the Dad. Bob was responsible for her possible boyfriend Tony's imposed memory loss to guard the family's identity. Violet is devastated when Tony forgets their movie date. Yeah, Dad and Mom using their super strength and elastic powers stopped the villainous Underminer, comical John Ratzenberger, and his hulking drilling machine. Bob messed up big time where it also counted, with family. Family and heart ultimately save the day in 'Incredibles 2'. 'Incredibles 2' is hysterical in its cool self-awareness and irreverence. '2' has the hip retro 60's vibe in its art deco design and music score by Michael Giacchino. You get the feel of a James Bond or 'In Like Flint' movie. Well, just shows my age. 'Supers' or Superheroes are still outlawed in the world of 'Incredibles 2'. The movie literally opens where we left off 14 years ago as the Incredibles battle the Underminer determined to destroy the City. Emerging victorious the Family is forced back into seclusion. Brother and sister Winston and Evelyn of high-technology Dev Tech, voiced by slick Bob Odenkirk and sublime Catherine Keener, offer the Parr's their proposal. Winston and Evelyn seek to overturn the ban on Supers. Their late Father was the Supers greatest advocate. Both parents were tragically murdered when Supers were unable to save them from a home robbery. Marketing expert Winston wants to leverage Elastic Girl in the TV PR campaign to overturn the law. It's kind of like Reality TV for the good cause. Well, kind of. Swallowing his ego, because they opted out Mr. Incredible, Bob agrees that Helen should be the Star. Near half-way through the movie you get the telegraph that all is not what it seems. Perhaps, that's the only downside of Writer Bird's incredible narrative. Director Bird does provide the brilliant upside in the return of diminutive Supers costume designer extraordinaire Edna Mode or E. E graciously babysits and costumes Jack-Jack leashing and tracking some of his emergent powers. Bird is genuinely hysterical voicing E. And 'Incredibles 2' is absolutely hysterical with endearing sweetness.At times action movie overload occurs, particularly near the end. The amazing CGI tends to overwhelm a bit. Yet, when Helen tells her children how proud she is of them that resonates home. Because when it comes down to it: Love makes you Super. I just hope Bird, Disney and Pixar don't wait another 14 years to tell another 'Incredibles' story about love and family.",10,4,11,18 June 2018
Sin City," Sin-fully Good
","Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's 'Sin City' is a stunning visual experience with an inventive narrative style. It is unlike any movie seen before. Along with Guest Director Quentin Tarantino, 'Sin City' tells it's tale of deceit and vengeance through three interwoven stories. Based on his graphic novels, Frank Miller stylishly narrates the three stories through the voices of three of it's main characters. In a sense 'Sin City' is completely style driven, which is strangely enrolling. There are strong performances particularly from Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis, and Jessica Alba. The women in 'Sin City' are stunningly gorgeous. Jessica Alba is hot as the stripper, Nancy. Carla Gugino as the parole officer, Lucille, who naked throughout is totally hot. She is also good in the role. Rosario Dawson is strong and sexy as the prostitute leader, Gail.The most captivating story follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), who is this brutish giant with super human strength, and resilience. Marv is tracking down the murderer of hooker, Goldie (Jaime King). Goldie shared the night with monster-like Marv, but was brutally murdered while he was asleep. Marv follows the murder trail along with his parole officer, Lucille (Gugino), which uncovers a gruesome conspiracy at the city's highest levels. This is Rourke's best performance in years. As Marv he is a merciless killer, who he tempers as a noble beast. Rourke's Marv is on the verge of insanity, and has a sense of humor.Bruce Willis is good as Det. Hartigan, who saves 11 year-old Nancy from Rourke Jr. (Nick Stahl). Rourke Jr. is the son of a Senator. Hartigan saves Nancy, and horribly cripples Rourke Jr. However, in another conspiracy Haritgan is left near death and is prisoned for the 'assault' on little Nancy. Hartigan takes the fall to protect Nancy. She writes to Hartigan while he is imprisoned which keeps him alive. Through a chain of events Hartigan is released 8 years later, and attempts to locate Nancy. He soon realizes this was a set up. Willis is solid as Harigan. Jessica Alba as the grown Nancy has the right combination of smarts and vulnerability. She is just beautiful.The least interesting, though still a good story, involves another guy with super powers, Dwight (a darkly charismatic Clive Owen). In yet another conspiracy, Dwight comes to the aid of former flame Gail (Rosario Dawson) and her call girls, who are caught between dirty cops and the mob. Thinking about it, this story makes the least amount of sense, but is it comical for the gore and skimpy wardrobe. So this ends up being a good thing. A stand out is Devon Aoki as the samurai hooker, Miho. She dispatches her enemies with extreme prejudice and grace.'Sin City' also makes effective use of Taratino's juxtaposed narrative technique. It is amazing the narration feels seamless throughout. In the end, Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez prove that all resistance to style is futile. 'Sin City' is an original experience.",9,0,0,16 April 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," It's About the Girl
","Young Jamal (Dev Patel) is a contestant on the verge of winning 20 million rupees on the Indian version of 'Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?' How it is it possible that orphaned 'slumdog' Jamal can answer all the questions so far, when so many others have failed? Sergeant Srinivas (stalwart Saurabh Shukla) would also like to know, in his interrogation of suspected cheat Jamal. I had heard about much of the storyline of Director Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' prior to finally seeing it. The 'Millionaire' game show plot device initially on the surface seems contrived, as a way for Writer Simon Beaufoy to explore the story of Jamal through a series of riveting and captivating flashbacks.However, about half an hour through the movie I got it: 'It's about the girl.' Perhaps, midway through, there is a scene of movie magic where direction, story, and performance culminate together. Jamal waits for the love of his life Latika (stunningly beautiful Freida Pinto) at the train station. Jamal is distraught thinking Latika has dismissed him. Suddenly, she arrives. She looks up and sees Jamal, and lets out a smile. Not a word is spoken. It's about the girl.'Slumdog Millionaire' is a timeless love story, and the best movie of the year. 'Slumdog Millionaire' follows the story of Jamal, Latika, and Jamal's older brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) from the time they were orphaned children to now. Theirs is a story of tragedy, innocence lost, courage, and love. Danny Boyle is the mesmerizing and poignant storyteller. Simon Beaufoy's screenplay based on the novel 'Q & A' by Vikas Swarup is beautiful and touching. All the actors, who play the lead characters at various stages of their lives, are amazing and authentic. Boyle generates the enrolling spirit throughout 'Slumdog Millionaire'-- the story he tells is passionate and inspiring.Jamal and Salim become orphans as children following a Muslim massacre. They befriend orphaned Latika. Latika is destined to become the love of Jamal's life. They are all taken in by a ruthless group that enslaves children as beggars. Jamal and Salim manage to escape, but lose Latika. Years later Jamal and Salim rescue Latika, but at the cost of Salim's very soul. Salim chooses the dark path, one from which he can not return. Jamal is really now alone. His redemption may lie in 'Millionaire', but not for the obvious reasons. His is for love and for Latika.Eventually, Jamal reunites with Salim and grown up Latika. Life has not turned out as all had envisioned. At the story arc Jamal confesses to Latika, 'I love you.' She replies, 'It's too late.' She implores Jamal, 'Forget me.' Dev Patel and Freida Pinto are amazing, and the heart and soul of 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Yes, it's about the girl. More to the point: it's about the power of the human spirit, and love. There is tremendous pain and suffering, and at the same time deep compassion, selfless sacrifice, and redemption. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a very special movie.",10,10,17,9 February 2009
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," The Needs of the Many...
","In the climactic battle, clashing metal against metal, the voice of Leonard Nimoy says, 'The needs of the many always outweigh the needs of the few.' No, this is no remake of 'The Wrath of Khan'. Nimoy voices the duplicitous ancient Autobot leader Sentinel Prime, in Director Michael Bay's visually spectacular 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon'. This is the first 'Transformers' movie for me. I could not get through the first 'Transformers' on DVD, and passed on 'Revenge of the Fallen'. Michael Bay gets the job done in 'Transformers 3'—impeccable action set at hyperkinetic pace. Bay bludgeons sensory overload as his narrative style—and it works for him. We hardly notice the 2 hours and 37 minutes. Neither do we notice the absence of Meg Fox, who lost her invite. Victoria Secret model stunning Rosie Huntington-Whiteley assumes her place as Shia LaBeouf's Sam's girlfriend. Huntington-Whiteley is hotter. We see her Carly introduced as she walks in wearing Sam's shirt and a thong. This punctuated my error in not going with the 3D option.Bay filmed 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' in digital 3D. No post-production afterthought. The movie looks awesome. The visuals are breathtaking. Bay creates a swirling visual mural as Decepticon drones and airships float above a devastated Chicago. In a very cool aerial sequence, Lt. Col. Lennox (solid Josh Duhamel) and his Special Forces Team dart through the Chicago skyline in their glider jumpsuits. The climactic battle between Optimus Prime (noble Peter Cullen) and his betrayed mentor is a live action samurai anime spectacle. As imposing gleaming gladiators, the Autobots and Decepticons move as graceful warriors. Bay brings back action old school. As a director he is the masterful technician—the human elements are not his strong suit. Then again human drama is not the deal with 'Transformers 3'.The story by Ehren Kruger is surprisingly engrossing, albeit flimsy. Like 'X-Men: First Class' Kruger's tale is convincing revisionist conspiracy of the 1960's. Context: The Autobots and Decepticons are sentient robots, who are mortal enemies. Nearing Autobots demise at the hands of the Decepticons on home world Cybertron, Autobot leader Sentinel Prime (Nimoy) escapes in a ship called the Ark carrying the technology that could vanquish the Decepticons. With his mission thwarted, the Ark and Sentinel Prime crash on the Dark Side of the Moon. Detected in 1961, the Kennedy Administration declares the Space Race which was really a covert government operation to retrieve possible alien technology from the Moon. In 1969 the moon mission accomplished the intended goal. Now present day, Sec Def Mearing (callous and commanding Francis McDormand) is well aware of that NASA mission, and the presence of her peacekeeper Transformers under her watch. Turns out in this 50 year conspiracy, the Decepticons too have their human allies.Shia LaBeouf is convincingly frustrated and funny as Sam Witwicky, and rightly so. As Sam he had saved the world from the Decepticons, and received the Medal of Honor from President Obama, all on the down low. So this Ivy League graduate and Earth's savior struggles to find a job. In the meantime he is living with his super hot girl friend Carly (Huntington-Whiteley). Carly works for charming and arrogant accounting magnate Dylan (slickly menacing Patrick Dempsey), whose intentions are opaque. Sam manages to get a menial job at high tech government contractor working for eccentric John Malkovich as Bruce Brasos.While this transpires, Josh Duhamel's intense fearless Lennox leads his Special Forces team to investigate transient readings from Chernobyl in the Ukraine. This unveils the global Decepticon threat, and the reemergence of leader Megatron (reliably evil Hugo Weaving).So the narrative mechanics are poised to intersect, which is really Bay's excuse to blow crap up with amazing style. Bay brilliantly plays to his strong suit. In the midst of all the stunning visuals and breastbone vibrating explosions, the acting leads are solid. LaBeouf performs dependably as his subdued Sam transforms into the hero with vulnerability and a sense of humor. Too bad Duhamel isn't asked to do more. He is leading man handsome, charismatic, and brilliantly underplays the thoughtful hero. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is beautiful, which seems to be the leverage point of Carly. She does so with unaffected presence, and touch of humor. Dempsey plays in position. Tyrese Gibson, relegated to second string, is always cool. Gibson may be the smartest and luckiest actor in Hollywood next to Robert Downey Jr., being in two mega franchise movies—the other being 'Fast Five'.Bottom line: 'Transformers: Dark of the Moon' is a great summer movie. You shall be entertained.",8,1,5,8 July 2011
The Social Network," It's About the Girl
","Ironically, Facebook is all about the girl. In the opening of Director David Fincher's 'The Social Network', Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) gets dumped by his girlfriend BU student Erica Albright (strong and spirited Rooney Mara), and rightfully so. Erica tells Mark that he may rationalize that he is getting dumped, because he is a geek. No—'It'll be because you're an a—hole.' Outraged, Mark bashes Erica on his blog, and exacts his anger in the form of Facemash—where Harvard students get to rate the hotness of coeds. So the inception of Facebook was about Mark using his powers for evil, not good. Aaron Sorkin ('The West Wing') brilliantly tells the story of the rise of Facebook and billionaire Mark Zuckerberg based on Ben Mezrich's 'The Accidental Billionaires'. Granted his screenplay is part urban legend, and part real life drama about the social network Facebook which has 500 million members. Zuckerberg has altered the world.In the eyes and ears of Fincher and Sorkin is the great paradox: The creator of The Social Network is an alienated genius, predominately by his own doing. Jesse Eisenberg deftly borders sympathetic misunderstood genius and world class a—hole. It may be safe to surmise that the real Zuckerberg lies somewhere between the extremes—or perhaps not. 'The Social Network' is one the best movies of the year. Whether 'The Social Network' defines a generation? Only time will tell. 'The Social Network' plays like Internet tragedy. An ingenious idea captures the social consciousness, and culminates in a multimillion dollar lawsuit, pitting former friends against each other. At the catharsis, Mark's attorney Marylin Delphy (compassionate and smart Rashida Jones) tells him, 'You're not an a—hole. You just try so hard to be one.' Thomas Hardy said character is fate. Mark attained unimaginable wealth and success. No doubt he has an amazing life. In the final scene Fincher poignantly makes us wonder: Is Mark really happy and complete? Because Fincher and Sorkin make us care about this boy genius, who would be king.'The Social Network' is a warped rites of passage tale filled with deception and fascinating archetypes. Mark (Eisenberg) goes into business with his loyal roommate Eduardo Saverin (brilliant and earnest Andrew Garfield), who actually finances Mark's brain child. Mark's Facemash attracts the attention of the Winklevoss Twins, Cameron and Tyler (both played by Armie Hammer), who are blond, blue eyed, blue blood scholar athletes. Cameron and Tyler enlist Mark to develop their idea for a Harvard based on-line social network. Enter the seductive Sean Parker (amazing Justin Timberlake), co-founder of Napster and the dark force that discerns Facebook as the next big thing. Unlike Mark's other colleagues, Sean gets that what makes Facebook work is that it is cool. Timberlake is charismatic and dangerous—he is becoming a powerful actor. Sean wins over Mark with flash, money, and women. He tells Mark, 'This is our time!' Friendships end and unholy alliances form, and in the end—betrayal.So the world may have been a lot different if Mark actually apologized to Erica. Then again, character is fate. 'The Social Network' is awesome and on some level very sad. Sometimes the very genius that triumphs may ultimately be a curse. 'The Social Network' asks the poignant question: Was it worth it? On the surface this is a no brainer, and we all have to live with our choices and the aftermath.",10,1,2,10 October 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne Redemption
","'The Bourne Supremacy' is perhaps the best spy thriller in the past few years. Matt Damon as 'dormant' CIA assassin, Jason Bourne, is the tormented hero forced back into the spy game when the stakes become personal. Director Paul Greengrass provides expert pace, intrigue, and intelligence to the movie. Although his visual style of quick cuts, particularly in action sequences is bewildering. More on that later. Matt Damon is a movie star. As Jason Bourne he brings tremendous intensity balanced with the disturbing calm of master assassin. Along with Greengrass, acknowledge the Tony Gilroy screenplay based on the novel by Robert Ludlum. 'Supremacy' also has an excellent cast including the very strong and smart Joan Allen as Pamela Landy, CIA operations director, the subdued evil of Brian Cox as Ward Abbott (Landy's predecessor), and the solid Julia Stiles returning as Nicky, the voice of conscience. 'Supremacy' has an edge-- it is uncompromising. Jason Bourne wants to find some measure of peace in self-imposed exile in a remote town in India with the love of his life, Marie (the beautiful Franka Potente). However, he is haunted by patch memories of past missions. He was a programmed killer, and some of his targets were not necessarily the 'bad guys'. Greengrass and Gilroy unravel the story where their hero takes responsibility for both his actions and the aftermath, and accepts that he will not be forgiven. The story is rather intricate, and my mind is rather simple. Consequently, this does not give anything away. Fortunately, the plotting is straight forward. So here goes. An assignment to recover CIA files under the watch of Landy (Allen) goes amok, and agents are murdered. This debacle is framed on Bourne, who is residing in the Indian town. To complete the conspiracy, a former KGB operative (the dark and charismatic Karl Urban) is sent to kill Bourne (Damon). He fails; however, it results in a personal tragedy for Bourne. Thus, Bourne is forced back into the game seeking retribution. This is a welcome twist from 'The Bourne Identity': Jason Bourne is now choosing his targets. He tells Landy, 'I will bring this war to your doorstep...' Much of the satisfaction in watching 'Supremacy' is that his adversaries underestimate Bourne's prowess, and think they are 'badder' than he is. They are educated accordingly. In this way Joan Allen is effective as Pam Landy, who grows to respect Jason Bourne as the best. Period. Acknowledge Matt Damon. His Bourne is a tortured, explosive, smart, and totally empathetic hero. Damon has a powerful and quiet presence. He got in great shape and conditioning to play the role. His martial arts fighting sequences are excellent... when you can see them. This is one of things that could have been better in the movie. Greengrass's quick cut, music video style editing does not do justice to the fight scenes. The choreography looks sharp, but one can't really tell. This is really a personal bias. As a martial artist, I was interested in seeing the details of the cool knife fight sequence. Regardless, one can tell that Damon trained very hard for the fight sequences. Greengrass's style did however, make the final car chase scene the most captivating in recent movie memory. It is amazing. 'The Bourne Supremacy' is an intense, uncompromising spy thriller with strong performances. Matt Damon is awesome as Jason Bourne.",9,3,4,6 August 2004
The Proposal," Awesome 'Proposal'
","First off, Sandra Bullock is so hot nearly naked in 'The Proposal'. Her romantic lead Ryan Reynolds is completely ripped, seeing his shredded body is depressing. The two literally collide naked in a hysterical scene. Reynolds's Andrew screams, 'Oh my G**!' Bullock's Margaret screams, 'Why are you naked?' Andrew yells, 'Why are you wet?' Director Anne Fletcher's 'The Proposal' is the best romantic comedy of the year, by far. 'The Proposal' brilliantly written by Peter Chiarelli is a cross between 'The Devil Wears Prada' and Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew'. 'The Proposal' is formula; however, Fletcher and Chiarelli deliver flawlessly on point.Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have such amazing chemistry. I am such a fan of Bullock. She is beautiful, and masterfully transitions between comedic and poignant. There is a touching scene following Gammie's (wonderful Betty White) 'Easter egg' hunt for Margaret's (Bullock) boobs in a wedding gown fitting. Gammie gives Margaret the family keepsake that has been in the Paxton family for generations. She tells Margaret that grandmothers want to feel like they will be part of their grandchildren's lives after they are gone. Bullock silently stares into the mirror as her eyes well up. I too welled. After Margaret shares with Andrew (Reynolds) the significance of her tattoo, Andrew, who is sleeping on their bedroom floor says, 'Don't take this the wrong way. You are a very, very beautiful woman.' Reynolds is the new George Clooney. He is handsome, charming, and can deliver a line. Reynolds is going to be a huge star. He has the action star body, but his real gift is romantic comedy. Reynolds has great spirit. He and Bullock are awesome together. Whether Bullock hilariously reminds him, 'Touch my ass one more time, and I'll cut your nuts off in your sleep.' or when Reynolds quietly comforts Bullock in the boat, they land as real and authentic. 'The Proposal' is hysterical and predictable, yet unexpectedly poignant-- celebrating the best in people.In 'The Proposal' Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, high powered Type A and Editor-in-Chief of a New York Publisher. Scattered and smart Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton, her suffering and loyal executive assistant. Margaret asks if Andrew's family is telling him to quit his job. Andrew replies, 'Every day.' The Chairman Bergen (solid Michael Nori) informs Margaret that she is being deported—back to Canada. When Andrew interrupts the meeting, Margaret derives a solution. She informs Bergen, 'We're, ah getting married.' Stunned Andrew replies, ' We are.' However, Andrew now realizes that Margaret is beholding to him. The conspiracy is risky. Intrepid Immigration Agent (brilliantly stiff Denis O'Hare) warns the happy couple that if he uncovers fraud, Margaret will be deported and Andrew will go to jail for years.So in the mean time, Margaret and Andrew travel back to his hometown of Sitka, Alaska to attend the 90th Birthday of his grandmother Gammie (Betty White), and announce their engagement. Margaret discovers that Andrew's family are the Kennedy's of Alaska. Andrew has not been home in 3 years, because his father Joe (great Craig T. Nelson) wants him to take over the family business, and stop messing around in New York. Andrew's passion is becoming an editor, and paradoxically his bond to Margaret despite the surface disdain. Mary Steenburgen is amazing as Andrew's mother Grace, who is the strong and understated peacemaker. She has a powerful scene where she tells Joe to clean it up with Andrew. Margaret also meets Gertrude (charming and pretty Malin Akerman), Andrew's ex-girlfriend. Margaret witnesses Andrew's life and dreams.Can Andrew and Margaret pull off the charade, and the family induced wedding? Of course high jinx ensue. Margaret has her Blackberry high jacked by an eagle, and survives Sitka's only exotic male dancer (hysterical Oscar Nunez). Andrew stresses out that his Mom's dreams will be dashed when she discovers fraud. Here Fletcher balances humanity at the narrative arc. Margaret breaks down realizing her selfishness when she tells Andrew, 'I forgot what it was like to have a family Have people love you' We kind of know how things will resolve in the 'The Proposal', but that is never really the point. It is the things unsaid, like the look in Andrew's eyes when he realizes that he is in love with Margaret, that touch us. 'The Proposal' is hysterical, smart, and all about love and heart.",10,5,18,21 June 2009
Sully," 'Sully' does its best
","In 'Sully' the white haired and mustached Tom Hanks as Sully wearily tells his wife played by Laura Linney on the phone, '... I did the best I could.' His wife knows he did. We do as well. On January 15, 2009 Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger landed the crippled US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew. Director Clint Eastwood tells the hero's story in 'Sully', one of his best movies. Eastwood's direction and Tom Hanks as Sully are stark and powerful in understatement. They honor all the heroes of the US Airways Flight. 'Sully' is lean, clean, and inspiringâ€”much like Eastwood. The conflict in 'Sully' centers upon the investigation of whether Sully made the right choice. Hanks's authenticity and humility evoke Sully's strength and compassion. He reminds us that Sully did his best, and he got it right. 'Sully' is one of the best movies of the year. 'Sully' follows the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the airplane landing on the Hudson River. Todd Komarnicki's screenplay based on the book by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow seamlessly intertwines flashbacks from the water landing, and the NTSB proceedings. Eastwood effortlessly orchestrates the narrative of the startling images of the landing and the irony of the investigation. The visual effects of the plane landing on the Hudson are spectacular. Cinematographer Tom Stern captures the impact on a very personal scale. Water flooding the cabin. Sully and crew racing into action getting the passengers to safety. We see the fear in everyone's face, and the courage to get through. We are in awe. Eastwood and Komarnicki graciously acknowledge the community of heroes: from the ferry boat crew at the scene, the Coast Guard divers, to all the first responders and the police. And it starts with Sully. He has his anchors of support. Aaron Eckhart is loyal and solid as First Officer Jeff Skiles. He was his invaluable right hand during the unthinkable, and during the investigation. Just minutes into the flight, birds collide with the plane's engines. Sully notices that they lost thrust in both engines, forcing them to choose an emergency landing. Eckhart is smart and subtle in his unwavering support of Hank's Sully through it all. Laura Linney amazes as Sully's wife Lorraine, his emotional rock. Sully has his doubts, and she is always there for him. Linney is relegated by the story to phone conversations with Sully. She beautifully accentuates that what Sully does sources from their profound relationship. That also goes for Eckhart. They all see the best in each other. At the story arc Hanks as Sully graciously acknowledges all the heroes involved. We are also present to that he is catalyst for heroes emerging. Everyone involved was grateful to Sully. Eastwood is succinct in the irony of it all. Sully did his best, and saved 155 people. The NTSB scrutinized whether there were other viable alternatives. What Sully did worked in an unprecedented crisis. Period.The music in 'Sully' both eloquently highlights and undercuts the range of emotions. Christian Jacob and the Tierney Sutton Band composed the score from Clint Eastwood's musical theme. The music's clarity and simplicity embody the movie's quiet heroism.'Sully' is beautiful simplicity and power. Eastwood and Hanks celebrate people selflessly doing their best to make a difference. One of the measures of a hero is that he or she acknowledges and inspires other heroes. 'Sully' does all that and more. It is one of the best movies of the year.",10,9,15,16 September 2016
Cinderella Man," Heart of a Champion
","Director Ron Howard's 'Cinderella Man' was not what I was expecting. It is a touching love story, and a story of great character. It is the best movie of the year so far. Yes, is not just a movie about boxing. It is Ron Howard's best movie-- so moving and inspiring. Russell Crowe as Depression Era Heavyweight contender, James J. Braddock, is so powerful, compassionate, and inspiring. Though sometimes it takes a little to reconcile, Crowe's screen persona from his media celebrity, I think Crowe truly distinguishes himself as the movies' most powerful actor with almost limitless range. He is awesome in 'Cinderella Man', and he may win another Oscar.I was familiar with Jim Braddock in the context of Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (played in the movie by Craig Bierko). Jim Braddock would become Heavyweight Champion by upsetting the arrogant Max Baer. I had read accounts for the accuracy in 'Cinderella Man' depicting Baer as a smug, arrogant, partier. Baer even took pride in the fact that he killed 2 boxers in the ring. As excellently played by Bierko, Baer is basically a big bully, who thinks he can have his way, because he is stronger than everyone. But ultimately he is short on heart, and void of any character.Jim Braddock (Crowe) went down a different path, the fate of the Great Depression, and thus, his transformation was entirely distinct. In 1925 Jim was a number one Light Heavyweight contender managed by Joe Gould (the amazing Paul Giamatti). Jim had a lovely home with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger), and their 3 children: Jay (Connor Price), Howard (Patrick Louis), and Rosie (scene stealer Ariel Waller). Jim and Mae were so in love, and it is clear from the beginning that their relationship is a source of strength and courage. During the Depression the Braddocks are reduced to poverty, living in a run down apartment. Jim works at the docks, and takes fights for chump change. A series of events causes Jim to leave boxing, and the proud Jim vows to keep his family together. This is where the screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsmith (based on the story by Hollingsworth) transcends to a moving tale of love and family. There is a heart-wrenching scene where Jim (Crowe) asks for money from his former promoters so he can pay for the electricity for his family, saying to Joe Gould, 'I'm sorry...' Through luck and accident Jim gets another shot back in boxing due to Joe. This time it is different. Jim eventually gets a shot at the World Title held by Max Baer. Even one the fighters Jim beats this time around says, 'He's not the same guy.' During a press conference prior to the Title Fight, when asked what was different this time around, Jim says he fights for 'milk'-- recalling a scene with his daughter Rosie. Ron Howard along with his writers Hollingsworth and Goldsmith are such compelling and moving storytellers. An amazingly strong and understated Renee Zellweger as Mae is terrified for her husband Jim who is fighting a giant who may literally kill her husband before the fight tells Jim, 'You are the champion of my heart.' That stopped me in my tracks. 'Cinderella Man' is all heart, and is a movie that truly inspires us all. It is an amazing movie about character and ultimately the inherent greatness in us all.This is Russell Crowe's best performance to date. His power is tempered with great compassion and such a delicate tenderness. Renee Zellweger is a rock. Her performance is dead on for authenticity, and her understated strength is a joy to watch. Paul Giamatti is such a talented actor. He brings a lightness and humanity to 'Cinderella Man'. Director Howard direction is so natural and the performances of his actors are truly awesome. 'Cinderella Man' may be the best movie of the year. It is a great movie about greatness. Now this is something we can all celebrate.",10,4,8,12 June 2005
The Soloist," 'The Soloist' Will Carry You Home
","Robert Downey Jr. is amazing in Joe Wright's 'The Soloist'. Downey is powerful, and embodies such humanity and compassion. His performance is never self-conscious, all about the character and the story. There is a quiet scene where Downey's Steve Lopez confesses to his ex-wife Mary (wonderful Catherine Keener) about Nathaniel Ayers (Jamie Foxx), 'He's got a gift' But Steve is at the breaking point in his efforts in helping the disturbed former child protégée. Keener consoles, 'You are not going to cure him All you can do is be his friend.' 'The Soloist' is brilliant in its catharsis and simplicity. Director Joe Wright ('Atonement') literally orchestrates powerful and touching performances from Downey and Foxx. Screenwriter Susannah Grant does a virtuoso translation of Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez's book. I loved 'The Soloist'. 'The Soloist' is so compelling in its humanity.Based on a true story, 'The Soloist' tells the story of Steve's (Downey) friendship with Nathaniel (Foxx). By accident L.A. Times writer Steve Lopez meets Nathaniel Ayers on his lunch break in the park. The homeless Nathaniel is playing Beethoven on his two string violin. Nathaniel admits to Steve, 'I've had a few set backs.' Steve sees a potential story in this—for him. After initial research, Steve discovers that Nathaniel was a student at Julliard, who mysteriously dropped out in 1970. Through Grant's narrative we learn that the musical genius Nathaniel may have battled schizophrenia since childhood.'The Soloist' follows Steve's journey to salvage Nathaniel's life. Wright and Grant also make us aware of the plight of the homeless in Los Angeles, and the efforts of such noble causes as LAMP. They also provide insight into the pain and suffering of the mentally ill and challenged. To that end Jaime Foxx is defined authenticity. As Nathaniel, Foxx brilliantly stays the course, because his character will not change. That transformation is left to Downey's Steve, who must deliver on their partnership. Downey astounds. He is so believable and compelling as the good and decent man doing his best, and at a loss as to what to do. At one story arc, Nathaniel tells Steve, 'I love you.' That is not what Steve wanted to hear, because now he is responsible for another. He confesses to the LAMP director, 'I don't want to be his only thing!' The most astounding thing about Downey's compassionate performance is displayed when he is listening and in his silence. There is a breathtaking scene where Steve gives Nathaniel a cello, and eyes widen as he listens to Nathaniel play. He and Foxx have a touching screen partnership. I was in awe in a scene where Downey and Foxx sit together and listen to a Los Angeles Symphony rehearsal at the Disney Concert Hall.'The Soloist' at times is off paced and is distracted by some narrative turns. However, it has great heart. Jaime Foxx is compelling and true. Robert Downey Jr. is electrifying. This is truly his movie—he is awesome. In the words of Downey's Steve, 'Being his friend will carry you home.' See 'The Soloist', and allow yourself to be moved.",10,26,34,26 April 2009
Dodgeball," Funny on the Fringe
","Making, much less seeing 'Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' is bizarre, beyond the fringe of the most remote element in popular culture. The fact that the movie title includes a clarification that distinguishes it from perhaps the 'other' Dodgeball movie is both ridiculous and unsettling. That being said, Writer and Director Rawson Marshall Thurber's 'Dodgeball' is very stupid, and extremely funny. Vince Vaughn as Average Joe's Gym owner, Peter La Fleur, emerges as today's most talented comic straight man. This year Vaughn has appeared in smaller comic roles in such movies as 'Starsky and Hutch' and 'Anchorman'. Vaughn has a cool and ease about him, always playing insightful in the midst of brain dead chaos. Dodgeball's world class stupidity is embodied in Peter's crew. Its paragon of stupid is White Goodman, owner of the rival Globo Gym. As played by Ben Stiller, White Goodman is dumber than a post. On a certain level, one has to admire Stiller's bold performance which is so over the top, that you can virtually hear the brain cells dying in White Goodman's head. Not only is White beyond the realm of stupid, he is also arrogant and completely self-absorbed. Yes, he is perhaps the most annoyingly funny character in all of movie-dom. In a clueless White attempt to seduce, Kate Veatch (cute and smart Christine Taylor), he asks her if she is okay. She responds, 'I just threw up in my mouth... a little.' Whoa. Kate is the bank auditor assigned to review Average Joe's Gym's financials. The gym is in foreclosure. White makes a hostile takeover attempt for Average Joe's, and for Kate. Kate, however is sympathetic to Peter, though everyone in Average Joe's think she is a lesbian. Go figure. Where White's Globo Gym is for the 'beautiful' people, Peter's Average Joe's Gym is not. Not at all. Peter asks high school member Justin (charming and geeky Justin Long), 'Wait, so you want to join the cheer leading squad so people don't think you're a loser?' Peter's members are not an athletically inspired group. Okay, they are a bunch of pathetic losers-- athletically and socially. It is so absurd, that one of the guys thinks he's a pirate which goes unnoticed by most of the group. Peter must raise $50,000 or lose his gym to foreclosure, and eventually to Globo Gym. Fortunately, one of the guys, Gordon (very funny Stephen Root from 'Office Space'), discovers in his issue of 'Obscure Sports Journal' that they could earn the money by winning the Dodgeball Tournament in Las Vegas. After gaining a tournament seeding following a scandalous Girl Scouts match, the boys enroll legendary Dodgeball coach Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn). Patches is apparently this Dodgeball Yoda in a wheelchair, uttering such sage advice as 'If you can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a ball.' Kate (Taylor) demonstrates a special talent, and joins the team in their quest for Dodgeball glory. My only familiarity with Dodgeball: The Game was as a grade schooler during recess and P.E. Then I saw Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn promoting 'Dodgeball' on MTV providing color commentary at a Dodgeball Tournament. I was unaware of this whole sports culture. So when Thurber adds the winning combination of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman as Dodgeball color commentators, Cotton McKnight and Pepper Brooks, on ESPN8 (the Ocho) the effect is no longer absurd. It becomes surreal. 'Dodgeball' unexpectedly has the most funny inspiring speech I can remember from a movie. At the emotional arc of the movie, Lance Armstrong playing himself shares with Peter (Vaughn) that being diagnosed with brain, lung and testicular cancer drove him to win 5 Tour de Frances (at that time). He then asks Peter, 'So what are you dying of...?' Classic. Then again Thurber's 'Dodgeball' is full of surprises. The biggest one is that this stupid story is truly funny, for the most part clever, and has a unique charm. Even amidst the sometimes bottom of the barrel scraping humor, the movie has a genuine fondness for it's cast of lovable losers. We all pull for Peter and his team to reclaim the greatness deep inside themselves... buried very, very deep inside.",8,0,0,12 August 2004
The Fighter," Inspiring Redemption
","Sitting in his corner catching his breath after enduring a beating in the Championship fight, Mark Wahlberg's Mickey Ward is consoled by his estranged brother Dickie Eklund, played by Christian Bale. Bale bows his brow against Wahlberg's, and says, 'This is your time' Director David O. Russell's 'The Fighter' is the inspiring true story of redemption. Christian Bale is powerful and nearly unrecognizable. He will win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He is awesome, and his visceral chemistry with Wahlberg distinguishes 'The Fighter'.The screenplay and story by Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, Eric Johnson, and Keith Dorrington recounts the true story of Welterweight boxer Mickey Ward during his rise to champion, prior to his legendary fights with Arturo Gaetti. Ward was one of the toughest fighters ever, with strong jaw, tremendous heart, and furious punches. Mark Wahlberg trained intensely, and looks amazing as a boxer. He captures Ward's rock steady toughness and angst as he contends with his smothering family. Bale is electrifying as his junkie trainer brother Dickie. In his prime Dickie Eklund stood toe-to-toe with Sugar Ray Leonard for 10 rounds, and knocking him down. Dickie is a crack head low-life, who along with their domineering Mom Alice (scary and controlling Melissa Leo) may be dragging Mickey down for the count.Bale is amazing. I hated him in the beginning of the movie, as he fleshes out the irresponsible loser Dickie. Bale is scarily gaunt and high strung lanky nerves. However, Bale reveals Dickie's boxing intellect. During a prison visit, Dickie asks Mickey, 'What is your plan?' for his next fight. Bale focuses and tells him exactly what to do. He reminds, 'I was talking about you.' Out of prison with his eyes hauntingly wide Dickie asks Mickey's girl friend Charlene (tough Amy Adams), 'So what have you done in your life?' As self aware that he is such a jerk, he realizes that his brother is in love. In a scene of rare movie magic, Wahlberg says to his brother in reference to the Ray Leonard fight, 'You were my hero' Bale with his back turned to the camera says, 'I was.' 'The Fighter' is about stepping up and being a hero, even in spite of one self.'The Fighter' works, because it is the story of redemption—for both Mickey and Dickie. Leo and Adams are absolutely strong as polarizing forces in Mickey's life. It is really Bale and Wahlberg's touching screen partnership that brings home 'The Fighter'. And this is balancing of styles and directing brilliance on Russell's part. Bale is raw powerful extremes. Wahlberg is unwavering and rock steady. 'The Fighter' makes you cheer for both. Everyone deserves a second chance, and the chance to be great. 'The Fighter' is very special and touching in that way.",10,2,3,31 December 2010
Up in the Air," Not Settling...
","In 'Up in the Air' George Clooney as corporate downsizing specialist Ryan Bingham asks laid off employee Bob (reliably great J.K. Simmons), 'Why do kids like professional athletes?' Indignant Bob replies it's because they get to have sex with Victoria Secret models. Ryan reminds him that is why 'we' like athletes. Ryan tells Bob, 'Kids like athletes, because they follow their dreams.' Ryan points out to Bob, that he sold out his dream of being a chef, to take his job. Now he has a chance to follow his dreams, and inspire his kids. Clooney is amazing. He possesses deadly deft charm that always underlies a sense of humanity. His Ryan Bingham is a self-sentenced loner in pursuit of the elite 10 million mile frequent flier status—more at home on the plane, than at home. Training in tow is idealistic Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), who envisions revolutionizing Ryan's business by terminating employees over the internet and teleconferencing. Thus, eliminating Ryan's need for travel and dashing his 10 million miles dreams. Solid Jason Bateman is boss Craig, who forces the road trip training jaunt.Anna Kendrick is awesome, and like Clooney is Oscar worthy. Her Natalie is exceedingly bright, void of experience, and strung way too tight. As she unravels Kendrick is funny, and very human. In a great scene Kendrick silently sits outside after she fires an employee that has unexpected consequences. Clooney walks over and consoles her, saying that it is their job to make the horrendous 'tolerable'. That compelling chemistry in concert with Writer/ Director Jason Reitman's ('Juno') narrative mastery make 'Up in the Air' one of the best movies of the year. Reitman with Sheldon Turner wrote the screenplay from the novel by Walter Kirn. Kirn's story has been updated to the current economic upheaval and the personal turmoil in the widespread unemployment in the U.S. Reitman filmed real people, who have been laid off and must contend with paying a mortgage and feeding their families. He never dismisses the gravity of it all. Reitman balances paradoxical humor and the tragedy and impact of being laid off. This is revealed in the narrative thread for Clooney's Ryan himself. Self exiled loner Ryan is captivated by fellow business traveler Alex (smart and smoldering Vera Farmiga). Alex reminds Ryan that she is like him only with a vagina. Ryan actually considers altering his status, also at the urging of Natalie, who points out that he is so full of it. He even asks Alex to come to his estranged niece's wedding in Omaha. Perhaps, there may be more to life than just flying solo? However, Ryan's karma may dictate a particular outcome. 'Up in the Air' concludes not perfunctorily, but eloquently. However, particularly with Ryan and Natalie it is about following your dreams in the context of them sometimes being dashed; rather it is just that life happens. Touching Farmiga's Alex tells Kendrick, after Natalie describes the man she wants to marry: it is not about settling. As one gets older, our dreams themselves evolve, and we all have to make peace with that. 'Up in the Air' really gets it right in one of the year's best movies.",10,0,5,13 December 2009
Atonement," No Atonement
","The first half of 'Atonement' is so deadly slow and dreary, in spite of the spectacular cinematography of Seamus McGarvey. However, the ending captivated and blew me away. Vanessa Redgrave surprises as an old Briony, now near the end of her days, talking about her latest and final novelan autobiographical story. She confesses, 'I don't expect to be forgiven.' The touching irony of Director Joe Wright's 'Atonement' is that it is not. Briony may have spent her entire adult life in penance for what she did when she was 13 years old, but ultimately she may not be forgiven. Director Wright and Screenwriter Tim Bevan (who adapted Ian McEwan's novel) tell a story of star-crossed love and profound sadness. I really liked 'Atonement' more than I thought I would. I truly admired the craft of the movie more than the touching tragedy. Personal preference aside, 'Atonement' is a great movie.It is 1935 England before World War II. We observe the world of upper middle class England. Precocious 13 year old Briony Tallis (Saoire Ronan) fancies herself a play writer. Her beautiful older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) battles her raging hormones. She has a physical attraction for Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the Tallis' maid. Robbie is the estate handyman. Briony too, has an unrequited crush on handsome Robbie. The Tallis' have house guests in the Quincey children, Lola (Juno Temple) and her brothers Jackson and Pierrot. Briony and Cecilia's older brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) returns home from school with his bud Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch)a creepy young chap.Briony spies Cecilia with Robbie in a compromising situation by the estate fountain. Robbie gives Briony an accidentally enclosed letter for Cecilia, which she secretly reads before giving to her sister. Robbie (McAvoy) and Cecilia (Knightley) engage in a totally steamy and erotic tryst in the family library, which Briony witnesses. Then during a family crisis, Briony (Ronan) perpetrates a lie that sends Robbie to prison, and Cecilia is irrevocably separated from her true love. Though only 13 years old, Briony does not realize that her lies may have destroyed true love and more importantly the lives of people she loves.Now 5 years later, Robbie is in France in the middle of World War II. Cecilia has left home and has become a nurse. 18 year old Briony (Romola Garai) has decided to leave Cambridge to become a nurse like her sister. This is her attempt to reconcile with Cecilia. What echoes throughout 'Atonement' is Knightley's plea to McAvoy's Robbie, 'Come back Come back to me.' 'Atonement' is punctuated by profound yearning of the heart, and resounding sadness. Keira Knightley is sexy, amazingly strong, and movingly vulnerable. James McAvoy is compelling and compassionate throughout. He embodies nobility in Robbie's suffering soul. The surprise is Romola Garai as the older Briony. She is amazing as Briony begins to realize the pain and suffering she caused by her lie years ago. Vanessa Redgrave is powerful and sad as the old Briony, spent by a life in penance.Joe Wright's 'Atonement' is touchingly sad. Life ends, and at best that life ends complete. However, we can not always expect to be forgiven for our misdeeds and unintended cruelties. So perhaps, the best we can do is be at peace with life being incomplete. There is no atonement in 'Atonement', and that may have been the point of Wright's passionately moving story.",10,1,3,16 February 2008
V for Vendetta," V not for Vision
","Homage to 17th century British anarchist Guy Fawkes is not the most obvious role model for the protagonist in 'V for Vendetta'. This is one of the surprising choices in Andy and Larry Wachowski's screenplay 'V for Vendetta'-- their much awaited motion picture project since the Matrix trilogy. This time around they delegated directing duties to James McTeiguean unfamiliar name. Set in future, perhaps 25 years or so, England is a fascist State lead by Dictator Adam Sutler (John Hurt). Apparently the result of world war and economic collapse, Sutler rules England through a futuristic Reign of Terror. 'V' ambitiously asks us to distinguish between nihilist, anarchist, and patriotwhich may really be a matter of point of view or locality. The Wachowski Brothers aim to make a movie about ideas and the notion that the lines between terrorism and patriotism are often blurred. However, this conceit is not entirely original. Philosopher Will Durant said of originality, 'Nothing is new except arrangement.' At best 'V' is a vengeance tale about a wronged man seeking to right a grave and personal injustice. It is an action movie of sorts that is spectacular to observe. Hugo Weaving plays the masked hero V, who like Fawkes plans on blowing up Parliament. V possesses great warrior prowess, strength, and reflexes which is explained through the narrative. V is also prone to quote Shakespeare. He is a tragic man who has suffered gravely, and has lost everything that he holds dear. He tells Evey (Natalie Portman), 'You wear the mask long enough; you forget who you were' Weaving does an admirable job given he is masked throughout the entire movie. There is great power and sadness in his words. However, 'V for Vendetta' falls short for its hero's compromise of his own humanity. Ultimately, V's quest for vengeance is sympathetic, but does not inspire. Redemption is lost even with Director McTeigue's grand finale.Natalie Portman plays Evey, who works at the government controlled Broadcast Network. V rescues Evey from would-be rapists in the dangerous London streets. Evey and V have a compelling affinity. Stephen Rea plays Finch the detective assigned to track down V, who uncovers the relationship between Evey and V. Conspiracy abounds in 'V for Vendetta'. Natalie Portman is very good as Evey. We learn that Evey's parents were political activists who met their demise. Portman is convincing as a young woman discovering her own greatness and power. Portman's Evey is the crucial humanizing aspect of Weaving's V. Though as written by the Wachowski Brothers this is woefully insufficient. Andy and Larry Wachowski should be allowed to coast on their 'Matrix' laurels. Like 'The Matrix' sequel misfires, 'V' sets a captivating premise-- in this case the nature of terrorism versus patriotism; however, the conclusion is unclear and not very satisfying. In the end 'V' is more sadly tragic, than classically heroic.",8,1,3,21 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," No Top
","With Will Ferrell there is no 'over the top', because for Ferrell there is no 'top'this is an acknowledgment of Farrell's unique talent and gifts. In 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' Will Farrell plays NASCAR champion Ricky Bobby whose credo is 'If you ain't first, you're last.' He and childhood bud Cal Naughton, Jr. (John C. Reily) dominate the NASCAR circuit as 'Shake' and 'Bake'. Two signature scenes illustrate the Will Ferrell experience. Following a traumatic crash and mental meltdown, Ricky is convinced he is paralyzed, when it is only in his 'head'. However, he screams to partner Cal (Reily) and pit manager Lucius (steady Michael Clarke Duncan), 'I am so paralyzed!' and stabs himself in his own thigh. Also on the road to regain his driving edge, Ricky's estranged father Reese Bobby (Gary Cole) tells his son, 'You have to learn to drive with the fear...'Reese makes Ricky drive with a live cougar. Both scenes had me laugh so hard, I was in tears. 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is funny and cleverly written by Ferrell and director Adam McKay. Ferrell and McKay nail the NASCAR culture in their satire, and 'Talladega Night' is funnier than its trailer.In 'Talladega Nights' Ricky and Cal rule NASCAR finishing first and second in their races (when Bobby doesn't crash). Cal always finishes second. Ricky has all the trappings of wealth and celebrity. He's got a mansion, luxury cars, his sons-- Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell), his 'Red-Hot Smokin' Wife' Carley (dead-on Leslie Bibb), and his loyal assistant Susan (funny Amy Adams). Ricky has a lot to be thankful for demonstrated in a hilarious dinner prayer scene. However, Ricky's world soon turns upside down with the arrival of French Formula One Champion Jean Girard (outrageous Sacha Baron Cohen of 'Ali G' fame), who has come to America not for Chinese food or pizza, but to beat Ricky Bobby on the NASCAR track. The gay Jean Girard loves jazz and reads Camusan obvious rival to our hero Ricky. The stage is set for stretching the bounds of Ricky's courage and character in his hysterical triumph over adversity. Basically, Ferrell has us laughing on the floor.Adam McKay has everyone play it straight in this merciless comedy. This is Will Ferrell territory. Ferrell brings an unbelievable authenticity to Ricky Bobby. Every character choice he makes is dead on, funny, and never falters into caricature. Ferrell is amazingly earnest and completely bold as 'the big hairy American Winning Machine'. Watching Ferrell running in his underpants thinking that he is on fire speaks for itself. John C. Reily is awesome as Cal, Ricky's loyal driving partner and life-long bud. Reily's Cal is truly a partner to Ricky, a good simple man seeking a measure of validation. Reily gives Cal an ease and clueless charm. Leslie Bibb is hot, and nails her role as Carley, the 'wife of a NASCAR driver'. Jane Lynch is rock solid and hilarious as Ricky's supportive mom Lucy. Amy Adams is wacky charming as the woman who inspires: 'Ricky Bobby is not a thinker. Ricky Bobby is a driver.' Sacha Baron Cohen's accent alone as Jean Girard merits a medal. In character as Girard he is completely out therein a great way. Gary Cole is truly awesome as Ricky's dad Reese. His Reese is comically self absorbed finally surrendering to his paternal instincts, well kind of. His driving scenes with Ferrell will become classic.Here is a curious aside: A number of critics point out that 'Talladega Nights' has the most product placement shots of any movie, ever. Well, being that this is a satire of NASCAR, what is their point? Ricky Bobby should wear a 'Funny' decal on his 'Wonder Bread' racing jump suit. Because that is what 'Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is. Will Ferrell as Ricky Bobby is the American Laughing Machine. Ferrell and McKay definitely get it right. A clever funny script. Exacting classic comedic performances. All this makes 'Talladega Nights' a winning time at the movies.",10,3,8,6 August 2006
Semi-Pro," Could have been...
","In the opening of Director Kent Alterman's 'Semi-Pro' Will Ferrell as 70's One Hit Wonder Jackie Moon provides his musical stylings of his song 'Do Me Sexy'. Will Ferrell sings his disco song straight up in character and is hysterical. Although given the promising start Alterman and Writer Scot Armstrong's movie really falls flat, despite some big laughs. I particularly cracked up at the halftime bit where Jackie dressed as 'Mr. Sun' and the rest of his Tropics teammates are dressed as sea creatures. Some of the supporting performances are pretty good including Woody Harrelson playing a quasi-realistic Monix and Andre Benjamin as Tropics leading scorer Clarence Black. Will Ferrell is at his best playing obtuse, lovable, and arrogant Jackie. However, the problem with 'Semi-Pro' over the long haul (all 90 minutes) is that it is not smart stupidit is stupid stupid. I was really a fan of 'Blades of Glory' and 'Talladega Nights'. 'Semi-Pro' is not nearly as funny as either. Understandably, if you are not a fan of Big Will, then disregard the previous, and pretty much most of this comment. The ending of 'Semi-Pro' is incongruously bittersweet. This seems so out of place. Then again, arguing for context in 'Semi-Pro' is futile.The premise of 'Semi-Pro' is actually funny. Realize I am referring to the premise, only. 70's disco star Jackie Moon (Ferrell) scores with his number one smash 'Do Me Sexy'. He parlays his new found wealth by buying ABA Basketball Teamthe Flint Tropics. This vanity project also includes Jackie being the Tropics Player-Coach. Having no basketball acumen as player or coach, the Tropics reign the cellar of the division. Then the ABA Commissioner (funny David Koechner) announces that 4 ABA teams would merge with the NBA. Unfortunately, that does not include the Tropics. However, natural promoter Jackie convinces the ABA Commission that the 4 teams with the best records should be allowed to merge. Still the Tropics are not among the top 4 teams, yet. In an edgy move Jackie trades the Team's ice machine for retired NBA player Monix (solid Woody Harrelson). Monix had won an NBA Championship with the Celtics, although he spent his time on the bench during the playoff run. Minor detail. All the narrative elements are poised. However, 'Semi-Pro' misfires on all cylinders. Granted there is a hilarious gag that runs a little long with Jackie wrestling a bear. One hysterical bit has Jackie conflicted as his Tropics lead an opponent; however, if they score more than 125 points, it's free corn dog night. And Jackie doesn't have the corn dogs.It's too bad that 'Semi-Pro' is not completely hysterical. Perhaps, the Will Ferrell sports' farces have run their course. Maybe next time Will fares better with X-Games or Extreme Fighting? Maybe.",7,15,29,2 March 2008
