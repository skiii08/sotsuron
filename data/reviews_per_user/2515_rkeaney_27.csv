Mission: Impossible III," Puts the previous two to shame
","Wow!!!!well what can i say how often do you see a trilogy of sequels where the third installment far outshines the previous two?The change of director has done wonders to this franchise.J.J.Abrams has taken a popular, albeit tired franchise and added an extra bit of spice to it which has made it into just an excellent action/thriller.The choice to cast Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the bad guy in this film was an excellent one his charisma and attitude has just made this movie what it is a very entertaining high octane filled movie.Along with the amazing special effects,adrenaline filled sequences , a vast improvement on Cruise's acting abilities,a more interesting plot and a convincing bad guy this movie has just put the previous two to shame.Bravo J.J.Abrams!!!7/10-just an excellently entertaining action/thriller,well worth a watch!",7,0,2,6 May 2006
Fight Club," My Review - Fight Club (1999)
","this movie is absolutely amazing!I mean seriously how many movies can u say that every time you watch it it gets better... The answer- a very small number...Fight Club is to me an amazing piece of cinema..The thing about truly great cinema as i have observed first hand by recommending this movie to friends and family members is that you will always get mixed reviews and maybe it will only be a small percentage sometimes.. but almost always a great movie will get through to someone..Fight Club for me is that type of movie...This is one of my all time favourites.I'm not going to divulge in to the whole plot of this movie as i believe it must be seen first hand to be truly appreciated.The Writing is superb as is the acting,also this movie contains one of the most thought provoking twists i have ever seen in a movie which i think is a key aspect to movie greatness.. something that will truly make u think and grasp your attention.The underlying theme of this movie i think will play a very strong role in making peoples decisions and opinions of this movie.As the underlying theme will clash with peoples morals,peoples way of life,and peoples basic opinions as human beings.No one can say that if someone told you that all of your material possessions were absolutely useless to you and u only need basic things to get real happiness out of life ,that you would agree 100% with them,there would always be a tiny thing that we love that we wouldn't , and couldn't cope with losing.. this movie brings the basic fear to life and shows us that we really don't need all these material objects..This , i think scares people..it scares people because a lot of people will not want to be influenced by a movie but some will embrace it and realise that its a movie with a very valid point. i am one of those people..Some people will not like this movie for very different reasons and some will love it for other reasons also.By No Means can i say that this is the greatest movie ever.. because you can draw different opinions and views of every movie for one reason or another.There is all types of great movies such as epic,comedy,romance etc... but movies like these are also in that category movies such as Fight club,American Beauty,etc..If You haven't already i urge you to go and see this great movie hopefully like me you will not be disappointed ..10/10-Amazing!!",10,1,3,11 November 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Just Magical ! - An Excellent Rendition Of The Novel
","I have got to say that this movie is very enjoyable.As a child i had watched the VHS version made in the 80's and the animated feature but without the excellent special effects they are just mediocre compared to this.The battle scene is phenomenal and it is just an excellent rendition of the novel.We start in London in the height of the blitz which i'm happy to see they added in.The four children are sent to the countryside to stay with a charitable professor in his grand country manor.As the children grow tired of boring games invented by their caring but know it all sister they decide to play hide and seek.In the search for a good hiding place, Lucy(the youngest) stumbles across an ancient wardrobe which she decides will be a perfect hiding place.All is not as it seems as Lucy stumbles to the back of the wardrobe she finds herself in a mysterious snow blanketed forest in the middle of Narnia an enchanted land where it is always winter but never Christmas and it has been that way for almost one hundred years under the terrible rule of the evil white witch.Lucy meets Mr.Tummus a fawn who befriends her, when Lucy returns to the house she is surprised that no time has passed even though she was with Mr.Tummus for many hours.Of course her brothers and sister don't believe her at first until Edmund the dishonest sneaky brother of Lucy stumbles into the land of Narnia and befriends the White witch. When the two other siblings of Lucy, Peter and Susan discover that Lucy is indeed telling the truth they find themselves caught up in a battle for good and evil helping Aslan a wise lion overcome the terrible white witch and bring Narnia back to normal.Although Edmund has other ideas and selfishly chooses to join the white witch unaware of her evil intentions to kill the children and raze the prophecy,the prophecy that says two sons of Adam and two daughters of eve will overthrow the witch and rule Narnia with Aslan.This is a very entertaining movie with excellent special effects and a sweeping soundtrack.The beavers are excellent characters with hilarious cockney accents,Liam Neeson is excellent in bringing life to the mighty lion as the voice of Aslan and Tilda Swinton is a wonderful White Witch as she brings the harsh and brutal style of her character.This would be almost perfect if it weren't so rushed, great flick though definitely worth a look.8/10",8,0,0,15 April 2006
Madagascar," Not nearly as good as you would expect.
",This movie is second in the line of average animations from Dreamworks.Not since the Shrek movies has there been a great animation from that particular studio.But i'm here to talk about Madagascar it should have been a lot better. Lack of good storyline and too long gaps between amusing scenes is the main problem.The animation is superb and the penguins are genuinely funny so it would be a lie to say this is an awful movie.Really go rent a better computer generated animation like the Shrek movies any of the Pixar movies or Ice age.Really this should have been so much better. I give this movie a 6/10 as there isn't enough imagination or flare in it as great animations before it.This is my opinion but by all means go watch it and see for yourselves.,5,0,1,14 March 2006
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Good but not great
","OK after reading brilliant reviews and watching the hilarious trailers i thought that i was in for a treat in ways i was but this movie is in sad fact another of those sequels that don't live up to their originals, e.g.(Oceans 12& Shanghai Knights, although not nearly as bad as those). Don't get me wrong this movie has moments of brilliance but i felt that the jokes were too far between it just didn't have the great storyline as the first although the plot is great.Sid was hilarious,Scrat still as funny as ever as he's still on his quest to get that bloody nut,Diego still good, the tough guy with a heart of gold that we grew to love in the original and Manny who i din't mind in this movie but was better in the first.We meet three new faces a female mammoth and two mischievous possums.We start off pretty much where the original ended Manny(Ray Romano),Diego(Denis Leary) and Sid(John Legizamo) live happily in the valley when all of a sudden they realize that the ice is melting and when it does their bowl shape valley will fill up with water frighteningly fast, they begin to flee the valley in search for a boat that is at the end of the valley.Amidst all this Manny has come to realize that he is the only mammoth in the valley and that maybe his species are getting extinct.When all of a sudden Manny and the others stumble into a duo of mischievous possums who lead them to another mammoth(Queen Latifah). Manny is delighted until he realizes that this particular mammoth thinks its a possum.The animation has improved greatly from the original.This is filled with laughs.Wise words from the delightful Sid and slapstick humour from Scrat this is a funny movie.You maybe disappointed if you expect this to live up to sequels such as Shrek 2 or Toy Story 2.Nevertheless i recommend that you see it and form your own opinion.I give this movie 6/10 as i was quite disappointed with too many characters that you don't get to learn enough about to form a complete opinion.",6,5,12,1 April 2006
Finding Nemo," Pixar do it again!!
","This movie will entertain you like no other animation this year.This movie has humour,excitement,great visual effects and a knockout soundtrack.We meet Marlyn a typical clown fish who has just set up home on the coral reef off Australia with his wife coral who is about to be the mother of 300 or so unhatched baby clown fish.An awful accident happens and Marlyn loses his children and wife all 300 children except one which he decides to call Nemo.After much deliberation Nemo is allowed to go to school even though his over protective father would rather he waited a couple of years.During his first day Nemo gets caught by divers at the drop-off and brought to Sydney,Austrailia.It is now up to Marlyn and his new friend Dory the slightly vacant fish to help find Nemo.Nemo who is now in a new world to him, a fish tank in a dentists office in Sydney.This is a great movie for all ages an absolute must see.10/10",10,0,2,13 March 2006
Crash," will blow you away!!
","Crash is without a doubt one of the greatest movies this year.Director Paul Haggis was very brave to make this movie revealing an obvious problem in the u.s that people would rather leave alone.This movie deals with the collision of races in one incident that causes people to prejudge by the stereotypes that society has set for them .This movie is so true that it will scare you and makes you think what the world has come to that we have to prejudge people by their colour or culture before we know them and why people will probably never get along.But at the end of the day we all realise that all these things aside we are all people inside with thoughts, choices and the ability to judge right from wrong.Really go watch this movie if you love movies and don't believe people who say its overrated as most of them haven't seen it,don't give it a chance or they are very annoyed that Brokeback Mountain didn't win best picture although i think it was also a masterpiece it came down to the academy which awarded this the coveted award, brokeback mountain is superior but this is still amazing.10/10",8,2,8,12 March 2006
Corpse Bride," Visually amazing,
","This is a very enjoyable film although not as magic as the nightmare before Christmas.Johnny Depp is very good in this movie,the animation is superb,and the non-stop jokes are very witty.I love Tim Burton's vision for movies, it is pretty unusual but excellent nonetheless.The shapes of different characters such as Victoria's Father for example are very funny looking (in a good way) Victor is set to wed a woman he doesn't know in arranged marriage by both sets of parents.One set of parents, Victors are happy to have their only son marry into a respectable family such as Victoria's.On the other hand Victoria's parents are only agreeing to this marriage as they are bankrupt and set for the poor house.When Victor becomes nervous during the rehearsal of the wedding he walks to the woods for some time alone to think and get time to clear his head.When practicing his vows he accidentally summons a corpse to be his wife and is now in an eternal bond with Emily his corpse bride.This is an enjoyable movie one that i would recommend to anyone although it might not be to everyone's taste.7/10-Doesn't quite have the magic of the nightmare before Christmas but it's up there",7,0,1,16 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," great movie
",This movie is a refreshing new look at the world of harry potter and his friends with a new director it is perfect as it adds a different style and view of the book i would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Alfonso Cuaron on creating such a great movie the whole cast have grown up in appearance and in their roles from the very start you can see the cast as mature teenage actors Daniel Radcliffe delivers a good performance as Harry whereas Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint(Ron) are also very good.This darker and more exciting year at hogwarts is beautifully directed and the cgi is far superior to the first two movies maybe because they were a bit rushed.the time turner sequence is excellently executed i loved it.Harry is about to start an ordinary year at hogwarts(well ordinary to him)talk of a mysterious escapee from azkaban prison fills the air with this mysterious Sirius Black coming straight to hogwarts and Harry Potter and a new defence against the dark arts teacher this is going to be a eventful year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES...,9,0,2,30 January 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Powerful Stuff!
","I will just start off with saying that this is an excellent movie. Tom Hanks' character is superb as he again proves that he is one of the best actors still going today.The direction is magnificent, bravo Steven Spielberg who shows that war is absolutely not glamorous. Spielberg can enthrall audiences like no other.The battle on Omaha beach was powerful ,extraordinary stuff.We start this movie with the attack on Omaha beach, D-day 1944.Captain John.H.Miller(Tom Hanks)leads his regiment up on to the sands meanwhile being bombarded by Nazi gunmen.When Omaha Beach is seized by the American and British forces John is asked to embark on a mission to save a soldier who's three brothers had just died and who now has a ticket home to his grieving mother.John agrees and begins the task of saving Private Ryan all the while his regiment wonder why they must risk their lives to save one man.This is a great movie but very intense and powerful.The battle scenes are superb.A definite must see for any lover of great movies.Go watch this movie one of the best in its genre. 10/10 - Unmissable",9,19,37,12 April 2006
Cars," Enjoyable Right Up To The Finish Line
","this is a very enjoyable movie from start to the finish line(pun intended)Pixar have done it again...This time with cars ,the imagination and ideas behind this movie are incredibly funny...Without the use of humans in this movie it makes all that bit more exciting and enjoyable ..to see a Volkswagen camper van as a hippy and a hummer as Arnold Schwarzenegger is just pure genius.Lightning McQueen(Owen Wilson)is a hot shot race car who cares about no one except himself.When lightning finds himself stuck in the run down town of radiator springs whilst on the way to a big race, he meets new friends who teach him that friendship is much more important than winning.I left the theatre with a gleeful smile on my face like that of a child who had just seen a his very first animated movie.Stay for the credits and you wont regret it! 8/10- a worthy contender for best animation at next years Oscars",7,3,7,10 August 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Very good
",I loved this movie the storyline was good and very enjoyable to watch it unfold...the special effects-second to none...the acting well what can i say Hugh Jackman excellent as ever as the heroic Logan/wolverine.Ian Mckellan was a superb Magneto showing an excellent character with both good and bad qualities.Patrick Stewart as wonderful as ever as the wise Dr.Xavier.Halle Berry a good adaption of Storm not a slip up quite decent acting.Famke Janssen a wonderful tormented and powerful Jean who was excellent in her part.Vinnie Jones although just a small part as Juggernaut he was okay i have to say he didn't really slip up just mediocre acting but fitted the part just fine.All in all a very good sequel which the new director made excellent...Bret Ratner a good choice although i don't think that i've seen any of his previous works i thought this was very good and enjoyable.7/10-very good and definitely worth a watch,5,0,1,26 May 2006
Moulin Rouge!," 'It's Quite Modern but if your open i think you might enjoy it'
","Moulin Rouge!, directed by Baz Luhrmann who most of you will know from the modern take on Romeo + Juliet. If You have seen Romeo + Juliet than you have most likely already decided that you like his style or not.As with Romeo + Juliet, i adore Moulin Rouge. From its wacky beginning to its spine tingling and heartbreaking final act. The songs are magnificent, using modern lyrics and incorporating them into excellent songs was a great idea. The acting is superb with amazing performances from Nicole Kidman and Ewan McCregor who, not only played their parts to perfection but sung in all their roles and did it amazingly well. I love everything about Moulin Rouge, every song, every scene and every line. For me there is absolutely no faults at all in this modern Masterpiece.One thing is for certain, you will either love it or hate it. For some people i appreciate it just might not be your type of movie but if you give it a chance and love it like i did then you will witness one of the most groundbreaking modern masterpieces in recent history that i'm sure you will watch and re-watch over and over again.As for the co-stars, John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent and Richard Roxburgh are all excellent in their roles. This movie is amazing and one not to be missed for its audience pleasing style,its amazing set design,costumes and songs, its excellent acting and storytelling and it's utter difference from anything you might have seen previously.10/10- Amazing,beautiful,heart-breaking, one of the best movies i have ever seen.",10,1,3,2 April 2007
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," I loved it
","A Harry Potter movie for the first time in the franchise's history seems almost overshadowed by the fact that the final book in this extremely successful series is due just over a week after the cinematic release of one of the book adaptations. However this brings nothing away from the fact that this movie will be extremely successful.Before i got to see this movie Prisoner of Azkaban was by far my favourite of the adaptations with Goblet of fire close behind (mostly for it's action as i felt that it is almost disappointing after re-watching compared to its magnificent book) First and foremost i must say that i thought David Yates' version of Order of the Phoenix was as near to perfect as i could hope from the shortest movie in the series ( although it was the longest book). Daniel Radcliffe has for the first time in my opinion portrayed Harry perfectly compared to some of the weak acting we have grown accustomed to from his previous outings in the franchise. Obviously Radcliffe has matured more as an actor having a lot more confidence in his role and funnily enough this has been the hardest challenge for his character yet in terms of acting having to bring across realistic sympathy for this character who is going through all the angst and confusion of someone slowly being possessed by Voldemort. I say this because for the first time i don't think i cringed once at one thing he said in this potter movie. We may put this simply down to the fact that he bravely got his wand out on stage in 'Equus' and that this gave him some confidence but i really think that Radcliffe is beginning to blossom into a good actor(perhaps a little late in the franchise but time will tell.) Now to the story, as i said the shortest movie running at 2hrs and 18mins even though it is based on a 736 page book. Of course things were going to be left out and they are, but unless we wanted a 15hr long movie there is bound to be things left out. I think where Newell failed in GOF, Yates thrived in OOTP, Yates has perfectly captured the feeling in this story showing us how alone Harry feels and the beautiful relationship he has with Sirius his godfather. This was very important for the ending of the story which i do not want to ruin for people who are not fans of the book.So Yates brings us the story perfectly setting up relationships that we know are going to be significant in the next movie by leaving nice little subtle hints here and there. Also by using a mainly TV experienced director we have the potter series in a totally different way with completely different techniques. Never before have we had flashbacks from the other movies ( which i thought was a success) or slow motion sequences which do not come across as tacky but slotted in perfectly to catch the audiences attention or to arouse emotion also the use of the shaking camera which would usually be more of a TV thing is perfectly used in the start which makes the audience feel much more engaged in it.The acting, well what can i say i don't think that there was one piece of extremely weak acting this time around as all the teenagers are growing into young adults and becoming much more asserted in their roles. As for new castings, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge the High inquisitor at hogwarts was amazing. I don't think i have seen someone that deliciously evil on screen for sometime giving us a shocking performance that if an actor from a harry potter film was ever to get an Oscar nomination this would be it. A great performance in which even the slightest giggle or ' so silly of me' can come across as evil.Evanna lynch as Luna Lovegood, an Irish girl who is a major fan of the books and probably the best bit of casting in this franchise and that is not an over-statement, her dreamy voice and manner bring across the eccentricity of the bewildering character that we can't help but fall in love with.All the cast deserve honourable mentions, Michael Gambon,Emma Watson, Rupert Grint,Gary Oldman and Helena Bonham Carter all playing their parts brilliantly.All in all, this movie is a brilliantly crafted tense thriller throughout relying on the eerie atmosphere throughout the second act to catch the audiences attention, we can feel a great sense of growing danger but not one that we can fully put our finger on. Also, This movie is probably, the most touching,moving,and funny of the series so far with great thought put into character development and relationships between the characters.Harry is growing up having his first kiss in this movie which i thought was a well done scene but surpassed by the one that followed in which Harry is asked by Ron and Hermione ' How was it?' 'Wet' He Replies.Also with Michael Gambon back on form as Dumbledore the scene in which he escapes arrest is perfectly done with a great sign off from Shacklebolt, ' I know you may not like him minister, but you gotta admit Dumbledore's got style' This movie sets us up for what is to come since POA we have known that harry ain't no little kid with silly magic tricks and the darkness in the the 5th movie of the potter franchise perfectly conveys this with the amazing third act at the ministry that will leave you literally begging for more.I give this a slightly biased 10/10 which some people may think is a lot.. but i loved it and i highly recommend it to everyone but i think it will be much more in the taste of the book's fans.",8,1,4,14 July 2007
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Powerful, Gut Wrenching And Epic - Probably The Greatest Irish Movie Ever
","This movie is superb go and see it, if you have a drop of Irish blood in you,you will realise how important this movie is to us.The acting is top notch and the direction by ken loach is top draw.This movie tells the story of Irish rebel's fight for independence from the most powerful country in the world.It is well deserving of the canne's Palm D'or.It is also a great credit to his country that a Hollywood acclaimed actor such as Cillian Murphy would star in such an important Irish film when it is obvious that he didn't do it for the money but for love of his country,He was excellent in this movie.This tale of Sacrifice,Freedom and Defiance is my favourite in a year when sequels and remakes rule the box-office.We follow Damien(Cillian Murphy)a trained doctor who decides to join the rebels to drive out the British after he see's how badly his country is suffering.After the violence and sacrifice he encounters he begins to question if his country is worth all of it.It is a gut wrenching,epic and powerful tale and one that shouldn't be missed.I adored this movie and if it were to come out in the united states this year i couldn't see anything beating it to best picture in the academy awards.Don't pay head to the harsh ratings this is an amazing film go see it! 10/10",9,3,10,27 August 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Amazing!!!!!!
","Harry Potter's 4th year at hogwarts is about to begin unbeknown to him this will be his hardest to date with the tri-wizard tournament coming to hogwarts where two schools visit the school and a champion is chosen to compete from each of the three schools by the goblet of fire. All three of the champions must compete in a series of magical contests each as deadly and as demanding as the next.Everything is fine until harry's name comes out of the goblet of fire as the mysterious 4th competitor at the age of 14 when the entry age is 17.Its certain that something is going on as harry competes and has the most eventful and hardest year of his life...This is the best of the series so far without a doubt.I loved all of the others previous to this Harry Potter.But G.O.F is without a doubt the darkest,most exciting,most breathtaking and best directed of them all.I've been keenly anticipating this since the end credits of P.O.A all the acting has been improved the trio have all matured well in their roles as Harry,Hermione & Ron(Rupert Grint- still brilliant as ever) death eaters were genuinely scary.Beauxbatons and Durmstrang entrance to the great hall was excellent although i wish that Hagrid(Robert Coltraine)had a bit more dialog as he is brilliant in all the movies.The yule ball was visually amazing.Duel with Voldemort at the end was excellent.Voldemort who was played by Ralph Fiennes was excellent and Ralph Fiennes sucked everything he could out of the character.Expect only aces in special effects and action in this 4th installment of J.k. Rowling's magnificent series of books.I give this 10/10 absolutely brilliant!!!! Go see this movie this is the best movie of 2005 along with star wars episode III and king Kong.Its true that a lot of material was cut from this book but that will always happen when someone is asked to adapt a 500 or so page book into a movie that keeps you entertained and watching.If everything from the book was put in we would be watching a sixteen hour long movie.I think the books are brilliant but the movies are different from the books its a fact so to all those die hard Potter fans who will nit pick at every detail and say its an awful movie just accept it for what it is an enjoyable,exciting,action packed adaption of a marvellous book. This is my opinion please go and watch it.",8,1,3,20 November 2005
Ice Age," great animation to rival even pixar.

The Last King of Scotland," Excellent movie, brilliant acting and a superbly paced thriller
","I rented the academy award and BAFTA award winning 'The Last King Of Scotland' last night and all i can say is wow...Forest Whitaker blew me away with his portrayal of Idi Amin, his performance captivates you and he's so unpredictable that you never know what he'll do next. Even though i was rooting for Dicaprio to get the Oscar this year i have to say Whitaker definitely deserved it for his amazingly powerful and charismatic performance.James McAvoy my favourite upcoming actor at the moment, he was excellent in his role playing the dictators Scottish personal adviser. I can really see good things for him, watch this space.The movie as a whole is brilliantly paced and at some times breathtaking. It is quite gruesome towards the end and i found myself almost unable to watch in some scenes but it all played out to be an amazing movie. This goes along with my favourites of the year 2006 such as: The Departed,The Prestige,Casino Royale,Little Miss Sunshine,Borat,Hot Fuzz,Blood Diamond, etc.Definitely worth a watch for some great entertainment, thrilling storyline and superb acting both on Whitaker's and Mcavoy's parts.9/10",9,0,1,14 July 2007
The Green Mile," a film with monumental force
","This movie, well what can i say from the same director and author of The Shawshank Redemption which you can sort of guess from numerous similarities.The movie starts off in an elderly peoples home where we meet Paul Edgecomb a resident at the home he talks with his friend and eventually starts telling her the story of John Coffey...We go back some 60 years to the time when Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks -who i thought was magnificent in this film)worked in the 'E' block in Louisiana state prison everything in this prison is pretty routine with nearly all the cell mates on death row bound for a visit to the electric chair this all changes when John Coffey(Michael Clarke Duncan- also exceptional) who was wrongly accused of the rape and murder of two small girls ,the man who stands at a bit over 8ft comes into the 'E' block upset and with a remorseful look on his face the guards are soon very shocked to discover that this giant of a man is afraid of the dark.The Guards soon find out the mysteriousness of this man who it seems couldn't of been guilty of this crime as they also find out that he has the power to perform miracles.This is a magnificent movie one that I strongly advise any movie lover to see it is a very upsetting movie so don't try to promise yourself that your not going to cry or be very emotional because when the credits come rolling you really cant help it not as great as Shawshank but definitely up there.10/10 WITHOUT A DOUBT!Deserves to be up in the top 50 movies of all time not in the 120's!!!!!",9,2,4,14 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," best movie of the year!!!
",I will start off with saying that I'm a huge fan if the two previous prequels although they lacked the flare and greatness of the originals which are some of my favourite movies of all time from the very start of this movie i could see that i was in for a breathtaking adventure and that was even before the first bits of dialogue the cgi just takes your breath away Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen are equally brilliant in this movie all I can say is bravo George Lucas .Three years after the start of the clone wars the Jedi master and apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are fighting to save the planet of coruscant from separatist droid armies in the midst of all this the supreme chancellor palpatine is kidnapped and it is up to the two Jedi knights to retrieve him this movie conveyes the transformation for anakin skywalker to the dark side as temptation and false truths lead him to become the person he was trying to defeat in the first place and put his friendship and marriage at huge risk as anakin becomes Darth Vader.,8,1,2,31 January 2006
The Lion King," best animation ever!!
","The movie starts with the birth of simba the lion cub. (this opening sequence has got to be one of the greatest scenes from an animated feature ever put on the silver screen)as the movie progresses a plot is schemed by Mufasa's(simba's dad)brother scar to kill the king(Mufasa)and take over the pride lands.Tricked into thinking that he killed his father, Simba flees the pride lands where he meets Pumba and Timon who show him the ways of life.But its only a matter of time until Simba returns to take his rightful place as king and take revenge for his fathers death.This movie is most certainly for all ages it will make you laugh and cry.This is in my opinion the best animated feature ever.10/10",10,0,0,13 March 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," One of my favourites...
",*******MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**********The story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover (the first few minutes at the start captivate you from the beginning)Andy is wrongly convicted and sent to Shawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentence.Andy finds a new companion called Red(Morgan Freeman) the man who can get things for anyone in the prison for the right price. As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from time to time for somebody Red doesn't find it particularly odd that andy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in 1949.Of course he accepts.The line that defines this great piece of cinema is 'get busy living or get busy dying'.This movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and remember always- FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE!,10,3,4,12 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," an absolute masterpiece!!!!
",We start off with a flash back to the times where Gollum or smeagol was one of the riverfolk not unlike a hobbit.We see how smeagol came into the possession of the ring and how he transformed into smeagol.The battle for middle earth is about to begin as Gondor prepare for war also in hope of aid from ancient ally's Rohan the Troops of Mordor are about to launch an attack upon Minas Tirith so hard that Middle earth as we know it will be lost forever.Frodo and sam struggle to keep up with there guide smeagol who it seems is about to bring them into great danger.The ring of power must be destroyed by being cast into the flames of mount doom where it as made and the only place it can be unmade before sauron unleashes his armies upon the whole of middle earth.This is well deserving of its place in the top 250.After eagerly awaiting this movie since the end credits of two towers i am proud to say that this is my favourite movie of all time.I loved this movie the cgi is absolutely mind blowing and battle at Minas Tirith was literally breathtaking.The final chapter in this epic journey is a must see for all lovers of action/fantasy movies. After just watching the trilogy non-stop over the weekend i couldn't tear my eyes away from it and you get so engrossed in it that you don't notice anything around you but the screen which is captivating you with every scene Peter Jackson is god to me this movie's well deserving of 11 Oscars. 10/10.,10,1,2,2 January 2006
Munich," what an absolute masterpiece!
","This movie is one of the best action movies of the year high octane,thrilling and very exciting.This movie is definitely not for the weak hearted as it is very intense and violent in scenes.In September 1972 the world watched on as one by one 11 Israeli athletes were killed by a Palestinian terrorist group called black September during the Munich Olympics.This movie tells what happened next a group of men are employed by the Mossad a secret Israeli organisation to kill and take revenge on all those who had a hand in planning Munich.Avner(Eric Bana)is appointed as head of the group and not permitted to go home to Israel until his job is done.Soon things begin to go wrong as the killing gets out of hand and Avner soon realises that he is just as bad as the people he is trying to kill,the people who planned Munich.This movie has great acting,great directing and a killer soundtrack.This is a great movie and not one to be taken light heartedly.This movie has a greater meaning than revenge it shows us the extreme effects of violence on people and the paranoia and hell they go through to escape it.But please don't just take my word for it please check it out for yourself!10/10",9,2,3,14 March 2006
300," Neither as Great nor As Awful as i could have anticipated
","I have been keenly awaiting this movie since i first saw the trailer for it a few months back. I thought wow it's truly amazing what they can do with cgi and it also looks pretty cool i'll definitely check that out. I went to 300 tonight trying not to keep my hopes up as i could easily be disappointed but what i saw neither amazed me or disappointed me. The special effects are second to none and are truly what carry this film they are breathtaking. The use of rock music really gets your pulse running and is very effective during battle scenes as with the breathtaking slow motion sequences. Although, if i had not seen the trailer for this movie beforehand i would have been much more absorbed in the awe of the special effects. After a while, while still loving it i had seen it all. Still quite amazing though. The acting i would not go so far to say excellent but it held up well and Gerard Butler as King Leonidas was very good at holding such a powerful role. At parts i did find myself thinking ' why did they put that in?' ' or is that really necessary?' but not being a fan of the comic i can't really be one to pass judgement. Ultimately this movie has all the factors to assure it's box office success : Violence,great action scenes, very good music and of course female nudity. These key factors will appeal to all teenage boys who will make the box office success of 300 soar. I thought this movie was very good, not amazing,not a masterpiece but still very good. Take it from me if your my age you will really enjoy this, I'm fifteen.Verdict- 7/10 Very enjoyable and some amazing moments make 300 a very good war movie but it does seem to be lacking a killer factor. It's problem was that it was rushed slightly and didn't leave enough time for any real feeling or emotion to set in. Despite that i thought it was very good but unfortunately it doesn't live up to masterpieces in this genre such as gladiator,etc. this is pretty much a throw away epic enjoyable but not extremely rememberable.",7,4,9,24 March 2007
Gladiator," The general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator ,the gladiator who defied an empire.
","After coming out victorious against a barbarian army in a battle that had lasted several years General Maximus Decimus Meridius(Russel Crowe) is summoned to the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) who chooses him as the future heir to succeed him over his only son.When his power hungry son Commodus (Joquain Phoenix) finds out he orders Maximus to be executed. When Maximus escapes the execution he flees home to Spain but is too late his wife and his son have been killed and his house and property burnt to the ground by Roman generals ordered by the new emperor (commodus).Maximus is captured and sold as a slave in Carthage to a wealthy man Proximo and is ordered to fight as a gladiator.As his love by the crowd rises he's brought to Rome to fight at the Colleseum.For the entertainment of the new emperor.Maximus comes to Rome and begins to seek revenge for his family's murders.This is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack,excellent acting,magnificent direction by Ridley Scott and amazing special effects.This one of my favourite movies of all time and if Peter Jacksons movies and George Lucas' had not come along i would be saying that this is probably the best of the 21st century so far.Go watch this masterpiece of a movie one of the best of its kind.10/10",10,0,1,14 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Stupid,dumb but frickin hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable.
","Okay i love great movies ...e.g(american beauty,lotr trilogy,star wars,saving private Ryan,fight club,etc.)But everyone once in a while loves to sit down and watch a stupid dumb but frickin hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable movie..in my opinion talladega nights fits that bill perfectly..I really couldn't stop laughing in this movie..Along with witty one liners and a hilarious co cast..Will Ferrell proves that he is probably one of the funniest men alive.Will Ferrell plays the competitive and stupid nascar driver Ricky Bobby who is content on nothing but winning until Jean Girrard(Sacha Baron Cohen who i thought was hilarious as the gay french formula 1 driver)comes onto the nascar circuit and at once Ricky has met his match..after a nervous breakdown Ricky loses everything except his kids and parents..who teach him that winning isn't everything like he always thought..This is completely stupid all the way through but brilliantly entertaining and frickin hilarious..Best comedy of the year along with clerks 2 & Borat.7/10- a great movie to watch at the cinema and one of the funniest this year ..i strongly recommend this movie",7,6,12,16 September 2006
