Blade Runner 2049," Glorious
","I have been a fan of Blade Runner since the 1982 original, my favorite movie of all time. Each of us can identify with the pursuit of life, the search for meaning and identity, the struggle to survive. All this and much more is presented in gorgeous cinematography, intense characters, and a fascinating story in 2049.Long live Blade Runner!",10,4,14,17 October 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Great Film
","This is not my typical movie, so it took me a while to get around to watching it. I am usually in the sci fi and action genres. I was not disappointed. A great story about Everyman heroes and corporate greed.The catastrophic failure of the oil rig was perfectly portrayed and left me on the edge of my seat. And when the hero, Mike, finally reunited with his family, I felt like crying for joy with them.It is an important story to tell. There should be more light shed on coroporate greed, especially when it leads to harming people and our environment.",9,0,1,1 July 2018

Murder on the Orient Express," Absolute Perfection!
","Flawless directing, gorgeous cinematography, incredible acting, thrilling mystery, spectacular ending! Bullseye!",10,1,6,9 September 2018
Wonder Woman," Love Chris and Gal....In other films
","Good movie, but it missed the target....Pairing Chris Pine with Gal Gadot made Wonder Woman look like a lost, naive, simpleton who understands nothing about the world. In an effort to make a film about a strong, independent woman, the director set her up to need a man to accomplish her mission. She comes off as nothing more than an effective body guard with a really cool shield....Suggestion: In the next film, show her with wisdom and experience. Let her be more than just clumsy eye candy.",7,0,3,1 July 2018
The Greatest Showman," I'm Ready to Watch it Again
","Beautiful story, fantastic music, gorgeous settings, wonderful acting....A perfect musical.",10,2,3,26 September 2018
