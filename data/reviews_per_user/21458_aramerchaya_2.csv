Hereditary," Well done d#ckhead.!
","40 years old. Horror movie junkie. Never written a movie review in my life.So I am sitting here watching Hereditary. Noise cancellation headphones on. I had a glass of water (2 slices of cucumber) sitting next to me on the couch. Glass falls over. Makes the most subtle & muffled 'thump' sound. I FREAK OUT, YELLING AT THE TOP OF MY VOICE. 5 minutes later, police knocking on my door... 'Is everything alright?'. You gotta love Australia. You gotta love Toni Collette. You gotta love this movie. SO MUCH RESPECT! OODLES!",9,2,5,6 November 2018
Annihilation," 35 minutes into the movie...
","...and I got my first scare. Very (very) well done. The storyline is sporadic, but clearly the director is trying a non-linear narrative. I'm excited.! Will update this review after the movie is over. Not sure what people are complaining about. Jussayin. Letseeeee....",Null,0,1,28 January 2019
