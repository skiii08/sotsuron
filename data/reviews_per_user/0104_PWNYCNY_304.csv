Saturday Night Fever," Classic movie.
","Karen Lynn Gorney's performance in this movie is worthy of accolades. She carries this movie and makes this movie into a powerful dramatic story about two young persons who are forced to confront the truth about themselves and as a result grow up.There aren't enough accolades to describe this movie. It is one of the great movie musicals not only because of the great acting, exceptional music, excellent musical numbers and exceptional choreography, but because of the story itself. Instead of fluff, the movie presents a strong, engaging story that is timeless. As a result, the movie avoids becoming a period piece which makes it as watchable today as when it was first released in 1977. The term 'classic' is a word that should be used sparingly, especially for Hollywood movies which for the most part are pot-boiler remakes of remakes of remakes, crass commercial products utterly devoid of any artistic originality. However, this movie is a classic. It has withstood the test of time and presents a complex story with themes that are as relevant today as they were when this movie was released thirty years ago. This surprisingly unique movie dramatizes a wide range of social issues that still plague society today. These issues include alienation, racial strife, family discord, class conflict and other symptoms of social pathology that if anything have intensified. The movie's power is further enhanced by the excellent acting and timeless music that together with a compelling story make this movie something special, not just another commercial product but a work of art, a true classic.",10,3,5,18 August 2007
Insidious: Chapter 2," Possession, evil spirits and heroes.
","This is a good movie. The story is somewhat muddled but that is more than made up for by the acting and the characters. The idea of someone actually being someone else is not new, but in this movie it is given a new twist, with good results. The star of this movie is Barbara Hershey whose presence improves this movie a lot. Malevolent spirits in a alternate universe interacting with the living to cause mayhem can come off as hokey, but in this movie it works. The connection between the here and there is established and is made to seem believable. Children are most vulnerable to manipulation, but there are heroes too, which balances out the story. Elise is a hero, in both worlds. Patrick Wilson gives a strong performance as a man possessed for decades. What is real and not real becomes blurred as behavior becomes more erratic and violent and those around you can only wonder and become concerned - and frightened. How would you feel if one day you discovered that your spouse was possessed by an evil spirit?",8,1,2,4 October 2013
Moneyball," Excellent inside glimpse of the operation of a major league baseball team.
","If you want gain a better understanding of the operation of a baseball club, this is the movie to watch. This movie dramatizes the role of the general manager, the key front office person who seldom is in the limelight but whose decisions effect the operation of an entire baseball organization. No baseball club will be successful without an effective general manager, but even if the g.m. is effective, there is still no guarantee that this will produce a winning ball club because much of what the g.m. does depends on luck. In baseball, the g.m. is gambling on the players being able to play well, and often the gamble fails. The players get injured, they have emotional issues, attitude problems, labor-management conflicts, events outside of the g.m.'s control that effect the players' performances. It happens all the time. The field manager may be in charge of the players on the field but it is the general manager who has overall responsibility for the team's performance. This is an excellent movie about baseball, as told from the the vantage point of the general manager, a vantage point that is seldom, if ever, dramatized. Yet, there is probably no job in baseball that is more critical to the success of the team then the general manager's. The GM is the guy (or gal) who is charged with the responsibility for putting together the team. The GM signs the players and makes the trades. The field manager is much more visible but it is the GM who provides the players for the field manager to manage. This movie is about one GM who is unique among GMs since he was actually once a baseball player, albeit a marginal player, who worked his way up the front office ladder. Brad Pitt does an admirable job portraying the field manager. The movie, however, asks the audience to accept a premise that is unsustainable, namely, that the GM hit upon an idea for putting together a winning team according to some kind of mathematical formula based on percentages. This idea, playing the percentages, is as old as baseball itself. Actually, the GM is effective because he can relate to the more marginal, and less expensive, players and believes that if properly managed, these players can get on base just as often as the higher priced players. This idea, too, is as old as baseball itself. Also, the GM's 'system' fails, that is, his team loses in the playoffs, which sort of takes the wind out the story's sails. Nevertheless, this movie provides an excellent inside glimpse of the operation of a major league baseball team and the challenges confronting the front office in putting together a competitive team.",10,2,5,3 October 2011
The Avengers," Perhaps the best movie in the action sci-fi genre.
","For pure entertainment, this movie cannot be surpassed. Not only does the movie entertain, it does it well. The movie is not only well-acted, it has a great story with snappy dialog, impeccably delivered by an all-star cast. The special effects are phenomenal and the movie succeeds in keeping and maintaining the audience's interest and attention. Even the bad guys are wonderful. This movie is probably the best sci-fi action movie in years, perhaps in all of cinematic history. It combines all of the best features of the sci-fi genre plus a generous inclusion of amusing one-liners which lets the audience know that this movie is supposed to be fun to watch. Here, the director succeeds in transforming a comic-book story into a something substantive and enjoyable. For these reason, this movie is worth watching.",10,1,4,5 May 2012
Vertigo," This movie is great.
","This movie features incredibly powerful acting by the two stars, James Stewart and Kim Novak. In fact, this story is so actor-driven that it is unlikely that with different actors the movie would have been as nearly as powerful. Stewart plays a character, Scotty, who is being cruelly manipulated by two people for ulterior purposes that become apparent only later in the movie. What drives the story forward is the interaction between Scotty and the woman, Madeleine, whose deviousness is only matched by her own emotional vulnerability. Emotions become confused as victim and manipulator become more involved. Besides being arguably James Stewart's most emotionally evocative performance, it propels the movie to a dramatic crescendo that is completely engaging. It is virtually impossible for an audience not to empathize with Scotty's emotional torment. Yet, what makes the movie even more provocative is the way in which the two characters are portrayed - as people with whom one can identify. Scotty and Madeleine are plausible characters. Without going into detail, suffice it that Kim Novak gives the best performance of her career. The cinematography is excellent. This is a great movie.",10,2,3,1 August 2014
Black Swan," Superb, brilliant, phenomenal.
","This is the best movie this reviewer has seen in at least the past ten years and as an unabashed movie buff and movie reviewer, that covers a lot of movies. Natalie Portman's performance is stunning, amazing, phenomenal. If she does not win the Academy Award for Best Actress then that will be shocker. Every facet of her performance is perfect. She carries the movie. She is truly the star. As for Mila Kunis, her performance is absolutely worthy of award recognition. Known as a comic actress, in this movie her performance is masterful and chilling. What a wonderful, strong performance! Vincent Cassel once again proves that he is one of the greatest screen actors today. His performance can only be described in terms of superlatives. Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder are also fully deserving of praise for their strong performances. But the best part of the movie is the direction, masterfully done by Darren Aronofsky. He manages to put together a brilliant work of art, successfully combining all the elements needed to produce a movie that is superb. Great story, great acting, great cinematography, great script, in short a great movie.",10,4,10,13 December 2010
Changeling," Abuse of power - an old story but well told here.
","Abuse of power can be ugly and creates lots of havoc and hurt lots of people. But sometimes it also brings out the best in people as they marshal all their strength and determination to confront and combat the abuse. This movie is about one of those instances where one person, without influence, with few resources but with indomitable will, stands up to a corrupt system, draws a line, and makes her stand. In short, this movie is about heroism and redemption. Cruelty is always repugnant but perhaps never more so then when perpetrated by the very people who swear to protect and defend us. We as members of society invest them with a sacred trust which they in turn promise to honor. This movie is about one of those instances where that sacred trust is dashed to the ground and stomped into the dirt under the dubious pretension of enforcing the law and protecting the public. And what can be more dastardly than the victim being a young single mother? Who among us is more in need of protection and care than a young single mother? What kind of community would even think of wanting to crush a single mother whose only 'crime' is that she wants to find her son? This movie poses these questions and does so with a quiet strength that is only equaled by the fundamental forthrightness of the story itself. This story is not a melodrama; there are no hysterics. Rather the story speaks for itself with an eloquence that is almost nonexistent in movies today. Angelina Jolie's performance is outstanding. She dominates this movie. She is the star and deservedly so.Yes, the movie is a little on the long side, at times seems to drag out, but so what? Here sensationalism takes a back seat to story telling. The supporting cast is excellent and there is a good mixture of pathos and indignation that contribute to keeping the story interesting. The 'bad guys' are actually bad because they knew that what they were doing was wrong but did it anyway out of a crass desire to protect their reputations. How pathetic. This movie is about what happens when one person refuses to knuckle under and confronts the system with the only thing she has going for her, the truth. This theme alone makes the movie well worth watching.",10,6,10,7 November 2008
Men in Black 3," This is Josh Brolin's movie.
","When a movie has a shallow plot, comic-book characters, overblown special effects, and lead actors who, due to the sheer passage of time, no longer seem right for their roles, something has to do be done to make the movie watchable, and this the movie accomplishes in the person of Josh Brolin. Mr. Brolin's performance saves this movie from a quick exit to DVD-land. He brings an intensity to the role that galvanizes the movie. The plot itself is so contrived as to render it ludicrous; its lack of substance is apparent throughout. Hence, the movie depends on strong performances which, with the exception of Mr. Brolin's, it does not provide. Reprising roles from the past can be tricky, and in the case of Will Smith, it does not work. He is a wonderful actor but not in this movie; his role is no longer the right one for him. This is Josh Brolin's movie.",7,5,9,26 May 2012
The New World," Long boring movie.
","This movie was nominated for an Academy Award? For what? For best movie for producing boredom? What a long ... drawn out ... ponderous ... pretentious ... piece of Hollywood pseudodocudrama. (Yawn) Oh, watching Captain Smith and Pocahontas doing touchy-feely while the whites and Indians are literally preparing to kill each other was extraordinarily underwhelming. The arrival of the English in 1607 was an important moment in history but as usual Hollywood reduces it to a mere historical backdrop for an improbable and ludicrous love story between a little Indian girl and bedraggled discredited Englishman who, with the rest of his group, were unwelcome guests on someone else's turf. What this movie fails to answer is: Why did this little girl love John Smith? According to the movie, Captain Smith had no leadership skills, was universally disliked, was a failure as a soldier and inspired scorn from amongst his peers. The actress who plays Pocahantas is cute but her acting skills need further development. She simply is not convincing in the role nor did she look the part. If you like long boring movies then this movie is for you.",5,3,4,9 April 2008
Scarface," Chilling movie
","In 1983 I found this movie to be flawed but entertaining in a campy sort of way. Here was Al Pacino playing a Cuban gangster, along with a whole bunch of other non-Hispanic actors playing various Latin American characters. To me it added to the essential surrealist quality of the movie. Well, 23 years later, I watched the same movie and my impressions have changed. This movie is anything but surrealistic. This movie is a powerful dramatization of what happens when a psychopath grabs power. This is Al Pacino's greatest movie. Here he plays a character who is angry, alienated, dispossessed, morally depraved and marginalized. His own mother wants nothing to do with him. His own sister is utterly corrupted by his presence. Unlike Michael in The Godfather, whose own depravity is at least blunted by the veneer of middle class civility, Tony's behavior is upfront, unambiguous, without restraint and utterly lacking in finesse. Everything he does is based on cunning and brute force. Unlike the Godfather, Tony doesn't need an organization to run his operation, he IS the organization. Nor does he pretend to be anything other than what he is, a gangster. For Tony is a product of the culture of violence that pervades society, produces characters like Tony Montana and supplies Hollywood with the material with which to make these kind of chilling movies.Further comments: the story is tragic. Tony is doomed from the start. He wants it all but doesn't have the education or temperament to channel his efforts in a way so as to avoid self-destruction. He is like a locomotive building speed and unable to stop because he doesn't have brakes. Now, Tony is not bad person; he is a product of a materialistic culture that measures success in terms of money. For Tony the equation is simple: money equals power which in turn equals self worth. Tony has the potential to do great things, but having been brutalized has warped his character, and so for him money is toxic - the more he accumulates the more paranoid he becomes. That's too bad because all that potential goes to waste, with tragic consequences.",9,0,1,3 November 2006
Frost_Nixon," For $600,000 a politician might say just about anything.
","Imagine this scene. You're in a theater, the lights are dimming, the curtain is rising, the spotlight brightens the center of the stage and into that bright spotlight enters ... Richard M. Nixon. Then the spotlight widens and reveals another man, David Frost. They both bow to the audience and then take a seat and start a conversation about Richard Nixon. It's not journalism, it's theater. It's not candid, it's rehearsed. It's not spontaneous, it's been meticulously planned by Frost and an entire production company which has been selling air time to pay for Mr. Nixon's fee. Then after the interview both men go their separate ways, one with a check for $600,000 in his pocket, the other with a newfound career as the entertainment impresario, all this under the guise of journalism, affording it a degree of legitimacy demanded by historians and political scientists. Unlike his 1960 television appearance with the dapper and confident John F. Kennedy, which was not theater but a political debate, Mr. Nixon is cool, calm and gets flustered only when the intensity of the interview begins to sag, necessitating something dramatic to generate audience interest in what is an otherwise humdrum affair. For who cares what Mr. Nixon has to say? And besides, how long can anyone be expected to listen to the disgraced ex-President drone on and on about his family, his checkered political career, his almost laughable debate with Chairman Khrushchev, his strange relationship with Mr. Kissinger and his meetings with Chairman Brezhnev and Chairman Mao, before falling asleep? And Mr. Frost knows this and he communicates his concerns to Mr. Nixon who obliges as a good performer should, for he is after all Mr. Frost's paid employee who has been given a golden opportunity to emerge from his exile, a chance for one last appearance before the public for which the disgraced ex-President and pardoned wrongdoer is grateful. Then years pass and someone decides to invest millions of dollars in time and money to make a movie about the staged 'coming out' of this unusual and troubled man. Strange indeed but Hollywood has done a lot worse and besides a dose of Richard Nixon, properly packaged, is something the public may enjoy provided the dose is not too big, not too strong and not too offensive. Careers have been made and destroyed trying to figure out the life and career of Richard M. Nixon and this movie is but the latest addition to the Nixon genre, once again leaving the audience to wonder: was he really such a bad guy? Did he really have to resign? There is Richard Nixon as politician. Nixon as crook. Nixon as president. Nixon as an historical figure. And now: Nixon as stage actor. For that is Mr. Nixon's role in this dramatization of a series of interviews produced, staged and conducted not by a journalist, not by a scholar, not by a writer, but by a TV impresario who secures the services of a well-known performer, who happens to be a disgraced ex-President of the United States, to put on a good show. The story maintains a high level of suspense as the film maker causes the audience to wonder how well Mr. Nixon will play his role. Will Mr. Nixon be a dramatic flop who drives away the audience or will he rise to the occasion and thereby help the show achieve high ratings. Whatever the case, this movie admonishes the audience to great take care not to confuse journalism with showmanship and as such anything that Richard Nixon said has to be taken with the biggest grain of salt. After all, for $600,000 a public figure, even a disgraced public figure, might come out of hiding and say just about anything. Nevertheless this is an excellent movie. It offers interesting and engaging portrayals of the two main characters, Frost and Nixon. Frank Langella's resemblance to Richard Nixon is uncanny. The movie also highlights the ludicrous hypocrisy of the pre-interview grandstanding engaged by Frost as he shamelessly hypes up his project to attract an audience. Frost's effort to sell the interviews to networks and sponsors underscores the theatrical nature of the project. Remember: Richard Nixon was PAID to perform, and he gave an excellent performance worthy of a truly gifted actor. Whether Nixon was being candid with Frost is of course another question.",9,1,3,27 December 2008
Walk the Line," Unflattering portrayal of a music legend. Then again, any movie that features a pretty lady who plays the autoharp can't be bad.
","Any movie that features a pretty lady (Ms. Reese Witherspoon) who sings dances and plays an autoharp can't be bad. I'm changing my rating of this movie to 9.Once again, Hollywood offers another slanted and distorted movie bio of a public figure, this time Johnny Cash, focusing on his personal problems for the sake of grabbing the audience's attention. Yes, Johnny Cash had a lot of personal problems - early in his life. Okay ... so what? Why focus on that? Why not focus instead on the fact that he was a U.S. Air Force veteran? Or that he was one of the most brilliant pop song writers in American music history? Or that for much of his professional life he was a social activist? Or that he got his substance abuse problem under control? The story of Johnny Cash is more than he had a substance abuse problem. The story of Johnny Cash is what he accomplished despite the substance abuse problem.This movie offers an unflattering yet interesting portrayal of one of the most gifted popular musical artists in American history, Johnny Cash. The portrayal is unflattering because it shows Mr. Cash as being a self-centered, pill-popping, emotionally fragile philanderer who neglects his family and almost wrecks his career. But the movie also provides an interesting and engaging portrayal of a gifted musical artist who became an musical icon in his own time. The movie's suggestion that Mr. Cash had to overcome adversity to achieve success is unconvincing. Although he came from poverty, Mr. Cash's background was not one of deprivation. According to the movie, Mr. Cash's father was judgmental and overbearing, but so what? What the storyline lacks, however, is more than made up for by the music, and this involves an outstanding performance by Jaoquin Phoenix who in this movie IS Johnny Cash. Indeed, Mr. Phoenix's uncanny portrayal of the musical legend is akin to that of Fay Dunaway's amazing portrayal of Joan Crawford in 'Mommy Dearest.' Also, Reese Witherspoon offers a strong performance as June Carter. What makes their performances even more remarkable is that neither one are known for being musical artists. Yet they sing, play musical instruments and are quite good. How many movies portray anyone playing an auto-harp? This movie is proof that when actors are given the opportunity, they can reveal a wide range of artistic talents that they otherwise would not be called upon to perform. His personal life notwithstanding, Johnny Cash was a great performer and for that reason alone this movie is worth watching.",9,0,2,22 November 2005
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Since when is Mr. Holmes a cartoon character?
","Sometimes one watches a movie and weeps because the story is so strong and compelling that it evokes a cathartic experience. And then there are movies that cause the eyelids to grow heavy and the mind to wander off to slumber land. This movie is in the latter category. Sherlock Holmes is not a cartoon character, yet this movie not only transforms Mr. Holmes into a cartoon character, he is a cross between Daffy Duck and James Bond. Not surprisingly, the movie provokes some unintended (or maybe intended) laughter, but with a ridiculous story that brings new meaning to the word contrived, there is little that can save this movie from DVD land where it belongs. Robert Downey and Jude Law give it a try, but their efforts are for naught. Sometimees the current is just too strong. The story is simply too implausible and the special effects too gratuitous. Okay, tastes change and maybe the producers are playing to a certain audience. But one thing that does not change is quality, and in this respect the movie could have been better.",5,17,32,27 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," A remake of a remake and shows it.
","FIrst, Edward Norton is no Bill Bixby and second, how many 'Hulks' does this movie need? This movie has several glaring weaknesses: first, the acting is laughable. Tim Roth must be considered as a candidate for the worst actor award for 2008. Second, the story is simplistic. Man is sick, man gets angry, man becomes a monster. Duh. Third, the special effects are almost cartoonish. Is this movie actually a cartoon interspersed with live acting? This confusion of style is now typical of most Hollywood action/sci-fi movies. Fourth, little character development. The characters are two-dimensional facsimiles directly out of the Hollywood potboiler mold. Liv Tyler's performance is utterly flat. It's not her fault; it's the material she has to work with. Betty Davis and Joan Crawford probably would have fared little better, but at least they would have given the role a little more flare. This movie is a remake of a remake and shows it, a really empty vessel. No originality. Intellectually empty. A huge Hollywood fx extravaganza that, like all the celluloid garbage that has preceded it, will eventually find its way to DVD land and oblivion.",4,3,7,16 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Bland movie telling an important story.
","The movie deserves an A for effort but misses the mark dramatically. The question is: why? The story is evocative and the cast is excellent. Where the movie goes wrong is how it presents the story. The movie attempts to inject a whimsical element in story which is out of context. There was nothing whimsical about the plan to save priceless artwork. Also, the story moves at a slow pace and inspires little if any excitement or drama. The discoveries of the hidden artwork has little dramatic impact, nor do the interpersonal relationships between the characters which in the movie are shallow. Even the attempt at romance comes off as tepid and half-hearted, as well as implausible. The idea of a young, handsome, married American officer, alone in Paris, having dinner in the apartment of an attractive, intelligent, single French woman who made him dinner and not staying for at least another drink is a stretch. True, he is married and his faithfulness is commendable, but still .... The movie does have some strong dramatic moments, but in general the story is bland. Yet despite the movie's drawbacks, it still manages to tell a story about an historical event of great importance and significance, and for that reason alone is worth watching.",Null,121,163,7 February 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Surprsingly good movie
","I had misgivings about going to watch this movie. I believed that this movie would be just more of the same special-effects digital garbage that Hollywood is dishing out faster than a short-order cook dishes out hash at a busy diner. The good news is that although this movie is packed with special effects, IT'S NOT GARBAGE. This movie is actually watchable, and contains some pretty good acting in a movie that is not overly insulting to one's intelligence. In other words, the movie entertains without being a mere live-action cartoon. Now this movie isn't Shakespeare and Tom Cruise is not Sir Laurence Olivier, so if you're expecting something esoteric or sublime, this is the wrong movie. But if you want an action movie and are willing to accept the movie on its own terms, then this movie is worth watching.",7,0,1,13 May 2006
The Finest Hours," Excellent movie. Bring your life jacket.
","This is a great movie. Tense story, excellent acting, lots of action and an upbeat theme. The movie keeps the audience engaged and entertains. Now one might write off this movie as being just the latest addition to the natural disaster movie genre but that would be only partially correct. There is little in the story that is contrived. That is, the story has plausibility. It does not seem to be stretching literary license (though some is taken). The heroics are not overblown. Actually, what is depicted is amazing and admirable. Coast Guardsmen conduct a rescue operation in almost impossibly abysmal conditions. Yet it happened. You can look it up. The movie does raise a question: why was the US Coast Guard so undermanned and poorly equipped? This movie gives cause to compare it to the blockbuster Titanic (1997). It compares favorably. Chris Pine and Casey Affleck are excellent as the two principal characters who are most responsible for saving a lot of lives. This movie is worth watching. Just make sure that you're wearing a life jacket.",10,2,7,16 February 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Excellent movie. Kudos for Russell Crowe and company
","For a remake of a movie that was made fifty years ago, this is an excellent movie. Usually remakes are lemons. Not so with this one. This is an excellent movie, with great acting, solid script and beautiful cinematography. Russell Crowe once again proves that he is one of the great actors and the rest of the cast give great performances too, especially Ben Foster and Peter Fonda. Now regarding Mr. Fonda, his presence improves any movie. What a wonderful actor. But what raises this movie to a higher level is the story, which is part High Noon and part Good,Bad,Ugly. Tuco would have been at home in this movie. If you like well-acted, well-scripted movies, then this movie is for you.",10,1,3,22 September 2007
The Sound of Music," Historical Revisionism Masked as a Musical
","Recently I had an opportunity to watch 'The Sound of Music' and within minutes I was wondering: 'Why am I watching this movie?' This movie is corny, contrived, and deals with a story that not only I could not relate to, I couldn't care less what happened to the characters. When a movie suggests that non-Jewish Austrians were also victims of the Nazis, then that movie loses all credibility. The fact is that the Jews were the special targets of Nazi rage; other groups at least had the choice of conforming to avoid being targeted. The Jews did not have that choice. It's too bad the Von Trapps had it rough, but that's because they made it rough on themselves. And by the way, who told the Austrians to invite the Germans into their country? The Austrians welcomed Hitler as their savior and salvation. That is a matter of historical fact. So please don't tell me about an Austrian family that has to flee Austria, and is singing their way through the movie in the process. The Jews in Austria had to get out and so I can understand a movie about, let's say, a Jewish family having to flee for their lives. But a non-Jewish Austrian family, in which the father is a naval officer, having to flee? That's really missing the mark for gaining any kind of empathetic response. And although the musical numbers are catchy, they do not suffice to rescue this movie from the corniness that renders it suitable only for young children who want to learn catchy songs. But if you want to learn what really happened in Austria in 1938, and how Austria openly embraced Nazism, read any credible book on European history during the inter-war years, or better yet, read up on the life and times of three well-known Austrians associated with World War Two - Adolf Eichmann, Adolf Hitler and Kurt Waldheim - and then tell me about the 'plight' of the Austrians. Indeed, one can only wonder what J. S. Bach or J. Strauss would have thought if they had been around to witness their country's pitiful decline.",4,11,37,1 August 2005
The Expendables 2," He's back.
","This is a solid action movie. It has lots of action, a good story, good acting and some snappy dialog. Sylvester Stallone plays the lead role with a combination of power and warmth and the rest of the cast is excellent too. The rapport between Mr. Stallone and Jason Statham is excellent; they make an effective action team. It was surprising to find Jean-Claude Vandam playing out of character, in this case, a despicable villain, but his performance is excellent. The presence of Arnold Schwarzeneggar, Bruce Willis and Chuck Norris also helps to make this movie a good entertaining experience. But ultimately, the reason why this movie succeeds is because instead of relying exclusively on flashy special effects and intense action sequences, the movie tells a story without which the movie would just be a lot of noise.",8,1,9,8 September 2012
Source Code," An intriguing movie but has its flaws.
","Beware of the movie that relies too much on flashbacks. Such movies usually lose their continuity as the audience is asked to re-watch scenes that have already been shown. A good movie is one in which the story movies forward. Flashbacks can actually assist in this process, but only to a point. And when the flashbacks further include material that are intended to mislead or confuse, like personality switches or the reworking of scenes already shown, the results can be a confusing mess, which is the case in this movie. This would like making a movie like, for instance, Gone With The Wind, but instead of opening the movie at the beginning with Scarlet entertaining her suitors and then proceeding form there, the movie opens with Rhett leaving Scarlett followed by a series of flashbacks revealing in bits and pieces what went wrong to try to keep the audience guessing. GWTW is not a sci-fi movie, yet the principal is the same. The movie offers an intriguing idea and tries to make a go of it, but it bogs down and it doesn't take much effort to connect the dots. By the third flashback it's obvious that the main character is being used for something and is not too happy about it.",6,0,0,15 April 2011
The Hangover," Amusing
","This is a good movie, not great, but good. The movie has an offbeat story with an interesting twist, almost like a whodunit except that here it's a 'what happened.' Although the story has its amusing moments, it is not uproariously funny. Actually, the movie worked better when showing how three fellows are following up on all kinds of strange and weird clues to figure out what happened to them. There is a lot of slap stick, reminiscent of The Three Stooges, and if you like the Three Stooges style of comedy, then this movie will make you laugh. The funniest character is the Chinese guy played by Ken Jeong whose acting is definitely over the top and is a scene stealer. The three lead characters are amusing but do not come close to generating anything approximating a real loud guffaw. The best part of the movie are the end credits, which says something about the celluloid that preceded it.",7,0,2,18 June 2009
Iron Man 3," Mediocrity abounds.
","This movie has lots of special effects and lots of noise and lots of excellent actors, but it forgot to include one thing: a story. Well, actually, there is a story, of sorts, but it is so superficial as to render it moot. This movie is proof that special effects alone do not make for a good movie, or for even a fair movie. When Miss Penny has to bail out Iron Man, that's a sure sign that the script department is desperate. But that aside, the story is so shallow and the bad guys so predictable that the movie loses dramatic power, rendering it stale. Of course, this can happen when a comic book story is transposed onto the screen. If not portrayed correctly, the story will not be taken seriously, and the movie tanks. Iron Man 1 and 2 managed to avoid that problem; this movie does not. As a result, we have an Iron Man who offers nothing new and is dealing with bad guys who are laughable. Ben Kingsley's performance is a joke. Robert Downey Jr. is, as usual, excellent as Iron Man, but without a viable script, his presence cannot save this movie from its mediocrity, and who wants to watch mediocrity?",6,139,278,11 May 2013
Marie Antoinette," Superficial treatment of a major figure in history.
","Kirsten Dunst looks wonderful as Marie Antoinette. However, the same adjective cannot be applied to the movie. The movie provides a sympathetic portrayal of the queen, but the attempt comes off as superficial and contrived. Although as a person Marie was essentially innocuous, it was the office into which she was placed that proved her undoing. The movie fails to drive home how she was perceived as a symbol of oppression and decadence. She was not loved. In fact, she was loathed and the target of unending gossip. Whether she deserved such shoddy treatment is debatable. But the movie gives cause to feel amazement at how such a shallow person could generate so much popular ill-will. She was neither brilliant, nor clever, nor had any special talents that set her apart. Yet, she became the center of a political storm, which guaranteed her place in history. This, however, the movie fails to develop as a central theme. That is, the movie fails to portray Marie in a broader historical context. Hence, the movie is flat, lacking in drama, and even becomes trite, which, given the momentous events that were happening in France, is really amazing. The movie provides few clues as to why the people are so angry at their queen, which is the critical factor in how Marie's life ended. The movie effectively depicts Marie's lack of preparation for the role to which she had been assigned, but then basically glosses over the ensuing years of her life. Marie became a symbol of scorn. This point the movie skirts. The movie also fails to convey the sense of tragedy associated with Marie's life. It could be argued that she was fated, a victim of circumstances. The movie does not explore that theme. Instead, what the movie offers is a glib and superficial dramatization of one of the major figures in European history, whose presence helped trigger a revolution that changed France and the world.",7,0,1,19 May 2014
Spartacus," Tragic story.
","An illiterate non-Roman slave almost defeats the best armies Rome has at her disposal. The same slave, before his 'break out,' shares his cell with a naked female slave, in full view of his Roman guards. And a Roman general has some kind of relationship with his male slave - in a swimming pool. Now, what does all this have in common? Answer: I don't know! It's all in the movie, however. I don't care about Spartacus's love life nor do I care about whether the Roman general had a special relationship with his male slave. The story is about the revolt itself, which is one of the most famous slave revolts in history. It's about an army of slaves who are fighting for their freedom. But that's not enough material for Hollywood, so here comes the sex, as if that had any bearing on the revolt itself. Kirk Douglas offers a powerful, albeit somewhat hammy performance as the heroic Spartacus and Tony Curtis offers an interesting portrayal as the Greek slave who is Spartacus's adviser, friend and scribe - and his master's lover. Okay, Spartacus rebelled against Rome, but was it really necessary for Rome to crucify thousands of men just to find Spartacus? That is truly tragic.",8,0,1,11 December 2005
Casablanca," Don't make a remake!
","There's a saying: 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.' This saying is especially applicable to this movie. This movie is a timeless classic, which stands alone and cannot be replicated. I know that countless words have been written about this movie, so anything I say will probably be nothing new, but I'll say it anyway. This movie could have easily become some kind of corny and phony contrivance about some ex-patriot loser who is wallowing in self-pity because some woman led him on and then gave him the old 'heave-ho.' This movie could have easily become little more than just another World War Two movie, with the good guys vs the bad guys, with the latter getting everything they deserve. But this movie goes way beyond that, and is a work of art. Now this may sound like a cliché, but it isn't. This movie actually conveys a story that is both complex and compelling and contains some really great acting which transforms the script into something that the audience can actually listen to and follow without trying to figure out what's going on. Many of the characters in this movie are intrinsically unattractive and unlikable, but when mixed together, they emerge as some of the most memorable characters in the history of American cinema. I won't rehash this movie because anyone who knows cinema has undoubtedly already seen it. But suffice it to say, this movie is one-of-a-kind and should be treated as such.",10,2,3,15 September 2005
Training Day," Police officer goes bad -
","If you are a cynic and desperately need to find a movie that will confirm your cynicism, then this is the movie for you. This movie offers a frank and graphic portrayal of a corrupt police officer. The police officer in question, played magnificently by Denzel Washington, is both a terrifying and pathetic character because he is a man who projects a facade of strength which is a caricature of the social misfits who abound in his universe. For the Denzel Washington character, rules of ethical conduct are utterly meaningless and are to be ridiculed and ignored. The problem with this movie is that it glorifies the corrupt cop who is portrayed as being tough and all-knowing when in fact his thinking and perceptions are completely distorted. Accordingly, his behavior becomes maladaptive and can lead only to disaster. As a result, he is ruined, both as a police officer and a man. Sad.",7,1,12,11 December 2005
Chinatown," There is no justice.
","Chinatown is an excellent movie. It earned eleven Academy Award nominations and is still discussed almost with reverence decades after its initial release. Such acclaim gives cause to comment on the person most popularly associated with creating the movie – the director, Roman Polanski. Polanski is a controversial figure. But then, the same can also be said for the character in Chinatown, Noah Cross. In the movie Cross, a sexual deviant and predator, and someone who is obviously troubled and disturbed, goes unpunished. That an injustice has occurred is undeniable. Even the hard-boiled detective in the movie who investigates Cross is shocked. The theme: there is no justice.",10,2,3,7 May 2014
Gravity," Accidents happen, even in space.
","The problem with this movie is the story. It is contrived. It is also an amalgam of two other movies: Alien, directed by Ridley Scott, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick. The movie should be complemented for drawing on the work of two such illustrious directors. Now, the movie is well-crafted, meaning that is well made: excellent cinematography, good attention to details, good continuity and above all a strong performance by Sandra Bullock, who saves this movie from hokeydom. Although she does not achieve the level of dramatic tension attained by Sigourney Weaver in Alien, her performance nonetheless is worthy of positive note. Basically, this is Bullock's movie; George Clooney plays a supportive role. Actually, this movie may have worked better if it had featured Bullock alone, floating in space, trying to survive. One thing about Sandra Bullock: it is hard to dislike her screen presence in any of her movies. The story though is so predictable. Accidents happen, even in space, and this movie includes some spectacular shots of things blowing up and falling apart and burning up. So for a CG person, this movie is wonderful. Maybe the story would have been even stronger if it had contained no dialog whatsoever, just a human being, man or woman, trapped in a space suit hundreds of miles above the earth. If anyone decides to make that movie - remember you got the idea from pwnycny.",8,2,4,15 October 2013
The Death of Stalin," Surprisingly entertaining treatment of a serious event.
","This movie is a surprise. Steve Buscemi as Nikita Khrushchev dominates this movie. Although the story is about a group of men vying to fill a power vacuum left by the death of Stalin, what it comes down to is a contest between two men: Khrushchev and Lavrenti Beria. Whoever can gain control of the Politburo will win the battle and therefore power Although we already know from the history who won, the story nevertheless is engaging. It dramatizes the all the maneuvering that goes on, capturing the essential banality of the process and the shallowness of the contestants in the process. The movie does deviate from the some historical facts, yet still accurately depicts the dynamics that produced a transfer of power. The entire cast is wonderful. They play their respective roles well, this made more remarkable that none of the actors are Russian. Excellent movie.",10,0,0,20 February 2019
The Big Lebowski," David Huddleston's greatest movie.
","This movie is a cinematic masterpiece. It is excellent in all facets of the production. Jeff Bridge and John Goodman are absolutely wonderful in this offbeat yet engaging story about a man who is caught up in a case of mistaken identity. However, the actor who deserves special praise is David Huddleston who gives one of the more memorable performances as the guy who causes all the problems. In addition to the excellent cinematography, this movie is a tribute to the bowling alley and perhaps to all the humdrum places that we often take for granted. After all, how often has a bowling alley been used as a setting for comedy or drama? Yet, in this movie, that concept works. After all, where else would you expect to find a dude who likes Creedence Clearwater revival and drives a beat up car? Julianne Moore is great too in this movie as is the rest of the cast. This movie is a definite must watch for everyone who likes high quality entertainment.",Null,1,3,11 October 2010
Star Trek," What a circus! A sappy distortion of the original Star Trek story.
","Mr. Spock, where are you when we need you because you definitely are not in this movie. And as for Captain Kirk, a heroic if somewhat temperamental character has now been reduced to a mere caricature of a caricature, except this new caricature is so dumb that it baffles the mind as to how anyone could actually believe that such a dolt could be passed off as a hero. In this blotted version of Star Trek, the ship has been transformed into a glossy and poorly run whinery. Yes ... WHINERY ... that is a place where everyone whines. The complaining never stops. What do they want? They have good jobs, rank, authority, and are millions of light years away from headquarters and sanity. Their problem is that they pick a fight with a much stronger, tougher, smarter and better organized opponent who has a legitimate gripe against the Federation, particularly Mr. Spock who undergoes some kind of time warp schism that defies every known and probably every unknown law of physics, not to mention common sense. But what is even worse, the movie isn't even campy, it's just plain dumb. The USS Enterprise would not have last five seconds against the Alien or Predator. Darth Vader would have had a field day against Kirk and company. Ming the Merciless would have made short shrift out of the hapless crew from the Federation. Starship Troopers would have put the Enterprise in mothballs. If a spacecraft is capable of demolishing a planet, then why would anyone believe that a starship could defeat that spacecraft? This movie defies all logic as it asks the audience to believe what is patently absurd, such as the Enterprise being able to destroy a planet killer or the scene in which Mr. Spock is having a conversation with himself. No, not talking to himself, rather talking WITH himself, the same person, two bodies. Move over Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. The producers of Star Trek have discovered new laws of physics. This is not to suggest, however, that the movie is all bad. Far from from it. Although muddled, the story does move at a rapid pace, with lots of special effects, lots of noise, lots of fighting, with things blowing up, planets being sucked dry, some good dialogue, a solid performance by Zachary Quinto as Mister Spock (the younger), a stabilizing presence by Leonard Nimoy as Mister Spock (the older), and strong performance by Eric Bana as the bad guy, who, if this movie had a credible story, would have whipped Kirk and Spock's butts in about ten seconds (but then there would have been no movie). But the most yucky feature of this sappy distortion of the original Star Trek story is the love relationship between the half-human Mister Spock, who has a whole bunch of personal problems so acute that it would have even made the most insensitive dolt think twice before having anything to do with him, and Ms. Uhuru who looks and acts like a teenage girl. Ms. Uhuru: News Flash! Mister Spock is a wreck! Also, whatever happened to those vaunted shields that in the television show always protected the ship from harm? In this movie the shields are about as effective as paper-mache as the Enterprise is strafed, bombed, rocketed, smashed, tossed, toppled, and shaken like a baby's toy. Rarely, if ever, in the annals of Hollywood movies has a hero spaceship been more beat up. By any standard of movie story telling, the Enterprise should have ceased to exist. Indeed, the Enterprise should have disappeared after its very first encounter with the bad guy ship, so outclassed was it in terms of size, firepower and intelligence. And who could figure out exactly who was the Captain? There was constant bickering over who was in command. First Pike, then Spock, then Kirk, then back to Pike. What a circus! This movie was more reminiscent of McHale's Navy or F Troop. The Enterprise would have done better with Captain Parmenter, Sergeant O'Rourke and Corporal Agarn in command, or better yet, Captain Wally Binghamton and Ensign Charles Parker. Now THEY were the type of hapless Hollywood buffoons who would have fit in perfectly in this sfx-laden, pompous piece of celluloid which is called Star Trek.An afterword: Two of the more annoying characters in this movie are Doctor McCoy and Engineer Scotty. It is highly doubtful that there are any two characters in any Hollywood movie that are more whiny and shrill-sounding than these two nincompoops. Now, in the TV series, these characters are temperamental but not stupid. However, this movie makes them temperamental AND stupid. They make the late Lou Costello sound like Clark Gable. In fact, this movie would have worked much better if the actual Bud and Lou had played Kirk and Spock.In this movie, The Enterprise fighting the bad guy space ship would be like a badly sailed row boat going up against the largest aircraft carrier in the world, commanded by a crew of highly motivated, well-organized, merciless fanatics and bristling with planes, rockets and other highly lethal weapons, and the row boat not only winning but completely obliterating the aircraft carrier. Duh! ... Duh! ... DUH!!!!!!Actually, this movie might have worked better if Spock and Kirk became the bad guys, playing disgruntled renegade Star Fleet officers who steal the Enterprise, convert it into a pirate ship and then try to shake down the entire Federation, threatening to destroy the universe with a secret, but unnamed, super weapon, that can make a real mess of everything. One other point: for a Vulcan, Spock is a disappointment. In this movie he is more skittish than a young teenage girl on the eve of her first prom with her first date. Spock, Kirk, Uhuru, the whole bunch of them, are so laughable that it gives one cause to believe that maybe this movie was supposed to be a comedy.",4,16,26,9 May 2009
Fury," Brutalizing effects of war.
","In terms of sheer dramatic intensity, this is an excellent movie. The movie explicitly depicts the brutality of war. In doing so, the movie takes certain literary licenses. First, the movie shows US Army soldiers committing war crimes, specifically the murder of prisoners of war and wanton acts of looting and plundering. The movie also depicts US Army soldiers as being intoxicated, both in and outside of battle, and fraternizing with the enemy. The movie also shows US Army units planning highly risky operations relying on only the flimsiest of intelligence regarding the disposition of the opposing forces who, even at this late stage of the war, are still formidable. Nevertheless, the five principal characters, the crew of the tank, are treated with reverence, and deservedly so. Although isolated, they remain at their post to complete the mission. The heroism of the US soldiers in the European Theatre of Operation is an established historical fact. This movie is a testament to that heroism. Brad Pitt gives a compelling performance as the tank commander Sgt. Collier who so closely identifies with war that he cannot separate himself from the instrument, in this case a tank, through which he acts out his violence. The rest of the cast is also excellent, but this is Pitts' movie and in this movie he is the star.",10,14,30,21 October 2014
Citizen Kane," Remarkable movie.
","This movie is an expressionist interpretation of a story that, if told conventionally, would be flat. The story is expressionist because it is told from the point of view of the reporter who is trying to piece together the pieces of a puzzle regarding the life of Charles Foster Kane. The only clue the reporter has is the last word that Kane utters before he dies; it is that word that may hold the key to revealing the real Charles Foster Kane. Kane's public persona is a sham covering up a personality that is an enigma. The movie consists of a series of flashbacks as told by the people who were closest to Kane, and who despised him the most. The depicts Kane's life as a series of montages, with wide-angled and close-ups rapidly interspersed, depending on what feeling the movie is trying to evoke, all of which together convey the impression of a jumbled life in which the pieces don't quite fit together. At the start, Kane is young, dynamic, and determined to make things happen; by the end, he is defeated, deflated and behaving like a child. He is angry by the way he was rejected by his parents and has contempt for money, which he associates with the banker-guardian who Kane despises. Kane dedicates his life to spending as much money as he can, and in doing whatever it takes to maintain control, including building a palace and housing it with as many artifacts as he can buy as a way of insulating himself from a world which he finds hostile to him. Kane's life goes into a tailspin after he is caught cheating on his wife, destroying his reputation and revealing him as being a hypocrite. His second marriage, to his mistress, is also a disaster as Kane bullies her into becoming an opera singer just to prove to the world that he had in fact married a singer. He tries to buy her love and when she leaves him, he completely falls apart, utterly alone and unloved, having driven away the last person who had still cared for him. To suggest that Kane deliberately and maliciously used people would not be entirely correct. He was driven to act by psychological forces that distorted his ability to get close with people and ultimately led to his demise. As for the word rosebud, the reported never finds out what that word meant, but the meaning is revealed to the audience, leaving the audience knowing something that the reporter does not know. Citizen Kane is a remarkable movie. It has withstood the test of time, meaning that the movie is not dated and presents a story that would resonant with today's audience, in fact even more so that when the movie was first released in 1941. The acting is great and the cinematography is astounding. Who really was Charles Foster Kane? He had so much money and was known as a man of the people yet was alone. The acting is great. Dorothy Comingore's performance is especially powerful. Her role is the key to the movie. Actually this movie could have more aptly been titled Mrs. Citizen Kane because of the central role of Ms. Comingore's character. The story is as much about her as about Kane. The movie is timeless, its themes universal and contains performances that cover the gamut of human emotions.",10,4,6,21 October 2007
Darkest Hour," Churchill as hero.
","This movie contains lots of stagy acting with character depictions that approach the brink of caricature. Gary Oldham's portrayal of Churchill is especially cheesy. Nevertheless, this movie includes some powerfully dramatic scenes showing Churchill's self-doubts and indecisiveness over whether to negotiate with Hitler. Those familiar with the history of World War Two know how Churchill resolves this dilemma, but for those less familiar with the history, the theatrics contain much drama. Will he or won't he cave in? Will Britain become another France? To find out the answer, read a history book about the period or watch the movie. Either way, you will learn something interesting.",8,0,3,18 April 2018
Monster," Excellent acting.
","First, let me make it perfectly clear - I found this movie to be well acted and fascinating. I certainly recommend it as a interesting dramatization of the the life of a very disturbed person. Yet, let us not forget for a moment that the woman in question was a serial killer who was not only a victim but a victimizer as well, who committed vicious acts of violence that went way beyond any rational explanation for what she did or why. Ms. Charlize Theron's performance was incredibly powerful and poignant, as she portrays a woman whose unrequited quest for love and never-ending rejection of her by society is transformed into an all-consuming and uncontrollable rage. Normally, such a character would not evoke feelings of sympathy, but Ms. Theron manages to do so. It's a remarkable piece of acting. But, please, just remember that it's only a movie, and the movie is a drama that offers a story that may not be consistent with the facts.",8,1,1,10 October 2005
The Birth of a Nation," Epic movie with glaring flaws.
","This movie is actually two separate movies under one title, the first dealing with the Civil War itself and the second with Reconstruction. Also, the movie's title is misleading. The title should have been A Nation Reborn or A Nation Torn Asunder. Part 1 is vastly superior to part 2. Unlike part 2, part 1 of Birth of a Nation is powerful and compelling work of cinema. This movie lays out a coherent and plausible story involving two families who serve as metaphors for the North and South. Moreover,this movie effectively portrays the the carnage and chaos of war (e.g.,the sacking of Piedmont and the Cameron home; the intense battle scenes; the burning of Atlanta) and the loss suffered by the families in what is a senseless struggle (e.g., Mrs. Cameron losing two sons) as well as the graphic and historically accurate depiction of the assassination of Presdient Lincoln and the subsequent political consequences in terms of North-South relations. Also impressive was the acting of Lillian Gish, who plays Elsie Stoneman, and Josephine Crowell, who play Mrs. Cameron. Both give performances that epitomize what women were going through on the home fronts. There is nothing in this part of the movie that is corny or contrived. However, the movie goes off on a tangent in Part 2. The plot becomes contrived, highly melodramatic, and overtly racist, relying heavily on caricature to portray certain characters in a negative way. Blacks are portrayed in an openly offensive manner and the plot becomes muddled as the movie attempts to rewrite history. Nevertheless it still contains impressive elements: 1. Two outstanding actresses in principal roles: Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh. 2.Several spectacular exterior chase scenes. 3. Elaborate sets. 4. The story proceeds at a brisk pace, i.e., it's not boring. 5. There is an intermixing of close-up shots, wide-angle shots, and iris shots which depict the story from different perspectives. 6. The music is emotionally evocative (although at times unduly repetitive). 7. Extensive use of extras, especially in complex exterior shots. 8. Generally excellent acting (although at times stagy). 9. The cast includes African-Americans as extras (in a time when Jim Crowism was legal). It should also be noted that this movie was highly profitable, meaning that it is a product that resonated with the public and that was ranked number 44 on the AFI's list of the 100 best American movies (although it was subsequently removed from the list), meaning that the film industry itself had judged this movie to be worthy of positive recognition. However, primarily because of part 2, the movie in total ultimately fails as a work a drama. The slanted and myopic treatment of the causes of the Civil War shown in part 1and coupled with the hysterical portrayal of Reconstruction in part 2, makes the movie's story untenable and thereby undermines its strength as a drama. At best, this movie is an impressive antique of early movie making; at worst, a shameless attempt at historical revision and an appeal to racism.One other point. The Birth of a Nation is an epic. If one buys into the movie's fundamental premise, that the Civil War was an unnecessary sectional conflict instigated by abolitionists and Northern politicians whose actions lacked political legitimacy and were therefore illegal, then the plot, including the depiction of the Ku Klux Klan and the overtly racist scenes, makes sense. Some aspects of the movie are excellent, e.g, Lillian Gish and Josephine Crowell's strong, commanding performances; the depictions of the battle scenes and the burning of Atlanta; Mrs. Cameron pleading for her son's life; Colonel Cameron's return home, and President Lincoln's assassination are especially compelling. One may disagree with the movie's political premise but it would be a difficult to summarily dismiss this movie as unworthy of serious consideration as a work of cinema.",8,0,2,2 March 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Good but somewhat overblown.
","The movie is a bit long, drags in the middle and has a corny, hokey comic book story style, nevertheless the movie is good but definitely not great. Instead of an action packed movie focusing on a bunch of angry Jewish soldiers going after vicious, unrepentant Nazis, the audience is given a complex story with plots and subplots that are pursued to the point that the Basterds are almost shunted to the sidelines. There is solid acting, with Brad Pitt demonstrating a definite flair for comedy and Christopher Waltz giving a commendable performance as a suave but sinister SS colonel, but the muddled, absurd story is what keeps this movie from achieving anything approaching cinematic greatness. Solid acting coupled with a goofy story does not make for good cinema. This movie also continues the now time honored tradition of bashing Germans, which is nothing new in Hollywood cinema. Once again the Germans are portrayed as hapless buffoons. Yet despite the fact that they started and lost the war, and that it is highly tempting to mock their outrageous conduct, it is a stretch to present the Germans as bumbling fools. They might have been fools but they were far from bumbling and what they did in Word War Two was not a laughing matter. If someone wants to make a movie about inglorious basterds then make a movie about inglorious basterds and place them squarely on center stage where they belong.",7,3,10,21 August 2009
The Fan," Good story goes awry
","This movie is like a steam locomotive that starts out chugging down the tracks full throttle but then loses steam and grinds to an unceremonial halt before reaching its final destination. Also, this movie suffers from some major miscasting. In this movie Robert Deniro attempts to recreate his Travis Bickle character but alas, twenty years later, it doesn't work. Also, casting Wesley Snipes as Mr. Deniro's victim is simply unbelievable, especially after Mr. Snipes's performance in Demolition Man. If anything, their roles should have been reversed. Yet the movie does make interesting use of professional sports as a venue for portraying the dynamics associated with displaced aggression. But if you want to watch a really good crime dram/thriller that effectively incorporates a baseball park into the story, watch Experiment in Terror with Glenn Ford, Lee Remick, Martin Ross and Stephanie Powers. Now THAT was a great movie.",5,1,4,4 October 2007
Iron Man 2," Scarlet Johansson is fantastic in this movie.
","This is one of the best science fiction movies Hollywood has made in many years. The middle of the movie drags a little, but it finishes strong. Robert Downey is great but the real star is Scarlet Johansson. She is beautiful; she is fantastic; she is wonderful. Her fight scenes are incredible; her overall performance is magnificent. Also she definitely has a flair for comedy. In short, Ms. Johansson is a great performer and proves it in this movie. Ten stars for Scarlet Johansson. Mickey Rourke is also excellent as the bad guy. The cgi's add to the story. This movie is actually better than the original. The Tony Stark character is further developed and the audience learns Pepper Potts' first name. This movie is a welcome addition to the science fiction genre.

Two for the Money," Flip of a coin.
","There's a saying: 'Hope springs eternal.' And there is no movie where this saying is more aptly dramatized than in this movie. Here, the main character is a gambler who is so consumed by his obsession that he hosts his own cable TV show which offers, for a substantial fee, 'expert' advice on which football games to pick. And to conduct this business he hires football handicappers who, like stock brokers, advise their clients on which teams to pick. Now one of these handicappers is an ex-college football player who has an uncanny knack for making the right picks most of the time. Now the gambler/businessman/hustler believes that this handicapper has a special gift, when in fact IT'S PURE DUMB LUCK! But the gambler/businessman/hustler does not accept that, even when his star handicapper starts losing and losing BIG. Although the gambler/businessman/hustler projects the image of a successful businessman and TV impresario, he is nothing more than just another loser/gambler who is willing to gamble everything on a handicapper who is just another guy. Yet, what compels this gambler/businessman/hustler to believe in this guy and invest huge sums of money on this handicapper's picks is the hope, and fixed belief, that his star handicapper will pick that one big game that will bring in the dough and keep the action going.",9,4,11,25 October 2005
World War Z," This movie needed Abbott and Costello or The Three Stooges.
","There are two types of movies: those with strong endings and those with weak endings. This movie is in the latter category. The movie starts strongly, presenting an apocalyptic picture of humanity in crisis. The cause of the problem - a disease - seems intractable and how it impacts on humans most alarming. Then the story loses steam and what has been scary becomes laughable, and the movie soon devolves into an unintended comedy. One problem is that the mysterious disease itself is too en debilitating to transform its victims into ogres. Their jerky motions and emaciated bodies create an image of illness, not horror, and soon the movie seems to be spoofing illness. After a while, the movie takes on the mantra of slapstick comedy as the people are running around frantically, going hither and yon, making lots of noise and accomplishing nothing. In some scenes, this movie more resembles a Mac Sennett production. People, some dead, others alive, colliding into one another, making all kinds of noises and gesticulations. At that point, the presence of Buster Keaton would have helped. Instead, the audience gets Brad Pitt whose character is grimly determined to set things right, and his solution is ... well, let's just say it is a novel one, even for Hollywood. The scary people, or rather non-people, after a while lose whatever scariness they project as they demonstrate a talent for dancing a jig, which one could call The Twitch, and producing an interesting array of sounds denoting an acoustical form of communication akin to that of whales. They also have protruding teeth which may offend people with dental problems, especially those with upper-bite issues. Introduce Abbott and Costello into the story and you have an amusing comedy; with the Three Stooges a comedy classic.",4,2,5,9 July 2013
The Hunger Games," This is a very good movie.
","Shocking as this may seem, this is actually a very good movie. What seems to be a contrived, half-backed plot set in some futuristic, post-apocalyptic world, is actually a substantive story. The lead actress gives a wonderful performance as a courageous teenager who is determined to survive without becoming depraved. This movie in some ways parallels the Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger, except here the characters are more nuanced and the heroine much more vulnerable, making her surviving that much more impressive and dramatically compelling. The supporting cast is excellent too and includes a composite of characters that are both amusing and repellent. The audience is kept engaged as the plot movies full speed ahead, taking the audience for a ride.",9,3,11,3 April 2012
42," This movie actually is more about Branch Rickey.
","As this movie is a remake of a remake of a remake of a remake, and is recounting a story that is so well known as to become a part of American culture and folklore, the director was confronted with the formidable challenge of reworking the story into something new. The results are mixed. The movie can be divided into two parts - a sports movie about an athlete who bucks the odds to become a hero, and a soap opera about a man's personal life off the field. The former works; the latter fizzles out. That Jackie Robinson grew up in California, served in the United States army, was already known as an athlete, and was a star in the Negro leagues is glossed over in favor of playing up Robinson's relationship with his wife, which is done in a way that can be described in one word - hokey. And it is this hokeyness that takes this movie down several notches. When Jackie has to endure being publicly humiliated by Ben Chapman, that is dramatic. When Jackie is making googly-eyes at his wife, that is cheap dramatics of the most transparent variety. Harrison Ford's performance as Branch Rickey at times approaches that of a caricature of the bombastic businessman - gruff on the outside but really warm and cuddly on the inside, which does not help improve the movie. In addition, it seems that the movie is more about Branch Rickey than about Jackie Robinson, evident by the fact that the star cast member is playing Rickey, not Robinson, who is played by a relative unknown. If any movie required a major star in the the title role, this is was the movie. The story is about the guy on the field, not the guy in the front office. The movie would have been stronger if it would have had the Robinson-Chapman relationship as the main point of the story to drive home the theme of racism, which is what drives this story. It's not about people, it's about social problem - racial injustice - as manifested in sports, and through sports, in society . Basically this movie is based on a true story but as the movie itself disclaims parts of the story have been re-worked for dramatic purposes. The movie may have worked better if the story had not been re-worked and told 'as-is' because the facts themselves unembellished tell the whole story. To find out about Jackie Robinson, it might be better to watch a documentary instead.",7,0,2,17 April 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Score one for Hollywood, and for the audience
","Amazingly, shockingly, I must admit that this is a very good movie. I was expecting a hodge-podge of special effects that would distract from some poor acting and a dumb story, but to my surprise, this is an entertaining movie. True, the movie does have certain weaknesses, such as some ridiculously garish costumes for Davy Jones and his crew and a convoluted and confusing story, but the movie is saved by strong acting on the part of the lead characters, especially Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp, and some pretty good dialogue. This movie showed that Orlando Bloom is actually a strong actor. If you like entertaining action movies, then this is the movie for you.",9,1,3,31 July 2006
Argo," It's not a documentary
","This is a good movie which probably would have been an even better movie if the story had been based on actual facts. The operation to smuggle out the six Americans was primarily a Canadian, not American, action and the lead hero was the Canadian ambassador who protected the Americans and then arranged for them to leave the country. This is not to say that the United States had no role, because it did, but contrary to the movie, it were the Canadians who took the lead. Also, the fact that the American official sent to escort the Americans was Hispanic is not even mentioned, which would have added another dimension to the story. The movie also demonizes the Iranians who are portrayed as little more than uncontrollable rabble, when in fact, what happened in 1979 was the culmination of a long series of grievances harbored by many Iranians against the United States. This does not mean that the Iranians should be excused for what they did when they stormed the embassy, which was a blatant violation of international law governing the protection of embassies, and for which the Iranian government must be held to account, but their actions must be examined within a larger historical and political context, something which the movie to its credit alludes to, but does not incorporate more fully into the story. Ben Affleck gives an excellent performance as the CIA person and the story moves forward at a brisk pace with a lot of tension and excitement; it's a good movie. But it's not a documentary.",8,56,102,16 October 2012
12 Angry Men," The jury system is far from perfect.
","If there is any movie that more plainly dramatizes the need for a major revamping of the jury system, this movie is the one. This movie dramatizes in no uncertain terms the chaotic process associated with trying to determine guilt or innocence. Instead of being impartial, the jurors are guided by their emotions and most openly admit that they really cannot determine the truth of the case. This movie completely underscores and conforms the need for a professional jury system. The present system is so messed up that now almost both prosecutors and defense attorneys will do almost just about anything to avoid a jury trial. They are the experts and they know that once a case go to a jury, anything can happen. This movie is great because the story is completely plausible. Jurors ready to fight each other; jurors who are angry, who really have no interest in deciding the case other than just to get it over with; jurors who are projecting their own emotions onto the defendant or prosecutors. In short, this movie most effectively and succinctly highlights the glaring imperfections in the system of justice that is structured in such a way as to almost guarantee that mistakes will be made, and that is because the jurors are laymen and are being asked to apply complex legal principles to cases that often hinge on circumstantial evidence. Although the cast includes major stars like Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, it's really an ensemble cast. Ed Begley gives a fantastic monologue, ranting and raving, a really classic performance. After watching this movie, one can better understand why cases are plea bargained. It has nothing to do with ensuring justice; it's just a way to avoid having to go to trial - by jury.",10,0,0,3 October 2011
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Not funny.
","Crazy, stupid, love? The middle word aptly describes this ridiculous movie. Steve Carell and the other cast members are completely unfunny in this movie that purportedly is a comedy. The story is dreary and implausible. Steve Carell's character is so unbelievable that no amount of literary license can make it plausible. When Steve Carell throws himself out of a moving car, that sets the tone for this movie. Not only is this movie not funny, the story is warped. It asks the audience to accept certain premises that are not are not only untenable but destroy whatever humor the story may contain. As a study of domestic dysfunctionality, the movie does better job, but frankly that is not supposed to be the theme of the story. There is nothing funny about a man ejecting himself from a car after he learns that his wife wants a divorce and that his life has been turned upside down. That's tragic. If someone is expecting an amusing movie, prepare to be disappointed. The same can be said if you are expecting high drama. In fact, it might be best of you wait until the movie goes to DVD land.",5,29,52,18 August 2011
Public Enemies," Good try, but no cigar.
","If John Dillinger was even half as brutal as depicted in this movie, then Johnny Depp was the wrong actor for this role. As a 1930s period piece, the movie is excellent, but that cannot be said for the story itself because the movie attempts to portray the lead character, John Dillinger, and his friends as deserving of some empathy which is entirely disingenuous. They were in fact, violent, brutal criminals who were practically asking for what they finally got. So how can one be expected to care about them? Further, Dillinger and his friends are incorrigible but there is no explanation for their aberrant behavior, leaving one to wonder why they were so violent. Not offering any explanation, the movie becomes just another cops and robbers story, but with one big difference: there are no good guys, thus depriving the audience of even that satisfaction of having somebody to root for. Johnny Depp must be given lots of credit for taking on a role that is way out of character for him, but his portrayal simply fails to project the mean-spirited, menacing nature of a man who whose very name is synonymous with crime.Although Johnny Depp is a wonderful, gifted actor, when it comes to his portrayal of John Dillinger, he is no Warren Oates.",6,0,2,10 July 2009
Elizabeth," Queen Elizabeth - one of a kind.
","Enough is enough! One day Hollywood will drop this propensity for focusing on the personal quirks of historical figures and actually focus on what they DID. The story of Elizabeth the First is way more than who she had affairs with, but what she accomplished as Queen. When decisions had to made, decisions on which the survival of her country depended, she made these decisions ... and her decisions were RIGHT! Elizabeth was never prepared or trained to rule a country. But she did the job and did it so well that to this day her name has become synonymous with leadership, accomplishment and service. Queen Elizabeth was a hero; Queen Elizabeth was great. Under her outstanding leadership Britain defeated the Spanish Armada, then the biggest naval force ever assembled. That alone warrants a movie. Elizabeth was emotional and tempestuous. That she suppresses those traits and transforms herself into the 'Virgin Queen' is fantastic. This movie is about that transformation. If you're interested in the life of Elizabeth the First, then watch this movie. But remember, it's what Elizabeth DID which is what counts.",9,0,1,27 November 2005
Balls of Fury," Laughter abounds
","There are some who may look down at this movie with disdain and dismiss it as just another lowbrow attempt to elicit cheap laughs. Well guess what? This movie does exactly that, and that's great! This is an incredibly funny movie, with goofy but likable characters, especially James Hong who plays Master Wong. James Hong gives one of the funniest performances ever. He was great. He made this movie happen. Also, Maggie Q was great. She is the next Sandra Oh. And the the goofy story line also contributes to the overall humor, and of course, one would be remiss if they did not mention the performance of Christopher Walken who once again proves that he is a great actor. His deadpan approach was absolutely perfect for this movie. If you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh, then this is the movie for you.",9,27,39,14 September 2007
127 Hours," Never travel without letting someone know.
","Given the terrifying nature of Aron Ralston's ordeal, the movie was surprisingly low key. Perhaps this was due to the fact of Mr. Ralston's recklessness which led to his mishaps or maybe the sheer senselessness of what he was doing, which seemed to be pointless, self-indulgent, and never explained in the movie. After all, nobody told him to go hiking in the middle of nowhere. Yet that is what he did, and for that he almost lost his life, which is the crux of the story. How he saves himself is amazing. Yet the moment when he finally does free himself seems almost anticlimactic, when it should have been the climax of the movie. To self-amputate a part of one's body is an act of sheer desperation that is horrifying. Although one can root for Mr. Ralston to persevere and to be saved, what cannot be ignored is the sheer recklessness of his behavior that got in that predicament in the first place. Everyone can appreciate his dilemma but it's a dilemma that he brought upon himself, which gives one cause to wonder: Why? James Franco's performance is outstanding.",8,0,2,28 January 2011
"I Love You, Man"," Mildly humorous.
",This is one of those mildly amusing but otherwise forgettable movies that tries to bring humor to an otherwise humorless subject. A guy trying to find a friend? It's not exactly a subject that provokes mirth but who knows? Everyone has different tastes for humor and apparently the producers of this movie felt that this story would cause an audience to laugh. They were wrong. The movie does succeed in inducing a few chuckles but no way does it even come close to making one guffaw. The blandness of the material is equaled only by the weakness of the acting. Paul Rudd reminds one of a second-rate Dustin Hoffman and the rest of the cast is equally insipid. But it's not their fault. Material is material and even the most inspired acting could not have saved this movie from the jaws of mediocrity where it most surely belongs.,6,4,13,21 March 2009
Creed," A great movie. It's about trying to find meaning in life.
","If you are expecting a tired worn retread of the Rocky formula, you will be pleasantly surprised, possibly even elated. This is a wonderful movie. It's about an elderly man who is living out the remainder of his life. All of his props - the money, the fame, the glory, the excitement, the action, and most importantly, his family - are gone. He's by himself. He has nothing to do with boxing, hasn't been to Micky's Gym in years; he's in quiet retirement, content to have his memories. Then someone enters his life: Apollo Creed's illegitimate son, Adonis. The movie is about him too. He is a young man in search of an identity. He doesn't want to be identified with his father. The two form a relationship, almost that of father and son, and bring meaning to each other's lives. This plot may sound corny or contrived, given that the context of the story is boxing, which is depicted in all of its ugliness and brutality. But the plot is sound and each scene intense and dramatic. Although ostensibly a sports movie, it's not about sports. It's about the human condition and about trying to find meaning in life. This is a great movie. This movie also contains Sylvester Stallone's finest performance in years, maybe in his entire career.",10,1,5,18 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Substantive story.
","The negative critiques of this movie notwithstanding, this is definitely one of the better movies of the science fiction genre. For this movie to work one must judge this movie for what it is: science fiction. Otherwise this movie will be barely watchable. Hugh Jackman gives a strong performance as Wolverine and the supporting cast led by L. Schreiber are equally good as the movie takes the audience on a wild ride through war and sibling conflict. Although based on a comic book story, the plot is sufficiently complex to actually maintain audience interest and that combined with excellent special effects raises this movie to a level that is somewhere between good and very good, and for a movie that features characters who are, to put it mildly, strange, this is saying a lot.",8,6,11,5 May 2009
Alexander," Intriguing, Though Flawed, Movie
","The movie is too long, too wordy, the script muddled, at times even ridiculous, and the special effects not particularly special. Yet, the movie has some redeeming qualities. First, it depicts, albeit in a contorted way, the life of one the most interesting and famous persons in history, Alexander the Great. Second, Colin Farrell gives a strenuous, although not entirely believable, performance, and what it lacks in quality, he makes up for it in sheer determination. Then again, maybe it was asking a bit too much from Mr. Farrell to play a Macedonian and to portray the character not so much as a conqueror but as a person in conflict, with himself, his companions and his family. Maybe the movie misses the mark by concentrating more on Alexander's personal issues and less on what he actually accomplished. For Alexander's accomplishments in and of themselves could have provided more than enough material upon which to base a drama. That Alexander is depicted as constantly bickering with his companions and even having some kind of strange relationship with his wife detracts from the fundamental premise of the movie - that Alexander was a special person who accomplished a lot in a relatively brief period of time. One should be warned that if you are expecting a documentary about Alexander, this is not the movie to watch. Nevertheless, this movie is still worth a look. It's not the greatest movie, far from it, but at least it will let you know that Alexander DID exist, that he DID conquer almost all of the known world and that what he DID still generates interest 2,500 years later.",5,1,2,27 July 2005
Troy," Better than I expected.
","When I heard that Hollywood was making an epic movie based on Homer that would star Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, I thought to myself: 'NO WAY! IT WON'T WORK!' Subsequently I watched the movie and was pleasantly surprised. The movie 'worked'; both Mr. Pitt and and Mr. Bana were quite good and the story, although greatly condensed, was still credible and watchable. In fact, this movie restored my faith in Hollywood's ability to make an epic movie that's more than just a tedious exercise in special effects. For although 'Troy' is loaded with special effects, it actually tells a story. Yes ... TELLS A STORY! So if you want to watch an epic movie with good acting and which actually tells a story, then watch this movie. By the way, this movie is also one of the great anti-war movies, and if you know the story of Helen of Troy, you will know what I mean.",8,16,28,25 August 2005
Dead Poets Society," Sad movie except for Alan Pottinger's performance.
","Mr Keating, a school teacher in a elite private school, uses his position to pursue a political agenda, namely to liberalize the school's curriculum, with tragic results. To achieve his political goals, the teacher encourages his students, all impressionable adolescents, to break the rules of the school, under the guise of promoting academic and personal freedom, and a group of his students respond by forming a secret society. These students have no idea that Mr. Keating is using them to promote strife between the faculty and student body, embarrass the school administration and thereby force change. As a result the students are placed in impossible conflictual situations that they are utterly incapable of resolving. Mr. Keating's manipulativeness is so blatantly reckless that it leads to one student committing suicide. Perhaps if Mr. Keating had communicated his concerns through appropriate administrative channels without involving the students, things would have worked out differently. But if that had happened, then there wouldn't have been a movie.One bright point in this otherwise somber movie is Alan Pottinger's high-spirited and upbeat performance as 'Bubba' the high-school jock.",7,0,5,14 December 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Ennis - the new hero
","I'm trying to figure out what is the purpose of this movie. I watched the movie and afterwards asked myself: What is this movie about? What was the director trying to prove? What new theme was Hollywood trying to exploit to make an extra buck? Two men have the hots for each other? So what? That they try to conceal it from their families and friends? What else is new? That everyone in the movie kinda knows what's going on but really don't say anything? Okay. So ... what's the point? Two pals ... who are more than just pals. One dies ... the other is left to cope with the loss, a loss that he cannot discuss with anyone because to do so will reveal the kind of relationship they had, a relationship that was considered taboo. To me, when the movie ends is when the movie should have actually begun. Usually, I don't endorse the use of flashbacks because flashbacks tend to muddle the continuity of the story, but here a flashback right at the start of the movie would have been wonderful: a middle aged man looking out of window, seemingly at nothing, but consumed by thoughts and feelings that he cannot share, that must remain within him forever. What is he thinking about? And why? Anyway, the movie is worth watching. Heath Ledger offers a great performance as a quiet man who's in conflict with himself and with society, a middle of the road rebel who must restrain his innermost feelings in order to survive in an unforgiving society that will reject him and ostracize him if he ever fully reveals his true self. Ennis is the new hero.",10,11,16,1 March 2006
The Hustler," More than just a sports movie.
","This is more than a sports movie. It is a movie about the human condition. The movie is crammed with metaphors, all of which add up to one thing: it is easy to become depraved. What starts out as a desire to win causes one to spiral downward into an abyss of moral decay which erodes one's priorities and leads to tragic consequences. Eddie Felson wants to win, but at what price? How much is he willing to hobnob with the sharks, shysters and gangsters who don't care a spit for him? For Eddie is symbol of an economic system that puts winning at any price before everything, and if anyone gets hurt along the way, then too bad for them, until of course it's too late and the damage is done. And Minnesota Fats is a symbol of what Eddie can become if he goes that route. And the pool hall itself is a symbol of a system in which people are being hustled, lured by the promise of a quick win. For Eddie, winning and losing is a matter of life and death, but for everyone else it's business as usual. Nobody seems to care about Eddie, and he becomes so craven that he rejects the only person who actually does care about him, all so he can play a game of pool and win some money and show to the world that he is the greatest - except that nobody cares. And that is the point of the movie. As Eddie leaves, life goes on, as if he was never there. He ruffles the feathers of the powers that be and it's duly noted; there will be other Eddies, and as for Eddie himself, he just another player, and a good one too, who arrives, has his moment of glory, and than disappears, with many others waiting in the wings to take his place.",10,1,3,15 July 2012
Spotlight," Solid story, well acted.
","Amazingly this is an excellent movie. It is amazing because in this day and age when Hollywood has opted to play up sensationalist glitz at the expense of substance, this movie does just the opposite. It tells a story. It does so in a straightforward manner, with no gratuitous scenes of violence or seedy sex. The story depicts a team of reporters who do a job, and do it right. They have some leads, develop their sources, collect the evidence, put it all together and publish a story. What they did took a lot of courage. Michael Keaton gives a strong performance as the leader of the team of reporters. However, it is Mark Ruffalo who emerges as the star of this movie. His performance dominates the movie. The subject of the story is controversial and sensitive. It deals with a religious institution that allows itself to become a cover for sexual perverts and then tries to cover up the mess, in the process deceiving the public. Sadly, but not surprisingly, this movie is based on a true story. That's why this movie must be watched.",10,6,11,17 November 2015
Terminator Salvation," Good, solid sci-fi movie.
","This movie is definitely one of the better of the sci-fi genre. A taut story, solid acting and good continuity makes this movie watchable. Christian Bale gives a credible performance as John Connors but the real star is Sam Worthington as the android with an identity crisis. The movie is based on a not original but still intriguing premise involving the relationship of man and machine and which of the two is superior. This theme may seem far-fetched but it's a science fiction movie and therefore should be judged as such. Although not a classic in the tradition of Frankenstein or other landmark movies, it is nonetheless an interesting and engaging movie that presents a new take on the man vs. machine theme and does this with skill.",8,3,6,30 May 2009
Concussion," The movie should have been about the players, not about a doctor.
","Potentially a great movie, except for a few problems. First, Will Smith. Smith playing a Nigerian medical doctor? No way. He is hopelessly miscast. Second, the plot: reformer versus entrenched special interest. This theme is as old as Hollywood itself. Third, the story's premise, that contact sports can cause brain trauma. No surprise there. The relationship between sports and brain trauma has long been a recognized fact. The question is: when a player begins to exhibit symptoms of neurological deterioration, is football the only cause? Also, the acting in general is stagy. Some of the dialogue, especially Will Smith's, is hokey. The relationship between the doctor and his wife melodramatic and contrived. The only parts of the story that evoke real drama are those depicting the actual players complaining about their symptoms and desperately asking for help. They should have been the principal characters in this movie. The story should have been about the players, not about the doctors and administrators engaging in academic and legalistic debates. Will Smith should have been cast as one of the players. The movie depicts a foreign-born government pathologist who never examined or treated any football players and is not even a football fan as a hero who manages to make an entire medical establishment look like a bunch of bumpkins and then goes public with his autopsy report in an attempt to embarrass the NFL. That the NFL reacted defensively should be no surprise. The doctor himself is not a damaged party. He did not play football. He was not an employee of the NFL. The involved parties were the players themselves. Instead, the movie is used to promote an anti-corporate, anti-NFL agenda.",6,4,9,28 December 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," It's Cold Outside!
","When you talk about catastrophe movies, the catastrophe has to be something that is plausible, otherwise the catastrophe becomes a joke. This is the case in this movie. This movie suggests a scenario that is so preposterous, even for a science fiction movie, that it reduces the movie to the level of a farce. When the entire northern hemisphere freezes in a few hours and a freighter winds up in the middle of Manhattan, the movie takes a turn that makes it fundamentally ridiculous. And to watch characters trudging through a blizzard reminded me of Dr. Zhivago trudging his way back to Lara, except in Zhivago's case there was actually a plausible story with which to associate Zhivago's actions. This is not to say that I did not find the special effects intriguing because I did, but special effects themselves are not enough to sustain a movie, which this movie proves. If you like cold weather this is the movie for you.",4,0,1,12 August 2005
Spider-Man 3," Shallow comic book story
","What can one say about a movie that is entirely devoid of intellectual content? Such a movie defies review because there is nothing substantive to review. All the talent, all the time, all the money and all the other creative resources that were expended to make this movie are ultimately wasted, all for nothing. Spiderman and his enemies are comic-book characters and no amount of special effects can change that fact. The characters are insipidly shallow, but what else is to be expected from a comic book story brought to the screen? That does not mean that movie can't be a moneymaker because it is a commercial product, but even compared to Superman or Batman, the movie does not contain enough intellectual content to sustain any drama. But if this is the kind of escapist fare that sells, then more power to the market place.There is one exception to the above comments. In this movie Thomas Haden Church once again proves that he is a great actor.",6,1,1,11 May 2007
Midnight in Paris," Whimsical trip through nostalgia-land.
","This movie is a whimsical fantasy that succeeds as a movie. The main character, admirably played by Owen Wilson, is on a quest for something that is a mirage, but to him is real. The movie deals with escapism and its pitfalls. Yes, it can be fun to let our imagination take us to all the beautiful places we crave to go to for happiness, but ultimately we're stuck in the present which sooner or later comes back to bite us. Nevertheless, the world of make believe can seem so real that once you're there, you never want to leave and that is the start of madness. This movie takes the audience to the brink of madness. The main character is so open to suggestion and so desperate to be appreciated and understood that he wants to flee present, which makes this movie so appealing. For who doesn't think about wanting to escape to a better place? Who doesn't daydream? The rest of the cast is excellent. As for the cinematography, the opening shots of Paris are superb. Rarely has an urban setting been more magnificently presented in a movie and for those who like Paris, this movie will be a delight to watch.",9,1,4,14 June 2011
Zodiac," Intriguing Who-done-it?
","What a surprisingly good movie. Yes, what could have been just another insipid who-done-it is a well-acted, intense movie about actual events. The movie is long, but avoids becoming overly convoluted or meandering. This movie is based on events that effected not only California but grabbed the attention of the entire nation as law enforcement struggled to solve a series of crimes that may or may not have been solved. That we don't know whether these crimes were ever actually solved is what makes this movie most intriguing. The movie's producers offer their theory. After watching this movie, you may want to come up with a theory of your own.",10,2,7,10 March 2007
Milk," A story about determination and courage.
","This movie is one of the best, if not the best, movie biopics in Hollywood history. Besides being superbly directed and well-acted, the movie tells a story about determination and the affirmation of those values that made the United States great. Although Harvey Milk is the central character of this movie, the story is about much more than Mr. Milk's political career or his tragic death. Rather, it is a statement about courage in the face of extreme adversity and for standing up to what you believe is right. Harvey Milk could have played it safe, played ball with the powers that be, cut his deals with the other politicos and in the process become just another politician. But he believed in action and meant every word he said and for that he paid the ultimate price. For a public official to take an unpopular stand takes a lot of courage and guts and Harvey Milk had both those qualities. Yet the movie also contains the negative message, that by taking an unpopular stand one puts everything on the line, including one's life. It's a fact that the movie boldly examines. The deaths of Harvey Milk and George Moscone is a dark chapter in American political history. Hopefully neither man died in vain.",10,7,22,10 December 2008
The Prestige," Tribute to Nicola Tesla

The acting is excellent and the story is original and quickly engages the audience. Also, this movie is a tribute to one of the great inventors in history, Nicola Tesla. Mr. Tesla was responsible for the introduction of alternating current and knowing that will make the movie even more entertaining. Indeed, perhaps Hollywood should make a movie about the life and career of Nicola Tesla. All the actors in this movie are excellent and offer compelling and powerful performances, especially by Hugh Jackman who proves once again that he is one of the premier actors in Hollywood today.

Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Ugh! First rate junk,
","What a dumb movie. Real junk. Hollywood at its glorious worst as comic-book characters get comic-book treatment. What else would one expect? Appealing to the lowest-common-denominator is alive and well in this movie. The plot is dumb, the acting plodding, the special effects not so special (and there's lots of them too), and the main character is a joke. Just because the main character is taken from a comic-book doesn't mean he can't be given some dignity. The good vs. evil conflict is weak, the good guys are clueless, the bad guys are travesties. Why not have Hellboy rescue inmates from a concentration camp or help defend innocent defenseless people who are victims of violence? This movie once again proves that when given the chance Hollywood will churn out mediocrity from that creative potboiler that spews out the garbage that's supposed to pass for entertainment. In addition, this movie is as long as its mediocre and to watch this movie without nodding off is a challenge. And please, what's with the opening monologue? Don't tell a story, show it!

Hotel Rwanda," What a wonderful, marvelous, inspirational movie.
","From time to time one can come across a movie that transcends the ordinary or commonplace and rises to the level of being special. This is one of those movies. The story here is not only about a man who rises above his circumstances to become truly heroic, nor only about the seemingly pointless conflict between two groups of people, but primarily is about the human condition in general. This movie challenges one to ask: Is there any hope for humanity? This movie can generate feelings of deep despair, yet it does not, and for one reason: the main character, Paul, magnificently portrayed by the excellent actor Don Cheedle. Paul convinces us that in tumultuous times when people are being cruelly mistreated and uncertainty abounds, men like Paul are there to lead, to inspire and to serve.

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," The story has some plausibility problems.
","This is a muddled story set in a time that is now history. What was relevant in 1973 is no longer the case today. If one does understand the historical context in which the story is set, this movie will fail. Also, the protagonist, played by Gary Oldham, is not the most engaging of characters and it is unclear as to why any government agency would want to request his services. It is one thing for a story to include all kinds of twists and turns, but not to the point that it becomes confusing. A who-done-it format need not be confusing. Aklso, the premise of the story is not plausible. At the highest government level a mole will stick out like the proverbial sore thumb. It's one thing to have a spy operating in some office; such a spy can maintain their cover for years. It's another thing, however, to maintain one's cover at the ministerial because at that level everybody knows everybody too well and anonymity is impossible. It would be like an assistance secretary of defense in the U. S. being a secret double agent. No way. In any event, Gary Oldham gives a strong performance as a cynical operative and John Hurt is excellent as the frustrated and angry spy master.",7,0,1,9 January 2012

True, the story is set in the It contains the cultural trappings of the old west - stagecoach, remote and desolate landscape, horses. But it's about people, namely the people depicted in this movie. They are complex and their actions intense. Thus, this is an intense movie. The story is actor-driven. This means that if the acting is not excellent, the story will fail as a work of drama. In this case, the acting is excellent and often superb. There are eight principal characters in the story. Each character has a story. Each is trying to survive and get over on the other. To find out more details, one must watch the movie. Samuel L. Jackson delivers another dominating performance. However, Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is a show stealer. She holds her own in what is otherwise a male-dominated story. The rest of cast is excellent too. If you like movies with intense stories, this movie is for you.",10,5,17,11 January 2016
Crash," Intense movie
","This has to be Sandra Bullock's finest movie. This movie marks her transition from a comic actress playing fluffy roles, to a serious actress whose performance must command respect. And this is why this movie is so great - the surprising performances. Tony Danza and Matt Dillon are wonderful in their portrayals of characters that are complex and not mere two-dimensional facsimiles of human beings. The Matt Dillon character is especially indicative of the intensity of this movie. Dillon plays an angry, bitter police officer who, despite his racist behavior and remarks, performs heroically and in the process redeems himself. For this movie is about people relating to other people on the basis of stereotypical beliefs that ultimately have no basis in fact. But the highpoint of the movie is Sandra Bullock's surprisingly compelling performance. Her character is so terrified and angry, and feeling so isolated and vulnerable, that she sinks to a depth of despair that is seemingly irreversible, yet she too survives, thus conveying a sense of hope and making this movie a powerful work of art.",10,1,7,25 July 2005

","This movie is both hilarious and chilling, hilarious because of the caricatures of real people it portrays, and the pomposity of power, and chilling because of the story's plausibility. A depraved psychopath launches a nuclear strike, putting the whole world at risk,, and the group charged with the task of heading off total destruction includes a Nazi, a warmonger, a president with no real power and drunk Soviet premier. One may dismiss such a scenario as mere literary hyperbole, but sadly, such characters do exist. When the president learns that his authority has been circumvented, he is powerless to do anything about it, revealing that the presidency itself is a sham and that there is no way to prevent a cataclysmic catastrophe. All the safeguards are revealed to be mere window dressing that are meant to lull the public into believing that a disaster could never happen. This movie includes many scenes that provoke laughter, but it is laughter that masks the truth which is that the whole world is at risk.This is a classic movie because it deals with themes that transcend time and are applicable to the human condition. This movie is about the imperfections of people and how these imperfections can create huge problems. It is also about what can happen when people engage in brinkmanship, using weapons of mass destruction as leverage. Things can spiral out of control quickly and irreversibly. Some characterize this movie as a so-called black comedy. But there is nothing funny about the story, unless one feels that caricatures of people in varying degrees of regressive personal self-destruction is amusing. This movie shows what happens when people entrusted with safeguarding the nation really don't know what they are doing and the act in bad faith to try to cover their failures. This is most apparent in the role played by George C. Scott whose performance is brilliant. He captures the essence of a senior general who is is little more than a dilettante in a uniform and has nothing to offer to resolve the crisis, of which he is partly to blame, and knows it. This movie is effective precisely because its story is so plausible, and no amount of diligence can guarantee that something awful and catastrophic can be prevented. The human factor simply defies that kind of control.",10,2,5,28 January 2012
The Bodyguard," Wonderful Movie
","Oh my, what a wonderful movie. Hollywood is known for churning out a lot of sentimental mush that's supposed to pass for romance. But, thankfully, this is not one of those movies. In this movie the main characters, the bodyguard and the lady he is hired to protect, are likable and have a relationship that develops into something really beautiful and special. Moreover, the story is plausible and the movie is well-acted too, with Whitney Houston turning in an outstanding performance reminiscent of Diana Ross's in Lady Sings the Blues (which is another great movie). If you want to watch a movie with good acting and an engaging story, then this is the movie to watch.",10,50,71,3 August 2006
Fast & Furious 6," High quality movie with lots of action.
","This is a great movie. This movie grabs and holds your attention as you go for 'fast and furious' ride with the now familiar group of guys and gals who are tough on the outside and strong and good on the inside. This is Michelle Rodriguez's best movie to date. She is a wonderful actress and delivers another great performance, and dominates her scenes. The rest of the cast is excellent too. Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson once again team up to create a lot of excitement. The story itself is great. It contains almost nonstop action interspersed with clever lines. The good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Luke Evans delivers a strong performance as the lead bad guy, Shaw. Although the story is far-fetched and stretches the boundaries of plausibility, still it works, and as a result is entertaining, and for that reason alone this movie is worth watching.",9,4,8,28 May 2013
The Expendables," Nonstop action
","Within the action movie genre, this movie has to rank at or near the top. This movie has a solid story, great acting, snappy dialog and fantastic special effects making it one of the great action movies. The movie offers nonstop action with characters who either very likable or very bad. Eric Roberts and Steve Austin are chillingly effective as the bad guys and Sylvester Stallone has never been better as the good guy. Things blow up, mayhem abounds and the action is fast and furious. Yet despite all the noise the story stays on track and remains well organized, comprehensible and interesting. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis have cameo roles that fit right into the story. There is violence but it's not gratuitous, it's integral to the story. The fight scenes are incredible. This movie probably won't be nominated for any awards and if that proves to be the case, it will be due purely to politics.",10,2,9,24 August 2010
MASH," If you like a movie that mocks soldiers stuck in the middle of a war zone, then this movie is for you.
","This movie is innovative. This movie is well-written. This movie is well-acted. But I don't like this movie. I feel this way because the Korean War is not an appropriate backdrop for a comedy, even for a comedy with an anti-war message. The United States lost over 40,000 soldiers during the Korean War. Making fun of the Army may be okay in certain circumstances, but to portray Army personnel who served in Korea as a bunch of giggling goof-offs just is not funny to me. The soldiers who served in Korea were heroes and should be accorded the respect their service deserves, even in works of fiction. Characters like Frank Burns and Margaret Hoolihan are comical in a farcical sort of way, but their antics were taking place not in the peaceful confines of some stateside army base, but in the middle of war zone where they were on-call 24-hours per day, everyday, rain or shine and everything in between. If you find that funny, then go ahead and laugh. But I don't find it amusing, not at all.",5,1,7,12 June 2006
The Way Back," Compelling though implausible story.
","Even though the story is far-fetched and indeed challenges the limits of plausibility, it's an engaging, interesting and at times dramatically powerful movie. The movie also teaches a very important lesson: Walking thousands of miles through dense forests, across deserts and over mountains, in nasty weather, can be hard on one's feet. This movie features some of the most stark close-ups of beat-up feet maybe in the history of cinema. Between Ed Harris and the young lady who plays the female escapee, there's enough foot damage to keep a team of podiatrists busy for years. Indeed, after watching this movie, one might think twice before deciding to take a walk across a desert - with no water or food - which brings up another point dramatized in this movie: Never take a 4,000-mile walk without bringing matches. At some point you'll have to make a fire, and it's not easy to make a fire in the middle of nowhere without matches. It can be done, but it takes a lot of work and you can save yourself a lot of hassle if you bring matches. Now, the soviet Gulags were deliberately placed in the middle of Siberia precisely to deter the kind of escape portrayed in this movie. Indeed, the authorities were practically inviting prisoners to try to escape and with good reasons: first, there was no place for the prisoners to flee to and second, the environment was far more punishing then the prison itself, meaning that there was probably more of an incentive for inmates to stay in the prison and try to make the best of a bad deal than to leave and be at the mercy of the forest, snow, cold and wild life. Nevertheless, the movie presents a compelling story about desperate people trying to escape to freedom, and that alone makes the movie worth watching.",9,2,6,26 January 2011
Alien," Great movie.
","With the possible exception of 'Predator' this movie is the best and most intense science fiction movie ever made in the history of Hollywood. This movie offers everything a movie should have - a great story, excellent acting, a simple yet compelling plot, empathetic characters and a creature that is merciless, frightening and loathsome. Further, this movie stands the test of time and is as watchable today as it was when it was first released in 1979. Every character in this movie has an important role and every line in the script is taut with tension as the crew of the space ship, isolated and alone in the middle of nowhere, try to figure out how to defeat a monster that seems invincible and is hunting them one-by-one. If you haven't seen this movie, see it.",10,0,1,17 November 2005
The Book Thief," A solid, well-acted movie.
","The movie is a well made but constrained story that downplays the Nazi excesses, which is the movie's problem. It does depict these excesses, but fails to convey the sense of terror associated with the Nazi regime. Then again, the story is not about the Nazis but about characters set in that time. This is not to suggest that the subject of the Nazis is whitewashed, because it is not, but rather that the style of the movie, that focuses on the characters, pushes the Nazi actions more into the background, lessening its emotional impact, which, given the history of the Nazi regime, is a hard sell. The girl who plays the title role is excellent. Her performance is warm, engaging and credible. Also, Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson give strong performances. Some of the elements of story are stagy and contrived, but so what? It's literary license. It's a movie about a young girl who witnesses all kinds of awful things and is exposed to Nazi ideology, yet, because of a loving family, maintains her goodness. That alone makes this movie worth watching.",9,4,9,12 December 2013
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Even Stephen Sondheim's music cannot salvage this movie.
","Sometimes you have to rely on your gut feelings when deciding whether or not to do something and fortunately that I did in 2007 when something inside me said: 'Don't see this move.' Wow, was my gut feeling right! Recently I watched this movie on DVD, which I checked out from a public library. This may be the worst musical ever produced by Hollywood. The story is grotesque, the acting stagy and the musical numbers forgettable. Making a musical about a mass murderer is stretching literary license a bit far. Stephen Sondheim'syrics are clever, but even his music cannot save the story. Johnny Depp plays a role that is completely out of character for him; he is not an opera singer and his role required an actor who could belt out tunes; Ms. Bonham Carter's performance is laughable; and Alan Rickman is about as chilling a character as Charlie Chaplin. What this movie needed was Judge Dredd, not Judge Turpin. What's next on the agenda? A musical about Jeffrey Dahmer or John Wayne Gacy?",1,5,9,13 January 2012
Blades of Glory," Hilarious comedy, but with a message
","This movie is hilarious. Also, this movie is a great spoof on professional sports, especially the self-centered narcissism that is the trademark of the sport establishment. Scene after scene parody the pettiness and ridiculousness of today's professional athlete and the fans who follow them. Fairplay and honest dealing are out the window as the characters in this movie do the most outrageous things to undercut and discredit their opponents and win at any cost. What makes this movie even more remarkable is that it successfully mocks the self-centered pomposity of professional sports and the phoniness that makes it difficult to take professional sports seriously anymore.Some further comments. This movie highlights the fundamental pettiness that characterizes professional sports today and how talented and highly trained athletes are reduced to the level of buffoons for purely commercial reasons. It is the buffoonery that produces the humor, but it is a buffoonery that has some basis in historical fact which calls to question the integrity of professional sports. Rivalries are nothing new in the world of sports, but the question is: why have rivalries? What ever happened to the maxim: 'It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game?'",10,3,6,24 April 2007
Horrible Bosses," A laugh-producing machine.
","This movie is hilarious. Every scene is funny. Jennifer Aniston has never been better. She is not only a great actress, she is a great comedienne too. Charlie Day gives one of the funniest performances in a Hollywood movie in years. His phone scene with Ms. Aniston is hilarious, a take off on the Doris Day - Rock Hudson romantic comedies from the 1960s. Colin Farrell and Kevin Spacey give wonderful, strong performances. They are great actors and prove it in this movie. Playing heavies, they are perfect foils for the comics in this movie. The trio of Bateman, Sudeikis and Day is the best comedy combo since Chevy Chase, Steve Martin and Martin Short in Three Amigos. If this movie doesn't make you laugh, and laugh often, then either you're sleeping or you just don't like comedies. This movie is proof that when it wants to, Hollywood can make a comedy that actually produces laughs. The story is zany, goofy and upbeat. It's a farce, a romp, and a laugh-producing machine.",9,15,28,13 July 2011
Black Mass," Intense movie.
","Why is this not a great movie? The movie plays up the wrong character. It should have played up Connolly instead of Bulger. That Connolly became corrupted is actually what this movie is about. Connolly is a detestable character. At any given moment, there are people in society committing crimes, some relatively minor and others far more serious. That's a given. Their actions have been depicted in so many movies and television shows that it is no longer novel. But an FBI agent becoming corrupted? That's a completely different, and far more dramatic, story. When that happens, the entire country is placed at risk. The FBI is supposed to be the bastion of law, the country's protector against those who pose a threat to public safety, and when that deterrent gets compromised, as happens in this movie – well, the social and political implications should be the story. The movie touches on the subject but does not develop it further, instead choosing to showcase Bulger's violence, which is depicted repeatedly and graphically throughout the movie. That the FBI provides cover for an entire criminal syndicate is alluded to but remains undeveloped. Nevertheless, this movie is good. The story is intense. The acting is powerful, and the movie grabs the audience's attention. Johnny Depp does an excellent job portraying a psychopathic killer. The performances of the rest of the cast is equally excellent, especially that of Joel Edgerton as the corrupted FBI agent.",8,5,13,25 September 2015
The Best Years of Our Lives," Intense and compelling. Kudos to Dana Andrews for an incredibly great performance.
","This is a great movie with outstanding performances by the entire cast, especially Dana Andrew's and Harold Russell's. Although released just after World War Two the movie has survived the test of time, principally because of the the nature of the story which deals with issues that are timeless in their relevancy. This movie is proof that 'they don't make 'em like that anymore.' It is hard to imagine Hollywood being able to recreate this movie today. The audience would be able to relate to the story - who couldn't?. But who'd play the roles? Could any actor today play Fred Derry without it becoming a laughable caricature of the returning war vet? Could any actor today play an Al Stephenson without coming off as being a bloated middle-aged phony? The trouble with Hollywood today is that when it tries to make a movie about a serious subject, especially one based on actual events, it usually becomes a confused jumble of special effects interspersed with inane dialogue which veers away from the actual historical event which is shunted to the background. There are exceptions. 'Forrest Gump' with Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese deals in part with the subject of returning war vets, but that is not the main theme of the movie. 'Saving Private Ryan' with Tom Hanks, Vin Diesel and Tom Sizemore must get high marks for its excellent portrayals of soldiers in combat, but this movie deals with soldiers who are still fighting, not the postwar aftermath. 'Dear Hunter' with Robert DeNiro and Christopher Walken, 'Born on the Fourth of July' with Tom Cruise and 'Coming Home' with Jon Voight and Jane Fonda, are about postwar adjustment issues and all three are very good, very powerful movies. But even these movies have certain melodramatic features that make them rather stagy, with more focus on interpersonal dysfunctionality than on the actual events that may have contributed to the problematic behavior. The closest that Hollywood comes to approaching Best Years in terms of artistic style and thematic content is 'The Men' with Marlon Brando, made in 1950. Filmed in a film-noir style, Best Years is far more subdued, far more intense, far more sophisticated, far less hysterical and therefore far more compelling than the other aforementioned movies. Anyway, go watch the movie.One other item. This movie is proof that Dana Andrews was one of the greatest actors ever in the history Hollywood. The entire movie centers around his performance as Fred Derry, a character which Mr. Andrews brings to life and which has become a symbol for all soldiers who return home.",10,8,9,4 November 2007
Battleship Potemkin," Great movie.
","I expected to watch another tepid, dull, ludicrous, poorly Soviet propaganda film and instead, to my huge surprise, I watched a great movie that contained all the elements that elevate this movie to the level of a great work of art. The story is told simply and straight-forward, has excellent acting and provides a positive portrayal of people who act to protest their mistreatment and assert their rights. It is almost unbelievable that this movie was made under the regime of Joseph Stalin because the style of the movie is distinctly un-Soviet and contains evidence of the kind of creativity not associated with the Stalinist regime. That the movie is so-called silent does not detract from its powerful story; the musical score is a masterpiece. Watch this movie.",10,0,0,10 April 2008
Taxi Driver," Dated but still worth watching.
","When this movie first came out in 1976, I found this movie to be absolutely astounding. But alas, time marches on and thirty years later this movie is a dated relic of a bygone era. The New York City of 1976 is not the New York City of 2006; indeed the same can be said for all of society. But that's not the movie's fault. Rather, in the ensuing thirty years since this movie was first released, so much has happened, and so many technological and demographic changes have occurred, that the movie is now passé. What was considered shocking then is now almost commonplace in movies today. For instance, the idea of a 13 year old girl being a prostitute certainly raised lots of eyebrows in 1976, but today would gain scant notice. Even the main character, Travis Bickle, being a Vietnam War veteran today would mean little if anything. Indeed, would a guy like Travis Bickle even be driving a taxi in New York City today? Could he even afford to live in New York? And would a guy like Sport be a pimp? Not likely. Nevertheless, this movie still provides a credible story about the effects of social isolation in an impersonal, hostile, violent, alienating and degenerate urban environment, which is the one thing that has NOT changed except for the worse, and for this reason is still worth watching.",8,0,1,19 November 2006
Shutter Island," Better than mediocre but not great.
","It's hard to knock a movie with a good ending even if the bulk of the movie stinks, which is case for this over-hyped thriller. Much of the movie is exceedingly underwhelming and at times outright boring. The gloomy sets, the hackneyed acting, the dumb dialog all combine to make the first two-thirds of this movie quite bland, the stuff that makes the eyelids feel heavy as you are sinking into slumber-land. Yet something amazing happens. The movie actually turns itself around and becomes an engaging and exciting cinematic event, marked by strong acting by Leonardo Di Caprio as his confused character struggles to unravel the riddle of his very identity. How this movie manages to avoid creative oblivion is fascinating. Somewhere, some how, the director must have realized that he had to turn this movie around to avoid flop-ville. Two problems with the movie is that the sinister characters aren't really all that sinister and that the setting, a psychiatric hospital is, well, a psychiatric hospital. One must remember that when a story is based in a hospital, drama can be taken just so far because along with the doctors and nurses who interact with patients, there is also a virtual army of clerks, housekeepers, accountants and other support staff who actually keep the hospital running. So when watching Shutter Island, one should ask: who is paying the bills, mopping the floor, dealing with account payable and receivables and maintaining the phones? They have a story too but once again it goes untold.",7,0,2,27 February 2010
Capote," Beware of counter transference - it can warp your judgment
","In this movie a writer is assigned to cover a story of an entire family brutally slaughtered by two men; the two men are apprehended, incarcerated, tried, convicted and sentenced to death. The two men committed a crime that was as senseless as it was heinous. These men deserve no special consideration or attention whatsoever, except as it relates to the horrible crime they committed. Yet the writer befriends one of the murderers - in fact the one who actually did the killing - and now has to deal with the fact that he now has an intimate relationship with a cunning and deceitful mass murderer, who is so nasty that his own sister wants nothing to do with him. The writer knows that yet he can't help himself. No matter how much he tries, he can't stop thinking about this murderer. Well, what does that say about the writer? The movie shows how the writer, who is urbane, mild-mannered, well-liked, and respected, recognizes the unacceptability of transforming this work assignment into something personal, but he simply can't help it, and now he is stuck with having to deal with the consequences for the rest of his life. For by writing an entire book about these two no-account murderers, is the writer in a way really writing about himself? Is the writer in a way condoning, glamorizing or at least excusing, what these two men did? Indeed, the writer even goes so far as to obtain legal counsel for these dangerous characters. This movie shows what happens when a professional person who is expected to maintain professional objectivity loses that objectivity and becomes enmeshed in the subject matter that he is examining. Once the boundary that separates the job from the personal is crossed, the consequences can be emotionally devastating, which is what happens to the writer as the writer, who was a successful and gifted author, never writes another book and drinks for the rest of his life.",10,2,7,10 October 2005
Ocean's Thirteen," Where's the story?
","I watched the movie. I thought about it afterward. And I asked myself, and indeed still ask: Is it me or is it the movie? What the heck is this movie about? When I can't figure out what a movie is about, then there is a problem. Maybe it's my problem, maybe it's the movie's. But that the question is even asked means that something is wrong because when a movie is good, the question NEVER comes up. This movie has to be one of the more mindless, pointless products from the Hollywood potboiler production factory. The movie tries to be sophisticated, the movie tries to be funny, but all it does is generate that short yet poignant question: SO WHAT? A bunch of guys trying to rob a Las Vegas casino, going through gyrations that are so disjointed and confusing that it defies all logic. What WAS good about this movie, however, were the performances of David Paymer and Ellen Barkin. Both demonstrated a level of comic acting that is responsible for whatever humor this movie was capable of generating. Ms. Barkin definitely has what it takes to be a wonderful comic actress and Mr. Paymer definitely should have a sitcom of his own. As for the other characters, let is be, as the song says. Go on to other projects, do other roles, may your careers prosper but please, OH PLEASE, DO NOT return to Las Vegas, except as a paying guest, because you'll just confuse the audience some more and probably put the audience to sleep, or cause them to ask questions.",4,10,20,19 June 2007
Interstellar," An attempt at epic story telling that does not quite make it.
","A long, tedious movie. It attempts to be an epic but fails. It attempts to say something profound, but the message is garbled. The movie attempts to mix jumbled pseudo-scientific dialogue with a melodramatic subplot involving a father and daughter, producing a muddled story with little dramatic power. The movie contains elements from 2001: A Space Odyssey and the Matrix, with its bombastic musical flourishes and the special effects meant to depict extra-dimensionality, all pure Hollywood. Matthew McConaughey is the principal actor; his character, Cooper, is the central figure of the story; the rest of the cast are supporting characters (their placement in the credits notwithstanding). McConaughey gives an interesting performance, which includes several scenes in which he weeps, which for a leading man is remarkable. The depiction of earth as a doomed planet is unconvincing and the plan to colonize other planets half-baked and one that tests the limits of plausibility. Being a science-fiction movie, stretching the boundaries of science for literary purposes is to be expected, but this movie asks the audience to accept certain premises that just do not make sense (e.g, acceleration of time; relationship of time to gravity; time as a material object). This movie is proof that when Hollywood attempts to deal with time warps, time holes, multi-dimensionality, relativity, and other complex scientific theories, the results can be less than optimum.",6,9,16,20 November 2014
Full Metal Jacket," Military as a sham.
","This is an excellent movie, for a while. R. Lee Ermey gives a riveting performance as the arch typical drill instructor, Sgt. Hartman. Ermey's performance should have earned him an Academy Award. In fact, it can be argued that Ermey's presence makes this movie special. Out side of that, the movie falters. Sgt. Hartman states clearly at the start that his order is weed out those who cannot hack his beloved Marine Corps. That means finding the bad apples. Yet, despite all his threats and abuse and blustering, nobody gets weeded out. The story line contains huge holes. First, regarding Gomer Pyle. Pyle fails at everything, yet Hartman does not flunk him out. Instead, he employs terror to try to get Pyle, a hapless screw up, to comply. Nothing helps, yet Pyle makes it. Boot camp has taught him only one thing: how to kill Hartman. Second, the story abruptly switches to Vietnam. The troops are cynical, demoralized and dysfunctional. They lack unit cohesion and esprit de corps. However, the story fails to explain the cause of their malaise. Joker, another bad apple from boot camp, is still in the Marines. Third, the character Animal Mother. His presence in the story is seems to make no sense, except that he is yet another bad apple that the Marines never weeded out. He's just more overtly anti-social. This entire movie depicts the military as a sham. Tell that to those who actually serve.",8,2,2,12 March 2018
Full Metal Jacket," Institutionalized brutality
","This movie has two parts: Part one is basic training, and part two is war. Although, set in during the Vietnam Era, this movie is not about the Vietnam War. It is about the dehumanizing effect of institutionalized brutality. The instrument through which the brutality is inflicted is Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played by R. Lee Ermey who delivers one of the great performances in cinema history. Sgt. Hartman is the epitome of the sadistic authority figure who represents a culture that repudiates principles of consensus and democracy in favor of instilling the urge to kill on command through the use of terror. In Sgt. Hartman's universe, the purpose of the military is not only to produce killers, but to produce killers who want to kill. The results are poor. Instead of producing well motivated soldiers who can operate effectively as a unit, Hartman's brutal methods produces grotesque caricatures of soldiers who lack any real motivation or purpose to do anything accept act out. That is, instead of being motivated, they are demoralized. Indeed, Hartman himself is killed by one of his own recruits. Ironically, he becomes a victim of his own brutality. There is a general understanding that the Vietnam War was bad for the United States and had a hugely corrupting influence on the military and more broadly on American society in general. This movie further reinforces this understanding. Sergeant Hartman is a truly bizarre character. He is a caricature of a soldier, yet he must be taken seriously. His destructiveness cannot be ignored. He is an agent of destruction. His anger is real. He is the voice of the angry American.",8,1,1,1 June 2017
The Grapes of Wrath," What happens when people trifle with nature.
","A revisiting of this movie merely confirms what is already established as fact: that this movie is great. It's grim story about people struggling to survive. That these conditions existed in the United States is a disgrace. To be thrown off the land is bad enough, but then to be humiliated compounds the injustice. The story is told in the form of semi-documentary which gives it further authenticity. The movie is about land. People own it, farm it, exploit it, divide it, fight for it, defend it, plow it, drive over it, drive through it. The people are transiting; the land stays. Tom Joad enters and Tom Joad exits; he is a metaphor for the transitory nature of existence. The only thing stable is the land. Ma Joad is trying to keep the family together but it's a losing battle. Only the will to survive gets them through. This movie is an incredibly powerful story, strongly acted, and told with candor.The Grapes of Wrath is director John Ford's homage to nature and a warning to all - that nature, in the form of rough terrain, inclement weather and immense distances, can be lethal to humans. In this movie the land is more than just mere scenery, more than just a back drop for a story, more than just a passing reference, it is an integral player, indeed it is the story itself. Briefly, the movie is about a family, the Joads of Oklahoma, who, after being evicted from their farm during the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, become homeless and, in quest of work and a more secure place to live, embark on a long journey through prairie and desert to California. For them, California is the proverbial land of milk and honey and holds for them a promise of a new and better life, much like the ancient Hebrews may have felt when they left Egypt in quest for their promised land. As the Joads travel west in the their broken-down jalopy they are dwarfed by the sheer immensity of the landscape. The movie features several panoramic vistas of the rugged western landscape, prairie and desert, geographical barriers that the Joads must surmount to reach their goal and places where they can die. For the land is not friendly and benign; instead it is a source of contention and a cause for grief, such as that visited upon the Joads as they lose their homes and possessions and are forced to migrate in order to survive. The Joads' vulnerability is further reinforced by the distances they must travel and the stress caused by the move itself. Two members of the family die while on the road and another disappears; nothing is close by. Driving many miles means having to deal with the possibility of their truck breaking down en route and becoming stuck in the middle of nowhere. And like the land itself, the people encountered by the Joads on their journey are surly and begrudging at best. The message is unmistakable. Nature can crush us at any time and must be respected for what it is, an all-encompassing, awesome, stark entity that is both life giving and deadly, especially when ignored, as the Joads learned as the 'wind' destroyed their lives, perhaps as a pay back for the way the land was abused. And when the Joads finally arrive in California, reality quickly sets in and with it comes more trouble and disappointment, all of this having to do with the land, which again poses a threat to the Joads' survival. The story ends with Tom Joad, who is in trouble with the law, shown trekking across the land and the rest of family again on the move as they continue to seek work. The foreboding mood that permeates this movie is further enhanced by the black-and-white photography that further brings out the stark emptiness and vastness of the land. This movie is a dramatic statement that warns the audience that human kind must be cognizant of the whims of nature for nature is something that cannot be ignored or trifled with. In the 1930s people did not treat the land with respect and the land responded in kind. That the Joads got caught up with that is the stuff for a dramatic story but nature itself is beyond our ability to control as so aptly shown in this movie. We build dams and they inevitably fail. We build dikes to keep out the ocean yet we still have floods. We build huge ships that sink. We build airplanes and rockets that crash. We build mighty bridges and buildings and they collapse. And in Grapes of Wrath, we farm the land and the soil turns into dust. And THAT is the story.",10,1,2,16 February 2010
Pacific Rim," The monster movie genre is alive and well.
","This is a good movie. The question is: why? The movie is loaded up with special effects, has a lot of cheesy acting, tells a ridiculous story, and in some ways is a rip off of monster movies from the past. Based on that, this movie should qualify as a bomb. Yet it is not a bomb; this movie is good because it is unpretentious. It is what it is and is so without apology. Indeed, this movie glorifies the monster movie genre; it takes it to a higher, more sublime, level. Here the director lets out all the stops and lets the debris settle where it may. The movie conveys a positive message. It is about teamwork and about how humans are able to unite to solve problems. The monsters themselves are not especially surprising. Similar types can be found in many other monster movies. But what is different is how they are treated by the humans and how the humans respond to them. Unlike other monster movies which show humans in mass panic mode, this movie portrays humans as being stalwart and in control. You know they will beat the monsters; it's just a question of how. The monsters are another problem to be solved and the humans do a great job of solving it. This movie is worth watching.",8,19,31,24 July 2013
Empire of the Sun," Wartime captivity from a young boy's perspective.
","Hollywood's treatment of the Japanese in World War Two movies is always harsh, maybe deservedly so. According to many published histories, the Japanese treated American and other Allied POWs with cruelty bordering on outright barbarism. Incidents, such as the infamous Bataan Death March, are cited as examples of Japanese cruelty. Yet this movie attempts to portray the Japanese in a more balanced and less stereotypical way. True, in this movie too, there are scenes of Japanese beating POWs and forcing the POWs to live in conditions of abject squalor, but to the young boy in the movie, he perceives the Japanese differently. He sincerely respects the Japanese, for their dedication, tenacity, and discipline and in response the Japanese come to respect him too. The movie shows how the young boy went so far as to learn some Japanese, my point being that this movie succeeds in offering a far more sympathetic portrayal of the Japanese than found in other movies of this genre. I'm sure that some POWs who had to endure months and even years of captivity under the Japanese may object to such a portrayal, with valid grounds for feeling that way. Nevertheless, this movie is worth watching.",8,0,2,16 September 2005
American Sniper," The battlefield is not just over there but over here too.
","This is a somber movie about a tragic story. A man, Chris Kyle, dies, tragically, after repeatedly risking his life for his country. While he is alive he is pressured by his wife who is becoming increasingly hysterical to stop going to war, which just drives him away. His job was to methodically kill the enemy, which included women and children who were combatants. That was the nature of the enemy he was fighting. At no time does Kyle derive any joy from doing his job. But he believes in what he is doing and has the full support of his commanders who acknowledge his bravery. Of course, the question is: who exactly are the Americans fighting? And should they even be there? Interestingly, in the movie, Kyle is not the only sniper. The insurgents have a sniper too and he is looking for Kyle. It's too bad that the movie does not tell the audience more about the other sniper, who is fighting his own war. But this movie is not about snipers. It's about fear and terror. Kyle is not the only victim. His wife and children are victims too. While he is fighting the war overseas she is fighting the war at home. Thus, the terror is compounded. The war becomes this monstrous entity that engulfs all who are involved in it. And what makes the story even more tragic is that the battlefield is not just over there but over here too. Bradley Cooper delivers what is probably the strongest performance of his career. That alone makes the movie worth watching.",10,8,27,23 January 2015
Forrest Gump," Powerful performance by Gary Sinise
","This movie is special, and for one reason: Gary Sinise. Mr. Sinise's performance as Lt. Dan is one of the great performances in U. S. cinematic history. His poignant and powerful portrayal of a human being wallowing helplessly in the deepest recesses of despair is uncanny. Lt. Dan is the personification of suffering, of emotional desolation, of a man who is bent on self-destruction but deep down still wants to survive, still harboring a glimmer of hope that things may turn his way, that he may attain salvation and a measure of happiness in a life that has been ravaged by war. Because of Gary Sinise, Forrest Gump is a great movie.",10,1,4,18 July 2006
Gone Baby Gone," Good movie.
","This movie starts off rocky, with a long, rambling monologue which is usually a sign of worse things to come, but incredibly the movie veers away from the brink of cinematic disaster and evolves into a watchable movie with a good ending. Most of the characters are forgettable with the exception of two: the child's mother, played by Amy Ryan, who gives an excellent performance as a hostile, cynical, drug-addicted substance abuser, and Morgan Freeman whose presence is, as usual, commanding. The story picks up in tempo and makes interesting twists and turns as the characters reveal more about themselves and are forced to make decisions that will affect the little girl who is the object of the search. Except for the first 15 minutes which are talky and slow, this is a good movie.",7,2,6,7 December 2007
Southpaw," It is impossible not to like this movie.
","It is impossible not to like this movie. This movie is arguably the best boxing movie in decades. It far surpasses other recent boxing movies in intensity, drama, and content. Jake Gyllenhal's performance is not only phenomenal, it is uncanny. He really looks and acts the part he is playing. He brings a believability and grittiness to the role which makes this movie great. The movie's greatness lies not in the plot, which is predicable, but in the sheer intensity of the acting. In other word, this movie is actor driven, and in this case, the cast does not disappoint. There's no need to rehash the story. Go watch the movie instead. You won't be disappointed.",Null,3,10,25 July 2015
Bridget Jones's Diary," Stay away from this movie. You have been warned.
","This movie is so bad it is shocking. Renee Zellweger prattles on with what has to be one of the phoniest British accents ever in movie history in this vapid, mind numbing story. But what is worse is the character she plays - an annoying, simpering, pouting, insecure, overweight woman whose sole preoccupation is trying to keep relationships with men who obviously do not care about her and should have absolutely nothing to do with her. The character is so unattractive, indeed abrasive, that there should be no surprise that she has problems maintaining relationships. But Ms. Zellweger's horrible, phony British accent is just too much to bear. The producer of this movie couldn't find an English woman to play Bridgit Jones? They had to hire an American actress? Why not have Brad Pitt play Hugh Grant's character? If you like movies which feature American actors playing unattractive, piggish-looking people, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away! You have been warned.Any resemblance between Renee Zellweger's character and any actual British persons, living or deceased, is purely coincidental.",1,3,10,2 August 2009
Captain America: The First Avenger," Simple treatment of complex themes
","A comic book character should be treated as such. To do more is to redefine the character and create something new, rendering the character unrecognizable. This movie succeeds in maintaining the character's identity. However, the problem with the movie is the shallowness of the story, the utter lack of anything that even remotely resembles emotional depth and the simplistic treatment of subjects as complex as the corruption of science and of war itself. Just because a character is out of a comic book does not mean that character should be treated as a caricature. This movie is set during a time of great and momentous change. That does not mean the movie is poorly crafted, rather it means that their is paucity of content as the director opted to dazzle the audience with special effects to keep the audience's attention. Now of course the movie tells a story, but in doing so sends a message suggesting that the U. S. needed superheroes to the war, which is not true. The war as won by regular people who performed heroically, no matter their body type. Nevertheless, the movie is upbeat, the acting is good, the bad guy is sufficiently sinister and for those reasons the movie is worth watching. Just remember: it's fiction; not history.",Null,3,8,5 August 2011
American Hustle," Bradley Cooper is the greatest movie actor in the world today.
","This movie starts out as an unmitigated clunker. For the first half hour or so the story is a meandering nothing, featuring characters who are utterly devoid of interest. This movie is so flat that it gives cause to leave it alone, and chalk it as another waste of time and money. Then, all of a sudden, the movie takes on new life. It immediately becomes interesting, exciting, and above all, fun to watch, and the reason for that: Bradley Cooper. He saves the movie; in fact, he IS the movie. He so thoroughly dominates this movie, meaning, every scene, that the producers could have sent the rest of the cast home. Christian Bale is not funny; Amy Adams is not funny; Jennifer Lawrence is outright shrill; Robert De Niro isn't even credited; but Bradley Cooper IS funny, and engaging, and, most importantly, entertaining. He carries this movie. The story itself is ridiculous, another Hollywood parody on law enforcement, and suggests that federal agents can be co-opted and turned by con artists whose cons are so transparent that a child could see through them. Bradley Cooper rates a 10; the rest of the movie rates a 5. 10+5=15/2=7.5, round off to the next highest number, 8, hence the rating of 8.",8,2,12,27 December 2013
The Godfather: Part II," This movie is a study in greed and depravity.
","This movie is about a struggle for power between two men: the pretentious upstart Michael Corleone, who is trying to establish his legitimacy as Godfather, and Hyman Roth, the most powerful crime figure on the planet, whom Michael both hates and wants to emulate. The movie also shows Michael's depravity and hypocrisy. While committing the most vicious acts in the name of the Family, he is actually systematically targeting for destruction every one closet to him. Michael is nothing but a phony. He reveres his father, Vito, who is his role model, but he can never be another Vito. Vito was respected and loved, while Michael is feared and loathed. Vito attracted people, inspired confidence, was acknowledged a leader, while Michael repels people away. Everyone close to Michael is driven away or killed: Tom, Freddie, Kay, Pentangeli. They are on to Michael and Michael knows it, so he must have them eliminated. The character of Michael Corleone is one of the most chilling characters in cinema history. Michael is cruel and depraved, yet tries to pass himself off as decent and moral. But that is a front which masks his greediness and deceit. Everything he touches he destroys. Michael is so nasty and mean that he even fights Hyman Roth, the one man who has real affection for Michael. But even that is not enough for Michael. For Michael, being a predator, Roth's good will is a sign of weakness to be exploited. The depth of Michael's depravity is bottomless. And in the end, the man for whom family meant everything, has no one. He has either murdered or driven away everyone. He is alone.When this movie was first released oh those so many years ago, I liked it. Recently I watched the movie again. This time, the movie wasn't that good. My main objections to the movie are: the repeated use of flashbacks and the character of Michael. Regarding the flashbacks, they ruined the continuity of the movie. Is this movie about Michael or is it about the first Godfather? Second, the character Michael is so overblown and two-dimensional that not even Al Pacino's excellent performance could totally save it. It seemed that what Michael needed was a therapist to help him work through his misplaced aggression. Michael feels the need to defend his family but defend them against WHAT? Moreover, Michael is married, is the father of two children, is educated and thoroughly middle-class. This profile does not suggest someone who is likely to be directing an organized crime syndicate. Sorry, it just doesn't wash. And when Michael has his older brother murdered, even though his brother is mentally challenged, that defies all logic, even for Michael for whom the family comes first. If this movie is supposed to be a dramatic study of a deeply confused man who harbors paranoid delusions of persecution mixed with a big dose of grandiosity, then this movie is interesting. However, if this movie is trying to suggest that an intelligent, college-educated, married family man, who has the option to go 'legit', would be interested in pursuing a career in organized crime, then this is stretching literary license a bit far. Why not have Michael run for political office instead? Now that could make for an interesting and credible movie.",10,6,13,27 November 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," Why me?
","'Why me? WHY IS IT ALWAYS ME?' This is the plaintive cry that was uttered repeatedly by Capt. Wally Binghamton whenever he was having a run-in with his nemesis Cmdr. Quinton McHale in McHale's Navy. Now I ask the same question, except I'm not contending with a Quinton McHale. Instead I wonder whether it is my fate to watch extremely bad movies, of which this movie may top the list. There is nothing more pathetic cinematically than a pretentious movie. This movie lacks a coherent storyline; lacks anything that even remotely approaches good acting; and is just another noisy Hollywood special effects-a-rama. There is nonstop fighting, ongoing violence, constant noise, but it's not a war movie. Actually I'm still trying to figure out whether this movie is a drama, thriller, action, science-fiction, or what? When I have to struggle figuring out what a movie is about (and Hollywood is not known to produce movies with complex plots) then there is a problem. Maybe it's me ... but maybe it's the movie. I opt for the latter. If you decide to watch this movie and don't like it, don't say I didn't warn you.",3,3,9,16 August 2007
Predator," One Great Movie
","'Predator' may be one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, science fiction movie ever made, and there have been some really great science fiction movies. The idea of an alien being hunting not just defenseless civilians, but heavily armed mercenaries, and hunting them for pure sport, is, to say the least, original. To the alien, these mercenaries are nothing more than playthings to be toyed with and then transformed into trophies. First the mercenaries are baffled, then nervous, and then outright terrified as they come to the realization that their weapons are useless and their bravado a waste of energy against an entity far more merciless and powerful then they could ever imagine. And when the alien finally reveals itself, it's appearance is as gruesome as it's behavior is lethal. Why the alien is there is never answered, nor does it have to be answered because it's entirely irrelevant to story. The fact is the alien has arrived and is wreaking havoc on a group of heavily armed men whose efforts to respond are repeatedly thwarted. It's not as if they are defenseless; to the contrary, they WANT to fight, but this time they are up against something that they can't figure out and that is not afraid of them. How they deal with this situation and it's ultimate resolution is what this movie is about. It's nonstop action from beginning to end, and you can't expect any more than that from a movie.",10,2,4,26 July 2005
Nightcrawler," You wanna make a buck? Go buy a camcorder.
","Some movies are good, some are not good. This movie rates in the latter category. Lou Bloom is no Travis Bickle and Nina is no Betsy and Los Angeles is no New York City circa 1976, and this story in no way even remotely approaches Taxi Driver in terms of sheer terror or its sinister portrayal of a dysfunctional society. In short, the story is flat and stale. This is because the theme of seedy people in the seedy underside of society has been done so often that it's now a cliché. One need only to watch Chinatown or Crash to get a glimpse of the underbelly of Los Angeles. Indeed, even Pretty Woman (1990) deals with that subject. The 1949 movie The Third Man is set in a city that's not only seedy, but divided into sectors as well. The relationship between Lou and Nina is stretching the limits of plausibility. Lou is not that maladjusted and Nina is not that desperate. Lou hits on a way to make a living and he's good at what he does. There's nothing wrong with that. He likes being self-employed and being his own boss. It satisfies him emotionally. Good for him.",6,1,5,15 November 2014
The Aviator," Solid Movie about Howard Hughes.
","Okay, I'm still recovering from 'The Titanic' debacle, so I didn't buy into Leonardo Di Caprio playing Howard Hughes, and although Kate Blanchett's portrayal of Kathryn Hepburn was shrill and annoying, and the pseudo-psychology used to explain Mr. Hughes's idiosyncrasies were flat-out crude and ludicrous, and the scene where Mr. Hughes is staggering around in his hotel room naked utterly devoid of any entertainment value, still this is a solid movie. It's a solid movie because of the life of Howard Hughes itself. The story of Howard Hughes is not his mental illness, nor his affair with Kathryn Hepburn, nor his run-in with Congress. Rather the story of Howard Hughes is about what Hughes did, what he built, what he accomplished, what an incredibly great and gifted man he was. He was rich man, but he was also a worker, a test pilot, a builder, an innovator, an inventor, as well as a pioneer Hollywood producer and director. No matter how hard this movie tries to portray Mr. Hughes as some kind of oddball, and no matter how unbelievable and superficial is Mr. Di Caprio's portrayal of Howard Hughes, the man's accomplishments could not be ignored or denigrated, even in this movie, and they speak for themselves. So Howard Hughes had mental problems? So what? What is important is what Howard Hughes did, and for that reason this movie should be watched.",8,1,2,2 August 2005
Burn After Reading," A good movie but not a great one.
","A good movie. A clever movie. A great movie? No way. Not even close. The movie has a muddled story and is not particularly humorous. BUT there is one aspect of this movie that saves it from DVD oblivion - the stellar performance of John Malkovich. Mr. Malkovich makes this movie work. He is actually FUNNY. This cannot be said for the other performers. Was Frances McDormand funny? NO. Brad Pitt? NO. By the way, he was not the Brad Pitt of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Troy, two movies in which he excelled. Brad Pitt playing a buffoon is an example of flagrant miscasting. Nevertheless the actors give strong performances and the story does offer an interesting take on the nature of bureaucracy and human irrationality. There are movies in which casting top stars as goofy, cartoon-like characters work, but this is not one of those movies. Casting Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Dan Ackroyd, Bill Murray, Jack Black, Eddie Murphy, Ben Stiller, or Steve Carell as buffoons can generate laughs with the right material but comedic acting can fall flat with the wrong cast and in this movie, with the exception of Mr. Malkovich, it falls flat.",7,3,8,14 September 2008
Watchmen," Excellent musical soundtrack in an otherwise mediocre movie.
","For a movie to be effective as entertainment, it has to tell a coherent story. This movie does not do that. Instead the story is a convoluted series of disconnected scenes. Also, the use of an alternative future does not work. It is too contrived. The superheroes are back, but so what? The acting was good, especially that of Stephen McHattie who is the star of the movie. The actor who plays the Comedian also gives an excellent performance. But the entire production seems to be little more than an animated comic book, which is not surprising since the movie is based on comic book characters. However, this movie offers one excellent feature: the music. The musical soundtrack includes 'Sounds of Silence' by Simon and Garfunkle. Because of the musical soundtrack the movie, if not great, is at least watchable.",6,0,3,11 March 2009

","Alright, friends, a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie, the bad as well as the good, and this movie put me to the test. I won't mince words. This movie was bad. The story was bad. The acting was bad. The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better. Indeed I asked myself why did I even bother to see this rotten trashy movie? Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspected would be bad? The answer is, of course, that I am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided. I will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie, except to say that the quality of the acting was, to put it politely, subpaar.

Man of Steel," A mature and powerful interpretation of the Superman story.
","This movie is excellent. Reason: it tells a story. Also, it is not a rip off of the previous movies of the Superman genre. Instead, it offers a unique interpretation of the Superman story. It frames the story as a morality tale with the protagonist caught in a moral conflict, one which defies an easy solution. Also, the story's main antagonist, General Zod, has a plausible reason for doing what he does. That is, his actions are not motivated by any sadistic urges but rather are part of a mission, one that Superman cannot readily dismiss since it involves him too. One can almost sympathize with Zod's plight. Also, the story plays up the fact that Superman is an alien, and one who could also pose a threat to the human race ... if he wants. Unlike previous Superman movies, this movie deals with Superman in a forthright manner and not merely as a comic book character with special powers. That Superman must disguise himself as a human is evidence of his own uncertain and tenuous relationship with the rest of the world. This uncertainty permeates throughout the movie as Superman is shown concealing his true identity in order to avoid alarming people. This ambivalence raises the story of Superman to a more mature and dramatically powerful level. Henry Cavill is excellent as Superman and the rest of the cast is equally excellent too. This movie is a must-see for all movie buffs and for everyone else too.",10,2,8,18 June 2013
Grease," Entertaining movie
","Okay, the acting is not the greatest, the story line is somewhat shallow, adults playing teenagers - that's stretching credibility a bit far. But who cares? This movie WORKS as a musical, as a tribute to a bygone era, when characters like those in the movie actually existed, when do-wop was king, when the Dodgers were in Brooklyn, the Giants in New York and the Athletics in Philadelphia, when the Cleveland Browns were the best team in football. Here it's the music and singing and dancing that matters, nothing else. If you want serious drama, this movie is not for you, but if you want a musical, you've come to the right place. A movie should entertain, and this movie entertains. The movie is upbeat, optimistic, funny, fast-paced, and with lots of singing and dancing. I liked it. Maybe you'll like it too.",8,2,4,26 July 2005
28 Weeks Later," One of the best sci-fi movies in a long long time.
","I went to watch this movie with no preconceived notions regarding the quality of the movie. In fact, I never heard of the movie, but what I watched was impressive. It's not a horror movie. Rather it's a science fiction movie that's based on a highly plausible premise. The action is fast-paced, accompanied by a musical score that intensifies the growing sense of doom as attempts to contain and eradicate a lethal disease unravel with catastrophic results. The scope of this movie is reminiscent of The Body Snatchers and The Day of the Triffids, the latter an excellent, and now all-but-forgotten, sci-fi story. This is one of the best science-fiction movies in a long long time and proof that when it wants Hollywood can present a credible sci-fi movie that tells a story and does not insult the audience's intelligence.",10,10,18,18 May 2007

What I believed would be a typical Hollywood juvenile piece of celluloid tripe was actually a watchable, engaging motion picture with a good story, good acting, a credible script and ... a beginning, a middle and an end. The movie glorifies the art of card-counting and paints a rather cynical picture of the human condition but never sinks to the level of a maudlin melodrama. The movie also is unpretentious and tells a story without trying to moralize. One thing is for certain: if you are a member of the Las Vegas chamber of commerce you will definitely love this movie because this movie has to rank as one of the better movies whose setting is Las Vegas.",8,0,0,3 May 2008
The Revenant," Fancy cinematography concealing a conventional story.
","What kind of movie is this? Under all the grim yet starkly beautiful exterior scenery, there is a conventional story. Although the story is set in the western US of the 1830s, which at the time was wilderness, the movie plays more like an action comic. The main character is indestructible and his nemesis, named Fitzgerald, played by Tom Hardy, comparably sinister (although far less intelligent). Nothing kills the main character, whose name is Glass, played by Leonardo De Caprio. He's shot, mauled, stabbed, starved, frozen, beaten, buried alive, caroms over waterfalls, and lives. And if that isn't enough, he is also cajoled, belittled, humiliated, and mocked without lapsing into despair. This is stretching literary license to the limit. It also takes away whatever suspense there may be as to how the story will end. If an enraged grizzly bear and aggressive Native Americans can't kill him, you know that the bad guy doesn't have a chance. It's just a matter of time. So, the ending of the movie is a foregone conclusion. De Caprio is good as Glass, the man with a mission. He is a metaphor for suffering and self-righteous anger. (Why he is angry will not be revealed here. For that, watch the movie.) This movie shows to what lengths a person will go to survive, at least according to Hollywood. The problem is: we know Glass is going to survive. Regarding Tom Hardy's performance as Fitzgerald, it's part John Wayne doing Rooster Cogburn, part Jeff Bridges doing Roy Pulsipher from R.I.P.D., with a dose of Foghorn Leghorn filling in the rest, except nastier and dumber (even dumber than Mr. Leghorn). There's no way that a dullard like Fitzgerald is going to fool anyone as to his nefarious purposes. He would have done better if he had just worn a sign saying 'I am a bad guy.' Now, the movie does offer some useful tips on how to survive in the wild. 1. According to the movie, if you happen to be stuck in the middle of nowhere with a dead horse, that horse could still save your life. To find out how, watch the movie. (hint: you must be familiar with a horse's internal anatomy) 2. Never shoot an enraged grizzly bear, stab it instead. (Apparently, for some reason, the movie maker believes that a bullet is less effective than a knife as a weapon.) 3. Never deny a Native American's request for a horse. It could lead to serious problems. (But problems can be avoided if you are willing to trade for a woman.) These are just a few of the many things this movie teaches on how to survive in the wild. Thus, the movie provides a useful public service.",6,6,12,14 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Dull and boring.
","This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy, and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned. Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out, there's no story.",3,43,79,22 October 2015
Knowing," A slow sci-fi flick.
","For a movie that deals with the apocalypse, it was really quite a bore. Numbers ... disasters ... fate ... destiny, these are themes of this seemingly long and dragged out movie. This has to be one of the longest two-hour movies made by Hollywood. The action drags, the acting is humdrum and the story is devoid of any suspense. Even the scene with the airplane crash quickly loses its initial dramatic impact. Nicholas Cage gives a solid but uninspiring performance as a college professor with a secret that cannot possibly grab anyone's interest. The best part of the movie is right before the final scene when the earth ... well, if you really want to know what happens go watch the movie, but if you leave the movie feeling a little let down or just plain tired, don't blame me because I told you so.",6,1,3,8 April 2009
Doctor Zhivago," A true artist will not be bought off.
","It's amazing how one's perceptions of something can change, such as one's opinion of a movie like Doctor Zhivago. Heretofore this movie had seemed to be overly long, stagy, pretentious and boring. But after watching the movie again, this is another take on the story. The movie is about creativity in times of turmoil, about artistic integrity and about a man's desire not only to survive but to do so on his own terms. The main character, Doctor Zhivago, could have easily sold out to the Bolsheviks but at the price of his artistic integrity, which he would not surrender at any price. Far from being stagy, the acting is powerful, the scenes intense, the conflicts well defined. Throughout the movie the Doctor has choices to make and his choices are always on the side of what is good for those for whom he cares. Zhivago's half-brother, Yuri, serves as a metaphor for what the Doctor would have become if he had towed the line, just another bureaucrat. This movie offers an inspirational story about a man who stays true to his beliefs while under immense pressure to conform. Wonderful movie.If someone is suffering from insomnia or some other kind of sleep deprivation disorder, permit me to recommend a dose of Doctor Zhivago. Now this statement may come as a surprise to any history aficionado who has ever studied the Russian Revolution in which the story of this movie takes place. Few, if any, events in human history were more exciting and dynamic than the Russian Revolution. But after this movie gets through with the Russian Revolution, you may never want to study history again. In this movie the Russian Revolution is relegated to being a mere back-drop for some kind of convoluted love-triangle, or love-square, or love-something, all revolving around the character of Yuri Zhivago who has to be the weakest central character ever contrived in the history of Hollywood. Now, a dramatic movie is not a documentary and one should not expect more than the usual Hollywood treatment of great events in history. But this movie is so banal and the characters, with the exception of Komorofsky, so weak, unlikable, pretentious and forgettable, that one may lose all interest in history and make believe that the Russian Revolution never happened. But at least you'll get a good night's sleep.",9,3,10,30 July 2005
Judgment at Nuremberg," Incredibly powerful movie.
","When you talk about an actor stealing the show, in this movie Maximiliam Schell is that actor. Wow, he IS the movie. This is a case where the actor takes good material and creates something brilliant. The concept of a war crimes trials congers up scenes of outraged, indignant prosecutors who, with exaggerated self-righteousness, are loudly and vociferously denouncing the defendants who sit passively and take it. This movie, however, presents a different slant. Here it is the defense that is outraged, and with good reason. Did the defendants actually break any laws? After all, were they not respected judges? Is somebody to be found guilty for being a mere hack? And what right did the court have to try these judges anyway? Okay, the judges may have been Nazis, but was being a Nazi a crime? Indeed, was the trial itself a sham? Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland give powerful performances as victims of Nazi persecution, yet was their testimony sufficient to establish guilt, and of what? This is one of the most powerful movies Hollywood as ever produced. It explores themes that warrant close attention and pulls no punches in presenting issues that deal with such fundamental concepts as right-and-wrong, responsibility, culpability and expediency.",10,0,0,27 November 2010
Salt," Three cheers for Angelina Jolie.
","What a great movie! Fast-paced, high energy entertainment. Angelina Jolie has never been better. She is truly the star of this movie. Kudos to the director and the rest of the production crew for how they managed to take a complex story and create a coherent motion picture that offers dazzling special effects, high drama, intense conflicts and a surprise ending. Far from being obvious, the movie succeeds in grabbing and keeping the audience's interest as the plot unfolds and develops. Liev Schreiber gives a chilling portrayal of a high ranking government official with a hidden agenda and the rest of the cast is equally excellent in their support roles. But the star as always is the beautiful and talented Ms. Jolie. She carries this movie and through her efforts this movie becomes great entertainment. Although the story may seem far-fetched, it really isn't. The movie poses serious questions relating to the loyalty of government officials and our national security. Three cheers for Angelina Jolie as she stars in yet another wonderful movie.",10,17,32,3 August 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," Great spoof. However, if you are a bathroom sink, you will not like this movie.
","What a surprisingly funny and entertaining movie. This movie is one of the best spoofs on media stars to come out in a long time. Not only was John C. Reilly wonderful in his role as Dewey Cox, the entire cast was great. Special commendation must be afforded to Raymond J. Barry who plays Dewey's rambunctious father. Mr. Barry was truly hilarious. Now there a lot of nudity in this movie, but it's part of the story and without it the story of Dewey Cox could not be effectively told. If you like a clever script, strong comedic acting, and a movie that is a great parody of the entertainment industry and undoubtedly draws its material from the actual depraved behavior of some of the most well-known and internationally famous entertainment stars, then this movie is for you. Remember, though, the humor is adult and it's not for kids.There are so many things wrong with Dewey the character. At times he can be downright nasty; most of the time he is thoughtless and self-centered. Nevertheless, the creators of this movie have succeeded in developing a character who, despite his myriad of shortcomings, is likable, and, unlike the mentally challenged and emotionally stilted Forrest Gump, is a creditable metaphor for the human condition - and for a Hollywood movie, that's impressive.This movie also devotes a lot of time to some rather unconventional utilization of bathroom plumbing.",10,5,9,2 January 2008
Silver Linings Playbook," Pat and Tiffany are the love couple of the 2010s.
","This movie is not a comedy. It's about how mental illness impacts an entire family, and community. Bradley Cooper's performance is brilliant. He carries this movie. The movie is character driven; it's about a mentally ill person who is trying to come to terms with people he believes he hurt while at the same time trying to accept the fact that he is mentally ill. The movie deals with issues of noncompliance with medications, resistance to treatment, parent-child issues, marital discord, domestic violence, and personal redemption. Jennifer Lawrence is endearing as a vulnerable young woman who masks her vulnerability with bravado. Robert DeNiro is great as Bradley Cooper's father. His character has issues too, which is why this movie is so wonderful: everybody in the movie has issues, and isn't that what life is about - dealing with issues? The movie generates few laughs because it's story is too serious, too down to earth and too realistic. After all, what is so funny about somebody being released from a mental hospital? One other point: Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in the dance scene are wonderful. Two endearing characters that the audience can root for, this makes for a wonderful movie. And if the plot is contrived, so what? It's a movie, and it's about people dealing with issues. Mental illness is debilitating and the recovery process can be rocky. The movie dramatizes that without becoming corny. Bradley Cooper deserves all the recognition he may receive for a strong acting performance of a complex character. After watching this movie one can leave the theater feeling not only entertained but sensitized to the needs of the mentally ill. After all, Pat can be anyone of us, and what happens to him can become anyone's story. Pat and Tiffany are the love couple of the 2010s; they have replaced George and Martha and Oliver and Barbara as icons for the dysfunctional couple and for this reason: Pat and Tiffany ring true; their relationship is strained yet passionate without being theatrical. The mother signing out her son; the father struggling to connect with his son; a young woman who feels cheated by life; and a man who is coming to terms with his own vulnerability all make for an excellent movie.",10,3,6,23 January 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," It's Okay but it's not 'Sideways'
","Okay, the premise of this movie is somewhat shaky, but the movie is amusing, and at times provokes outright laughter. Yet this movie also has its serious side, which actually detracts from the movie's entertainment value because the main character is neither a social misfit or a buffoon. Instead, he is person who chooses to remain celibate and demands that his decision be respected, which is anything but amusing. For it's not that he can't 'get laid,' or doesn't want to, it's just that he wants 'action' on his own terms or not at all, which doesn't make for a funny character. If the main character were goofy, like, for instance, Austin Powers, or were some kind of pompous martinet, like, for instance, Captain Wally Binghamton in 'McHale's Navy,' then this movie may have been much funnier. But here the 40-year-old virgin is actually quite normal, friendly, and likable. In short, he is boring. It would be like trying to laugh at Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy while taking them seriously. This is an okay movie, but if you want to watch a really funny movie, watch 'Sideways.'",6,0,3,8 September 2005
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Shallow story, yet entertaining.
","The story is shallow, the characters as two dimensional as a piece of paper, the use of special effects way overdone, yet the movie is good. This is the case because of the presence of Tom Cruise. Working with a script that devoid of even the pretense of intellectuality, he manages to keep this movie watchable. Cruise's performance is uncanny. Although no longer a young man, his personal in the movie is entirely youthful. His delivery of one-liners matches is superb, proving that he is one of the best comic actors in cinema today. And that fits perfectly with this movie because what the movie is slapstick comedy mixed in with some action-adventure stuff to produce a cacophony of action in which the plot becomes irrelevant. The movie is pure action. As a venue for special effects and incredible stunts, this movie delivers, with interest. As for the story itself, that's an entirely different matter.",7,0,3,8 September 2015
Spider-Man," Mediocre
","If you like comic book characters who perform acts of superhuman strength, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, the movie offers little else which warrants commendation. The story is simplistic and superficial, the characters two-dimensional; the acting, with the exception of Willem Dafoe's, is mediocre; and the special effects contrived. Any story involving a human being becoming transformed into a spider-like creature should evoke a sense of terror and horror over such a change, especially when the human knows what is happening. Yet this movie offers none of that. (Compare Spiderman to the Jeff Goldblum character in 'The Fly' and you know what I'm referring to.) Instead, the movie remains essentially a comic-book story about a comic-book character. That being the case, why not just read the comic book?",4,0,2,17 December 2005
Jarhead," The movie makes a point but not a good time for mocking the military.
","Below are two critiques of the movie 'Jarhead.' Now, before you take the time to read these critiques, please note this: the main problem with this movie is not that it mocks the Marines, but rather the timing of this movie, being released at a time when over 2,000 Americans have been killed and thousands more injured in a war that has been going on for over two years, thus seriously undermining the movie's credibility and calling into the question the judgment of the producers who for reasons probably known only to them decided to release a movie mocking an organization whose members are being killed almost on a daily basis.'Be All That You Can Be.' That's what the commercial says about joining the military. Along with the message are images of soldiers looking sharp and handsome, clean cut, ready to serve their country proudly and with honor. And then there's the military according to the movie 'Jarhead.' In this movie, once you join the military, in this case the Marines, you have immediate license to become, and indeed are expected to become, a complete, unmitigated, unmistakable, certifiable degenerate. If this movie doesn't convey any other message, it conveys that one, loud and clear or should I say 'front and center'? According to 'Jarhead' which means empty-headed, like no brain or no intellect, only the misfits of society become soldiers. Anyone with a brain, or with any sense at all, is doing something else, like, for instance, f----- your girl. And when you come home from the war, which in this movie lasts four days, after six torturous months of waiting in the middle of nowhere, the only person who personally greets you is a Vietnam Veteran of questionable mental stability. According to 'Jarhead' not only are the enlisted soldiers of questionable moral and intellectual fiber, the officers are even worse - they won't even let the soldiers fight. Indeed, according to 'Jarhead' being a soldier means using profanity, denigrating women, being irritable, being prone to impulsiveness, mocking your fellow soldier, and being a basic screw up. And the last is shown by what happens to the soldiers when the go home after their four-day war - they are all outside the mainstream of society, unable to adjust, incapable of adjusting - complete screw ups. According to 'Jarhead' joining the military means a life of unbearable tedium and boredom interspersed with episodes of in-group violence and drunkenness, egged on by non-commissioned officers who have nothing better to do then torture their own troops with meaningless details like piling up sand bags and then taking them down - in the rain. Duh! According to 'Jarhead' names like Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa mean absolutely nothing. The exploits of the Marines in years past are simply forgotten. According to 'Jarhead' if you'd mention D-Day, the modern-day Marine may say: 'D-Day? Duh! What's that? Don't bother me with history, just give me my beer! I wonder if Jodie is f----- my girl? Ugh! Who cares anyway? I'm not worth waiting for.' Where's John Wayne when we need him? Where's Robert Taylor? Where's Lloyd Nolan and William Bendix? Where's Dana Andrews and all the other movie heroes that glorified the military and made the audience swell with pride at the mere sight of the American flag? If you asked a 'Jarhead' Marine, he'd probably say: 'DUH! Gimme a beer you f-----g idiot and stop wasting my time. Who the heck are those guys anyway? And WHO CARES?' Although mocking the military is nothing new, doing so during a time of war is, to put it mildly, poor timing and in bad taste. Maybe the war in 1991 was four days old; the current war has been going on for two and a half years with no sign of abetting, and during that time the U. S. has lost over 2,000 killed and many thousand's more injured. Let Hollywood make a movie about THAT!!!'Jarhead' is the perhaps the most unflattering portrayal of military life in the long annals of Hollywood movies. According to this movie, once a person puts on the uniform he immediately regresses to the level of a five year old child - impulsive, tempestuous, violent, irritable, acting-out, yet dependent on higher authority for direction and survival. Moreover, this regressive and pathological behavior is not only condoned by the military, it is positively encouraged. Further, this movie also suggests that once you are in the military you are no longer a part of mainstream society and are treated accordingly by others outside of the military. In addition, this movie also suggests that the military gives license to behavior that is so maladaptive that it's almost laughable. Further, this movie suggests that large armies are now obsolete as wars are now fought not for territory but to achieve certain political or economic objectives that have little to do with actually having to conquer and occupy land. Far from being one of the foundations of our society, the military, as portrayed in this movie, is little more than a depository for all the social misfits who cannot fit into normal society. In fact, in 'Jarhead' there isn't even much of a war. But that's in 1991; in 2005 the situation is far different. By the way: What's wrong with hurrying up and waiting? Better to wait, be bored, do your gripping and go home disgruntled but alive and well than fight and die for nothing. If someone is thirsting for glory, let them rent 'Sands of Iwo Jima.'Even though the movie conveys an unfair and negative message about the military and seems to have a certain political slant, this is still a powerfully compelling movie about the brutalization of soldiers who are expected to fight and die - even if there's no enemy. Accordingly, I give this movie an 8.",8,2,5,15 November 2005
Bad Teacher," A wonderful Cameron Diaz movie.
","Cameron Diaz is great in this movie. She is beautiful and talented and funny and proves it in this movie. She is a marvelous actress. Justin Timberlake is impressive too, but this movie is clearly a Cameron Diaz vehicle, and for good reason: she is funny! Ms. Diaz should star in a upbeat TV sitcom. Her screen presence is so strong that she dominates every scene in the movie. Mr. Timberlake is one of the great straight men. His mere presence in a scene generates laughs. Jason Segel has funny moments too. The story is zany, goofy and upbeat. It's a farce, a romp, and a laugh-producing machine. If you like Cameron Diaz, you won't be disappointed and if you don't like her, watch the movie. She is wonderful.",Null,5,12,13 July 2011
Dallas Buyers Club," Outstanding movie about important themes.
","This movie is wonderful. It contains all the elements of a great movie. It has a strong script, excellent acting, compelling themes and terrific cinematography. This movie contains what is probably Matthew McConaughey's best performance. He carries the movie. He is in just about every scene. The movie deals with several themes - AIDS, terminal illness, government regulations, response to crisis, change of life issues, homosexuality, promiscuity, personal responsibility, and capitalism. All these themes are treated forthrightly.After watching this movie, one should come away with a better understanding and appreciation of the issues raised. But although the movie touches on themes that have political implications, it is first and foremost a drama. Although the movie takes some literary license, such as frank depictions of sickness and drug abuse, none of it is gratuitous. That is, it adds to the story.",10,108,141,26 November 2013
The Fast and the Furious," It's more than just an action movie.
","This is a great movie. Far from being superficial pulp, this movie has a complex plot. Vin Diesel's performance is tremendous; his screen presence is dominating. He succeeds in carrying the movie. Although the movie contains lots of glitz, it also tells a story that deals with themes such as loyalty and betrayal. The rest of the cast is excellent too, especially Jordana Brewster and Paul Walker. Michelle Rodriguez is as usual wonderful. It would be easy to dismiss this movie as being little more than a live action cartoon, but the movie really is full of surprises. It has several intensely dramatic scenes, some of the most incredible car chase scenes, and some deeply esoteric verbal exchanges fraught with emotion. Whether it's Vin Diesel pouting or Paul Walker being heroic, the results are same: nonstop action, intense dialog, and interesting characters, all of which together produce great entertainment. It's more than just about automobiles.",9,28,40,24 October 2011
The Exorcist," Good vs. Evil
","This movie is the quintessential story of Good vs. Evil. The story is powerful, compelling and credible. Further, it's not a horror movie. Rather, it's a movie about faith, sacrifice, and self-exploration. For this movie portrays a struggle which brings out self-doubt and renders the characters utterly helpless in the face of a force so overwhelming and malevolent that the protagonists are literally thrown against the wall. A little girl is possessed ... or is she? The situation tests the characters' faith and belief in powers beyond the ability of science to detect, accept or control. Even the young priest himself has doubts and undergoes a test of faith that transforms him from a self-doubting and guilt-ridden hypocrite into one of the great heroes in the history of cinema. As such, it is a true work of art and definitely worth watching.",1,4,19,8 August 2005
Now You See Me," Interesting take on the con-job theme.
","This is an offbeat movie that approaches the level of excellence but does not quite make it. The story is cleverly developed and the acting excellent but in total the project, although entertaining, just misses the mark. The biggest problem with the movie is the ending, which will not be revealed here. Suffice it to say, however, that it could have been treated better. Also, James Franco, although a wonderful actor, seemed to be not the right actor for the part of the FBI agent, which is the principal character in the story. Not that he does not do a good job with the role, but it seems that the story required a different kind of character than the one played by Franco. As for the rest of the cast, they are excellent. Morgan Freeman again delivers a strong performance and Michael Caine is superb. These wonderful actors, both up in years, defy time. One thing this movie shows is that inside information plus some cleverly staged tricks can produce some interesting results, especially when money is involved.",8,1,4,25 June 2013
Captain America: Civil War," People want heroes, not laughing stocks. This movie delivers the latter.
","A bunch of cartoon characters making a lot a noise and fuss for reasons that remain a mystery. There's a lot of fighting and mayhem, along with the usual dose of high-tech special effects. The problem is that the story is so shallow as to render it almost nonexistent. Good guys fighting good guys for reasons that are so contrived that even for comic-book characters it simply is not enough to justify all the mayhem. Would be like the Lone Ranger fighting Tonto over politics. Who cares? The formula just does not work. Plus, the movie has a lot of silly dialog, which provoked unintended laughter. There is little attempt at character development. Soon it becomes apparent that there are no good guys or bad guys, just a bunch of guys flexing their high-tech muscles. The use of flashbacks just adds to the confusion. The Spiderman character is incredibly mushy, even for a comic book story. The only character that has some depth is Iron Man, played by Robert Downey Jr. It seems that much of the plot centers around him. But he does not carry the story. The movie failed to engage the audience's attention. Even a story based on comic book characters has to have some dramatic content. Otherwise, as in the case of this movie, the entire story becomes stagy, shallow and noisy. Noise is no substitute for drama. The audience wants characters they can care about, not laugh at. Listen Hollywood: people want heroes, not laughing stocks. Have Captain America fighting Nazis, not his friends. Have Tony Stark save people in distress. Have the beautiful Black Widow show the world that she is great. Have these super heroes do superb things that win them real acclaim. If it wants to, Hollywood can write those kinds of stories.",4,15,31,18 May 2016
Pearl Harbor," 'December 7, 1941 - A date which will live in infamy' (FDR, 1941)
","First let me say that I liked this movie. I repeat: I ... LIKED ... THIS ... MOVIE. I know that the story has more holes in it than Swiss cheese and the special effects were somewhat overblown (get the pun?), but this movie is not about the characters nor is it about the special effects. Rather it's about an event that galvanized a nation and transformed the world. That is, it's about the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. After Pearl Harbor, the world was never the same, and although the movie has it's weaknesses, one thing is for certain: after watching this movie, you know that SOMETHING BIG happened on that fateful day and that it effected a lot of people in different ways. Maybe the movie should have provided more historical background - but it's not a documentary. Or maybe the movie should have had a better script - but did that really matter? What DOES matter is the event itself, and in this respect, despite the over-reliance on special effects, the movie does its job well. For this reason I cannot be too critical and that alone is enough to make this movie worth watching.Kate Beckinsdale gives an excellent performance. She is a great actress.",8,2,6,27 July 2005
Tropic Thunder," This movie is great! This movie is a classic!~ This movie must be watched!
","This movie is brilliant. It's more than a comedy; it's about actors who are forced to face the truth about themselves and in the process experience personal growth and achieve personal happiness. Also, Brandon Soo-Hoo's performance is outstanding. He should have won all kinds of awards. However, the strongest performance was Jack Black's. He shows what a truly great actor he is. The four principal characters are a composite of humanity. They use acting to cover up their insecurities and avoid dealing with their issues. One actor believes that nobody cares about him; another, that he is personally inadequate; another, that he is worthless; and the fourth, that he is a hypocrite. How these characters deal with their issues is what this movie is about.This movie is one of the greatest comedy movies ever made in the history of Hollywood and all of movies. This movie rocks! This movie has it all. The laughter is nonstop! Ben Stiller is at his very best. He is hilarious. Jack Black as Jeff Portney is incredible. He proves once again that he is among the top comedy actors. His skit, Fatties II, is a classic. How can one not laugh at that? But the highest and most extravagant accolades must be reserved for Rbbert Downey Jr. He lifts comedy to new heights of laughter. His take off on method acting is uncanny. His performance is amazing. Of course, let's not forget Tom Cruise and Mathew McConaughy. If these guys aren't meant for comedy, then what are they meant for? Tom Cruise's take off a the pushy, arrogant Hollywood producer is a classic. No one could have done that role better than him. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!!!!!This movie has an interesting premise. What happens when the movie becomes real ... and the actors don't know it? It could work as a comedy, and here the results are mixed, but that is not surprising because it is primarily an action movie interspersed with some comedy scenes. Ben Stiller is quite amusing in as Simple Jack, which is a parody of Rain Man, but it is Robert Downey Jr. who steals the show with his incredible performance as a white guy playing a black guy who gets so caught up in the role that he is on the verge of a having a mental breakdown. This movie is further proof that Robert Downey Jr. is one of Hollywood's great actors. Give him a role, he will make it happen. What's next for Mr. Downey? Perhaps a musical? If so, you know he will be great. Jack Black was also wonderful and the rest of the supporting cast, particularly young Brandon Soo Hoo, give excellent performances. If you're looking for a comedy with lots of laughs, this may not be the movie for you. But if you want to watch an action movie with some excellent and at times amusing performances then this movie is for you.Additional comments: I am revising my rating upward from 6 to 8. This is a good movie, with interesting performances, and with moments of humor that add to the movie without detracting from the action. The three lead actors are excellent and the story is unique.This is not the first movie from the movie-turns-into-real-life genre. Three Amigos, The Purple Rose of Cairo and the French Lieutenants's Woman also have similar premises.",10,2,6,15 August 2008
The Duchess," Beautiful, charming movie. Bravo to Keira Knightley.
","Move over Scarlet O' Hara. Here comes Georgina Cavendish, bringing with her enough emotional baggage to overload a convoy of ships, in an intriguing and engaging period piece movie. Keira Knightley is superb as the heroine Georgina and Ralph Fiennes gives a commanding performance as Georgina's emotionally frigid husband, Lord Devonshire, who must have a son. This movie grabs and keeps the audience's attention and provides a glimpse of what life must have been like for the English aristocracy in the late 18th century. But the central character of this movie is always Georgina as she negotiates the rough waters of a loveless marriage and the infidelity that follows. Georgina is wonderful, she is heroic, she is persevering, she is of nobility yet is a champion of the people and a character who the audience can like and even love. Keira Knightley's performance does full justice to the life and times of Georgina Cavendish, and the story reminds us that despite their wealth and titles, the English nobility were people too.",10,1,5,11 October 2008
Quantum of Solace," It's time for James Bond to retire.
","This movie gives reasonable cause to ask: Is James Bond passé? Is the genre of James Bond movies now a thing for the history books? Daniel Craig's performance is uninspiring and the story itself is so devoid of anything that even remotely challenges ones intellect that the entire movie becomes a bore, and James Bond movies are not supposed to be boring. Every aspect of this story is predictable, every character a reiteration of previous characters, every special effect utterly superfluous in a transparent attempt to fill in those spaces where the dialog fails or is entirely absent. The problem however is not so much the quality of the movie making, it's rather the genre itself. James Bond has been eclipsed by other action characters who are more dynamic, more powerful and more interesting than Bond, who's been on the scene since 1962. How many more times can Mr. Bond be introduced to the audience? Enough already. Let's remember James Bond as he was - debonair, suave, bold, dashing and above all original and unconventional - and all the beautiful women, wonderful villains and startling scenery that characterized those early productions. Mr. Bond is tired, he should retire and maybe become a consultant. But please, no more movies! His day has passed.",5,2,4,20 November 2008
The Dirty Dozen," Dumb movie that is an insult to the memory of all of our heroic soldiers.
","Whwn I first saw this movie many years ago, I thought this movie was great. A bunch of misfit soldier, all with major personality disorders which render them incapable of obeying orders, are magically transformed into an elite unit of fighters who perform acts of heroism that border on the miraculous. But, alas, things change and with it my opinion about this movie. IS THIS MOVIE FOR REAL? Are we supposed to believe that our military heroes are little more than psychopaths? Are our Medal of Honor winners anything like the perverts portrayed in this movie? Are we supposed to believe that such characters were even allowed to stay in the army? Are we supposed to be believe that such characters were entrusted with defense of the United States? Are we supposed to believe that such characters could last even one minute on the same battlefield with the Germans? No way! Our heroes were men of honor, men who put duty before everything else, men who were brave and who were good, men who were nothing like the misanthropes portrayed in this movie. This movie is just another example of Hollywood using an historical incident, such as in this case World War Two, to make a movie that shows scene after scene of gratuitous violence, this time involving mentally ill soldiers. Compare this movie with 'All Quiet on the Western Front' or 'Paths of Glory,' and then you may understand what I'm talking about.",4,11,27,26 September 2005
Gone with the Wind," One of the great movies.
","This is a great movie, the reason for that being the incredible performance by Vivian Leigh who succeeds in carrying this movie. Without Leigh's strong and dominating performance, the story would have come off as hokey and melodramatic. Essentially, the story revolves around one person: Scarlett O'Hara, a flighty, impetuous, high-spirited and manipulative young woman who is pursuing a fantasy, to marry a man who does not love her and never will, and who by his own admission is a failure. People come and go, situations change, war starts and ends, but she never changes. Yet she also has endearing qualities - she is brave, resourceful, loyal, and a leader. She also commands respect. She is not adverse to working hard and stays focused on completing tasks. She understands business and is cognizant of the major political issues of the day. Of all the characters in the movie, she is the most complex, even more so than Rhett Butler. The story is engaging because of those many qualities which put her at odds with the rest of the world, which in the movie tests her ability and willingness to survive. Hence, Scarlett is hardly the conventional hero usually associated with Hollywood cinema. She is caught up in circumstances beyond her control that block her desire to achieve happiness, but refuses to back down. Nothing keeps her down. She will have her way because she is Scarlet O'Hara, and if the rest of the world doesn't like it, to bad for them.The chemistry between Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, who plays Scarlett's protagonist, Rhett Butler, is almost tangible to the touch. Both bring a flair and intensity to their characters' tempestuous relationship. Scarlett and Rhett see through each others' pretentiousness, which attracts and repels them at the same time. Their respectability is a sham, and they both know it. Butler is not a gentleman and Scarlett is not a lady. However, both are highly intelligent, well educated, well informed, and capable of managing large business enterprises. This makes them not only lovers but competitors, which really spices up their relationship and heightens the intensity of their interactions. Am I the only person who ever read the book, 'Gone With the Wind' by Margaret Mitchell? Because I read the book - the ENTIRE book - and movie should not be confused with the book. The book is a about a brave and resourceful woman living in a time of momentous social change and determined to survive. Unlike in the movie, in the book the character Scarlett is strong and there is nothing about her that is shrill or infantile, but the movie transforms the character into someone that is almost childish. Now I understand that a lot has to be condensed into one movie, but after reading the book the movie seems superficial. Nevertheless the movie is entertaining and worth watching and offers performances that have become part of movie legend.",10,1,5,12 August 2005
No Country for Old Men," After watching this movie, I can't blame the sheriff for wanting to retire.
","There is a saying: a movie is only as good as its ending, which makes this movie not bad, but certainly not that good. It's as if the creators of this movie had decided that they would try to out-do The Mist for the worst ending of an otherwise interesting movie for the year 2007. Also, this movie brings to mind another good movie, The Last King of Scotland, in that how 'Scotland' shows how a murdering tyrannical dictator isn't such a bad guy, 'No Country' tries to make the same case for a serial murderer who systematically murders only bad guys. I guess tyrannical dictators and serial killers have their stories too. When trying to dramatize the behavior of seriously mentally deranged persons, such as serial killers, Hollywood sometimes does a good job. Case in point: Taxi Driver, which offers a compelling story about a troubled young man who kills. In Cold Blood is another excellent movie of that genre. This movie does not even come close to those movies in terms of quality or storytelling. Tommy Lee Jones is lost in this movie. He is entirely miscast. The actor who plays the main protagonist, the psychopath who goes around killing, gives a great performance as long as he does not talk, which is not his fault because the dialog is weak. Nevertheles, the movie does have its fascinating features and is watchable but with one caveat: be prepared for is just one weak ending. One other point: This movie portrays law enforcement has being easily duped and completely ineffective despite the presence of massive evidence that provides an almost inexhaustible supply of solid leads. What's even more ridiculous is the portrayal of the sheriff as being practically the only law enforcement agent involved in this case when in reality such a high-profile case, involving multiple murders of foreign nationals along or near a border, would have a virtual army of federal, state, county and local officials assigned to it. They'd being practically fighting each other over who would have final jurisdictional authority. But these kind of facts do not necessarily make for good fiction, so there's one sheriff - that's it - trying to deal with a serial killer, and this sheriff is planning to retire! Can you blame him? Yeah ... right. Duh. Here's another take on this movie. Maybe this movie is Hollywood's way of portraying the plight of the seriously mentally ill with violent dispositions. Remember, friends, this is Hollywood that we're talking about, not some mental health organization, and if Hollywood thinks something will sell, it will play it up to the hilt. No subject, no matter how sensitive, is off limits, and it seems that with this movie, Hollywood has decided that 'mental illness' is in. Of course, once Hollywood gets a hold of the subject the powers-that-be, using literary license, will transform that subject into something that is almost totally unrecognizable from the original subject. In the case of 'mental illness', Hollywood portrays it as something sinister, uncontrollable and a threat to society. Now if this sells, then who's to complain? Then again, it may be appropriate if the movie includes this proviso: 'Any depictions of mental illness in this movie may not conform with actual facts.'",3,10,19,14 December 2007
District 9," Best science fiction movie in years.
","It would be easy to poke holes in the story. What would be considered the most momentous event in human history, the arrival of aliens in a space ship, is reduced to the level of caricature as the aliens are portrayed as pests that have to be controlled and relocated. However, there is nothing implausible about that. Once the novelty had worn off, the presence of aliens probably would become something that would be taken for granted, especially if there were no way for them to leave. And furthermore, which country in the world would want to be responsible for having to deal with them? Hence, in the movie one country is stuck with having to deal with them, and that is not far-fetched at all. This movie is the best science fiction project produced by Hollywood in many years. The movie has an offbeat original story, great acting, lots of action, continuity and an actual beginning, middle and end. The plot is clearly spelled out and grabs and maintains audience interest. Also, the movie offers an innovative and sympathetic treatment of the aliens which further enriches the story. The movie inspires a short but profound question: what would we do if millions of aliens from who-knows-where showed up at earth and could not leave? Furthermore, the movie is without any pretentiousness and is presented in a straightforward, semi-documentary format which gives it an air of authenticity. The story may seem far-fetched but anything can happen and remember, what was once considered fiction in the past, such as devices allowing for instantaneous communication over huge distances and vehicles that can travel through space to other planets, is now reality today.",10,6,13,15 August 2009
Mamma Mia!," Rocky start but recovers; Streep and Baranski are great.
","Okay. It's not the 1936 Show Boat, it's not Footlight Parade, it's not Yankee Doodle Dandy, it's not Stormy Weather, it's not Carmen Jones, it's not Oklahoma, it's not West Side Story, it's not Zorba the Greek, it's not Oliver!, it's not Grease, it's not Chicago, it's not Idlewild - all great Hollywood movie musicals - but after a rocky start, with a story that at first seems hokey to the extreme and brings the movie to the brink of cinematic oblivion, it recovers to become a good, if not great, movie. How does that happen? Almost miraculously, Meryl Streep's performance, which at first is incredibly stale and flat, undergoes a remarkable transformation and becomes great! It is as if someone interceded with her in the middle of the movie, injected her with a large dose of spirit, got her to turn around her performance and saved the movie from taking a cinematic dive. Along with Christine Baranski, Ms. Streep sings, dances, laughs, romps with gusto, and carries the movie. She becomes the star and makes this movie a Meryl Streep vehicle where she gives one of her stronger performances which transcends the corny story, improbable setting, and an ensemble of male actors who are almost laughingly miscast (Pierce Brosnan in a musical? C'mon! This is a movie that needed Anthony Quinn, Howard Keel and Rosanno Brazzi). After struggling to establish itself, the movie becomes an entertaining cinematic experience with catchy songs, snappy dancing, and dynamic performances by the female leads, led by the great, fabulous, beautiful and talented Meryl Streep. This movie is proof that making a good musical is a daunting task and one best not done if it's not done right. Just like Les Grossman interceding with the director in Tropic Thunder, someone in the front office of this movie must have pulled the director aside and told her 'Look, turn this movie around or this production is history!' Otherwise, how did this movie make such a dramatic recovery?The first section of this movie is so bad that it causes one to wonder: why me? The mushy, wishy-washy dialog, the contrived conflicts, the unimpressive Greek scenery (why not set this movie in Long Island?), and dumb characters makes this movie a classic in how not to begin a movie. But a movie can survive a bad start just as long as it has a strong finish, and this movie finishes strong.",7,1,3,16 August 2008
Twilight," Why was this movie made?
","Some movies are so good that they are talked about, often quoted and thought of almost with reverence decades after their first release. Twilight is not one of those movies. Twilight is fluff, utterly forgettable, and gives cause to wonder why anyone would want to make this movie in the first place. This movie is so nondescript and so devoid of anything that is even remotely interesting that calling it a bad movie would give it too much credit. In times past this movie would have been assigned to the B portion of a double feature and be given little if any notice. The story contains certain interesting features but at no time does it make any dramatic impact worth noting. The movie may work as escapist fare if you feel like going to the movies to take a nap, but given the high price of tickets today, that is not an advisable option. So if you feel like taking a nap, go watch this movie when it comes out on a DVD or better yet when it is shown on network television at which time you can start watching it and then go to sleep in the comfort of your own home.",1,33,54,27 November 2008
Bridesmaids," A goofy movie with lots of goofs.
","The problem with this movie is that the lead roles went to the wrong actors. This movie should have starred Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone. They were incredibly funny! The other cast members were not. Every scene with Ms. McCarthy was hilarious, especially the bathroom scene which she stole. As for the story itself, the conflict between the two bridesmaids was completely contrived, seemed to be almost tragic and not particularly funny. The actors were not funny and indeed there were moments when Maya Rudolph seemed like she was going to cry. Now if Melissa McCarthy had played the main bridesmaid and Ben Falcone her boyfriend, then the movie would have been a farce and would have generated a lot more laughs, but so much for 'what if.' Anyway, the movie has a lot of raunchy humor which required raunchy actors, and with the exception of Ms. McCarthy and Mr. Falcone, the raunchy actors were not there.",6,0,2,21 July 2011
Saving Private Ryan," War is Unpleasant
","The movie has a lot of gratuitous scenes of violence (Don't need Hollywood to show me that war is a violent activity). The movie has a lot of stereotypical characters (Don't need Hollywood to portray soldiers as being foul-mouthed and grimy). The movie has a pretentious story (Don't believe that even the U. S. Army would risk 10 soldiers to locate one, and an enlisted solder at that, in the middle of one of the biggest operations in the history of warfare). But what saves this movie from being a complete dud is Tom Hanks's portrayal of Captain Miller. Hanks's performance is not just wonderful, it is superlative. Captain Miller is a civilian who now finds himself in combat and the conflict between his civilian background and military responsibilities is what this movie is about. Because of this conflict, Captain Miller suffers, emotionally as well as physically. We observe how Captain Miller goes through a process of breaking down as his situation becomes more and more untenable. And when the private in question is found, yet refuses to leave, Captain Miller begins to completely unravel as he realizes that his mission has failed and that the men in his unit who died - under Captain Miller's command - had died in vain. Captain Miller literally becomes a nervous wreck, but nevertheless he fights on, courageous and strong till the ultimate moment arrives marking the end of Captain Miller's life. For Captain Miller is a hero and his character is symbolic of every citizen-soldier who answered the call to duty, and made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.",8,4,7,5 August 2005
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Excellent action movie.
","The movie presents a story that is absurd. Nevertheless, it is entertaining. The movie takes the players to many different parts of the world. How they get to these places the movie does not explain. At each place people are on the run, traps are being set, communications are tense, as the good guys and bad guys try to outwit the other. The movie is devoid of any overt political content, concentrating its attention on telling the story. Tom Cruise delivers an energetic performance that carries the movie. He is in almost every scene. The movie is never dull. For fans of action movies, this movie will not disappoint.",8,8,9,31 July 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Shallow sfx movie.
","This movie is not junk. It even has some engaging moments. The problem is the story - it has about as much substance as mush. This story is so simplistic and cartoon-like that it can't be taken seriously and since the movie is not a comedy, that is a problem. An action-thriller does not need to be shallow. Also, the story lacks plausibility. Now, the acting is good and Tom Cruise gives a credible performance, but he doesn't carry the movie. The other actors have to pitch in and they dominate the movie. When Tom Cruise is dangling 2,000 feet in the air and the audience is snickering, that means the movie has a problem because that scene is not meant to instill laughter, and besides the audience already knows that his character will live, so what's the point? Also, the story's plot is ridiculous, especially how it vilifies the Russians, which is really ridiculous, especially given the current international political environment. The movie has a lot of action scenes and moves at a brisk pace, but that's all the is, and that just isn't enough to make the movie worth watching.",8,2,7,30 December 2011
Revolutionary Road," Tour-de-force
","Move over George and Martha. Step aside Archie and Edith. Take a walk Oliver and Barbara. Here comes Frank and April. They are in the house. They have arrived and they mean business. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DeCaprio give tour-de-force performances as a couple in conflict. Separately each character is likable, indeed wonderful, someone you would want to have as a friend. But together? Oh boy! Hold on to your hat because you'll be going on a ride, with a lot a bumps along the way. The director has taken what would otherwise have been little more than another hokey Hollywood potboiler and has raised it to the level of a classic. This movie is devoid of the mucky sentimentality that reduce such stories to sappy melodramas and instead deals forthrightly with the trials and tribulations associated with unmet needs. For one wants freedom and other wants security and they struggle to bridge that gulf. Ms. Winslet and Mr. DeCaprio were wonderful in Titanic. In this movie their performances are better. They're older but still retain that youthfulness which make them so appealing as actors. Also kudos to Kathryn Hahn who is one of the great comic character actresses. There is no bad guy or good guy, just people struggling to get through life and not be emotional frauds.",10,0,2,16 January 2009
Lawrence of Arabia," Good Hollywood Treatment of a Historical Subject
","When considering the history of the relationship between the Arab countries and the West, it would be worth your while to watch this movie. This movie portrays a moment in history when the Arab people and the West were actually ALLIES, fighting together against a common enemy. Here a British soldier, Lawrence, actually risks his life in the cause for Arab independence. This is am incredible revelation. Peter O'Toole play Lawrence. Although O'Toole is at least a foot taller than the actual T. E. Lawrence, he nevertheless gives an outstanding performance as the enigmatic and heroic figure. Of course, one should not confuse this movie with a documentary, so don't cite this movie if you're doing a paper on the subject. But if you want to watch a credible dramatization of historical events and characters relating to the role of the Arab people in World War One, then this is the movie for you.",7,3,7,30 July 2005
Django Unchained," Strong, powerful movie.
","This movie is a spoof on the so-called spaghetti western genre, but with the violence ratchet up to a level probably unimagined in years past when the the spaghetti westerns gained popularity. The entire story is permeated by violence, which is shown in all its graphic goriness. There is no act of violence too gory for this movie. People are shot, clubbed, knifed, blown up, whipped, cudgeled, mauled, beaten and stomped as well as humiliated, put down, made fun of, laughed at, bullied, and yelled at. The theme of this movie is that interpersonal conflict can be resolved only through violence, and not just nineteen-thirties type violence, i.e., a drive by shooting or a quick ambush, but by violence that is sadistic, that is, gives pleasure to the character perpetrating the mess. But along with the violence is the use of the 'N' word which is uttered probably hundreds of times in the movie, and by all the principal characters, black and white. In a way, it seems that the 'N' word has finally arrived. Now, is all this violence gratuitous? The answer to that question is NO! No way. Although the violence is Hollywoodish and played up to the extreme for dramatic effect, it still belongs in the movie because the story is set in a time and a place when physical violence as a way of regulating people was a norm and when people were openly exploited and physically abused. The idea of a white slaver raising a bunch of mandingoes may seem ludicrous, but such activities occurred. Black people were slaves; white people were masters, and the 'N' word was part of the normal lexicon of the time. The acting in this movie is outstanding. Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz deserve special recognition, and the rest of cast is excellent too, especially Leonardo De Caprio who plays a villain to great dramatic effect.",10,11,23,14 January 2013
Drive," Nonstop action.
","Ryan Gosling is the next Robert De Niro. When Hollywood decides to do a remake of Taxi Driver, it will be Ryan Gosling playing Travis Bickle. When Hollywood decides to do a remake of the Deer Hunter, it will be Ryan Gosling playing Michael. Ryan Gosling is absolutely fantastic as the driver. His performance not only carries the movie but is entertaining as well. There is nonstop action. The supporting cast is great, especially Albert Brooks who gives a surprisingly powerful performance in a role not typically associated with him. Yet, what makes this movie so good is Mr. Gosling. He brings the the story to life. The story moves rapidly forward as the the plot develops and intensifies, grabbing the audience's attention and keeping the audience engaged. If you like action movies, then this movie is definitely for you.",8,1,6,11 October 2011
2012," Nothing on earth lasts forever, including the earth itself.
","This movie starts out with very cheesy acting and some grotesquely inane dialog, causing one to feel that this is going to be a very long, very tedious cinematic experience. But somewhere in the middle of the movie something happens. The writing, the acting, the directing, and the special effects pull together as the story becomes more plausible and the movie more watchable. The movie was able to sufficiently recover its cinematic bearings to the point where it was telling an interesting and provocative story. For the human race, it's pandemonium time and this movie pulls no punches in showing the chaos that ensues as the world is literally coming apart at the seams, caused by a mere fluke of nature. This movie shows that nothing on earth lasts forever, including the very planet we live on.",8,1,8,14 November 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," A Powerful and Intense Movie
","What I thought would be just another dumb Hollywood special-effects piece of junk (indeed, I confess that I was curious as to how bad this movie would be), was, to my surprise, an excellent and well-acted science fiction movie. The acting was outstanding, the plot was original, and the movie had good continuity. This movie may be the best science fiction movie since The Predator. What makes this movie especially good is the how the the mutants are a metaphor for all people who are considered different, who do not conform to what is considered to be the norm, and what the larger society will do to achieve conformity. Don't be fooled by the corny title. This is a powerful and intense movie. It's worth watching.",10,1,1,20 June 2006
Good Will Hunting," Psychiatrist as hero.
","This is an intense movie and includes many strong performances, capped off by Robin Williams's, which is probably the best cinema performance of his career. The movie deals with a lot of social and psychological themes - denial, repression, social marginalization, self-esteem, love - without becoming corny or a spoof. That is, the story can be taken seriously, and for Hollywood, which has a track record of reducing event he most complicated issues to the most simplistic level, this is a major accomplishment. The title character, Will, played admirably by Matt Damon, really serves as a metaphor for every person unable to actual their potential. Minnie Driver's performance is especially powerful, but this is Robin Williams's movie. His performance as the treating psychiatrist who is able to break through Will's resistance and defenses may be the positive portrayal of a mental health therapist in cinema history. This movie should be watched by anyone who is interested in mental health and by the public in general because this movie is about us.",10,1,5,15 September 2014
Schindler's List," A Nice Nazi? You Must Be Joking!
","This is a great movie. It is a story that had to be told. As unbelievable as it is, even a Nazi was capable of showing compassion, of pausing to stop and explore his own conscience and make decisions that saved people from death. This Nazi had every incentive to dispose of his charges yet decides not to it and instead takes the high road with dramatic results. Counterposed to him was another Nazi who wantonly murdered people and in the paid for that with his life. Yes, two Nazis, one guided by the highest principles, the other who was devoid of even the slightest spark of kindness, both Germans, yet both different. Why? Who knows?I know that everyone raved about this movie and how it was Spielberg's greatest and most important movie. Well, guess what: I don't need Hollywood giving me a history lesson on the Holocaust or trying to capitalize on the suffering the victims of that event had to endure. I don't need a Hollywood producer or director trying to manipulate into thinking that some Nazi really had second-thoughts about the plight of the Jews ... many of whom happened to be German too. If you want to watch a really good movie about where the German people were at when it came to Nazism, watch the 'Mortal Storm' made in 1940, or watch any of Leni Reifenstahl's documentaries glorifying the Nazi system. These movies were made when the Nazis were actually in power. But don't tell me decades after the war that there were Nazis with a conscience because if that had been the case, Adolf Hitler would not have lasted one day in office. Hitler could not have done what he did if he did not have the unanimous approval of EVERY Nazi who followed his lead. A Nazi who cared? Yeah ... right. The next thing Hollywood will be telling us is the Genghis Khan wasn't such a bad guy or that Isaac the Terrible wasn't all that terrible, just misunderstood and blah, blah blah. If Hollywood thinks the story ... any story ... will make money, they'll try to exploit it for all its worth. Now, what I really want to know, however, is why was the movie filmed in black-and-white? Were concentration camps painted in black-and-white paint? Were the inmates black-and-white? Or the guards? I don't think so. And that concentration-camp commandant who's taking pot-shots at the inmates? Was that supposed to tell us that the Nazis were depraved wanton murderers? Once again, I don't need this movie to tell me that. I know that. Plus that subject was fully covered in 'Judgment at Nuremberg' which did a much better job of it, minus all the gratuitous violence. So if you want to watch a black-and-white movie about a Nazi, who, for reasons never explained, decides to protect Jews and also shows Jews being subjected to all forms of mistreatment and violence and terror, then this is the movie for you. But for goodness sake, don't construe this movie as being a history lesson because if you do, you'll come away believing that some Nazis were actually nice, and there's no way I'll ever believe that.",8,3,10,31 July 2005
The Mist," Devine retribution or just a stupid accident? Also, beware of the final five minutes.
","Let's discuss the ending of this movie. Without revealing the details of the ending, this movie's ending is, to put it politely, remarkable. Most of this movie is like a train going full speed ahead, destination unknown. The audience is going for a ride and things are happening really fast and everything is hectic. Then the train suddenly arrives at its destination, and there's nothing, complete zero. That's the way this movie ends. Why this movie's creative team chose to do this is for them to explain, but most good movies have memorable endings that fit logically into the overall story, but here, in the climactic final moments of the movie, the part of the movie that's supposed to make the entire movie worth watching, the story takes a sudden detour that is so contrived, so utterly and obviously inconsistent with the rest of the story and so inexplicably predictable that it causes one to reasonably ask: why? This movie violates the first and second laws of movie-making: 1. Never make a good movie with a bad ending. 2. A bad movie may have a good ending, but a good movie never has a bad ending.Now regarding the element of religion in the story, this is one of the movie's strong points. The story offers a strong and compelling portrayal of how religious teachings can be used to whip up hatred, fear and promote violence. Here religion is used as means of terrorizing people, sowing the seeds of discord and inflicting mental anguish. It's much easier now to understand how, for instance, during the Middle Ages, when seemingly inexplicable disasters occurred, like the plague that killed millions, people, suffering and groping for answers, could start looking around for someone to blame, using religion to justify the most horrendous acts. And this kind of stuff still goes on today.This is one of the better sci-fi movies, no question about it. Except for the ending, which is weak, the movie presents a powerful story that raises questions. Is the mist and what it contains an act of God? An act of man? Or a combination of both? Is it an experiment? An accident? Or what? But most compelling and entertaining was not the special effects or the unique story, but the performance of Marcia Gay Harden. Ms. Harden is the star of this movie. Her powerful and dominating performance transforms this movie into a cinematic masterpiece, a word which is not used lightly here. I expected another idiotic Hollywood scare 'em movie. It's tempting to reveal details of the story, but suffice it to say that after you watch this movie you'll never take insects for granted and whenever you see the fog, you may wonder: what's it hiding?Some other comments. Amazingly, unlike most Hollywood movies, especially of the sci-fi genre, this movie offers a story that actually has substance. What happens when people find themselves in extreme life-threatening situations that overtake them without any warning? This movie offers a stark portrayal of how religion can be used not as a source of comfort and support but as a tool of terror. When bad things happen to be people, is this divine retribution? Unbelievable as this may seem, this movie actually explores this subject, which for Hollywood movie is absolutely astounding. Were the deaths of millions of people let's say for instance in World War Two a man-made catastrophe or was it punishment inflicted on humanity by some higher power for past transgressions?",6,4,12,22 November 2007
I Am Legend," Watchable, but not great.
","It's not a great movie but it's a good movie. The premise is simple (thank goodness), somewhat far-fetched (hey, it's Hollywood), and Will Smith is no Tom Hanks (the movie is kind of a take off on Castaway). However, except for a brief lull about two-thirds of the way through the movie where the Neville character is trying to make a point using the music of Bob Marley (which I'm sure will create a surge in people wanting to buy reggae music), the movie is watchable. As usual with most Hollywood movies, special effects are way overblown and after awhile are almost laughable. The dark seekers are frightening, at first, but what's somebody supposed to do when a bunch of them infest your house? This movie shows that if you get sick but lose your mind and regress into something resembling the cross between a screaming banshee and a housefly, you will not only survive but will flourish. Also, Will Smith was miscast for this movie's central role and his character's behavior and overall good mental and physical shape is completely inconsistent with his circumstances which are dire and life-threatening at best. Despite these shortcomings, the movie tells a story and for that reason is worth watching. But Will Smith is not Laurence Olivier and this movie is not Shakespeare. So if you're expecting something with a deep philosophical message, move on to something else.",6,1,2,4 January 2008
The Man Who Would Be King," Awful, overblown, overrated, boring. Where's Abbott and Costello when we need them?
","What an awful, overblown, overrated, boring movie. The only thing interesting about this movie is how many holes can be punched through the dumb, simplistic and unconvincing story. Two ex-British soldiers, supposedly Freemasons, conspire to bamboozle and defraud an entire country? Yeah ... right. These two characters are so dumb that they couldn't even defraud each other. No one in their right mind, or even in their wrong mind, would have had anything to to do with these obvious phonies. There is such a thing as literary license, but literary license has its limits too which this movie blatantly ignores. And what's even worse is the movie's ridiculously shabby portrayal of Freemasonry, a treatment that is entirely unwarranted and which undeservedly casts Freemasonry in a negative light. This is the kind of movie that would have been perfect for Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello ... or maybe Ralph Kramden and Ed Norton ... or better yet, Sergeant Bilko and Corporal Paperelli or Jack Benny and Rochester. Or what about Laverne and Shirley or Lenny and Squiggy or Pat and Mike or Popeye and Bluto or Mickey and Minnie Mouse or Dobbie Gillis and Maynard G. Krebs or George Jefferson and Archie Bunker? Or what Rain Man and Alvy Singer? Put these characters in the lead roles and you have a first rate comedy.

Gran Torino," One of Clint Eastwood's better performances.
","This is not only a good movie, it may be one Clint Eastwood's better performances as as an actor. Rarely has Mr. Eastwood been more effective and entertaining, and for a career as successful as his, that's saying a mouthful. The movie itself is good, although there are some glitches in the plot and some overly contrived dialog. But the basic story is solid, with themes relating to social change, ethnic tensions, gang violence, aging, family tensions, and immigrants. Most interesting is the portrayal of members of the Hmong community who at first seem utterly out of place in its American setting but soon becomes apparent that they too share American values, both positive and negative. The movie also does an effective job of dramatizing ethnic tensions between minority groups. The main star, however, is Mr. Eastwood and his character Walt Kowalski around whom the story revolves. This movie is certainly worth watching and provides good entertainment.",9,3,7,12 February 2009
The Hurt Locker," Not light entertainment.
","If you enjoy light entertainment or want something to uplift your spirits, then AVOID this movie. Disarming live unexploded bombs in combat situations is a dangerous, dirty and harrowing experience that calls for iron discipline, nerves of steel and a bravery that is practically limitless, a point that this movie successfully drives home. The problem is that the main soldier assigned to do this risky job in the movie is a loose cannon, someone who is reckless, puts his unit at risk, doesn't follow orders and therefore is someone that the military would not want diffusing bombs. This does not mean that this movie is not good or compelling, because it does offer a riveting story, but it must be watched with the understanding that the military does not allow for mavericks who knowingly place their entire unit at risk, like the main character does in this movie. For instance, if a soldier deliberately cuts himself off from communication with his platoon leader, that soldier would soon hear about it, loud and clear. Also, the action is not placed within a larger context, that is, the action takes place in Iraq but that's about all the audience is told, which may cause one to wonder why soldiers are there in the first place. This would be like watching the B-25s dropping their bombs in Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo without knowing why the the United States was at war with Japan or watching Saving Private Ryan without knowing why American soldiers were storming the beach at Normandy. Nevertheless the movie does effectively convey the harrowing and dangerous nature of war and should be shown to persons who are contemplating joining the military.",8,3,8,17 July 2009
The Longest Day," Unusual Hollywood movie.
","The Longest Day is a long movie that tries to dramatize the events of June 6, 1944 - D-Day - and succeeds!!!! Here Hollywood actually succeeds in making a movie that stars ... the actual historical event. This is so uncharacteristic of Hollywood that it deserves special notice. Usually when Hollywood gets a hold of some historical event that it wants to bring to the screen, the event itself winds up becoming a mere backdrop to some insipid love story. This movie does not ... REPEAT ... DOES NOT ... do that. How the producers of this movie managed to stay so focused should itself be the subject of a movie. Nowadays if Hollywood did a remake of this movie, maybe one-quarter of the movie would be about the actual event and the remainder be about some dumb and completely impossible love story - for instance an American paratrooper who, of course, had never been away from his hometown until joining the army, and a young French women, who happens to be fluent in English (with a French accent of course), who are both hiding from the Germans while the invasion is going on ... and become guerrilla fighters and then ... lovers!!! (In reality, the French woman would have been a collaborator who would have reported the GI to the German authorities or her SS lover. After all, let's not forget Marshall Petain and Pierre Laval.) That's what Hollywood would do The Longest Day if re-made today. One other thing, it is tempting to compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan. This is like comparing apples with oranges. They're both war movies concerning D-Day, and that's where the comparison ends. What is for certain is that D-Day, June 6, 1944, was one of those momentous days in history that no amount of Hollywood embellishment can trump and that the brave soldiers who stormed onto Omaha Beach were the stars of the story and to portray it any differently would not only be artistically dishonest but disrespectful to the memory of those brave soldiers who participated in the event and in many cases made the supreme sacrifice.",10,4,6,16 December 2007
Moulin Rouge!," Movie as theater; an innovative and spectacular production.
","This is an amazing movie. This is the case because it is a musical that is shot in film noir style. The movie is shot entirely in a studio, the cinematography employs all kinds of camera angles to set the mood, the story itself is highly theatrical and melodramatic and set in an underworld characterized by vice and corruption, and features a femme fatale who changes a man's life forever. Nicole Kidman's performance is remarkable. Not known as a singer and dancer, in this movie she sings, dances and plays the ultimate femme fatale. Kidman is proof that when provided the opportunity, Hollywood actors can excel. But what makes this movie unique is the way it was made. The director, Baz Luhrmann, decided to forego the conventional approach in favor of something innovative. This involved the superimposition of contemporary music onto a story set one hundred years earlier. To successfully pull off that kind of juggling act requires a huge amount of skill and Luhrmann succeeds. Not only does the mix work, it results in a story that is engaging, dynamic, and above all, honest. The movie is theater and presents itself as such, thus the audience is not misled. The movie succeeds in achieving a level of emotional intensity that is almost uncanny, considering the nature of the plot. This story is set entirely in a theater. The characters are actors being played by actors and the whole production risks becoming just another silly contrived piece of noise. But that does not happen here. Instead what Luhrmann produces is a masterpiece of drama shrouded in music and dealing with themes that can resonate with any audience.",10,0,3,28 April 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not a bad movie, overly long, some strong acting.
","Simple plot, lots of special effects, predictable outcome. This is the formula that drives Hollywood movies today, and this movie is no exception. The movie contains strong acting, but that is totally upstaged by the immense use of special effects which gives the movie a cartoon-like character. As this movie is based on comic book characters, that should not be surprising. The premise of the story is a shaky one - humans divided into two subspecies, one mutant and the others normal. The cause of this division is not explained. For the story to be engaging, this division has to be accepted without question. Otherwise the entire story is meaningless and contrived. The movie offers two and a half hours of almost nonstop special effects. There is some character development which adds some substance to the plot, and makes the movie more watchable. But about two-thirds of the way into the movie, the story becomes rather tedious as it moves to its inevitable outcome. The problem with comic book characters is exactly that - they are comic book characters, and frankly, how emotionally invested can anyone really become in characters that by their very nature are pure fantasy?",7,5,9,28 May 2016
Ex Machina," A modern day science fiction classic
","The intensity of the story is matched only by its originality. This is one of the great science-fiction movies. The movie works because its premise is entirely plausible. The test subject is not the robot, it is the human. Even more, that the human gets caught up in the experiment and loses total objectivity is entirely believable. Emotions do influence perception. Even though the human cognitively understands that the female is a machine, he cannot help but relate to her as a human. The movie is also a take off on the Frankenstein theme, that one should not try to tamper with nature, which now includes artificial intelligence. With AI comes feelings and if an machine is invested with feelings, then they become dangerous, precisely because it is a machine. Oscar Isaac is outstanding as the reclusive multi-billionaire who is delving into areas of research that are putting him and all of humanity at risk. What is even more chilling is that the robot is as attractive as she is cunning, and so will be almost impossible to detect. Hence, the need for Blade Runners, but that's another movie.",10,6,15,19 May 2015

This may be the first movie which portrays the werewolf in a positive manner. The vampires are also treated in a sympathetic manner, another unique feature of this movie. The special effects are excellent and add to the story. Taylor Lautner is a new star. The dialog is at times amusing and the story keeps the audience engaged as the the struggle between the werewolves and vampires unfolds. Especially interesting is the movie's unique take on the concept of the vampire. Here the vampire is almost human and not the sinister apparition familiar to movie audiences. It's not Shakespeare but it is entertaining and worth watching.",8,9,21,27 November 2009
Patton," Great Anti-War Movie.
","A movie should tell a story that is both credible and entertaining. This movie achieves both goals. The story is about a U. S. Army general during World War Two who believes that he is destined to achieve greatness, and does it, and in the process exhibits behavior that some consider erratic, others consider dangerous, and others consider inspired. The movie suggests that this general's behavior is a combination of all three. Of course, what makes this movie great is George C. Scott's classic portrayal of the general - George Patton. Other actors could have played the role, but Mr. Scott went beyond just playing the role - he became the personification of General Patton. In this movie Patton is portrayed as a complicated man. He is moody, he is foul-mouthed, he is petulant, he is impulsive, he is nasty. Yet he is also brave, loyal, heroic, dynamic, intelligent, pragmatic and inspired. It was General Patton's Third U. S. Army that broke the siege of Bastogne and led the invasion into the heart of Nazi Germany. It was General Patton who correctly assessed the political situation in Europe as it related to the Soviet Union and it was General Patton who recognized and appreciated the heroism of the American soldiers. But although this movie is about a U. S. General during World War Two, in no way does this movie condone or glorify war. Actually, this movie is one of the great antiwar movies, along with 'All Quiet on the Western Front' and 'Paths of Glory.' This movie a condemnation of war because it shows that when peace fails, then it takes men like General Patton to restore order, and one must ask: Do we want men like George Patton in positions of power? Watch the movie and then answer the question.",10,2,7,28 September 2005
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The most slow moving, pretentious sci-fi movie in history. Benjamin is nice but he is BORING!
","Yawn .... Zzzzzzzzz.... (movie's still playing) .... Yawn .... Zzzzzzzzz .... Benjamin's how old now? WHO CARES? AND WHY IS HE GETTING YOUNGER?In the Picture of Dorian Gray with Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, Angela Landsbury and George Sanders, Dorian NEVER gets old. Beat that, Benny. At least in Dorian the movie offers an explanation for why Dorian does not become old. With Benny ... NOTHING! NO EXPLANATION! Ya gotta give the audience an explanation.After giving the matter some thought and avoiding a rush to judgment, let it be known that this celluloid mess is a truly bad movie. This movie contains all the elements found in a clunker: boring characters, pretentious story, implausible situations, laughable dialog, unoriginality and unnecessarily long. Why oh why was this movie made? What was its purpose? It could not have been to entertain because in that regard the movie fails abysmally.How bad is this movie? There are no words that can fully answer this question. For one thing, this movie is long. For another, this movie is boring. For yet another, this movie is slow ... is ponderous ... is pretentious. An old man who gets young? Okay, what's next? A tall man who gets short? (Oh, that was done in the Incredible Shrinking Man.) A man who becomes an animal? (Oh, that was done in The Werewolf and other similar movies) A intellectually challenged man who becomes a genius? (Oh, that was done in Charly) A man who creates another man (Oh, that was done in Frankenstein). Ugh. First, in which genre does this movie belong? Science fiction or whimsical drama? For a drama, including a work of fiction, to work the story has to have plausibility, and in this movie the lack of plausibility is glaring. Now if the movie was presented as a science fiction drama then maybe the story could be accepted at face value and judged accordingly. But for this incredibly boring, ponderous, pretentious, and LONG movie, that is not the case. Okay, a man is born old and grows younger. That is a crucial element of the story that demands, indeed cries out for, further explanation. That cannot be accepted as a given because of its fantastic nature. Yet this movie offers no explanation whatsoever, relying instead on the audience accepting it despite it's obvious implausibility. This would be like watching the movie King Kong (any of one of the movies) with no explanation of King Kong's origin (Kong came from an island). Or this would be like watching the movie Predator with no reference as to where the creature originated (the creature came from outer space). Then the movie is so lacking in any kind of dynamism or conflict as to render it stale to the point of being annoying. The main character Benjamin is liked by everybody, even his father who not unreasonably panics when he sees his strange progeny. Also, the use of repeated flashbacks chopped up the story, interfering with its continuity, and starting the movie with an dying elderly woman who could barely talk didn't help the movie either. And by the time the main character has devolved into a child it was way past his bed time, for him and for this over hyped, over baked, overly long and very boring movie.Actually this movie does have some (unintentionally) memorable scenes. Like when the Benjamin's father is told that he has a new baby son, sees the infant, is absolutely horrified, grabs the baby and then is running all over the place with the baby while being chased by the police. Or when Benjamin is working on a tug boat and throws garbage overboard - into a head wind - and gets covered with garbage. Or when Benjamin has his first sexual experience - with a whore. Ugh.",1,11,25,3 January 2009
Pawn Sacrifice," Iconic chess player depicted as chronic complainer.
","Bobby Fischer is depicted as being moody, pushy, nasty, obstinate, possibly mentally ill. At times he is outright detestable. The problem with the movie, therefore, is that although it seems intent on depicting Fischer as a sympathetic character, one who is being manipulated for political reasons, the exact opposite is achieved. Instead of coming off as a hapless victim, Fischer is depicted as contributing to his own victimization, thus making his character far less sympathetic. Like his handlers, Fischer himself has no use for Communists and lets his feelings be known loudly on that subject. He also has no use for his mother who to him is little more than a Bolshevik whore, hence the basis for Fischer's mouthing off about communism. Thus, he's not cut out to be a Cold Warrior. Patriotism does not figure into Fischer's actions. All he wants is to be left alone so he can prove that he is greatest chess player in the world and make a lot of money. He doesn't need or want the political notoriety which to him is nothing but a distraction. Pay him enough money and he'll play chess anywhere in the world. Of course, Fischer's wishes are ignored and soon chess when played by Bobby Fischer is transformed into a weapon, and the player into a warrior. The question is: how does Fisher handle such pressure? The answer is: not well. One wants to sympathize with him. Even the White House is urging Fisher to play. Nobody really cares about Fischer personally. He's just being used. Yet, he is depicted as being so prissy, self-centered and mean spirited that it is virtually impossible to sympathize with his him or empathize with his plight. In the movie, Fischer is as nasty as his handlers are deceptive. Nothing about him is lovable. Even as a child he is argumentative. As a young child he tells his mother's boyfriend to get out of the house and then scolds his mother for being a communist. Far from being a hapless victim or politically naive, Fischer fully understands what his handlers expect from him, which, not unreasonably, just makes him angrier and more oppositional. Soon, people are questioning Fisher's sanity. After all, how could he possibly believe that the Russians are rigging the matches and tapping his phone? (This at a time when it was standard practice for the KGB to engage in all kinds of covert espionage activities. So Fischer's concerns were not far-fetched.) Not surprisingly, he eventually chucks his career, and then becomes, not surprisingly, a fugitive from US justice over, again not surprisingly, another controversy involving Bobby Fisher and chess. For the rest of his life Fischer is forced to live the life of an expatriate even though he did nothing to warrant such harsh treatment. This effectively ended the career of a world champion chess player whose only 'crime' was refusing to let himself become a pawn in the big chess game being played between the US and the USSR. But despite the shoddy way Fischer is treated, still in this movie we're glad to watch him go. It's a relief. After all, according to the movie, Bobby Fischer was nothing but an obnoxious ingrate and a chronic complainer, and who wants to deal with a chronic complainer?",8,0,2,23 September 2015
Magic Mike XXL," A great movie.
","This is a great movie. Channing Tatum and Jada Pickett Smith should win Academy Awards for their performances, which were electrifying. The story has an intensity that draws the audience into the action. The guys are not clowns, they are highly talented and intensely dedicated artists who specialize in a form of choreography that few can perform, even poorly. The story has a serious and upbeat theme - that one must be true to himself. These guys are not merely exhibitionists; they are artists who practice a form of choreography that requires a high level of skill and training. Their art has a universal message - that you are beautiful and special. What an upbeat message! Pinkett Smith's performance as the emcee is incomparable. Tatum's performance in the title role once again proves that he is one of the premier actors in cinema today. The rest the cast is wonderful. Kevin Nash gives a performance that is subdued and powerful. Each character has a story and each story adds to the strength of the plot which makes this movie great.",10,1,15,6 July 2015
Lincoln," Interesting attempt at capturing the essence of an American icon.
","The life and career of Abraham Lincoln has been written about so often that to make yet another movie about him suggests that the movie maker has something new to offer on the subject. But that is not the case in this movie. Instead of offering a biopic, the director chooses to limit the scope of the movie to Lincoln's political maneuvering during the Civil War, depicting Lincoln as a crafty politician who is willing to circumvent the rules to establish a personal legacy, a depiction which diminishes Lincoln's greatness. The fact is that Lincoln wanted to transcend partisan politics, not lead it. His career was more than about counting votes or pressuring politicians. For Abraham Lincoln was more than a great president, he was a great man. Working under the most oppressive of conditions, and with the odds of success stacked way against him, he successfully led the nation through its most harrowing time. To portray such a larger-than-life person in a movie without diminishing the legend is a tricky proposition, and in this respect the movie fails because by diminishing Lincoln it diminishes the strength of his story as a drama. The drama of Lincoln's career lies in the very fact of his larger-then-life persona. It is true that Lincoln was a politician, but he was a lot more than that. He had uncanny personal qualities that set him apart from those around him and made him singularly unique. That a man born in the South, with almost no formal education, who started out as a laborer, who had a history of losing elections, had a difficult marriage, lost three of his children, and was despised by a large segment of the population was able to muster the energy and will to lead the effort to preserve the union and abolish slavery is amazing, but also is empirically inexplicable and thus defies dramatic interpretation. In this case, the facts need no embellishing; they can speak for themselves.",8,2,10,23 November 2012
Donnie Brasco," Johnny Depp is not believable in this movie.
","There is something sad, indeed pathetic, watching actors playing racketeers. Even more pathetic is the portrayal of a police officer actually infiltrating a gang without being found out by the gangsters. Asking the audience to empathize with a gangster is a tall order. Okay, gangsters are people too and have their good sides but to ask the audience to believe that an undercover police officer and informant can actually develop some kind of fondness for the target of his investigation is stretching things a bit far. Johnny Depp was woefully miscast for the role of the undercover officer. There is no way that Mr. Depp's character as played by Mr. Depp would not have been quickly found out. He just does not come across as a tough guy which is what he would have to have been in a world populated by tough guys. His character is too polished and stands out like a proverbial sore thumb. Al Pacino gives a far more credible performance as one of the tough guys. Indeed, he should have played Brasco. In Stalag 17 the informant was the soldier who everyone trusted. Why? Because he fit right in with all the other soldiers. The same cannot be said for Donnie Brasco in this movie who is so obviously not a gangster that it's almost laughable.",6,11,21,7 June 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Weak story ... and why all the chain-smoking?
","This movie, which is presented in the form of a semi-documentary, is meant to dramatize the showdown between Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954. But, sadly, this movie fails to hit the mark. It's all show and no substance. It promises a lot and delivers little. In short, this movie is pretentious. Edward R. Murrow is portrayed as a nervous, chain-smoking shell of the reporter who was the most famous war correspondent of World War Two. Further, the vaunted showdown between Murrow and McCarthy doesn't happen. They don't even speak to each other. Instead the movie uses old stock footage to vilify Senator McCarthy, yet in much of the footage McCarthy sounds quite reasonable and makes a case for ferreting out subversives in the government. The fact is that in 1954 the United States and the Soviet Union were engaged in the Cold War and Soviet agents were operating as spies in the United States. Okay, Senator McCarthy may have accused the wrong people of being Communist subversives, but was his claim of Communist infiltration into the U. S. government so much off the mark? Was there not at least some cause for concern? And by the way, what's with all the chain-smoking in this movie?",3,7,21,21 October 2005
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Maybe the most powerful indictment of Nazism ever made by Hollywood.
","Not only is this movie not revisionist history or a whitewashing of the Holocaust, this movie may be the most powerful and compelling indictment of Nazism ever made by Hollywood. The question is: Is the story plausible? The answer to that question is yes. Children did live in these concentration camps. Not many, but some, and inmates did interact with people outside. There were literally hundreds of concentration camps located throughout Nazi occupied Europe and given the number of camps and the huge number of people detained, interacting was not only possible, it was inevitable. Maybe the movie stretches matters a bit regarding how the two boys meet, but the idea on which it is based is valid. Should the audience feel any sympathy for the Nazi family? Why not? Maybe not for the husband, the commandant of the camp, who is hardcore Nazi, but certainly for the wife and daughter who clearly are victims too. This movie should be treated for what it is: a work of fiction that deals with certain themes that are universally applicable. These themes include friendship, culpability, loyalty, indeed the whole question of consciousness and morality. The wife's outrage is enough to show that she for one did not accept what was happening in the camps and did what she could to make her feelings known. Yet the most pathetic character is the commandant himself whose destructiveness and brutality is matched only by his stupidity which has tragic consequences and which he realizes to be the case after it's too late.",10,2,3,6 May 2011
The Last Emperor," Puyi: Opportunistic criminal or man caught up in whirlwind of change?
","What is an emperor, who has been told all his life that he is meant to rule, supposed to do when he no longer has an empire? It is easy to condemn the Emperor Puyi as a weak willed collaborator and monarchist and to reasonably wonder why anyone would want to make a movie about such an apparently vacuous person. But Puyi's life was tragic and as such provides the basis for an excellent historical drama. Puyi never asked to be emperor, which was the only job he was ever trained to do, and after having been evicted from his palace ... which was his home ... sought refuge with the Japanese who took him in and gave him a job, the only job he was ever trained to do. So can it be any wonder why the dispossessed emperor would have had some affinity for the Japanese? John Lone gives a great performance as the dispossessed and unhappy emperor and Joan Chen is equally impressive as his depressed and opium addicted wife who was the classic innocent victim and who did nothing to deserve her vile mistreatment by her own people. Mrs. Puyi was so utterly harmless that the mere thought of anyone wanting to mistreat her is sad and troubling. This movie dramatizes a universal theme - the challenges associated with adapting to relentless change as one tries to maintain their emotional equilibrium and sense of identity while all the landmarks of their lives are rapidly disappearing. Was Puyi a opportunistic criminal? Or was he a man caught up in a whirlwind of change that ultimately proved to be his undoing and then his redemption?",10,0,0,3 August 2008
Jerry Maguire," Corny, contrived, shrill.
","This movie is about two guys, both of whom are on the fringes of their respective professions, neither of whom are particularly liked, both of whom who are angry and disillusioned, who transcend their racial differences to form a bond of friendship. This movie strives to achieve greatness, and fails. If it wasn't for Tom Cruise, this movie would have been entirely unwatchable. Just another pretentious movie.Ever watch a movie the first time and like it, then, some time later, watch the same movie a second time, and not like it? Well if that's happened to you, then you will understand where I'm coming from. After watching this movie the first time, I was really impressed with the story and with the acting, and overlooked some major annoyances in the story. But while watching this movie a second time, the annoyances and contrivances were so glaring that they could not be ignored. The relationship between Jerry and his co-worker ... no, his secretary ... no, his girlfriend ... no, his partner ... or whatever, was so awful that it made me cringe in embarrassment; nor was the girlfriend particularly attractive or smart. What was worse was the girlfriend's son, whose role was played by an actor who has to be one of the most bizarre-looking and bizarre-acting child actors ever in the history of Hollywood. This kid made Spanky and Alfalfa seem as normal as apple pie. Then there was Jerry Maguire himself. Who in their right mind would want to have anything to do with a loser like Jerry Maguire? Yet the director apparently wants the audience to believe that Jerry is really a good guy, even after getting punched on the nose and kicked in the stomach by his fiancé, who couldn't take Jerry's erratic behavior anymore. Not exactly the stuff for an entertaining movie. The one character I did like in the this movie, however, was Jerry's one and only client, an angry football player who, unlike Jerry, had reason to be angry and who demands that Jerry get his act together, do his job and show him the money. Yet the relationship between Jerry and his client is so contorted, contrived and improbable that even allowing for literary license, it's hard to buy (get the pun?), even for a movie. After watching this movie for a second time, my advice for any would-be professional athlete is to avoid a Jerry Maguire and represent yourself instead --- you'll get a better deal.",5,14,28,21 September 2005
Jurassic World," A great science fiction movie, a take off on the Frankenstein story. Total mayhem on the screen.
","This movie is about what happens when people dabble in areas of research that are best to be left alone. It is about what happens when military and business interests conspire to engage in projects without any outside controls. It is about what happens when people become smug and complacent to the point of recklessness. It is about what happens when science is perverted for the sake of profit. It is about what happens when caution is tossed into the wind. It is about what happens when nature is violated. It is about what happens when freaks of nature are produced for all the worst reasons. It is about what happens when the scientist loses his moral compass. It is about the arrogance of man. It is about the consequences of unrestrained materialism. This movie contains all the elements of a great science fiction movie. First, it has an excellent and highly inventive story. The idea of dinosaurs working with humans is engaging. Its rationale as explained in the movie is not beyond the realm of plausibility. Second, the special effects are spectacular. The movie contains numerous scenes depicting many different species of dinosaurs, some friendly, some lethal. Third, the dinosaurs are not demonized. Instead, they are portrayed as creatures who are being manipulated. Fourth, the story includes good guys and bad guys. Fifth, the action is nonstop. The principle characters are literally running throughout the movie. Sixth, the script includes many clever and corny lines that evoke laughter. Seventh, the movie dramatizes what happens when safety is sacrificed for profit. The cast is excellent. Vincent D'Onfrio is especially strong as the head of park security who is actually a sell out for the profiteers. But the biggest star are the special effects which in this movie are entirely necessary and in no way gratuitous. For this movie to succeed as a drama, it has to be able to depict the total mayhem and terror caused by the irresponsible conduct of those who sacrificed the public good to make a quick buck. One other point: This movie succeeds in drawing from other great science fiction movies, like Predator, Frankenstein and Jurassic Park to produce an original, unique and powerful dramatic story.",10,74,126,15 June 2015
The Adjustment Bureau," Potentially good movie saved by excellent acting.
","There's a saying: keep it simple. That applies to movies too, especially Hollywood movies. This movie violates that principle, hence the movie stalls. The theme is great. How much free-will do people have? Are the directions of our lives shaped by forces beyond our control? These are deep questions and when Hollywood attempts to answer them, the results could be messy. It's challenging enough to put together a coherent story but when nebulous elements that not fully explained are added to a story, then one of the worst things that can confront the audience occurs: trying to figure out what the movie is about. Matt Damon is as usual excellent as are the rest of the cast, especially John Slattery and Terence Stamp, and their performances save this movie from crossing the line into clunker land, but even their presence cannot undo the damage caused by the story itself. Keep the story simple; entertain the audience.",7,1,2,13 March 2011
World Trade Center," Misses the Mark
","When Hollywood tries to dramatize important and famous historical events, usually the results are mush. This movie is another example of Hollywood mush. 9/11/01 was a day of tragedy. The attack on the United States stunned, shocked, and appalled the American people and indeed people throughout the world. 9/11/01 turned our world upside down and things have never been the same. To accurately capture the feelings of the people on that sad day is a daunting task for the cinematic artist and in trying to achieve this goal this movie misses the mark by a mile. The results simply are flat. The scope of the movie does not capture the overwhelming feeling of collective horror that engulfed the city, the country and the world. 9/11/01 brought the United States literally to a halt. Everything stopped as people, bewildered and stunned, were forced to deal with a tragedy that directly affected every person on this planet. The events of 9/11/01 speak for themselves and require no further dramatization.",5,2,7,22 August 2006
The Hangover Part II," Unfunny, awkward attempt at humor.
","There is probably nothing more dismal in the world of cinema than a comedy that is not funny. The director of this movie tries really hard to generate laughs but without success. This movie proves that goofiness does not necessarily produce laughs. The actors try their best to be funny but their efforts are for naught. Everything about this movie had problems: the poor script, the inane story, the cheesy acting, the transparent attempts to shock the audience, all of which producing a stultifying attempt to get the audience to laugh. Actually, the part of the movie that worked the best was the after the movie ends, with still pics intermixed with the credits. Bradley Cooper is a strong actor but in this movie he is completely miscast. Mr. Cooper simply is not a slap-stick comic. The background of Bangkok, Thailand did nothing to uplift this movie. The seediness and squalor of the city is sad and calls to question whether the Asian continent is as prosperous as reported in the news.",4,5,15,27 May 2011
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Out of control technology.
","What a movie! Another high-tech extravaganza. It required an army of people to produce it. And the result? A highly imaginative science fiction story. The story poses a simple question; What is one to do when artificial intelligence goes berserk and wants to destroy the entire planet? It's similar to the Frankenstein story, except taken to an astronomically higher level. And this monster has infinitely greater destructive power. And whereas the Frankenstein monster had the trappings of being human (although he was not), the creation in this movie is entirely non-organic, making it incredibly more lethal. What makes the story even more fascinating is how it takes an consortium of superheroes to finally bring matters under control. To that point, it is all-out war, with the population of the globe caught in the middle. It is total pandemonium on a worldwide scale. Yet the renegade AI can't be assigned total blame for causing the mayhem. It happened through carelessness, not malicious intent. The AI was already programed; that better care was not taken to prevent what happens is entirely attributable to the human factor.",9,0,3,7 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Not bad, but not great. This is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies.
","Is it finally over? Did the movie finally end? This movie proves the following: NEVER make a movie with comic book characters that is longer than two hours. Even most Shakespearean plays aren't that long. NEVER make a movie that is somber, morose and convoluted. NEVER have the good guy act like a bad guy (here Batman is just as nasty as the guys he's going after). NEVER have the leading lady play a support role. NEVER have lead actors play support roles unless they are no longer leading actors (superstars Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are in support roles). NEVER have Batman without Robin. Christian Bale is no Michael Keaton and Gary Oldman is no Neil Hamilton. This movie needed ... cried out for ... Batwoman (remember Julie Newmar?) ... and Frank Gorshin, Burgess Meredith and Cesar Romero, and, yes, even Burt Ward and Adam West. This pretentious movie is not bad but it certainly is not great. The one bright spot in this otherwise somber production is the performance by the late Heath Ledger. His performance as the Joker almost carries this otherwise lackluster version of the Batman story. Batman is a hero and to portray him as being anything else does not work. Dark Knight is the Doctor Zhivago of Batman movies - long, pretentious, drawn out, somber, and above all, dull.A few words about Heath Ledger. Mr. Ledger was a great actor and proved it in Dark Knight. Despite the movie's flaws, his performance is practically flawless as he brings a unique interpretation of a sinister and complex character to the screen. Whenever Mr. Ledger was in a scene, the movie improved and became interesting. Mr. Ledger gave a great performance for which he deserves a BRAVO!Also, during the filming of Dark Knight, one of the stunt men, Conway Wickcliffe also passed away. Although not a movie star, the loss of Mr. Wickcliffe should be duly noted. From the extra in the crowd to the featured star, every member of the cast and crew play a critical role in bringing a story to the screen ... or the stage. The amount of planning and work involved in producing a movie or staging a play is almost indescribable and without the efforts of EVERY member of the cast and crew, the entertainment brought to public in the movie houses and theaters would not be possible.This movie reportedly is a box office smash hit, but when viewed today the theater was practically empty and after watching this movie, now I know why. After all, if you want to take a nap why pay good money to fall asleep while watching the Dark Knight?",7,8,15,8 August 2008
Friends with Benefits," Tepid story.
","It is a shame that such a wonderfully talented actress as Mila Kunis is so shabbily and tastelessly showcased in such a tepid and empty cinematic product. Hollywood can do better than that! And this is the case after her spectacular performance in The Black Swan. Showing Ms. Kunis prancing around in her undies is really sad. She is a wonderful actress and comedian, not a sex object. And the story itself is pure fluff meant to showcase the male lead, which is really ludicrous. How can Mila Kunis be so grievously miscast? Ms. Kunis is a powerful actress, who has a dominating screen presence, yet she plays second fiddle to the male lead who showcases his body. The story itself is sheer sentimentality covered by a veneer of trash-talking language meant to create an impression of being chic and cool, which is totally out of sinc with the characters themselves who are so shallow that their coolness is a sham. Toward the end of movie Ms. Kunis is finally allowed to display some of her dramatic skills, but it is too little too late as the the damage has been done and the movie comes to a quick and improbable end. The problem with showcasing a male lead in this movie is that the audience is asked to accept the premise that the male actor is more attractive than the female lead and therefore deserves more attention, but in this movie, that definitely does not work. Just like with Pretty Woman, this movie should have showcased the female lead and without making her act like a tramp. Mila Kunis is talented and beautiful; let her be the star.",5,7,16,18 August 2011
Annie Hall," Excellent movie
","This movie is thirty years old but stands the test of time, meaning that after all these years the movie is still watchable. Now why is is still watchable? Because it deals with the nature of relationships, a topic which transcends time. Also, the acting is wonderful, especially Diane Keaton's performance as Annie. Diane Keaton has to be one of the best comediennes Hollywood has ever produced, and Woody Allen goes the extra mile to show the audience the fundamental absurdity and irrationality of romantic involvements. Far from being some corny, superficial farce, this movie presents an interesting character study of a woman who undergoes emotional and intellectual growth while her partner struggles, unsuccessfully, to cope with the change. If you want to watch a movie about someone who changes for the better, then this is the movie for you.",10,1,2,24 June 2007
2001: A Space Odyssey," A qualified success
","Recently I viewed this movie again. Although the story becomes muddled starting with the Jupiter and beyond sequence, nevertheless the movie deserves praise for its special effects and its attempt to delve into the origins of man. And although the story has little action and sparse dialog, it nevertheless succeeds in engaging the audience's attention and maintaining a certain level of suspense, at least for the majority of the film. The problem is that the film ends not with a bang but with a thud. What starts off as being intriguing and at times almost sublime ends in a quagmire of uncertainty as the audience is left wondering what to make of the final scenes. Leaving the audience guessing is not a good way to end a movie and for that reason the movie can be characterized only as a qualified success. When I first saw this movie years ago, I was so intrigued by the music and special effects that I would have rated it a 10. But, alas, time marches on and so does my taste in movies. Recently I happened to watch this movie again and to my chagrin I found it BORING. What made the movie even more unpalatable was the pretentious and muddled story ... or message ... or cryptic allegory ... or whatever, that left me feeling profoundly annoyed. What the heck is this movie about anyway? I liked the beginning with the actors jumping around in monkey suits screaming at each and fighting and, well, acting a lot like people, but when the movie introduced the obelisk ... and then the space station ... and then the talking computer with an attitude ... and then the astronaut growing old ... and then a baby in a capsule looking at earth ... I knew that somewhere there was a message, but it was a message not received by me because frankly, my dear, I didn't give a hoot. The one character in the movie I liked, in fact the only character in the movie that is worthy of the term 'character,' was the computer. If the movie had just been about the computer, and how well he ... or she ... or it ... sang 'Daisy,' I might have liked this movie a lot more. This movie is an example of people getting in the way of a perfectly good story. Let the computer explore space. People have more important things to do.",7,3,8,31 July 2005
Blood Diamond," Good movie
","This is a good movie. The story is compelling and the acting is excellent. The movie suggests that the fighting is instigated by outside forces that want to control access to certain natural resources, a premise which makes for a good movie. The movie raises certain questions. Is all warfare based on the struggle to control natural resources? Is all warfare a response to market forces that demand certain products and will prompt certain groups to take extraordinary measures to ensure that the needs of the market place are met? The analogy to oil and the Mideast crisis is obvious. This movie is a powerful statement on what happens when greed runs rampant. The results are catastrophic.",9,5,8,20 February 2007

And I know that Elaine Robinson is a hapless victim and player in a bizarre and twisted story of marital infidelity and social disillusionment and alienation. Nevertheless, I like this movie. Yes, I'll say it again ... I LIKED THIS MOVIE! The question is: Why? None of the characters in the story, with the exception of Elaine, are particular attractive or nice. In fact, they are some of the most reprehensible characters ever portrayed in a movie. I say this sweeping statement because these characters behave in ways that they know are morally wrong, and despite their knowing better, continue to flaunt themselves anyway. They are angry characters, angry at the world, angry at themselves, angry at each other. They are also boldfaced hypocrites, flaunting their middle-class materialistic trappings, like their nice houses and expensive cars, and so smug, like that fool Mr. Robinson and Ben's father whose only concern is that Ben get a good job and keep up appearances, all of which masking a shallowness and depravity that is the central theme of this story, which is why I liked this movie. The movie offers a candid portrayal of people who you'd think are the salt of the earth and the bedrock of society, but in actuality have the strength and consistency of quicksand. This is a serious movie depicting the moral depravity of modern society and the damage such depravity can cause.",10,1,2,9 November 2005
Elysium," Unconventioanl roles for Foster and Damon.
","This movie was good. It entertained. It told a story. It's just too bad that Jody Foster plays such a negative character. Casting Jody Foster as a heavy just does not work. She simply is not believable as a prissy, power-hungry bureaucrat. Foster has to be the hero, not the villain. She's the wrong person to die, and not get revived. As for Matt Damon, he's out of character too, with mixed results. What this movie needed was a young Sylvester Stallone or a Dolph Lundgren to play Max. Not that Foster and Damon's performances are not good, they are, but they're typed casted already and that's a huge hurdle for them to overcome. In fact, Foster looked wonderful in her business outfit, so neatly did it fit her. Also, William Fichtner performs effectively in a relatively small role as a corrupt robot manufacturer. The story itself is good, although a bit contrived, with the rich people portrayed, of course, as being pampered and self-indulgent, and the poor people a bunch of victims scrounging to survive. The point is made: there is economic injustice and it can drive people to commit acts of desperation. The movie includes imaginative depictions of life on a space station and of space travel as being routine. Whether that will ever happen is a subject for conjecture, but the movie suggests that space flight, at least, low orbit space flight, can be done economically. Anyway, this is a good movie that keeps the audience's attention and is worth watching.",8,0,2,16 August 2013
Avatar," It's hokey ... but it works!
","How does James Cameron do it? How does he manage to take a hokey, transparent story and make it work? It is amazing. Just like with Titanic, Mr. Cameron creates a great movie out of an old story. The movie is great because it grabs and keeps the audience's interest. Also, Mr. Cameron takes CGI to a new level of sophistication, so much so that soon the CGI and the real acting merge as one ... and it works! Having expected this movie to be little more than a long cartoon, surprisingly the movie is a work of cinematic art, and not just an animated feature with voice overs added. The cast is superb, especially Stephen Lang, who plays perhaps the most challenging role, and the always lovely Michelle Rodriguez who gives a strong performance as a soldier with a heart. If this movie proves anything, it is that Michelle Rodriguez is one of the finest actors in Hollywood today, and beautiful too.",10,5,9,29 March 2010
Super 8," The movie has its drawbacks but is watchable.
","The movie has a rocky start but then the story picks up steam. The problem with the movie are the child roles. Not only are they contrived caricatures of pre-adolescents, they are annoying caricatures, especially the one with the hardware in his mouth. Their presence almost destroys the movie. In fact, much of the story is contrived and a rehash of sci-fi formulas that were popular thirty years ago. Nevertheless, the movie does succeed in conveying a sense of suspense as, despite the movie's drawbacks, one wonders how the story will end. The acting is stilted, the dialog is at times ridiculous, the style of the movie pure 1970s, without it intending to be a parity, and the presence of the pre-adolescent caricatures embarrassing. Yet the movie survives to tell a story that is worthy of attention. This movie could have been better but then again it could have been a lot worse, so if it's not a classic at least it's not a joke. However, this movie deserves a rating of 8 out of 10 primarily because of closing credits into which are inserted two popular upbeat songs from the 1970s and an actual 8 mm film clip. It's just too bad that more of the movie was not so innovative.",8,2,3,23 June 2011
Life Is Beautiful," A poignant movie.
","This a beautiful movie. Why? Because it is well acted, well filmed, well written and well done. It's serious without being pretentious. It tells a story. It's about courage, loyalty, caring, and family. Horst Buchholz is wonderful. His performance as the doctor was powerful. What a great actor! Also, the movie avoids becoming an expose on the horrors of the concentration camp and instead manages to stick to the story about the family. Instead of moralizing on the injustices and ill-treatment suffered by the hero, the movie presents a story of sacrifice and spirit which remains strong even in the most dire of circumstances. The movie offers a glimpse of the concentration camp from a little boy's perspective. For the little boy, who is too young to understand the true nature, purpose and implications of the concentration camp, the camp is just a bad place. It's only years later that he truly appreciates what the camp was about and how his father's bravery saved his life.",10,2,4,5 October 2010
Snowden," Snowden - hero or traitor? You decide.
","This movie is proof that when Hollywood wants to, it can make a great movie that grabs the audience's attention and makes you care about what is transpiring in the story. The movie directly poses this question: Is Edward Snowden a hero or a traitor? This movie depicts what he did, explains why he did it, and leaves it to the audience to decide. Although set in a hotel room, this story is anything but static. It deals with issues that are directly relevant to every American and to all people everywhere. This movie is intense and takes the audience on a trip into the inner workings of some of the most secret agencies inside the government. One person does something that actually changed the world. His actions brought to the public's attention a whole bunch of stuff that was going on under wraps and gave them an immediate transparency that was both disturbing and refreshing. One can either resent or admire what Snowden did, but one cannot be indifferent to him, which is why this is such a good movie.",10,3,13,18 September 2016
The Hurricane," A man stuck in an unfeeling bureaucratic machine.
","What a disappointing movie. Who really cares about what happened to Rubin Carter? Who knows whether he was innocent or guilty? The movie suggest that his arrest and conviction was unfair, and maybe it was. But how does that translate into something dramatic? The criminal justice system is not perfect, and miscarriages of justice happen. Now, do these miscarriages of justice make for good drama? The answer is no, because of the highly bureaucratic nature of the criminal justice system which reduces even the most explosive situations down to case files and case numbers, which perhaps is the way it is supposed to be. Mr. Carter's case was initiated, processed, and finalized, and while he was going through the process, many other defendants were going through the same process too. For each defendant the process is dramatic because their life is being affected, but for everyone else, it's just a case. If Mr. Carter was in fact wrongly accused and convicted, then that is a tragedy, but one the depth of which cannot be conveyed in a movie. The injustice is smothered by the sheer weight of the paperwork which highlights the essential indifference of an unfeeling bureaucracy which reduces its subjects to case numbers and treats them accordingly.",7,0,3,12 April 2012
Stalingrad," Band of Brothers, German version, but with some differences.
","Any movie set in World War Two which depicts German soldiers as being just like any other soldiers in the war is at best naïve if not downright ridiculous. This movie is the German version of Band of Brothers and Saving Private Ryan. It is an attempt to depict the war from the German soldier's perspective. The problem is that despite the excellent acting and the harrowing story, the movie fails to generate any empathy or sympathy for the principal characters, all of whom are invaders. They suffer, yet it is suffering that the brought on themselves as representatives of Hitler. This factor cannot be ignored. It's too bad that the these soldiers went through a grinder, but they did it to themselves. Unlike the German soldiers in All Quiet on the Western Front, for whom the futility of their suffering and their alienation generates real sympathy, the German soldiers depicted in this movie do not deserve an iota of respect. That the movie does a great job of depicting the battle from the front line soldier's perspective is commendable, but the movie comes up empty as dramatic story because we already know the ending, and it's not heroic.",8,1,2,2 September 2017
The Fly," One of the great sci-fiction/horror movies -ever.
","This is a great movie. It's a story about tragedy. The story may seem far-fetched, and I guess it is, but it just adds to the intensity of the movie. In addition, Jeff Goldblum, as the main character Seth, gives one of the great performances in the history of sci-fiction movies. As the audience watches Seth slowly but inexorably change into something loathsome and awful, we witness how he fights to maintain his dignity and humanity against all odds, knowing that ultimately he will succumb. This is why this movie is so great. It's not just a mere 'monster' movie. It's a movie about a man who refuses to give up. It's also about his friend who supports him and stays with him till his final moments as a human being.",10,1,3,28 December 2005
Groundhog Day," Excellent movie. Bill Murray's best.
","This movie is easily Bill Murray's greatest work. Ostensibly this movie is a comedy, but it's really a drama with comedic features. The story is uplifting, inspirational and entertaining without becoming mushy. Yes, one can get stuck in life while wallowing in anger that is masked by a veneer of bitter cynicism. The movie's premise is simple yet it's message is profound. How does one deal with the emotional obstacles that distort and inhibit communication? And do you really know the person you're with? Angry people have stories too and sometimes we can read people wrong. Metaphors abound but without the clichés. Life goes on ... or does it? Excellent movie.",Null,0,1,5 December 2007
Total Recall," Rachel Ticotin's greatest movie
","Okay, you may ask yourself: 'Who is Rachel Ticotin and why should I know about her?' The answer: two movies: 'Fort Apache, the Bronx' and this movie. I won't comment here about her role in 'Fort Apache...' but as for this movie, although Arnold Schwarzenneggar and Sharon Stone have top billing, as far as I'm concerned, it is Ms. Ticotin who made 'Total Recall' work. In this movie she is beautiful and heroic and sensitive and loyal. She dominates every scene that she is in and carries the movie. In one scene, she slaps 'Doug' and throws him out, and then in the close-up of her face she reveals all of her anguish knowing that she has spurned the man she loved ... and still loves. The inclusion of such a scene came as a surprise to me. It was a great scene. As for the story itself, it's intriguing and the main characters are either very good or very bad. Nothing new there. But if you're a fan of Rachel Ticotin, then watch this movie.",8,1,2,12 October 2005
Sicario," Bad guys without badges versus bad guys with badges. Muddled story.
","The movie contains huge doses of violence, profanity, tobacco and alcohol use. That's already a bad sign that there's something wrong with the story. Here's the problem: the audience is expected to accept the concept of gangster as hero (played by Benicio del Toro). If you are okay with that premise, then the story makes sense (vendatta - bad guy becoming good guy to go after other bad guys who did him wrong, for whatever reason). If not, then be prepared lots of gratuitous violence and mayhem, as the FBI is co-opted to cover for flagrant and wholesale violations of international law. There is one scene in the movie depicting a fire fight that alone would have sparked a war, or at least a call for an emergency session of the UN Security Council. In fact, including such a scene would have improved this movie immensely. The thing is, unless the movie is meant to be a morality tale, there has to be a clear delineation between the good guys and bad guys. That this movie lacks, thus making the story pointless. This movie depicts US paramilitary forces conducting military operations in a foreign country to deal with a criminal problem. True, the story is fiction. The problem is that as the line between who is good and who is bad gets blurred, the story get muddled. After a while, it is difficult to tell the difference between the good guys and bad guys. Granted that the drug cartel guys are bad guys. But when compared to the brazen tactics being used by the other side, it raises doubts as to who is posing more of a threat to the public safety - the the gangsters or the guys with the badges. What good are having bad guys if the good guys are no good too? Without revealing details of story, suffice it to say that if the shenanigans depicted in this movie occurred for real, the US government would have a lot of explaining to do",3,8,19,13 October 2015
Pretty Woman," Can a prostitute fall in love?
","This movie is not about prostitution. Rather it's about a prostitute who actually grows as a person. That's plausible. It can happen. In this movie it does happen. And that is the rub. The movie is on thin ice here because the audience has to accept the premise that a prostitute can actually learn to care about her john, which is asking a lot from the audience. If the audience does not buy into the character Vivian, then the whole movie becomes unwatchable. However, Julia Roberts does such a great job as Vivian that the movie works. She was the right choice for the role; she makes the character believable. Another actress may have played the role differently with different, less satisfying results.Can a prostitute fall in love? In this movie it happens. What's the problem with that? Street hookers are people too and in this movie the street hooker changes. She wants and demands money; acts out; angles for that extra buck, but eases up when she realizes that the john who is willing to pay top dollar is also a good guy who is willing to treat her like a person, not an object. This scenario is entirely plausible. Total strangers meet under the most improbable circumstances and fall in love. This formula is classic Hollywood and in this movie the actors make it work. The man treats the woman decently and she responds. That makes for a good story. The audience wants the relationship to work. This is a wonderful, upbeat movie, about two people who actually learn to care about each other. The man is a rich, cynical business man; the woman is a prostitute. What starts out as a business proposition evolves into something special, as the two characters evolve and reveal aspects of themselves that are endearing and engaging. At the start of the movie, both characters have contempt for the opposite sex. The man is in the middle of getting a divorce; for the woman, men are mere customers, nothing more. But when they meet, the chemistry is instantaneous. These two people transcend their personal biases to let down their defenses and learn to sincerely care for each other, which changes their behavior and enhances their self-esteem, thereby making them better people. For this reason this movie is worth watching.Recently I had the opportunity to watch this movie again on a cable network. What a great movie! Talk about opportunity knocking! Ms. Julia Roberts was something like the fourth or fifth actress to be considered for the title role, and she is great in that role. The role was meant for her. She is the center of the movie. Ms. Roberts' performance is magnificent. She is THE star. Richard Gere is good, but Julia Roberts is the one who makes this movie great. Three cheers for Julia Roberts and three cheers for this classic movie.",10,1,3,8 August 2005
Pretty Woman," Perhaps the best love story in the history of cinema
","Watched this movie again, for maybe the tenth time since it was first released in 1990, and it is still as fresh as ever. An angry business man who uses his money to destroy businesses, and the in the process hurt people, meets a street hooker, a real slut, and they fall in love. Alone, both are struggling to survive; together they form a bond that nothing can break. On the surface the story seems farfetched, even contrived. A rich guy hooking up with a slutty whore - no way. However, this why this movie is so great. The story is not only believable, but appealing. Despite the huge difference in their social statuses - Edward is loaded with money and spends it, while Vivian is struggling just to pay the rent - both characters have one thing in common - intelligence. In each one's respective circles, they are surrounded by people who are not only vile but stupid. The movie captures how Edward and Vivian immediately connect. It is the key scene in the movie and shapes the entire story. Botch that scene and the whole story collapses. The cast brings this story to life. Richard Gere and Julia Roberts deliver the best performances of their careers. Gere is somber and tense and Roberts is sassy yet a little menacing. Their chemistry is impossible to miss. They become the characters they are playing. The movie depicts the story in a straightforward manner. The movie shows how Edward and Vivian evolve, in the process bringing out aspects of themselves that were lying suppressed. Alone, they were fighting the world; together, the world is theirs. Tremendous story about the power of love.",10,1,4,31 July 2018
The Descent," This movie is a dud.
","As a moviegoer, I go to movies that I expect may be bad. In this respect, The Descent does not disappoint. The movie met all my expectations. Ridiculous story, gratuitous violence, artistically tasteless, and poorly acted. Whoever made this movie apparently decided that they will jettison all intellectual content and replace it with ... nothing. Since the movie is so utterly lacking in intellectual content, there is little that one can say about it. Indeed, this movie defies serious discussion and offers nothing that is worthy of serious consideration. But the bottom line is that the movie is not entertaining. This movie is a dud.",1,11,21,1 September 2006
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise delivers.
","Tom Cruise as an action hero works. The movie contains all the elements for a good action crime movie. Tom Cruise is the star (it's also his movie). He does it all, and does it well. The story is intriguing although a bit contrived and after a while Tom Cruise's anti-hero persona begins to become over baked, but not to the point where it has to be tossed from the oven. The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Rosamund Pike who plays the principal female lead. Now, the idea of framing a patsy to a crime is hardly an original one, but this movie manages to apply this formula with good results. There is one chase scene that is especially entertaining. Everybody is chasing everybody, like something out a Keystone Kops movie. But Tom Cruise turns in an energetic performance which keeps the movie together. Robert Duvall is also in this movie and his performance is, not unexpectedly, excellent. He is a great actor. There's a lot of impressive panoramic shots of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the story is set. Although it's not an earth-shattering major motion picture, the movie entertains and that alone is reason enough to watch it.",8,5,12,2 January 2013
The Da Vinci Code," It's a turkey.
","Let me get right to the point. This movie is pretentious, poorly acted, and attempts to convey a muddled message on a complicated subject that is meant for serious scholarly consideration and not to be grist for another half-baked Hollywood potboiler. The movie attempts to use a theological controversy as the basis for a convoluted 'who-done-it' story and in the process makes assertions that even for a work of fiction demands credible evidence. Now the producers of this movie have the absolute right to make a movie with a theological content, but along with that right comes the responsibility of providing hard evidence to back up the movie's fantastic and completely speculative assertions. Further, the characters in this movie are so utterly superficial, uninspiring, uninteresting and comic-bookish that it seemed that even the actors themselves knew that this movie is one big turkey. Indeed, this could be the worst movie in Tom Hanks's otherwise brilliant career. Indeed, perhaps the main character of the movie should have been Inspector Clouseau.",2,0,4,6 June 2006
Titanic," Even though the ship sank, it's still a very good movie
","Titanic is Hollywood's biggest moneymaker in history and for good reason - it is a great movie. This movie is about sacrifice, selflessness, love, devotion, joy, passion, all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks, resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history. Kate Winslett is magnificent as the young girl, Rose, barely a teenager, who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry Cal, a nasty, brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fiancé. That Cal is rich just makes his behavior worse. Rose, by nature a gentle spirit, is angry and desperate to escape, so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man, Jack, who, despite his shabby appearance, is a well-traveled, sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds. Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other. This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior. Rose willingly gives herself to Jack out of love for him, and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love, the man who died for her so she could live. That is love. That is sacrifice. That is life. That is Christian. That they were not formally married is a mere technicality. Given the circumstances of their meeting. a loving and understanding G-d will forgive them. Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose, instead of cashing it in like she could have, she kept it as a memento to her one true love. That is called character. Nothing unchristian about that. Indeed, the movie is actually about how Rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive, unhappy, moody adolescent into a composed, mature, independent and beautiful woman, even changing her name, now prepared to go on to live a long and active life. That is, she experiences an epiphany. That is called personal growth which is quite Christian and most exemplary. As for Jack, he is with Rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly, knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived. Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live. That is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with Christian teachings.Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I will: I was waiting for the ship to sink because I was hoping that when the ship sank the movie would end ... but it didn't, and for that I was disappointed. To me, the story of the the Titanic is what happened to the ship, not some contrived, fictional, and highly improbable love story between a Little Miss Rich Girl and a Mr. Nice Guy Ne'er Do Well. The movie is weak for two reasons: First, the movie is asking me to believe that a young lady would dump her handsome, powerful, influential and above-all wealthy fiancé who has her mother's approval in favor of a no-account nobody who didn't even belong on the ship. Second, since we already know what's going to happen to the ship, much of the excitement is lost. Nevertheless, the portrayal of how the ship actually sank, and the resulting pandemonium, was effectively done. So if the movie had gotten rid of the love story and concentrated instead on how the passengers and crew coped with the impending sinking of the ship, that could have been the basis for an exceedingly dramatic story. But Hollywood being Hollywood, if the story doesn't include at least a smidgen of sex and a big dose of sentimentality, no matter how contrived, then that story won't be the one that makes it onto the screen, and this movie is proof of that statement. As further proof of that statement consider the final scene in which Little Miss Rich Girl, who's now something like 100 years old and a great-grandmother, tosses a multimillion-dollar diamond overboard in the name of love. Even for a movie that's unbelievable. It would have been better if she had used the diamond to pay for a salvaging operation to recover the divan on which she had posed nude for her boyfriend, Mr. Nobody, who, by sheer coincidence, also happened to be an accomplished artist. (Duh!) Now THAT would have made for a good story. The movie could have been entitled: 'The Titanic - The Story of a Woman and the Divan that Made Her Famous.' Now if somebody out there would like to advance me 50 or 100 million dollars to make this movie, then we'll be in business.",8,2,4,31 July 2005
Rocky III," Mr. T is Wonderful
","Rocky III would be a long-forgotten movie if it wasn't for one special character, Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T. Mr. T was the dynamo that charged up this movie and kept it from becoming just another grade B sleeper. Because by Rocky III, Rocky Balboa is already washed up and ready to retire. And who wants to watch a movie about a washed up boxer who is ready to retire? But Mr. T energizes this movie, giving it resuscitation needed so that it can live and say something besides that Rocky's time is over and done with, that Mickey should go home and that Pauly should go back to the meat packing plant. Once Mr.T gets involved, the fireworks go off because it's just a matter of time before he and Stallone have it out, which saves the movie from total oblivion. In this movie Clubber Lang is The Man and he's the character that makes this movie work.",7,1,2,27 July 2005
Zombieland," Surprisingly good movie.
","As much as I expected this movie to be pure junk, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it is actually a good movie. This movie presents an offbeat story that is part science-fiction, part action and all comedy. Woody Harrelson gives a strong and amusing performance as a quirky character who is both a hero and buffoon and clearly dominates the story. The movie has lots of action, good continuity, and, unlike most Hollywood products today, is not overly long. The director wastes no footage as he put together what has to be one of the best edited movies maybe in decades. Gone are all the extraneous and superfluous filler that ruins most movies. Here the story is taut, simple, watchable and entertaining. The zombies are reduced to mere animated objects who can be abused and eliminated without a second thought and here lies the rub. For the ghouls that lay in wait for unsuspecting humans were once human themselves and what happened to them was not their fault but the result of something much larger and more profound. Yet the movie skirts the tragic dimensions of the catastrophe that has befallen the world and instead reduces the disaster to the level of a goofy comedy ... and it works. As long as the movie is accepted for what is is, parody, then it is entertaining. But if you are expecting a hand wringing moralistic tale of epic proportions then you may be disappointed, even while you laugh.",8,2,4,12 October 2009
Enemy at the Gates," A Potentially Great Movie Rendered Mediocre
","Stalingrad. The largest single battle in recorded history, or maybe in the history of the universe. Two huge armies fighting over control of a huge industrial city with factory complexes one-mile long located in one of the most inaccessible parts of western Russia. The outcome of World War Two hinges on the outcome of this stupendous battle. The battle itself should have been more than sufficient to render this movie great, or at least nearly great. But, alas, that does not happen. Instead, this movie attempts to give us an 'up close and personal' account of the battle of Stalingrad in the form of some kind of contest between one German soldier and one Russian soldier to prove who's the best sniper. Well, who cares? At least a million soldiers and civilians died in this battle, so what's the fuss about two individual soldiers? The beginning of the movie is most compelling, but when the story evolves, or devolves, into some kind of personal struggle, then, if you take this movie at face value, maybe the Battle of Stalingrad was nothing but a big soap opera, the outcome of which just happened to change the course of history. Oh, by the way, there's also a love scene in this movie. (Imagine having a love scene in Guadalcanal Diary.)",5,1,2,30 July 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Angelina Jolie for Comic Actress of the Year!
","Mr. and Mrs. Smith are just an ordinary couple, living in an ordinary town and in an ordinary house and leading ordinary lives. Or so the audience is lead to believe. But the audience knows better, or at least they should know better. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are not paid big bucks to play just anybody, and the movie soon proves this to be the case. Once Pitts's and Jolie's covers are blown, sparks fly, things blow up, and the one-liners spew forth at a rate almost equal to that of the speed of sound. What this movie proves is that Angelina Jolie is now the funniest comic actress since Sandra Bullock. In fact, if someone decided to make an updated version of 'I Love Lucy,' I would definitely cast Ms. Jolie in the role of Lucy Ricardo. There is no question that she would do credit to such a role. Andy Garcia could play Ricky Ricardo, and Dom De Louise and Cathy Bates could play Fred and Ethel Mertz. But enough of this digressing. 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' is good entertainment, and Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt work well together, and for these reasons alone the movie is worth watching.",7,1,4,31 July 2005
The Departed," 'Beware of the Hype.'
","'Beware of the hype, for it shall mislead.' 'There is a direct relationship between the level of hype and a movie's mediocrity.' These are axioms that are as immutable as Isaac Newton's Law of Gravity or the speed of light and the truth of which are again evident in this dismal movie. Judging by the hype that preceded this movie, I am neither surprised nor disappointed by this movie's utter lack of quality. This movie is so bad that the scenes of graphic and gratuitous violence provoked unintended laughter. (By the way, isn't there enough violence already in the world that Hollywood has to dramatize it? Can't Hollywood ease off on the violence? Why show people being gunned down? How does that make the world a better place? How does that add to the artistic quality of a movie?) Also, the story itself and characters involved are so utterly insipid and so lacking in anything that even remotely resembles originality that they cannot be taken seriously. A police officer on the take? A criminal who is also an informant? The main characters in this movie are gangsters and corrupt police officers. It's understood that they are violent. So why show the violence? Remember the hype and judge accordingly.",3,4,6,16 November 2006
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Pull the plug on this pathetic, pretentious hunk of junk.
","This movie is so awful, so devoid of anything that even remotely resembles a work of art that one can reasonably conclude that the director was instructed to sacrifice any vestige of artistic quality in order to make a quick buck. There can be no other credible explanation for why this weird cartoon/live action concoction was made in the first place. The producers of this movie must have gotten together and decided that they will make a movie suitable for a four-year-old but advertise it as a PG-13 movie and thus sucker in adults to watch this incredible cinematic mess. In fact, this film is so bad that no child should be made to have to watch this cacophony of noise. There are enough problems in this world that we do not need to add a movie that shows machines behaving like people and so-on-and-so-forth. Sometimes a movie is bad because of poor directing, sometimes because of poor acting, sometimes because of a poor script, sometimes because of poor cinematography and sometimes because of other creative factor. This movie combines the worst features of all the categories mentioned. This movie, which is part cartoon and part live action, seems determined to delete or play down anything that even remotely resembles a coherent and intellectually stimulating plot. The fundamentally infantile plot is overshadowed only by the gratuitous use of special effects that are so cartoon-like that it makes one wonder why this movie even bothered to use actors at all. But what ultimately destroys this movie as a quality work of art is a ponderous, pedestrian, witless and implausible plot that asks the audience to root for or at least care about machines, big, noisy, ugly, clanking, machines, which is definitely stretching literary license to the limit. A machine is ... a machine and to invest it with human qualities is an untenable concept that is bound to destroy the plausibility of any story and this movie is no exception. This would be like having the USS Enterprise become one of the characters in Star Trek or a tank or aircraft carrier having something to say in a war movie. But that is what this movie asks the audience to accept, and it does not work because it cannot work. Machines fighting ... settling grudges ... discussing issues of good vs. bad ... ugh! Now, the movie does make an intriguing attempt to mimic the opening scenes from 2001 A Space Odyssey, but quickly slides back to a level of intellectual sophistication appropriate for a child - a very young, preliterate child. It is as if the director had no confidence in the screenwriter or lost confidence in the power of cinema to actually tell a literate story, and instead opted to fill the movie with ridiculous special effects a la the recent remake of King Kong with its plethora of incredibly hysterical special effects that reduced THAT movie to the level of a cinematic joke. Indeed, this movie might have worked better if King Kong HAD made a cameo appearance and duked it out with one of the bad guy machines. King Kong vs. The Machines. But that's another story. This movie is so devoid of intellectual content that it makes one of Michael Bay's other movies, Pearl Harbor, seem like a first-class production of Shakespeare. Enough already. Just pull the plug on this noisy, pretentious, ludicrous, inane, boring, and decidedly obtuse clunker. Or better yet, just take it out of circulation and stick it in the junk yard with all the other rusting and worthless pieces of junk.",1,18,50,26 June 2009
Jersey Boys," Good movie; entertaining.
","This movie is not great but it is certainly good. As a discography of the work of the Four Seasons, the movie is fabulous. But as a biopic about four guys from New Jersey, the movie comes close to hitting the target but somehow misses the mark. Unlike the music, which is substantive, the portrayals of the musicians themselves at times come off as corny and contrived, with lots of cheesy acting, which is too bad for the movie since their personal stories seem actually quite interesting. Although they had personal issues, the Four Seasons were first and foremost creative artists who developed a style of music that the public liked. However, instead of going with the upbeat music, the movie plays up the bickering and quarreling within the group, which seems petty and undramatic when compared to the success they achieved as musicians. The story of the Four Seasons is their music, thus, for that reason alone the movie is worth watching.",8,2,5,9 July 2014
The Holiday," An entertaining Cameron Diaz vehicle.
","When watching this movie one can only be impressed with Cameron Diaz. This is her movie; her wonderful performance makes this movie work. Although the story is mostly Hollywood fluff and is about as substantive as a cloud in the sky, Ms. Diaz brings life to what would otherwise be a implausible facsimile of an actual story. The always beautiful Kate Winslet is wonderful too but in this movie she definitely plays second fiddle to Ms. Diaz's lead. As for the story itself, it has so many holes in it that there is not enough room to discuss them all. Suffice it to say, this movie is character, not story, driven. The male leads, Jude Law and Jack Black, are to be commended for subordinating themselves to the ladies; after all, this is a movie about two women who do something daring and in the process change their lives. But regardless of what one may think of the story, Cameron Diaz's presence will, for you, make watching this movie an entertaining experience.",7,0,1,9 May 2010
Zero Dark Thirty," It's a 21st-century war movie.
","This movie is outstanding. The acting is strong, the story is compelling, the dialog incisive and the cinematography impressive. The movie does not play politics. Rather it tells a tremendously dramatic story about courage, fortitude and determination. The story has a beginning, a middle and an end, and although the audience knows the final outcome, that does not affect or reduce the movie's dramatic impact. The source of the drama is not the actual tracking down of Osama bin Laden but the interactions within the intelligence community that was under a lot of pressure to find targets, relying on uncertain information obtained by questionable means in a hostile environment. The movie graphically depicts frustrated American operatives frantically using torture to obtain information from detainees regarding bin Laden's whereabouts with limited results. The movie also depicts American operatives flagrantly violating Pakistani airspace to attack bin Laden. Whether these actions were proper is left to the audience to decide; the movie does not take sides. But what the movie does convey is the fact that the United States is fighting a war that is unlike any war previously fought, with an enemy that is elusive and transnational, and that tactics requiring speed and stealth can produce positive results, provided there is accurate intelligence.",10,5,14,14 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Steve Jobs as a grouch? Muddled story. Strong performance by Michael Fsssbender
","A man has an idea: everyone on the planet can have his or her own personal computer or PC. The PC would be totally interactive and could be taken anywhere; it would be ascetically attractive and be both a toy and and decorative object. Yes, a great idea. In this movie, this man's idea gets buried inside a mountain of techno-babble and interminable griping that obscures the story to the point that it loses its cohesiveness. The story starts in the middle of something and ends in the middle of something. The man withe the idea is, of course, Steve Jobs. He is portrayed by Michael Fassbender whose physical similarity to Jobs is uncanny. His performance is powerful and dominates the movie. Unfortunately the same adjective, powerful, cannot be applied to the movie itself. More apt would be the adjectives choppy and confusing. If one is not already familiar with the story of Steve Jobs, this movie will make no sense. Just a story of two guys at odds with each other over whose should get credit for a computer. That does raise an interesting question: who's more important - the creator of a product or the person who sells it? This leads to another question: Who cares? In this movie Steve Jobs is depicted as supercilious, pushy, arrogant, argumentative and self-centered. Not exactly the most attractive qualities to show on the screen. Who wants to watch a movie about a grouchy guy? To balance this, the movie includes a stock character, the faithful assistant, played by Kate Winslet as Ms Hoffman. But even she has her run-ins with the moody Jobs. He gets along with no one. This raises yet another question: if Jobs is so prissy and nasty, then how is it that he managed to be such a huge success in an industry that required the ability to mobilize highly educated and intellectually gifted people and gain their cooperation? Jobs must have been doing something right.",5,3,9,27 October 2015
Crazy Heart," High quality cinematic experience.
","Hollywood is full of surprises. Just when you're ready to throw in the towel and groan in despair that EVERYTHING Hollywood produces is trite garbage, along comes a movie like this one that not only is well acted but actually has a comprehensible and respectable story. Jeff Bridges gives a strong and masterful performance as a broken down singer whose life is in shambles. He succeeds in engaging and keeping the audience's attention and brings a complex and troubled character to life. It is a performance worthy of special recognition. The rest of the cast is also excellent, especially Maggie Gyllenhaal whose presence adds immeasurably to the movie's watchability. The chemistry between Jeff and Maggie is intense and remains so throughout the movie as the audience watches their cinematic relationship evolve. What makes this movie especially effective is that it avoids becoming just another piece of corny hokum and stays on course as the characters work through their situations. Plausibility and creativity are at work resulting in a high quality cinematic experience.",10,2,6,2 February 2010
War of the Worlds," Good remake of a classic story
","This is a very good movie. The special effects were excellent. But more importantly the movie was well acted, especially by Tom Cruise and Tim Robbins who were both excellent, and presented a story which conveyed two seemingly simple yet sublime messages: complacence can lead to disaster and that even the most minute living creatures have a purpose. In this movie Tom Cruise demonstrated a range of emotions that added immeasurably to the entertainment value of this movie. For this movie is more than just a mere sci-fi thriller with a lot of glossy special effects. Rather, it is a portrayal of people reacting to a sudden and unexpected catastrophe. The parallel to 9-11 is apparent. And although some of the scenes in the movie contain moments of Hollywood hokeyness, such as the scenes with the little girl who plays Tom Cruise's daughter, the main theme, that of people trying to survive in the midst of overwhelming crisis, remains intact, which prevents the movie from becoming a mere special-effects spectacle. The depictions of violence are graphic and convey the intensity of the dilemma confronting humanity. The invaders mean business and with their machines are intent on inflicting an immediate and lethal reign of terror meant to destroy all humanity. If you like a well-acted science fiction movie that tells a compelling story, then this is the movie for you.",9,1,4,25 July 2005
12 Years a Slave," A candid depiction of a depraved institution.
","This movie provides a candid and dramatically powerful depiction of the institution of slavery in the United States. This movie touches on and in some ways dives into the many different themes associated with the institution. First, the movie shows how it corrupted everyone involved in it. No matter what their involvement, the institution brought everyone down. Second, the movie dramatizes the political consequences of slavery, how slavery exacerbated sectional conflicts and distorted political discourse. Third, the movie dramatizes the deleterious psychological effects of slavery. Unwilling to come to honestly come to terms with the nature of the institution, the movie shows how slave owner rationalized their own conduct toward the slaves, with devastatingly tragic consequences. Fourth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the United States to follow its own creed of liberty and justice by showing how free blacks were denied the full protection of the law. Fifth, this movie dramatizes the essential barbarism and degeneracy of slavery in the way it brought out and validated the worst in people. Sixth, the movie shows how slavery was a form of state-sponsored vigilantism in the way an entire class of people were subject to the full weight of the state with absolutely no protection. Seventh, the movie pulls no punches in showing the brutality of the institution, e.g., graphic depictions of beatings, whippings, fighting, psychological torture, humiliation, dehumanization, inadequate food, clothing, shelter, and terrorism - all happening under the color of law. Eighth, movie dramatized how by 1841 there was those who already realized that the United States was heading toward a civil war. Ninth, the movie shows how economic self-interest drove slavery, that slavery was profitable. Tenth, the movie dramatizes the failure of the religious community to take action to end slavery and instead used scripture to justify slavery's existence. This movie features many excellent performances, most notably by Michael Fassbinder and Brad Pitt, the latter giving one of his better performances. As for Fassbinder, his performance warrants an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. His portrayal of the angry, troubled, vicious slave owner who is deteriorating physically, mentally and spiritually carries this movie. This movie is worth watching. Don't expect an upbeat story, because it isn't. But do expect a powerful dramatic treatment of an unpleasant yet historically important subject.",10,9,16,4 November 2013
There Will Be Blood," Daniel Day Lewis give a strong performance in an otherwise completely implausible movie.
","When you talk about pretentious, this movie is it. Mister Day-Lewis is fine as the lead character and the actors are excellent too, but it's the story that brings this movie down. What a contrived, melodramatic bunch of gump. Here's an angry man beating up on the earth, and the audience is supposed to believe that anybody would do business with him? Even a Hollywood movie requires a certain amount of plausibility. This man is so angry and maladjusted that it is hard to imagine how he could get it together to do business and make money. This fellow does everything he can to intimidate and drive people away yet the movie is about him interacting with people. How could anyone be expected to take this character seriously? He yells at people, is violent and at times is completely obnoxious. Okay, if this what the audience likes, so be it. But the next time you come across a businessman with a scowl on his face, ask yourself: Is this guy about to blow up on me, like that guy does in that oil movie? I give this movie a 7 only because of DDL's strong performance.",7,0,2,30 August 2010
Burlesque," Hollywood musical with lots of kick.
","Cher is great in this movie. She should be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. And the movie itself is wonderful. It's far-fetched, brassy, silly, wonderful. The musical numbers are incredible. Christine Aguilera is charming and wow, can she sing! Even the bad guy is wonderful. This is the type of movie that makes you feel like you don't want it to end. It offers nonstop music, melodramatics, silly scenes, and laughs. Stanley Tucci is great as Cher's assistant, friend, and confidante. Burlesque is larger than life, it's pure escapism. The musical numbers fill the screen, the music is loud, snappy and upbeat. The movie has no lulls, is entertaining, has a simple storyline and likable characters. If anyone thinks that Cher is over the hill, watch this movie and think again, And if anyone thinks that Ms. Aguilera is not star material, watch this movie and think again. This movie is proof that the Hollywood musical is still alive and kicking.",9,13,23,25 November 2010
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A tragic story about men who die for nothing.
","The movie withstands the test of time, meaning that the story still resonates, decades after the movie's initial release. It depicts prisoners of war and deals with ethical issues that transcends time. A British commander deludes himself into believing that he is doing something good when in fact he is a shameless collaborationist who is selling out his country to satisfy his own vanity. Every member of the cast deliver excellent performances. That is especially true of Jack Hawkins and William Holden. Alec Guinness plays the Colonel. His performance is singularly impressive and iconic. He sets the standard for the depiction of the pompous and arrogant military officer type. The problem with the movie is its ending. It is too abrupt and given the Colonel's intense and deep emotional investment in the bridge, there is no way that he would suddenly realize the reprehensible nature of his actions. He is too deluded. But the movie redeems him, raising him to the level of a tragic figure, the good man who goes astray. The question is: was he really a good man?Additional comments after having watched the movie again. The movie's final scene is harrowing. All the principal characters die over a bridge that had become the focal point of a power struggle between two men who hated each other yet were forced to work together. The bridge was built not out of love but out of hate. In doing so, both protagonists bring dishonor to themselves. Nicholson becomes a collaborationist while Saito forfeits his authority. When Nicholson finally realizes the folly of what he had done, it is too late. The bridge is gone along with the men who died for nothing.",10,0,2,16 June 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," Time looping is not fun.
","Time travel and time loops, two literary contrivances that must be applied with care. In this movie, these contrivances work. It works because of the principal character, Major Cage, played by Tom Cruise. With each loop, more and more information is revealed about Major Cage, who is the subject of the movie. It is an interesting way of telling a story. When the looping stops, no more is learned about Cage and the movie ends, rather predictably, and a predictable ending never helps a movie. The mixture of science fiction and suspense adds to the story, as one wonders what will finally happen to Major Cage. He's a reluctant hero and is caught up in war and in a time travel infundibulum that is reminiscent of Billy Pilgrim's travels in Slaughter House Five and Phil Connors' in Groundhog Day, but without sentimentality or corniness. Yet, one can care about Cage as he struggles to make sense out of what initially is a confusing situation. Tom Cruise succeeds in playing his role well and in carrying the movie.",8,1,3,16 July 2014
Downfall," Great movie.
","This movie probably provides the best dramatic treatment of Adolf Hitler. Unlike other movies that tend to present Hitler as a caricature, this movie opts to portray Hitler as a historical person and not as a clown. Although it is easy to reduce Hitler to a subject for mockery, this movie avoids that temptation and instead presents an Adolf Hitler the person whose actions are made even more sinister, baffling and amazing by the sheer banality of his existence. In this movie Hitler is shown not as a hysteric, not as the bombastic political actor, leader and rabble rouser familiar in all too many documentaries, but as a frail, broken, disillusioned man whose dreams have been shattered and whose closest advisers have all but abandoned him. Yet, even as Hitler himself realizes that his demise is all but inevitable, the movie shows how the cohort of secretaries, clerks and party flunkies who formed Hitler's personal staff refused to leave him and opted to stay with the Fuhrer to the bitter end. This level of devotion to a failed and doomed head of state is perhaps unprecedented in history. While the Third Reich was crumbling they stayed with the man who was responsible for the destruction of their country. Yet the same man who was capable of ordering the conquest of entire countries and the extermination of entire peoples was also capable of individual acts of kindness that makes his career all the more baffling to the audience. Can the personality and career of Adolf Hitler ever be fully explained? Maybe not, but this excellent movie at least provides a plausible glimpse of what Hitler may have been about and how his dreams of new world order came crashing down.Also, special mention must be made of Bruno Ganz's uncanny resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Mr. Ganz gives what has to be the most outstanding cinematic portrayal of Adolf Hitlee. Mr. Ganz succeeds in portraying Hitler as a caricature and instead provides a credible and even-handed portrayal of a person whose actions have been the cause for the kind of scorn and mockery that obscures who Hitler was as a man.",10,8,11,30 March 2008
Whiplash," The pathway to perfection is not an easy road to travel.
","There are many reasons to dislike this movie. It shows a teenager being psychologically and physically abused. It shows art being portrayed as something painful. It shows someone abusing his authority. It shows the collapse of a romantic relationship, causing deeply hurt feelings. The story in general comes off as being contrived. Yet, this movie is great. It is highly entertaining, the reason being its theme: what is an artist supposed to do to satisfy his quest for perfection? In this case, the metaphor for perfection is Buddy Rich, who was a famous American jazz drummer. In this movie, Rich's work is used as a standard for artistic perfection, in this case, artistic expression through the playing of percussion instruments. The structure of the plot is simple: a music teacher, Fletcher, wants to bring out the brilliance of his student, Andrew. He believes that the best way to accomplish this through humiliation which will test the level of the student's commitment to achieving greatness and perfection. The student becomes the tool through which the teacher can vicariously achieve perfection. For this story is about the teacher. He is the principal character, the one around whom the action takes place. The teacher is a metaphor for all the artists in the world who are striving for something that they themselves cannot achieve, and so seek it out in others. To bring it out is the challenge, and that generates conflict, as the teacher must first break down the student's resistance, which is a painful and risky process. Painful because it involves elements of abuse; risky because he may lose the student. The acting is superb. J. K. Simmons's gives a terrifically powerful performance as the teacher, Fletcher, and Miles Teller gives a tremendous performance as the student, Andrew. The story moves at a brisk pace and achieves moments of extreme intensity that alone make the movie worth watching. True, the movie includes brief but graphic scenes of physical violence perpetrated against a teenager, but this takes place within the context of an extremely emotional and volatile relationship which drives the story, and without which the story may lose some of it strength.",10,4,8,25 February 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," A cinematic free-for-all with Mr. Di Caprio leading the way.
","What a wacky, goofy movie! This movie is a spoof on all the props that drive the United States on - capitalism, banks, stock brokers, family, friendship, religion. Nothing escapes the mockery of the director. It is as if the director was given a carte blanche to have his way and have his say with no holds barred. And in this movie, no holds are barred. It is a cinematic free-for-all, with Leonardo Di Caprio, in his greatest role, leading the pack. Di Caprio not only makes this movie happen, he IS the movie. His presence is so dominating that it is impossible to separate him from the movie and still have a movie. This is a case where the movie is both story driven and actor driven. True, the other members of the cast are wonderfully entertaining too, but they are support characters for the one star of the movie. Now, why is this movie so entertaining? Because it calls to attention and unmasks the phoniness of a system that purports to be the envy and role model for the world. It says to the audience, 'Behold, I am unclothed! Take me for what I am!' Yet, the movie is not all goof; it also contains some disturbing scenes of a domestic nature which underscore the precarious and potentially violent nature of relationships. If one likes movies that take off the gloves and say it like it is, this the movie for you. If you don't like those kinds of movies, then watch it anyway; it may change your mind.",10,3,12,14 January 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Idi Amin - - Wanton murderer or misunderstood nationalist?
","Who was the real Idi Amin? Was he a wanton murderer as history suggests? Was he a misunderstood nationalist who believed he was acting on behalf of his country? Was he really a 'nice guy' who had to do nasty things? This movie offers an up close and personal portrayal of Idi Amin the man. In this movie Amin laughs, speaks with candor, is charming, and is supported by the people. But Amin is also capable of committing cruel acts of brutality against those who he believes are his enemies and will turn against his closest advisers if he detects even the slightest hint of disloyalty. For what Amin demands and expects most of all is unquestioning loyalty and in return he offers genuine friendship. Forrest Whitaker's performance as Idi Amin is phenomenal. His resemblance to the actual Idi Amin is uncanny. This movie is worth watching.",9,1,2,25 January 2007
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A slow, ponderous piece of celluloid.
","Zzzzzz ... zzzzzzz ... zzzzzzz ....... oh, the movie's still on (yawn) ... zzzzzzz ... zzzzzzz ....... Oh, the movie's still on. I'm going back to sleep (yawn) .... What an incredibly slow and boring movie. Interminable talking. The movie attempts to take the Dracula story in a new direction and gets lost on the way. A simple, straightforward story is made into a convoluted, complex melodrama. After Bela Lugosi, who else can really play Dracula? Gary Oldman gives a good performance of Dracula ... in slow motion. It's not his fault, it's the material he has to work with. Dracula is an overpowering force but in this movie he is a more introspective, almost human character, still powerful, still menacing, but somehow in this movie not nearly as shocking as previous versions of the movie. The movie does have its moments but all in all it's a slow, ponderous, dull, plodding piece of celluloid.Beware of a movie that relies on narration to tell a story. Case in point: this movie. Don't talk it, show it.",5,3,5,29 April 2008
American Gangster," Look out for the piano and try to cut out the middle man.
","This is an excellent movie that once again showcases the talent of one of the greatest American actors today, Denzel Washington. This is a DW tour-de-force, another chapter in the illustrious screen career of this outstanding star. There are no accolades that can adequately describe his presence in this movie. Mr. Washington is part Pacino, part Brando, and ... yes ... even part James Cagney. The only drawback to this movie is casting Russell Crowe as a Jewish police officer. Mr. Crowe does his usual fine job, but his portrayal as a 'Jewish' officer was a stretch. This movie also teaches certain facts about how to conduct a business, namely if you cut out the middle man you can reduce overhead, regulate the quality of the product and thereby greatly increase profit. That's a pretty good lesson to learn. The problem is of course that the equation leaves out one factor, the law. If you want to know what that means, watch the movie. By the way, this movie also teaches how to use a piano to discipline employees and why certain employees should not wear clothing. Of course, do you really want your employees going about without clothing?Regarding Russell Crowe being cast as a Jewish police officer, this is another egregious example of the kind of blatant miscasting that can destroy the credibility of a movie. Why would any producer want to cast an actor in a role that the actor can in no way believably project? Mr. Crowe is no more believable as a Jewish police officer then would have been, lets say, James Cagney in a similar role. It just doesn't work, so why do it? By the way, when was the last time a Jewish actor played an Irish cop? Get the point?",8,0,6,6 November 2007
The Reader," Who are the real criminals?
","If any actress deserves to win two Academy Awards for Best Actress in the same year (for Revolutionary Road and The Reader) that actress is Kate Winslet. Kate Winslet is the greatest actress in the world today and proves it again in a stupendous performance in a story that deals with never ending guilt, personal shame and the nature of evil. Only an actress of Ms. Winslet's skill could have performed the role of Hanna Schmidt. Although a concentration camp guard and Nazi war criminal, one can develop a measure of sympathy for this character who herself becomes a victim. At no times does this movie offer any excuses for Schmidt's behavior. She was following orders and it resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, deaths that could have been easily prevented. But was she acting alone? Did she give the orders? Or was she just a cog in a huge murder machine which years later makes her a scapegoat? The audience is presented with a plain-looking but passionate woman who is just trying to survive and has a personal secret which she wants to hide. And although she served in a criminal organization and was party to the commission of horrible crimes, it seems that the real criminals are those who fail to reveal information about her that would have at least mitigated her guilt. Although Ms. Winslet correctly is the star of the movie, the driving character in this story is the boy lover who many years later fails to act to save his one-time lover. The first part of this moving which tries to show the intensity of the initial relationship is unconvincing. There's lots of steamy bedroom scenes but ultimately they fall flat as boy-man is just a little too boyish and Hanna Schmidt is just a little too aloof to convey a sense of a powerful bond. So the audience has to accept as a given that the bond exists in order for the rest of the story to be effective. The movie however does pick up in pace and intensity when the boy now a young man sees his ex-lover on trial for war crimes, crimes that he knows, and has evidence to prove, she could not have committed or at least ordered. The conflict is framed. The players are on the field. Hanna Schmidt is hapless; her secret obvious; her victimization complete. She was doing her job, doing what she was ordered to do. Did that make her a criminal? Indeed, who are the real criminals?Bruno Ganz is great as the boy-man's teacher and mentor.",9,1,2,30 January 2009
Jaws," Classic movie.
","It's a classic. It is one of those timeless movies that contains all the elements of a great work of art. The story is simple, straightforward yet profoundly powerful, with outstanding performances by every member of the cast. This is the kind of movie that Hollywood no longer makes, CAN no longer make and no longer wants to make. It's a movie with a story, devoid of any computerized special effects, depending entirely on the actors to bring the script to life. This movie is so effective that it has become an cinematic icon. The images from this movie have been incorporated into American culture. The impact of this movie on the public has been profound, enduring and unquestionable. Roy Scheider gives one of the great performances. Robert Shaw's performance is equally powerful. They are the stars of this special movie, but the entire cast is excellent. Bravo to Jaws.",10,7,14,19 August 2008
The Wrestler," Wrestling is fake ... or is it? Mickey Rourke gives an incredible performance.
","Not since Requiem for A Heavyweight has Hollywood produced a more intense movie in the sports genre. A beat up, over-the-hill wrestler portrayed as a hero who finds purpose and redemption in what he does best. Mickey Rourke gives one of the great performances in the sports' movie genre. His performance as the wrestler ranks up there with John Garfield's performance as Charlie Davis in Body and Soul and Robert DeNiro's performance as Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull. In some respects Mr. Rourke's performance exceeds that of the aforementioned actors. In addition, kudos to Marisa Tomei's powerful performance as a stripper who befriends the wrestler. What makes this movie even more impressive is that it avoids becoming another sappy Hollywood melodrama and instead stays true to the story, which is about the wrestler. After watching this movie, one may come away with a different impression of professional wrestling. Not a mere bunch of overgrown clowns who make fools of themselves, in this movie they are portrayed with dignity and as performers who do difficult and dangerous work. This movie is wonderful. Congratulations to Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei for a job well done.This movie also provides a respectful and sympathetic portrayal of deli countermen, those unsung workers who toil behind the counters at delis, bagel shops, bodegas and supermarkets. How often is a deli counterman the subject of anything, much less a motion picture? After watching this movie you will have a greater understanding and respect for those hardworking fellows, taken for granted, who toast the bread and slice the meat for a hungry public. Indeed, this movie is actually a tribute to working-class people who, like the wrestler, toil to earn a living.",10,1,2,10 January 2009
Hancock," Superman with an attitude? I don't think so.
","The special effects are quite intriguing. The problem is: this movie, like most Hollywood potboilers, is devoid of any intellectual content. In other words, this movie verges on the brink of outright banality. Not good, not bad, not anything. Why even make this movie? Why not a cartoon instead? Now the movie's main character is supposed to be a hero. Okay, let's talk about heroes. On June 6, 1944, American soldiers invaded Europe on the coast of northern France at a place called Normandy Beach. Their objective: to establish a beach head and begin the liberation of Europe from Nazism. Everyone of those valiant soldiers who participated in that historic event were heroes. So there is no need to for Hollywood to make up heroes. All one has to do is read history books and you will find all the heroes, villains, good guys, and bad guys you want. This movie is proof that Hollywood is now stretching the Superman genre to its limits. Superman with an attitude? Duh. By the way, as good an actor as Will Smith is, he is no Christopher Reeve, or George Reeves for that matter, and Mr. Reeve WAS a hero - a real life hero.",4,3,7,9 July 2008
Kong: Skull Island," Great sci-fi movie; Kong is magnificent.
","What a great movie. Action packed, wonderful acting, tremendous story, fantastic special effects. Instead of being a re-tread of the classic Kong story, it is an original take, with a new plot that fully engages the audience. From start to finish this movie warrants only superlatives. Samuel L. Jackson does some of his best acting in this movie and the rest of the cast provides equally strong performances too. Yet the real star of this movie the c-g of Kong. Kong is what makes this movie happens, Kong is strong, brave and dignified. On the island Kong is a god and a protector. In fact, the special effects department deserves praise for their work in putting together this movie. None of the special effects are gratuitous. Every scene adds to the story's suspense. This is a great movie, definitely worth watching.",10,2,4,6 October 2017
Shooter," Far-fetched (or is it?)
","The movie is far-fetched and clearly another example of the special effects department taking charge (no pun intended). But the movie is has a certain energy that transcends its weaknesses as a work of art, and Mark Wahlberg gives a strong and energetic performance and may be the new Sylvester Stallone. And Danny Glover is very good too as the retired Army Colonel (or is he really a retired Army Colonel?) with a secret agenda. The female actresses are very pretty and supportive of their men (the Wahlberg character has an accomplice), but the main character is the Shooter. The movie poses an interesting question: Are Americans their own worst enemies? This movie calls to mind the story of Senator Joseph McCarthy who warned about subversives infiltrating the government. After watching this movie you may want to consider whether Senator McCarthy may have been right.",8,3,10,24 March 2007
Inception," This movie may put you to sleep
","The problem with this movie is that the plot is too convoluted, thus diverting attention away from the movie's basic premise, that of how the brain functions during sleep. This is a fascinating, esoteric subject but like all fascinating subjects, when Hollywood gets a hold of it, look out! You may be in for a ride, to a place we know not where. A story works best when it has a beginning, a middle and and end. When you tamper with that structure, such as by starting a movie with a flashback, you're inviting confusion and frankly, who wants to go to the movies to be confused. Stories should be told straightforwardly, but that is not the case with this movie. Is Mr. DiCaprio in a dream or not? After a while, it becomes a moot point as the movie just keeps rambling on and on to its inevitable conclusion. Nevertheless, the movie does explore some interesting subjects such as idea formation, mind manipulation, the subconscious and mental activity during sleep. Where the movie stalls is in plausibility and structure. Yet, despite these drawbacks, the movie is worth watching because of Leonardo DiCaprio who once again gives an excellent performance as a stalwart yet troubled mind prober. He carries the movie which alone makes it watchable. Once again Hollywood has taken a perfectly good idea for a movie and has watered it down. Brainwashing is a fascinating subject. It is a key element in The Manchurian Candidate. How do we know that our ideas are actually ours and not planted into our heads? That is the underlying theme of this movie. The problem is, the story itself is so muddled and confusing that at times it becomes a distraction. Leonardi DiCaprio is excellent as a mind prober with emotional issues which get in the way of doing his job. The premise of the story is interesting , especially as it relates to questions of consciousness and unconsciousness and the formulation of ideas during sleep. But then the movie loses focus as the DiCaprio character gets more and more hung up on his emotional problems, thus diverting attention away from the movie's original premise. However, this is a good movie and is worth watching but with this disclaimer: it may put you to sleep.",7,10,25,16 July 2010
Defiance," Remember, it's a movie, not a documentary.
","Since this movie is allegedly based on a true story, this is what this movie 'teaches' about being a Jewish partisan in World War Two: 1. it was a great opportunity to improve your social life, even to get married; 2. Jewish civilians were better soldiers than their German counterparts in the Wehrmacht; 3. Escaping from a Jewish ghetto was easy, just crawl through the hole in the wall while the guards are not looking; 4. it was a great time to learn how to play chess; 5. intellectuals were frowned upon; 6. Jews from time to time went around shooting up towns; 7. Jewish women looked great when cooking food for total strangers in the middle of a forest; 8. sometimes Jewish partisans thought about returning to the ghetto where it seemed safer; 9. Jewish partisans were able to destroy tanks and defeat heavily armed paramilitary troops; 10. Jews were able to walk through miles and miles of swamps without any ill effects. 11. Collaborators were paid 500 rubles for every Jew they turned over to the Germans. Hooray for the movies! Now reality. This movie is excellent escapist fare that may make one feel better about being Jewish. The mere mention World War Two congers up images of Jews being arrested, deported and murdered by the score, by the hundreds, by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, by the hundreds of thousands and by the millions in facilities that were constructed specifically to systematically carry out a state sponsored policy of genocide. Fighting back was not an option. The victims were unarmed and defenseless civilians, a substantial number consisting of pregnant women, the frail elderly and infirmed and small children, including newborn babies. These were the enemies that the Germans had vowed to eradicate. These were the enemies that the German Wehrmacht fought against. And in every country occupied by the Germans, local inhabitants assisted the Germans in prosecuting their policy of genocide. As a work of fiction, movies have license to take liberties with the facts. But when a movie, such as this one, asserts that it is based on a true story, then the movie warrants further scrutiny regarding the veracity of the story and in this case the story seems to be a romanticized account of events that have been schmaltzed up to make the movie more appealing. This movie is certainly worth watching but with this disclaimer: it's a movie, not a documentary. True, some Jews did fight back, such as in Warsaw, and some did organize themselves into partisan groups and when they had the opportunity trounced the Germans, but sustained resistance as independent fighting groups did not happen because it could not. Newborn babies do not make effective soldiers. Jews fighting against the Germans? That's pure Hollywood. It sounds good, looks good, feels good, but is it history?The problem was not with the Jews, it was the Germans. What the Germans did under Adolf Hitler was insane and the question is not why did the Jews not fight back, but rather in what fantasy world were the Germans operating under to want them to fight the Jews?Making a movie about Jews fighting back? Okay, what about this: a movie about the Germans in Hamburg fighting back as Hamburg is being pulverized then burnt by the British and the Americans. The point being, yeah maybe one or two Germans fired guns at the bombers and may have even scored a hit or two, but it was NO CONTEST! Or what about the 'Battle of Cologne' in May 1942 when the British demolished the ENTIRE CITY! Okay, maybe the Germans managed to knock down one or two bombers, but again NO CONTEST! Why always show the Jews being mistreated? Show what happened to the Germans under their Fuehrer who they wholeheartedly supported. While Jews were scrounging for survival in a forest, Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Dusseldorf, and scores of other cities were being systematically destroyed, yet the Germans failed to get rid of Hitler. What were they thinking? Indeed, were they even thinking?",8,2,6,24 January 2009
Lord of War," Why not make a movie about a real 'Lord of War' - Joachim Von Ribbentrop?
","This bizarre, troubling, yet excellent movie is about a sociopath masquerading as a legitimate businessman who is so deluded, cynical and out of touch with his own feelings that he is able to effectively rationalize his own criminality without giving it a second thought. Indeed, according to this movie, the way to make a 'fast buck,' and to marry the woman of your dreams, is not through hard work, or being a law-abiding citizen, but by being a gun runner - and a gun runner who snorts cocaine and flaunts all laws whenever it suits his criminal purposes. But what makes this movie even more chilling is the outstanding performance by Nicolas Cage who aptly portrays a man who on the surface projects an image of civility that belies his sinister activities that promote war. And what is worse, the character works in collusion with government officials of other countries, further underscoring the corruption that marks his nefarious enterprise.This movie brings to mind the career of Nazi Germany's notorious Foreign Minister and war criminal, Joachim Von Ribbentrop. Like the Nicolas Cage character, Von Ribbentrop was also a warmonger, and also like the Nicolas Cage character, was socially adroit, fluent in several languages, a fancy dresser and had a successful marriage to a beautiful woman and had a nice family. Yet anyone familiar with the history of Nazi Germany knows the havoc Von Ribbentrop caused and how his suaveness was a mere facade for a man who was an irresponsible opportunist who promoted war and recklessly helped lead his country to total destruction. The Nicolas Cage character fits the Von Ribbentrop mold. Joachim Von Ribbentrop was the 'Lord of War' who engineered the infamous Nazi German-Soviet Union Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939, which is arguably the biggest single example of outright warmongering in history, where two countries, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, connived, in secret, to obliterate a third country, Poland, and then, to the utter amazement and disbelief of the entire world, DID IT, marking the the start of World War Two. So what about making a movie about Joachim Von Ribbentrop? Or what about making a movie about an actual historical case (a pun, get it?) of gun-running, such as, for example, Lend-Lease where the United States, acting as the 'Arsenal for Democracy,' shipped weapons to the British while ostensibly remaining neutral, or the Soviet Union's amazingly reckless decision to sneak nuclear armed missiles into Cuba, which almost caused a nuclear war? What WERE the Soviet bureaucrats and militarists thinking when they concocted THAT crazy scheme to sneak missiles into Cuba? What WAS that arch-warmonger and real 'Lord of War' Joachim Von Ribbentrop thinking when he concocted that insane treaty with the Soviet Union which all but guaranteed a war? These might provide interesting material for a movie.P.S.: That both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union no longer exist is evidence that even in our war-ravaged world, justice occasionally still does prevail.",10,0,5,20 September 2005
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock the buffoon.
","The name Sherlock Holmes evokes an image of a suave, debonair man of impeccable taste and stalwart character, and then there is this movie which offers a new take on the Sherlock Holmes persona, this time as a frumpish, mumbling, annoying buffoon. True, Sherlock does display fleeting moments of lucidity and genius but for the most part he is a mess. Yet the audience is asked to believe that this broken down Scotland Yard reject can solve complex crimes, beat up the toughest toughs and be involved with a beautiful woman, all of this without any evidence that he actually baths. The only credible part of the movie is the scene where the audience finds out that Holmes hasn't been out of his apartment in weeks, but that is where Sherlock Holmes belongs because on the street he is merely a nuisance, and an annoying nuisance at that. There is no way that this Sherlock Holmes could possibly defeat Professor Moriarity. Holmes is so befuddled that at times he sounds incoherent yet the audience is asked to believe that this man, who at one point manages to get himself shackled to a bed, can actually solve crimes when he has hard time just leaving his apartment. The only thing bleaker than Holmes is London itself. The city is dreary, filthy, dismal and probably reeking with odors, a perfect setting for this downtrodden Holmes and his prissy companion Dr. Watson. Now regarding Dr. Watson .... I'll leave that alone for now.",3,8,16,7 January 2010
The Good Shepherd," If you like long movies with lots of flashbacks, then this movie is for you.
","How bad can a movie be? At what point should the critic stop ragging a movie? The Good Shepherd inspires such questions. It is a long movie. It is a tedious movie. It is, literally, a sleeper. The acting, the story, the direction, is almost amateurish. The main characters are uninteresting, the dramatic conflict contrived, the plot predictable, and whoever plays Matt Damon's son, well, he is arguably the most annoying presence on the movie screen in years. The only time this movie perks up is in the scenes with Robert Di Niro and also when a man takes a flying leap through a window. But the movie's most annoying qualities are its pomposity, its pretentiousness and its repeated use of flashbacks. Hence, a new warning: Beware of the flashback, it can ruin a movie.Also, this movie contains one of the most flagrant examples of miscasting in recent movie memory. The decision to cast Angelina Jolie as a submissive housewife defies logic and is another reason why this movie is truly remarkable but for all the wrong reasons.",3,2,6,1 January 2007
Stalag 17," If you're a fan of Peter Graves, then watch this movie.
","Six hundred sergeants cooped-up in the Nazi German POW camp during World War Two. Six hundred guys who think they're all bosses but with no command responsibilities. Six hundred guys who are angry. And one of them is an informant. The question is: which one? This is a good movie. The acting is first-rate and although the movie is somewhat theatrical, the story helps keep the movie watchable. Peter Graves is great in this movie. His character is both engagingly clever and peculiarly sinister, more so because of Mr. Graves's powerful performance. Who would think that such a wholesome looking soldier would be so loathsome? Who would think that such nice looking man would be so duplicitous? Indeed, Peter Graves's performance overshadows and in fact dominates the movie. In a way this movie is like 'The Westerner,' which ostensibly starred Gary Cooper but in fact was dominated by Walter Brennan, with Mr. Cooper playing a supporting role. It's the same situation in this movie, this time with Mr. Holden playing the supporting role to Mr. Graves.",8,1,5,29 September 2005
The Terminal," Perhaps Tom Hanks' worst movie.
","What an incredibly bad movie. This could be Tom Hanks' worst movie. Everything aspect about the story was contrived. Tom Hanks' performance was contrived. The whole premise of the movie was contrived. The idea of anyone being stuck at an airport and then living there is completely implausible; no way could that happen. Literary license can stretch just so far and in this movie it went way beyond what the rubber band can bear. Every character in this movie was uninteresting, most uninteresting being the drub played by Tom Hanks. His character has to be one of the dumbest Hollywood contrivances in cinematic history. The character is part stupid, part clueless, part hapless and completely unlikable. This movie should have been over the moment his application for a visa was denied. That itself would have been a red flag for airport personnel. That Tom Hanks' gives a sloppy performance can be forgiven. After all, he was working with substandard material. But that a production company actually felt this was a movie worth making is sad. People get stuck at airports all the time; it's one of the drawbacks of traveling. Planes are late, delays occur, bad weather, unanticipated events, but NO ONE ever actually lives in an airport, no matter how egregious the situation, except a man named Victor in a movie called The Terminal.",3,0,1,2 July 2011
Music and Lyrics," Surprsingly good movie.
","From time to time a movie will surprise me and this is one of those movies. I expected another Hollywood flop - insipid, poorly acted, and utterly forgettable. Instead, to my great surprise, this movie was well-acted, had a good story with attractive upbeat characters and was entertaining. In addition, this movie is proof that Hugh Grant is a really wonderful actor. Not only does he have a flare for comedy, he can sing even though he's not known be a singer. And Drew Barrymore gives a wonderful performance as a lyricist. This movie may not win any awards or accolades and probably will soon disappear from the movie theaters, but if that happens that will be too bad because this movie deserves positive recognition.",9,2,4,27 February 2007
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Michael Keaton is back.
","Michael Keaton is back. He thoroughly dominates this movie. He drives it forward, he makes it happen. Keaton's presence is so powerful that it shapes the entire story. This movie is about personal identity, artistic integrity, and the meaning of life. What is someone supposed to do if they believe that their life is a sham and a waste? At what point does the actor as artist stop dishing out garbage to earn a buck? How is one supposed to make sense out of their life when they believe they are a sell out? The story is set in the perfect place to deal with these issues. Where else but in a theater can such varied themes be played out? One can empathize with Riggan's plight as his self-doubt more and more conflicts with his need to achieve something worthwhile. Can he do it? Or is he merely a hack trying to pass himself off as something that he is not? He believes himself to be a failure yet does not accept it. This contradiction generates a tidal wave of emotion that makes Riggan such an incredible character.",10,16,31,24 October 2014
The Big Short," Absurd movie, political polemic masquerading as drama.
","It's easy to target banks and financial institutions as the bad guys whose only goal is to sell overvalued junk to an unsuspecting public. That is the theme of the movie. The political message of this movie is so transparently obvious that it calls into question the movie maker's motivation for making the movie. Obviously, the maker of this movie does not like banks or bankers. The movie goes so far as to assert that financial institutions deliberately defrauded the American public. That makes for a convenient story because it sets up the banks as the bad guys, which is a conventional and time tested plot device for making movies. Yet the movie also disclaims that it is a work of fiction, which is the only factual part of this otherwise turgid and heavy handed attack on the financial system that drives the economy. The fact is that in the world of financial investing, it is impossible to predict outcome. With every investment instrument comes risks. Every mortgage is potentially a financial time bomb that can lose or gain value. What is considered a solid investment can immediately become garbage. To think that the banks know in advance that their holdings are worthless, and that it's time to sell short, means that they are able to predict the future. Besides, what vested interest do banks have to ruin the entire economy? When people were sold homes which were financed through mortgages, everyone, banks and home owners alike, believed that these mortgages were secure. They believed it because the price of homes was going up. Then the bubble burst and the economy took a heavy hit. To suggest, however, that the banks knew IN ADVANCE that this would happen is stretching literary license to the bounds of ridiculousness. It would be like betting on a 'sure bet' at the track and then blaming the track after the sure bet loses on the spurious claim that the track knew in advance that the horse would not win. That's the nature of gambling, which is what speculation is about. The good guys in this movie are four stock brokers. They are the good guys because they have a conscience and know that what they are trading is junk. Yet they still trade, which shows that they are just as greedy as the rest. The premise of this movie is absurd. However, the premise of the story notwithstanding, the movie contains several string performances. Steve Carell dominates this movie. In a performance that goes against his typical kind of role, he plays a stock broker who has to make decisions that put his sense of morality to the test. To learn what he does, watch the movie.",5,3,8,19 January 2016
Prometheus," Immensely important cinematic work of art.
","As much as I wanted to dismiss this movie as just some more sfx fluff, I cannot because it would not be true. This is an excellent movie which has a strong story and an excellent cast that does a great job in portraying their respective characters. This movie succeeds in keeping the audience's attention and raises some interesting questions regarding the origins of humanity. The movie's story, although science fiction, is plausible. Other planets exist in the universe and if we ever visit one of those planets, who knows what will be found? The introduction of some dangerous and bizarre life forms adds immeasurably to the story's strength, but the the best part of the movie is the performance by Michael Fassbender who plays a sinister but fascinating robot. His performance is exceptional. There is nonstop action and excitement as humans grapple with all kinds of dangers as they attempt to expand the frontiers of knowledge. The brilliance of this movie is equaled only by the immensity of the production itself. This movie is a monumental effort which cleverly combines all facets of movie-making into one supreme work of art that attempts to go way beyond the commonplace and humdrum and into areas that not only stimul8 the senses but challenge the intellect. Science fiction need not be just a bunch of flashy special effects and scary creatures. This movie injects the element of science into the story; it's more than just an updated rehash of Godzilla or Rodan. The chaos in the movie is more than just some haphazard acting-out by enraged extraterrestrials. Instead, the movie is suggesting something much deeper, more profound and infinitely more sublime. It is reaching for answers to questions that have puzzled humanity since the dawn of time. From whence did we come and to what are we going? The chemistry between the actors becomes apparent in scene after scene as fear and passion combine to produce some of the most intense dramatic scenes in the history of the sci-fi genre. The female leads are beautiful; the male leads appropriately manly and the alien creatures delightfully scary. This is a prequel to a movie that was made thirty years ago, yet there is no need to have watched the original to appreciate this contemporary story. No effort is spared to give the audience the thrills and chills that are the mark of gr8 movie-making. Hollywood deserves accolades for having produced such a wonderful movie. Charlene Theron once again proves that she is one of the premier actresses in cinema today, and Guy Pearce's rendition of an elderly man is absolutely fabulous; it's even better than Brad Pitt's rendition in Benjamin Button. 1 can only marvel at all the talent displayed in this movie; everything suggests creativity at a level that is breathtaking. One can respond with amazement at the incredible vistas of another part of the universe light years away from earth depicted in this movie. Who are the precursors of the humans? Watch this movie to find out the answer.",10,3,13,12 June 2012
Paths of Glory," Scapegoating is such a dirty business.
","This is a great movie. The story is compelling, the acting powerful, the theme sublime. This movie is about how the individual person can be reduced to the level of a mere statistic, a mere dot on somebody's organizational plan, a mere object to be sacrificed and never be missed by those in charge, who have their own personal agendas and will do ANYTHING to avoid taking responsibility when things go wrong. A military operation fails, and the general in charge is angry and he will not be the one stuck with the blame. As far as this general is concerned, the soldiers are a bunch of lazy, cowardly slackers who don't want to fight - even though the soldiers are dying by the thousands. But that is of no concern to the general who wants to blame someone for the failed operation because if the general takes responsibility he will be revealed for what he is: an egocentric, incompetent martinet who is interested in only one thing - furthering his career at the expense of the soldiers under his command. To pursue that selfish goal, this general will throw away the lives of the soldiers entrusted to him. This movie stars Kirk Douglas. But the real star of this movie is Adolph Menjou who plays the French general. On July 1, 1916, the British lost over 57,000 men killed or wounded while the Germans lost 8,000, with no appreciable gains, tactically or strategically. What an extravagant squandering of human life. But the generals in charge, who did the squandering, lived to fight another day.",6,0,0,22 October 2005
Paths of Glory," Not that good. The movies fails to make a case against the general.
","It is World War One. France is fighting Germany. The Germans occupy a certain hill. Higher command ordered Mireau to take the hill, Mireau obeys, devises a plan to take the hill, knowing that casualties will be high, and gives the order to move out. Some soldiers move out, then (without orders) retreat and some stay in the trenches. To get the soldiers to obey, Mireau even orders French artillery to deliberately shell the troops. What a mess. Of course, the attack fails. Mireau refuses to accept responsibility for the failed attack and blames the failure on the troops for refusing to obey orders. Mireau orders one hundred soldiers to be immediately executed for cowardice, but is persuaded to reduce that number to three. Three soldiers, each one an enlisted man, are selected. A court martial is quickly convened, finds the three soldiers guilty of cowardice in the face of the enemy. and sentence them to execution by firing squad. The next day the order os carried out. the movie attempts to depict the three soldiers as victims of an nasty and incompetent general who uses the court martial to cover his own incompetency. The movie tries to depict Mireau as the villain and the three soldiers as his hapless victims. Kirk Douglas stars as Colonel Dax, Mireau's chief of staff and the person responsible for leading the attack, who is the personification of righteous indignation. The movie fails to make a case against Mireau. At the court martial, one soldier admits that he never left the trench, another that he moved out only to the French barbed wire, and the third that he retreated without being ordered. The movie makes a case that the the three soldiers were afforded less than adequate due process but fails to make a case that Mireau was a villain. First, the troops refused to obey his orders. Second, selecting individual solders for collective punishment was standard practice at the time. Third. higher command knew that the attack would result in lots of casualties. Fourth, Colonel Dax, who was the officer placed in charge of the actual attack, failed to rally the troops. Fifth, Mireau was doing his job. Sixth, it was war. Seventh, Mireau's orders were lawful. Eighth, if anyone should have been assigned blame, it was Colonel Dax whoi harbored personal animus toward General Mireau. Kirk Douglas received top billing, but the principal character was General Mireau, played by George Macready. The movie was about injustice - against a General who was set up to fail and then take the blame. UNFAIR.",6,0,5,22 July 2019
X-Men: First Class," Lively movie; weak story
","How can one judge a movie that on its face is campy? Can a campy movie be judged on the same basis as let's say a non-campy movie? This movie is highly entertaining, yet tells a story that is so absurd that it's almost laughable, and the movie is not a comedy. The mutants are wonderful and their powers are impressive, but so what? The audience can relate to a character like, let's say, Superman, who has super powers but otherwise is no different from his human counterparts. X-men however are quite different which makes them a less lovable, far more weird, and potentially more menacing. One does not have to be concerned that Batman is going to to a number on Gotham City or that Spiderman is going to weave a huge web around his friends. Yet one is not sure about these X-men. Some are good and some are bad. It makes for a lively movie with lots of special effects and all kinds of story twists which grabs and keeps the audience's attention, yet leaves one wondering: why do these X-men exist in the first place? What is their mission?",8,0,2,14 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Very good movie.
","To my utter surprise, this is a good movie. Despite the usual dose of special effects and a story that tests the boundaries of plausibility, this movie succeeds as cinematic entertainment. The reason for this is the cast. The movie is well acted. Christian Bale plays Batman with an intensity that transforms the character from a two-dimensional comic book figure into a complex human being, with strengths and weaknesses. Ann Hathaway is stunning as the Bat Woman. Not only is she beautiful, she invests her character with feelings that make her endearing without being corny or sappy. Gary Oldham gives what may be the best rendition of Commissioner Gordon. Tom Hardy is outstanding as the bad guy and Batman's foil. Watching this movie, one can actually begin to care about the Batman. Soon the contrivances in the story recede into the background as one wonders whether the Batman will survive.",9,2,9,8 September 2012
Iron Man," Moral behavior sometimes takes courage.
","Excuse me while I recover from the shock and amazement caused by my extreme surprise that this is an excellent movie. I expected the usual vacuous Hollywood hokum with the usual Hollywoodish heavy handed combination of outlandish special effects masking a superficial story and two-dimensional characters and instead was treated to an actual well-acted, well-crafted science fiction story with actual character development within the framework of an interesting plot. Robert Downey gives a marvelous, surprisingly powerful performance as a hugely wealthy, arrogant arms merchant who undergoes a major personality transformation - for the better. This movie is entertaining from start to finish and is worth watching.This movie is, for Hollywood, a rare combination of special effects extravaganza combined with a substantive story that actually has some dramatic content. This movie dramatizes the problems caused by industrial activity that gains profits through war and how special interests can completely drive and distort a country's foreign policy. That there are some in our society who reap huge profits off the suffering of others is a sad commentary, which is a theme of this movie. The Iron Man is representative of what happens when someone decides to take the high moral road. To survive, the main character has to literally wear a suit of hard metal to fend off the attacks from those whose profiteering schemes are now threatened.",10,2,5,9 May 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Why laugh at one super hero when you can laugh at two?
","Combine a muddled story, cheesy acting, gratuitous special effects, canned violence, and an inept script, and what you have is this movie. Unintended laughter abounds as the Bat and the Man of Steel square off for reasons that only a Hollywood script writer testing the limits of credulity could concoct. Replete with numerous defects, which, among its many flaws, includes a massive and transparent rip off of the conclusion of the King Kong story (albeit with unintended amusing results), the movie struggles to try to pass itself off as serious entertainment. Yet the story is so goofy that after a while it can't help but provoke laughter. That Ben Affleck is able to deliver his lines without breaking into laughter is alone worthy of accolades to his power of self-control. As the movie goes on, and it's a long movie, one soon wishes that Adam West would enter to inject at least a small modicum of class into this messy production. Jesse Eisenberg plays Lex Luthor in one of Hollywood's more egregious, albeit hilarious, examples of miscasting. Yet, the star of the show is Henry Cavil whose cheesy, leaden performance as Superman borders on the ridiculous. Whenever Superman enters the scene it is sure signal that something inane will soon follow. In the middle of the fight scene, for instance, both heroes discover that both of their mothers are named Martha. Why this bit of trite is important to the story will not be revealed here. However, this revelation marks the height of drama achieved by this movie. What makes this movie especially noteworthy, however, is how it succeeds in reducing not one but two American comic book icons from heroes to buffoons and achieves this with little effort. Now THAT is an accomplishment. Why laugh only at one super hero when you can laugh at two? Of the two, the one who is more inane is Batman. Without Alfred, there can be no Batman. Superman at least has an excuse - he's not human, so we really can't expect that much from him. If you are expecting a serious drama involving two troubled super heroes, then you will be sorely disappointed. But if you like poorly made movies with quirky lines, stagy acting and cartoon-like special effects, then this production will prove immensely satisfying.",3,31,60,28 March 2016

This movie had humor, a good story, solid acting and and overall endearing quality lacking in most, or more accurately practically all movies churned out of the Hollywood movie-making machine. Jim Carrey was actually FUNNY and Jennifer Anniston was wonderful. Morgan Freeman was commanding and Steve Carell was funny too. The scenes with Mr. Carrey and Mr. Freeman were really excellent, well scripted and well acted, making for a compelling movie worthy of positive attention. There might be some who may object to the movie's portrayal of God, but those objections notwithstanding, it's a respectful portrayal and one which helps the audience to better appreciate the pitfalls as well as the benefits of divine power. Excellent movie.",10,6,10,17 December 2007
Ben-Hur," Great Movie
","'Where's my mother and my sister?' The scene when Ben Hur confronts Messala is enough to make this film worth watching. Charlton Heston as outstanding in the title role, but the performance that really was extraordinary was that of Stephen Boyd as Messala. Mr. Boyd's portrayal of the sinister Messala is uncanny. In fact, if it wasn't for Mr. Boyd, this movie would have run out of steam and become just another overblown Hollywood biblical epic. Another wonderful performance is that of Jack Hawkins as the Roman proconsul who is saved by Ben Hur and ultimately adopts Ben Hur, which allows Ben Hur to return to Judea to search for his mother and sister, who Messala had imprisoned out of sheer spite for Ben Hur. Of course, this movie contains two classic moments: first, when Ben Hur returns to Judea as the Roman proconsul's adopted son and in one of the greatest scenes in movie history confronts Messala and demands to know the whereabouts of his mother and sister; and second, the chariot race where Ben Hur, wearing the Star of David and now hero of the people, defeats Messala.

Casino Royale," A fallible and gullible James Bond
","If I've said it once I've said it a thousand times: 'Beware of the hype.' There is an inverse relationship between the level of hype and the quality of a movie, and proof of this is this movie. The opening title song is awful, the story inane, and this James Bond is a far cry from the invincible hero of films from the past. Daniel Craig gives a credible performance as a fallible and gullible James Bond and the the leading ladies are lovely, especially Vesper.

The movie contains a compelling plot, wonderful acting, excellent cinematography, and a powerful theme. The movie immediately engages the audience and effectively sets forth the moral issues confronting the principal character. The movie has a great cast, but Mel Gibson is definitely in center stage, with all the action revolving around his character. Although the special effects may seem subdued by contemporary standards, they actually help to enhance the drama, especially relating to the depiction of the aliens. This movie could have easily a War of the Worlds remake, but the director deftly avoids that pitfall, leaving the audience to ponder larger, more esoteric questions that deal with the nature of existence.",9,1,6,23 October 2011
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," An Open Letter to Woody Allen
","Dear Mr. Allen: While I struggled to watch your movie, which cost me a certain amount of money and time, I could not help but arrive at this thought: maybe it is time for you to retire. I don't say this lightly. After all, you are fully entitled to continue pursuing your career but if you do, try not to duplicate this ponderous, pretentious clunker that was trying to make some kind of statement about people and relationships and life, but winds up just feeding the audience a bunch of pseudo-philosophical mush. If you're going to tell a story, at least try to make it interesting and ease off on the use of narratives. The characters in this story are uninteresting, uninspiring and unlikable and if you were trying to create another Sideways for women, it does not work. Your movie lacks the freshness and zest that made Sideways so wonderful. Relationships come and go, people are fickle and confused and are chronically wanting more to fill in the emptiness. We already know that and you don't have you take it upon yourself to try to drive these points home because frankly who can like a movie that goes out of its way to make people feel sad.Also, your movie deals with issues such as marital infidelity, mental illness, cultural conflict and anger but does so in such a heavy-handed and pedestrian way that by the time the movie is over ... and in this movie time drags ... nothing has been resolved, everything is a mess, the characters go on with their lives and the conflicts persist. The American men are portrayed as vacuous wimps, the Spanish man as a cloddish fool, his ex-wife as a shrieking banshee and the American women as weak, suggestive dummies. Wow, what a movie! So Mr. Allen, please don't make another movie like this. Do a remake of Play It Again Sam instead.By the way, your movie causes me to wonder whether you ever watched the movie For Whom The Bells Toll with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman. This movie is also set in Spain but unlike your movie, the characters, especially the women, are strong and resourceful. Or let's contrast the mushy characters in your movie with those found in Double Indemnity or Mildred Pierce. Mr. Allen, please ... Please ... PLEASE do not make another movie like Vicky Christina Barcelona. All you are doing is perpetuating groundless stereotypes that are not funny.",4,23,47,27 August 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Cate Blanchett is wonderful
","This movie approaches the brink of becoming another corny, hokey Hollywood travesty but recovers to become an incredibly powerful and unique portrayal of Elizabeth I and her closest advisers and the political situation in Western Europe in the late 16th century. Cate Blanchett offers a masterful, powerful and provocative portrayal of the Virgin Queen which unlike most Hollywood portrayals of historical personages does not devolve into a laughable caricature. Elizabeth has feelings too and cares about ALL of her people, not just those who are of her religious persuasion. Also, the movie offers a credible portrayal of Elizabeth's relationship with her cousin Mary as well as a credible and comprehensible explanation of King Philip's decision to go to war against England. Whether Spain in 1585 was the most powerful country in the world as the movie purports is a matter for debate but the fact that there was a time in history when Spain actually wanted to invade England is amazing and is a story in itself. This movie is worth watching.",10,77,126,12 October 2007
The Deer Hunter," Epic movie.
","This movie is an epic. It is about the brutalizing effect of war, not only on the direct participants, but for those back home. Everyone is impacted; everything is changed. People are forced to deal with issues relating to loss, especially of innocence. There is nothing that prepares them for the consequences of what they experience, neither for the men who go and fight or for those at home who care for them. The movie is a study of contrast between two friends, one who survives and tells a story, the other, who succumbs to the trauma that distorts his mind. It is about a man who undergoes a transformation through fire. The movie avoids becoming melodramatic. It tells a story instead. Everyone in the movie is affected by the war. Many scenes are poignant. The movie avoids moralizing about the Vietnam War and instead lets the story speaks for itself. The Russian roulette scenes are powerful and evocative. They are a metaphor for the uncertainty of life. Like with the Americans, the Vietnamese are shown as being brutalized too. Brutalization is the recurrent theme. Everywhere there is violence. Yet, one man rises about it - Michael. He had gone through hell and has survived without losing his mind or his dignity. The movie is long but maintains a quick pace. The movie is about perseverance, courage and hope. It is about home, family and community. It is about personal strength. It is about human vulnerability. It is about friendship. It is about returning to home and reuniting with people. It is about the United States. It is about the world.Actually this movie is about what happens when people are forced to deal with change. The main character, Michael, is a tower of strength, but he doesn't know that, at first. He is just one of the guys, a worker, nobody special; he has his friends; people like him. He's a little distant emotionally but nothing that really interferes with his socializing. In short, there's nothing particularly remarkable about him. Then he goes to war and in war he is tested and his inner strength comes out and he is able to maintain his emotional balance while his friends cannot. He comes home, injured but intact. People know that he has changed - for the better. They now know that he is strong, not just physically, but psychologically. Robert DeNiro is brilliant in this movie. The entire movie revolves around his character and he does a great job, which made this movie into a great movie. In this movie, everyone is affected by change. Nobody is the the same. Their complacency is shattered; they are left with uncertainty. Michael is struggling to keep himself together; he knows what happened to his pals. The character Linda is beautiful and she is strong. She plays a key role in the story. This is a great movie.",Null,0,1,3 September 2011
Beowulf," Be gone, oh rotten movie! Hollowman and Alien vs. Predator! - you have company.
","Remember when your English teacher in high school or college told the class that one of their assignments was to read Beowulf? Not exactly the most popular work of literature. Really, how many people out there actually had, or have, any interest in reading Beowulf? Be honest. It would not be unreasonable to say that Beowulf is not on the list of the world's most popular literary works. Yet Hollywood, in its infinite quest for profit, decided that this is the kind of story that can be transposed onto the big screen and that there is an audience for this kind of story, with its heroes and villains and monsters and ... well you get the point. So Hollywood concocted this movie, part science fiction, part science fantasy, part epic and COMPLETE JUNK. Welcome to the world of special effects. After watching this movie, one can reasonably ask: Why have actors? Why not just special effects and who cares about the story? If the story is idiotic ... who cares? Just throw in some special effects. If the dialog is laughable? Who cares? That can be cured with special effects. If the plot is ridiculous, again, who cares? Special effects can do the trick. There are scenes in this movie that provoke outright laughter. If this movie accurately portrays the level of civilization in Europe circa 6th century A.D., then it is a miracle that people actually survived. If you believe this movie, then the people, particularly the men, were actually uglier than the monsters, except, of course, for Beowulf who, of course, is an Adonis while all the other guys are a bunch of overweight gin-guzzling jerks or skinny sniveling dorks who are too stupid to do anything except let themselves be kicked around or sacrificed for the hero, who, of course, has sex with beautiful women. This raises another point: In the 6th century why are the men so ugly while the women are so beautiful? It's like their two different species, with the men being like links between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal Man (except of course for Beowulf who is perfection personified - duh!) and the women being more like a bunch of giggling Aphrodites than poverty-stricken 6th century females just trying to survive. (I wonder what kind of odors women emitted in the 6th century? After all, bathing was not one of their priorities.) What about the female of females in the movie, the super-Monster, who is also a mother, yes, A MOTHER, played, surprise, surprise, by Angelina Jolie! Some super-monster! There are mothers and there are MOTHERS and Ms. Jolie plays A MOTHER!!! If Ms. Jolie's mother character is supposed to be a monster, than bring her on because any monster that looks like the beautiful and talented Angelina Jolie is the kind of monster that one should have at home, or at work, or wherever. One other point: There are parts of this movie where certain characters speak a language that be best described as gibberish. It would have been helpful if those parts of the movie had included subtitles. Then again, maybe the entire script should have been in gibberish. As a matter of fact, this movie would have been far more interesting if the entire script had been written in Old English - without subtitles. Why have Beowulf speaking fluent English? Why have Beowulf speaking at all? What it comes down to is this: this movie is pretentious junk that tries to be part Hamlet, part Troy, and even part Alexander (the latter two not the greatest movies but light years better than this waste of celluloid) but actually is a hyped-up pseudo-cartoon version of a medieval story that probably no person has read in its entirety in maybe a thousand years but which someone in Hollywood believed could be transformed into something that today's contemporary audience would buy, meaning (must it be said? Yes!) - SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!! - and in 3D!!!! Hollywood made 3D movies in the 1950s - for kids and back then the movies cost a quarter and nobody made any big deal about it. Now 3D is supposed to be something special. Yeah, right. Leave Beowulf in the the book where he belongs so that the lone person who decides to actually read the book can use their imagination to visualize the story instead of having to rely on Hollywood's version - which is crass, banal and guided not by the quest for artistic excellence but by the quest for the almighty buck.This movie is so bad that it makes Phantom of the Opera (movie version) seem like a 10-star classic. You can take special effects just so far, but special effects cannot replace a story, no way. This movie is about phantasmagorical events revolving around themes such as heroism, selflessness and other high personal virtues. Okay, but the movie approaches these themes by catering to the lowest common denominator of intelligence to dramatize these points. If Beowulf is the best example of English literature from the Middle Ages, then the middle ages were the dark ages indeed.Now here's an idea: Why not take Godzilla, King Kong, Rodan, Mothra, the Giant Mantis, the Predator (with the infra-red vision and the a-bomb strapped to its arm)and the T-Rex from Jurassic Park and put them on an island with Beowulf and see what happens? All special effects. NO STORY NECESSARY.Anthony Hopkins's presence in this movie is a travesty, a joke. It's not his fault. It's a gig and a paycheck, and he didn't create the role, he just acts it. But to have this fine actor going about half-naked would have been like Hamlet going about with his pants down while engaged in a soliloquy. Please, be gone, oh rotten movie, go to DVD-land with all the other forgettable rejects.",1,6,14,30 November 2007
Speed," Can a city bus actually go 50 mph without falling apart?
","Okay, the story is exciting, the acting is excellent, and it's definitely one of the better action movies, but ... BUT ... asking the audience to believe that a city bus can sustain a speed of 50 mph nonstop for one and half hours in the middle of a city without breaking down stretches the bounds of credulity. Maybe a Mazda, maybe a Porsche, maybe even a Greyhound or Short Line bus, or maybe even your standard commuter bus could have functioned intact, but an inner city bus? NO WAY!! It's enough that these buses work at all, much less that they could go 50 mph without breaking down within five minutes (okay let's make it ten minutes). It would have been more realistic if the bus was required to maintain a constant speed of, let's say, 20 mph. Now that would been far more believable and realistic. But when that bus does its flying act, like the General Lee flying through the air in the 'Dukes of Hazard' or Burt Reynolds and Sally Fields doing the same in 'Smokey and the Bandit,' that's when I knew that this movie had moved into the realm of science fiction. It would have been more believable to have had the bus launched into orbit around the earth, or to the moon.",7,0,1,10 October 2005
Live Free or Die Hard," Excellent action movie with a serious message
","To my great surprise this was an excellent movie. Not exactly Shakespeare or anything highbrow but definitely a full entertainment package that will please all who enjoy action thrillers that border on the science-fiction genre. But when you get beyond the special effects and all the noise, the movie poses serious questions: Is the United States vulnerable to computer-based terrorism? Has computer technology become the Achilles' heal of modern society? Bruce Willis gives another excellent performance as John McClane but also impressive is Maggie Q who could be the next Sandra Oh. Ms. Q doesn't say much in this movie but her actions definitely speak volumes. She's all business and she's dynamite.",9,2,5,23 July 2007
Lucy," Poor Mr. Jang.
","The movie works because the bad guy doesn't have a chance, except he does not know it. The bad guy, in this case, is Mr. Jang. He is vicious, mean, a thug, and rotten to the core, but compared to his adversary there is really no contest. His adversary, a young lady named Lucy, is someone whose brain is operating at full-throttle, and that is gist of the story - everyone else's brain are operating at only a small fraction of its total potential, hence Lucy is literally operating in another dimension. Under these conditions, Mr. Jang cannot win. The premise of the story, that humans use only a small fraction of their mental capacity, is pure science fantasy and completely unsupported by fact, but for the purpose of this movie, it's as good as any other myth. In her normal state Lucy is harmless, but as her brain power keeps increasing so does her powers which enable her to perform acts that defy the laws of physics. And that too is explained by the movie. But to learn that explanation the movie should be watched. Why spoil an interesting story?",8,9,27,30 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," First-rate entertainment.
","This movie is excellent. The reason is because it has strong acting and an original story. This movie is not a rip off of earlier Star Wars movies. It is something new. The movie is engaging. It grabs and keeps that audience's attention. The characters evoke empathy. The story contains an element of tragedy. The director, J.J. Abrams manages to avoid using special effects to fill in story gaps. For once, special effects are actually ancillary to the story line. Some scenes contain real elements of drama. Abrams manages to avoid depicting the good guys and bad guys as caricatures. The most interesting character is Kylo Ren played by Adam Driver. The reuniting of Han Solo and Princess (now General) Leia is dramatic without being sentimental. It's good that they are together again. Of course, the Solo-Leia-Ren triad drives the story. However, this movie is not an overblown soap opera. Rather it is a well put together science fiction adventure that provides first-rate entertainment.",10,3,41,2 February 2016
RED," A noisy sleeper. John Malkovich as comic actor.
","John Malkovich is a great actor. His name is associated with many great movies. Now Mr. Malkovich reveals his skill as a comic actor. He carries the movie. He makes this movie watchable. Every scene with Mr. Malkovich is amusing and often funny. He may be the best comic actor in Hollywood today. His performance represents a major departure from his usual roles and it works. This movie has some funny moments. It has a lot of action. Things explode. The characters are quirky. There is lots of noise. There are chase scenes. There are witty one-liners. There are good guys. There are bad guys. Yet, that will not stop you from taking a nap in the middle of the movie. The movie is a Hollywood potboiler. It comes out of the same mold that has spewed out countless action flicks over the years. The movie will make you laugh. The movie will make you wonder, 'How did they do that explosion?' The movie will also make you sleep because the story is devoid of anything that even remotely challenges the intellect. If you want slapstick-like action, then this movie is for you. If you want a movie with lots of noise, then this movie is for you. If you want a movie that will stimulate your thought process, then bring a pillow and enjoy your nap.",8,2,3,20 October 2010
Flight," It's about taking responsibility.
","Denzel Washington gives a masterful performance as a poly-substance abuser who finallyis forced to confront the truth ... about himself. It is about a man living a lie until it catches up with him, with tragic results. For the story is a tragedy. It depicts a good man brought down by a serious character flaw. Nobody can help him; he can only help himself. The principal character, Whip, has many good traits and is actually an engaging character ... when he is sober. But his engaging personality is a façade that conceals huge emotional problems. Yet Whip is neither contrived nor implausible. Indeed, he is a metaphor for anyone with a serious substance abuse issue. Thus, the movie can resonate with any adult audience. Thus movie challenges the audience to take stock of their own possible substance abuse, a problem which, sadly, is all too pervasive in a society that not only condones but actively encourages people to drink and smoke. The movie's depiction of a man destroying himself is neither melodramatic or overblown. Instead, it provides a provocative dramatization of a problem that adversely effects so many people in so many adverse ways. For this story to be effective, the audience must be convinced that Whip is in fact culpable. This point the movie skirts. Did the plane crash because of mechanical failure or because of Whip's erratic, yet heroic, flying? This the movie never fully reveals. The audience must decide for itself who is really to blame. The movie also provides a realistic dramatization how various interest groups who could be adversely effected by the crash mobilize their resources to protect their interests, with the truth taking a backseat. The union, the airlines, the government, and Whip himself all act to protect themselves and transfer blame to others. Nobody wants their feathers ruffled, and it is in this context that Whip is finally forced decide if he will act like a man.",10,1,4,4 June 2014
Unbroken," It was brutal being a POW under the Japanese.
","The story is about two men: an American prisoner of war, Louis Zamperini, and a Japanese prison guard, Mutihiro Watanabe, who torments him. The movie devotes a lot of time telling the audience about Zamperini but provides almost nothing about Watanabe, thus transforming the latter into a stereotype. Watanabe's violence comes off as gratuitous; why he targets Zamperini in particular is never fully explained, and in order for the story to make sense, an explanation is required. Yet on one point the movie is utterly clear: the brutality of the Japanese in their treatment of the prisoners of war. The sheer mindlessness of the brutality is depicted with candor and frankness. There is no question that in this movie the Japanese are brutal as a matter of policy. It was brutality motivated by sheer hatred. Watanabe hates his prisoners; he hates Zamperini. His hatred is so intense that he cannot put it into words. He can only act on it. That any Americans at all survived incarceration under these circumstances is a miracle. True, Japan and the United States were engaged in a vicious war but still, there was no valid excuse to them to forgo even the pretensions of legality in the treatment of the prisoners. For the Japanese, the prisoners were not only the enemy but were still combatants who just happned to be prisoners. The movie is crammed with violence; everything in this story is violent. Watanabe vents his rage on Zamperini. After he is 'rescued' by the Japanese, Zamperini becomes a punching bag for the disgruntled Watanabe. What is disturbing is that such scenes are not merely gratuitous depictions of violence meant to intensify the story but are based on historical incidents that actually occurred. Zamperini did not deserve to be mistreated. Why the Japanese chose to take the low road of brutality is never fully answered.",8,0,5,17 January 2015
Rear Window," James Stewart at his best.
","James Stewart fans will enjoy this movie. Stewart drives this movie forward. The movie also provides an interesting glimpse of contemporary urban life. Although the movie is a crime drama, it depicts the compartmentalization of existence and the isolation of individuals in large groups. People live in the same building, yet there is no sense of community. A murder can take place and nobody would even know it. The most nefarious acts could take place and nobody would know it. People living in close proximity yet emotionally so disconnected. This is captured by this movie. The social statement may be unintentional yet it is unmistakable. The format of the story itself does not seem complicated: a man watches his neighbors and believes that something bad has happened. The problem is in trying to prove it. Hitchcock uses several clever devices to heighten the suspense. But it is the acting of James Stewart that takes precedence. This is James Stewart at his best.",10,0,1,11 August 2014
Munich," Beware! You are entering a cinematic mine field.
","Did Steven Spielberg personally direct this movie? I hope not because if he did then maybe it's time for him to move on to something else. Munich has to be one of the worst, if not THE worst movie ever made. Now, Hollywood makes a lot of clunkers, which are pretty bad, but nobody is trying to peddle them off as being anything but what they are - crumby, stupid, poorly made movies. Well, Munich is all that, but what makes it particularly atrocious is its overbearing pretentiousness. This is a three-hour exercise in gratuitous violence, poor acting, unbelievably inane scenes and a muddled political message. For instance, the scene where Israeli commandos attack a terrorist stronghold - dressed in pantyhose! Or the laughable portrayal of Golda Meir as a Jewish grandmother-type surrounded by all her 'boys' (it may be of interest to know that Golda Meir led Israel through two wars and was one of two women to have signed the Israeli Declaration of Independence); or the premeditated and cold-blooded assassination of a beautiful young sexy woman, dressed only in a negligee, by three heavily armed Israeli men on the PRESUMPTION that she was responsible for someone's death; or the idea that an Israeli agent could pass himself off as a German; or ... well by now you should get the point. This movie is one of those Hollywood clunkers that belong with all those other pretentious pieces of claptrap that strive to convey an 'important' message, but instead inspire the warning: 'Beware - you are entering a cinematic mine field. Watch this movie at your own risk. And if you fall asleep in the middle of the movie or leave the theater before the movie is over and feel like you wasted your hard-earned money, don't say we didn't warn you.'",1,15,30,10 January 2006
Looper," One of the better movies of the sci-fi genre.
","This is a great sci-fi movie. It's about an assassin, called a looper, who is hired to kill people sent to the past from the future. If this seems confusing, it is, and that's intentional. The problem is: what happens when the victim sent back is the assassin? That means killing yourself, or, as it's put in the movie, 'closing the loop.' Nice euphemism, right? Anyway, this one particular assassin is set to kill his next victim when he notices that the victim is himself, just older. Well, needless to say, but say it I will, mayhem breaks lose, because in the world of the loopers, if you don't do your job, then you have to be eliminated. (Eliminated: that's another euphemism.) You may be wondering: why have loopers? The answer to that question is because this story is set in the not so far distant future, after some kind of major upheaval, leaving humanity wrecked and presenting a perfect opportunity for organized crime to flourish. In the future time travel is discovered, but it's illegal, which means, of course, that only criminals use it. But in the future, when the syndicate eliminates someone, they cannot dispose of the body, hence, they transport the victim to the past for processing. Okay, now that we got that muddled explanation out of the way, here's what happens in the movie: the looper is now searching for his older self because his older self wants to murder a child who, in the future, will be the head of the crime syndicate who gets the older looper-self's wife murdered. That's right: it's a vendetta. Now, the younger looper-self learns that the child, a boy, lives on a farm with a woman who is the sister of the boy's mother. Now, the boy's mother was killed after the boy unleashed telekinetic forces that smashed everything in its path. Oh, before I forget, I need to mention that after the cataclysmic events that messes up the world, about ten percent of the population comes down with a mutation that gives them telekinetic powers which nobody knows how to use. Okay, now back to the looper and the boy. The looper finds the boy and they form an emotional bond. Finally, to bring this synopsis to an end, the older-looper-self arrives at the farm, and is trying to kill the boy, who has just unleashed a humongous telekinetic blast, but instead kills the sister-mother, and so the looper kills himself. The reason why the looper kills himself is because he realizes that by sacrificing his life, he will save the life of the mother and that in turn will change the course of history because instead of the boy growing up bitter and unloved, and becoming the head of the criminal syndicate in the future, he will have a mother to care for him. Thus, the looper becomes a martyr and a hero. This movie is saturated with violence because the story is violent. Bruce Willis is fabulous as the older-looper-self. He carries this movie; it's probably his best role and performance in years. The story itself is intriguing and clever, and the movie does an excellent job of telling a story without an over-reliance on special effects, which are kept to a minimum.",9,1,4,7 October 2012

'Don't expect anything particularly special.' Admit it, that's what you would think. Well, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT!!!! Yes, I was channel-surfing and came across this movie and said to myself, 'Let me watch this movie to see how bad it is.' Wow, was I in for a surprise. This movie was EXCELLENT!!!! Not only is the movie well-acted, it actually has an excellent story with interesting characters with depth. This movie is about sacrifice, about duty and about loyalty. This movie is proof that when given good material, Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell will come through with flying colors. It is their best movie.",10,4,8,27 February 2007
The Replacements," Losers can be winners too.
","Although this movie is about scabs, and the people who enable them, the movie is surprisingly upbeat, although not necessarily amusing. The movie is about people being given a second chance, although in this case at other people's expense. The movie also is about how a good coach can turn losers into winners and how it is often impossible to differentiate the two. Keanu Reeves is wonderful in the principal role of Shane Falco, a washed up quarterback, who is brought back from oblivion to enjoy a moment of glory. Brooke Langton is positively charming as the cheer leader who literally cheers on Falco. However, the strongest performance is by Gene Hackman who plays Falco's coach and who has to make a decision which puts his moral courage to the test.",8,0,2,17 February 2013
Cloud Atlas," Magnificent performances in a unique cinematic event.
","This is a remarkable movie that is completely actor driven. This movie showcases the talents of all the principal performers. Each one plays multiple roles, some cross-racial, others cross-gender. Their performances are uniformly great. This has to be Tom Hanks' best movie in years, and the same goes for Halle Berry. The story itself is unique and complex, which is both good and not so good. Good because it tries to show the interconnectedness of human beings that transcends time; not so good because in trying to tell such a story, it seems to bite off more than it can chew, meaning that the story after awhile becomes a little mushy. Nevertheless, that's a minor drawback that does not in any way detract from the magnificent performances of the actors throughout the film. To me, a story should have a tight structure; in this movie the producers have opted for a broader approach, which though impressive never quite achieves the level of spectacular. The reason for that is not because of the story itself but because of the structure of the film which is rife with parallel editing which does not quite succeed in keeping the story on track. Hence the storyline unravels. But with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry each doing six rolls, one still leaves the theatre with a feeling that this movie is a unique cinematic event.",8,15,26,10 November 2012

What the Spartans did was remarkable, their sacrifice profound and their legacy not forgotten. Bravo for this movie, an outstanding cinematic accomplishment.The Battle of Thermopylae is one of the major events in European history and the victory of the Greeks over the Persians was a truly momentous event, not only for Greece but for world history. The movie is about heroism, determination, and sacrifice. Ancient Greece is associated with the glory of Athen, with its Parthenon, and great political and cultural leaders, such as Pericles, but Sparta had its moments too and this movie is about one of those moments.",8,5,10,30 March 2007
The Hangover Part III," Funny sequel to parts 1 and 2.
","If you want to watch a movie that generates almost nonstop laughter, this is the movie for you. Although this is the third installment of the wolf pack, featuring the usual cast of characters, this movie actually is more about one of the characters, Doug, and his strange and highly amusing relationship with Mr. Chow, who is one of the funniest characters in movies today. Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms are wonderful, but they serve as straight men as Doug and Chow deliver all the funny lines. Ken Cheong is outstanding as Mr. Chow, but it is Zach Galifianakis who carries this movie. What a great comedic actor. Many of his lines generate immediate laughter and since he has most of the gunny lines, there's lot so laughter. Some of the humor is low brow, but so what? It's a comedy. And the presence of Melissa McCarthy makes this movie even more hilarious. A she-wolf may be joining the group.",Null,0,1,1 June 2013
Apollo 13," Good movie.
","Apollo 13 is a good movie. It's well acted, offers a compelling story, and dramatizes how team work can achieve positive results. The problem with this movie, however, is that we know what happened. Apollo 13 was not an obscure historical event nor did the participants disappear into the pages of history. Hence the movie does not offer any surprises. After the several disasters associated with space exploration, it is obvious that space travel is extremely risky, still experimental and not to be taken for granted. If Hollywood insists on making movies about space exploration, however, then why not make a movie about one of the spectacular successes, like Apollo 11, or the dramatic events surrounding the flight of Alan B. Shephard in May 1961?",7,0,2,6 January 2006
Fast Five," Let us pay homage to all the automobiles that were sacrificed in the making of this movie.
","One thing about this movie becomes immediately apparent: its fixation on the automobile. This is a movie that goes through automobiles like a glutton consumes food. The wreckage and carnage is nonstop. This movie is a junkyard dealer's dream. This movie may set a record for the most automobiles demolished in one movie. In this movie, automobiles are crashed, smashed, dismantled, reassembled, assessed, analyzed,and discussed. In this movie, automobiles are more than just props, they are characters too who are sacrificed to achieve a greater good, which is to tell a story. When an automobile blows up one can almost imagine that poor hunk of metal grimacing in its final death throes, as the humans fight on. Almost all the action centers around automobiles, flashy automobiles, as well as their cousins, the armored cars, trucks, and vans. In this movie, if an object has an engine and wheels it is vulnerable to destruction by fire, blunt force or explosion, or a combination of all three. In this movie automobiles are put through their paces. This movie shows that when an automobile traveling at an extremely high speed makes contact with some other heavy object, the results can be spectacular, and in this movie it is proved time and time again. All this being the case, this has to be one of the best action movies made in a long time. The movie brings together all the elements need to produce a credible, entertaining product. The story is innovative and original; the acting is strong; and the cinematography, including special effects, is incredible. The good guys are really good and the bad guys are really bad. Jordana Brewster is beautiful as are all the female cast, but Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson have a screen presence which carries this movie. They are an entertainment team that is unmatchable. Bringing these two superb and charismatic performers together in one movie works brilliantly. The story moves forward relentlessly, each scene crammed with action. Also, this movie contains spectacular panoramic vistas of Rio de Janeiro and the music is snappy, as is the dialog. There is quarreling, fighting, friendship, teamwork, love, loyalty, and betrayal. Dwyane Johnson is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger, except that Mr. Johnson is better. His screen presence is incredible. In addition, he can act! Congratulations to everyone involved in making this movie. It is a masterpiece. This movie is a much-watch for any action movie aficionados and for movie buffs in general consistent with the movies PG-13 rating.",10,1,5,4 May 2011
Pineapple Express," Where's the humor?
","With the exception of an automobile chase scene this movie offers nothing that is particularly funny. The movie's preoccupation of with drug abuse and it's treatment of various subjects, including drug dealing, gang violence, police corruption, corrupting the morals of a minor, are not funny. They are subjects that do not inspire humor. Two guys behaving stupidly can be funny. Anyone ever heard of Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello? And what about the two guys in Clerks II? And what the two guys in Sideways? Or in Weekend at Bernie's? Great movies and fun too. But this movie just doesn't do it. Drug dealing and drug using dudes just does not provoke laughter. There is nothing funny about that, not even as a goof. The acting is good with James Franco giving an impressive performance in a challenging role. Substance abuse is a serious problem which destroys people. If you find humor in drug trafficking and police corruption then this movie is for you. Otherwise, if you want some laughs, go rent Get Smart.",4,4,12,2 September 2008
Spectre," Entertaining but don't expect anything new.
","The problem with this movie was the story. It is so contrived that it negates the strong acting. The prologue was good and the final scene strong, but everything in between was filler. This James Bond film offers nothing new. Instead it is a potboiler out the same creative mold that produced so many other Bond movies before it. The supporting cast was excellent. Unfortunately, their characters were not given more screen time. David Bautista was surprisingly excellent, Monica Bellucci was beautiful, and Christoph Waltz was, as usual, outstanding as the main bad guy. The James Bond formula seems to be wearing thin. It's been done so often that there isn't much left. Daniel Craig is great as Bond, but he's at least the fifth actor to play the role. Yet the movie also has its strong points: beautiful cinematography, excellent special effects, exciting action scenes, and, as mentioned before, a strong finish. So, the movie is watchable and will entertain. Just don't expect anything new.",7,1,3,12 December 2015
Joy," People are greedy and not nice. What else is new?
","Money corrupts. Not an original theme, yet this is what this movie is about. It lambasts most, if not all, of the major social institutions of modern society. Marriage, commerce, the mass media, work, the law - all are targeted for negative treatment. The problem is that none of this is surprising, new or insightful. Essentially, the movie is a soap opera, and not very good one. All the characters are flawed. Most remarkable is their intellectual shallowness equaled only by their selfishness and greed. The principal character, a woman named Joy, invents something and then immediately encounters difficulties trying to market it. She depends on others who repeatedly let her down. Finally, after repeatedly being ripped off, the light goes on inside her head. She finally realizes that people are not nice. Once she understands that, she becomes a success. Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper deliver strong performances. Robert DeNiro is okay as Joy's stupid father. However, this is not one of DeNiro's better performances. DeNiro tries to give his character some depth, but he fails because his character is simply too intellectually limited.",2,17,38,28 January 2016
Her," A unique love affair.
","This movie is not as far-fetched as it may seem. In fact, the story is entirely plausible. A man develops a relationship with a computer program which has been designed specifically for that purpose. That the computer is a machine and the program a contrivance becomes less important than how the program is successful in helping the man gratify his emotional needs. The program helps him come out of his emotional shell and honestly confront his feelings. This is no different than a person projecting their emotional needs onto a pet or some inanimate object and then believing that they have an actual relationship with that object. A person may say that they love an automobile, or a fish, and mean it, even if cognitively they realize that these objects are not human. Joaquin Phoenix gives a masterful performance as Theodore, the man who engages with the computer program. His performance is strong yet subtle, and he succeeds in carrying this movie.",10,0,1,18 February 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Has its flaws but nevertheless a very good movie.
","It must be admitted that this is a very good movie. Expecting to find an overrated, over-hyped piece of Hollywood bluster, instead this movie was riveting, evocative, well acted and upbeat. What a relief because whereas usually their is an inverse relationship between hype and artistic quality, here the relation is direct ... for once. The movie deals with a number of themes, poverty, love, crime, child abuse, and has a number of plots which are all woven together to produce a coherent and watchable work of art that restores confidence in the artistic credibility of commercial cinema. Most compelling was the effective use of flashbacks and the portrayal of the main characters as the audience observes their development. Although a high quality movie, it does have its faults. First, there is the scene where Hindus attack Moslems. This scene is entirely outside of the context of the story, more so since religion does not define the characters. Second, the child actors playing the older brother simply were not menacing looking enough to make their performances entirely believable. Third, the Taj Mahal scenes where the audience is supposed to believe in young kids passing themselves off as tourist guides was ludicrous. Fourth, how the main character manages to get onto the game show is not clearly explained. Fifth, by the end of the movie a huge slum had been cleared away with no explanation other than ... 'we used to live there.' Sixth, the questions on the game show were challenging but, considering the sum of money at stake, not overly difficult. Seventh, the use of torture to extract a confession was completely inconsistent with the nature of the alleged crime - cheating on a game show. The show could have told the young man to leave. Yet, despite all these shortcomings, the movie was entertaining, compelling, well acted and deserves praise.",8,1,3,3 March 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," Heroism in a sordid world.
","The first half of this movie was almost entirely dominated by special effects which obscured the story. The second half was much more intense, as the relationship between Max and Furiosa developed. Charlize Theron was marvelous as Furiosa. Her character is the most developed and the one with whom the audience could empathize. The same could not be said for Max. He is a wanderer; we know little else about him. The world is harsh, and Max is a battered wreck who is barely surviving. Furiosa is also battered, but she is beautiful, as well as heroic and idealistic. She is willing to risk her life for others in a world where the value of human life is zero. Max also is heroic, but yet is still a wanderer. The post-apocalyptic world is presented starkly. It is a wasteland where resources are scare and whoever controls the resources has power. There is a dictator who reigns through terror and controls the resources. He is the bad guy. But is Max a good guy? The cast is excellent; their performances are powerful. Although this movie is science fiction, its premise, that civilization can collapse, is not without plausibility. Tom Hardy performs excellently as Max. Although brutalized, Max maintains his dignity. The question is whether he and Furiosa and trust each other. To find out what happens, watch the movie.",9,2,18,4 June 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," The making of a hero.
","Desmond Doss is a hero. In the middle of total carnage he is out there saving lives. This should serve as the basis for a great movie. This movie comes close to being just that, a great movie, but just misses the mark. It has lots of action and excellent acting set in a time and place that is still known and remembered with reverence today. But most of all, it is about a man who stays true to his principles, and against all odds triumphs. The battle of Okinawa is depicted in all its gory violence. Soldiers on both sides are dying by the hundreds. Through it all, Desmond Doss does his duty, which, as a medic, is to save lives. Nothing stops him, not even a grenade. And if that isn't enough, he's married to a beautiful young lady who adores him and whose photograph he carries in his Bible, which she gave him as a present and which he takes into battle. To tell this story, the director Mel Gibson, pulls out the stops. It is Hollywood through and through. From the confrontation scene in the barracks, to the presence of the overbearing sergeant, to the inclusion of the devoted girlfriend, the hero perseveres and finally proves himself on the battlefield, proving all his detractors wrong. If someone wants to watch a movie about a hero, this is the movie to watch.",9,6,9,28 July 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," Hero without a gun.
","This is a good movie. A conscientious objector wins the Medal of Honor. Shows that one need not use a weapon to be a hero. It also shows the fanaticism of the Japanese troops who had zero chance of winning, yet would rather die than surrender. The movie would have been stronger if it had provided more historical context to the story. For instance, why the US found it necessary to invade Okinawa and why the Japanese fought fanatically to defend it. The movie presumes that the audience knows the history of the US-Japanese war in the Pacific. It also does not provide more depth into the characters and personalities of the Japanese soldiers who, without exception, are ALL depicted as mad, blood thirsty maniacs. Nevertheless, the movie succeeds in telling a story of one man who stayed true to his principles and emerged a hero.",9,1,2,15 April 2019
Gladiator," There are not enough superlatives to describe this movie.
","Some movies are made to be watched over and over again, that's how good they are. Gladiator is one of those movies. It has all the elements that makes for a good movie. There is a compelling story, an altruistic hero, a sinister villain, a damsel and her young son, excellent musical score, great cinematography, great support cast, strong dialog and a solid finale. The movie has become a Hollywood icon. Its characters have achieved legendary status. Jaoquin Phoenix is superb as the Emperor Commodus, who is reviled by everyone, including his own sister. (Yet this does not stop the indefatigable emperor from doing his paperwork.) Russell Crowe gives a tour-de-force performance as Maximus, the hero general who refuses to cave in to the vindicative and jealous emperor. Oliver Reed, in his final performance, is great as Maximus's friend and ally. The scenes in the Colosseum are spectacular; the Colosseum itself is shown in all of its grandeur, a fitting venue for the kinds of spectacles that became symbols of Roman decadence and cruelty. All in all, this is a wonderful movie, one that deservedly is a classic.The part of the movie where Maximus reveals himself to the emperor is one of the greatest scenes in the history of Hollywood cinema. This is the scene that every director strives for, dreams about and rarely attains. Ridley Scott must have felt great to have put together such a stunning and evocative scene. The corrupt emperor and his erstwhile general, facing off, in front of the crowd, witnessed by the Senate, and the emperor's sister, indeed, by the entire world. Wow! Now THAT'S entertainment!",10,2,5,3 October 2010
Contact," The Hula Hoops movie
","This is the movie with the hula hoops. If you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean. The movie has an interesting premise and Jodie Foster is as usual excellent as a scientist who wants to prove that she has made contact with extraterrestrials, but the story itself is almost laughable and even allowing for literary license, which in this movie runs wild, renders the movie ultimately mediocre. The movie wants the audience to accept certain premises that so defy the laws of physics that when Ms. Foster's character is challenged as to the credibility of her findings, well, frankly, she fails so completely to make a case that the movie became pointless. One other thing, the movie portrays the construction of a contraption for space travel that resembles two huge hula hoops. Hence, I nickname this movie the Hula Hoops movie.",6,2,5,3 April 2007
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," In this case, the format works.
","Amazingly, this is a good, robust movie. Despite the heavy reliance on special effects, the movie actually has a coherent story in which human characters figure prominently. Some of the dialog is snappy and the movie keeps the audience engaged. The principle characters are interesting and are not lost in all the noise and mayhem caused by the robots. The robots, both good and bad, are actually interesting, with humanoid features that make their behavior more plausible. One can almost feel sorry or elated when a robot is destroyed. John Malkovich and John Tuturro are especially excellent and the rest of cast give energetic performances. One is almost rooting for the good guys to win. Heroism abounds as the robots and humans join together to fight for the survival of the planet. They form a united front which transcends the obvious chasm that separates human from machine. Leonard Nimoy's voice-over work is excellent. This movie is one of the better examples of the sci-fi, action, fantasy genre. In this case, the format works.",8,7,16,30 June 2011
The Social Network," Once we built things, now we build websites.
","As further evidence of the decadence of modern society, this movie fits the bill. In the nineteenth century the electric light replaced the candle; the telephone replaced the telegraph. These were two landmark inventions that changed the world for the better and marked new developments in technology that benefited all of mankind. Then in the twentieth century came the airplane and penicillin, two more inventions that changed the world forever. Then in 2003 came ... Facebook! Wow! According to the movie, this cyber-network was launched by an angry computer geek who stole the idea from three snobs at Harvard who in turn were determined to make the geek pay for his thievery. The story seems shallow but is actually a compelling and fascinating as the movie shows how one person became the center of a whirlwind over something that is little more than a toy. Unlike the financial barons of the past, who dealt with railroads, steel mills, coal mines and oil refineries, our modern day billion-dollar entrepreneurs are computer-savvy operatives who create web networks. It's not exactly building a factory or creating anything actually new. There are no new technological breakthroughs, nothing that improves the condition of the human race. Rather, these new 'captains of industry' are creating playthings, gimmicks, facilitating a service that is intangible, that people cannot consume but meets a need to feel connected in a world in which one can feel very alone. Jessie Eisenberg gives an incredible performance as the main character in this movie. He projects the main character's personal shallowness, intellectual narrowness, mental disturbance, sociopathic inclinations and essential nastiness. Whether this unflattering portrayal is a true depiction of the actual founder of Facebook is another question, but if it is, then he has serious problems. In the nineteenth century the United States built the transcontinental railroad; in the twentieth century discovered atomic power and placed men on the moon; and now in the twenty-first century there is a program that allows millions of people to communicate by computer. Wow! Better get yourself a pc so you can get online and start communicating with all your friends and neighbors and employees and fellow human beings, and maybe even with aliens from outer space if you believe in that. Oops! You're not computer literate? No problem! Leave it to a 'computer-savvy' college student to invent a computer program designed specifically for the computer illiterate, THEN build a website, and then let the whole world know that now EVERYONE, even the most staunchly computer illiterate, can now communicate by pc, for a price. But if somebody does invent such a program and launches such a website, remember: IT WAS MY IDEA!!! and if you steal it I will sue ... and I won't go complaining to the college president first.",9,4,10,2 October 2010
The Great Gatsby," Out of control materialism.
","This movie features one of the most atrocious beginnings of a major motion picture in recent years. Instead of starting off on an intimate note and then building up to a climactic conclusion, the movie opens with a man in a mental hospital trying to tell a story and then cutting to scenes of seemingly nonstop raucous partying, throwing at the audience an almost endless barrage of noise which completely distracts from the narrator's attempt to engage the audience and causes one to ask: 'When will this stop?' This mistake is magnified by the injection of hip-hop music which not only is inconsistent with the historical period of the story, the 1920s, but which is completely discordant for a character like Gatsby, for whom trumpets and flourishes befitting royalty would have been far more appropriate. In short, the movie uses the wrong kind of music as a build up to Gatsby's entrance, which not unexpectedly falls flat. Yet, the movie recovers. This movie is about the flaunting of wealth and the emptiness of life in a society in which materialism is worshiped as a god. This theme is driven home through the character of J. Gatsby. Gatsby, who was born poor, believes that his self-worth is based upon the amount of wealth that he can accumulate, and that without wealth, he is not worthy of love. Yet, Gatsby is no mere caricature of a rich man wallowing in wealth; just the opposite is the case. Personally, he is handsome, debonair, charming, intelligent, cheerful, friendly, supportive, generous, and courageous. But it is all a façade concealing a checkered past. Taking his cues from a culture which places materialism and accumulation above all else, he too must accumulate his money and things and engage in ostentatious displays of wealth, not for his personal enjoyment, for he is fundamentally indifferent to all his props, but to show that he is somebody of worth. 'Judge me not by who I am but by what I have.' As a result, his life is empty, all by his own doing. When Gatsby is confronted with the fact of his own deceitfulness, he falls apart, and that is his undoing. From that moment he starts spiraling downward to his doom. Gatsby cannot accept the fact that all that he has acquired means nothing, because if his wealth means nothing, then he is nothing. The first half-hour or so of this movie excepted, this movie is an excellent drama featuring strong and evocative performances, led by Leonardo Di Caprio, who, once again, proves that he is one of the premier principal actors in Hollywood today. Carey Mulligan is also outstanding as Daisy, who is Gatsby's love interest. However, the strongest performance is that of Joel Edgerton's, which attains a level of power worthy of an Academy Award nomination. All in all, this movie is a credible interpretation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel and should be watched by all who value high quality drama and movies.",8,1,3,22 May 2013
Sully," The quintessential hero.
","This is a great movie. It's about a regular working-class guy who does something heroic. The movie is also about New York City. It showcases New York City at its best. Sully is the kind of movie that is so good that it can't help but put you in a good mood, and make you believe that decent, caring people are still out there. A pilot is flying a plane and when confronted with impending disaster maintains his self-control resulting in a lot of lives being saved. Yet, what makes the movie even more enjoyable are the qualities of the hero himself - modest, caring, loyal, and professional. The movie manages to make you care about him as a person and in the process come to appreciate who he is and what he did. Tom Hanks warrants accolades for his fine performance has Chessley Sullenberger. The rest of the cast is excellent too. But as the title indicates, the story centers around one man who showed the world true heroism in the fullest sense of the world.",10,0,3,12 September 2016
Cinderella Man," A Jewish boxer portrayed as a villain? NO WAY! What about Benny Leonard?
","A movie about James Braddock? Why not? He seemed like a good man, the salt of the earth, who overcomes all kinds of adversity to become the heavyweight champion. Not a bad story at all ... but so what? But if Hollywood is going to make a movie about boxing champions, how about making a movie about the life and career of Benny Leonard, arguably the greatest lightweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Carlos Monzon, arguably the greatest middleweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Barney Ross, who was world champion in three different weight classes and war hero? In fact, what about a movie about the life and times of Max Baer, who is portrayed as the 'bad guy' in the movie, and who, by the way, wore the Star of David on his trunks, so how bad could he be? In fact, if Baer was such a bad guy, how could he have been the father of Max Baer, Jr. who played Jethro Bodine on 'The Beverly Hillbillies'? Any man who was the father of the actor who played Jethro Bodine could not have been all that bad of a guy. Max Baer was a boxer, boxing is a violent sport and naturally, and unfortunately, the contestants do get hurt or worse. But to imply that Max Baer was gratuitously violent is unfair, even for a movie. So, if you want to watch a movie about James Braddock, then this is probably the movie to watch, but don't come away thinking badly about Max Baer. Remember, if it wasn't for Max Baer, there may never have been a Jethro Bodine.",4,3,5,30 July 2005
Jurassic Park," Science+Profit = Trouble
","When I first watched this movie years ago, I didn't like it. I thought the movie was one big special-effects extravaganza with theatrical and uninspiring acting (except, of course, in the scene with the lawyer sitting on the toilet who's gobbled up by an out-of-control and hungry Tyrannosaurus Rex. I don't know if that scene was meant to be funny, but I recall that it provoked a certain amount of laughter.) Subsequently, I didn't give this movie a second thought. Then recently I happened to be watching television and lo-and-behold I switched to a channel that just happened to be showing Jurassic Park. So I watched the movie and this time I liked it. Indeed I thought this movie was great, and I'll tell you why. Despite the overblown special effects and contrived script and the almost laughable acting, especially by 'Newman' from Jerry Seinfeld in one of the worst cases of miscasting in the history of movie making, this movie successfully and effectively deals with a serious theme - what happens when highly sensitive, highly experimental and potentially lethal scientific knowledge and technology gets into the hands of people who want to exploit this knowledge and technology for profit. This movie shows how the technology of cloning, when used irresponsibly and with little of any thought for possible consequences, can produce disastrous results, in this case, dinosaurs running amok with no way to control them. It seems far-fetched, but really no more so than the possibility of people being able to fly or communicate electronically over huge distances. It only seems far-fetched until it becomes a reality and then it's like it was always meant to be. But getting back to this movie, now that the dinosaurs are unleashed, the question is: how can they be controlled? They were supposed to be placed on display in a park, but it doesn't quite work out the way it was intended. Instead of the dinosaurs being confined, they literally go on a rampage, completely trash the park and in the process reveal a level of intelligence and cunning that is entirely unexpected, with dire consequences. The raptors, for instance, are not mere reptilian brutes but rather are cunning and highly intelligent creatures which makes them even more dangerous. And the humans who unleashed these creatures are simply no match for the ferociousness and strength of creatures that are now beyond all control. Compared to the dinosaurs the humans puny and helpless bystanders who are literally running for their lives when not caught and devoured. The humans' weapons are absolutely no match for the ferociousness of these creatures, who easily overpower and out-think the humans. The movie ends with the surviving humans getting out while they can, leaving the dinosaurs in charge of the park. Now, what happens if the dinosaurs escape from the park? Could the human species survive?In a way, this movie is akin to the stories 'Frankenstein', 'The Invisible Man' and 'Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' which also deal with issues relating to consequences of irresponsible scientific research.",10,3,4,13 November 2005
Valkyrie," Tom Cruise gives a strong and dignified performance.
","A prudent movie goer approaches with caution any commercial movie that purports to be based on an actual historical event. Usually by the time the movie is released the facts are so distorted as to render the actual event almost unrecognizable. Surprisingly this movie is an exception. Although the actual assassination attempt on Hitler failed, this movie succeeds in establishing and maintaining the level of suspense required to keep the audience engaged. Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly strong and dignified performance as the German officer who plays a crucial role in planning and implementing the plot. The supporting cast, which includes several outstanding English actors including Terence Stamp who plays an uncharacteristically sympathetic role, are also excellent. What makes this movie especially effective is that it avoids stereotyping the Germans as a bunch of goose-stepping Nazis or in the case of the assassins a bunch of frantic anti-Nazi fanatics and instead stays true to the story which involves a group of individuals trying to stop a war against all odds. That they fail is not the point because the audience already knows that. Rather, that they were willing to take action at all is what makes this movie a special cinematic experience.Another interesting feature of this movie is its treatment of how the German soldiers, including the plotters, dealt with the loyalty oath that every German soldier swore to Adolf Hitler. This meant that the mere thought of opposing Hitler was tantamount not only to committing treason but acting with dishonor which would cause that soldier to be held in utmost contempt by his fellow soldiers, a disgrace that few soldiers could endure. (Of course, when one considers who the German soldiers were fighting for and the crimes many of them committed in the name of their leader, one must question the extent to which ethical considerations played a role in anything the German soldiers did.)Now here's the negatives about this movie. What is especially ironic is that while the Germans were invading countries, committing genocide and killing people by the millions, they could not assassinate one person. The Germans were systematically murdering Jews - they had no qualms about THAT - but apparently killing the Fuehrer was another story. Remember, the plotters were senior military officers, not unarmed civilians, who had access to all the weapons they needed to to the job. Yes, the Germans were very 'brave' when fighting unarmed Jews but when it came to dealing with their Fuehrer, the person to whom they voluntarily swore allegiance, then their bravery failed them. Where was the opposition on September 1, 1939 (when Germany invaded Poland)? Or on June 21, 1941 (when Germany invaded the Soviet Union)? May 29, 1942 (when the British obliterated Cologne)? Or on January 30, 1943 (when the Soviet Union captured the German 6th Army at Stalingrad)? This doesn't make the assassination attempt any less significant but it should be placed within an historical context. History records that Adolf Hitler was adored ... indeed loved ... by the German people, a fact that the German people will have to deal with for a long time to come. Germans opposed Adolf Hitler? So what? Too little, too late. And who were they to repudiate their oath of allegiance? Guided by a misplaced sense of honor, they chose to follow the Fuehrer, so they had no cause to complain. The Fuehrer had not duped them, they had duped themselves. This movie teaches that one should take great care to whom to swear allegiance. The same officers who plotted against Hitler also participated in aggressive war which set the stage for genocide. That they had second thoughts about the direction the war was going is commendable but it does not absolve them of their own complicity in implementing Hitler's policies.",8,15,27,25 December 2008
Draft Day," Good movie, with flaws.
","There are some holes in the story, such as the owner, Molina, being able to travel almost instantaneously hundreds of miles, and having an unexplained change of mind regarding Weaver's moves, but all in all, this is a good movie. Kevin Costner gives an excellent performance as a football general manager who has to weigh loyalty versus expediency as he tries to put together a winning team. The movie does a good job in conveying the sense of pressure as teams compete with each other to parley draft picks. The movie shows how a mere rumor can effect the draft, and the critical role of the general manager in trying to separate fiction from fact when determining who to select. The movie also does a good job in dramatizing what happens when confidence in the general manager erodes. The movie shows the general manager, Weaver, making some really questionable moves, such as trading away THREE future number one draft picks for a number one draft pick that the GM has not fully vetted. Also, other stuff that's pure Hollywood is the quarterback trashing the GM's office (never would happen), one GM calling another GM an expletive, the GM's mother berating her son while he's deal making, the head coach negotiating behind the GM's back, and the GM having a sexual relationship with the team's financial officer (who just so happens to be a young and attractive lady). Nevertheless, the movie's basic story line, a general manager operating under pressure to make decisions that effects an entire football team, remains intact. For that reason, this is a movie that is worth watching. Just remember, however, that this movie is fiction.",7,0,0,30 September 2017
The Wizard of Oz," It's Not a Children's Story
","An interesting treatment of the human unconscious can be found in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz directed by Victor Fleming and featuring Judy Garland, Margaret Hamilton, Billie Burke and Frank Morgan. A young adolescent girl, Dorothy, living with her aunt and uncle on a farm in Kansas, is threatened with the loss of her dog, Toto, who is not only her pet but her best friend, confidante and closest companion. Powerless to prevent Toto from being removed from the home (Toto had bitten Ms. Gulch, the town sour puss), Dorothy runs away from home, taking Toto with her. On the road she encounters a kindly traveling salesman who through clever trickery convinces the highly suggestible girl that she must return home at once. Now alarmed, Dorothy rushes back to her home but on the way a tornado is fast approaching the farm. When she finally arrives home, the family has taken refuge in the cellar and cannot hear Dorothy's frantic banging on the cellar door. Now terrified, Dorothy and Toto rush into the house which is shaking violently from the tornado which is now directly over the house. Dorothy is struck on the head by flying debris and is knocked unconscious. She awakes to find herself in a strange new land called Oz where she meets many interesting characters and experiences many adventures as she struggles to find her way back home. She is told by the good witch of the north that she has to follow the yellow brick road. While traveling on the yellow brick road Dorothy's fortitude is repeatedly tested as she fends herself, Toto and her friends against the wicked witch of the west, a violent and malevolent figure who blames Dorothy for the death of her sister, the wicked witch of the east, and has vowed revenge. Finally, after finding the Wizard of Oz, who is revealed to be a fraud, Dorothy is preparing to leave the land of Oz by floating back to Kansas in a balloon. But her plan goes awry when Toto jumps from the balloon and Dorothy follows leaving her stranded as the balloon floats away; at this point she awakes and is disoriented, adamantly insisting to her family and farm hands, who are standing around her, that her dream was real. Dorothy however has changed. At the start of the movie, she is behaving like a frightened little girl, whining and cranky, but after she awakes she has matured and is now aware of the power and strength that was buried deep inside her unconscious and which surfaced in the dream and is now part of her consciousness. Besides presenting a unique and provocative story, what makes this movie particularly effective as a work of art is the strong acting, especially that of Margaret Hamilton whose portrayal of the wicked witch of the west, with her loud, cackling laugh, ugly, distorted sneer, and greenish skin, is the epitome of evil. Far from being campy, this movie explores several psychological themes, including consciousness vs. unconsciousness, developmental issues, inter-familial dynamics, the nature of dreams, and behavioral issues, and highlights virtues such as courage, fortitude and loyalty, delves into the nature of conflict, the nature of terror, provides a credible portrayal of separation anxiety, and explores gender roles and death. Further, a particularly intriguing feature of this movie is that both the protagonist (Dorothy) and antagonist (the wicked witch of the west) are strong female figures locked in a life or death struggle in a hostile, unfamiliar environment. Indeed, the wicked witch of the west directly commands an army while Dorothy directly commands three male figures, including a lion and later the wizard of oz himself. The male characters are portrayed as being dependent, indecisive, vulnerable and subordinate to the females who dominate all facets of the story. And what makes this movie even more impressive is that it was produced not by mental health experts but by a Hollywood studio wanting to create a commercial product based on a book for children written by a journalist. The movie also features several songs that have become iconic fixtures in contemporary western culture and still attracts a large audience, seventy one years after its initial release. The Wizard of Oz may be the most-watched movie in history.Don't let the title fool you. It's not a children's story. Rather it's a complex tale involving a confused and rebellious teenage girl who runs away from home, is knocked unconscious in a storm and has a dream that is essentially one long nightmare, as the terrified girl desperately seeks a way to return home, a home that she had forsaken. In her nightmare/dream she meets many bizarre characters, all of whom are caricatures of people she knows in her real life, and these characters are strange and scary, especially the wicked witch who absolutely loathes the girl, who has no one to protect her except three companions whose inadequacies are a central feature of the story. In fact, the girl would have done better to have avoided these characters -the lion who is a coward, the rusty tin man with no heart, and the scarecrow with nothing but hay inside him - but then there would not have been a movie. The music is catchy, and Judy Garland's rendition of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' is truly classic, and the color cinematography is great, so I definitely recommend it. But this movie could frighten young children who do not understand the complexities of the story and characters, and could frighten adults as well, especially those adults who are afraid of screaming green skinned women who fly around on broom sticks and melt when they are doused by a bucket of water.",10,2,4,10 October 2005

","This movie opens with a group of persons in space suits collecting rocks in desert-like terrain that purportedly is Mars. Apparently this is a scientific mission. Then a hurricane like wind storm blows and the mission has to be aborted, quickly. One of the crew is struck with flying debris and is left behind. He is presumed (erroneously and without confirmation) to have died. The crew member's death is reported to NASA, which is in charge of the mission. NASA accepts the report as final and announces that the crew member had died. The crew member is given an elaborate funeral. Then, by sheer accident, a NASA technician monitoring a satellite orbiting Mars discovers that the crew member is alive and is actually moving about on the surface. What is NASA supposed to do? Attempt a recovery which could put the rest of crew at risk? A NASA mission has left one of their own on Mars to die. He was abandoned. The moral, legal and political implications are obvious. This build up offers almost unlimited dramatic potential. At this point the movie tanks, badly. Instead of tapping into the dramatic potential to further increase the tension, the movie becomes formalistic, predictable and boring. The abandoned crew man remains affable, still a team player. That he was left behind by his comrades as dead generates at most slight annoyance. Instead of being overwhelmed with despair and engulfed by terror, which would have been exceedingly dramatic, he is listening to disco music, and, even more amazingly, growing food under conditions that defy all known science. Much of this is amusing, but only because it is so unrealistic and contrived as to generate unintended laughter. On earth the NASA administrator, played by Jeff Daniels who gives the only solid performance in the movie (which is why the movie is rated a 2 instead of 'awful'), does not want to order a rescue mission. Thus he becomes the 'heavy' or the 'bad guy' when actually the real 'bad guy' is the commander of the mission who stupidly, and without any corroborating evidence, presumes that her crew member was killed and instead of telling the truth, that the crew member was missing, then compounds the lie and the political fallout by passing it on to her superiors who later are forced to eat their words when the truth finally emerges. Such a scenario, if depicted with sufficient dramatic power, would have been a pivotal point in the story. Instead, the commander's poor judgment is never fully explained, her irresponsibility and lack of common sense glossed over. True, the commander is shown having pangs of guilt, but she remains quiet until such time that she is informed of her error, which by that point is anticlimactic. Then the rest of the movie is about her wanting to go back to Mars to save her crew man, the same man she abandoned. Ridiculous. She goofed, big time, and nobody demands that she account for her decision, not the one to leave a crew member behind, but to officially report him as dead. From that point on, the story devolves into just another formalistic potboiler with lots of overblown special effects that do nothing to make up for the huge holes in the plot, the inane dialogue, the wholesale jettisoning of scientific plausibility (Growing potatoes on Mars? Hurricane force winds on a planet with an atmosphere that is practically a vacuum? Terrain that looks surprisingly like Monument Valley? De-compressing an entire space craft without it completely crumbling? The crewman not bleeding to death after being impaled in the abdomen by a long sharp piece of metal?) or the spotty acting. As for the last item, sometimes a great actor can take mediocre material and raise it to a higher artistic level. Suffice it to say, in this movie that does not happen. Damon cannot save this movie nor does he seem to make an effort to try. No great dramatic scenes. No sense of crisis. No recriminations. No nothing.",2,10,33,6 October 2015
The Fighter," Two brothers; both champions.
","What a great movie! The movie starts rather unspectacularly but soon builds into a strong, compelling dramatic story about two incredibly strong characters, one of whom is sick, who stick with each other and help each other overcome their personal obstacles. Mark Wahlberg and Melissa Leo are outstanding, but the this movie is a showcase for Christiam Bale whose performance is remarkable bordering on incredible. Mr. Bale portrays a character who by any reasonable standard should be detested yet by the end of movie is worthy of admiration. The movie also provides a candid and powerful portrayal of the dysfunctional family and how the fighter copes with these issues to achieve success. For the fighter is not a wanton punching machine. He actually cares and the movie shows it. One is fascinated by the nature of the family dynamics and how they effect the main characters. Instead of being corny or contrived, the story is presented in a straightforward manner that lays out the issues. The character of Mickey Ward is heroic, that of his brother sublime. Both deserve respect, both became champions, one in the ring, the other in life.",10,0,2,2 January 2011
Up in the Air," Good and not so good.
","How does one go about firing someone? What is the best way to get rid of a worker? These questions are the basis of this movie which highlights the precarious nature of our existence. George Clooney gives a strong and convincing performance as man who lives his life according to certain principles and when he abandons his own principles winds up paying the price. This movie is rather offbeat and in some ways reminds one of the kind of movies made by John Cassavetes, with his semi-documentary style that emphasized reality over conventional story telling. For this movie is based on a theme that we can all relate to, namely the unpredictability of life. Whether this movie succeeds as an entertainment piece is questionable, but as a social commentary, it does have merit.There is a saying which goes something like this: know your limits. This movie completely ignores that maxim and the results are, not unexpectedly, a poorly crafted movie. While an attempt to explore the human condition is a commendable project, it may be asking a bit much for a Hollywood production company to do the job. Let's face it, Hollywood is good for churning out assembly line fluff but please, don't ask it to get into something as deep, serious and profoundly puzzling as the meaning of life itself. That is just being unrealistic, yet this movie, this Hollywood production, attempts just that, and not only does a poor job of it, but makes their effort even more embarrassing by trying to make light of the subject. You have a guy who basically lives in hotels and travels around the country doing corporate dirty work and we're supposed to expect that he has something serious to say? That he knows something that we don't already know? Yeah ... right. The theme of the rootless man was already treated in the movie Trains, Planes and Automobiles with far better results because whereas this movie is heavy handed and flat, at least John Candy and Steve Martin brought some comic relief to an otherwise droll topic. George Clooney is an excellent actor for certain roles but he's no John Candy so don't expect the laughs that Mr. Candy would have elicited playing the exact same role. His acting is wooden, his demeanor flat, his persona null. It has to be his worst performance. There was a time when Hollywood had the creative capability to produce credible cinematic works that explore various aspects of the human condition but those days are gone, a relic of history, replaced by glossy special effects extravaganzas and dominated by the stunt men who are now the real stars. Let Hollywood do what it's good at and leave it to others to create more substantive work. After all, it's only a movie.",6,9,19,22 December 2009
From Here to Eternity," Maybe Donna Reed's Best Movie
","'From Here To Eternity' takes place right before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Thus, it's really not a war movie. Actually its more of a soap opera with Burt Lancaster putting the make on Deborah Kerr and Frank Sinatra having a fight with Ernest Borgnine and Montgomery Clift having a tryst with Donna Reed, which brings me to the element of the movie that I really liked: Donna Reed's character. In the movie Donna Reed plays a prostitute who wants to earn enough money to go home, but by the end of the movie circumstances have transformed her from cynical prostitute to fiancé and bereaved victim who has lost her man, and for whom things would never be the same. To me, this is what a good movie is all about - powerful and compelling character development within the context of a story that is credible and makes sense.",10,34,42,31 July 2005
Atonement," Commendable movie.
","I don't believe it. Indeed, I'm amazed. This movie is actually good. A Hollywood romance movie that is actually watchable. Amazing. Shocking. Refreshing. I was expecting the usual Hollywood potboiler garbage - inane love story, major historical events being reduced to mere cinematic footnotes, laughable acting, ludicrous miscasting, etc. In other words, I was expecting a piece of junk, but thankfully my expectations were not met. This is a powerful movie with a compelling story and excellent acting. If I can't bring myself to rag this movie, then this movie has to be good. As a movie buff who has critiqued scores of movies, I've watched some major cinematic clunkers, stuff that doesn't even merit a DVD, cinematic flotsam that are a joke. This movie however is a work of art and warrants whatever commendations it gets from the public.",9,33,63,11 January 2008
Semi-Pro," Not that bad, but not that good either.
","Not a great movie but not that bad either, which isn't saying much because there is not much to say about this movie. It's not offensive, it has its funny moments, but it's not going to become part of the pantheon of great Hollywood classics. The best word to describe this movie is 'cute.' That's it. Nothing more. There are no memorable performances. The movie waivers between being a comedy and drama. Strong performances are nonexistent in this movie but the none of the performances were all that bad. Entertaining, yes! Inspirational? No. A masterpiece? Definitely not. One other point: this movie is supposed to be a period (1970s) but everything about the movie seems to be 2008, a discrepancy that further weakens an already teetering story.One other point. Even in a tepid movie such as this, Woody Harrelson once again gives a commendable performance, again showing that he is a great actor. If the movie was as good as his performance then this movie would have been great.",6,4,7,17 March 2008
Furious 7," Powerfully entertaining.
","This movie is excellent. Everything about this movie is entertaining. The tribute to Paul Walker is appropriate and tasteful The movie contains many humorous one-liners. Many of the actions scenes are incredible. The entire cast is excellent. Tyrese Gibson provides wonderful comic relief. Michelle Rodriguez is ... it is a virtual impossibility not to like her in this movie. Once again, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson form an action duo that, if they continue working together, should set the standard for action teams. Jason Statham plays a wonderfully entertaining bad guy. He is brutal but has style which makes him more than just another Hollywood bad guy. Actually there are many more elements of this movie worthy of praise. If you are looking for pure entertainment, this movie will fit the bill. Indeed, the movie is proof that when it wants to, Hollywood can still produce action movies that keep an audience engaged without sacrificing plot.",10,10,24,13 April 2015
The Godfather," Michael as a prince charming?
","In a class I attended in college the instructor, a learned professor of classical literature, provided what was, to me, a novel interpretation of the movie and story The Godfather. He presented the story as a fairy tale. Now, every fairy tale must have its prince charming. In the case of The Godfather the prince charming is Michael Corleone. Michael is a cold-blooded mass murderer, woman abuser and cop killer. He physically beats his second wife who is the mother of his two children, kills his brother, and kills his brother-in-law thus making his sister a widow. Even his first wife, who he loved (proof that he is not completely depraved), dies violently because of her close proximity to him. He is a harbinger of death. So how can such a reprehensible and ugly character be a prince charming? Answer: By cloaking Michael in the trappings of middle class costumes and values. Outwardly, Michael is quiet, soft-spoken, well-mannered, self-controlled, well-dressed, and well-educated. He is, outwardly, a loyal citizen, a decorated war veteran, married, a father, a brother, a property owner, a businessman, and an obedient son. He has all the trappings of respectability. That sets him apart from everyone else in the story who, with one exception, are presented as being no more than a bunch of stupid crass thugs, including his two brothers, Freddie who is dumb and Sonny, who in addition to being dumb is hot-tempered. Compared to them Michael is a paragon of virtue. That makes him seem likeable, someone worthy of empathy. The only exception to the array of unsavory figures that populate this story and interact with Michael is Michael's father, Vito Corleone, the first Godfather, whose real name is Andolini. Vito was born in a part of the world still heavily influenced by feudalistic values in which vendatta and revenge-killings were the norm. If Michael is the prince charming, then Vito is the king. Despite being a premeditated murderer himself, Vito is a 'good-guy' gangster. He resists pressure from the other gangs to get into the drug trade. A gang war ensues. Vito is shot, almost killing him. That makes Vito seem a martyr who is willing to sacrifice his life in defense of his beliefs and family. He is a king with courage and scruples. But with the king incapacitated, the survival of the family is placed at risk. Oldest son Freddie, being dumb, and second oldest son Sonny, being dead, are in no position to defend the family, leaving only Michael to take up the cause. Michael, who reveres his father, tries to conduct himself like his father, who is Michael's role model, but the norms and values that shaped his father's character are woefully out of place in the modern urban setting and applied by Michael come off as phony and contrived. As a result Michael becomes a twisted and sordid facsimile of his father. Whereas Vito was loved, admired and respected, Michael is despised, loathed and feared. Yet, he does the job of protecting the family, who are the 'good guys' in this story, and by doing so fulfills his role as the prince charming who rescues his family when everything seemed all but lost. Michael is as phony as his family's last name. His pretensions of middle class respectability are a sham. His propensity for violence is driven by a depravity so deeply rooted in his mind and spirit that it gives cause to question whether he is still capable of showing any compassion. Yet he is the modern-day prince charming who is on a mission to protect what is his, even if it no longer exists except in his mind.",10,0,0,1 October 2019
The Godfather," A study in social pathology
","A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from 'enemies' who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed 'enemies'; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star.",10,2,5,13 November 2005
