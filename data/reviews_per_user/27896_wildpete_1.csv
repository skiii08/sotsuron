The Blair Witch Project," Got into my bloodstream
","If at all possible, see this on the big screen with as few people as possible. I saw it in a packed theater, with a majority hoping for a Hollywood ending. While this movie does not make the viewer scream, there are images and sounds and inanimate objects, especially at the end, that I will not forget for a long time. I did have goosebumps on top of goosebumps several times. As the day went on, and I was able to think about it more, the more creeped out I got. I see a lot of horror movies. Jaws didn't keep me from going into the water. Psycho didn't keep me from taking a shower. Blair Witch made it very hard for me to turn off the light to go to bed. If you are able to enjoy independent movies, check it out. If you think Tom Cruise and Julia Roberts make great movies, you should probably pass. Don't go at night if you live alone.",10,1,2,31 July 1999
