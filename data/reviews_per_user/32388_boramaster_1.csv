Howl's Moving Castle," One of the best
","Whenever it is possible, get the best version of this that you can get your hands on. This, by the way, is one thing that you can have in a dubbed version that is just solid. Just take a look at the English vocalists. Astonishing. Christian Bale? Lauren Bacall? Blythe Danner? Billy Crystal, for God's sake!!??? Who knew? (Well, not me, obviously) I am not going to say a damn thing about the plot. The less you know, the better. But I will point out that the animation is very deceptive. It might look almost cheap at first. But pay attention. It will be well rewarded. Of course, once you are deep enough into it, it will gobsmack you upside the head and questions like that will melt like sugar on a hot tongue. The beauty of this whole film makes me cry.",10,0,1,29 April 2012
