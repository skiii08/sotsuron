Scarface," A extremely violent film
","A saw this film a few weeks ago and the results were violent and powerful. This film is a fictitious account of one of 250,000 Cubans who arrived in America. It even set a record for the film that had tons of 'F' words. It was about 206. Then it was surpassed by Goodfellas who had 246 and Pulp Fiction who had 257. Overall it was a good film. Al Pacino gave a over-the -top performance in this film. I thought that the most saddest scene was near the ending where Tony finds out that his friend Manny had sex with Gina and instead Tony kills Manny. Tony didn't have to do that. He could  have let his sister do anything she wants. She is not a slave. Overall it was a good film and I highly recommend it to people who love mob films.",Null,0,0,5 January 2000
The Big Lebowski," A laugh-out loud movie
","This is another funny film from the minds of the Coen Brothers. It was funny, audacious and hilarious. Despite the amount of profanity it was used in the film, it was still a funny movie. All of the cast members were great, especially John Turturro as the bowler. His two scenes really made the movie. In a way, it was sort of like the Raising Arizona of kidnapping movies. It had a surreal feel to it and that's how most of the Coen movies are. Anyway, for all you Coen lovers. They have a new film coming out and that's The Man Who Wasn't There. Anyway, The Big Lebowski: SEE IT!10 out of 10",10,0,1,23 June 2001
Full Metal Jacket," Best War Movie Ever
","I must say, this has got to be one of the best war movies that I have ever seen. The first half of the film will leave you laughing your lungs out but the second half ends up turning tragic and will leave you speechless. Stanley Kubrick is nothing but one word: genius. I mean, I love ALL of his movies. His movies are all about the dark side of human nature. Whenever you see Full Metal Jacket, it's like you are really there man. You are really in the frontlines of war. It is a shame that Stanley Kubrick has sadly passed on, but I will NEVER forget the movies that he had made. Stanley, I love you man.",Null,0,0,1 January 2001
Glory," powerful war movie
","When I first saw this movie, it really turned me on. I was almost in tears when the men had to go out to war. The movie has a feeling that makes you feel you were in the battle. I thought it was the best war movie that I have ever seen. All of the stars were excellent, especially Denzel Washington. He was superb. The thing i like about this movie was that it shows that pain the men had to go through before they had to go out for women. Part of the reason was that the commanders wanted them get ready. Also, I love the music. It creates a certain mood in every scene that the music is playing. I recommend this film highly for people who want to learn about the Civil War and family viewing. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,7 August 2000
Fargo," A comedy in a dark way.
","The first time that I saw this film is back in November of 98 on TNT. And I thought it was an outstanding film. I consider this to be the Coen Brothers best film about how a kidnapping had gone awry. It was hilarious, twisted, in other words, a must-see. This film had some very funny scenes. But it wasn't a comedy, it was a black comedy. I think that Fargo could have won for Best Picture instead of The English Patient. Sometimes the Academy Awards can be so stupid. My favorite scene in that film is when after Carl and Gaer takes Mrs. Lundegaard to their hideout place, Mrs. Lundegaard attempts to escape and when she trips, Carl says Whoops. I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it, SEE IT! A must-see.",Null,0,0,1 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," a superb film full of amazing wonders
","This is one of those films that captivated me and kept me on the edge of my seat. Now, I was one in a few people that had never read the book. I need to though. It was so amazing of how these actors who played the roles like Gandalf and Frodo would play it so effectively. The direction by Peter Jackson is astonishing. He did a pretty good job at keeping the film and the book at a pure simplicity. I hope he wins an Academy Award for it. Better yet, this film will receive a few Oscars. I thought the battle scenes was great too. I could easily compare the battle scenes to the scenes from Braveheart and Gladiator because they seem realistic and some people would look at it as fights between the good and the evil. Ian McKellen is the actor i would give kudos to because i heard that in the novel, Gandalf was a seven-foot man and what he did with that role was incredible. i mean, i couldn't imagine Ian McKellen playing a large man but he did it with pure ability and wit. This is a excellent movie. It adds up to my list of favorite movies and it is also a film of many genres. it is a drama, a love story, an action/adventure and a tale of courage and destiny. I recommend this film to anyone who likes to kill three hours of their time. You will be amazed!",Null,0,0,3 January 2002
The Shining," It gave me the chills.
","Every time I see this film, Jack Torrance always haunts me in my sleep. Out of all the horror films that I have seen, this is the best one yet. Jack Nicholson's performance's was over the top. He was so creepy I got scared of him. It gave me goosebumps when he tried to haunt Wendy. I got to tell you, Stanley Kubrick has done it again. If he was alive today, I would love to work with him. Others might think it would be hard because he would make every actor do a hundred takes or so. Out of the subject, if you love horror movies, then see this one. Stay away from the others. Anyway, I recommend this movie to people who loooove horror movies. 10 out of 10",Null,0,0,5 August 2000
American Beauty," the best goddamn movie ever
","I must say, i was completely blown away by this movie. I mean, everything in this movie I can completely relate to. This are a group of people who are going through a midlife crisis and feel alienated by their friends and peers. While I was watching this movie, I felt Lester Burnham's pain, of what he had to go through. In real life, I'm sort of Lester Burnham in real life. Anybody who thinks this movie sucks or for some of you teenage valley girls who thinks this movie is sick and perverted, you need to have your head examined. This is movie will have you say to yourself 'I'm sort of like these people too.' I LOVE THIS MOVIE! IT ROCKS!",10,0,0,23 January 2001
JFK," Oliver Stone's controversial film about who killed JFK
","In 1991, one film spited controversy and it was one of the most provocative films of all time. It was a film about the JFK assassination and one man devoted most of his life for this conspiracy. It even led to a passage called the Assassinations Material Disclosures Act. It even earned 2 Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. What film am i talking about? JFK. One of my all time favorite films and I considered this Oliver Stone's best work. It was so powerful I even bought it on DVD. It was not only Oliver Stone's best film, it was Oliver Stone's conspiracy theory about who killed John F. Kennedy. The best scene in this film is near the end where Kevin Costner's character makes that powerful speech. It was a film that you will never forget. Whenever you watch it, you feel like you are in Jim Garrison's footsteps. You want to find who was in this conspiracy and you want to put all the pieces together in the puzzle. It had the hugest cast that I had ever seen in movies. Believe me, it is a must-see. It's like what Oliver Stone said: 'What the past is prologue. To forget the past is to be condemned to relive it.' And I am so proud that I bought this film. If you read this comment that I made, you want to go out and watch this film. If you haven't seen it, SEE IT. You will never forget.",10,0,10,1 January 2000
Once Upon a Time in America," A tale of love, greed, and betrayal
","The first time that I saw this film was a few months ago on TNT. And it was a film that I will never forget. It was touching and very sad. It almost brung a tear to my eye. This was considered to be Sergio Leone's best film of all time. But sadly it was his final. It was a tale of five Jewish kids form New York during the Prohibition Era. And they promised in their hearts that they would die for each other. But as adults. they did. I don't know why this film didn't even earn a Oscar nomination. It could have for Sergio Leone's brilliant direction and Ennio Morricone's music. I must say, this is the most powerful film that I have ever witnessed in my life. After I watched this film, I would have never forgotten a film so mesmerizing. When this film came out, it was at 2 hours and 19 minutes. But when it was released on home video. It came out in a almost complete version of 3 hours and 47 minutes. Rumor has it that there is a European version that runs eight hours. I hope that I will see this film again and I hope that there is a director's cut of it. This is not like any other crime movie like The Godfather or Goodfellas. This is the ultimate mobster film. Probably the most violent scene was the scene where Noodles fails to rape Debra. If you haven't seen this film, then SEE IT! It is worth four hours of your time. It is a must-see movie. I gave it a five out of five because it was a powerful and superb movie.",Null,0,1,6 January 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Stanley Kubrick's best film
","Some of the people were really put off by this film because of the nudity of this film and the sexual nature. Let me point out, this was intended to be a art movie. There like pictures you see in the museum. Most parents who saw this film didn't like it because of the nudity. Because they just don't know the meaning of art. They think art movies are cartoons. It's bull. I think this is Stanley Kubrick's best film. Both Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman gave superb performance. It's about how people get lured into the world of sex an pay huge consequences. When i first saw this film, I was captivated. However, the funny thing is is that it had a twisted ending. I'll bet that when people walked out of the theater, they would yell out 'That's it!' It's a shame that Stanley Kubrick passed away last year. We could have seen more of his work. Anyway, highly recommended for people who are fans of Tom Cruise or Mr. Kubrick. 10 out of 10",Null,0,0,4 August 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," The Best Prison Film
","I must say that this is the best prison films of all time. I couldn't believe that this film didn't win any Academy Awards. This film could have win at least one or two. Also, I thought that Tim Robbins could have earned an Oscar nomination. He gave a superb performance. But the one who was powerful in this film is Morgan Freeman. He gave one of the best performances that I have ever seen in film. It was heartwrenching. I like that tagline: Fear can make you prisoner, Hope can set you free. Frank Darabont did superb filmmaking in this film. By the way, I found out that Allen Greene, the person that Frank dedicated at the end, was the director's agent and his close personal friend. If you want to see a film that takes place in a prison or dramatic films, then see this film. You will never regret it. It is the best prison film since Midnight Express. SEE IT!",10,0,0,5 January 2000
Shrek," the best animated movie (ever!!)
","I have seen many animated movies and they were quite good but they didn't really seem realistic to me as much. having watched shrek, i think this may be the best animated movie ever full of realism. The film wasn't afraid to show off their artsy humor and that humor in shrek was well executed in the right parts. all of the major cast members (especially Mike Myers) did a magnificent and mellifluous job of voicing the characters. throughout the movie, i couldn't stop laughing. the film was hilarious, funny, witty and, most of all, smart. i believe this film has taken the place as well of my Top 10 favorite films of all time. if i ever have a so-so day, I'll remember to pop this film on my DVD player and sit back with some orange juice and popcorn and enjoy. i hope this film will deserve some Oscars and Shrek may be the best animated movie EVER!!! if you want to see a animated movie full of wit, see it! you will be amazed!",Null,0,0,25 December 2001
Casino," violent but amazing
","I usually wonder if Goodfellas was a prequel to Goodfellas or the sequel to Goodfellas. Believe or nor, it was one of the most violent films of all time and a great one thanks to maverick director Martin Scorsese. Every movie he makes, it earns an Oscar nomination or two. For example, this film earned Sharon Stone and oscar nomination. But this is the only film I known that had tons of 'F' words. There was a rumor that it had 362 'F' words. There was no film that had extreme rapid-fire profanity. But this film had. I think that one of the most violent ever filmed was the scene where the mobster take Nicky Santoro and his brother to the cornfield and they beat the crap out of him and his brother. And the other was the scene where Nicky Santoro puts someone in a vice and squeezes his hand you that his eyeballs popped out. Part of that scene is cut to avoid a NC-17 rating. If you haven't seen it, SEE It. You will never forget it.",Null,1,2,5 January 2000
Braveheart," a masterpiece about the fight for freedom
","I remember seeing a bit of the film on HBO and chunks of it on USA and now, when i finally saw the whole thing a few hours ago, i was captivated by the theme as well as the impact of the movie. It took a lot of guts for Mel Gibson to star in the film as well as star in it and he deserved that Best Director Oscar. Rarely, have we seen actors who have direct themselves into a good performance. i believe that i saw it in Mel Gibson. this may be one of the best war movies that i have ever seen. all of the cast members were wonderful, especially Mel Gibson. The battle scenes may be a little bit stomach-turning and brutal but, as the viewer, it is important to show the violence of what happened between the Scottish and the British back at those times and it is brilliant film making and the best fight scenes ever captured on film. this is a film about the fight for freedom and the courage to free your heart and follow your dreams and to achieve it at a high peak. I also thought that the music was wonderful too as well as the cinematography which was beautifully filmed. The music, by James Horner, gives a deft subtleness of the movie and creates the tone. I recommend this film to everyone because this film is like a sonnet as well as a history lesson. it is a incredible movie and a film that will live on forever.",10,1,3,28 December 2001
Gladiator," a masterpiece of courage
","Some people would compare this film to Braveheart. it may be true but not always. Braveheart was a film about a man's fight for freedom. Gladiator is a film about a man's fight for justice and what he feels should be rational. i saw this film once again on New Year's Day and i was captivated by it. Russell Crowe gave a performance of what I led to belive may be the best performance he has ever given. One of the many aspects of the film is the direction as well as the cinematography. Ridley Scott is a visionary director and he creates this movie pictures that will stick out in our minds forever. the battle scenes as well as the stadium scenes may be quite brutal but it's important to know about it and see it because these most of the people back in those times who fought in these stadiums were slaves and they fought to show that they were courageous and wanted their justice. this may be a one of those films that was rapidly paced. The film was two and a half hours long but it seemed like a hour less because the film went by so quickly. I really believe that Gladiator is one of the best films i have ever seen as well as one of the best action films i have ever seen. The acting was excellent and the directing was magnificent. If you want to see a movie that will leave you in awe or what to learn about the history of ancient societies such as Roman societies, take a look at this film. You will be amazed!",Null,0,0,3 January 2002
Goodfellas," the best mob movie in the decade
","When Martin Scorsese reunited with two-time Oscar winner Robert De Niro for the sixth time, it turned out to be one of the most powerful films of all time. There were superb performances in this excellent film. Mostly the one who did good was from Joe Pesci here as Tommy DeVito. He was very funny even in the 'You Think I'm Funny' scene. He truly deserved that Academy Award. The first time that I saw this film was back a few years ago and I thought it was a good film. In fact, my dad saw it and he like it so much that he bought it on DVD. The best song in this film was the piano version of 'Layla'. Any body who saw this film either sang to the lyrics or dance to the beat. I think that Bobby De Niro and Marty Scorsese once again worked beautifully well in this film. They have been friends for a long time. They collaborated in 8 films. And the results were outstanding. Do me a favor. If you haven't seen this film then SEE IT!",Null,0,0,6 January 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Coens Are At It Again
","Once again, the Coen Brothers have a made a feel-good movie that will make you laugh and will make you jump from your seat. I believed that everybody in the film did outstanding in this movie. i just saw this movie yesterday at the theaters and I was really impressed by it. When I when to the theater for 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', people saw it because of George clooney and how much of a hunk he is. For me, i saw it because of the Coen Brothers. There are outstanding and talented filmmakers and I can't wait to see more of their work. They did a magnificent job on this movie and plus, they have a really good idea of how to make people laugh. The Coen Brothers are one of those writer/directors that are good at it. I hope this film gets some Oscar nominations. This is a very funny film and Joel and Ethan Coen, if you're reading this, i love you guys. Hey, cast me in one of your movies.",10,1,1,15 January 2001
