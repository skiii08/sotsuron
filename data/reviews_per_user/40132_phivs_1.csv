Mission: Impossible III," Mission Accomplished
","I was lucky enough to attend the premiere in London the other night, and after seeing MI:2 was not really hoping for anything other than your average, formulaic, big budget, Tom Cruise Show TM... On walking out I had become a convert. The film literally blew me away, and I believe that it has everything to do with Mr Cruise's decision to take on J.J Abrams as director and give him free reign on this movie. This really was a masterstroke, as he has taken MI back to its original TV roots (everything from the soundtrack to the opening credits). No more over complex story lines, just a mission and an objective, all conceived with brilliant direction and jaw dropping set pieces. J.J Abrams may have done for this franchise what Martin Campbell (director) did for Goldeneye, and I would be very surprised if there was not an MI:4 in the pipeline after this.Throughout the whole movie fans of 'Lost' and 'Alias' will immediately recognise the directors little touches, and I really do think this guy is an autuer in the making. But is what is most fantastic about this film is the fact that it doesn't try to be too clever, or be something its not. It is what it is. Forgetting about whatever you may read and think of Tom Cruise, his questionable beliefs and/or his private life, do not let that put you off seeing this movie. Although most of it is The Tom Cruise Show TM (just like MI) it is one of the best episodes.",9,4,10,27 April 2006
