Kill Bill: Vol. 2," The second half of the story is much better than the first!
","'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is not as much a sequel to Volume 1 as it is the second half of the story.  In the first half (some very predictable spoilers ahead) The Bride kills Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) and Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), two of the five assassins who gunned down The Bride at her wedding rehearsal. In Volume 2, she goes after the last three: Sidewinder (Michael Madsen), now a lifeless hick, California Mountain Snake (Darryl Hannah), a mysterious one-eyed fighter, and, of course, Bill (David Carradine), the leader of their former group of assassins and The Bride's former flame.Since in Volume 1 there were no major plot developments or big twists (except for the very last scene) it left a lot - a whole lot - of room for action.  And that there was, scene after scene of bloody action, and that worked for that one.  In Volume 2, however, since it is the second half of the story, and the climax, all the plot starts to come together.  The characters are developed fully, there are others introduced, and a few plot twists are thrown at you.After all, Hannah, Madsen and Carradine had little-to-nothing to do in Volume 1, whereas in Volume 2 their characters bloom so naturally and gradually.  Budd (Madsen) is introduced sipping bear from a coffee can, sitting at his trailer door, shrugging off that The Bride is coming to kill him and then showing up at his job to have his loser boss push him around (despite Budd being a former assassin).  When The Bride comes and Budd collects her priceless sword, he sees it as a chance to turn up a new leaf. The character of Elle Driver (Hannah) shows up and ruins Budd's plans, that's how she's introduced.But Bill, he's the best character of the film.  Carradine captures the character's mannerisms perfectly.  How he talks, how he moves, how he fights, how he can go from friendly to sadistic to intense to evil with just his eyes and the tone of his voice in seconds.  It is an Oscar worthy performance all the way, he better nab the 2004 Best Supporting Actor.Of course, I haven't even mentioned Uma Thurman.  Her performance in Volume 1 was brutal and dynamic, but not very versatile.she wasn't able to go many places with her character, because all she did was kill.  In Volume 2 we see the entire transformation of her character from an airhead blonde to a skillful killer in a flashback scene, and we get to see her character put in many emotional situations, most notably when she is buried alive.  I'm glad Thurman didn't get an Oscar nomination in 2003, but it'll be a crime if she doesn't get one this year.Quentin Tarantino.  Have I said his name yet?  Do I need to?  I must say, his talents are much better expressed in this volume.  In the first the lines were good, but not all that great, in this half they have that special, wonderful Tarantino feel that is both natural and authentic. Best Screenplay?  Yes.  Best Director?  Definitely.Kill Bill is the years best so far, that may change, but it would take a very good movie to deny this the title, 8.5/10.",Null,1,2,16 April 2004
Scarface," The first and last forty-five minutes are good, but everything in between is mediocre...
","Some spoilers, if you haven't already heard the ending.'Scarface' starts off with an overly tanned Al Pacino getting interrogated by three Immigrations Officers.  His character, Cuban Tony Montana, recently arrived in America, and is trying to hide his obvious history of crime from the cops.  This scene lasts quite long, and is both an interesting and funny introduction to one of America's most favorite characters.  I was content.After three long hours 'Scarface' ends with one of cinema's most bloody gunfights.  Because of his betraying mob boss Sosa (Paul Shenar), Tony 'Scarface' Montana is attacked in his mansion by at least thirty machine-gun toting assassins.  After his sister and bodyguards are killed, Scarface pulls an assault rifle out of his cabinet and introduces the assassins to 'his little friend'.  I was very content.Unfortunately, the hour and a half (give or take a few minutes) in between is a little slow, and, well, boring.  It features the cliches of every 'coming to power' mob movie.  Montana does coke, parties at clubs, and enters into a rotten marriage with Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). Unfortunately, I've seen it all before.  Still, 'Scarface' doesn't become too repetitive ('Casino') or too glitzy ('Donnie Brasco'), which is good.'Scarface', as many have said before me, is a classic man's movie, but nothing with too much substance or acting, 7/10.",7,0,1,2 September 2003
Alien 3," Good, underrated installment of the classic series...
","...'Alien3' is the most underrated movie of all time (well...maybe).  I can't believe people's excuses for not liking this film.  Just a few days ago a friend said he didn't like it because 'the good guys had no weapons'. Nevermind that the characters in the first 'Alien' also had no weapons.  In fact, 'Alien3' is one of the few third installments that still keeps the series alive.The story focuses on our hero, Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) landing on a remote planet that doubles as a prison.  There she befriends doctor Clemens (Charles Dance) and inmate Dillon (Charles S. Dutton).  Clemens helps her come to realize that there was an alien on board her escape pod before he is killed off (a little too early, I have to say).  After Clemens is killed, Ripley,  Dillon and the other inmates devise a plan to help kill the alien.This a very scary movie.  Director Fincher made his film debut with 'Alien3' and established himself as one of the greatest mystery/horror directors of our time.  The climax involves the inmates running throughout the maze that is a prison, trying to lure the alien into a trap, creating some of the most suspenseful chase scenes that I've seen.'Alien3' is a fun, cool, exciting movie that is highly underrated, 8/10.",Null,1,3,28 July 2003
Miracle," One of the better sports underdog movies
","When I try to come up with sports movies that are actually good, I can only think of two: `Hoosiers' and `Remember the Titans'.  `Hoosiers' was good because of the performances of Hackman, Hopper and Hershey, but it created little-to-no suspense for the basketball team.  Denzel Washington and Will Patton lifted `Remember the Titans' but that film was great because of how well we got to know the football players, and because of the cheery tone. `Miracle' is a balancing act, focusing on both coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell) and the players of the team.Brooks is, of course, the main character, but we never stray away from the players of the team for too long.  Director Gavin O'Connor said he either had to hire actors and teach them to play hockey (impossible) or to hire hockey players and teach them how to act.  Thankfully, he chose the latter. And they're not half bad, either.Of course, the best performance of the film comes from Russell  and it's probably the best performance of his career, too.  He masters the accent, the determination, and the anger.  He was born to play Herb Brooks.  He gets awesome support, too, from Patricia Clarkson and Noah Emmerich, among others.When I rented `Hoosiers' the cover said that the film was praised for its `revolutionary' camera techniques that capture the basketball action.  If those were revolutionary, I'm not sure if theirs a word in the English language that describes the cinematography in this film.  I was amazed by how effortlessly the cameras followed the wonderfully choreographed hockey action.  I don't want to even imagine the hard work that the hockey scenes must've been, but it doesn't seem that way.One thing I must say is that the movie feels reallyheavy.  It's so full of drama that it makes it sort of exhausting to watch.  That's the only flaw: I don't think I'd watch this movie twice.  It's strong and powerful, but a little too long and, well, thick.Still, this is definitely on par with `Hoosiers' and `Remember the Titans', a great sports movie and of the years best so far, 7.5/10.",Null,0,0,28 June 2004
Ali," Boring...as hell, actually
","Terrible.  I don't want to see a non-entertaining 'talking head' movie about a cocky, cheating boxer.  Sure, he may have been a really good boxer, but Brando's a really good actor and I'd hate to see a bio flick about him.  You know why?  Because he's self-centered and insane.There are about three fights in this movie, and yes, they're boring too. Yes, the fight scenes are boring, I never thought I'd say that about a movie, but I did, for Ali.The fact that Will Smith was nominated for an Oscar for this movie is offensive.  He acts the same as he does in almost every one of his other movies: cocky and funny (though he was a lot less funny in Ali, making him just cocky).  Oh, well, I guess Smith uses an accent in this, so maybe that's why... ...maybe not.  Boring movie, only redeeming factor is Jon Voight, and that's only because Jon Voight's in a movie where he doesn't look or sound like Jon Voight.  Bad movie, 5/10.",Null,4,8,28 June 2003
50 First Dates," One of Sandler's better films...
","...'50 First Dates' is about a sleazy dude (Adam Sandler) in Hawaii who again and again tricks tourist women into sleeping with him (he doesn't like commitment...clearly).  This all changes when one day he meets Lucy (Drew Barrymore) and basically falls in love with her at first sight.  He talks to her.  They hit it off.  The next day, though, she doesn't know who he is. He's told that she can't keep short term memories for more than a day (think 'Memento') because of a car crash so her father Marlin (Blake Clark) and brother Doug (Sean Astin) must recreate the same day over and over again (think 'Groundhog Day').That's basically what this is, 'Memento' meets 'Groundhog Day'.  The resulting fare isn't as impressive as either of those films, but it isn't bad either.  Lately you could say that Sandler is flushing his career down the toilet (with stinkers like 'Anger Management' and 'Mr. Deeds'), but this redeems him.  There is lots of good comedy - specifically from Sandler's friend 'Ula' (Rob Schneider) and Astin's Doug - and even the romance avoids being too sappy.One mentionable thing is Blake Clark's performance.  We haven't seen the guy in anything except small roles, but he shines in this one.  His performance as Lucy's dad is subtle and touching and funny, I want to see the guy in more.So, nothing amazing, but a considerable date movie, I give it a 7/10.",Null,0,0,25 March 2004
Spartacus," Entertaining, glorious film
","'Spartacus' is no doubt the 'Gladiator' of its time.  Starring Kirk Douglas as the skillful gladiator who escapes from his owner Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) and organizes a massive slave revolt.  Meanwhile Crassus (Laurence Olivier) and Grachus (Charles Laughton) try to manipulate the situation to their own benefit.With a movie starring Douglas and Olivier (among others) and directed by Stanley Kubrick there's really nothing to dislike about it.  The direction, action, performances, script are all admirable, an example of great, classic filmmaking.Mostly the acting though.  It would seem that Douglas is rigid as Spartacus, but it's just how his character reacts to the situations he's put in, and as the movie progresses he gets more relaxed in the role.  Olivier's bisexual Crassus is well acted as well, you sense his pride and love for Rome in his presence on screen.What's surprising here is Ustinov...well, not so much Ustinov but his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.  I'm not saying he did a bad job - it was a great and often hilarious performance, but it's also the kind of performance where you would think it should've won an Oscar, but it would never actually win.  I'm glad it did, though.What surprises me also is how great this movie is for all ages.  It isn't too bloody, or long for children, and it's of course wonderful for adults too.Anyway, this is a great and entertaining film for people of all ages, 8/10.",Null,1,1,21 April 2004
Casablanca," Beautiful movie, the best love story put on screen...
","...'Casablanca' stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, a bartender in the poor 1940s town of Casablanca.  Men and woman are constantly coming through here, looking for a ticket to America.  Police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) occasionally helps them out, but for a price - or the company of a beautiful woman.  One night Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) arrives at Rick's saloon, but what surprises Rick is the woman whom Laszlo bring along.  The woman is Ilsa Bund (Ingrid Bergman), Laszlo's wife and Blaine's former flame.  Ilsa's sudden appearance sends Blaine's new, well structured life into a swirl towards oblivion.Every actor plays their part perfectly.  Bogart delivers a cool and clever performance as Blaine, with memorable lines like 'I stick my neck out for nobody' he creates one of the most memorable and likable movie characters of all time.  Rains delivers a fun (and hilarious) performance too as the corrupt police captain.  He flirts and makes illegal deals, all the while keeping his smug grin and witty charm.I wouldn't call 'Casablanca' the best movie ever made, but it certainly is the best (and most realistic) love story that's ever been put on screen. The music, people, and even the town of Casablanca is beautiful.And so is 'Casablanca', 8.5/10.",10,3,3,26 July 2003
Finding Neverland," Good, but too simple, definitely not one of the year's best
","'Finding Neverland' is a lot like 'Ray', though not as good. They are both about men whose childhoods are practically destroyed by family tragedy but who create something magical and long-lasting in their adult lives, through the influence of others. 'Ray' was about a very influential black singer; 'Finding Neverland' is about the writer of 'Peter Pan'. Both premises could've been made into great movies. But, strangely, only 'Ray' was great.Oh, 'Finding Neverland' was good, but it was just too simple too be even compared to many of this year's movies, including 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2', 'Collateral', 'The Passion of the Christ', 'Closer' and 'The Life Aquatic'. Not to say simple movies aren't as good as complex ones, but the solutions this movie offers seems a lot more geared for children than adults, or even all-ages. I'm wondering if this is on purpose, because the film is essentially a bio-pic, and bio-pics are generally not one of children's basic genres.Of course I may be alone on this, everyone else seems to love it, but I find it very surprising that this film could inspire any form of adult. Its main message is 'with your imagination you can accomplish anything', which we've all heard, since we were very young, from many sources. Of course maybe it takes a simple little movie to remind you of it.So the Scottish Sir James Barrie (Johnny Depp) has writer's block, and his last play was a flop, and his impresario (Dustin Hoffman) is getting skeptical. His wife Mary Ansell (Radha Mitchell) is a little distant  he is not least at fault  and he spends his days sitting in the local park, writing in his notebook. One day he finds that a little boy is lying under his shoe, and then he meets the boys' brothers, and widow mother, Sylvia Llewelyn-Davies (Kate Winslet). Immediately he is smitten with the family, but not romantically, mind you. No, in a way Sir Barrie wants to be the boys' brother, and Sylvia's son.But some people get in the way: Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), Mary, and one of Sylvia's sons Peter (Freddie Highmore) are all fiercely against the union of James and the Davies family. Of course, to everyone but James, Sylvia and the other boys their time together looks scandalous and, well, creepy, but they understand that they are all just a big, happy family.Johnny Depp is skillful in playing characters that are in their own element  actually, come to think of it, all of his leading characters have some strange quirk that puts them in their own world. An android with sharp hands, an illiterate Buster Keaton fan, the worst film director of all time, one of the best drug dealers of all time, a drunken fruity pirate, a deadly CIA agent, and a shadowy authortake your pick. All of them completely different, except for the similarity of being one hundred percent unique. And now another to add to the list: Sir J.M. Barrie. This character's quirky curse is that his childhood was all but stolen from him (for reasons I wont spoil), and so he spends his adult life trying to steal it back. Yes, indeed, there is no romance between James and Sylvia, because at the age James is really at, girls to him are a still unfamiliar being who are there to look nice and clean (which makes his wedding with Mary a complete mystery). But James has still the wisdom and experience of an adult, so he seems less like he has a problem than a cute quirk. Johnny Depp balances this perfectly, it's a great performance.But not as great as that of Liam Neeson, Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, Paul Giamatti or Bill Murray. I seriously think this film is being over-praised. Depp was great, but not amazing, and most of the rest of the cast is underused  especially Hoffman  though Radha Mitchell shines. The movie itself isn't really a mass achievement eithersure, the costumes, sets and cinematography were great, but I think all that should be second to the writing and direction, which, I'm sad to say, isn't all that great. And there's an awkward scene at the end with Winslet, in her house, that would work a lot better as a dream or some sort of fantasy.So it's not a must-see, but you would enjoy parts if you watched it, and Depp and Mitchell turn in some good work, so I won't discourage you from seeing it. Just watch the other movies I mentioned first.7/10.",7,1,2,3 January 2005
Se7en," Cool, stylish, but still sad
","'Se7en' is a police drama about two cops trying to find a mysterious killer who is knocking off victims according to the sins they've committed.  The plot is intriguing, the acting is emotional, and the thrills are incredibly creepy.Though, this film wouldn't be as disturbing as some say it is.  Sure, the ending is sad, but aside from that, it's just as 'gross' as every other forensic movie.  In fact, movies like 'The Bone Collector' are more disgusting than this.And, of course, there's Fincher's excellent directing talent.  The camera angles are cool, the chase scenes are suspenseful, and the investigation is clever.  Morgan Freeman plays the grizzled old cop well, and Pitt delivers a more comedic performance than a dramatic one as the young Det. Mills.The best part of 'Se7en' would be Kevin Spacey's creepy role as the deadly killer.  Sure, Spacey looks like your regular nice guy, but that's what makes him so evil.  You hate him so much because you feel guilty for liking him.'Se7en' is a funny, dramatic, thrill-ride of a movie, 8.5/10.",Null,2,2,7 July 2003
The Big Lebowski," From what I've seen this is the Coen's best, and far superior to Fargo...
","...'The Big Lebowski' stars Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi as three loser slackers who get caught up in a kidnapping plot involving a paralyzed millionaire (David Huddelston), his porn-star wife (Tara Reid), a strange artist (Julianne Moore) and a group of German Nihilists (Peter Stormare, Flea and Torsten Voges).Of the Coen's movies I've seen 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy'.  All three where quite enjoyable, but 'Lebowski' leaves the other two far behind...on the ground...and coughing in its dust.  The dialogue is fast, furious and funny; the performances are grade A and the semi-complex plot is both easy to figure out and great fun to watch.Of course, if there is anything wrong, it is the language.  First it was 'Die Hard', then 'Reservoir Dogs', then this.  All great movies, but one wonders if so much language is necessary.  Still, its easy to get over, and it even parodies itself with Sam Elliot's 'Stranger' character, who questions why all the characters need to use 'so many cuss words'.But, as I said, the good outweighs the bad.  This is one rollicking fun and completely hilarious movie, 8.5/10.",10,0,1,22 September 2003
As Good as It Gets," Touching, beats Titanic in a second...
","...Titanic didn't touch you.  Sure, it impacted you, but what movie showing five-year-olds drowning doesn't?  As Good As It Gets, now this movie was touching, brilliant, funny, deep, and definitely Best Picture worthy.  The performances by Nicholson as the O.C.D. diagnosed romance novelist; Hunt as the slightly neurotic whiny waitress and Kinnear as the sad, gay artist are great.  Though I don't think that Kinnear did as good as Robin Williams from Good Will Hunting, he came very close.Cuba Gooding Jr. did well too, but I don't think it was one of his greatest performances.  Very good movie though, see it, 8.5/10.",Null,0,1,26 June 2003
Memento," Another classic gone unnoticed by the lousy Academy!

I'm not saying A Beautiful Mind was a bad film (in fact, it was a great movie) but it certainly wasn't as good as Memento.It's hard to talk about this film without any spoilers, but I'll just give you the basics of the plot: a man who can't create new memories after every five minutes (Pearce) is searching for 'John G.', the man who supposedly killed his wife.  Helping him (or are they?) are a drifter whose identity you're not very sure of (Pantoliano) and a bartender who may have an agenda of her own (Moss).That's all I'm going to say!  Now you go see the movie for yourself!  It's definitely worth it, 8.5/10.",Null,1,3,27 June 2003
Alien: Resurrection," I think this movie was a great career move for 'Gore'!
","I have to say,  I was worried about 'Gore''s career before 'Alien: Resurrection' because he seemed to be appearing in so few movies lately.  Of course, there was 'Se7en', but he only had a bit part in that.  Anyway, like I said, 'Gore' made a good decision signing on for this movie.  This is definitely 'Gore''s best movie.Do you find the above paragraph a little strange?  Well, believe it or not, it's true, because gore seems to be the main character of 'Alien: Resurrection.  It certainly isn't Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), playing a character who was already killed off in the last one (but hey, logic doesn't matter when it comes to producers making money).  After you see 'Alien: Resurrection' you'll agree that gore has the most screen time in this pathetic excuse for a movie.The 'story' focuses on Ripley being 'resurrected' (or cloned, but they decided to go with a biblical reference) because the company needs the alien to use as a weapon.  The alien, of course, gets free and starts to kill off everyone on the ship.  Only Ripley (who is now Super Ripley because of a weird bond she now shares with the alien) can save the human race from the alien!The only thing I was ever confused about for the Alien movies was just, why is 'The Company' so eager to get a new weapon?  Throughout the entire series I've never heard of any opposition there is towards The Company, and The Company seems to be the dominant ruler of the Universe.  So why are they so eager to get a new weapon?  Oh yeah, I almost forgot about the whole 'Producers Who Want More Money' thing.'Alien: Resurrection' is one of the biggest disappointments in cinematic history, 3.5/10.",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," One of the best adventure movies in a long while...
","...'Pirates of the Caribbean' ranks up there with the 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Indiana Jones' trilogies for good adventure.  I've always been waiting for a fun pirate movie, and now I've got what I've been waiting for.The story focuses on four characters: Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a former Pirate Captain who wants his boat (the Black Pearl) back.  Cpt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), the evil pirate (now captain of the Black Pearl), who is cursed to be immortal because of stealing treasure from the Aztecs.  Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a young black smith getting help from Sparrow to save his love from Barbossa, and Elizabeth Swoon (Kyra Knightley), Turner's love and Barbossa's captive.Each actor plays their character perfectly.  Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush deliver the best performances out of the bunch, being the best actors.  Depp is cool, and funny as hell as Sparrow, and you can't get much creepier than a skeleton version of Geoffrey Rush as your lead villain.'Pirates' is a must-see for all families out there.  Fun, funny, and cool, this certainly deserved all the good reviews, 8.5/10.",10,0,1,11 July 2003
Coffee and Cigarettes," Slow, but each segment is terribly interesting
","Jim Jarmusch's 'Coffee & Cigarettes' is like a good painting: it's interesting to look at, subtle, simple, and strangely enigmatic in that you think the point is hiding just under the surface. It is also funny, and 'cool' in the Tom Waits/Michael Madsen sort of way.It's about nothing in particular, a collection of short films all involving two or three people, sitting in a diner somewhere at lunch time, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee, and conversing over banalities. Each segment lasts about ten minutes or so, and is so interesting because they grab us with some really intriguing characters, people, and performances - and sometimes all three.It's got one of the most diverse casts I've ever seen (Steve Coogan, Steve Buscemi, Bill Murray, Alfred Molina, Iggy Pop, Cate Blanchett, Meg White, Jack White, RZA, GZA, Tom Waits, Roberto Begnini and others still) but it's not uneven; we don't feel like we're jumping from one genre to the next, maybe because it feels a little like Jarmusch has sucked the life out of these genres. Each segment is very laid back, the characters either nonchalant or trying to appear that way, with some exceptions.The opening segment has Steven Wright and Roberto Begnini, both equally incomprehensible. Then Steve Buscemi explaining conspiracy theories to Cinque and Joie Lee (the guy can play anyone). Then Iggy Pop and Tom Waits, who seem to only be visiting each other to have a contest in condescending (Waits wins). And so on and so forth.Some astounding performances can be spotted, astounding because they're so understated. Cate Blanchett plays both herself and her jealous cousin, and deserved an Oscar nomination. Steve Coogan plays himself with Alfred Molina, and it's fun to see how Coogan tries to control the conversation, then gets thrown for a loop. Bill Murray is, naturally, gut-busting funny.Behind it all we sense the artist's hand, lathering on layer after enigmatic layer. Cheers to Jarmusch, who managed to pull together such a diverse cast and extract perfection from all of them.It's not a great movie, it's not important, but it is fun, and cool, and interesting to watch around lunch time, with some coffee.7/10",7,4,7,28 August 2005
Spider-Man 2," Contrary to popular opinion, Dr. Octopus was done perfectly...
","By now (only a few days after the movie's release) I've seen many reviews saying that Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) is an underwritten villain.Anyone who knows the comics will know that he was done just right.  Doc Ock was always a mercenary-type villain, hiring himself out to do others' (usually more powerful, social types) bidding, all the while working for an agenda of his own.  This shows in the movie, when he strikes a deal with Harry Osborn (James Franco), which I wont spoil.  Also, Doc Ock was never a complex character anyway  he practically wasn't human.  Always out for himself, always concocting some master plan for Spider-Man to foil.  He never shows a shred of decency or human compassion; he is, basically, a robot.I was wondering how they were going to do that for the movie, because movies need complex characters, of course.  And Raimi and the writers did it effortlessly: having Ock be a good man taken over by the AI of the tentacles attached to his body, so that he is, actually, a robot.  It perfectly explains why the villain character is so `one-dimensional'.But the other half of him, the good, human half (Octavius) is a complex character.  He's smart, determined, and a bit too prideful about his life's work, making him and the tentacles a perfect mix for a villain character. Sure, he's not a major part of the movie, but Ock was always a mysterious character that only left the shadows if he desperately needed something for himself, exactly like it is in the film.And a great film it is, too, may it rise on the Top 250, 8.5/10.",Null,0,0,3 July 2004
Spider-Man 2," A strong departure from the silliness of the first film, 'Spider-Man 2' is, definitely, the best super-hero film ever made!
","Since `Super-Man' flew into the big screens in the late seventies there have been many a try at other famous (and not so famous) comic book heroes. Among them were `Batman' (1989-98) and its sequels, `Dick Tracy' (1990), `X-Men' and its sequel (2000-03), `Spider-Man' (2002), `Daredevil' (2003), `Hulk' (2003) and `Hellboy' (2004).  Out of these there have only been a few real successes: `Dick Tracy', `Batman Returns' the `X-Men' films, and `Hulk'`Spider-Man 2' leaves them all  even the good ones  choking in its dust.Not that they were all bad films  no, `Batman Returns' and `X-Men' were great movies, and `Hulk' and `Dick Tracy' were visually amazing.  Still, none of the above films were really able to capture the attention of audiences who weren't fans of the comics.  `Spider-Man 2' does just that. It doesn't leave any questions unanswered, assuming that everyone in the audience knows the story already, as `Hellboy' did often and the `X-Men' films sometimes too.  We get to know each character intimately, they're people, not just caricatures of the original characters.  And yet, it still winks at the comic book fans in the audience, with lines like `How bout Dr. Strange'?' `Good, but taken!'The plot picks up two years after the first film ended, with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) still in love with Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and still too afraid to tell her because of the risks.  His friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) has grown older, now more confident and in control of Oscorp, his dead father's company (which doesn't make much sense, because in the first film Norman Osborn was let go, so Harry couldn't be the heir anymore). Harry is also an angry alcoholic, and dreams of exacting vengeance on Spider-Man for killing his father (who, as we all know, was The Green Goblin of the first film).  Also, Parker's Aunt May's (Rosemary Harris, who gets a lot more screen time in this one) mortgage has just been foreclosed.Could things get worse for Spidey?  Of course, I haven't even mentioned the villain yet.  Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), a brilliant scientist, is working on a plan to generate fusion that can give lots of cheap power to the city (`the power of the sun in the palm of my hand'), something he's been dreaming of doing in years.  To work with the fusion he creates four mechanical tentacles, which he can control because of a chip that gives the power to his brain, not the AI of the claws.  When his experiment goes awry, the chip is destroyed and the machine part of him takes over, he becomes a criminal  Dr. Octopus (Doc Ock').I loved Ock's whole story arch.  It all fits together perfectly: Octavius is a good man, but he has a bit too much pride and is a little stubbornly determined to carry out his dream.  So when the AI takes over it taps into these flaws and uses them to brainwash Octavius into once again carrying out his fusion plan  now knowing how dangerous it is.  We never really get a straight answer as to why the claws (who become characters themselves) want to work on the fusion as well, but I guess we can assume that they want to because its their function, its why they were made.Soon after Octavius starts wreaking havoc on New York Parker decides to end his days as Spider-Man to pursue what he really wants  a life with Mary-Jane.  She's engaged now though, but she's soon drawn back to Parker once he's given her more attention and affection.  Meanwhile, Harry strikes up a deal with Dr. Octopus: if he delivers Spider-Man, Harry will in turn provide for Ock's experiment.In a way the film has two different stories  the Peter Parker/Mary-Jane romance and the Spider-Man/Doc Ock/Harry tale.  The two stories don't merge until the end, and when they do the drama reaches a high point: Spider-Man's secret identity is revealed to more than a few vital characters, the city is torn apart, etc.  What's surprising is, you'll find yourself more concerned and interested in the romance story than Spider-Man and Doc Ock's battles (not that the latter isn't done well either).Everything that made the first film silly and stupid has disappeared from the second (including writer David Koepp  whose script looked good but was ultimately hollow).  The writing is sharper, the acting is far better, the action is more exciting, the special effects have improved greatly and the drama is more engrossing.  In the first film the drama was just the obligatory filling between action scenes, but in `Spider-Man 2' you'll find all of it interesting.The actors  especially Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Molina and J.K. Simmons  lift the film even further.  Maguire is maturing along with his character, Dunst embodies her part, Molina makes an excellent villain, Franco is great and Simmons is hilarious. The film is not flawless though.  I thought two sequences lasted just a bit too long.  The scene where Octavius awakes in a hospital room and his tentacles go bezerk should've been much shorter, with all the screaming and yelling it goes from frighteningly intense to silly parody.  The second was the train scene, when Spider-Man must save a subway train from crashing. This one wasn't as bad it was just a little repetitive (but it ended well).The ending of the film was great too  it, of course, leaves it open for a sequel.  Not in a cheesy, obvious way (see `Jurassic Park III'), but more in a short reference that fits well with the flow of the film.When the actors said that `Spider-Man 2' was better than the first they weren't lying.  A super-hero movie for everyone, a recommendation to all.  I anxiously look forward to `Spider-Man 3', 8.5/10.",Null,0,0,1 July 2004
Batman Returns," Best superhero movie ever made! It's like a PG-13 horror movie!
","Batman is definitely the best superhero movie ever made.  Michael Keaton beats Adam West, George Clooney and Val Kilmer by a mile as the Dark Knight. His performance isn't Oscar worthy or anything, but it was still good.The best performances are obviously given by the three villains though. Danny DeVito plays the Penguin with a sadness but still as evil as every other comic book villain.  Christopher Walken's Max Schreck is calmly cool and sinister, but the one who steals the show is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  You really feel sorry for her, and I may sound crazy, but she deserved an Oscar Nomination for it.The action is great and tense, and the fight scenes are well-done (considering the heavy 'batsuit' Keaton had to wear).  And, of course, Tim Burton's directoral touch makes this movie like his usual stuff: comedic horror.Great movie, 8.5/10.",7,0,0,29 June 2003
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A joke, but a good one
","Here's a movie that deserved every criticism it got, and is still pretty good. Yes, the script is horrible, and the story worse. Yes, the characters do things that make no sense just to push the movie along. No, it's certainly not a movie that does any justice to its titular character. But it's still kind of fun.Let me explain. You take three issues of any comic book, read them in order, a lot of the time, it's not gonna make much sense. But the word bubbles are so small, the pictures are so big, you don't really care. The characters do some crazy things, and it looks good. That's this movie all over. It starts with Wolverine, hero of the 'X-Men' trilogy, as a child in pre-Canada Canada. He and his older brother go through some incomprehensible family trouble; Wolverine sprouts his bone claws, shouts 'NO!' up into the air and the opening credits montage starts. That's what kind of movie this is.Wolvie and his brother grow up, his brother becomes Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber), and they fight through every major American war together, simply to do it I guess. Maybe the film's director, the artistically higher-minded Gavin Hood, wanted to portray Wolvie and his brother as salt of the Earth, regular Men-type characters. It works good enough I guess, but all we get is a couple neutered fight scenes and a lot of snarling for the camera. They come off more like figures in the opening sequence of a video game, where you're waiting for the game to start.So Wolvie and Creed join this covert group of mutant spies/soldiers, one of them is Ryan Reynolds, one of them is Will.i.am, they each have powers, and so on. They go to another country and we get some impossible (but still aesthetically-pleasing) action scenes where some of them get to demonstrate their powers. Something happens, they get split up. Wolvie ends up living with a schoolteacher who is strangely good at 'persuasion' (a bizarre attempt at subtle foreshadowing in a movie about people with superhuman powers).The woman, her character, is the glue that ties the whole movie together and the underlying joke beneath everything. She's given a couple lines in the beginning to create some sort of totally misguided Native American mystical past for her, but all we're thinking is, 'Who is she, and why is she in the movie?' Wolvie's in love with her, or at least acts like he is, which is to say Hugh Jackman tries his best to act like he is, but there's absolutely nothing there and everyone seems to know it. She's a shameless, walking Plot Device, and the final bit of fate dealt to her character, and Jackman's final moment with her, is like a hilarious punchline to the idiocy of the whole story.Everything else has Wolvie running around, sprouting his claws, meeting some semi-to-actually-kinda-interesting characters like Blob and Gambit, and running in slow motion to do battle with his brother, Creed. Schreiber plays this role with real commitment and gusto, and an apparent lack of interest in how he looks. He comes off so crazy and ruthless he achieves that insane cartoon level of acting you see sometimes from Johnny Depp or, say, Danny DeVito in 'Batman Returns.' This movie really made me like Schreiber; I want him to take more roles like this one in the future.Listen, it's not great. But it is funny – be that intentionally or not – and it has some beautiful action scenes, particularly one atop a giant smoke stack at the end. They're not beautiful in concept or execution, just in the childish innocence of it all. See it once, or a couple times, for a few laughs.7/10",7,3,4,5 August 2009
The Mummy," Another great adventure film!
","From Brendan Frasier's wisecracks to the climactic sword-fighting scene, The Mummy doesn't disappoint.  This ranks up there with the Indiana Jones movies for great action adventure movies.The classic, reborn story focuses on a group of archeologists (Brendan Frasier, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah and others) in Egypt, searching for the legendary 'City of the Dead'.  Eventually they find it, but also a centuries old mummy who proceeds to kill them off one by one.This is a truly epic movie, that never causes you to lose your attention. From start to end, I loved it.8/10.",Null,1,2,1 July 2003
Troy," Didn't live up to its hype, but a good film nonetheless...
","Ever since the first trailer of 'Troy' - the one with all the ships - people have been saying this would be an amazing cinematic epic, up for many Oscars, one of the greatest adventure/war movies ever made. It's not. In fact, it's very, very far away from all that. It's an inch away from being mediocre.The plot has Trojan princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) making peace with former enemy Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson). Unfortunately, Paris has a hard-on for Menelaus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger) and steals her away once Hector and him leave Menelaus' kingdom. When Menelaus finds out he enlists his power-hungry brother Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to join him in war against Troy. Agamemnon doesn't care about Menelaus' personal vengeance, though; he just wants to conquer Troy. So he calls in the greatest warrior on Earth, Achilles (Brad Pitt), to lead his battle, but Achilles is a rebellious jerk and causes Agamemnon a lot of trouble.There are a lot of super-unnecessary dramatic parts to this film that don't make much sense. One of which is Achilles' wanting to be always remembered as a great warrior but then refusing to participate in the greatest battle of all time. His excuse is that he doesn't like the politics about it...well, I don't know where Achilles got his reputation, then, 'cause it obviously wasn't by fighting wars. If it were, he'd have already known that war is all politics.Another mistake is the subplot between Paris and Helen  it just wasn't handled correctly. Everyone knows that Paris is a whiny, selfish brat - he gets a whole damned war started because of an erection - but for some reason he was written to be liked. He's a coward and complete moron; he should be shown that way. But instead they show him as a hero to Helen and Troy...instead of the guy who single-handedly killed a peace contract and an entire country.As far as acting goes, it varies. Most of the performances were not necessarily bad, just not good. Kruger's lines are terrible so her performance is at least forgivable. Bloom is basically confused as to whom he's playing the whole time, and it shows on screen - not a very good performance. Brad Pitt should stick to playing psychos; his action hero roles just don't work. Gleeson and Saffron Burrows do what they can with their little roles.The film's best performances - and the best parts of the film - are Eric Bana, Sean Bean, Brian Cox and, of course, Peter O'Toole. Bana shines in this one, his first great American performance, and if there were anything Oscar worthy about this film it'd be him. Bean has a small role but he's terrific in it, another great warrior but still able to differentiate itself from his Boromir character from 'Lord of the Rings'. Cox is a great villain, he's very 'cool evil', much like his Stryker character from 'X2'. O'Toole, well, I was expecting a great performance and he gave one (the only other Oscar worthy performance of the flick).The writing is pretty badthe old style that the characters talk in is mastered but what they're saying needed more work. All of the characters basically scream out the film's points (war is bad, war politics are bad, etc.) instead of letting us the audience take it for ourselves. There were two particularly great scenes though, the first being a sad and intense scene where Hector prepares to meet Achilles in battle, and the second being Priam (Peter O'Toole) begging Achilles to let him give his dead son a proper burial. Both scenes were intense, dramatic and perfectly acted.Most of the technical aspects are good, but its blown out of the water by movies like 'Lord of the Rings' and even old epics such as 'The Ten Commandments'. The action is kind of messy and unimpressive; the only good fight scene is between Bana and Pitt. The score is too repetitive, but there is a great song that plays in the credits.It's a good half hour too long too, and gets kind of repetitive by the end, but overall it's a good film, though nothing special, 7.5/10.",Null,2,5,27 May 2004
X-Men," Most stylish super-hero flick since Blade...
","...and of course it would be, the X-Men wear leather suits!  The story focuses on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a mutant being recruited to the X-Men (a trained mutant super-hero team) by Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart).  Their enemy: Magneto (Ian McKellan), an all-powerful mutant who is trying to end all human life in America.X-Men not only makes a good action movie, but a highly-emotional drama. Wolverine is confused about his past, Rogue (Anna Paquin) is confused about her future, the entirety of this movie isn't action, but drama.Great, stylish comic book film, 8/10.",Null,0,0,3 July 2003
Sleepy Hollow," 'Sleepy Hollow' defines good horror
","Dr. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the dark town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the beheadings of different townees.  There, he - and others - are attacked by the headless ghost of a vicious horseman (Christopher Walken).Each and every dreary, dark scene in 'Sleepy Hollow' scares you.  The suspense is thrilling and the jumps are scarier then ever.  Director Tim Burton's fusion dark comedy and gruesome horror bring one word to mind: masterpiece.Probably the greatest thing about this film is the shading.  Burton fades almost all colour, causing fleshtones to whiten and skies to become grey. This gives 'Sleepy Hollow' that creepy gothic feel that everyone loves.scary horror, 7.5/10.",Null,1,1,3 July 2003
Hotel Rwanda," Inspiring storytelling of a tragic, heroic man
","'Hotel Rwanda'.Paul Rusesabagina is a regular man. He is happily married with a nice wife, Tatia (Sophie Okonedo), and has a few pleasant young children. He works as a manager to the hotel Milles Collines in his small native country of Rwanda. He is a good manager, a smart one, knowing when and how to bribe the right people for better business. When asked why he spends four hundred Francs on a Cuban cigar, he answers that four hundred francs to a businessman is nothing, but a Cuban cigar for a businessman is style. And style means good business.Paul is of the Hutu tribe, which was ruled over by the Tutsi in Rwanda for a long time. The Tutsi killed many Hutu, and now that the Hutu are in power there are rumors that they are planning on striking back. Paul is not interested politics though, Hutu and Tutsi are no different to him, his wife being a Tutsi is proof of that. Paul just wants to run his hotel with a minimum of interruptions or trouble.But the trouble comes to his door one night. He comes home from work to learn that Tutsi terrorists have murdered the peace-wanting Hutu president of Rwanda. Hutus around the country are going crazy, killing all the Tutsi they can find. A crowd of Tutsi have taken refuge in Paul's house. He is uneasy. His son is missing, looking for a Tutsi friend. Paul finds the child, drenched in blood. It's not his own blood, but Paul disintegrates nonetheless. Indeed, the man has been hiding his fear.When Hutu military soldiers travel the country, murdering and murdering the Tutsi they call 'cockroaches' Paul does the only thing he can offer to do: he hides wanted Tutsis in his hotel. Helping him is a desperate Canadian UN Colonel (Nick Nolte) who has been practically abandoned by the rest of the world in this small, conflicted country. The Colonel, named Oliver, has all of three men and a few trucks at his disposal; he has a deep need to save these lives, but his orders are restricting.So the bulk of the movie shows these two men doing all they can to save as many lives as possible. There is a close situation every day, soldiers and terrorists are continually showing up at the hotel door, and food and drink is running out. Paul and Oliver use all of their strength to think fast, bribe, make phone calls, and otherwise improvise their way out of danger. Paul is losing it, watching the bloodshed around him. He is desperate. They all are.Paul is played by Don Cheadle, that actor best known for ironic or violent side roles in crime comedies. He's given quite a few great performances, my favorite being his role as the psychotic 'Snoopy' in Steven Soderbergh's 'Out of Sight'. That was a performance worthy of an Oscar. But here Cheadle gives his best performance yet, his character, though frightened and frustrated, is full of such warmth, heart, kindness and strength. This man is a hero, but not in the traditional action-hero, long-speech type way. He is a man pushed into a corner with a thousand lives behind him, doing his best to think his way out. This performance will hopefully get Cheadle the recognition he's always deserved.Nolte and newcomer Okonedo are also in top form; this is Nolte's best performance since 'Affliction' and Okonedo, well, I hope to see her in the future. Her character symbolizes Paul's hope, his love, and his humanity. She is a believable wife too, and her reaction to one of Paul's decisions later in the movie is sort of heartbreaking.A few scenes that don't work, I must say, are some romantic moments between Paul and Tatia. They sort of break the mood and I'm not too sure if they'd have a candle-lit, rooftop dinner when death is at hand. Also, I think the movie needed a little more  and I hate to say it  violence. An R rating would've suited it, I think, because it would've shown us the weight of Paul's deed, what he was rescuing the Tutsi lives from.You hardly think of this while watching though. The movie is all about the strength  and evil  of humanity, the importance of lives and the hardships of survival. It's also about a husband and father's love for his family, and about one of the Western world's greatest sins, turning away from Rwanda. It's about a lot of things.8/10.",Null,1,1,13 January 2005
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Quite the entertaining western adventure...
","...'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as, well, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, two train/bank robbers who are in trouble with the law, the railroad company, and a possey led by an expert tracker.  Cassidy and Sundance exchange fire with the possey, leap from tall waterfalls and much more in this great comic adventure.The most notable part of 'Butch' is definitely the screen-writing.  William Goldman also pleased with 'All the President's Men' and 'The Princess Bride' among others.  His comic, yet exciting way of writing his adventures that puts him on my list as one of the best screenwriters of all time.Of course, the performances are very well-done too.  Newman is cool and smooth as Butch, but Redford's Sundance would be my favorite character.  His quiet, calm way of acting in dangerous situations makes him as loved as similar characters (i.e.: Mr. Blonde from Reservoir Dogs, Tom Reagan from Miller's Crossing).Everyone loves this western, and for no bad reason, 8/10.",Null,0,2,30 September 2003
Crash," Brilliant in every, single way
","Well, isn't this quite the movie. Uh-huhevery year, in my opinion, a movie is released that is made just perfectly. Made perfectlymeaning all of the acting, all of the writing, all of the directing, the music, the cinematography, the editing, the plot, story, all that, is just perfect. Last year that movie was 'Collateral'. The year before that it was 'In America'. This year, it is Paul Haggis' 'Crash'.The film tells the stories of ten or so different people whose lives intersect over a forty-eight hour period, between two car accidents in LA. There's Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner-girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Esposito) investigating the seemingly accidental shooting of a black cop, DA Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his neurotic wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), a TV director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton), two cops  one racist (Matt Dillon), one gallant (Ryan Phillippe); an Iranian convenience store owner (Shaun Toub); two college-aged black men (Ludicrous and Larenz Tate) and the innocent, victimized locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena).Some of them have connections with others when the movie begins, but by the end they'll all more or less be connected by the prejudices and judgments that they store in their hearts over years of ignored ignorance. As the most interesting character in the movie puts it: 'You think you know who you are? You have no idea'by the end of the film, all of the main characters are at least starting to learn who they are.How? Well, to give away even the smallest detail may spoil the experience, but let's just say that a lot of the characters meet through accidents, crashes if you will. A lot depends on coincidence, a lot on behavior, and a lot on prejudice. But everyone learns.Ensemble movies like this are done a lot, I guess, but it always feels fresh and new when they're done so well, like with 1999's 'Magnolia'. This movie is clearer and more bearable than 'Magnolia', which was a masterpiece in itself. It just so perfectly captures human nature  none of the characters are completely innocent, and none are one hundred percent guilty, either. This is shown perfectly in the characters of the two cops, through developments that I will not give away, but I will say that they are both brilliantly emotional and suspenseful.And yes, the movie is suspenseful. It shouldn't be one of those 'boring dramas' that action-and-stupid-comedy buffs seem to avoid. This is a movie that could draw anyone in, because everybody can find a piece of their soul somewhere in it.Its qualities stretch far beyond themethis is an ensemble piece, an ensemble of talent. Writer director Paul Haggis has been around since the early nineties I guess, but with this so soon after his Oscar-nominated script for 'Million Dollar Baby', I'm seeing him as a new talent. And he's good. If he plays his cards right he'll be able to ride the Hollywood horse in the way Spielberg and Tarantino are doing it right now.And the acting  oh, the acting! It's superb, it's marvelous, every actor knows the soul of their character, and plays it excellently (even Ludicrous, who might just have an acting career ahead of him, unlike a lot of his rapper peers). Now everyone was good, make no mistake, but let me point out a few who were justextraordinary. Matt Dillon ranks in at number one, as the fierce, racist cop, who we hate from the start, but come to understand by the end. Sure, when he explains the roots of his prejudices, we roll our eyes, but imagine walking in his shoes? And he has a scene that will be remembered. And there's Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton as the black married couple, who each face prejudice on their own and together, and seeing them interact we thinkyes, this is a marriage. I knew Newton was great, but Howard is a bit of a surprise herea good surprise, he's more talented than I might've thought at first, and this is his performance. An Oscar, I say! Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Pena, Shaun Toub, Brendan Fraser, William Fitchner, Keith David, Tony Danza and Sandra Bullock all pop up in a few scenes or more, and they each leave a great impression. People like Tony Danza and Sandra Bullock seemed like a lost cause, but they do have talentthey've just been hiding it for a while. It's expertly displayed here.Basically, I can't think of a single reason for anyone of a mature age not to see this movie. It's greatone of the year's best.9/10",9,1,7,8 June 2005

Behind it is Dr. Strangelove (Sellers) and defending the human race are the U.S. President (Sellers) and Ripper's officer Mandrake (Sellers).

Alien," Good, but not as good as the sequel...
","...for most cases I have trouble saying that the sequel is better than the original because the original is the reason that the sequel was made, but 'Alien' just isn't as suspenseful as 'Aliens'.  The story focuses on Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and the crew of her ship, the Nostromo, battling an unusual alien which is lost on board.  The rest of the crew consists of captain Dallas (Tom Skerrit), sinister scientist Ash (Ian Holm), Kane (John Hurt), Parker (Yaphet Kotto), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) and Brett (Harry Dean Stanton).The main problem with 'Alien' is that there are just too few characters to create an intense, hostile atmosphere - like the sequel.  Dallas is a conceited annoying hack and Ripley is a whiner.  Also, Kane is killed off too early and Lambert and Brett are just...boring.  Although, Holm plays Ash wonderfully, and same goes for Kotto as the careless Parker.Of course, I would have to consider that the film was made in 1979, and from a technical aspect, it's perfect.  The alien costume looks incredibly realistic - even better than some of the CGI we see in movies today.  And there are some suspenseful scenes, including Dallas' searching for the alien in an air duct and Ripley's climactic battle with the alien.Don't get me wrong, 'Alien' doesn't disappoint, but it lacks in hard suspense, 8/10.",Null,0,1,28 July 2003
The Polar Express," Have an incredible Christmas!
","The problem with Christmas movies is: they're generally  I mean, usually  made to make money. My point is, the producers/directors/writers/actors are often making the rounds on these ones  they don't pay much attention to what they're doing (example: 'Christmas with the Kranks'). They don't care.'The Polar Express' really cares about itself. It's got a long, beautiful story that it dares tell children and adult alike about. It is a film full of the kind of simple wonder, joy and magic that I thought was all but gone for years. It doesn't need to tell a story of complexities, violence or conflict for the children to be interested. All it needs to do for that is to give the kids wonder, and does it ever.The story, though much expanded upon from the book, is still quite simple: a boy (known as Hero Boy) who is losing his faith in the existence of Santa Clause is  along with many other children  taken to the North Pole to see how it's all done. Of course the movie wouldn't be half as interesting if it was without their means of transportation: the Polar Express.The Polar Express is a massive steam engine which runs on both coal and Santa's magic. It is run by a flesh-and-blood conductor (Tom Hanks) and a couple of engine men, though the rest of the staff seems to materialize in (and out) of thin air when they're needed. For instance, when the conductor orders cocoa for the children a group of waiters leap into the car, pour their drinks, sing and dance, and are gone in a flash. Another instance of the train's magic is when Hero Girl's (Hero Boy's new friend) ticket flies out of the window and various parts of the environment (animals, wind) cause it to catch up with the train. Seeing this in 3-D was amazing.There are many other scenes of pure spectacle, as when the train skids over ice, or when Hero Boy and a strange hobo who lives on top of the train (Tom Hanks) race to an empty car before being crushed by the oncoming tunnel. These are very exciting, energetic, fun, and visually stunning action scenes, and require no violence either.The film keeps its supply of wonder and energy for the entire ride of the Polar Express, but when the train rolls into the North Pole, it slows down just a little bit. I think this may be because the Pole is already so familiar to us, too familiar for a few small adjustments to change. The Pole still looks nice, with its thousands of elves and its small buildings and toy factories (it looks more like hard work than jolly fun), but we've seen it all before, too many times. Still, this is probably the best envisioning on screen that I've seen.And probably also the best envisioning of Santa himself. Played by Tom Hanks, this Santa seems like a real man, warm and kind though with a no-nonsense voice, who reacts to his job and requirements like a real person might. His entrance is one of the most memorable parts in the movie, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed Hanks' 'performances' in the film. Of his three most significant characters I would say the Hobo is my favorite, just because he's so eccentric and original, but The Conductor and Santa are right behind.Another thing, my mother said she didn't like how the movie was devoid of spirituality, but I disagree, I think it was all right there on the screen. I mean, when The Conductor says that life's best things cannot be 'seen'well, what else could he mean? So, it was a great film. A spectacle. It should be seen by every family. I suggest you see it in 3-D, because it is amazing that way, and you had better hurry. But I have a feeling they will play this every few years, at least, in the IMAX, so children decades from now will still be able to catch the experience of one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made.8/10",8,2,4,2 January 2005
Closer," One of the year's best, a must-see, entertaining and harrowing
","'Closer' is a character study looking closely  like through a magnifying glass  at the dishonesty of human nature. Its only four characters are real. These are people. Adjectives like 'convincing' or 'believable' aren't applicable here because they are irrelevant...whether these are actors or not, 'Closer' is a look at a few years in the lives of four very real people. They are four fierce, empathy-less, angry, sad, charming, and sometimes even sick people, but they are still people, and not mere characters in a movie. When the film ends their problems are not solved, their lives will still continue the way it does through the film, because it is a film on life, and life doesn't end until death, and this isn't about the people's deaths.Dan (Jude Law) is a pretty bad-boy wannabe English writer who goes through his days pretending to have a dark side. Anna (Julia Roberts) is a classy photographer who takes seemingly artistic photos of strangers that look personal but only hide the fact that they are, indeed, strangers. Alice (Natalie Portman) is a dark free spirit who is both cynical and naive. Larry (Clive Owen) is a dermatologist who fuses an innocent boyish charm with fierce anger and hatred for other human beings. All four can be nasty, or lovable. They have traits. People.Dan meets Alice on the street. They engage in a flirtation, speaking about themselves, attracted. They become partners, live together for a year or so, Dan writes a book based on her. They appear to be in love, but really it is about how they each meet the other's required needs.Then Dan finds someone who will meet his needs more sufficiently. Anna, the photographer, taking his picture for the jacket of his book. Anna likes him, but doesn't want to be a 'thief'. Still, she gives in and can't help but kiss him. She thinks to remain strong, though, and rejects him.Retaliating to the rejection, Dan signs onto a dirty internet chat room, posing as Anna, and sets up a meeting with Larry. Larry comes to the London aquarium Anna so often visits, and finds the real Anna there. He sits down beside her and immediately sets off a bunch of piggish, chauvinistic sexual comments. She's put off by him, but not as much as she should be, and when they both realize his dilemma she instantly forgives him. They go for a walk. Larry's gears switch instantly from obnoxious pervert to boyish charmer, and we, along with Anna, start to like him.And so the movie is set up, and things happen from here on in, not as predictable as you might think. The four characters interact, sometimes one-on-one, sometimes in threesomes, never all four at once. The movie has that 'play feel'. Sometimes that feel doesn't work ('Mister Roberts' for example) but sometimes it works perfectly. The latter applies here. We feel like we have stepped into the peoples' lives, the same feeling we usually get from a good play.The screenplay was adapted by Patrick Marber from his own play, and it is directed by Mike Nichols. These two really know how to set up a movie. An Oscar for both of them would be an understatement. All of the aspects  mostly acting and writing  piece together to make the perfect tone for the film. Everything justfits. The film editing is commendable too, like a scene where both couples are breaking up, and it inter-cuts between them. Another brilliant move was to save Jude Law and Clive Owen's meeting until a climactic later scene, because these two are the driving chauvinist males of the movie, and anything less significant wouldn't do them justice.This is an ensemble piece. Not in the usual 'ensemble piece' way  meaning that there are many famous faces jammed in the same shot  but meaning that all of the cast (which here is only four) play off each other perfectly. There is romantic, angry, sexual, sad, charming and sympathetic chemistry firing between them at all times; the actors have developed an actual relationship with each other that sort of resonates in the film.Natalie Portman is magical in this movie. She delivers one of the best female performances of the year, playing a beautiful, spunky character that ambiguously has the odds on her side. We don't often her side of things, but when we do, it's a shocker. She deserved the Golden Globe she won and would deserve the Oscar (I place only Virginia Madsen before her).Clive Owen proves his talent here, and proves that he is one of the most intriguing actors working today. He is stunningly able to shift from nasty to charming to perverted without seeming to be over (or under) acting, out of character or incapable. He is very capable. He grabs a hold of the audience in his scenes and doesn't let go until he's off-screen.It is because of the amazing talent and presence of Portman and Owen that we sort of lose focus on Jude Law and Julia Roberts, who both do terrific jobs. Jude Law raises the specter on versatility here; I suggest you watch this with 'Cold Mountain' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' to drink in what this guy can do. Roberts is movie-star, and being one, subtlety is usually not present in her performances, but here it blooms. She uses it to suggest that her character is giving way to her desires, letting go of any morals or ethics. It's a touching, tragic performance. Possibly her best.Now, the unabashed sexual dialogue may put off a few, but this is not a movie that glorifies sex, not by far. So watch it, no matter if you're a conservative or liberal, and study the values of empathy, honesty and the wisdom to not make the same mistakes twice.8.5/10",8,1,1,24 January 2005
Lost in Translation," Second only to The Lord of the Rings, this is the best movie of the year!
","'Lost in Translation' is Sofia Coppola's second film.  Her first was 1999's 'The Virgin Suicides', which was a really great film...but it was super depressing, and didn't really make one want to watch it again.  Her second film, on the other hand, is a masterwork of inspiring romance, drama and comedy.  The story centers on Bob Harris (Bill Murray), a fading B-movie star who meets Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a young woman while the two are staying at the same hotel for a few weeks in Japan.Everything about this movie is wonderfully beautiful.  The acting, the locations, the writing, the cinematography, the direction...everything.  The story is so subtle in it's brilliance, it teaches a lot about life and love, and everyone should listen.The acting is also great.  Sure, we only really get to know Bob and Charlotte, but Murray and Johansson do so amazingly well.  By the end of the movie, you want to cry.  The Oscars made a very just decision nominating Murray (hopefully he'll win) and a very unjust one in forgetting Johansson. She goes all out and gets so into character...and really, am I suppose to believe that Diane Keaton did a better job in 'Something's Gotta Give'? Maybe if Johansson took her top off...'Lost in Translation' is the only movie this year that I wouldn't mind if it beat 'Lord of the Rings', a great film, I give it two thumbs up, four stars, and 8.5/10.",10,0,1,19 February 2004
The Godfather: Part II," De Niro makes 'The Godfather: Part II' better than the original...
","...'The Godfather: Part II' is probably the best sequel ever made.  As you all probably know, the story is cut in two: one half focuses on Michael Corleone's (Al Pacino) battle to keep his power in the crime syndicate and the second focuses on Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) - the character played by Marlon Brando in the original - and his rise to power in America.  Both stories are done very well, but in the end the latter is more interesting. As everyone knows, Brando did a great performance and created a memorable character in the original, and it is very entertaining to watch De Niro give it a try.  Except after watching this film some may agree that De Niro did a better job.Unfortunately, Michael's story suffers from the loss of James Caan's character, Sonny Corleone.  He spiced up the first very much, and it truly is disappointing to see him disappear from the second.  Of course, Pacino still does an amazingly memorable (and villainous) performance.  The supporting players, consisting of Tom (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Bruno Kirby), Kay (Diane Keaton), Frankie (Michael V. Gazzo) and Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) also do well.Coppola scored big on this one, and De Niro and Pacino make it even better, 9/10.",Null,0,1,19 August 2003
Fargo," Should have been more intense...
","...with crime movies like Fargo, the thing that usually makes them great is how intense they are.  Fargo isn't intense, it's just too cute.  It's like a children's film disguised as a crime tragedy.  Sure, there are some suspenseful parts, but there weren't enough.Overall it was still a good movie, the acting was grade A from Frances McDormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.Despite McDormand's great performance, I'd have to say my favorites were by the three criminals: William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Macy makes you feel sorry for him as the man reluctantly having his wife kidnapped, he really portrays the 'too stupid for his own good' thing.Buscemi is basically playing Mr. Pink again, but just a little less nervous as the talkative amateur crook Carl Showalter.  Though, Buscemi being my favorite actor, I still thought his role was great.  Stormare's acting wasn't really the best, but he was believable as the quiet but violent bad guy.Good movie, entertaining at least, 7.5/10.",Null,0,0,29 June 2003
The Aviator," Brilliant, sad
","Martin Scorsese's 'The Aviator' is the tragic story of how a man's grand genius practically destroys his mind. It's also a glorious homage to the golden years of Hollywood, and to a man's strength in expanding upon his empire, defeating his criticizers and, most of the time, winning.The man is Howard Hughes, infamous movie and airplane mogul who got his start directing 'Hell's Angels' in the late twenties. The movie opens here, with Hughes begging for just two more cameras, so that he can have twenty-six instead of a mere twenty-four to make the big climactic dogfight scene. Once he succeeds and the movie is nearly done, but then 'The Jazz Singer' is released and Hughes decides to re-shoot the entire movie in sound. His assistant Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) is skeptical. Everyone is skeptical. Hughes ignores them and does it anyway.These beginning scenes have a breakneck pace and involve Hugh emptying his pockets over and over again. To everyone else this seems like a plan to go broke, but Hughes sees things in the long run, knowing that if 'Hell's Angels' is made with sound, more people will see it, more times. He is wise, and knows his plans will pull through in the end; it's his high-strung, nervous demeanor that puts everyone else off.After 'Hell's Angels' Hughes switches from making movies to making airplanesfast, revolutionary airplanes. He makes his planes the same way he makes his movies: dozens of last minute improvements, mind-changing, and lots and lots of money loss. He remains confident; it is his stubbornness and ego that drive him to his accomplishments.But he has a problem, one few know about. It is severe OCD, though I don't think the phrase had been coined yet. Because of some scarring episodes with his mother when he was a child Howard goes through the rest of his life worrying a lot about germs. Since he is an inherited millionaire he is able to feed his worries: people accept it when he asks for one steak and exactly six peas.Meanwhile he manages to balance this with a life of womanizing. Hughes was famous for dating many successful actresses, of which Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) are seen most in the film.Cate Blanchett does not significantly resemble Hepburn  she probably wouldn't be the first to come to mind for the part  but after seeing her in it I can't imagine anyone else in the part. She is perfectthis girl can act. For anyone else it would be an impersonation but for Blanchett it's a performance. Her scenes are wonderfulthe presence of Hepburn in the movie is not used as a gimmick or a cameo, but as an actual part of the film, a significant part of Hughes' life. She has some very heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes, her performance is a delight, richly deserving her Oscar nomination (and maybe a win too).Indeed, since most of the cast are playing celebrities, it opens it up for them to overact or impersonate their characters, but all of the actors hit just the right note, like Kate Beckinsale as the proud Gardner or Jude Law showing up as the gaudy, obnoxious Errol Flynn. Alec Baldwin and Alan Alda play Hughes foremost enemies: scheming Panam head Juan Trippe and Brewster, the senator that Trippe has bought.Both Baldwin and Alda have excellent scenes where they try to play off of Hughes' OCD to throw him off during negotiations: one where Trippe speaks to Hughes through an office room door and blows his pipe smoke through the keyhole into the room and another where during a dinner Brewster places a fingertip on Hughes' glass while serving him nearly raw fish. Hughes reacts to both these situations in a different way, but he is always desperately trying to maneuver himself out from under the schemes of those plotting against him.Hughes does a different kind of maneuvering, in the scenes where his money pays off (or doesn't) when he flies his planes. One scene in particular, is stunning, when Hughes takes his newest plane for a ride, breaks a speed record, but loses control over Beverly Hills. It would be a sin for me to spoil what happens, but I can say that it is an exciting, scary thrill of a scene.Martin Scorsese directs excellently, this is one of his best films. Many of his films take place over a span of many decades, but this is the first one I've seen that captures these periods so beautifully. The cinematography is wonderful, filming each decade the way movies were filmed then (just, with colour), not a gimmick but a smart way of creating a flow. Most films are either all style or all substance, but Scorsese is one of the few who can meld them both into an emotionally and visually intriguing film.Oh, and Howard Hughes is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, not the first actor you'd think of (like, say, Jason Robards). He doesn't look like the man, no, but why should that be an issue with acting? DiCaprio masters the mannerisms, the glory and the madness. It is a magnificent performance, one that takes a person who was a potential genius and follows him through his life. The film ends on the perfect note, which pretty much sums up the remainder of Hughes life. It is a film to see.8.5/10.",9,1,3,25 January 2005
American Pie," Hardy har har, how hilarious...yeah...right...
","...'American Pie' is the kind of movie for that kid in third grade who'd shout out 'Sex!' because he thought the word was funny.  Honestly, every joke in this movie is just a slightly different variation of shouting out 'Sex!'.  Please, I don't call that funny, I call it elementary.The story focuses on Jim (Jason Biggs), Oz (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a bunch of teens who all vow to lose their virginity by prom night.  They do this because Chuck Sherman (Chris Owen), an annoying loser, claims he lost his virginity before them. Unfortunately it is so obvious that Chuck is lying that anyone who was actually surprised by this near the end wasn't paying attention.  Of course, it's hard to pay attention to a movie like this.The only thing worse than the movie though was the acclaim it got.  A few years after it first came out I heard my friends (I use that term loosely) making the same vow.  Unfortunately, these kids were thirteen.  If 'American Pie' is inspiring pre-teens to impregnate other pre-teens, and is famous for it, well,  that shows you what kind of world we're living in.If you have any substance to your character than please, stay away, 4/10.",Null,2,4,16 August 2003
The Italian Job," 'Ocean's Eleven' on wheels...
","...'The Italian Job' stars Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron as Charlie and Stella, a pair of thieves trying to get back at Stella's father's killer (Edward Norton) by stealing his gold.  Helping them are Lyle 'The Napster' (Seth Green), 'Handsome Rob' (Jason Statham) and 'Left Ear' (Mos Def).You can be sure that the producers remade this film after 'Ocean's Eleven''s success, but unfortunately, 'The Italian Job' lacks the style of the 2001 remake.  Sure, the writers give their characters 'cool' nicknames that are explained in brief flashback sequences.  Lyle claims he invented Napster, but it was stolen from him.  Left Ear lost the hearing in his right ear because he set off too many explosions as a child.  Handsome Rob is, well, handsome.  Unfortunately the nicknames just don't cut it.  Everything from the wardrobe to the background music in 'Ocean's Eleven' was cool, but 'The Italian Job' tried too hard.Still, it managed to be a very fun and funny movie.  The wisecracks from Left Ear and Handsome Rob are hilarious at times, and every word that comes out of Seth Green's mouth is amusing (as always).  The action is good too, involving tiny cars known as Mini Coopers racing through streets and subways.The acting is probably the low point, but nothing as bad as 'Gigli' or 'From Justin to Kelly'.  The best performances probably come from the three side characters played by Green, Statham and Def.  Unfortunately, Edward Norton's character is both annoying and boring, something you wouldn't expect from such a great actor.All in all, 'The Italian Job' was an exceptionally fun movie, but nothing more, 7.5/10.",7,1,2,2 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Very, VERY few movies reach this epic!
","'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is by far one of the greatest movies ever made.  There is so much drama, so many great performances that will keep this film alive for the ages.The story focuses on hobbit Frodo (Elijah Wood).  Frodo is given a magic ring from his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm), and soon finds out that this ring holds the evil of distant warlord Sauron.  Wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan) tells him this, and sends him on a secretive mission to Sauron's homeland, Mordor, to destroy the ring.  Helping him are such colorful characters as human Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom).Every performance goes beyond A+.  From McKellan's gruff, grandfatherly (and Oscar nominated) Gandalf to Mortensen's grim, quiet Aragorn.The high point of drama, as many would agree, would be when Gandalf faces off against and evil creature known as the 'Balrog'.  You can see anger, fear and strength in McKellan's face, proving what a terrific actor he is. I don't know how well Jim Broadbent did in 'Iris', but it must have been amazing to beat McKellan.'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is one great cinematic step, and the start of a classic, epic trilogy, 8.5/10.",8,0,0,16 July 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Entertaining and exciting sequel to a visually stunning series...
","...'The Matrix Revolutions' is the last installment of one of the greatest action series of all time.  This time around the plot focuses on Neo's (Keannu Reeves) search for answers, the war between Zion and the machines and the evil Agent Smith's (Hugo Weaving) growing power.  All the while it is filled with action, adventure and excitement.Ever since 'Reloaded' reviewers and people alike have been complaining about how disappointing the series has become.  I disagree with them completely. The first Matrix was thrilling and new, the second was fun and full of mystery, the third is nail-biting excitement and full of answers.  I don't think 'Revolutions' could have ended the series any better than it did.There are still flaws, of course, but only minor.  A few cheesy scenes of dialogue, Keannu Reeves' acting, and (spoiler!) some bad drama in the killing of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), but the pros outweigh the cons.  This is an action movie, and that's how it delivers.  From the fire-scorched battle scenes in Zion to Neo's climactic fight with Agent Smith to Seraph's (Colin Chou, in the coolest role of the movie) greater importance, this never disappoints.That said, I still have to say that anyone going to the theater shouldn't expect anything as good as the first, or anything really powerful and dramatic, just an intensely fun and exciting action movie.  And the gunfight between Morpheus, Trinity, Seraph and The Merovingian's thugs...well, it doesn't get much better!I'm disappointed with its low rating (6.5), but I think I know that it will climb up in the near future, 8/10",10,0,0,6 November 2003
The Thing," Only 'monster' movie to actually scare me!
","When it comes to monster movies (i.e.: Alien, Predator) I'm usually very hard to scare, but when I saw 'The Thing' for the first time, I almost had to hide under a blanket (no joke!).  Between all of the gore and jumps, anyone who isn't scared when watching this movie is not even close to being a coward.The plot circles around a group of scientists at a base in Antarctic who find out that they are in the midst of an alien invasion, after one of their dogs sort of freaks out.  They figure out that the aliens 'hide' inside the humans and other living things, and each starts getting paranoid as to which one(s) of them may be a host.The result?  An intense, suspenseful thrill-ride where you never lose your attention!  Oh, and another gem that I can't not mention is the makeup.  For a move made in 1982 the makeup is stunning, and much more realistic looking then most CGI these days.Great scary movie, 8/10.",Null,0,1,29 June 2003
Armageddon," Has all the ingredients of a good action movie...
","...that's exactly what this is: an ACTION movie.  It's not supposed to sweep the Oscars, the acting isn't supposed to be perfect, and it's not supposed to make perfect sense.The story follows a group of oil drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid that will strike the world in eighteen days.  The drillers are taught and trained to become astronauts (in a very comedic scene) and then sent to the asteroid to drop the nukes and blow it up.  After that, a whole lot goes wrong.I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless action'.  It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic.  The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good job.Bruce Willis captures the 'reluctant hero' role, and Liv Tyler does well as his daughter.  Steve Buscemi delivers a great comedic performance as the genius who goes insane once they land on the asteroid.Great, funny, intense, dramatic movie.  8/10.",Null,147,226,29 June 2003
The Village," Aside from Bryce Dallas Howard's stunning debut, this is a major letdown from Shyamalan, definitely his worst
","Before I start let me just say that I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan. 'The Sixth Sense' was the most frightening movie experience I've ever had, 'Unbreakable' had a terrific slow buildup to a glorious climax and ending (with great performances too) and with 'Signs', his best movie, he created wonderfully realistic characters before getting into the horror parts of the story. He is one of the most interesting filmmakers today, and one of the best thriller directors in decades.Reading this you might think my expectations for 'The Village' were highthey weren't. The movie was already spoiled for me, which doesn't necessarily ruin it (I knew the endings of both 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' and still thoroughly enjoyed them) and I heard many negative reviews, including my idol Roger Ebert's one-star review of the film. I had low expectations; it was about as bad as I thought it'd be.This is a disappointment, because I thought the story was intriguing when I first heard of it, and the trailer sent shivers down my spine. The plot takes place in 1989, in a village surrounded by a forest. No one dares to enter the forest because of 'Those We Do Not Speak Of', fierce creatures that, until we first see them, all we know about them is that they're 'big' (naturally, of course, seeing that they're not supposed to speak of them). For the first hour or so we mostly get to know the characters and their stories. There's the leader Edward Walker (William Hurt), his blind daughter Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the boy she loves, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver), who has feelings for Edward. Oh, and the retarded Noah (Adrien Brody) who prances around the village and also loves Ivy.Before I start into my major quibbles I'll just mention a few things that annoyed me. Shyamalan has filled his script with a lot of extra crap to make it soundwell, cooler, I guess. The creatures  which could very well have been called 'The Creatures'  are instead called 'Those We Don't Speak Of', though no one in the village ever has any reluctance or fear in mentioning them (this is clear in an early scene in a school classroom, when young children talk about them with Edward and no one seems to mind). Also, the 'bad colour' that supposedly attracts the creatures and the 'safe colour', whichdoesn't, I guess, have little relevance to the plot.What bothered me the most is how all the characters spoke! They talk like someone (someone very young) would think 1800s people would talk like. Edward Walker takes an eternity to make a point because of all the pseudo-1800s crap Shyamalan shoves in. In the end this kind of makes sense (kind of) but that doesn't make the journey there any less excruciating on the ears.Some subplots were also pointless and dull, like Alice's romance (or lack thereof) with Edward. She likes him, he apparently likes her, they have a brief scene together near the end, but their whole story is never cleared up.The acting is another low point, most of the time anyway. Joaquin Phoenix has a great scene with Bryce Dallas Howard and an interesting character, which could've made quite a hero, but because of a plot element which I won't spoil her becomes seriously underused. Brendan Gleeson and Judy Greer  as Ivy's sister  were also underused. William Hurt has a big part, but his dialogue is the absolute worst. There's a point where he delivers a big speech, and his facial expression and voice are great, but his lines are terrible, so it's hard to admire it. I was also surprised that Sigourney Weaver was so confident about the movie in interviews, because on screen she looks terribly uncertain as to whether she's in a good movie or not. Oh, and I once thought that any actor could play a retarded person marginally wellAdrien Brody proved me wrong here.There is one fantastic performance here, and that's from first-timer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) as Ivy. She has the energy and confidence that the other cast members lack, and somehow manages to get all the best lines. She plays blind perfectly, and when she cries we think it's her crying, not the script. I look forward to her next film role.A lot of people are complaining about the end twist of the movie. There are about three, one was surprising, one was clever and well executed, and one was aggravating, but it didn't have to be. You see, in 'Signs' Shyamalan spent the bulk of the film setting up his characters and their situation, how the aliens would affect them, before moving to the horror scenes, like the terrifying scene in the dark cellar. He seems to be doing the same thing in 'The Village', but just when you think the horror stuff will start, something happens that will pretty much prevent the rest of the movie from being scary.I think Shyamalan thought he was making a terrific horror film because he focused more on the characters and their stories, with the horror story as more of a subplot. Problem is, the characters weren't all that interesting, except for Ivy, and the horror parts weren't scary, except for one small jump. What 'The Village' needed was just a little more focus on the creatures, making them scarier and not campy (I laughed when I first saw 'Those We Don't Speak Of').But, I'm willing to forgive; after all, every director has a stinker here and there. I'll look forward to Shyamalan's next film, 6.5/10.",Null,0,0,22 August 2004
American Beauty," Very interesting, funny and original take on family life...
","...'American Beauty' tells the touching tale of the last year of Lester Burnham's (Kevin Spacey) life.  At the start of the movie, Lester lives with his wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) and his daughter Jane (Thora Birch) and is basically invisible.  His wife ignores him and his daughter hates him, and he can't do anything about it.  Except, one night he meets Jane's friend Angela (Mena Suvari) and decides to turn his life around.  He quits work, starts working out, and buys pot from the boy next door (Wes Bentley).  This angers Carolyn and freaks out Jane, and eventually leads to Lester's death (don't worry, that wasn't a spoiler).The two best performances in 'American Beauty' are that of Spacey as Lester and Bening as Carolyn.  Spacey is funny and laid back, and a delight to watch on screen.  Bening, though going a little 'over the top' with her performance, also does very well.  The ensemble cast makes this not only one of the best dramas out there, but one of the funniest and most entertaining movies of all time.The only disappointment I had with the movie are the nude scenes from Birch and Suvari.  They both just seem a little unnecessary, and could have been avoided easily.  It seems that they were only put in to attract the hordes of teen boys that would just love to see Suvari nude.Aside from the nude scenes, 'American Beauty' is a great watch, 9/10.",Null,0,1,19 August 2003
Apocalypse Now," Amazing drama, but shouldn't be considered a war film
","'Saving Private Ryan' is a war film.  'Windtalkers' is a war film.  'Pearl Harbor' is a (bad) war film.  'Apocalypse Now' isn't a war movie, its a graphic drama about a man's personal journey that takes place during a war (and a good one at that).'Apocalypse Now' amazes you, from Martin Sheen's sad performance to Marlon Brando's equally sad performance.  Both actors have great chemistry, and it sparks whenever they're on screen together.  Laurence Fishburne is good as the young soldier, and Dennis Hopper is funny and entertaining as the photo journalist.Ironically, the only actor who delivers a bad performance is Robert Duvall. All he does is yell.  In every scene he's in, all he ever does is yell.  I don't have the faintest clue why he was nominated for an Oscar, and others who delivered better performances than him (i.e.: Dennis Hopper) weren't.Aside from Duvall's hammy performance, this is a great drama about one man's journey of personal discovery.  I recommend it to anyone, 8.5/10.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
The White Ribbon," A great movie, but for who?
","When I say that 'The White Ribbon' is a great movie, I mean, only, that it's a movie made by a great director. And when I refer to Michael Haneke as a great director, all I'm really saying is, the man knows what he's doing. He's no hack.My problem – or, I should say, my issue – is with exactly that: what he's doing. If I seem ambivalent or undecided about this review, it's only because that's how I felt about the movie. It's a mystery/drama about a town on the Austrian countryside right before WWI. It has the appearance of a regular, idyllic town, but, some really bad things start happening. People start getting hurt, when no one else is around. It's clearly more than one person perpetrating these crimes, which start to resemble ritual punishment.So it's a mystery. But since this is a Haneke film, we know the 'mystery' is unimportant. It's about what the mystery reveals about the town. This is the same storytelling technique he used for 'Cache,' a movie that a lot of people spend a lot of time trying to figure out. I can't imagine why – the movie, like this one, offers no concrete solutions, only ambiguity, and since any definitive conclusions (about the plot) would draw too much from the viewers' imagination, and not enough from the film itself, such conclusions are rendered completely irrelevant to the film. It's sort of like the Philip Seymour Hoffman/Meryl Streep movie 'Doubt.'Now, thematic conclusions – those are abounding. And since Haneke pushes the plot so far to the side they can come off a little heavy-handed. This is my primary issue (problem?) with the craft of 'The White Ribbon.' Whereas 'Cache' focused mainly on two wonderful performances (from Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) that lent the film a certain precision, 'The White Ribbon' is about an entire town's worth of characters. Each is allotted less time, and therefore, fewer dimensions – and therefore, less precision, and morepredetermination. They come off as numbers in a thematic equation Haneke is calculating, or trying to.The 'trying to' is the part I'm back and forth on. I haven't mentioned how starkly beautiful the film is, thanks to the black and white cinematography and compositions of Christian Berger. It'll remind you of Bergmans like 'Through a Glass Darkly,' 'Winter Light' or 'Hour of the Wolf.' The film is so visually arresting, if it was Silent, I might call it a triumph. Even so, there are ways Berger (or Haneke) use their camera that disturb me, and not, I don't think, in the way they mean to.I'm sort of dancing around – I know. Let me talk about one thing that really struck me about Haneke's film: the way he depicts his 'good' characters. There are a few of them. The story is narrated by the town's resident teacher, much older, trying to make sense of the events that shaped his personal history. The younger version is played by Christian Friedel, and he's seen as ugly, weak and completely ineffectual. It's not quite his fault (it's society's!), but there is some intended frustration caused us by the character's complete inability to alter the course of his life or his town's. Another character, a farmer, is perhaps the only one in the film with a rigid code of honor he apparently lives his life by. He's got a lazy eye. There's an extended close up on his face where the focal point is the bridge of his nose, and his left eye points to the left and his right eye points to the right and he comes off as practically inhuman. Is Haneke saying to live righteously in an authoritarian society you must be a freak, or abnormal? I don't know – all I know is, if I was the actor with the lazy eye, I might be insulted.To call the film misanthropic would be overstating the point, I guess. It's about bad people. I haven't said much about what the movie's actually trying to say, because, after saying it, it seems almost pointless. 'Religious suppression and societal demand for perfection are the seeds of fascism.' There it is, more or less (read Ebert's review if you want a really meaningful dissection of the film's themes). It's the kind of thing you can sort of nod your head to, I mean; it makes enough sense within the confines of the movie. Is it an important statement on German/Austrian history or the beginnings of Nazism? I don't know enough about the history to really say.No one loves a movie, or returns to it, for what it's saying. 'Avatar' didn't gross two billion worldwide because of its metaphorical criticism of outsourced American capitalism (well, maybe in some places). It's because of the way it looked, and 'The White Ribbon' will be embraced by cineastes for the same reason, I think. It's well-made. Like I said earlier, it looks beautiful. Is it a great movie? It looks like one.SoI don't know. 7/10. I don't regret seeing it. It held my interest for the most part, if not rewarding it completely. How could it have, you ask me? I don't know. It's the right movie; it's the movie Haneke was trying to make. But I don't think I'd watch it again.",7,6,18,7 February 2010
Spider-Man," The entire movie can be described in three words: cheesy, corny and childish.
","With the little to no fight scenes, the over-acting and the terrible dialogue, 'Spider-Man''s target audience must be toddlers.  I don't understand how anybody over the age of ten can like this movie.  There is barely any action!  The best fight scene consist of Spider-Man punching someone!And the acting is so over-dramatic that it's sickening.  I am surprised that veteran actor Willem Dafoe did such a terrible job as the Green Goblin, but still, he probably delivered the best performance.  Tobey Maguire smiles goofily as if he's a four year old who is trying to get onto his uncle's camera.  Kirsten Dunst's main acting ability is to whimper, that's all she does: whimper.I am surprised that David Koepp, the screenwriter, penned such great scripts as Panic Room after this disaster.  I hate everything about this movie, it's just too childish for my likings.  You want to see a good super hero movie? See Batman Returns, not this.3.5/10.",Null,1,2,29 June 2003
Spider-Man," I would like to retract my earlier statement; 'Spider-Man' isn't all that bad...
","In my previous review of 'Spider-Man' I unfairly listed all the bad things about it and gave it a 3.5 out of 10, which is really too low a rating. Though this is by no means a great film, it's not very bad either.  The plot - obviously - focuses on Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a high school nerd, who is bitten by a radio active spider and gains spider powers.  He uses them to fight crime, make money and woo is long-time crush Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst).  Meanwhile Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) - a high-ranking millionaire/scientist - has gained some super human abilities of his own, and become 'The Green Goblin', a crazy high-flying super villain whose motives are never really made known.First I'll start by saying that when I wrote my review last year I hadn't seen many Raimi films yet, but no that I have I understand his style and the type of comedy he uses.  He's a lot like Joel and Ethan Coen, you have to recognize their entire body of work or else one movie may seem a little too odd to you.I also complained about the action, and I'm sticking too that argument. Maybe it's just me, but I hate it when all the action in a film is computer generated.  I love watching movies where I know that the actors or stuntmen really did do what's shown on screen ('Kill Bill', 'The Matrix') instead of just a guy at a desk clicking a mouse and typing keys.  Of course, there are a few exceptions - 2003's 'Hulk' for example - but 'Spider-Man' isn't one of them.  Of course, action doesn't make a film.The acting in 'Spider-Man' varies with the actors and characters.  Maguire is completely miscast as Parker, he doesn't capture the smoothness of the character of the comics.  The writing is somewhat to blame too I guess, but the way Maguire speaks his lines is just awful.  As for the others, well, like I said, it varies.  Dafoe is admirable as Osborne, he makes a good villain, and Dunst gives another great performance (the best of the movie) as MJ.  The supporting players, James Franco, J.K. Simmons, Cliff Robertson all do pretty well too.In the end this is merely an enjoyable yet mediocre super-hero film, but nothing compared to the greats ('Batman Returns', 'X-Men', 'Hulk').  The fact that it has a rating of 7.4 while the three other films I've mentioned are getting lower bugs me.  To me, this movie is a 6.5/10.",Null,1,2,30 April 2004
Collateral," The best performances yet from Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx...an excellent film
","'Collateral' features the career best performances of two seemingly different actors: Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Cruise is a heavy-hitter; every one of his movies usually makes good dough, and a lot are good. Foxx, up until now, has been reduced to your typical funny black guy roles in nearly every one of his movies. When you hear their names mentioned for the same movie, you don't think it's stupid or impossible, just that the product movie will be some sort of run of the mill, action/comedy buddy picture.When I first read the synopsis for 'Collateral' I thought I knew what it would be like: a PG-13 action comedy that is more concerned with A) getting stuff blowed up good and B) setting its characters up as very cool instead of very complex. It only makes senseI mean; Adam Sandler was in Foxx's role for a while before dropping out.Anyway, I was wrong, and glad about it.The plot follows Max (Jamie Foxx), a quiet, mild-mannered L.A. cab driver that knows all the best routes in town. This becomes clear early on in a tender scene where he picks up a lawyer (Jada Pinkett Smith) and they bet on whose routes will get them to her destination faster. On the way they talk and get to know each other, and we get to know Max. Sure, Smith's character has significance later on, but this scene would be just as important if she didn't.Max's next fare is Vincent (Tom Cruise), a grey-haired, hard looking real estate agent who, judging by his facial hair, looks like he spent his last two days on an airplane. He convinces and pays Max to drive him around to his five real estate deals that night. Max is reluctant, but Vincent is a fine-looking guy so he accepts.The next thing that happens is a surprise. If you have somehow managed to dodge all information on this film then don't read on.While parked in an alley waiting for Vincent on his first job, a body suddenly falls onto the top of Max's cab. Max is shocked, and when Vincent appears in the alleyway he cries for help. Vincent is cool and unaffected though, and he explains to Max that he is not, in fact, a real estate agent but a hit man, and Max is his getaway driver, whether he likes it or not.What follows is a complex character study and a simple thriller packed into one night, most of which takes place in a cab. Vincent and Max start off at odds, and though they do not become friends, they gain a deep understanding of each other as the night goes on. Vincent constantly tells Max his world view, that if we're all just specks on a dot in the universe, who cares if one person is murdered? Max ignores this and realizes that Vincent 'lacks the standard parts that others have'. Vincent also analyzes Maxhe tells him that he talks and does not do, that he's spent his life planning but taking no risks. They trade their analyses in a later scene that's supremely directed and acted.The film is mostly a cab ride/conversation between the two leads, which breaks occasionally to show us the cop on pursuit (Mark Ruffalo) and some of Vincent's hits, and Irma P. Hall as Max's mother in a scene that's funny and revealing. We also have Barry Shabaka Henley as a jazz club owner in a scene that's possibly the film's best, it's suspenseful, heartbreaking, and practically tears open Cruise, Foxx and Henley's characters.And what characters this movie has! Vincent is one of the screen's best villains; he's cool and menacing, but also very complex. He seems like a sociopath murderer, but he's more than that, and you can see the pain inside when he's mistaken as one. He's humanized when he is around people he likes, like Max and Henley's nightclub owner. He has elements of other famous villains, like Henry Fonda's Frank character from 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and Orson Welles' Harry Lime from 'The Third Man'. And just as Harry Lime has his famous cuckoo clock speech, Vincent has his own speech, about a man dieing on a subway train and not being noticed for hours. Cruise executes his character perfectly; it's both his finest character and his finest performance.But the film would die without both the Max character and Jamie Foxx. Max is just an average guy with his own dreams and goals and flaws, thrown into a desperate, dangerous situation forcing him to thwart a man he fears. He tries and tries for the whole night, tearful and shaky by the end, and he has an awesome scene where he turns the tables on Vincent and puts himself in control of their duo, causing Vincent to flip out.The movie is directed perfectly, with silences and cinematography that capture the emptiness of the night. Michael Mann manages to make the streets and skyscrapers of L.A. beautiful, both his direction and the grainy cinematography is worthy of an Oscar.This is one of the year's best films, and with hope it will be up for many Oscars, including Cruise and Foxx in the leading categories. Cruise and Foxx both mastered their roles, this is the best acting I've seen in years, it'll be a crime if the Academy doesn't honor them (especially after nominating 'Training Day', a movie with a very similar plot line that wasn't nearly as complex a character study).Another magnificent aspect is the ending. I wont spoil it, I'll just say that Vincent finds out the answer to the question, 'Who notices?' The symbolism of this scene is delicious, and it is emotional, dramatic, exciting and perfectly acted. A must-see, this is one of the best movies in a long while, 8.5/10.",8,57,86,19 August 2004
Aliens," It's awesome!
","'Aliens' stars Sigourney Weaver as Lt. Ellen Ripley, joining a group of hard-as-nails marines in a search for the aliens from the original on a stormy planet.  After spending a few hours, the aliens attack and the remaining marines, Ripley, android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and company man Burke (Paul Reiser) are left stranded on the planet with only a small amount of amo to protect themselves with.  There are countless classic action and suspense scenes, and throughout the entire film you are hanging on the edge of your seat.Of course, action isn't the only thing 'Aliens' has going for it.  The acting is A+ on all accounts.  Weaver delivers a performance ten times as passionate and ten times as dramatic than the first.  Henriksen is the perfect robot, by the way he moves you'd think that he had gears instead of elbows.  Reiser is sinister, but I have to say that Ian Holm played a better 'company man' in the first.'Aliens' not only creates some of the most suspenseful scenes in cinematic history, but also one of the greatest sci-fi films out there, 8.5/10.",Null,0,0,28 July 2003
The Usual Suspects," No matter how many times you watch this masterpiece, it never ceases to amaze you
","'The Usual Suspects' is the greatest crime thriller ever made, no contest whatsoever.  The plot focuses on a cop (Chazz Palminteri), who interrogates the only survivor of a massacre on a boat, gimp Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey).  Kint tells him of a police line-up that happened two weeks earlier, and the story starts.Members of the line-up are crime veteren Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), slightly psychotic McManus (Stephen Baldwin), clever Hockney (Kevin Pollak) and smoothie Fenster (Benicio Del Toro).  Each actor plays their part so well that you don't even recognize them.  Byrne looks more lazy than usual. Baldwin looks thin, and you forget that he's even a Baldwin brother.Of course, none of these performances match Spacey's.  He walks, talks and acts nothing like any of his previous characters.  Spacey isn't just a fifteen minute star, he's a classic actor.And this is a classic movie, 9/10.",Null,0,1,18 July 2003
Batman Begins," The best...
","The first super-hero movie was released twenty-seven years ago, and it's taken twenty-six years to get the formula exactly right. That was last year, with 'Spider-Man 2', which was a lot of fun. And now we have Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins', and the formula is perfected. I guess it took a more serious character like Batman to do so, and it does so.Christian Bale plays the Dark Knight, and his counterpart Bruce Wayne. This is a Bruce unlike that of Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer or George Clooney; a Bruce Wayne far less glamorousa man who is most of the time consumed with only one thought: justice. This is the Bruce Wayne of the comics, and finally. The other Batman films focused more on the villains than Bruce or Batman, this one has more villains than any of those movies, and yet it manages to be foremost a character study of our hero.The film begins where the first thoughts of Batman started circulating in Bruce's mind: when he accidentally falls into a large cave and is attacked by a swarm of frightening bats.He then develops a phobia of them, and when he is reminded of this fear at an opera with his parents, he asks to leave. His father Thomas (Linus Roache), a kind, earnest man, with his wife, takes his son out into the alley to comfort him. Here they are assaulted by a thief, and in a moment both Bruce's parents have been murdered.This event, along with the bat attack, changes Bruce forever. He loses interest in his multi-billion dollar company, and in the family heritage that his keeper Alfred (Michael Caine) tries so hard to polish. When he has reached his twenties, Bruce disappears to a small Asian country to learn about the nature of evil.It is in a prison there that he is picked up by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), who takes Bruce to a mountainside temple to train in the ways of the ninja with him and the mysterious Rha's Al Ghul (Ken Watanabe). The two run the League of Shadows, an organization that has worked for centuries to bring justice to the Earth.When Bruce has completed his training he returns to Gotham City, which was in even worse shape than when he left. It seems that Assistant DA Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) and police sergeant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) are the only ones willing to fight against the powerful underworld, headed by crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson with a surprising accent) and the corrupt Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy).It is at this point that Batman begins. How he changes his mind his body and his assets into those of the Dark Knight is a delight that I will let you behold on your own. The movie is strangely philosophical, delving deep into the nature of fear and evil that reminds me of Lord of the Flies. A bizarre comparison, I know, but isn't it refreshing when a comic book movie is smart, and not afraid to ask questions about morality? I'd prefer that to any boyish 'Daredevil' or 'Hulk' any day.As with all super-hero movies there are enemies, and those enemies have a menacing plot, but who those enemies are and what that plot is are all pieces in the puzzle that is this movie's thrilling plot, so I will not spoil it for you. But I will say that it is few things: exciting, intelligent, dark, humorous, deep, and lots of fun.What's astonishing is how the movie is full of incredibly talented (and famed) actors  Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer and Ken Watanabe  and yet it is entirely about Bruce Wayne, and still we have enough allotted time for the other actors to make an impression. It's a feat in balance, Nolan and writer David S. Goyer should be proud. There is also not a bad performance in the movie  well, Katie Holmes could've brushed up a little, but she doesn't take away from the films greatness. There are some surprises; too, with Linus Roache for example, great as a man with a heart of gold, and Cillian Murphy, who is very creepy  especially for a psychiatrist.One performance in particular I feel I should mention is Liam Neeson's, who is always a joy to watch, and shines here in a role not too unlike ones he's played before. But his Henri Ducard is unlike his Qui-Gon Jinn, Priest Vallon or Godfrey of Ibalin in that he is more fascistic, and like all movie fascists, he finds philosophies that he uses to justify himself, that are credible, and make us think. It is an impressive performance; I could see him getting some recognition for it.Same goes for Christian Bale, who is more human than any of the super-hero protagonists before him  except Tobey Maguire, I guess. But hey, Bale is cooler too. And we never once see him as an actor trying to emulate that comic book gusto. He is Bruce Waynethe Bruce Wayne we've been waiting for, the one done right. His Batman is a convincing menace, too.I mentioned that the movie is dark. Yes, quite. Not particularly violent, like 'Batman Returns', but creepy and even frightening at times. Gotham is almost a character in itself, filmed perfectly, with all the layers of grime and corruption. The action that takes place there is quick and loud, unlike the highly choreographed bouts we see in 'Daredevil' or 'X-Men', the action scenes are instead a fury of fists and fog, and they are brilliant, in particular a chase scene with the Batmobile and the police.This is one of the movies of the year, which might be denied because it's a comic book, but those who get rid of their inhibitions will be pleasantly surprised.9/10",9,1,2,22 June 2005
The Princess Bride," One of the best fantasy films ever made
","'The Princess Bride' is different from your usual fantasy film.  It's not as cute as Star Wars or as meaningful as Lord of the Rings.  It's just made to entertain you.  From the fast, snappy screen-play to the great performance from Mandy Patinkin, this defines good fantasy.The story focuses on two departed loved ones: Westley (Cary Ewles), a farmer boy supposedly killed by pirates and Buttercup (Robin Wright Penn) a dim witted girl now being forced to marry Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon). Westley returns to take his love back from the evil Prince, and he must face great odds and villains like Count Rugen (Christopher Guest) to do so.Helping him is giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant) and vengeful Spainard Indigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin).  Patinkin plays Montoya passionately and comedicly, making him the most interesting character in the movie.All in all, The Princess Bride never lets you down.  Great movie, 9/10.",10,0,1,1 July 2003
Seabiscuit," Good? Yeah...sure. Best Picture? Far from it!
","'Seabiscuit' is a movie about horse racing.  Yeah, yeah, it's about 'a long shot becoming a legend' and 'the future' and other corny stuff like that, but when it all comes down to it, 'Seabiscuit' is about horse racing.  It's about small people who ride horses around in a circle.  That's the main plot of the movie.  It's all about manager Harris (Jeff Bridges), trainer Smith (Chris Cooper) and jockey Red (Tobey Maguire) trying to improve their horse for the next horse race.And it's nominated for Best Picture of the Year in the 2004 Oscars.  That is really the biggest problem I have with this movie.  Sure, it's good, the actors and a good script redeem it's cheesy premise, but you really have to ask yourself what the hell the Academy was thinking when they nominated this movie over 'Big Fish' or 'The Last Samurai' or 'In America', or many other great films released in 2003 that exceeded this hundred and forty-one minute horse race.Maybe I'm coming down too harsh, after all, the actors did well.  There is a certain amount of star power in this film, which saves it from the fact that the majority of the characters are about as interesting as fingernail dirt. Bridges' role isn't anything special, but it is Bridges, so him being on the screen made me happy.  Chris Cooper knocked me out of my seat in 'American Beauty' and 'Adaptation', and did nearly as well in this movie.  Of course, the protagonist is played by Tobey Maguire - the worst actor ever - so it loses major points for that.Overall this is an average film saved by it's performances and script, but if it wins tomorrow I'll be a very unhappy man, 7/10.",Null,0,0,28 February 2004
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Doesn't live up to the original, though still very entertaining - and hey, Pete Postlethwaite is in it!
","'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' is the sequel to 'Jurassic Park', and is about Ian Malcolm's (Jeff Goldblum) journey to Isla Nublar - or 'Site B' - a tropical island where the hungry dinos run free.  Helping Malcolm are his girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore), photographer Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn), technician Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) and Malcolm's daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester).The actors - most notably Moore and Schiff - play their parts pretty well. Goldblum doesn't capture the same hilarious, eccentric shtick that helped him in the first one, but he still manages to be comical now and then. Chester and Vaughn are probably the worst performances in the movie, but I didn't expect much from them anyay.My favorite part of 'The Lost World' would be Pete Postlethwaite's role as Roland Tempo, a domineering hunter who is leading the opposing group of researchers into the island.  The role is basically a regurgitation of Bob Peck's from the original (British guy with soft voice and rifle),  but is still very fun.The action sequences are well done of course - being Speilberg - but from such a wonderful book one would expect more.  Still, from when the raptors are pulling hunters one-by-one under the tall grass (in a very memorable scene) to when the T - Rex is tearing appart Malcolm's trailer, the action scenes will keep you at the edge of your seat.'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' isn't exactly a worthy sequel, but still a fun one, 7.5/10.",Null,0,0,25 July 2003
Hellboy," Good, stylish and different, one of the better 'super-hero' movies...
","'Hellboy' is based on the underground comic book about a demon called from Hell by Nazis in the 40s, but then 'rescued' by American soldiers and raised to become an investigator of paranormal activity, and, well, a super-hero. It is now the present day, and Hellboy (Ron Perlman) and his 'father' (John Hurt), the scientist who rescued him, are joined by a colorful group of avengers in their crime fighting activities.  The list includes pyrokinetic Liz (Selma Blair), fish-man Abe Sapien (voiced by David Hyde Pierce), and FBI agent Myers (Rupert Evans).When the Nazis who took Hellboy from Hell - led by Rasputin (Karel Roden) - resurface...well, all Hell breaks loose (no pun intended).  Characters you like die, questions arise, and there are lots and lots of fight scenes.Overall this is a good movie.  The characters are cool and fun to watch, the style is great, there are some awesomely cool lines and its just on a different level from other comic book movies.  Ron Perlman is great as the red hero, very cool and collected, speaking dry, witty lines while fighting devilish monsters.  The other actors all put forth, John Hurt and Selma Blair playing the most interesting characters, and Jeffrey Tambor giving a funny touch to his no-nonsense director of the Bureau.Nonetheless, `Hellboy' is not a perfect film.  The action is at times hard to watch, the climax and last five minutes are  I have to say  pathetic, and many questions are left unanswered.  I guess if I read the comics I would have a better understanding, of it, but the best super-hero movies make sense to readers of the comics and to new fans.  Some stuff in this movie just didn't make any sense.  For instance, the Nazi woman is young and blonde in the forties at the beginning of the film, and still young and blonde sixty years later when the rest takes place.  Same with Kroenen (Ladislav Beran), a villain who's been shot, stabbed, castrated, and had is eyelids and bottom and upper lip torn off, his blood is dust, and he still manages to live.  How this happens is not explained.But, you really don't care; it's obviously not a movie to be taken seriously.  In the end it's nothing more than a fun, exciting super-hero flick, 7.5/10.",8,0,0,10 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," This entire three hour movie can be summed up in one word: AMAZING
","And, by amazing I don't mean 'mostly good'.  By amazing I don't mean 'could've been better'.  By amazing I mean the template for perfection. Peter Jackson's second act of the trilogy, 'The Two Towers' is not only three hours of eye candy, but three hour of ear candy, heart candy and any other kind of candy.  As everyone knows, the second act is always the hardest, but Peter Jackson seemed to make this great film with ease.The story, continuing from 'Fellowship', focuses on two plotlines: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis), who leads them to Mordor and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) helping the Rohirrihm.  The writers did very well blending these two stories together, just like Tolkien did.The star of this movie is without a doubt Gollum.  Even though he is a complete CGI character, he turns out to be the opposite of Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't comic relief, he isn't there for cute laughs, he is the same, tormented character as he was in the book.Of course, the action in this movie ranks up with 'Braveheart' for great Medieval warfare.  As most know, the last forty-five minutes of this movie is one long war scene.  Despite being so long, it never becomes boring or cheesy, and you're never getting restless in your seat.  In fact, you're on the edge of it the whole twenty-seven thousand seconds of it.This film still has faults though, as all do, but they are miniscule compared to the great brilliance.  There are but two things in 'Towers' that bugged me: the slightly overdone love story between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Gimli's (John Rhys-Davies) delve into comedy.  I'm not saying that Gimli wasn't funny, I'm saying that he wasn't as dramatic as he should have been.As I said, the faults are tiny compared to the brilliance.  'The Two Towers' never even comes close to disappointing, 9/10.",10,0,0,17 July 2003
The Incredibles," A ball of pure bravado, indeed, everyone will enjoy this movie
","For almost a decade Pixar has been making good movies; and 'The Incredibles' is the best one yet.There are a lot of reasons why 'The Incredibles' is better than both Toy Story movies, 'A Bug's Life', 'Monsters Inc.' and 'Finding Nemo', but I think the most important one is that it takes itself seriously. It doesn't contain a single seeable in-joke, no reference that makes us remember it's just a silly movie. It's about the characters, their lives and their world, and it makes us believe one hundred percent in them.The movie is about superheroes (or 'supers') Mr. Incredible, a dashing Superman type with fierce strength, and Elastigirl, a kind-hearted woman who can stretch her body to unbelievable lengths. They live in a kind of 50s New York where there are car chases and old lady's cats stuck in trees, problems which they solve with diligence and justice. But lately things have been looking down for the supers  property damage, obsessive fansand one night after saving a man from killing himself Mr. Incredible is sued because the man 'didn't want to be saved'.And so the superhero relocation program is opened, which eliminates the superheroes and places the secret identities hidden around America, to lead normal lives. Mr. Incredible, now called Bob Parr, begins a regular existence with his wife Helen, who is, of course, Elastigirl. Living in the same neighborhood is Lucius, who used to be Frozone, an agile superhero who has the ability to turn the moisture in the air into ice and snow. Bob and Helen have kids, of course, lightning-fast Dash, disappearing Violet and Jack Jackwho is normal.Then the movie takes a surprising turn: instead of just supplying us with one scene with the bored family and then rushing into the action, it shows us Bob's boredom with his life, Helen's determination to raise her family to be normal, and the kids coping to ordinary school life as secret superheroes. These middle scenes are the movies' funniest, and they are kind of touching, in away. This is Pixar's first movie solely about humans, and, surprisingly enough, the characters are actuallyhuman.Of course, being an action movie, the film needs action (or else it could've just been a live action film). The plot supplies us with plenty of it. Bob and Lucius spend their 'bowling night' listening to police scanners so they can race around the city, saving people. They are being tracked by an agent from a mysterious company named Mirage, who discovers their alter egos and takes Bob to a remote tropical island. On that island she tells him that a secret government weapon robot has been set loose on the island, and he must find it and capture it. The first battle between the two is spectacular, and it really feels glorious for Bob.So he goes home and, full of new enthusiasm, he starts working out and taking part in more missions, and even getting a new costume from designer Edna 'E' Mode. Helen is buzzed by his new grasp on his life, but the happiness doesn't last for so longbut I will say no more. The plot has a certain surprise to it, so I'll let you see for yourself. I'll just say it involves the entire family on the island, using their powers in one wondrous scene after another.The animation is fabulous, probably the best I've seen. The voice actors  Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Jason Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, and others  all bring even more life to their characters (and Hunter's voice fits her part perfectly, I'll say). The writing is very funny and creates a very exciting feeling that never leaves, and the whole style of the movie, the 50s, Bond, superhero elements, just add to the bravado.It's also smart, smarter than your typical kids' movie, as in a scene where Frozone can't use his ice powers in a burning building because all of the moisture is evaporated. And the insights into the characters lives are in a way touching. It never gets too complicated though, we don't have an explanation for everything (including how the characters got their powers) and it doesn't matter. It is a simple, smart movie.My only small qualm is that it's a bit too longjust a few minutes, nothing big. If a minute was shaved here or there I think the movie may have improved a little, but it hardly matters.The movie is excellent, when kids a few decades from now look back on the Pixar films, I hope that they'll remember 'The Incredibles'.8/10.",Null,0,0,20 November 2004
Kick-Ass," I hated this movie
","I can see how 'Kick-Ass' is gonna be popular...but, then, I can see how 'Transformers 2' could be popular, too. Now that that's out of the way...If you're someone who thinks it might be a lark to watch an 11-year-old corner a defenceless woman and stab her twice through the chest, this movie might be for you. There's also a scene where she puts a guy in a trash compactor and we watch for a couple minutes as he's squished to death. The guy wasn't a character before this scene (and I don't remember what relevance he has to the movie), so we're not watching the payoff to a joke, we're just watching...a guy getting squished by a trash compactor. The brutality of the scene is immediately undercut with the 11-year-old employing some nasty profanity, an easy joke that'll get an immediate reaction, doing away with the conflict I imagine (hope?) a lot of the audience will be feeling after the scene that preceded it.The premise is: real people trying to be super-heroes (not a bad idea - I liked it in 'The Dark Knight'). Dave is a comic book geek modelled, I assume, on most of the movie's target audience. He actually bears a closer resemblance to a Michael Cera hero, but, I'll get to that later. Anyway, he likes comic books, he decides to start 'fighting crime' (which is always just around the corner in these movies) so he orders a suit and goes at it. He's not very good, and his friends make fun of him for the idea.Meanwhile, an ex-cop (Nicolas Cage - very good) is turning his young daughter (the 11-year-old) into a cold-blooded killer, for our benefit. They're playing out a revenge scheme against the movie's chief villain, a mob boss played by Mark Strong. The plot in this movie sometimes feels like math: setup + action = payoff. Actually, that's exactly what it feels like. It's supposed satire is constantly undercut by its rigid obedience to its own formula. Since we can already guess, roughly, how everything will play out, I don't know why 'Kick-Ass' spends so much time explaining itself.When you hear the premise - real people trying to be superheroes - it sounds good, but watching this movie makes you think there are really only a few ways to handle it. There's 'The Dark Knight' or 'Iron Man' way, which is, more or less, taking it seriously. Or you could go for a satirical/darkly comic tone, which this movie tries for. If you were to do that, the best way to handle the violence would be to make it convincing, wouldn't it? Since, as the movie opens, it seems to make itself very clear that it doesn't take place in some phony superhero world? Instead, people get shot, they fall dead and CGI blood squirts out. You've seen one guy squirt CGI blood, you've seen 'em all - and it happens over and over again. The violence in this movie packs no punch, it's thoughtless and, supposedly, fun!, which makes it all the more disheartening when it's directed at the defenceless woman.So it wasn't a very pleasant experience for me. Shift it an inch one way and you could've had a nice dark comedy (something by the Coens). An inch the other way you could've had a clever action movie (Crank & Crank 2). 'Kick-Ass' is like a cautious kid, skirting the deep end without having the nerve to stick his toes in the water. It's not ballsy enough to take the father/daughter relationship to the logical, risky conclusion that it demands. It's not smart enough to question the motives of its boring protagonist - he's, basically, good (and he gets the girl). It's not original enough to offer us any 'evil' that's not the cartoon kind we've already been tired of seeing in thousands of others movies. It's sense of humour is on the level of a disturbed child who likes to use swear words - which is one of its favourite jokes.I said the movie's about real people trying to be superheroes. Not quite. It's about the 'real people' you see in Hollywood movies, becoming superheroes. The 'real people' played by Michael Cera or Shia LaBoef or Miley Cyrus. The ones who live in a glossy, safe world where they get what they want in the end. In this case, it's to have sex and kill a bunch of people. That could make for a great joke, except that, like those glossy Hollywood movies, it doesn't have the confidence to get you to actually think about it.4/10 (Three points Nicolas Cage, one point Clark Duke.

Million Dollar Baby," A movie that will last
","'Million Dollar Baby' has great characters, but it doesn't glorify them. It has a wonderful story, but it never tries to impress you. The photography, score and direction is superb, but never distracting. What this movie is, if I have to call it something, is passion. Passion for film-making, passion for storytelling, passion for its characters, passion for its actors, and passion for its story and the means at which it will go to tell it. Amazing.Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns a messy boxing gym which is populated, mostly, by downbeat losers who he spends some time training. He runs it with his friend and former student Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who now lives contently at a room in the gym. One day a young woman named Maggie (Hilary Swank) walks in, looking for a manager and trainer. Frankie shafts her immediately ('girly, tough ain't enough'). Frankie has bigger things on his hands. He's managing a fighter who has a shot at a title bout.But Frankie is old and weathered and not an appealing manager, so the fighter leaves him. Frankie is broken by this; it is another in a long line of rejections and separations. We can tell that, at this time in his life, he only gets really close with those he's training (Scrap is the only exception). We can tell that his loneliness  and a bit of persuasion from Scrap  cause him to agree to teach Maggie. Teach, that is the agreement, not manage. But, by the end of the film he will have devoted his life to her.So the rest of the story follows these two people. There is no real 'plot' that you could describe in a trailer because it is constantly changingit is not the inspiring underdog story you may think of it as. No, what it's 'about' is these characters, and how they react to the circumstances around them, which change with each scene.Narrating the story is Scrap, speaking like he's looking back to a time long ago when everything has passed. His voice seems flat, deadpan, but there is a working of subtle sorrow in it. Scrap is a sad human being, he sees himself as the result of missed opportunities in the past, and so he spends his time helping the others, offering them his wise advice, with a tone of deadpan humor and even cockiness. Scrap knows what should be done, and what will happen regardless, and he is sort of okay with everything, in a sort of passive way. But the man also knows what's right and he has a deep, inner strength which is displayed in one scene in particular where you just have to cheer. It is an intriguing character, and personally I think it's Freeman's best performance.And Eastwood's best too. He is an elderly man; some might say too elderly to still be working. After all, most people are retired by his age. But if you had to guess when you're watching this film, you would never, ever say the man is seventy-four. You would say something closer to the sixties, because the man has such amazing energy and dedication, and above all, he has talent. It's been forty long years since 'A Fist Full of Dollars' and film has come a long way, and so has this man. At seventy-four, passed all those years as an action hero, nearing what's could be the end of his career, Eastwood has made his best movie. I really, really hope he has time to make many more.As for Swank, well, she must have found something big that she shared with her character, because this is not acting, it is existing. Swank is Maggie. That's all there is too it. This could be the movie she will be remembered for.So, 'Million Dollar Baby' is a masterpiece. I saw it last night when it opened in my city, and everyone else was seeing 'White Noise', and I was shaking my head. Everyone who is even remotely interested in movies should see this one, just so they can know how movies are supposed to be made. I'm trying to think, and there is not a single thing here where Eastwood went wrong. The acting, directing, writing, score, cinematographythey all accomplish precisely what they're supposed to with sublime perfection. Many of these aspects will certainly receive Oscars and all of them should.You may cry through this film, you may cheer. Whatever the case, you will love it.9/10.",Null,580,721,8 January 2005
Shrek 2," A sweet, enjoyable start to the summer...
","...'Shrek 2' starts where 'Shrek' left off, with Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) arriving home from their honeymoon, meeting back up with Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and soon being invited to Fiona's parent's castle in the kingdom of 'Far Far Away'.  King Harold (John Cleese) and the Queen (Julie Andrews) don't know that they're both ogres, of course.The first 'Shrek' was a very fun, very new and original film, and I didn't expect 'Shrek 2' to duplicate that - and it didn't.  While the original Shrek was funny for poking fun at fairy tale cliches, this one derives most of it's humor from pop culture references.  This sometimes doesn't work, but most of the time it does.It does have two master strokes, though.  The new character of Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is wonderfully written, animated and voiced, and the film's villain - Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) is hilarious and cool. The writers' ability to come up with great characters is still there (but we don't have John Lithgow this time around, which is an inevitable loss).The voice acting is great too, the only 'bad' voice performance comes from Cameron Diaz (of course).  All the other actors do wonderfully in their parts, especially Murphy, Banderas and Cleese.  The animation of the characters and settings is lush and full of life too, the movie is beautiful to look at.But it is what it is: a light, clever sequel to a groundbreaking film.  It's good for a ride, but I still prefer the first 'Shrek', 7.5/10.",Null,0,0,11 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Wonderful, epic martial arts film...
","...Every director has an epic.  For David Lean it was `Lawrence of Arabia'. For Steven Speilberg it was the `Indiana Jones' trilogy.  For Peter Jackson it was `The Lord of the Rings'.  `Kill Bill' is Tarantino's epic.The story of The Bride (Uma Thurman), a former assassin gunned down by her old comrades at her wedding rehearsal, and how she awakes from a coma four years later, hungry for vengeance.  Her first targets are O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), the first now a Japanese crime boss and the second an American housewife.  The Bride locates her prey, meets them, declares `unfinished business' and engages in a battle.Of course, it's not easy.  Vernita is a master with a knife and O-Ren has a massive amount of bodyguards.  What I like about this is that the story isn't told in chronological order.  It's unusual in a movie that the first target (O-Ren) in the movie is more of a challenge than the second (Vernita) but realistic (the first target is not always easier), but Tarantino decides to tell the battle with Vernita before the battle with O-Ren.Tarantino's script is also written well.  It's not as impressive or quotable as `Pulp Fiction' or `Reservoir Dogs', but it's better than ninety-nine percent of your usual Hollywood writer.  His direction is the feat here though.  He's always talked about how much he loves action movies, but he's never directed one up until now.  Here he proves he can direct an action movie better than your usual Michael Bay or George Lucas.  The camerawork is perfect and the camera tricks are clever.  Going in and out of black and white, just showing the silhouettes of the characters fighting, playing spaghetti western type music during the fight scenes, all pieces of the puzzle of some great action sequences.If Tarantino were Edward D. Wood Jr. then Sonny Chiba would be his Bela Lugosi.  It's lovely seeing Tarantino work with his idols (Pam Grier, David Carradine) and Chiba certainly works here.  Chiba plays a sword maker who The Bride goes to for help; he is positively charming, funny and cool in his scenes and you can just picture Tarantino behind the camera shouting `Excellent!'Of course, it's still only half the story.  No major plot points occur, the characters aren't really developed, and there are no plot twists until the very end.  If you're looking for all that, then chances are you'll like Volume 2 more, but if you're the kind of person for great action with some dramatic elements, you'll love Volume 1, 8/10.",10,0,1,16 April 2004
Jerry Maguire," Overrated, but still a good drama
","I find 'Jerry Maguire' incredibly overrated, and it shouldn't have been nominated for such awards as 'Best Picture' and 'Best Actor'.  It's a good drama, but it's certainly nothing different from the usual Tom Cruise flick.Although, if there is anything in this movie that deserved it's award, it'd definitely be Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance.  He plays the loud, obnoxious, but still lovable football player Rod Tidwell.  Gooding Jr.'s acting is one hundred percent, and he deserved his Oscar win.Aside from the supporting actor, this is an overrated, sappy, 'feel good' movie.  7/10.",Null,0,4,1 July 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A Burton film
","Tim Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is, like all of Burton's films, so visually delightful that the plot almost doesn't matter. This can make and break a film; sometimes Burton can undermine the importance of his story with the quirkiness of how it looks, like with 'Edward Scissorhands'. But his best films ('Sleepy Hollow' and 'Big Fish') marry the visuals and the plot, so that the two work together to create an even flow for the movie.I'd say 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' almost succeeds at that, but there are times when it feels like we're looking at post cards from the infamous factory. The film, like the original 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory', is about a poor boy (Freddie Highmore) who wins a contest and travels with four other kids into the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory, run by the even-more-mysterious Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). From there on in, it's an adventure through the many bizarre - and sometimes surreal - departments of the factory.In the original, Willy Wonka was played by Gene Wilder in a mostly straight performance that channeled the witty, cane-twirling comedians of the thirties. Here Depp does carry a cane, but he does no twirling, and the performance is far from straight. His Willy Wonka is a mix of Michael Jackson and a Barbie doll, and grows more unnecessarily confusing as the movie goes on. It's not exactly a bad performance, but it does feel like Depp's parading his versatility. I think he should have toned it down a little, and gone for the innocence of his Sam character from 'Benny & Joon'.The movie is not a misfire, as it has many good aspects. Freddie Highmore is excellent as Charlie, he is believably earnest. In fact, all of the child actors are pretty good. Most of the adult ones seem a little understated, impressive that they let the children take the foreground. David Kelly shines as Charlie's Grandpa Joe, giving probably the best and funniest performance in the movie - why hasn't this guy been a star for the past few decades? The Oompa Loompas are all played by Deep Roy, who manages to be creepier than those in the seventies version, who were orange with green hair. When you think about it, Roy's performance is tremendously complicated, as he had to move in synchronization with himself thousands of times.Occasionally the movie gets lost in itself, raising questions that are never answered. Near the beginning Grandpa Joe tells an anecdote about Wonka's building a chocolate castle for an Indian prince. I was interested in seeing how this fitted into the story later on, but that's just it: it didn't. It seems to be just a comment on the film's own special effects. What Burton needs to learn is that it's mostly dangerous to remind his viewer's that they're watching a movie.The plot is also a little too similar to the first's, it never really throws any new curves at us, we know exactly what to expect (though, curiously, the magical floating bubbles scene from the original is missing).In short, it relies a little too much on Depp's performance and the set design - it seems Charlie and Grandpa Joe are almost forgotten when they enter the factory. But it's not boring, if predictable, and it's interesting to look at, and Depp's performance is intriguing, if not fitting.Come on, it's a Burton film.7.5/10",7,0,1,29 August 2005
Big Fish," A beautiful ensemble of acting, writing and direction...
","...'Big Fish' is cult director Tim Burton's latest film.  Unlike most of his other work (except for maybe 'Edward Scissorhands') this film has a more happy and fun tone to it.  The plot focuses on two stories: in the first (and frame story) William Bloom (Billy Crudup) visits his mother Sandra (Jessica Lange) and estranged father Ed (Albert Finney).  Will hasn't seen his dad in years, so he wants to get to know him before the man passes away. Ed agrees, but his stories don't always seem as true or realistic as possible.In his stories he is portrayed by Ewan McGregor, and we watch him travel the world and meet many interesting people.  He meets a lonely giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory), works for a greedy circus ringmaster (Danny DeVito) and runs into a beautiful town called Spectre with inhabitants like would-be-poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi in a delightful role).  As he hears these stories over and over again, Will begins to get suspicious that his father has a double life.  I wont spoil anything else for you!The acting, writing and direction is all wonderful.  The best performance of the movie (by far) comes from Albert Finney's Old Ed Bloom.  The man is jolly and sad, dying and yet he has a childish giddiness to him.  The role was perfect for Finney, and he was perfect for the role.  McGregor also does quite well (especially with his accent), and, of course, the supporting cast shines - most notably Lange in a tender, beautiful role.The scriptwriting is creative and clever, a definite nom for Best Adapted Screenplay (and hopefully a win).  Tim Burton gives us a new view of himself, not only is he a brilliant horror director but he can also make a touching drama.So if you're itching to see the Oscar contenders of 2003, see 'Big Fish' first, 8.5/10.",Null,0,0,18 January 2004
The Dark Knight," This one's gonna be around a long time
","On my list of favourite movies I try to strike a balance between art and entertainment. Both forms are equally important to film and its existence today. That said, I would also put forth that the criteria for a great movie is a balance within itself between the two. A lot of movies try this, but few get it right. The films of Akira Kurosawa or Billy Wilder are good examples of ones that succeed, and I think The Dark Knight is too.Let me start with entertainment. Well, this movie is always engaging, scene for scene, and you never feel like you're waiting for it to hurry along. It's two and a half hours, but it feels shorter than 'Iron Man' or 'Indiana Jones' (both still pretty good). Nolan's direction as well as Wally Pfister's cinematography (you've heard about the IMAX scenes) lend a sense of grandeur to the action scenes that make you feel like something is actually happening, right in front of you  and better, that it matters. The movie is very sad, but also very, very fun. It's to his credit that Nolan understands Batman can be a dark, complex loner and still spout cool lines before he punches people.The story is epic, tragic, and speaks to your soul in a way that creates an emotional reaction in you. Can you say that about The Incredible Hulk? Can you say that about most movies? People might complain that Batman seems like a supporting character in his own story, but I think that's a flawed analysis. Batman, like The Joker, is complete  unchanging. We're never in doubt, even if he is, about Bruce Wayne's selflessness or the morality of his decisions. Even at one point when he has to make a pretty tough choice between two people, one couldn't possibly blame him for his answer. For this reason Batman works best as a sort of unstoppable force of nature, swooping down on his enemies and humiliating them for thinking they can enact the anarchy they represent  until The Joker swoops in and humiliates Batman for thinking the opposite.I could talk about The Joker, but everyone knows already  and if you don't, go see the movie. What I wanna talk about is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent. In a way, he and Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon are putting themselves at greater risk than Batman, because they don't have the mask to hide behind. They're placing themselves and their loved ones in between the enemies' cross hairs, just because they really, truly believe in the justice they're defending. But one of the questions the movie seems to be asking is is it worth it? The film is ambiguous in its answer. Obviously it's clear who the good guys and bad guys are, but the battle to illuminate one instinct and suppress the other has such a psychological toll on one character that he starts to see justice and anarchy as two arbitrary sides of the same coin. If there is none of the order he's trying to uphold in his own life, then how can he be sure it exists at all? So he insanely lashes out at both sides in the only way that makes sense to him.Who wins, in the fight between justice and anarchy? Well by the end of the movie there seem to be no signs of the battle coming to a close any time soon. The movie only provides us with a slight glimmer of hope during the climax, which I won't ruin. But, in The Joker's words, maybe we're destined to be doing this for a very long time.",10,1,3,21 July 2008
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An explosion of visual flare, with a touching story at its heart
","'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is a movie you have to see. Well, okay, lot's of people won't like it, but that always happens. If you have a mind for creative, unconventional film, you'll like it. Maybe even love it. If it weren't for the magnificent 'Napoleon Dynamite' this would be the most creative, unconventional film of the year. Okay. So it's the second most.Of course, Charlie Kaufman wrote it, so we should expect that, I guess. Kaufman's first widely liked film was 'Being John Malkovich', in which John Cusack and others venture into John Malkovich's mind and wreak all sorts of havoc. His second (and best) was 'Adaptation', which was supposed to be based on a Susan Orlean book but then became a quirky drama about Charlie Kaufman  yes, the same Charlie Kaufman  and his deep personal problems. After these two films, people would just sit there, long after the movie ended, thinking 'Huh?'. But the films were just so intriguing and different that those same people loved them, too.And now comes another abstract, quirky creative film. This time it's directed by Michael Gondry, not Spike Jonze, proving that directors other than Jonze can successfully work with Kaufman's material. The film starts with Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) waking up in bed, then spontaneously ditching work to take a walk on a beach. He sees a woman far away. He sees her again, in a restaurant, then at the train station, then in the train. Then she talks to him, introducing herself as Clementine (Kate Winslet).They like each other, they hit it off and spend a whole day together. Then a few things happen, and we see that their relationship has ended badly and Clementine has impulsively went to a rag-tag business called 'Lacuna Inc.' to have her memory of Joel erased. Joel is shattered when he finds out, and so he Joel goes to the business to check it out.The technology is impressive, but it is a strange little office, run by the soft-spoken Dr. Howard (Tom Wilkinson) and with a team that practically worships him, made up of Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Patrick (Elijah Wood) and secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst).Joel asks for the procedure to be done, and so Stan and Patrick are sent to his apartment at night after Joel's been drugged to go to work on him. They attach a large metal dome to his head as he lies in bed, set up a computer and start. These scenes are pretty funny, because it's surprising how the team using this fantastic new technology is so detached and incompetent. Stan and Patrick drink and talk about women and whatnot, and then Mary comes over and they get high and do...well, nothing suitable for a successful workplace.The bulk of the movie takes place in Joel's mind, where his subconscious (in the form of Jim Carrey) tries to fight the process and hold onto as many great memories of Clementine as he can. We get many episodes showing great (and not-so-great) moments in the past of their relationship, where Joel is simultaneously either enacting in them, watching them, or trying to break free to save his wonderful memories. Confusing, I know.So Joel and Clementine (the Clementine made up of the memories in Joel's mind, not the real Clementine) come up with a plan to hide in memories in which Clementine was not present, and we get many scenes of Joel as a child, or in a miniature child's body, or...well, it's bizarre, but bizarrely effective.Back in the real world Dr. Howard is called over to solve the problem, and we see the real Clementine breaking down, and also being romanced by Patrick...lots of other stuff happens, but that's all I can explain. See the movie and you'll get it.The film has been widely praised because of its fantastic portrayal of dream states (which I don't think are as good as those in 'Waking Life' but hey, that's just me) but the film is primarily about its characters. Sure, the dream states are great, I loved how things are crumbling or disappearing around Joel as his memories are being erased, but it's more stupendous because of its characters, which all are fully realized and perfectly acted.I have a few qualms with the film, my first and most important one being that there are many romantic scenes with Joel and the Clem of his mind, but they aren't effective or sincere because this is not the real Clem, and nothing is or can possibly be accomplished when Joel asks her 'Can't we give it another go?'. The scenes with the real Clem and the real Joel are definitely the most touching. Also, sometimes the dream scenes feel repetitive, and there are a few moments where there are so many things happening at once that the focus is momentarily gone and the movie is just too frantic.It has a heart at its center though, a wonderfully imaginative screenplay and fantastic performances from Jim Carrey (at his best here), Winslet, Wilkinson, Dunst, Ruffalo and Wood. The flaws are forgotten soon after you watch the film, and the strange albeit touching story stays with you. It's good.8/10.",8,1,3,12 January 2005
The Mummy Returns," Better than the first, truly great adventure.
","Of course, almost every summer blockbuster has a sequel these days, and most of the time the disappoint, with little to no character development.  The Mummy Returns doesn't follow that pattern.  The characters are built on, the story thickens, and the action gets even better!The two characters that are built on from the first are Evy (Rachel Weisz) and Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr).  In the first, Evy was more of a 'Damsel in Distress' whereas in the second she's more independent.  Ardeth just showed up in the first, but in the second we learn more about his people and get to know the character more.And, of course, there is the action.

Avatar," Looks great, I just wish I cared what happened in it
","'Avatar' is not the next 'Star Wars' or 'Lord of the Rings.' It might be the next 'Matrix,' though. Or, perhaps more accurate, the next 'Matrix Revolutions.' It's technically groundbreaking craftmanship put to work on a story that was played out after 'Return of the King.' There are a lot of bad guys, a lot of good guys, and sooner or later they're all gonna meet on the battlefield. The little details are not-so-shockingly unimportant, since nothing could stop, change or even, really, comment on the unstoppable trajectory of this film's story.It's the future. An Evil Corporation is parked on distant planet Pandora, mining the planet of all its precious minerals. The native population, big blue humanoids called the 'Na'vi,' aren't too happy about this. The corporation has hired scientists to create avatars of Na'vi bodies to be controlled by human brains, in order to communicate to the Na'vi that...they better move, lest be bulldozed by the evil Col. Qautrich (Stephen Lang).Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is flown in to Pandora because his twin brother, who had an Avatar made specifically for him, is dead. The coincidence is an obvious plot device so that we can have a newcomer to Pandora to share in our amazement. Oh, and he's paralyzed, so running around in his new alien body is rather freeing for him.I don't feel as if I need to continue with the plot description. You know what'll happen. You've seen 'Dances with Wolves' and 'The Last Samurai.' Heck, even 'Dead Man.' The Na'vi represent nature, the (all-American) corporation represents destructive technology. Quatrich has a Southern accent and says things like, 'we have to fight terror with terror.' The Na'vi are clones of Native Americans - filtered through the imagination of a white liberal. It's all very obvious.The question, of course, is whether or not it's entertaining. Well...sometimes. It certainly looks good. Some sequences - especially those with the winged beasts - are eye-popping. Lang makes a fun villain. Pandora is more derivative than original, it reminded me most of Skull Island in Peter Jackson's King Kong. All the monsters have a plastic-y look to them that make them feel too well-done. The 3D is distracting at times and I had a headache before the movie was over.But there are scenes and individual shots that pop with ethereal beauty. It's worth seeing for that reason, but I don't think it'll be as fun after multiple viewings. The great thing about 'Star Wars' was the characters: Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, R2-D2, Darth Vader, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda and so on. They embodied the other-worldliness of the story, taking the weight off the effects.In thirty-two years, I don't think anyone will remember 'Jake Sully.' 6/10",6,400,710,1 January 2010
The Last Samurai," Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune would be proud...
","...'The Last Samurai' is an epic adventure/war film in the eve of 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Gladiator'.  The large-scale plot focuses on a Captain Nathan Algren, an American haunted by his violent past, who travels to Japan to teach them how to use 'new' firearms in a battle, specifically a battle against an army of samurai, led by the fierce Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). After an early battle, the Japanese army is massacred by the samurai, and Algren is captured.  He is brought to the samurai's home, where he heals from his wounds and talks to Katsumoto about the Japanese army and Katsumoto's rebellion.  Eventually Algren realizes he was on the wrong side, and joins Katsumoto to fight against the Japanese army (all the while learning the way of the samurai).As epics go, the cinematography, choreography, writing and direction are all...well, large would be the word that comes to mind.  Huge battles, long, beautiful shots; talks of honor, etc.  Coincidentally, the screenplay was penned by the same writer who did 'Gladiator', John Logan.  I must say, this guy loves making his subject honor, which is good.  The two movies were very exciting, thrilling, and entertaining.Another thing great about this movie is the acting.  This is definitely one of Tom Cruise's better films.  Of course, Cruise is hardly the gem of this movie, because Watanabe steals the show.  Every scene he's in, no matter what actor or character is there with him, your eyes are glued to his face. His presence is astounding, you'd swear his emotions were genuine.  I really hope he walks home with the Oscar this year.'The Last Samurai' deserved every Oscar nom it got, and then some (come on...Seabiscuit?), 8.5/10.",Null,0,1,9 February 2004

","This is the best movie that I've ever seen!  The dialogue is fast and furious, the action - despite how little action there is - is brilliantly filmed, and the acting is fabulous on all parts.The story, as many of you probably already know, follows four criminals taking refuge in a warehouse after a bloody diamond heist.  In the aftermath, Mr. Pink convinces them that one of them has to be an undercover cop, because the cops got to them way to fast.The four nameless criminals are Mr. White, a hot-tempered veteran (Harvey Keitel). Mr. Orange, a young guy, new into the business, who was shot after the heist and is severely injured (Tim Roth).  Mr. Blonde, a calmly psychotic 'crowd controller' who has recently been released from prison (Michael Madsen) and Mr. Pink,  a cowardly little weasel looking out for his own best interests (Steve Buscemi).The acting is definitely the prime jewel of this movie.  All roles are done perfectly and totally believably, namely by Michael Madsen and Steve Buscemi.  Madsen delivers a terrifying performance as Mr. Blonde, especially in the infamous 'ear scene' in which Blonde dances to seventies tunes while hacking a cop's ear off!

Hoosiers," Good but not involving enough

Out of all of the sports films I've seen, there are three I can recommend: this one, 2001's 'Remember the Titans' and 2004's 'Miracle'. The best part of the latter two was that they succeeded in a balancing act of getting to know the coaches intimately as well as the players (though a good majority of the players in 'Remember the Titans' were caricatures). 'Hoosiers' biggest problem is that we only get to know the coaches, and all the players are just vaguely different variations of the same person.This makes the film's basketball scenes quite boring to watch because of how little we care for the players. It seems that the writer was writing so much about the coaches that he forgot about the players and tried to make up for it by adding little traits in a vain attempt to make them more interesting. One is a Jesus freak. One is inconveniently short. I couldn't tell you anything about the rest.Except, there is one interesting player in this movie. And no, it's not the 'main' player, Jimmy Chitwood (Maris Valainis). No, we don't even get to know him. Instead, it's the character of Everett Flatch (David Neidorf), who plays the son of the Dennis Hopper character, a moronic drunk. We see the pain in his eyes when his father is drunk, and the disappointment when he's not able to coach right for a big game. We see how this affects him during the game, but what's more, we care.Once you look past the shallowness of the players' characters and the blandness of the basketball scenes, 'Hoosiers' is actually pretty good. Gene Hackman's performance as the tough new coach to the small town basketball team is the film's best aspect, though I personally would've liked it if he was a little meaner. Barbara Hershey is fine as the female lead and sort-of love interest to Hackman's character but her character isn't interesting enough for us to care whether Hackman ends up with her, or if he doesn't, or if she dies in a tragic bowling accident (really).Dennis Hopper was nominated for his only acting Oscar for this movieand, well, at least we can say he only has one undeserved acting nomination. He overacts to a glorious point as the drunk, climbing the ladder of parody and then jumping off to the next side near the end. He is a caricature; everything from the way he slurs to the way he moves is like a cartoon drawing of a drunk. And I like Hopper too, but this is not one of his high points.Watch the film for Hackman's performance, and for a few interesting and tense scenes, but for nothing else, 7/10.",Null,1,8,13 July 2004
Pulp Fiction," The Best
","I personally don't think any single movie should be called 'The Best'. There are 'The Bests', including movies like 'The Godfather', 'American Beauty' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but I've always thought that there was no 'Best' movie.Then I saw 'Pulp Fiction'...and if I had to name any movie as 'The Best', this would definitely be it.The plot has three different stories, intersecting and coming apart.  The first and main stories has hit men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson) recovering a case for their boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), and a subplot about Vince taking Marsellus' wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out for some fun.  The second story has prizefighter Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) being pursued by Marsellus for refusing to throw a fight - the two fall into some disturbing chaos.  The last and smallest plot is about two petty crooks (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer) who decide to rob the diner that they're having breakfast in.I haven't mentioned this yet, but the film is written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  After this and 'Reservoir Dogs' I think it's safe to say that he's one of the greatest writers of our time.  His lines manage to be cool but don't get too artificial like David Mamet's or slogan-like like William Goldman's (who are both still great).  His stories are the most creative of creative writing, his lines are awesome, his characters brilliant.And brilliant they are.  My personal favorite character is Jackson's cool, foul mouthed, Bible quoting hit man who has a religious experience after surviving what seems to be a now-way-out gunfight.  Jackson's performance is spot on, perfect, nothing beats this kind of acting.My second favorite is Butch.  Bruce Willis isn't a good actor - most of the time.  Thank God for movies like this, 'Die Hard' and '12 Monkeys' for the guy to show his abilities.  His performance is perfect, Oscar worthy all the way.Speaking of the Oscars, it's a pity this didn't dominate.  If I had it my way it would've picked up Best Picture, Director, Actor (Travolta), Supporting Actor (Jackson), Supporting Actress (Thurman) and Best Editing, instead of Tarantino just getting one for the screenplay.  Oh, and Bruce Willis would get a nom for himself.The Best of The Best, 10/10.",Null,0,2,29 March 2004
The Godfather: Part III," A good movie, despite a few bad elements...
","...'The Godfather: Part III' is the last movie in one of the best (or the best) dramatic trilogies of all time.  As many already know, this one focuses solely on Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) and his struggles for the Corleone family to become legitimate (he's been longing for so since the first film).  Many bad things happen, including a corrupt Archbishop (Donal Donelly) and hotshot enemy Joey Zasa (Joe Mentegna).  Helping Michael is Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia, in what may be his best performance) and sister Connie (Talia Shire).Of course, this isn't on the same level as the first two.  There are many bad elements in the writing and some in the acting.  For one thing, Puzo and Coppola really seemed to love making references to the first two films, most of which are unnecessary.  Example: at one point Michael shows his son (Franc D'Ambrosio) the very same picture that he drew as a child in Part II. This had very little relevance to the plot, and put it this way, if this small part hadn't been included in Part II, do you think a similar scene would be written for III?  I think no.The acting, well, it has it's ups and downs.  Pacino does well as always, but it's his worst performance of the trilogy.  As many say, Sophia Coppola is 'terrible' and 'awful'.  Now, she's not by any means good, but I'd say the worst performance comes from both Mentegna (who never changes his facial expression or the tone of his voice) and D'Ambrosio.  What was with D'Ambrosio's song?  It was like 'The Godfather: The Music Video'.There is some very good acting too though.  As I said, Garcia does incredibly well.  The way he acts, he sells the character perfectly.  Also, Donnelly does a creepily good job.  An underrated and very well-done performance is Eli Wallach's as the cunning Don Altobella.  The man was seventy-five when he did this film, and yet he has so much energy and life. If Strasberg and Gazzo can be nominated for Part II, Wallach sure as hell can be for this one (not to mention he's been deserving since 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly').The direction is also fine.  Coppola's use of still cam and tan shading is admirable.  The ending shots are flawless.So, not the greatest film of the trilogy, far from it, but still quite enjoyable, 8/10.",Null,1,2,6 February 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Not as accomplished as the first, but still a fair sequel
","The biggest flaw of 'The Matrix Reloaded' can be summed up with three letters: CGI.  It's that simple.  Unlike the first, 'Reloaded' uses way too much CGI, taking away the 'real' effect of all the fight scenes from the first.  There are still some fights in 'Reloaded' that are CGI-less, and they turned out to be the best ones.  Neo (Keannu Reeves) fights the Oracle's (Gloria Foster) bodyguard Seraph (Colin Chou) one-on-one, and that happened to be the best fight scene in the entire film.The fight that everyone was waiting for, the 'Burly Brawl' (in which Neo takes on dozens of Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving and a whole lot of stunt doubles) looks to fake.  Neo looks like plastic, and the Smiths look no better.  Also, it goes into too many slow motion shots, causing it to become a little to long-winded.Also, the acting that was almost perfect from the first is taken down a notch in the second.  Even Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is goofy sometimes. The best performance, again, comes from Weaving as Smith, who in 'Reloaded' is more sinister and comical than the first.  Weaving uses his eyes to terrify you, the same trick he used in 'The Matrix'.Overall it's a good action movie, still can't wait for 'Revolutions', 8/10.",Null,0,0,5 July 2003
Mystic River," One of the best films of the year, on my Top 10, definitely!
","I went to see 'Mystic River' for a few reasons.  Firstly, I like to see the Oscar Nominees before the Oscars, so I know what is really deserving on the Osar night.  I also wanted to know how much competition 'Lord of the Rings' had, and how much competition Bill Murray and Djimon Hounsou had, in their nominated categories.  I wasn't expecting anything amazing, just the usual Oscar-contending type of movie.I left the theater amazed at such a great film.  I wasn't expecting much, and its power and magnitude totally surprised me (though I don't know why, I loved Eastwood's 'Unforgiven').  Everything...everything about this movie was top notch filmmaking.  Eastwood's direction was great, his best film I think.  The screenplay was admirable, and the acting, well, the acting was the best part.  Now, I realize that Eastwood probably worked great with his actors, but watching them mingle and talk to each other on-screen...well, they're on their own level.The story of 'Mystic River' focuses on three childhood friends, Jimmy, Dave and Sean, who's lives are torn apart when Dave is kidnapped by child molesters (in one of the most tragic, disturbing scenes in recent memory). Dave escapes, but they're permanently seperated...that is, until they're in their thirties, many years later.  Jimmy (Sean Penn) is an criminal-turned-family man who runs his own business now, Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a police detective with a wife who calls him but says nothing, and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a bar-hopping, depressed man who tries his best to love his family, but has never quite healed from the incident in the past.  When tragedy occurs and Jimmy's daughter is found murdered, the three are brought together, though not as friends.And from their, the story takes off.  There are many twists, turns, surprises and shocks, one of the better mystery movies.  The supporting cast gives it their all too, with Laurence Fishburne, Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden - in what is, along with 'Miller's Crossing', her best performance.Other things worth mentioning: Penn's versatility - I've seen this guy playing so many different characters, he's really an amazing actor.  I wouldn't mind if he beat Murray at this year's Academy Awards.  Also, Robbins' performance was notable, though if he wins...I'd be disappointed (Djimon Hounsou did very well this year).  Bacon is likable for once, and, of course, Eli Wallach's fiery cameo appearance - the guy's what, eighty-seven?  I can't believe the guy's energy...Tuco never dies!And things I didn't like too much - the revelation of who the killer is.  I liked how they did it, but I thought making that person the real killer was kind of...a bad decision (but by then it was unimportant I guess).Definitely one of the best of the year, a recommendation to all, 8.5.",8,0,0,21 February 2004
Die Hard," The best claustrophobic action movie ever made
","'Die Hard' started an entire genre of movies.  The 'hostage in building who turns out to be a cop' genre.  All of the plane hostage movies, the building hostage movies, the boat hostage movies, they all evolved from 'Die Hard', but not one of them matches its brilliance.Sure, the plot is on the thin side, but you cant have an incredibly complex plot if the movie story only spans a few hours, takes place on one set, and is about a cop stopping hostage takers.  The plot is as thick as a movie like this needs to be, and the action is A+.  From John McClane's (Bruce Willis) first fight with a nerdy German terrorist to the ending shootout, Die Hard delivers one of the greatest action movies of all time.Willis' McClane is clever, hot-tempered and funny.  He is the perfect action hero, and even beats the likes of Stallone and Schwarzenneger.  Alan Rickman steals the show as the lead villain, Hans Gruber.  Hopefully, the sinister Gruber will go down in history as one of the best movie villains ever.Incredibly funny, entertaining action flick, 8.5/10.",Null,1,1,5 July 2003
Love Actually," The best holiday film in years
","It's curious that Richard Curtis' `Love Actually' is so good, because it doesn't present anything new to the audience.  Pretty much all of the eight or so different love stories have been seen many times before in hundreds, if not thousands of holiday movies.  I think the reason for its surprising greatness lies in the writing, the performances and the characters.  My point is, `Love Actually' proves that for a holiday romantic comedy, it's okay if the plot is filled to the brim with clichés, as long as the writing, performances and characters are well done.I'll list all of the plot lines I can think of, though I may miss a few (there are many).  First we have the Prime Minister of Britain (where the film is set, by the way), played by Hugh Grant, who falls in love with his secretary (Martine McCutcheon).  The prime minister's sister Karen's (Emma Thompson) husband Harry (Alan Rickman), who is drawn to his seductive assistant Mia (Heike Makatsch).  Their friend Sarah (Laura Linney), shyly in love with her co-worker Karl (Rodrigo Santoro).  Recent widower Daniel (Liam Neeson), trying to help his step-son (Thomas Sangster) confront his school love.  A writer (Colin Firth) who found his     friend cheating on him and moved to Brazil to fall in love with his maid Aurelia (Lucia Moniz).  Mark (Andrew Lincoln), who is in love with his best friend's new wife (Keira Knightley).  John (Martin Freeman) and Judy (Joanna Page) meet while they work as stand-ins for an       film, and love flourishes.  There's also Colin (Kris Marshall), who believes that if he goes to America he'll find  a lot quicker and easier than he would in Britain.  I think I've tackled them all.If any of these stories had a movie of their own they would probably be boring and almost impossible to sit through because of how over used the clichés are.  For some reason putting them all in the same film helps, most likely because director Curtis knows that he's working with clichés and revels in them.  Of course, few of the characters are very well developed, but they're very fun characters so it's hard to notice.This does present a few flaws though.  Like, say, Linney's character isn't very dimensional so it's hard to completely accept her story's sort of sad-end.  We don't know why she doesn't do what she should do, but if we got to know her better then, maybe, we would.  I think that some of the stories, like that of Linney's, Firth's and the out-of-place satirical story of the Colin character going to America could very well have been left out.But the other stories are great.  Hugh Grant is very charming and witty in his role, reminding all of us of that other Grant from a long time ago, Cary.  Liam Neeson's story is sweet, he presents a sort of easy-going, fatherly love to his step-son.  Alan Rickman is terrific as the lawyer who acts cynical and tired to hide his obvious affection for his assistant, and Emma Thompson is also great as his wife, slowly catching on to his affair and trying to deal with it with dignity and sense.  The smaller parts, like Knightley's and Sangster's, are well played too.It is mandatory for an ensemble piece like this to have a scene-stealer, and here that part goes to Bill Nighy as the shaky, randy, cynical former rock artist whose trying to make his new Christmas song number one for Christmas. His story is kind of in the background to the others' foreground, but it is the best part of the film.  Nighy is hilarious, with perfect timing and mannerisms, effortlessly keeping our attention in every scene.  He is perfectly written and perfectly played.  The performance is worthy of an Oscar, the same Oscar that went to the undeserving Tim Robbins (boo!).`Love Actually' is the best holiday film to come out in years, so I think it should've been enjoyed by families.  The        and some of the swearing could've been easily removed, and the film would be a perfect family gem. But I guess we have everything, it's still great how it is.Sure, it's fluff, but it's admirable fluff, 8/10.",Null,0,2,9 August 2004
Wedding Crashers," Watchable, if over-hyped
","One of the most unnerving things about 'Wedding Crashers' is that the two leads are just as sleazy and despicable as the film's villain, but we're suddenly supposed to sympathize with them because they've found girls they like. What these two need is comeuppance...but leave that to a darker comedy, I guess. So try to forget about that while you're watching it.John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) crash weddings to meet, seduce and dump girls. They've got it worked out to a system, which is humorous because it's believable. But John is having second thoughts about their irresponsible, even hurtful lifestyle. Then at a wedding they meet the Cleary sisters (Rachel McAdams and Isla Fisher) and fall for them. The two sisters are immediately accepting of them, and invite them out to their rich father's summer cottage.The father is played by Christopher Walken, and it's probably the first time in this guy's career that he's been underused. Who the hell under-uses Christopher Walken? He's there to be overused! The strange thing is that it's clear the filmmakers know how to be funny...there are many funny moments, and Vince Vaughn is hilarious. But there are so many gaps between the really good jokes, and the writer gets lazy when he resorts to the phoned-in gay and T&A jokes. And lots of great comedic opportunities are missed, as when Walken walks in on Vaughn after he's been tied to the bed by Walken's horny daughter. This could've been the funniest scene in the movie, but instead, nothing happens.Vince Vaughn is probably the movie's biggest success. He manages to do what Jack Lemmon did in 'Some Like it Hot': to create a believable, funny character and also establish a personality for himself for movies to come. The performance is not as memorable as Lemmon's, because the movie isn't as memorable (not by a mile), but Lemmon's got an Oscar nod, and I do think Vaughn deserves some consideration.The movie's lack of morals hurt it as well. John and Jeremy never feel even slightly sorry for their deeds, and hypocritically exploit the wrongs of Claire's silly evil fiancé Sack. Characters as dark as these are only really funny in movies with some sort of moral message or point, the message here seems to be 'do what you want, worry only about yourself'. But I guess it seems to be the general agreement these days that a movie with morals can't be funny.The movie's sleazy, terribly uneven, and almost like a collection of missed opportunities, with a great performance from Vaughn and funny parts here and there.6.5/10",6,0,1,29 August 2005
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Its thrilling climax makes this a good one...
","...'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is a multi-character tale set in WWII and focusing mostly on a large number of POWs in a Japanese prison camp.  In charge of the camp is Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), an angry, almost merciless leader who has troubles of his own.  Inside the camp - leading the British prisoners - is Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness), a strong-willed, by the book patriot.  Other characters include a major posing as a commander who recently escaped the camp (William Holden), and an honest, hard working doctor working there (James Donald).The plot is set in motion when Nicholson is ordered by Saito to have his soldiers build a bridge at the camp and Holden's character is sent to destroy it.  It may seem unimportant, the whole movie about a bridge, but the way the characters grow obsessed over it is incredibly well done.Most notably is Guinness' performance as the stubborn Nicholson who sees the bridge as his signature in history, all the while ignoring the fact that he's really helping his enemy.  Guinness took home a well deserved Best Actor Oscar for his role in this.Also great are Hayakawa and Holden.  Hayakawa was nominated for an Oscar for this, and it is deserved, what could've been a cartoonish villain is presented in full, a truly three dimensional character.  Holden puts forth as well, his character so reluctant and angry to be on his mission.David Lean's direction here is great too, his talent for adventure shown in the gripping climax when all the major characters meet in an exciting, suspensful and ultimately tragic climax.A classic film, I recommend, 8.5/10.",Null,1,3,24 April 2004
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Way too long. Francis, this is Dracula, not The Godfather!
","'Bram Stoker's Dracula', for its subject matter, is just too long.  Come on...it's a movie about a vampire and a vampire hunter and a love story...no need for its monstrous length.  It just crams so much pointless storyline into not-to-be-taken-seriously film, with the actors speaking pseudo-Shakespearean lines...its just not worth it.The performances are good though, Anthony Hopkins putting forth the most, playing a very cool Van Helsing - better than Hugh Jackman.  Winona Rider is pretty good, as is Gary Oldman, and Keannu Reeves isn't as bad as usual. The worst part is Francis Ford Coppola's direction.  It's just too self-loving.  He's really made nothing very good since 'The Godfather: Part II'.Nonetheless, the climax is both very fun and very exciting.  Surprising that Coppola filmed such a great action sequence, it was like a combination of a good western with a great chariot race.To me this movie is floating around somewhere in between 6.5 and 7, but I'll give it a 7 out of 10 for its performances.",Null,0,1,8 April 2004
Con Air," Good action movies that at least has three things going for it...
","Yes, if there are only three positive things about this film they'd be:1) The Action: This being a Jerry Bruckheimer action movie, you can count on that.  From the scene where the prisoners escape there bonds to the ending motorcycle/fire truck chase, the action amazes to say the least.2) The Villain: John Malkovich is always able to play a good psycho, but his 'Cyrus the Virus' is my personal favorite.  Cyrus kills without thinking twice and takes pleasure in infuriating the DEA officers after the captured plane.3) Steve Buscemi Veteran character actor Buscemi plays Hannibal Lecter-type convict Garland 'The Marrietta Mangler' Greene.  Greene spews philosiphy and provides bizarre comic relief as action hero Nicolas Cage fumbles his fake Southern accent over and over again.Aside from Malkovich and Buscemi, the acting in Con Air isn't exactly perfect, but hey, it's an action movie.Okay action, 7/10.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
The Green Mile," Makes you want to cry, makes you want to laugh, makes you want to smile, one of the greatest!
","'The Green Mile' should be in the thesaurus as a synonym for 'amazing'.  The story it tells is one of the saddest, heartwarming, most brilliant ever told (and I don't mean just in movies).  Everything about this movie is perfect, it literally has no flaws.  Yes, some may complain about the running time, but anything shorter wouldn't have been able to tell the story right. Truly, I doubt anyone could put up a good argument that this isn't a terrific film.The [brilliant] story focuses on death row guard Paul (Tom Hanks) and how he copes with his job - executing the inmates.  Everything is regular until gentle giant John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives with a death sentence for the rape and murder of two little girls.  Coffey is an unlikely pedophile/killer - he's afraid of the dark, he cries in his sleep, he speaks with an innocence as if he's never come in real contact with a person before.  Seeing this, Paul starts to question whether or not Coffey committed the crime he was sentenced with.Paul is also suffering from a bladder infection, one day, when its really bad, Coffey grabs him, touches him, and then he's healed!  He does the same for a pet mouse crushed by the villain Percy (Doug Hutchison).  It is thought that maybe Coffey was trying to heal the two dead girls he was found with.And so starts this great, great film.  Every cast member puts forth.  There are some great side performances from Michael Jeter, David Morse and Patricia Clarkson - but don't get me wrong, there isn't one bad performance in this movie.Of course, the greatest comes from Duncan, playing a sad, hulking simpleton often drenched in his own tears.  This is the performance of a lifetime for Duncan - who is now unfortunately wasting his talent on 'Daredevil' and 'See Spot Run'.  He was nominated for an Oscar for this film, but Michael Caine beat him.  This is an outrage, Caine always plays the sympathetic British guy.  Duncan's performance is one of the greatest I've ever seen.This movie is one of the most touching, sad movies I've ever seen, watch it, 9/10.",Null,1,2,3 April 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Well, it's good....
","'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith' is possibly the most anticipated movie of the year. And by possibly I mean definitely.I'm not sure why, though. Episodes I and II were okay, but nothing even approaching 'special'. I suppose the appeal of the Star Wars movies is that it makes one - anyone - feel like a little child again. It brings you back to the days when you weren't embarrassed to care about what happens to your favorite super-hero, or have long conversations about whether Gandalf would win, or Obi-Wan, in a fight.These are movies that are just lots of fun.And Episode III is much, much more fun than I and II, and even a little touching, at times (but just a little). The action seems endless, which is good, because it is like nothing we've ever seen before. The dialogue scenes in I and II that were...for lack of a better word, 'harsh', are still harsh, but much shorter, fewer and far between. Thankfully.The problem with Lucas' writing is that the characters speak in subtext, in feelings. The characters never use any form of wit or subtlety in speaking, they are as blunt as a fist. Though, Ian McDiarmid as the evil Sen. Palpatine has his moments.The Galaxy is at war. The seemingly 'peaceful' Republic with its opponent, the Separatist droid army, led by droid General Grievous, Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and his master, Darth Sidious, whose identity is sort of concealed, even though we all know who he is. The film starts with Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin (Hayden Christensen) rescuing Palpatine from the clutches of Grievous, a half-droid, half-alien soldier whose part in this film is somewhere between window dressing and completely pointless.So they save Palpatine (or did they?), and Anakin and him grow closer, which is bad, because Palpatine has a few dangerously dark secrets. The rest is too complicated to explain, but the key players are Anakin, Obi-Wan, Anakin's secret pregnant wife Padme (Natalie Portman), Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz) and Palpatine.When I say that the rest is too complicated to explain, I don't mean that it is hard to understand, or anything like that, just that the movie is more about thrills, special effects, battles, and a character study of young Anakin that is surprisingly well-done (Lucas wrote something good! Wow!).I have one qualm about the special effects, though. The prequel episodes were made a quarter of a century after the originals, so they are far more advanced technically, but does that make sense, to the chronology of the series? Wouldn't the technology in Episodes IV, V and VI be more advanced, because they take place after? I suspect that kids watching these movies a decade from now will be confused.Anyway, it's not that important. Just lose yourself in the movie, and ignore the dialogue. There are some sequences of pure grandeur, intensity, and excitement, like Palpatine's sickly transformation into the Emperor we all know, a duel on an unstable lava planet, and a duel between two characters who we've all wanted to see in battle for a long time. That we know that neither of these characters dies until three movies later lessens the suspense a little, but it is still exciting.Others are a little more contrived, like the character of Grievous, and the appearance of everyone's favorite Wookie, Chewbacca. The sole reason for his three seconds of film is so that we can say, 'Look, there's everyone's favorite Wookie, Chewbacca!' Oh, and Samuel L. Jackson is completely wasted.But yeah, the movie is fun. Good, even. Worth seeing once or twice. But nothing to get really worked up over. Just a movie.7.5/10",7,2,5,20 May 2005
Ray," The best biopic I've ever seen...
","...now, I'm not a huge fan of biopics. By biopics I mean a story about the entire life of a person, not just a small part of it (I don't consider the astounding 'The Straight Story' a biopic, for instance). Most of the time they're endless, boring and uninteresting. The huge revelation of most biopics is either that the person was a monster in real life or that s/he was pathetic and should be pitied ('A Beautiful Mind'). Either that or s/he was a great, amazing person with no flaws ('The Hurricane').'Ray' - about influential singer Ray Charles Robinson - does none of that. It shows Robinson as a great man with two major flaws - addictions to heroin and women. This does not turn him into an evil person - no, he is a great man, and he loves his family very much, but he just can't stop sinning.'Ray' is smart in that it doesn't show only Ray's problems or only his feats. The movie is balanced extremely well in Ray's flaws and his astounding achievements against blindness, his influence in American culture, and his love for his family. He was a great man, and the movie lets us know him very well.So well that I haven't even mentioned the name of the actor who portrays him! It is Jamie Foxx, veteran of lots of comedy crap. Is this ever a good year for him. His work in 'Collateral' was a revelation, he amazed me in that movie, one of the best performances of the year. And then here we have what's possible THE best performance of the year. Jamie Foxx's performance as Ray is so perfect, he has it down, Foxx is Charles, that's all there is to say. All of his movements, lines, actions...they're just perfect.The supporting cast is admirable too. We get to know Ray's mother (Sharon Warren), wife (Kerry Washington) and longtime mistress (Regina King) the best, and all three give award-worthy performances (especially Warren, who was so powerful and effective as the mother). We don't learn all that much about any of the male supporting characters, but not a single bad performance is given, and they all (including Clifton Powell, Richard Schiff and the amazingly talented Warwick Davis) give a great impression.The off-screen talent is high, too. The direction and cinematography are superb, the writing is great, and the costumes, sets and makeup are all, well, perfect.But the gem of the movie is Foxx. He may not have been the first choice for many, but after seeing this, I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. This is an exceptional movie, I have little doubt that the Academy will honor it.8/10.",Null,1,2,1 November 2004
Stalag 17," A great film headed by a classic director and strong star William Holden
","William Holden is always in the shadows in `Stalag 17', he's always behind the characters or off to the side of the camera.  You see, despite Holden's character Sgt. J.J. Sefton being the film's main character, he is only seen through the eyes of his fellow POWs, rarely ever alone.  When they start to think he's the spy so do we.  Oh, sure, we know he isn't the rat (movies don't do things like that), but since the story is told by all of the POWs who think Sefton is the rat, we start to think like them too.  That is the mastery of Billy Wilder's `Stalag 17', it takes the film's most interesting character and sets him apart from the rest for most of the film, letting us learn about him as the characters do.The story focuses on a group of POWs living in the American section of Stalag 17, supposedly the     's best POW camp.  Among them are barracks chief Hoffy (Richard Erdman), Price (Peter Graves), Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck) and Animal Casava (Robert Strauss).  They all have their own special job when their fellow prisoners try to escape, Price, for instance, is security'.  The film starts when two prisoners try to escape the barracks. Everyone inside is enthused, thinking the two will make it very far, except Sefton, who bets precious cigarettes that they wont make it past the outer forest.  When he turns out to be right the POWs start thinking there's a rat and that rat is Sefton.  And as the first hour passes we think so too, it's only logical, Sefton has any luxuries because of his deals with the s.The POWs start to bully Sefton, and once they beat him to a pulp he decides to discover who the real rat is (at this point, of course, we know he is     ).  His investigation isn't handled with dialogue though, we get this by seeing his facial expressions and his lurking in the shadows of the barracks.So, what starts as a light, `gung-ho' type war movie (there's lots of comedy in the first hour) turns into a dark, sort of gritty thriller with a twist that left me with my mouth open.  I wont reveal it, but I'll just say that Sefton smartly solves the mystery and redeems himself to the rest of the barracks (I didn't spoil anything, come on, it's expected).As I said, there's lots of comedy in the first hour and some in the second, mostly from Strauss and Lembeck's characters.  Some of the comedy is key in showing how these characters cope with their nearly hopeless situation, handled well by Wilder and the actors (Strauss' performance even gained him an Oscar nomination) but some of it just seems tacked on and out of place, like when a drunken Strauss thinks that Lembeck is a hell.But that is a small qualm, and the rest of the film is excellent.  The direction and writing are great in showing us a war film, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy all at once.  I'd have to say I like the acting the most though, Holden (who won a leading Oscar for his work in this) is suave and charming, as well as mischievous and cynical, he creates a real `cool' character without trying too.  And the rest of the cast - Graves, Otto Preminger - are admirable as well.  The POWs aren't clichés or caricatures, they're all their own separate people.`Stalag 17' is great as a war movie, a mystery, a thriller and a dark comedy.  It's a classic film, for all who appreciate good cinema, 8.5/10.",Null,67,77,4 August 2004
The Terminal," A happy movie, lots of fun...
","'The Terminal' is the latest Hanks/Spielberg collaboration, and though it's not quite as good as 'Catch Me if You Can' or 'Saving Private Ryan' it still makes for a fun watch. The plot, as everyone already knows, is about Krakozhian (sp?) immigrant Victor Narvorski (Tom Hanks) whose home country  the fictional land of Krakozhia (think Russia or Czechoslovakia)  is torn apart in war while he is in a plane headed for New York. When he lands JFK airport head Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tells him that since he literally doesn't have a country he must stay in the airport terminal until all the hoopla settles. Dixon thinks that Narvorski will ignore him, escape into New York and 'become someone else's problem'. What Dixon doesn't know is that Victor is an honest man, and he will obey the rules and stay in the terminal until he's allowed to leave.The character of Victor Narvorski is one of those classic movie characters who has no conceivable flaw (other than a minimal understanding of the world around him  and an accent) and dose everything he can to help everyone else. Similar characters that spring to mind are Peter Sellers' Chauncey Gardner from the 1979 satire 'Being There' and John Goodman's Charlie Meadows from the Coen movie 'Barton Fink'. All of these characters are dim-witted, but great people who put their own lives on hold to help their friends.Some of these friends include Airport worker Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), who Victor helps get hitched with a beautiful security guard (Zoë Saldana) and Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a nice, flighty flight attendant who Narvorski inspires to get out of a troubled relationship with a married man.The Hanks and Zeta-Jones characters strike up a little romance, but luckily its not too overblown, it's more of a subplot than anything.It takes sometime but soon Narvorski is accepted into a small group of Airport workers including Cruz, kindly Joe Mulroy (Chi McBride) and janitor Gupta Raja (Kumar Pallana), who at first thinks that Narvorski is a federal agent out to get him. These characters are all well written and even better acted, but I thought they could've been awarded with a little more screen time. After all, the three are very good actors. But I guess Luna is still riding off the success of 'Y U Mama Tambien' and McBride, despite the fact that he's been working for many years, is still trying to find a big role that's right for him (which I doubt he'll get from 'I, Robot').It's Pallana who has the biggest role here, and man, does he deserve it. Very old, and very foreign, he was brought to surprising cult fame when Wes Anderson gave him the role of 'Pagoda' in the 2001 hit 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. Who doesn't remember the short, quiet, hilarious butler of the Tenenbaum family? His role in this is a great follow-up; he is funny, and surprisingly touching and dramatic in a very tense scene near the end that I wont spoil. In any other movie the role of the Indian janitor would be an easy target, but this character isn't funny because he's Indian, but instead funny because he's clever, a little cynical and wily. He stole every scene he's in from under Tom Hanks, or Zeta-Jones, or whoever. This is a long shot, but I think the man deserves an Oscar nomination.The acting in this movie is the greatest factor  well, that and the huge Terminal set built only for the movie. Some critics are complaining about an underwritten and underused Catherine Zeta-Jones. Whatever. I call her under-necessary (Note: not UNnecessary, UNDER-necessary). I'm glad that her less-than-interesting character wasn't overused, I'm glad the movie wasn't turned into a straight-out romance.The films deepest and most interesting character is Tucci's Dixon. On the surface he looks like your usual villain, but that's only to simpleton viewers who don't make any attempt to understand their movie characters. Dixon is not a villain. As it's established in the beginning, Dixon has been working the same job at the airport for seventeen years and wants desperately to climb up the latter. Because of this, he makes sure that he follows every single rule; he's the epitome of every by-the-book bureaucrat that we all love to hate. His motto is that in his work there're three important things, 'The person, the document and the story'. In the best scene of the movie Dixon refuses a Russian man to bring medicine to his dying father in Canada because he doesn't have the right form. This scene represents everything about the character of Dixon.I was also interested in the relationship between Dixon and Narvorski. Dixon is at first refusing Narvorski because it's the rules, but as the film goes on and Dixon is further perplexed by Narvorski it stops being about rules and starts being about hatred and jealousy for Narvorski's joyful existence. He refuses to let Narvorski go to New York when he should be allowed to. In the film's most fulfilling scene Narvorski escapes and Dixon decides to give up chasing him, and you can see in his eyes that he's realized how ridiculous and stubborn he's been acting. This is Tucci's best performance. An Oscar for him, I say!It is flawed, of course, in a few things. Narvorski's character is never developed, he stays the same person throughout the entire film, but that's fine, because Hanks keeps your interest and is at his most lovable. Also, the ending stretched on just a little bitif I had my way it would've ended with Dixon happily watching Narvorski escape in his cab, the rest could've just as easily been implied. I think the ending is a very important part of any film, and this one was  in a way  ruined.But, no movie is perfect, and I have no problem accepting this as a lighthearted picture with a few interesting characters. Have fun. 7.5/10.",Null,70,105,9 July 2004
The Shawshank Redemption," Terrific drama with great unpredictable ending
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the most touching,  thought provoking movies of all time.  With the fabulous performances from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to the amazing ending, 'Redemption' never fails to please.The story is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a small-time banker wrongfully convicted of killing his cheating wife.  He is sent to prison, where he meets Red (Morgan Freeman).  The two strike up a friendship that spans the two decades that Dufresne spends in jail.I'd imagine how hard it was for the writers to make a story that lasts over twenty years still interesting, but they do it perfectly.  From the inmates discussing different books in a library to the sinister warden (Bob Gunton) forcing Dufresne to do his dirty work, your attention is never taken away from the screen.I'd really like to explain the unpredictable ending, but that'd really spoil the experience, so go see it for yourself!  Great drama, 9/10.",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," Slow at times, but still a good FBI thriller
","'Silence of the Lambs' is well done, but personally I think Oliver Stone should have taken home Best Director Oscar for JFK instead that year.  The performances from Hopkins and Foster are of course perfect, and even Ted Levine's Buffalo Bill was well-done.The plot focuses on FBI trainee Starling (Foster) recruited by Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) to seek help from 'Hannibal the Cannibal' (Anthony Hopkins), an imprisoned psychiatrist, to find a crazed sexual killer (Ted Levine). Each performance is played to its highest point by the actor (specificly Hopkins, of course).The thing that slows this film down though are the almost endless investigation scenes.  Since we already know who the killer is at the beginning, there is little point going into so much detail on how the FBI find him - especially because it turns out they've got the wrong person anyway!.Despite some slower scenes it's still an entertaining, classic movie, 8/10.",Null,0,0,2 July 2003
Tombstone," Kilmer's best performance by far!
","Val Kilmer plays Doc Holliday in this western about Wyatt Earp's (Kurtt Russel) fight for vengeance.  Kilmer deepens his voice and plays his part perfectly, delivering one of the greatest western characters of all time.Aside from Kilmer's A+ performance, the acting is pretty good, mostly from Michael Beihn and Sam Elliot.  Kurt Russel does okay, but I'd have to say he acted better in Breakdown.Great western, 7.5/10.",Null,2,5,1 July 2003
Ben-Hur," Good...that's it, it's good
","Everyone knows about 'Ben-Hur'.  Five-year-old girls in Afghanistan know about `Ben-Hur'.  `Ben-Hur' is the first thing a baby finds out about after it's born.  I've known about `Ben-Hur' since before I can remember. Finally, I've seen it.Overrated.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  A true epic.  The greatest movie ever made, even.  In truth `Ben-Hur' is a two-hour movie trapped inside a four-hour marathon.  And man, is it tiring.The plot focuses on Judah Ben-Hur (Oscar winner Charlton Heston), a rich Jew with an American accent and a face like a cowboy, being framed by his Roman `friend' Messala (Stephen Boyd) for the accidental killing of a Roman official.  Messala's reason is to set an example to the rest of the Jews; get the message across that Rome is in charge.  He also sends Judah's sister and mother to jail, for reasons unexplained.We follow Judah as a slave, working in the gallows of a war ship under the control of Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), a Roman warrior who sounds strangely British.  Quintus works Ben-Hur to death, then takes a liking to him, and makes sure that he's not chained to the bottom of the boat while engaging in warfare with another ship.  For saving his life, Ben-Hur returns the favor when the enemy overcomes the ship.  Quintus takes Ben-Hur back to Rome and frees him of his slavery  supposedly redeeming the character, but I guess we're supposed to forget all the other slaves that died on the ship.Ben-Hur leaves Quintus  which is unfortunate because he was probably the most interesting character of the movie  and travels to his city to take vengeance on Messala.  He teams up with Esther (Hara Harareet, whose lazy eye is more interesting than her performance), the woman who he had a crush on before he became a slave, and gets help from a gaudy Arabic horse-trader, Sheik Ilderim (Oscar winner Hugh Griffith).  Tensions rise when Ben-Hur and Messala engage in a white-knuckle chariot race, where only one can come out alive.Tensions plummet when I check my VCR and realize there's still an hour left. That hour is like the falling action of the film, and Jesus is thrown in to make it more interesting, I guess.  But it isn't interesting, at all, and it just makes you think, `Where the hell did this come from?' and, `When the hell is it gonna end?'  Honestly, the last hour is completely different from the first three, and in a bad way.  And don't get me wrong, I'm all for Jesus  I'm a Christian  but a film about hardcore vengeance is not to be ended with the crucifixion.There are three times that `Ben-Hur' does achieve that excellent, epic feel though.  The first is when Judah is arrested and he traps himself inside a room with Messala, threatening him with a spear.  The scene is exciting and tense, and contains the movie's best acting (from Heston).  The second is the battle between the two boats, the crash especially, it is quite impressive for 1959.  The third is, of course, the chariot race.  Though it's a tad too long it'll still go down (or further down) in history as one of the greatest, most epic action scenes ever filmed, a title well deserved.`Ben-Hur' set the eleven Oscar win record, which has yet to be beaten (only tied).  It should have won ten.  Which win is it that was undeserved?  Hugh Griffith's Supporting Actor Oscar.  Why, why, why did he win?  This has got to be one of the most perplexing wins in Oscar history.  It isn't a bad performance  it's good  but it's just terribly un-special, and ultimately, forgettable.  Off the top of my head I can already think of a better supporting performance from 1959: Dean Martin's from Rio Bravo.  As for the other ten, well, they were deserved, even Heston's.The other four-hour epic that comes to mind is `Lawrence of Arabia', and, well, `Ben-Hur' is to `Lawrence of Arabia' what Michael Bay is to Akira Kurosawa.  The editors should've cut more.  Much more. 7.5/10.",Null,3,7,10 July 2004
Signs," Great movie!
","'Signs' is M. Night Shyamalan's most entertaining movie yet.  It stars Mel Gibson (apparently Bruce Willis wasn't available) as an ex-revrend/farmer who is finding strange patterns mowed into his lawn.  At first he thinks it's a prank, but they start appearing all over the world and soon he believes he and his family are in the middle of an alien invasion.Gibson plays his part very well, ranking up with 'Braveheart' and 'Conspiracy Theory' for great Gibson performances.  Jaquin Phoenix plays Gibson's brother, and though his performance would be more comedic than dramatic, it was still very good.  Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin play Gibson's kids, pretty well for a fourteen and eight year old.'Signs', being a Shyamalan movie, was also very suspenseful.  Especially the climax, in which the family is trapped inside their basement - and, well, I wont spoil anything else.Good sci-fi, great movie, 8/10.",Null,0,2,29 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," From the breathtaking beginning sequence to the high-octane ending, you're never let down; a worthy sequel!
","'X2' focuses on the same (and many more) characters as the first comic book film.  At the start of 'X2' it shows a fierce mutant, Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), attempt to assassinate the president.  This entire sequence is probably the best in the movie.  Nightcrawler flips, kicks, punches, 'BAMFS', leaps, and, most importantly, he entertains.When Nightcrawler escapes rumors start suddenly arising about a mutant registration law.  Nervously, mutant Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) sends to of his proteges - Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Storm (Halle Berry) - to find this 'Nightcrawler' and question him.  At the same time, evil Gen. Stryker (Brian Cox) is looking for the president's permission to attack Prof. Xavier's school for mutants.There are four very fun, cool performances in 'X2'.  First, Cumming's Nightcrawler is the funniest character, his religious attitude brings humor to the moderately dark and edgy script.Second, Cox's Stryker is one of the best movie villains I've seen in a long while.  Stryker says he's hunting mutants for the safety of humans, but it clearly is just for his own agenda.  Stryker is the kind of villain to do or say something evil, but with a calm coolness that sends a chill down your spine.Third, Berry's Storm.  Just something about the 'female action heroin' that makes you like the character (they tried to do the same for Jynx in 'Die Another Day', but failed).Fourth, of course, is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.  In the first movie, Wolverine was too much of a nice guy.  That changes in 'X2', where he becomes the real Wolverine, who's not afraid to spill a little blood if it helps.  Wolverine's also a funny character, with a fierce, clever wit.In the end, 'X2' gives thrills, chills, laughs, and excitement.  Almost a perfect sequel, 8/10.",10,0,0,5 July 2003
Final Destination," Would be better if it didn't involve teens...
","...'Final Destination''s premise is original, but they definitely screwed it up having teens as the main characters.  It seems that the producers wanted bags full of fast cash instead of a quality horror movie, because cast Devon Sawa in any 'teen thriller' and 13 year old girls will rush to the theater.The story focuses on a group of teenagers 'escaping fate' by leaving an airliner before it blows up.  Soon after, fate kills them off (using creative freak accidents) in the order in which they should have been killed in the plane.  After reading that, you'd probably think it sounded like a good movie.  So did I.  Unfortunately, there are too many teen cliches to mess it up.  There's the 'popular jock', the 'mysterious gothic hot girl', the 'comic relief' and the 'pointless characters only in it to be killed off'.Despite the bad acting and teen cliches, 'Final Destination' does please, with fun eye candy and suspenseful action sequences.  Fair teen horror, 7/10.",Null,0,0,6 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The most magical, powerful, emotional and inspiring of the Lord of the Rings epic films...
","...Two years ago I had not read The Lord of the Rings and only thought the movie looked interesting because of the monsters and that guy who was in X-Men (I was only twelve) but when I seen The Fellowship of the Ring I was amazed by the level of magnitude and emotion that that film achieved.  I was immediately smitten with the epic film and started memorizing the actor names, buying the toys and reading the three books (plus The Hobbit).A year later I went to the theater opening night for The Two Towers with a ticket in my hand, ready to be amazed once again.  That night, I was disappointed.  I had just read the book and did not agree with the changes made.  But two months later I seen it again and now that I knew of the faults all I could focus on was the greatness.  The passionate performance by Bernard Hill (Theoden), the amazing effects and complexity of Gollum (Andy Serkis).  By the end of that day I liked The Two Towers even more than The Fellowship of the Ring.Now, two years later I prepared for what I thought was going to be the biggest disappointment of movie history.  As everyone knows, the third is always the worst of the trilogy.  'Return of the Jedi' and 'Matrix Revolutions' weren't necessarily bad movies, but compared to their predecessors they were unimpressive.  'The Godfather: Part III' was hammy, and who could forget the pathetic westernized 'Back to the Future III'? All disappointments.  I thought 'Return of the King' would follow their leads.I was so wrong.The plot of 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' focuses on Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) continuing journey into the dark reaches of the evil land of Mordor do destroy the One Ring, the greatest weapon in the history of Middle Earth.  As they trek into the land with the help of their conniving servant Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Theoden (Bernard Hill) plot to come to the aid of Gondor, a city besieged by countless attacks from Mordor. The three go their different ways, with Aragorn looking for aid in a ghostful army, Gandalf trying to convince Gondor steward Denethor (John Noble) to fight back and Theoden mustering his armies to come to the aid of Gondor in its most heated moment.It sounds very confusing, with the legions of characters, but with the way the story unfolds, someone who hadn't seen the first two could probably understand it.  Plus there are the subplots with female warrior Eowyn (Miranda Otto), hobbit friends Merry (Dominic Monoghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Faramir's (David Wenham) relationship with his father Denethor.The Golden Globes are moronic.  This movie has what's probably the greatest ensemble cast in film history.  The acting goes beyond perfect.  Every last actor becomes their characters.  Most notably are McKellen's Gandalf and Noble's Denethor.  McKellen - who actually gets to be in the whole movie this time - gives his best performance of the trilogy as the desperate wizard trying to help and solve the problems of all of the other characters. John Noble gives what could be the best performance of the trilogy as the steward-gone-mad, and he has what is one of the most memorable and complex scenes in a fantasy movie (I wont spoil it).  He deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar for sure, along with McKellen and Astin (who gives his best performance of the trilogy).The leads, Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortensen, also do wonderful.  Wood presents his inner struggle so well you'd be calling him Frodo if you met him in real life.  Mortensen probably did better in The Two Towers, but his role in this is notable as well.Overall, this movie conquers the fantasy genre, the adventure genre and the action genre, I recommend to anyone who wants to be entertained, 9.5/10.",10,0,0,21 December 2003
The Truman Show," A little unrealistic, but otherwise great movie
","This film is suspenseful, dramatic, funny and well-acted.  Jim Carrey plays the part of Truman Burbank, a man who's life is a television show and he's just realizing now.  That's the most unrealistic part of the movie though, that he couldn't figure it all out until now.Some of the performances, like from Linney and Emmerich, were over-acted a little.  Ed Harris plays Christof, the creator of the show.  He plays the character perfectly, so well that you can see the emotion in his eyes.Carrey acts very well too, but some of his lines sound like he's bored of being dramatic and wants to be goofy again.Good drama, 8/10.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
The Matrix," By far the best modern action movie...
","...and one of the best action movies of all time.  'The Matrix' ranks up with 'Die Hard' with its groundbreaking action and special effects.  Most call this movie a 'sci-fi' action, but it's really not.  'Sci-fi' action usually involves futuristic weapons like lasers, or Star Wars' trademark lightsabers.  Though 'The Matrix' is a sci-fi movie, the action is pure, modern day gun-fighting/martial arts.Yes, the action was terrific, but everyone knows that's not all that makes a movie.  Things like plot and acting do too, and 'The Matrix' never fails to disappoint with either.  In fact, the worst performance in the movie comes from the protagonist, Keannu Reeves, and even he doesn't do too bad.My personal favorite part of 'The Matrix' is the villain: 'Agent Smith', a simulation of a human in the fake world (or, 'matrix') who is always after the good guys.  Hugo Weaving plays Smith with the trademark slow, deep and intimidating voice, but his real talent is with his eyes.  Hugo Weaving does something with those eyes that would creep anybody out and send goosebumps up there necks.'The Matrix' never disappoints you, and if you haven't seen it yet, you don't know what you're missing, 9/10.",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
Heat," Entertaining rebirth of the cops and robbers genre
","'Heat' is a cops drama, but also a crime drama.  The stories of Lt. Vincent Hannah (Al Pacino) and robber Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) parallel each other until they meet near the end.Pacino's Hannah might be considered your cliche 'overworked cop can't spend time with his family' but if it is, Pacino still does it well.  De Niro's McCauley is strong and intimidating, but still gives off a 'polite' feel in most of his scenes.  Of course, De Niro does that in almost all of his movies.Like I said, the two act very well, especially for a cops and robbers flick. The supporting cast is also star-powered, making this film experience worth while.  Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert, Ashley Judd, Danny Trejo and Ted Levine to say a few, all play there roles like real people and not just mindless cops/robbers.'Heat' shows that robbers have friends too, with the countless (but entertaining) 'dinner scenes', showing either Hannah or De Niro sitting in a restaurant talking with friends.The message in 'Heat': cops and robbers are people too.

Fantastic Four," Not believable in any way, but fun, and not boring
","Remember the old 30s Marx Bros. comedies? The ones with Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo? Classics, right? Anyone remember the plots of those movies? Probably not...because the plots weren't important. The movies were about showcasing the abilities of the leads, while leaving the plot and conflict in the background.That's sort of like what the genre of super-hero movies is like, only the main characters' abilities aren't comedic or musical, they are, well, super. The plot doesn't matter, because you have three or four characters on screen all the time with so much energy that they upstage everything else that would be important in another movie. It is only the director and writer's task to make them interesting, and in 'Fantastic Four', Tim Story mostly succeeds at that.This film's super-heroes are Mr. Fantastic, who can stretch at enormous lengths (Iaon Gruffud); The Human Torch, who can burn at the heat of the sun (Chris Evans), The Thing, who is very strong and made of rock (Michael Chiklis); and The Invisible Woman, who is self-explanatory (Jessica Alba).They are transformed after being bombarded with a cosmic radiation storm while in a mission in space. With them is greedy billionaire Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), whose transformation is slower and more mysterious than theirs' (possibly because he is the villain).When they return to Earth their powers are revealed, and they shack up in Mr. Fantastic's apartment/office to study them. These scenes - the bulk of the movie - play as a sort of super-hero sitcom, which isn't as bad as it sounds, though a better approach would've been welcomed from me.Since there are so many powers and special effects on display at all times, the scenes never get boring, and the parts are well-played. Chris Evans and Julian McMahon are especially good, they know they're in a comic book movie and I think that brings a sort of irony to their parts.I could list the movie's flaws, and there are a lot of them...why aren't the four quarantined by the government when their powers surface? Why do they become so used to their powers so quickly? Why is the media's reaction akin to that of a new extreme sport? I mean, one of these characters can burn at the temperature of the Sun...this is a little grand-scale.But like I said, the plot isn't all-important, and the movie is much more enjoyable if you don't think of these questions. I do have a problem with the structure of the film, though. Doom establishes himself as a major villain far too late in the film, the conflict is underwhelming and his motives are unclear. There is also very, very little action. I mean, you go to a super-hero movie to see the powers, yeah, but you also want to see the powers playing off each other.But the action near the end is sensational, and the villainous Doom is so deliciously campy when he comes around that it was worth the wait. The movie is enjoyable, if flawed. But enjoyable.7.5/10",7,0,1,29 August 2005

Sin City," K-Blamo!
","Imagine if Alfred Hitchcock made a film-noir in the nineteen forties, with access to the same movie making technology that we have today. Then imagine that Quentin Tarantino co-directed. What you have imagined is 'Sin City', the new movie directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, from Miller's comic books.The movie is, in a way, an astonishment, because Rodriguez has given us no prior evidence that he is capable of directing anything better than standard stylish action shlock. Oh man, is he ever.The film takes place in Basin 'Sin' City, a Gotham-New York hybrid that probably jumped straight out of Frank Miller's nightmares. When the sky is not grey, it is red, it is always raining, and the population all seems to follow only one convention: they have a considerable amount of dirty laundry. It is as if Rodriguez reached into 'The Maltese Falcon', grabbed the city, and threw it into a vat of Gatorade - which is a compliment, of course.After a short scene at the beginning - which plays like a teaser, hinting at Sin City's nature - we are launched into three short stories, all intersecting briefly in one place: at a cheap strip joint outside the city.We start with Marv (Mickey Rourke), a massive, rough sadist whose mug looks like a cross between Mr. Incredible's and a brick. We don't know much about his past, but we know it's dirty, and that he'd probably deserve a lethal injection over a good woman. But he gets a good woman, which seems like a miracle to him, and they spend a night together. Possibly the best night of his life. When he wakes up, she's dead. He wants to find out why, who, how, and how to kill those guilty. He says his quest is 'Worth dying for, worth killing for, worth going to hell for.' Then we take a leap into Dwight's world. Dwight (Clive Owen) is running from the law, and has just hooked up with Shellie (Brittany Murphy), the girl who's loved him all her life. But Shellie's ex boyfriend Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) won't have it, and he barges into their apartment with some heavies. After a brief quibble, Jackie Boy makes his exit, violently drunk. Dwight suspects he's on his way to Old Town to inflict hell on the prostitutes who act as law there, the prostitutes who saved Dwight's life, his friends. He races off to help them.And last but not least is the story of Det. John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), one of the rare hero cops of Sin City. He saves a little girl from Junior, a pedophile (Nick Stahl). But Junior has an important dad, and Hartigan goes to prison for nearly a decade, framed for the crime. When he gets out, he races to find Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), the little girl who's now all grown up and still targeted by Junior. But Junior's gone through some disturbing changes since his last bout with Hartigan...The many characters are wide-ranging archetypes: heroes (Owen, Willis), anti-heroes (Rourke), villains (Rutger Hauer, Michael Clarke Duncan), psychos (Stahl, Del Toro, Elijah Wood), good girls (Alba, Murphy, Carla Gugino), considerably more interesting bad girls (Rosario Dawson, Devoan Aoki), and some mysterious figures (Josh Hartnett).Most of the actors are perfectly cast, some of them deliver performances worth remembering, particularly Rourke, Owen, Willis and Del Toro. They are great at taking these characters and becoming them, while still maintaining their star presence. Bruce Willis reminds us of Bruce Willis, but we remember him as John Hartigan. Del Toro, Wood and Stahl are the only actors who've been cast against type.The style of the film is what connects the three stories, as well as the strip joint, and similar themes about camaraderie, love, hate, torture and redemption. The movie is like a comic book, as we've all said, but you can only understand it if you've seen it. Then you'll agree, it feels like it was inked.Rodriguez will be remembered for this movie, and this movie will be remembered because of Frank Miller's genius and imagination. It's bloody, yeah, and it's got quite a bit of nudity, but you can't imagine the movie without it. I should hope no one would complain, because what do they expect, seeing a movie 'guest-directed' by Tarantino, the man himself. Tarantino's scene is one of the best and strangest of the movie, it involves Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, a car, some flashing lights and a 'PEZ dispenser'.I don't know if the movie will survive like 'Pulp Fiction' has, but I hope it does, because it's almost as good at combining pop culture references, homages, action, harsh violence and deep character insights into one, even narrative.The movie is a joy, a dark, neo-noir, violent, sometimes disgusting joy.9/10.",10,1,3,11 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day-Lewis saves a rather weak plot...
","...'Gangs of New York' stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Amsterdam Vallon, an Irish gangster returning to 1800s New York to kill his father's killer, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). Once there, he starts liking Bill and falls in love with thief Jenny (Cameron Diaz).  Unfortunately, this story has been done many times before.Of course, just because a story isn't new it doesn't mean it will be a bad movie.  Bill the Butcher is a truly original character who Day-Lewis plays with supreme excellence.  Bill is passionate but evil, suave but sinister. Day-Lewis overplays DiCaprio so much it's funny.  I can just see DiCaprio whining to Mr. Scorcese about how 'Bill gets more screen time than me!''Gangs of New York' is a great drama to say the least, 8/10.",Null,0,0,29 July 2003
True Romance," Not a chick flick, but if it was, I'd still like it!
","Great movie!  I loved it so much!  The acting from everyone was brilliant, the action was great, and I even liked the background music!  The star cameos were great, and even though they were short, they acted their parts very well.All of that aside, I have to say, the best parts of this movie were Gary Oldman as a wannabe-black pimp and Christopher Walken as 'The Antichrist'. Both played their roles scarily and humorous.  I loved it.9 out of 10!",9,0,1,8 June 2003
Gladiator," Amazing, epic adventure with great performances and fight sequences alike
","Russel Crowe won his first Oscar for playing gladiator Maximus, a Roman soldier betrayed by the emperor's son Commodus (Jaquin Phoenix).  Maximus is forced to become a gladiator, fighting and slowly gaining the respect of the Roman public.  Crowe's performance defines drama, as the heavily reluctant and equally mourning Maximus.  Phoenix almost matches Crowe's brilliance, but over-acts a little in some scenes, losing a possible Oscar win.Aside from the fabulous acting there is also the perfectly choreographed sword battles.  From the beginning raid on the barbarians to the climactic Crowe vs. Phoenix fight scene, the battles,  and everything else in 'Gladiator' for that matter, never disappoint.8.5/10",Null,0,1,3 July 2003
Dodgeball," I have never laughed so hard in a movie theater before!
","Spoofs are what started stupid humor, back in the seventies.  But as time went on, spoofs started sucking themselves, and the Dumb Movie was created. The Dumb Movie is the type of film that has loads of stupid spoof-like humor, but isn't spoofing anything in particular.  Most of the time the Dumb Movie is awful, but rarely it is effective, fun and very, very funny. `Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story' is one of those times.The plot is basically unimportant, as the film is mostly an episodic collection of slapstick humor, but I'll explain it anyway.  Peter La Fleur (Vince Vaughan) owns a workout gym called `Average Joe's', which has a very small number of members, all of which are burned out losers.  None of the members have paid a membership fee in quite a while, and soon lawyer Catherine Veach (Christine Taylor) is telling La Fleur that if he doesn't pay fifty thousand dollars in thirty days, the gym will be transformed into a parking lot for the much larger Globo Gym across the street, run by White Goodman (Ben Stiller).La Fleur and the rest of the losers decide to enter a dodgeball tournament in Las Vegas, the prize money conveniently being fifty thousand dollars.  Of course, there's one thing wrong: they all suck at playing dodgeball.  Seeing them lose against a team of girl scouts inspires legendary player Patches O'Houlihan (Rip Torn) who's in his eighties and confined to a motorized wheelchair to round them up and teach them how to play.I can't think of any other actor that could play O'Houlihan than Rip Torn. He plays it on just the right level of Over-the-Top, you know no one like this could ever exist, but he's still somehow believable.  It must be his booming, raspy voice and his angry facial expressions.  He's definitely one of the funniest aspects of the film.The rest of the cast is good too.  Vaughan plays his character straight: he's unenthusiastic, pessimistic, and lazy but still a nice guy and he makes a good hero for the film.  The rest of the losers  including a middle aged nerd (Stephen Root), a very unconfident high schooler (Justin Long) and a guy who thinks he's a pirate (Alan Tudyk)  are all played well, they're not too crazily over the top to be unbelievable.  The only actually bad performance comes from Christine Taylor, who is mostly unnecessary and rarely funny.The film's best performance comes from Ben Stiller as White Goodman, a man so insecure he pumps up his muscles (and an inflatable crotch too), tortures himself if he even thinks about eating junk food and surrounds himself with huge muscle-bound guys to look even tougher.  He doesn't realize he's insecure, though.  Instead he thinks he's confident, always trying to sound smart but only succeeding in contradicting himself over and over again.  The performance is flawless; it's one of 2004's best so far.  If ever there were a spoof performance that was worthy of an Oscar, this would be it.Though the film is driven by its over the top characters it's not only them that's funny.  The dodgeball matches are gut-wrenching hilarity too, for some reason you manage to laugh every single time someone gets hit with something.  It never gets old.As for the plot and depth of the characters, well, this is a Dumb Film, that's not important.  Director Thurber knew this, and didn't bother much with those details.  He knows the plot is bad though, as is made clear when the huge trunk of money La Fleur's team win at the end is labeled in big yellow letters `Deus ex Machina', invoking laughter from the more intellectual types in the audience.This is the best form of pure, dumb summer fun, a recommendation to all, 7/10.",Null,0,0,21 June 2004
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The Coen's epic, dreamlike adventure...
","...'O Brother, Where Art Thou?''s title is reason enough to like this film. It is amazingly well done, one of the Coen's best, and the whole tone of the film - from the music to the shade of screen - is so dreamlike and creative that its hard not to like it.  It's funny, smart, sad, tense, tragic, dreamy and cool, all in one.The story focuses on the adventures of three escaped convicts (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) on their way to find treasure in depression-era South U.S.A.  On their way they meet loads of colorful characters and even have a run-in with the Klu Klex Klan...and worse.I have to say, the most remarkable thing about this movie is Clooney's performance.  I didn't think the guy had it in him, but he manages to pull his accented and bumblingly intelligent character well.  This definitely ranks up with 'Ocean's Eleven' and 'Out of Sight' for movies showing that yes, George can act.The Coen's screenplay is also worth mentioning.  Ever since 'Miller's Crossing' you'd expect a Coen movie to be filled with much smart, witty and entertaining dialogue.  You get what you expect.  'Witty' is an understatement for every word that exits every character's mouth.For those of you looking for good Coen, I recommend this...and anything else, really, 8.5/10.",Null,0,1,19 November 2003
The Godfather," VERY good, but not the best...
","...'The Godfather', as everyone knows, is a classic.  It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties.  It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny.  Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it.  He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom.  Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.'The Godfather' is the template for good drama.  Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best.  In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre.  'The Godfather' is the best crime drama.  'Casablanca' is the best romance.  'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars' movies are the best adventures.  All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics.  Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining.  Films like 'The Godfather', 'Casablanca', 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars' are the reason movies are so popular.Enjoy, 9/10.",10,22,46,14 August 2003
