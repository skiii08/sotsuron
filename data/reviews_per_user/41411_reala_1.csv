The Blair Witch Project," Worth seeing.
","I'm not sure what the source of all the 'this is the scariest movie ever made' hype is, but it's a film worth seeing.  The handheld shots are effective at sucking the viewer into the trio's nightmare, and the low production quality actually works in the film's favor on many occasions. The actors do a very good job progressing from film school students to terrified kids who just want to crawl back into the womb.However, the characters seem unbelievably stupid at times (similar to most films within the genre), and the fact that there always is at least one camera rolling, day or night, whenever something scary happens is a bit hard to swallow.  The ending, which I won't ruin here, would have been much more affecting for me if the fact that throughout the scene, the characters never took their eyes from the viewfinders on their video cameras hadn't seemed so ludicrous.Still, it's a no-budget classic and a lot of people are going to be way more freaked out than I was.  If you get motion sick easily, think twice before going -- the ENTIRE movie is shot handheld, and much of this is while the characters are running, screaming, falling, etc.",1,0,3,21 July 1999
