Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," incredibly primitive
","I 100% agree with Brinduc who wrote: 'I am Romanian and due to the totalitarian regime I was part of for all my childhood and youth, I learned to enjoy real situational comedy that was making fun of the regime and society of the time. That was apparently in your face, raw humor, but rather subtle and genuine that could make you laugh and cry at the same time.This movie does not deserve to be called racist or offensive or comic or smart or anything. It attempts in a very childish way to extract some laughs, that's all. Any 7 year old can make fun of people this way.I cannot comprehend why the North American public likes this low and childish humor, other than to think that most regular citizen born on this continent live within some boundaries and clich√©s that make them narrow minded. Perhaps the people in this society that collectively attributed such a high rating to this movie have not been exposed enough to hardship and tragedy in order to be able to use real humor to laugh at itself other than using gross jokes.I was upset, angry and frustrated after seeing this movie and I profoundly regret every penny I spent on the ticket and if there was any way to recover them I would be first in line. Don't be the next one, please.' I was born and raised in Prague. Maybe that's why I sense this the same way as Brinduc. I found this movie incredibly primitive. Primitive 'humor' for primitive people. The movie has a big success in USA. I can just wonder why....",1,12,25,20 May 2007
Hostel," Worst movie I've seen
","I went to write down own review, but I have found comment of user named Tomas. It fits so well to my opinion that I will just quote him: 'My English is not very good (and i'm sorry for that), but this ''movie''is one of the stupidest I ever seen! Low budget movie with stupid, simple and awful story about 3 guys going to Bratislava (capital of Slovakia) to have some fun with slovak horny girls and they get killed by unearthly brutal people of small country Slovakia. This movie shows Slovakia like some kind of backward, poor and dirty country. If you know Slovakia, you know that this movie was filming in Czech Republic(there is a lot of signs with czech language on it, also the language they speak is czech), which is lovely country with beautiful history. You can see kids robbing these guys on the street by daylight!?What is that? This is not Kosovo, Afganistan or Iraq. They are not in the war or something. You should check some websites about this. Everybody who knows something about Eastern Europe, and saw this movie, know that this is degradation of this two countries and the producer Eli Roth is moron!!! It is a shame, that they earn money on this lame, full of lies rude stupidity!' I agree 100%. I would just like to add that Tarantino is recording Hostel. I'm really shocked.",1,1,2,19 January 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Is it really possible to hate for language?
","I watched the movie and I found it very moving. Yes, naivety is the keyword, but that's how children are - and they are surely not to be blamed for that. Movie might be shocking, but I found even more shocking some comments written here. Someone wrote that movie failed, because it was difficult for him to hate those Nazis as they were speaking perfect English instead of German. Ouch! How stupid can people be? Are there any limits for that? I am Czech from Prague and my country suffered a lot during war, but does it give me right to hate Germans for language they are speaking? Hell no! And I know for fact that not all Germans were supporting their government during the war. Be fair in your statements, guys!",9,1,2,6 April 2009
