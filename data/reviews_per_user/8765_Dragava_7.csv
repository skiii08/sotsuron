Casablanca," Play it Again. Play it Forever.
",It doesn't really get better than this. Best screenplay ever penned. Best Best Picture winner of all-time. A masterpiece.,10,2,2,23 October 2019
Suicide Squad," Stock up on Advil.
","The brief enjoyment I received from my viewing of 'Suicide Squad' did not come from the film itself. During the skull-splitting climax a character delivers a line so awful, that my cinema actually began to collectively cackle at the tragedy of it. Yes. We were all laughing at just how bad this flick was. Banal, bloated and as boisterous as a sugar-fuelled child, you'll feel your eyes pulling from your head mere minutes in. The damnable squandering of first-class songs is a mere bullet point on the list of frustrating choices made in this production. Characters' motivations are as shallow as a paddling pool and just as we sense we may soon migrate to the deep end the jackhammer editing dunks you on your head. This script, as it is, seems to have been scraped out in only weeks, perhaps in a dim room whilst two sheets to the wind. The talented cast have near-naught to work with. It's difficult to say that David Ayer (director and writer) acted alone, and although he's produced accomplished work in the past, one hopes this franchise and these characters are warranted more time and creativity in cinema to come.",2,1,2,26 October 2019
Forrest Gump," Wood for the Trees.
","His name is quite clever and the writing often is too. On occasion Eric Roth will become embroiled in the wryly cognizant nature of the story, but both Zemeckis and Hanks reveal such heart that cannot be ignored.",8,2,2,23 October 2019
Dunkirk," He's Coming Back Round...
","Will Nolan ever let up? There was a time when the man was shooting on weekends with friends to produce something on a shoe-string budget to an unknown audience. His audience is now known as one of the widest, well-entertained yet not empty-headed and far from emotionally absent folk. And Dunkirk will meet all their expectations I'm sure. From the get-go we are presented with a three-sided structure to Nolan's war story - land, sea, air. Men on the beaches dive into the sand for cover whenever an enemy spitfire is heard overheard. We hear it just as clearly. The sound in this film is overwhelmingly phenomenal. Surely the best of the year. It doesn't let up when we cut to the air battle, swirling and tumbling planes guiding us through the open skies - all perfectly shot. Zimmer's score simply adds to the flavour, soaring as spectacularly as the spitfires themselves. In short, go see the film, you won't be disappointed. I saw it on a pretty big screen and you should do the same. It's a spectacle that must be experienced. I saw Baby Driver last week and this far surpasses that. Brilliantly edited, shot, and over it all, directed. If Chris Nolan doesn't at last get the nomination he's deserved for years at the Oscars it will be yet another criminal injustice committed by those fools.",7,1,14,19 July 2017
Spirited Away," A Hot Drink on a Cold Night.
","Spirited away is what you'll be if you let yourself. It's a near-masterpiece. The animation alone is an achievement. Rich and fantastical and lively; it never lets up. The story is sweet enough for children and revelatory to the right degree for adults. Like a far off land you might only glimpse at with each scene you want to know more, feel more. A freeing film. Watch it.",9,0,0,22 October 2019
Sicario," Denis, Deakins, Blunt, Benicio, Brolin.
","And each reigns in their own way. One of the few thrillers in recent memory that does not drag, does not quiver, and firmly pulls the trigger only when needed. Blunt turns out one of the best performances of her eclectic career, with her go-getting, no-nonsense, (and frankly, blunt) character who ends up near-buried under the enmity of the Mexican drug war. Denis Villeneuve does not shy from showing the seemingly sempiternal rough edges of this world, highlighted exquisitely by a tracking shot through the Ju√°rez slums, and a following scene at the border crossing which rivals the tension in the opening of 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'No Country for Old Men''s coin toss. Deakins produces the best shots of the year, and Del Toro's frightening Alejandro steals the scene on several occasions. Much praise has to be placed on the writer, Taylor Sheridan, as scripting something original that is both taut and question-raising is certainly little seen nowadays. An excellent film.",8,0,0,23 October 2019
The Godfather," Unrefusable
","Akin to the world's finest wines, 'The Godfather' deepens in vitality with each passing year in cinema.",9,1,2,2 November 2019
