Minority Report," Spectacular. #1 film of 2002.
","May contain SPOILERSThis film is a brilliant sci-fi neo-noir, set in a futuristic Washington DC in which the Pre-crime initiative has eliminated murder within the city.The effects are simply stunning, and the film succeds on all levels. Colin Farrell provides the films best performance, though Tom Cruise is solid enough. The remainder of the cast play their roles competently, though not brilliantly, but the film is so compelling that this is rendered immaterial.I love classical music, so the parts of the film in which a future murderer is identified, where classical music is used, I found outstanding.I've seen this film twice now, and none of the impact was lost upon my second viewing.Among my favourite films of all time. 10/10",Null,0,0,28 April 2003
The Usual Suspects," Great movie, great twist
","May contain SPOILERS.I've only just seen this film and I was blown away by its ending. The story revolves around the questioning of 'Verbal' Kint, (Kevin Spacey), who is interrogated by police in California to help with a mysterious occurrence on board a boat in port, where a vicious bloodbath had taken place. The key is the identification of one Kaiser Sosay, (I don't know if I spelt it right), who is apparently the orchestrator of these events. I won't reveal the ending, though it is amazing, see for yourself.The story is gripping, and there are fine performances by Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro among others. As ever Spacey shines with considerable charisma. Also good is Pete Postlethwaite, (albeit speaking in an unusual accent), though his screen time is limited.Overall this is a stunning crime thriller, which fans of films such as 'LA Confidential' would certainly enjoy. I promise you, you'll love the ending.10/10",Null,0,1,28 April 2003
Quantum of Solace," Really liked it
","I never let other peoples' views influence me before I see a film, and this was no exception. But after the first few minutes I thought I might have been wrong. The opening sequence was frankly annoying with excessive editing and that shaky camera, and as for the song, (and I hadn't heard it before), well I never thought I'd say this but it makes Madonna's Die Another Day sound good.But when the film started for real, all that was soon forgiven. The action was breathtaking, the story was good and the rough edge to Bond's character was retained, Craig's Bond being the most human so far. I'm not ashamed to say that I was touched when he held the dying Mathis to his chest. He's also an irresponsible and dangerous Bond, a side which the character needed. The main villain was a little weak, but that was balanced out by a Bond girl who was as strong and as motivated as Bond without trying to surpass him as we saw with Jinx in DAD.Judy Dench was great again, and I liked the portrayal of Leiter too. I hope that he and Bond will soon be friends as before. Interesting too, was a moment that I took as a homage to Goldfinger, though I won't reveal it here. And there were of course some good locations some glamorous, some not; a good balance. Curiously, they brought back the traditional gun barrel sequence though not until the end of the film.Hold back your opinions until the end.",9,3,6,10 November 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," This is my favourite ever film
","May contain SPOILERSI love this film, even though the book is better. Truly deserving of the oscars that it won, and probably more.Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster make a winning combination that is simply irresistable. The atmospheric scenes are wonderful; Hopkins' stunning and chilling performance is truly unforgettable. It appeared to unnerve Foster with fantastic results. She is totally convincing as the FBI trainee, and her scenes with Hopkins are among the best film scenes ever. Good supporting performances are provided by Scott Glen and Ted Levine, the later as a despicable transexual serial killer, shows skill in his limited screen time.The scene in which Hannibal Lecter escapes his prison cell is superbly directed, and the result - the famous face removing incident, and the subsequent positioning of one of the bodies are fantastic.Hopkins performance is such that I felt glad as he escaped, and walked free at the end.'I'd love to talk but I'm having an old friend for dinner.'This classic quote could be quite disturbing - until you see who the intended victim is.Overall a quite brilliant film expertly adapted from a quite brilliant book. 10/10",10,1,1,10 April 2003
