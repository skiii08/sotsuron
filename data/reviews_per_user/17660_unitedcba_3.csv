Jackson,Gwyneth Paltrow 142 min - Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi | Superhero Suitable: PG-13VEpic movie!!!! I don't know from where to start...I mean this movie is the mother of all the entertainment which you can ever ask for! A movie which has produced what it was promised when it was under the production. 143 minutes of breathtaking experience and definitely a movie like this can be produced once in a life time. I don't know when was the last time I saw a movie in 3D but I am glad my experience of watching this movie will live for a long time. Lots of memories are now related to this movie! Excellent direction, I mean handling all these superheros, boy, that takes a great talent! However, in my personal opinion Hulk was the best then Iron Man! Special effects not to mention was top class..3D effects were also superb BUT try to watch without 3D!!! Excellent editing, great script and brilliant dialogues specially the punch lines. I can go on writing about this movie because its just 'AWESOME'. My final verdict 'DONT MISS THIS ONE' !!!STORYLINENick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. brings together a team of super humans to form The Avengers to help save the Earth from Loki and his army.Can find @ 'GO AND WATCH IN ANY CINEMA NEAR YOU'More reviews @ https://www.facebook.com/unitedcbaMR Copyright ©2012 ~unitedcba.

21 Jump Street," A very good entertaining movie...
","21 Jump Street (2012) ~umR ☛ 6.5/10 Directors: Phil Lord, Chris Miller Stars: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube 109 min - Action | Comedy Suitable: 15LVA very good entertaining movie...21 Jump Street is a big screen adaptation of 80s TV serial. I haven't seen this serial but I had a great time watching this movie. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it's nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com. Johah Hill, like always brings his trademark comedy in this movie too the only difference is looks thin! While saying that there are numerous time the jokes fall flat however,what really important is this movie keeps you entertained till the end and i guess that what matters..Overall, anyone who love to watch a fun-action-comedy movie or say 'usual Hollywood style' Action-Comedy then this is it! 109 minutes of complete entertainment! STORYLINE In high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was a dork and Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the popular jock. After graduation, both of them joined the police force and ended up as partners riding bicycles in the city park. Since they are young and look like high school students, they are assigned to an undercover unit to infiltrate a drug ring that is supplying high school students synthetic drugs.My Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/unitedcbaMRCopyright ©2012 ~unitedcba.

The Departed," Cracking movie.......
","The Departed (2006) | My Rating ☛ 7.5/10 151 min - Crime | Mystery | Thriller First of all I shouldn't have watched Infernal Affairs..coz..I was able to predict everything that was going to happen. Now the question is which one is better? Well, both movies were just awesome however i liked Infernal Affairs little bit then Departed. May b I saw it first. But hats off to these four guys; Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg and Jack Nicholson. It was fun to watch Mark Wahlberg he was angry throughout the movie and the dialogues were awesome. All in all a superb movie!!!",Null,0,0,18 July 2011
