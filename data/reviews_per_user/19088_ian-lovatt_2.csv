Ford v Ferrari," I don't do cars ... this is stunning!
","Cards on the table - I'm a massive Damon and Bale fan so that's what caught my eye. I'm not that driven by cars ... sorry!I love this film. The acting is great, the storyline epic and the production is excellent. I love the mix of the moody soundtrack, slowed pace and great soundtrack.It is thrilling from the off and the pace never drops.Cannot recommend this highly enough.",10,0,0,15 May 2020
Green Book," Just superb on every level
","Felt compelled to write this.Besides the superb acting, the script is very witty, the scenery beautifully juxtopositioned against the darkness of society and the intertwining story lines are as complex as you want to make them.How friendships develop ... the breaking down of barriers ... not judging books by their covers ... being true to yourself ... commitment ... moral high ground ... take your pick!If you watch no other film ... watch this.",10,0,2,7 October 2019
