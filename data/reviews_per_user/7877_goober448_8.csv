3:10 to Yuma," An Above Average Western
","Disclaimer: I have not seen the original 3:10 to Yuma.Once upon a time I enjoyed a good western. It's been a long time coming, but 3:10 to Yuma is a classic yet modern western with all the goodies. The story may not be the best scripted, but the acting, cinematography, the score, the directing, and the action are above average. Most enjoyable are the characters portrayed by Russell Crowe (Ben Wade) and Ben Foster (Charlie Prince). Wade and Prince are the 'bad' guys. Crowe and Foster shine in these roles. The hero is an odd character, but Bale portrays him perfectly for the script. The supporting cast add to the movie and do not distract. Watching this on Blu-Ray, I must say the surround sound was awesome. Overall, this may not be a must see movie, but if you ever enjoyed a good western, this one should sit well with you.",9,1,3,13 April 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Catch POTC III on DVD... Your body will thank you.....
","Where does one begin in describing this film? With Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, one had to leave the theater feeling they had been entertained. Now, other than the lovable Captain Jack, what else warranted 7 out of 10 stars? (Actually, 7 out of 10 is probably being very generous.) POTC III has beautiful scenery and a tremendous amount of CGI special effects. Little Jack, the monkey is such a scene stealer. You have to love the monkey! The appearance of Keith Richards as Sparrow's father was long anticipated, and though his screen time was short, it was good. I enjoyed Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa in POTC I & was pleased to see him once again in POTC III. The ending leaves you with the feeling that if so inclined, there might be future POTC films. I couldn't rate this film higher than 7 out 10 stars because it is much too lengthy, the plot is sometimes beyond comprehension, the scenes sometimes much too frantic and the fight scene marriage ridiculous. Everyone knows Elizabeth & Will are in love, but being married aboard ship while in the midst of a battle? Please..... If you don't feel the need to rush out to the theater, I'd wait for the DVD on this one. At least you won't be sitting for 2 hours and 48 minutes without a break. Also, if you're a Johnny Depp and/or POTC fan, you won't want to miss it.",7,0,2,27 May 2007
The Number 23," The Number 23 Left Hanging...
","The Number 23 has masterpiece written all over it. Anyone who has ever had a fascination with numerology or been a student of numerology could have written a better script. This film falls way short in delivering as a psychological thriller. Schumacher, Carrey and Madsen are not at fault. The direction and acting, though not stellar, are above average. The beginning of the script is good. It draws you in and holds your interest. Schumacher uses camera angles and coloring well during the narratives read from the book. The scenes allowing the viewer to see what the character is reading are the brilliant spots in this film. Once the character's obsession with the number 23 begins, the script starts unraveling. The number 23 is just left dangling. Repeatedly seeing, saying and writing the number 23 becomes boring. Character development becomes shoddy, the plot becomes Hollywood predictable and the twists and turns though existing, do not thrill. Still I can't rate the film lower than 6 stars because Carrey and Madsen worked diligently with what they were handed. Fernley Phillips needs to attend script writing 101.",6,0,2,28 July 2007
Transformers," Summer Blockbuster that gets it right.....
","Marvelous! Michael Bay and the entire special effects team - I am awed by Transformers. The CGI/special effects of this film are unsurpassed by a film of today. Kudos for a job well done! For starters, I have never watched the TV show, so I cannot compare the movie to what came before it. I just know a great movie when I see one, and this one is unequaled. The plot is respectable, the actors fit the parts, the film is fast paced, filled with action, and the humor is supreme.... I could go on and on, but if you want to be completely entertained, go to the theater now and see this film.There's only one thing not to love about this movie- the bad guys. LOL Who wants to love them anyway? We love to hate them, and this is exactly how you'll feel.Did I mention the special effects? Seriously, you will be blown away. I could have gone back into the theater and re-watched this film once again today just to see the special effects.I simply must own this on DVD. What's the release date? : )",10,4,6,6 July 2007
Children of Men," A Chaotic World Portrayed Beautifully
","A poignant masterpiece on a world gone mad with globalization who's timing could not have been better. This film hooked me from the start and kept me enthralled until the end. It left me wanting more. Great loose adaptation of the P D James novel. Clive Owen was amazingly brilliant and along with stellar performances by the supporting cast, this film takes the viewer along for a meaningful look at what our world could easily become. From script, acting, directing, location, and cinematography, this film will not leave you bored, but leave you wanting to know more about the future of mankind. Michael Caine captures the essence of 'an old hippie' with such heart, he's easily the most lovable character of this film. I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys intrigue, action combined with heart and humanity. The DVD version contains some terrific philosophical content on world globalization which is enlightening and frightening.",7,1,4,5 May 2007
Blood Diamond," Worth Watching But Too Political
","An excellent storyline, but the political slant combined with 'Hollywoodism', keeps this movie from being a 10 star film. Hollywood should take notice that a longer run time doesn't mean a better film. This movie could have and should have been shortened. Even with the storyline and fast action scenes, the film still drags in places. DiCaprio and Hounsou are indeed the diamonds in this film. Brilliant talent shining brightly throughout the film is what will hold your interest. The accents were a bit difficult to follow in places, but not enough to cloud the understanding of the scenes. The storyline serves up political intrigue, brutal violence, child exploitation, shoot outs/explosions, car chases, greed, and even love. There are a few shots of breathtaking beautiful mountain scenery. Overall, a film worth watching, but it is a bit too long and a bit too political.",7,0,1,5 July 2007
There Will Be Blood," A Cinematic Masterpiece
","A film unlike any other in 2007.... Paul Thomas Anderson delivers a knockout punch with There Will Be Blood! The cinematography, writing, scripting, directing, scoring and acting blend the story of a lust for power into a cinematic masterpiece. Daniel Day Lewis has no rivals. He is the ultimate actor. The supporting cast proves they can hold the screen with DDL, even if he does steal every scene in which he appears. The beginning of the film offers such a different feel than most films shot today. It's quite refreshing. A film everyone should see, just to say they've seen it. Even if you end up hating it. (Seems the reviews are split on this one.) When 'There Will Be Blood' releases on Blu-Ray, it will become a centerpiece in my collection.",10,4,8,13 April 2008
1408," Just didn't work for me....
","A Stephen King short about an evil room made into a film starring John Cusack just has spine chilling thriller written all over it. Just viewing the trailer I felt the chill bumps start rising. I had to go and spoil those wonderful chill bumps. I saw the movie- chill bumps only once & jumped in my seat only twice. During the entire 1 hour and 34 minutes of this film, only one person in the theater made a sound similar to a scream. What went wrong with this film? The story is evident and John Cusack brings it all to the table. Mikael Håfstrom didn't deliver the goods. This is only the second film I've viewed which Mikael Håfstrom has directed. The first was Derailed. Could someone please ask the film companies to cut this man from their list? His direction destroys what should be really good films. The plot in this film is one that should be so intense you grip the edge of your seat the entire film. The direction instead turns out a want to be psychological thriller. I have to give 4 stars for the story and Cusack. Cusack gave 110% trying to make this film work. It saddens me that it didn't. King and Cusack fans will want to see this film. If you're looking for what the trailer promised, don't bother......",4,1,2,6 July 2007
