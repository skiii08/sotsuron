",The only interesting parts of the movie were put into the trailer. The other 2 hours were complete nonsense. It was disturbing and not scary. I have to say there was great acting but besides that the plot was very uninteresting. Waste of 2 hours. Wouldn't recommend watching. I thought Winchester was a bad movie until I saw this.,1,10,23,15 June 2018

","I love going back and watching this movie. I guess everyone has different taste but what creeps me out about this movie is the music and compared to crap that's been coming out recently, it's pretty good.I think the whole idea of dreams is interesting because you don't know what goes on when your asleep and I love the idea. I watched this movie the first time in 9th grade I believe. It was in our classroom and we turned the lights off and it was awesome feeling. You know I just realized what makes things scarier...when people around you are scared. When people around you are screaming and hugging each other it puts more of a fear into you or (me). But when people around me are chill and quiet, it rubs off. It's fun to be scared together even if its just pretend...it sets the atmosphere. Idk i guess I like it because it brings back good vibes. I'm sure everyone can relate.",8,0,0,8 September 2018
