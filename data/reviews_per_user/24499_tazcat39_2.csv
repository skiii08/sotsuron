Minority Report," A super entertaining movie
","I knew I would like this movie when I discovered that it is based on a short story by Philip A. Dick, who also wrote the story Bladerunner was based on, and Bladerunner is one of my all time favorites.
I gave this movie a ten.  Tom Cruise was very good as the precrime cop who gets in the 'system' himself for a supposedly future murder.  Although I guessed some of the plot ahead of time (maybe I TOO am a precog!!), it did not take away from my enjoyment.  I thought the special effects were fantastic.  And I don't analyze the movies I like to death like some do; I just enjoy them.  Although I waited to see it on video, I really wish I could have seen it in the theater.",10,2,4,2 February 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," This is the only martial arts movie I have ever liked
","Watching this lyrical movie was simply awesome to this senior citizen who usually cannot stand martial arts movies.  The fight sequences, the 'flying' over rooftops, the 'walking' up walls and the treetop sequence were thrilling to me.  It was beautifully shot and a good story, fairy tale or not.  I was raised on fairy tales here in the USA.  It was a tremendous experience to view one from another country.I wish I knew the ages of some of the naysayers.  To say this movie is 'boring' or, in today's tacky vernacular, 'sucked' makes me wonder what such people like in their films. This movie has  special effects and action that far surpasses much of the pap that is churned out of Hollywood today.",10,2,3,3 August 2002
