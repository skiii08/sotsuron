Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Probably the best of the prequels
","I really don't like the fact that some people don't like Anakin as a small boy.For my part, I thought it was a good idea. Much better that making him evil all at once; we had to see Anakin before he was evil, back to when he was as innocent as you or me as a newborn.9-year-old Jake Lloyd did a great job as young Anakin, and the pod race was fantastic.**Spoilers ahead**I also don't like it that they killed off Qui-Gon so quickly. He was a good character; they at least could have shown his 'spirit' in the second or third episode.Overall, I'd say this is probably the best of the prequels. I don't hate this movie, but I don't love it either.",7,0,1,1 March 2006
The Sound of Music," The best musical ever made
","Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer star in this classic musical. Andrews plays a woman who wants to be a nun, but circumstances lead her to be a governess of a widower, Captain von Trapp (Plummer) and his seven children. The young children are very cute, but it's Andrew's performance that really got my attention. (Why didn't she get a Best Actress Award???????) Capt. von Trapp is a very stern man, and will not allow his children to have any fun of any kind. That is, until Maria shows up. They eventually fall in love, get married, and you just have to watch it again and again to really enjoy it. It's nearly three hours long, but it's worth every minute. I don't see how anyone with a brain could not like this movie. Watch it! You WON'T regret it!",10,2,8,24 February 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Great action!
","This is one of my all-time favorite movies! It's not currently on my Top 30 list, but it's pretty darn close. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, a science teacher who goes exploring for ancient artifacts in different parts of the world.**Spoilers** After failing to retrieve an ancient idol, he goes to Nepal to retrieve an important piece that will help him stop the Nazi's from getting the Lost Ark, an artifact that the Israelites had hidden in a big underground room.I won't give away any more spoilers, in case there's someone out there who likes to read spoilers. I'll just say one more thing: It's a great movie, but children age 8 and under should not be allowed to watch this movie; they may have nightmares about it for months afterward.My Score: 8/10.",8,0,0,24 March 2006
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Not bad
","I really don't like Roger Rabbit that much, he's can be really annoying at times. But this was a rare occurrence when I enjoyed a movie with him in it. Christopher Lloyd is great as Baron von Rotton, a.k.a., 'Judge Doom'. A toon who's disguised as a man. He wants to find a way to kill the toons. But toons can't be killed. Or can they? he invents 'The Dip' that can actually kill a tune, and demonstrates on a toon shoe.It's up to Roger and a non-toon friend, Eddie Valiant, who's brother was murdered by Judge Doom several years before, to stop JHudge Doom from destroying Toon Town with his Dip.It could have been better, but nobody's perfect.6/10.",6,1,5,23 March 2006
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," Super Duper
","This is a great movie, and I think we should applaud Disney for their efforts.Few movies have been made that are better than this one. I actually haven't seen it more months, but it's a great movie.Creulella De Vil is an evil old lady who wants some puppies to make them into fur coats. In the middle of one night, the puppies are stolen by De Vil's two assistants: Horrace and Jasper. Both men are stupid, but they'll do anything to get cash.With the help of St. Tibs, a cat, and a Colonel, a dog, the parents of the fifteen puppies, Pongo and Perdita find the puppies, and they find their way home, being chased by Cruella and the two men.This is a great film, and I recommend it for all ages.My Score: 8/10.",8,3,3,27 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Great music and acting
","Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the greatest movies of all time! Johnny Depp gives his best performance in this humorous movie that was inspired by a Disneyland ride, though I didn't really see anything in common, except perhaps the treasure and 'dead men tell no tails' bit. *** Spoilers ahead***Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings trilogy) plays William Turner, a blacksmith/ future pirate. Although he says he never will be a pirate, he does some things that prove he is a good pirate. WARNING! There are a few words that I would classify as bad, but you can mute the words if you know where to look. I own the soundtrack to this movie; I highly recommend it for those who love music.",10,1,4,23 February 2006
Beauty and the Beast," Ugh!
","I have hardly seen a movie that is worth seeing less than this movie. And I'm usually a die-hard fan of G-rated movies. This movie is, by all means, appropriate for children, the kind that is nearly non-existent today, but it is still not worth seeing to a guy like me. I really don't like the songs that much, though Page O'Hara, the voice of Belle, did an exceptional job. Need I say anything about Robby Benson? He did great as the beast, and later when he was turned back into a human, as the prince.Other than the weird songs, it was OKay, but don't watch this movie unless you can put up with a 6-year old (daughter/sister) singing her head off.My Score: 3/20.",3,6,40,15 March 2006
Finding Nemo," Finding Nemo: A great classic film!
","I loved Finding Nemo from the very beginning. The young voices are cute, especially Nemo and Squirt. 'Finding Nemo' is a fun-loving, wonderfully animated movie that won the Best Animated Film of 2003. **Spoilers ahead** Nemo is a young clown fish, who's father, Marlin is overprotective of him. He has a good reason, to be overprotective, though. Not long before Nemo was born, his wife, Coral and most of their children, still in their eggs, were swiped by a mean-looking barracuda. Later, Nemo meets Gill, Peach, and the rest the of the 'Tank Gang.' Marlin eventually finds Nemo, but never would have if not for the help of Dory, who suffers from short-term memory loss. She helps him, and she refers to Nemo by several names: Harpo, (Marx) Elmo, (Sesame Street character) and others. 'Finding Nemo' is #2 on my all-time favorite movie list, second only to 'It's a Wonderful Life' Watch 'Finding Nemo' and you won't regret it!",10,1,3,23 February 2006
Chicken Run," A great film
","'Chicken Run' is a great film, but it has i's weaknesses. The 'clay animation, for example, is a bit faulty. The story is great, and the voice actors/actresses put a great performance on, especially Mel Gibson, who is really the only actor of the lot that I'm familiar with. **Minor spoiler ahead** Gibson plays Rocky, a cocky American rooster who wants freedom from the circus, and crash-lands into a chicken farm,complete with 50 or so chickens. Plus, a British cock who talks likehe's still in the Army. The chickens are basically tortured into laying eggs by the Tweety's, who's farm is going downhill. Mrs. Tweety gets equipment to turn 'those stupid creatures' into pies. Mr. Tweety is incredibly stupid, bu ends up being the smarter one of the two. Ginger is the leader of the chickens, and she helps the chickens fly for freedom. 'Chicken Run' is a classic example of a fun movie. I would recommend it for people who love good comedy. My Score: 8/10.",8,0,0,24 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Star Wars Episode 6 - The final film of the great saga
","Many weeks ago, I had this film listed on my Top 30 at #6. Now, for some reason unknown even to me, it has fallen to the bottom 10. Now it is #24.The acting was great. The story was great. But it was not directed by George Lucas, and that is not great. Mark Hamill, and only Mark Hamill, could have played the part of Luke Skywalker.***Spoilers ahead***Overall, this movie was done pretty well. It lost a point due to the fact that it had no real central plot. Unless you count the Rebels destroying the Death Star, and Darth Vader betraying the Emperor (finally) and destroying him in the process.While done well, it could definitely been a lot better.My Score: 8/10.",9,1,2,27 February 2006
Elf," The worst movie I have ever seen
","I have never seen a worse movie than 'Elf.' I put this movie as the worse movie of all time, and this is just for movies that I have seen. I don't think it would be fair to compare it to a movie that I haven't seen, like 'Brokenback Mountain.' ***Spoilers***'Elf' starts out with Will Ferril as Buddy, a human found as a baby by the elves. He is brought up by a 'papa elf', whatever that means. He later learns about his biological father and sets out to find him. His father isn't all that excited at first of Buddy coming to him, but his half brother seems . . . weird. There is NOTHING in this movie that is worth seeing. The so-called humor is very weak, and the story is very lame. For Christmas movies, I recommend 'It's a Wonderful Life.' At least that movie has a good actor.",1,10,34,24 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Worst of all Star Wars films, story wise
","The action is good, the acting is somewhat good, but the story? Blech.I hate the fact that Padme and Anakin fall in love. She's at least 8 years older than him. That's not right.The dual between Yoda and Count Dooku is just about all that makes this film worth watching at all. If they'd made it a bit longer, the dual, that is, this film would have received at least a 7 from me.***Spoilers*** The fight in the Colliseum place was pretty cool, and the skill of Anakin with a light saber was really good.I thought it was interesting that Obi-Wan at one point tells Anakin: 'Why do I feel like you're going to be the death of me?' Anakin answers, 'Don't say that, Master.' It turns out that Anakin was the death of Obi-Wan, years later after Anakin had joined the Dark Side. (Watch Episode 4) This was my least-favorite Star Wars film story-wise. Don't watch it, unless you're a die-hard Star Wars fan.My Score: 5/10",5,0,2,1 March 2006
"Monsters, Inc."," Monster's the 2nd-best Pixar film
","I really loved Monster's, Inc. I first watched the film while on vacation with my family in Utah, back in the summer of 2001. I really didn't like the end that much at first, but then it began to blossom and multiply, if you know what I mean. It eventually found its way into my Top Ten and it has stayed there ever since, not moving much at all. No one but John Goodman and Billy Crystal could have done the voices of Sully and Mike, and James Coburn was excellent as Mr. Waternoose. **Possible spoiler ahead** One main character, known as 'Boo' is the only human character in the movie. She is maybe 2 years old, I'm not really sure. But she is really cute. SHe can't talk very well, being so young, and the movie makers had a hard time with Mary Gibbs, who provided the voice of Boo. (see the commentary of Monster's, Inc,) All in all, Monster's, Inc. is a great movie. Watch it. My score: 10/10",10,0,1,24 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Better than the book!!
","When I first watched this film, I had no idea what the subject was. I hadn't heard of the author, J.R.R. Tolkien, and the story was confusing. I also was watching the short edition, not the extended edition, now available.However, when the movie was over, I had changed. This movie was superb! Fantastic! I loved the prologue, the music, the sword battles. I also loved the fact that the director made it so, when an arm or head was cut off, nothing gushed out. He also followed the book very well, although I didn't read the book until after the third movie came out.The cast was perfect. I don't see how anyone wouldn't like this trilogy. The next two films were even better. But this film was a great classic, and earns a spot on my Top 30 movies.",10,2,3,27 February 2006
The Village," Weird ending
","I once had this movie on my Top 30. I don't know why, but I'm sure glad I took it off.I never really appreciated the scene where Noah stabs Lucius. The movie is rated 'PG-13' for scary images and a scene of violence.' I knew immediately that that was the scene for which the movie was rated PG-13. Plus some scary images.The performance of Bryce Howard  daughter of Ron Howard  as Ivy Walker was really good. It's amazing that she played the part of a blind girl, and Bryce isn't blind herself.What really bugs me is the ending. It's so . . . . . dull. Ivy returns with the medicine to cure Lucius, and it just ends there.After his horrific crime in stabbing Lucius, Noah is taken to the 'Quiet Room.' There, he goes insane, and steals a costume of 'Those We Don't Speak Of.', who turn out to be non-existent.This is not a movie for young kids. It's definitely not M. Night Shymalan's best.My score: 6/10.",5,1,2,14 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Awful
","Being a big fan of the third book, I had high expectations when I went to see this movie. Boy, was I ever disappointed! This movie has many flaws, but I'll name just a few.1. The werewolf was supposed to have hair and a tail, as it says clearly in the book.2. The dementors were not supposed to fly. Only float.3. The Firebolt that Harry received was given to him by Sirius. In the book, it was on Christmas. In the movie, it was the end of the year.4. The director failed to explain the Maruader's Map, like who wrote it, and the fact that Harry's father was one of them.5. Trelawney's prediction was not explained enough. Like that fact that it was her second prediction overall. This turns out to be important in the fifth book.6. The Knight Bus was not done the right way at all. (It wasn't supposed to squeeze through two vehicles.)7. In the book, Harry does not yell, 'Expecto Patronum.' 8. They didn't show the Quidditch Final, which Gryffindor won.9. The actor who played Dumbledore, Michael Gambon, was not right for the part.(See * below.) 10. Dumbledore should have talked to Harry more.Those are, like I said, only a few (*) I know that Richard Harris passed away in 2002, but someone else should have played Dumbledore. Michael Gambon just wasn't right.Like I said above, I loved the third book, but this film was my least favorite. I haven't seen the fourth movie, but I doubt it'll beat the second movie, which is my favorite one so far.Unless you're a die-hard fan, avoid this movie. If you must watch it, read the book first. Otherwwise, you'll be completely lost.My Score: 6/10.",3,3,5,8 March 2006
Independence Day," Too much profanity
","The story is good. The acting is good. The battles are good.But the profanity, it's TOO much.I liked Bill Pullman's performance as the Commander-in-Chief, and Will Smith and all the other actors.Why the profanity? I know it's about an alien invasion, but cussing is never necessary. The movie is PG-13, but good grief. There's just too much bad language. Even this movie could have done without it.Other than the foul language, it's pretty good.**Spoilers ahead!!**I like how David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and Capt. Hiller (Will Smith) got out of the mother ship just in the nick of time, just before it blew up, along with the rest of the alien ships.What I don't like, besides the profanity, is the fact that the First Lady dies. What's up with that?My score: 6/10.Above, it's a 5. I didn't want to be on the 'Hated List' so I gave as low a score as I could. I do NOT love this move, nor do I hate it.",5,0,2,28 February 2006
Remember the Titans," Great movie
","I don't even like football, but this is one of few football-based movies that I enjoyed.I think this movie deserved an Oscar for the great movie that it is. Based on a true story, 'Remember the Titans' is a uplifting experience.It begins with a coach of a low-down high school football team. Coach Boone (Denzel Washington) and Coach Yoast (Will Patton) are combining blacks and whites; many people were racist back then, and the coaches wanted to put an end to that.Thanks to hard training, the boys finally made a great team, and that team won the state championship. Earlier, after a previous win, one of the jocks was involved in a fatal car accident. He lived for ten years after that.This is a great movie. Watch it if you like football.",8,1,2,27 March 2006
The Princess Bride," Good action movie
","***There is a minor spoiler below** First I want to say that I DO NOT hate this movie. I gave a '7' because there are a few things in this film that I strongly object to. 1. Inigo using the 'S' 'O' 'B' term. (right before he kills Count Rogan.)2. The grandson using a word in the wrong way. (When he finds out that the Prince doesn't die.)3. The R.O.U.S.'s (Rodents Of Unusual Size) fight was too long and not necessary.Other than those things, this is a entertaining movie. Not among my Top 30, nor will it ever be. Cary Elwes did a great job as Weslry, and I have to mention the great performance of Andre The Giant. He was funny, and very strong. Too bad he died in 1994. Anoother actor's performance is noteworthy. Mandy Patkintin and Wallace Shawn, who played Inigo and Vizini respectively. Billy Crystal stole the whole movie, even though he was only in the movie for about ten minutes. His character was very important as it turned out. Overall, this is a good movie, but I recommend you mute the words above, and the fight scene with the R.O.U.S.'s. My Score: 7/10",7,2,4,2 March 2006
The Little Mermaid," Blech!
","When I was a little kid, (when the movie was brand-new) I used to dance to the song, 'Under the Sea.' Now I just avoid this movie altogether. I'm a guy, and guys like me really don't like mushy movies, like this one. I found it a little dull, and King Triton was not a very nice 'person' until near the end, when he turns Ariel back to a human.Ursela was an interesting villain, but she got what she deserved. Her two eels, Flotsam and Jetsom, were sizzled and destroyed, thanks to Ariel, who forced Ursela to point the triton at them, instead of Eric.Really, we would have been better off without a movie like this one. The songs are classified as 'annoying' and the story is classified as 'stupid.' My score: 2/10.",2,11,44,20 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Second movie of Great Trliogy!
","I love this movie! It's even better than the first one. I actually saw this for th first time just weeks after I saw the first movie for the first time.This has so many graphics and special effects, it's hard to know where to begin.**Minor spoiler ahead.** I like the part when you see a flashback, to when before Boromir was killed. You see that Boromir and Faramir were the best of friends, and their father, who wasn't very nice to Faramir, seemed to only love Boromir. After Boromir is killed, Dethomir blames Faramir. But Faramir only does what he feels is right. (Except for the time where he took Frodo and Sam to Gondor.) Not only is this a terrific movie, but it could not have been better. It may be too long for some people, but it it not too long to me.I think it is amazing that the two actors who played Boromir and Faramir have a certain resemblance.It is only 3 hours and 43 minutes long, and there's at least a half hour alone on the credits.If you like the first movie, you won't be disappointed in this movie.My Score: 10/10.",10,1,1,27 February 2006
The Incredibles," The Incredibles: a great film
","'The Incredibles' is No. 3 on my list, so read carefully if you're unsure of watching this film. ***Spoilers ahead***'The Incredibles' is a great film about a family of superheroes who are forced to retire after a series of lawsuits. The film begins simple enough: a young Bob Parr, or Mr. Incredible, who marries a superhero friend, Elastigirl. They later have three kids, Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack, who is still a baby. Dash is my favorite character. His power is speed, and I could really use speed since I'm the slowest guy in my class. Violet and Dash at first detest each other, but then they later save each other's lives several times each. Jack-Jack is too young to talk, and his powers aren't revealed until near the end. But he is sooooooooooooooo cute. Helen is a good mother, but she can be impatient at times. Bob is a little obese, but that's okay, because even he's not perfect. Frozone has the coolest power. He can throw ice from his fingertips. He would be an Olympic Gold Medalist, because he did a great job with that snowboard. Mr. Huph is a very short employer, but he sure has a big mouth. Voice by Wally Shawn. (Rex in Toy Story 1 and 2) Mirage is a nice-looking woman, but she can be brain-washed if you do it right. (Obviously Syndrome couldn't, so you probably couldn't) Syndrome has a big problem, and it led to his somewhat horrible death.All in all, this movie IS worth seeing, even if you aren't a big action/adventurous fan.",10,0,0,23 February 2006
Shrek 2," Even worse than the first one
","If I thought the first one was bad, I was wrong. I didn't think Dreamworks could do worse than the original. Andnow I heard there's going to be a third Shrek. WHAT ARE EARTH ARE YOU THINKING?!?!?!?!?!?!? I don't think it can sink lower.***SPOLIERS AHEAD*** Shrek and Fiona are invited by her parents, (voice by Julie Andrews and John Cleese) to go to their castle a long way from their swamp. When they get there, sparks fly. The king is visited by the Fairy Godmother, from Cinderella. She persuades him to have Shrek killed. He hires Puss in Boots, who is known for killing giants and other evil beings. But instead of killing Shrek, he coughs up a hairball. He eventually joins Shrek's side. I don't like the fact that the Fairy Godmother is the 'villian' of this movie. She's supposed to be nice, and they make her nasty.Don't bother watching this movie. It's not worth the risk of wasting money.My Score: 1/10.",1,5,18,21 March 2006
A Bug's Life," This movie is so underrated.
","At first, when it came out, 'A Bug's Life was my least favorite Pixar film. I disliked the story, and a few scenes were especially weird, but then I saw it again last year on DVD for the first time and I really loved it! I had no idea that Phyllis Diller did the voice of the queen ant. (P.D. makes a guest appearance on Full House in the first season.) I had never heard of Dave Foley, and I wasn't too familiar with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, since I never watch Seinfield. (too much profanity) I did recognize P.T. Flea's vi=ace, because I'm a huge fan of both Toy Story movies. ***Spoilers*** Anyway, Flik, voice by Foley, is a accident-prone ant sent by his colony to hire warrior bugs, and he (thinks) finds them, but they turn out to be circus clowns. I must have missed the comedy before, but last year I listened to just the music at some parts, and it became one of my favorite movies. (Listen to just the music on the DVD) Kevin Spacey did the voice of Hopper, the leader of the grasshopper gang. He did a great speech at the grasshopper's hideout, and I really liked it when he did that funny scene with Molt at the anthill. A Bug's Life is given my full approval, and I recommend it for everyone.",10,1,2,24 February 2006
Toy Story," Great film about toys
","Toy Story is the first fully computer-animated film. It tells the story of a cowboy toy named Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) who is jealous when a new toy arrives, Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Buzz thinks he's a space ranger, and is eventually 'disposed of' accidentally by Woody. (Woody had only meant to knock Buzz behind a dresser) Woody and Buzz eventually become friends, and had it not been for that friendship, Buzz would have been . . well, I'll let you see it yourself. Toy Story, while a great film, is the only Pixar to not be among my Top 10. But still, I think it's worth watching. It may not be log enough, but not all good movies have to be 2-3 hours long. My Score: 9/10",9,1,1,24 February 2006
Singin' in the Rain," Some of the songs are corny.
","This is one of the best and worst musical movies made. The performances of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds was great, but I was semi-disappointed in some of the songs. I really didn't like the 'Gotta Dance' video thing, and the woman who tosses the coin over and over, that was really corny.On the other hand, the song that\'s called, 'Make 'em laugh!' was really good. Especially when Cosmo crashed through the wall. The Lima thing sounded rally psycho. Her voice made me want to cringe. But I guess that's how Jean Hagen's character spoke. Good movie. But only watch it if you really like any of the three main actors.My Score: 6/10.",6,3,7,24 March 2006
Toy Story 2," Better than the first one!
","Toy Story 2 is great! I loved it. It's even better than the original; mostly because you get to know the characters a bit more, and we get to see Tim Allen do more than one Buzz's voice **Spoiler** I love the beginning, where you see Buzz on a strange planet, and for a few seconds you get to see the inside of Buzz's helmet. The funny part is that you hear him breathing, and it sounds exactly like Darth Vader! While it's definitely not perfect, it sure has some good humor. We get to meet some new characters, Bullseye, Jesse, and the prospector 'Stinky Pete.' Watch Toy Story 1 before you watch this movie, otherwise you won't understand it.",10,0,1,24 February 2006
National Treasure," Nicholas Cage in a PG movie?? Unreal!!
","I found this movie to be rather good. It has real historical background, while the story itself being fiction. ***Spoilers ahead!!!*** Nicholas Cage plays Ben Gates. A man who, as a boy, learns of a treasure that the Founding Fathers had hidden from the British. The clues were on the back of the Declaration of Indepndence, which they somehow managed to steal. (The following sentence is a no-brainer.) They didn't really use the real artifact, it would have been broken up after being exposed to air.(see the errors page.) The acting was a bit awkward. Cage does a good job, though. Jon Voight as his father also did OK. The real problem with this movie is that it really didn't explain how the Fathers knew about the treasure, even though in reality, it didn't exist. Overall, though, the movie was pretty good. If there is ever a sequel, it better be as good, if not better than this film. My Scores:Story: 9/10 Acting: 7.5/10Overall: 7/10",7,1,1,24 February 2006
It's a Wonderful Life," My All Time Favorite Movie!!
","***Warning!!! Spoilers are ahead!!!! Do not read if you have not seen this movie!!!*** James Stewart plays a banker named George Bailey. The main part of the movie is a flashback, where we see the main part of his early life. We see him grow up from a small boy of 12 to when he's in his 40's. James Stewart is the best actor who has ever lived. This is my opinion, and you can have yours, but I still LOVE this movie, even though I only watch it 2 times a year at the most. I would watch it every day if I could. If you love Jimmy Stewart, you will love this movie. SHAME on all those who don't like this movie. It has zero profanity, zero inappropriate scenes, and ZERO violence. This kind of movie is appropriate for ALL ages. It is pretty sad that this kind of movie can rarely be found being made today. Watch this movie. You WON'T regret it! : )",10,2,8,23 February 2006
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," My favorite HP movie so far
","This is, so far, the best Harry Potter film made. I hated the third movie, I have yet to see the fourth movie, and the first one is a little lower on my Favorite Movies List.But this is my favorite HP film so far.***Spoliers*** I love the actors. Only Daniel Radcliffe can do Harry Potter. No one else comes close. The same applies to Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.In the book, when Malfoy called Hermione a 'Mudblood,' Hermione did not know what it meant. However, in the movie, she did know what it meant. This, I like. It made better sense for her to know what it meant, and for Hagrid, not Ron, to explain what it meant.The third book is my favorite by far, bu the movie makers made BIG mistakes. Too many things were changed or taken out.But this film, directed by Chris Columbus, was superb. Watch the first movie you watch this one, or read the books first. And make sure, if you watch the third movie, read the book first! Otherwise, you won't understand a thing.My Score: 9/10.",8,0,3,2 March 2006
Ice Age," Good story, poor animation.
","I hated the fact that the animators made it so the humans looked like they were halfway from evolving from apes. They didn't talk at all through the whole movie. What's up with that? On the other hand, the story is fairly good. I like the humor of Manfred, the giant mammoth, (voiced by Ray Ramano) and Sid, the dumb sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo). Diego was a good character too, voiced by Denis Leary. (who also voices Francis the male ladybug in 'A Bug's Life.') The finding and returning the human 'baby' though, is a little typical. Why must it always be a 'find and rescue' type of thing?' Though, 'Finding Nemo' is an example of a great 'search and rescue' -type movie.The humans were poorly animated, and as I said before, look like half-apes and half-human. We all should know by now that evolution is still an unproven theory. It's 100% theory, nothing more.'Ice Age' is not among my Top 30, nor will it ever will be. But it still is an average movie, so if you have nothing better to do, watch it. Otherwise, pick something else.My Score: 6/10.",6,0,2,9 March 2006
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Pretty Good
","I've seen this movie only once, and that was a long time ago. Since I was a fan of Alec Guiness, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I was not disappointed. His performance gave him the Oscar he won. He did magnificently, and I strongly recommend this movie for people who like good war movies.British World War 2 prisoners of war are given the task, by their Japanese captors, of building a railway bridge in an Asian jungle. Led by Col Nicholson, (Guiness)a British officer, the prisoners score a moral victory over the Japanese by not only building the bridge, but running the whole show. Unknown to Nicholson, an allied demolition team are planning to destroy the bridge once it's completed.A great war film. 7/10.",7,0,1,23 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not the best, but not the worst
","I waited over a month after the movie came out to see it. I love the music for the saga, and I think John Williams did a super job with it.**Minor spoilers ahead** You can hen imagine how anxious I felt when I watched it. Hayden and McGregor did super jobs, and I think the light saber battle between Skywalker/Vader and Kenobi was terrific.I was shocked when I saw Chewbacca in this film. He's 200 years old in the 4th episode, so I knew he'd be alive. I just didn't think I'd see him in this film.Overall, it was Okay. I didn't hate it, but I didn't fall in love with it because it was so sad. It was Rated PG-13, and it definitely needed that Rating. Small children, ages 10 and younger, should NOT watch this film. Make them wait until they're ten, but take extra precautions.Unless you're a die-hard Star Wars fan, be careful who watches this film.My Scores: Acting: 8/10 Story: 6.5/10 Overall: 8/10",8,0,0,28 February 2006
The Lion King," The Lion King
","When I first watched The Lion King, I had mixed feelings about it. I've never been a fan of Elton John, and his songs are less than impressive.In this film, however, since he wasn't the one singing, I enjoyed them very much. I especially liked the songs, 'I Just can't Wait to be King,' and 'Hakuna Matata.' (Next sentence is a spoiler.) I also enjoyed Pumbaa and Timon's karate action at Pride Rock.The voice cast is amazing. Jonathan Taylor Thomas as young Simba, Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar; Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, James Earl Jones as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. The three hyena, Bezaai, Shenzi, and Ed were voiced by Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Cummings, respectively.The Lion King is a great movie, and is well worth your time.My Score: 10/10.",10,0,0,27 February 2006
Shrek," Yuck.
","I can't really believe that this movie won Best Animated Deature over 'Monsters, Inc.' I have not seen a movie that is so bizarre and stupid as this one. They make fun of Disney by putting Disney characters in the movie, such as Pinocchio, the three little pigs, the big bad wolf, the seven Dwarfs, and so on. I don't like movies that make fun of other companies who spend many man hours making good movies. Shrek was not the best movie I have ever seen. I can't say, however, that there aren't any funny parts. I think that 'Donkey' should be given an actual name. He is really annoying, that's really what makes this movie not worth watching.My Score: 2/10.",2,6,13,21 March 2006
The Emperor's New Groove," New Groove's is Spade's only good film
","David Spade is awesome. He provided the perfect funny voice of the Emperor. Ihave seen a clips of Spade's show, 'Just Shoot Me,' and I found it very unfunny.In this film, however, Spade portray's the Emeror perfectly. No one else could have done that voice.John Goodman did a great job as Pacha. Like Spade, no one could have done that role so well.This film is full of laughs. Anyone with even a small sense of humor should have this film in their homes. The DVD is perfect, and I am very glad that it's finally available.My Score: 10/10.",10,1,2,27 February 2006
Ben-Hur," Pefect movie . . . almost
","I really can't think of any flaws in this movie, as I haven't seen it for years,but I do remember the brilliant performance of Oscar Winner Charlton Heston (The Ten Commandments). He meets an old friend, and his friend, Quinton Arrius, invites him to do something that Ben-Hur refuses to do. I don't remember what the offer involved, but it was not something good. Soon, they separate, and become bitter enemies.Circumstances lead Ben-Hur and Arrius to a great chariot race, and while Ben-Hur's mother and two sisters have leprosy, Ben-Hur prepares for the great race. Arrius, unfortunately, is cheating. His chariot has sharp spikes attached to the wheels, and, while moving, when it touched another moving chariot, it would cut into the wheel and disable the chariot.Ben-Hur, of course wins the race, and Arrius is badly injured. Before he dies, he tells Ben-Hur about his family. Ben-Hur finds his mother and two sisters, and they are later healed by Jesus, before he is crucified.This is a great movie, and I highly recommend it for people who love action movies.My Score: 9/10.",9,0,2,27 March 2006
Signs," Creeeeeeeepy!
","I haven't seen this film in over six months, but I remember it well.The only thing that makes this movie good is that Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix are in it. Their performances are terrific. I don't appreciate the language they use, and the young boy, Morgan, (Rory Culkin) uses a term that I strongly object to.***MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE!!!!*** The story, on the other hand is pretty good. This movie is no longer among my Top 30 list, but it would probably be on my top 50.The death of the two dogs should not have had to happen, though. I don't think that the male dog should have gotten violent, and Isabel, the female dog, should not have had to die the way she did.We don't actually see her die. We assume she dies, by way of the aliens that come to their farm.Overall, it's worth seeing on Halloween. I would not recommend little kids watching it, however. Also, do not watch it alone, and do not watch it in the middle of the night, or in a cornfield! My score: 7/10",7,0,4,14 March 2006
Cinderella," Not a guy's movie
","I'm a guy, so I naturally wouldn't appreciate this movie as much as others. I know that without this movie, there wouldn't be a castle in Walt Disney World - I've never been there; I've only been to Disneyland - but other than that, I really don't see what all the excitement is about.I do know that the same person who did the evil step -mother's voice is the same one who did Meleficent's voice in Sleeping Beauty' This would be a definite ten, but like I said, I'm a guy, and the songs stay in my head and won't go away. It's very annoying.My score: 3/10.",3,4,24,15 March 2006
Rear Window," Great suspense film
","In one of James Stewart's best films, he plays L. B. Jefferies, a photographer with a broken leg. The broken leg was due to an accident several weeks before: He had gone out in front of a car racer, and it ran over him. It actually didn't run over him, it just hurt him a lot.Since he's confined to a wheelchair for a while, Jefferies has time on his hands. He looks across the street and sees a suspicious man acting very strange. He uses binoculars to spy on this man, whom Jeffries strongly suspects of murder.If you feel like watching a good suspense movie, this is the one to see. This is one of Hitchcocks's best movies, and it get's a 9/10 from me.",9,1,4,23 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The final movie of the spectacular trilogy
","This is, by far, the best movie of the LOTR trilogy. It is very long, but it is worth every minute. I can think of only a precious few (no pun intended) movies, specifically, action movies, that are better than this movie.I love Andy Serkis's Gollum/Smeagol voice. I have a friend who can sound just like Gollum, although he is no match for Andy Serkis.***WARNING!!! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!*** Frodo Baggins is nearing the end of his journey to destroy the evil Ring, along with Sam and Gollum. We find that, after 'leaving' Smeagol in TTT, Gollum apparently is back in ROTK. He talks to himself a lot, and has an evil plan of getting rid of Sam. He poisons Frodo's mind, and Frodo sends Sam away. Later, however, Sam returns and injures Shelob, the humongous spider that lived in the cave that Gollum sent Frodo in. Later, it's Gollum, not Frodo, who destroys the Ring. Gollum, of course dies in the process. Sauron is destroyed as well. The explosion of his tower is excellent.The final battles, the acting, the music, and everything else in this movie is 100% perfect.My score: 10/10",10,3,6,27 February 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of the Best in the saga
","This was the first Star Wars movie that I ever saw. I first saw it back in 1990. (I think)I was only 6 at the time; I really didn't understand the meaning of the story.Now that I'm 21, I understand it perfectly. As I said in the comment I made about Episode VI, the three main characters were portrayed perfectly. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher played Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, respectively. Only those three actors could have played the roles.As for Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he did well. I hadn't heard of Alec Guiness until this movie, nor had i seen any of his movies.**Minor spoilers ahead** I loved the final battle of the Death Star, though the death of Obi-Wan made me a bit queasy. I also noticed, now that I've seen all 6 movies, Yoda is not in this movie. He appears in the other 5, but is not in this one at all.My Score: 7.5/10.",7,1,2,28 February 2006
Tarzan," Phil Collins rocks!
","Tarzan is among my favorite movies. I usually don't like movies, that have songs in them,especially animated movies, but Tarzan is one exception.Being a big fan of Phil Collins, I really loved this movie. The story is great, and the voice talents are superb.**Spoilers ahead**Tarzan is found by Kala (voice of Glenn Close), who saves him from a evil leopard, Sabor. Sabor had killed Tarzan's parents, who had been shipwrecked on Africa.Kala, along with Terk, a young female gorilla, take care of Tarzan.As an adult, Tarzan discovers humans in the jungle. Until then, he had never seen another human before. (Except his parents, but he was only a baby at the time that they were killed.) He learns more about them, and is betrayed by one of them, Clayton, who has an evil plot to capture the gorillas and use them for various things.The songs were written and performed by Phil Collins. His score is also done really well.The interesting thing about this movie is that it has 6 deaths. More than any other Disneyy film. I won't name the deaths, because it would be a big spoiler.My Score: 8/10",8,2,3,10 March 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Not bad
","At first, I didn't like this film because so many bad things happen to the Alliance. Here's a few: **Spoilers ahead** 1. The Rebel Base at Hoth is crushed and a lot of them are killed.2. The Millennium Falcon is captured, Han Solo eventually frozen in a block of carbonite.3. Luke's right hand is cut off by Darth Vader in a dual.4. George Lucas did not direct this film.Other than that, it's not all that bad of a movie. I'd only watch it if there's nothing better to watch. But to me, there always is.My Score: 6/10",6,1,13,1 March 2006
Aladdin," Excellent
","Aladdin is one of the best animated movies that has ever been made. Featuring the voice talents of Robin Williams as the Genie, Scott Weinger as Aladdin, and Gilbert Gottfried as Iago the parrot. The villain, Jafar, has an evil plot to get his hand on a magic lamp, which contained a genie that would grant three wishes to whomever set him free. The princess, Jasmine, is being forced to marry within three days by her father. Her father means well, but she had had enough with all the bragging rich princes' that had come to court her. Through weird circumstances, Aladdin gets hold of the lamp, thanks to his pet monkey, Abu. The genie is a fun-loving guy who takes a liking to Aladdin right away. He has a great sense of humor, and he told Aladdin that if he got a wish, it would be freedom. Aladdin promised the genie that after he makes his first two wishes, he'll use his third wish to set the genie free. Theyt shake hands, and the genie grants Aladdin's first wish: to become a prince. Eventually, Jafar gets a hold of the lamp, and tries to get rid of Aladdin but not before he Aladdin returns, gets rid of Jafar and Iago for good, and then the Sultan changes the law. Aladdin finally fulfills his promise to the genie by wishing him free.This is a great movie. My Score: 9/10.",9,1,1,27 March 2006
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Not as good as Raiders
","This movie was okay, but it wasn't as good as the first movie.There's one good reason I don't like this one as much as Raiders, and that's the fact that Harrison Ford uses a profanity term that I find very objectionable. I won't say it here, but if you want to record it off the TV, and you know where to look, I recommend pausing the recorder at the moment he uses the term.Sean Connery is Jones's father, and his father is kidnapped, and taken to some foreign country. Indy goes to find him, bringing with him a diary that his father sent him. This was a big mistake. It was also a mistake to trust anyone. He was told by his friend, Walter Donavan, to not trust anyone.**End spoilers** No more spoilers from here on. I'll just say it's a good movie, but eight-and-under's should not watch it. It's much too intense.My score: 6/10.",6,4,10,24 March 2006
The Wizard of Oz," Not one of my favorites
","I do NOT hate this movie, although my post might appear in the 'Hated it' section.Aside from the extremely annoying songs, this would be a very good movie. Songs like, 'The Wicked Witch is Dead,' and 'If I Were King of the Forest' are among the most annoying.There is one song that is always worth listening to. It's 'Over the Rainbow,' which was voted the best movie song ever. I disagree with that, but it's still a very good song.The only other thing that really bothers me about this movie is the fact that it's so predictable. I knew they would eventually make it, and the Witch of the West would somehow 'die', and that the Wizard was the same guy who played the doorman and the cabbie (carriage driver.) Frank Morgan, who plays numerous roles, including the Wizard, did his roles very well. Judy Garland and all the others did well, too.Unless you're a fan, don't watch this movie very often. It is Rated 'G,' but there are a few intense moments.My Score: 6/10.",6,4,18,8 March 2006
