First Man," Best space film since Apollo 13.
","Neil Armstrong was a completely focused, tightly wrapped person. First Man develops that side of his personality extremely well. The trauma of losing his daughter was an undercurrent in his life as well, and that was brought home. I've seen a lot of space films and documentaries, and this one is the first to really drive home the brain-shattering violence of riding a rocket into space.",9,77,168,2 October 2018
