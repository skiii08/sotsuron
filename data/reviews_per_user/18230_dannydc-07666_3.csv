Insidious: Chapter 2," Review 09 - Insidious Chapter 2
","The Second chapter for this awesome horror series picks off exactly from the end of the first movie with the death of Elise. This time its Josh who is affected with the image of the woman in black from his childhood. Josh is a suspect for the death of Elise, so they stay with his mother Lorraine whilst police check for evidence. However, shortly after their arrival, the parasites then begin to try and take over Josh's body; as he has been to the Further before.The second chapter is very similar to the first. However their is more showings of the other characters. There are many scary scenes, and an awful lot of job scares. There is also a change of scenery then the old house, as about half hour of the film shows an abandoned hospital. The thing that i really like here is how the ghost that Josh has been seeing was a patient in the hospital, who use to dress up as the woman to commit murders. I thought that this was a clever idea. I still feel that chapter 1 was slightly better than the second one. This is because the story was much more simple, and easier to understand than the second one. But again, actors are outstanding, music is awesome and the jump scares are fantastic. This is turning out to be one of my favorite horror series, and i recommend this title.",7,0,0,9 March 2018
Insidious," Review 08 - Insidious
","Insidious is about a normal family that have just moved into a new area. A few weeks later tragedy arises beyond the family as Reenae and Josh's son Dalton falls off a ladder; ending up in a coma. Since that incident, the family have been experiencing horrific and terrifying monsters, aiming to cause pain on the family. After hiring a group of professionals, we actually find out that Dalton was never been in a coma. His physical body has remained on Earth, but his mental body has been taken over by the monsters, and it trapped in a place known as the 'Further'. We also find out that Josh has also been in the same situation, as he has been dreaming of a creepy woman dressed in black.This movie is scary. I need to point that out now. The director has done an amazing job on making this movie terrifying. I struggled to go around my own home at night with the thoughts of the monsters in my mind! The music and the jump scares are also fantastic.All of the actors do a fantastic job of portraying their characters. But the star of the film for me is Lin Shaye. Her character is by far the most likeable throughout the whole movie. But everyone does a great job! This movie is one of my favourite horrors of all time. Its the only one i have seen in the series so i can't wait to review the next 3. I recommend this movie to all horror fans, as you will be creeped out!",8,0,0,8 March 2018
Sausage Party," Review 03 - Sausage Party
","Sausage party tells the story of foods in a supermarket imagining life on the outside of the store. Their mission is to get chosen by the humans to begin a new life on the outside. After viewing the trailer, this film was automatically on my to watch list. Unfortunately i was disappointed.I am just going to mention that the swearing is very often and over used. In fact most sentences said by the characters contain at least 1 swear word. I know this is an adult humor title, but they could have calmed that down!The story is pretty good however. There were moments where i couldn't stop laughing on some parts; other parts tried to be funny but failed. I did enjoy the beginning song that introduced some of the characters, it added a warm and funny start to the rest of the film.Sausage Party definitely has the most messed up and disturbing ending scene out of any film i have watched. It dragged on for a while which made me just want the film the end quicker. The whole of the last scene went on for ages which just got boring and very strange towards the end. Overall this film was alright. If you enjoy films that are over the top with attempted comedy and sexual references then I would say maybe rent this title. I just think you would be disappointed in my opinion. I love animated comedy titles but this one just didn't really make me laugh as much as i hoped for.",5,1,2,15 February 2018
