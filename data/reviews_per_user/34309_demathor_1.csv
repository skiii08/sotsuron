Requiem for a Dream," Masterpiece of modern tragic theater
","I have just seen this movie for the first time, after hearing many mixed comments about it. After seeing it, I agree that this movie is utterly unforgettable, and I believe it is indeed a masterpiece of modern theater.The first thing that struck me about this movie was the title, 'Requiem for a Dream'  This is a seemingly ingenious, poetic title, which fits the movie perfectly.  As you probably know, the movie tells the tale of four drug-addicted teenagers trying to struggle their way through life and the depths of addiction.  It is the way in which the movie tells it that strikes the viewer, and instills an unforgettable and clear message.Quite possibly the most disturbing thing about the movie is that most viewers can easily relate to one of the characters. As I was watching the movie, I could see myself (however terribly unlikely, but possible) becoming Harry.  I also could envision some people I know ending up like Marion or Tyrone. Sadly, I could also see my mother (although however unlikely) becoming much like Sarah Goldfarb.  I think this is because the individual personalities and dispositions of each of the characters is not particularly detailed, and we only get a general sketch of their behavior, which seems rather typical and not particularly unique to each character, but moreso typical to the type of person, age group, ethnicity, etc. that they are. This allows us to conceive a more broad perception of the characters, and relate them to ourselves or other people. The movie is a very realistic depiction of modern life, and the circumstances that befall the characters could easily occur in real life.  While the addiction might be somewhat exaggerated, medical conditions be unrealistic, and the behavior of some characters be also somewhat unrealistic, they all serve a function in relaying the main message of the film, and such errors are in my opinion, thus permissable.There are some naysayers who believe that this movie is too intense, twisted, vivid and plain sick to deliver its message.  While I can relate to their viewpoint, as the movie is extremely harsh, I think that element is necessary to instill the full moral of the movie.  By viewing these gruesome and unforgettable images, and hearing this twisted tale, it makes us boldly remember the wisdom that the writer is trying to share with us.  It is a message about addiction, about the fall of people not so different than you or I, a modern day tragedy.In short, this is a masterpiece of modern theater.  In recent times media, TV and film has pushed the limit of how far they could go in terms of being vulgar, gruesome, gory or violent.  It is only fitting that drama and tragedy also push this limit.  Requiem for a Dream is a modern tragedy that pushes the viewers psyche to the very limit, and bestows an unforgettable portrait of the downfall of people.I highly recommend viewing this movie at least once, unless you are faint of heart. 10/10",10,1,2,21 June 2002
