Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Awesome for a movie, but only pretty good for Tarantino (spoilers)
","If you've not seen the movie, and don't want to know what happens, stop reading now.I really enjoyed watching this movie but I think that the fascinating character of Pei Mei should've been given more depth.  I also don't think that the way he died at all made sense to the rest of the movie and I found the manner of death and the fact that he died extraneous.Uma Thurman is a bad ass as usual but her best scene was the scene where she rips out Elle's other eye and steps on it.  That scene *RULED* but the fact that you don't know what happens to her ultimately bothers me.  I did like the credits with the cross-out motif.  That was creative.I think that David Carradine, the actor that played Bill, the title character, was boring.  I was expecting someone more interesting to play that character.  Someone more bad ass like Clint Eastwood or something.  I think his death was ironically non-violent and I liked it, it was appropriate.
I rated this movie a 10 because I found it highly entertaining and compared to most other movies that've come out lately, it ROCKED.",10,0,1,19 April 2004
Catch Me If You Can," What a GREAT story!
",This movie has a great storyline and was perfectly cast.  I loved Tom Hanks' accent! It wasn't completely obvious what was going to happen next like in a lot of other movies that come out.  I had never heard of this guy and I think that it's a really cool story and I'm very glad they made a movie out of it. I gave it a 10 because it showed the story of this guys life in an entertaining and comic way without completely leaving out how hard certain parts of his life must've been. You NEED to see this movie,10,0,1,8 January 2003
Shaun of the Dead," Witty British Spoof tackles lots of issues
","I went into watching this film not knowing too much about it. I was originally expecting a pure comedy, but that's not what it is.While 'Shaun of the Dead' is predominantly a spoof of 'Dawn of the Dead', it does touch on a variety of different topics in a semi-serious way.The title character Shaun is a 29 year old stuck in a dead end job supervising teenage co-workers. He can't seem to get it right with his girlfriend, Liz, and he never goes to visit his mother.What makes this movie hilarious is that it took an apocalyptic event for Shaun to get his life in gear. While that doesn't sound funny, it surely is made funny by Simon Pegg's performance as Shaun.Great dialog, a new twist on a common horror theme, and a little seriousness thrown in make this a great film. I wouldn't take anyone squeamish to go see it, but all violence is made to look obviously fake and is done in a slap-stick manner.Catch this one when you can, it's spectacular!",9,0,1,9 January 2005
Titanic," TOO LONG!
",This movie was too long and drawn out. It was unrealistic with bad acting on Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's part.  I also found the dialog cheesy 'I'm the king of the world?' it was exceedingly hard to sit through let alone take seriously and as a result I'm forced to give it a 1,5,0,4,23 October 2002
Enemy at the Gates," cookie cutter failure
","While I was excited to see Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes in the same movie, `Enemy at the Gates' still managed to disappoint me both in plot and acting. This movie is another in the series of easily predictable cookie cutter `war/love' films to come out of Hollywood.  Peppered with irrelevant metaphors of wolves and donkeys, I found myself laughing at the moments that were supposed to be serious.  For example, Danilov says, `What we need is a hero.'  Khrushchev sarcastically replies, `Do you know any heroes?'  Danilov answers, `I know one.'   Please, this scene happens in every movie. Naturally after that conversation, the camera moves to the main character, who is also the `hero' previously talked about. 	As for the romance, it was completely unnecessary.  The romance was so forced.  There were no sparks between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz.  The love scene in the barracks was completely unbelievable as well as unpassionate. First, I thought it was totally lame that they make the girl start it especially if we're supposed to believe that she's a virgin.  Second, she looked as if she were in pain during the whole sex part and if they were really in love, he would act like he cared instead of pounding away.  Third, like the guy walking through wouldn't notice, let's get realistic here. 	I personally think that I may have enjoyed the movie if Tania character were a guy or not in the movie at all.  The love was not only forced, but was completely unnecessary and took away from the movie instead of making it better.  Her character was a complete stereotype the `smart strong independent coy tomboy.'  How she was going to be involved was so obvious and bland.  I was relieved when she got shot, I thought there was going to be a plot twist, but alas she miraculously bounced back to perfect health in some random hospital.  It was clear that the love part of the movie was in it because it was part of this equation that supposedly equals `good epic film.' 	Visually, I got pretty tired of the shaking and moving camera during fight scenes and scenes with sniper stuff.  I know that it was supposed to create confusion and discomfort like the characters feel, but it didn't work for me for over two hours.  I did however, really like the fonts that they used on screen in the beginning and again in the credits in the end.  I think those parts were visually well done.  The favorite part of the movie was the part with the map and the Nazi regime looking like black blood infesting Europe. I thought that was a great visual representation of what was happening at that time.  The only scene that had any positive impact on me was the beginning when all the soldiers were being forced out of the train to battle to fight and most likely die.  That scene was pretty well done but the blood explosions in slow motion were a little too much. 	This movie was trying to be a riveting `epic film' geared toward everyone with war and explosions for guys and love and `hot guys' for girls.  With all these supposedly promising ingredients the film didn't work because there was no chemistry between Fiennes and Law or between Law and Weisz. This is a hard thing to not have because they were trying to portray these dramatic roles that were very heavy and serious but instead the acting and `love' scenes made me laugh instead of identify with them.",1,5,12,17 February 2003
