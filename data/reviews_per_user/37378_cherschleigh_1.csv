Blade Runner 2049," Drags on, and on, and on.....
","Don't get me wrong...I loved the original, but this one is just junk. Yeah it won awards....but look at the box office numbers. Way low for a sequel to a wonderful movie. Trying to ride on the coattails of the original. So sad that all that time and energy went into the making of this movie. IMHO.",3,3,6,16 June 2018
