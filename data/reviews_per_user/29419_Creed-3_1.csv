The Blair Witch Project," A very good ... home movie
","It is very good, though think more of great suspense that great horror... But in the end, its a very good .... home movie....I just have a problem with all these critics calling it a cinematic masterpiece. Let's call this movie for what it is.....Some people may be surprised when they go to see that nearly all of the movie was shot on videotape and never fills the who screen. Think the square projection you had for 'How Bugs Eat' in third grade class.I know that they were after the affect of it being an amateur movie, and that isn't my problem. The thing is that most of the ad libbed dialogue just comes off too amateurish and contrived.... Coming out, I remembered the movies my brothers and I used to make on videotape. I'm planning on submitting our pictures 'Hopping Plague Invades North Hollywood', 'Saddam Hussein on MTV' and 'Bono and Edge Get Drunk' for Academy consideration. It's good, but just not that good... If you come in expecting a home movie and not a cinematic masterpiece, you may feel better about this movie...",2,0,2,2 August 1999
