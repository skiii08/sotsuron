Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Reminded me of Saving Private Ryan
","The humor in this movie reminded me of the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan: I started to cringe as I wondered who was about to be destroyed next. Sacha Cohen absolutely screws with very real and very decent people, and he does so in the most disgusting ways possible. For example, his helpless foreigner character attends a social gathering and dinner with a group of Christians, including a church Pastor and his wife, when he asks to be excused to go to the bathroom. When he returns he brings a plastic bag of his own feces back to the dinner table with him and asks what to do with it (under the guise that he is a helpless foreigner). These decent people are shocked but try to forgive his naivet√© in the matter, and one woman even tries to give the poor foreigner lessons on using an American bathroom. These same decent people again try to be flexible when a prostitute shows up at their house for dinner (that Sacha Cohen has called while off at the restroom), but then snap and tell him to leave, yelling at him on his way out and calling the cops. These were real people he did this to, not movie characters. He took advantage of their trust and decency and screwed with them based on that fact. This is just one example of many that are essentially the same. Many of the scenes are so obtuse that he seems to be screwing with his movie audience as well. Also, I was SO BORED with much of it that I actually considered leaving early, but I wanted to see if anything better might occur. Unfortunately, nothing ever did. I would have to guess that all these other people who are giving this sack-of-trash film fantastic reviews are the same ones who like to act just as obnoxiously themselves. I could never claim to be above anyone in this world, and so I won't pretend to be outraged. But I know that I would never waste my time watching this Borat character again. In fact, I'd like my money back for the movie ticket. Sacha Cohen, there were a few funny things in this film, but YOU SUCK for what you did to all those people.",2,17,36,14 November 2006
The Dark Knight," Legitimate dark film
","This is not an inspirational superhero film. This is a nice, gritty, dark story. Good people die unfairly, and others struggle with their losses. The intensity is well dramatized by the actors and the supporting sounds.The psychopath is scary in the worst way...in a legitimate way. Psychopaths never stop gaming, it's all they know, and it's usually about bringing their normal targets, outwardly good people, down to their lowest level. The storytellers fully recognize those facts. The intellectual twists, games and suspense remind me of the Jason Bourne films. Yeah, that good.You will sense the point when you think a normal film would have ended, but there is still more to come...another dark story to finish.You will not leave the theater feeling inspired, because there is no happy ending. But you will likely recognize and appreciate the legitimacy of this dark tale. Mr. Nolan and company will find it extremely difficult to match the quality of this story in the future.We should all relish in it while we can.",10,4,10,18 July 2008
