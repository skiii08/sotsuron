The Avengers," The avengers is another masterpiece in the marvel Universe
","Avengers Initiative The Avengers is an action packed film that leaves one asking for more. This film takes your classic comic book heroes and brings them to life on the big screen. From the very beginning the characters are already set in place previous movies. That is right if you don't want to be lost you unfortunately have some homework to do first. This should not be too difficult of a task. Marvel takes many of their beloved Heroes and puts them all together in a super powered formula. This team is a 'time bomb' just waiting to explode. The characters are as different as night and day which causes many clashes from physical beat downs, to witty and comical banter between them. All the Heroes have one common goal that in the end brings them all together, the fight for the 'greater good'. The stakes are set high from the very beginning. This allows one no time to be distracted. You have Loki who is a constant threat; weather manipulated others, or fighting himself. This villain allows the watcher to be on their toes in order to know what he is really doing. He also has a slow developing scheme that becomes steadily more known and dangerous as the plot develops. One of the most interesting things about this movie is the character interactions. These vary from violent and destructive fights, to hysterical jokes. There is Tony Stark (Iron Man), a brilliant business man that is often betrayed as a large, rich child. He knows all technologies and yet, pokes and jabs at Bruce Banner to see if it will release the Hulk. Bruce Banner who is very seemingly calm at all times has as stark puts it, a big green rage monster waiting to come out. Yet he has his secret of keeping the Hulk under control. He is angry all the time. You have the super soldier that is very lost in a modern day society. An alien named Thor who blames himself for bringing this whole situation upon the earth. Then last but not least, Black Widow who you never know what she is going to do. As great as the Avengers is, it does have its flaws. If one does not know the characters nor seen the movies leading up to the Avengers, they don't know much about them. In the movie they are all already developed giving someone very little room to learn who they all are. Most of this movie is one action seen into the next leaving little time to add to the plot in between. Next to these few flaws, the Avengers is a fantastic film that takes many extraordinary fictional people and makes them feel real as the person sitting next you.",9,1,4,19 November 2012
