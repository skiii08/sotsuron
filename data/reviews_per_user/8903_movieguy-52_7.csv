The Blair Witch Project," The Lamest Movie I Have Ever Seen
","If you actually thought this movie was scary, you really need to get out more. If a pile of rocks can scare the hell out of you, then you better not watch any old episodes of Casper the Friendly Ghost, that might scare the hell out of you as well.If you've ever been scared of the Woods or Witches, this Movie Will Cure You ! I can't believe how many people actually found this movie to be creepy. Your own shadow must scare the hell out of you if you thought this movie was scary. They should of took some of that $30,000 dollars they spent on this movie to invest in a STEADY-SHOT Camcorder, maybe even a Tri-Pod.As for the acting, These kids were just plain annoying. I couldn't wait for them to meet their demise so I could leave the theatre. And if they were really that terrified, would you be able to camp when there's still light out, much less film all the horror going on at the same time ? (F**K NO) I would be running my ass off.This Movie Really Did Suck. Believe the Bad Reviews. They're for real. And why the hell would you call this movie the Blair Witch when you never even get to see the Blair Witch ! Should of been called 'THE THREE STOOGES'
I wouldn't even rent this movie for free !",Null,0,1,31 August 1999
Spider-Man," A++++++ Spiderman Rocks ! Batman - Take notes.....
","Great film. Great story. Great Cast.....Spiderman kicked butt at the box-office. Why ? Because it is actually a good movie.
Batman 3,4,5 and 6 can only wish they came out with a movie like Spiderman. So please, Bat-people, cannn the Bat-sequels....they just Bat-suck !Spiderman had character development and a real story mixed with some cool effects. Granted, the story could of moved a bit faster and CGI fx were a little laughable, but overall, it was one of my favorite movies.Hooray for the producers ! Great Job....now Bat-people, take notes, because THIS IS HOW YOU TURN A COMIC-BOOK INTO A MOVIE. Real people, real stories.....not relying on an all-star hollywood cast to pull your tired script out of the trenches.",Null,0,0,5 August 2002
Seabiscuit," COULD OF BEEN GRREEAT !!! I thought the title was 'Seabiscuit' ? am I wrong ??.....Read this !
","This movie was Good, BUT it could of been GREAT ! My biggest problem with this film :1. Wasted too much time explaining the backgrounds of the men and the depression, and nothing about Seabiscuit for the first hour of the movie. 2. Bored the audience using numerous scenes and film time to explain what a great salesman Howard was. 3. Too many unecessary scenes that should of ended up on the cutting room floor. 4. I don't think we needed to go that FAR BACK or that IN DEPTH into each character's life and heartbreak, expect for Red Pollard's.NOW for what COULD OF MADE this movie GREAT !1. MORE focus on the rise and fall of RED POLLARD. 2. MORE focus on SEABISCUIT....after all, the movie is named after him, isn't it ? It wasn't called 'The Lives of Four Men who struggled their ways out of hardship' which must of been the working title for this film judging from the direction they took. 3. LESS focus on the lives of the men....I mean, did we really have to see what they did day to day ? I think we got the picture in the first five minutes. 4. LESS still shots of the depression....again, we get the picture. 5. A HELL OF A LOT MORE HORSERACING.... 6. MORE INTENSITY IN THE HORSERACING....when the director did get a chance to make up for the boring scenes with the racing action, he completely blew it. Just when the action was starting to make you tingle, he cut too a dining table scene or something boring like that....wtf ??? Give Seabiscuit his due !!! Was the director a War Admiral fan or something ??Finally, to Seabiscuit, what an incredible horse....to Red Pollard, what incredible determination. This film did not give these two the credit they rightfully deserve. I far more enjoyed the A&E special they did on Seabiscuit, and that was FREE.The movie was called 'Seabiscuit' for a reason. It should of been focused around....guess who ? SEABISCUIT....and it's jockey Red Pollard, that's what this film should of been about. Way 2 much focus on characters that should of stayed in the background.",Null,0,0,5 August 2003
Black Hawk Down," Another War Movie....At least it was FREE
","I walked into this movie after watching something else. I have to admit, when Hollywood see's a buzz in War movies, especially after the Sept. 11 incident, they don't hesitate to profit from it....ie, Harts War, Black Hawk Down, A Soldiers Story, Pearl Harbor, Saving Private Ryan.....how many more boring war movies do we have to watch ?Watch Black Hawk Down and you'll see lots of shooting and killing, watch Harts War, you'll see the same thing, watch a Soldiers Story and guess what....I bet you'll see the same thing in that movie too. I wanted to at least give Black Hawk Down a chance to be different, but how can it ? It's a war movie. Go see this movie if you like war movies, it's just getting tiresome seeing the same type of films being dished out over and over just because they will show a guaranteed profit.The sudden string of 'War Movies' being produced by Hollywood this year is similar to the string of 'Medieval Movies' that were produced last year. Knights Tale, Black Knight, The Muskateer, The Three Muskateers, A Mid-Summers Night, Shakespear in Love....should I go on ? Like I said, guaranteed profits.I wonder what's next ? Oh yeah, 'War Movies'. If you want to save 'War Movie Money' watching Black Hawk Down should cover any curiosities you have about any of the other upcoming War Movies coming out. What the heck is it with all these War Movies ? Big name stars, lots of fx, blood, guts, lame love stories added in so your date doesn't totally get bored, same old stuff over and over. Please Hollywood, making profits is fine, but can you also start making decent movies again ?",Null,0,2,9 February 2002
Bring It On," TURN IT OFF !!!
","This movie is reminiscent of She's All That, and the rest of the teen-weenie movies being produced as of late. It is about a bunch of cheerleaders who compete against other cheerleaders and eventually have to square off in the ultimate match where both sides have to.....here it comes.....'Bring it On'Weak script, pathetic characters, I would of gone nuts if I had to go to school with these irritating characters. But as Hollywood expects, kids will flock to see this and think it's great.My final opinion for 'Bring it On', please Hollywood....'TURN IT OFF'",Null,0,1,12 August 2000
A Night at the Roxbury," Funny, Hip, Great Music, Pretty Girls. A++++
","If you have a good sense of humor and like hitting nightclubs then you'll probably enjoy this movie. You'll probably even understand it better.I've read a lot of negative comments from other users, but most of them don't seem like avid club goers. And if you're going to enjoy this movie, like any movie, you're going to have to be able to relate to it in one way or another. Otherwise, you won't find it very appealing. So why would Joe Shmo over in Mississipi find this movie to be boring. Maybe a cow tipping scene would of got his attention.To us over on Hollywood Blvd., It was a gas. Amusing, funny, and enjoyable to watch over and over. After all, that's why you go to the movies, to have a good time, and that's what this movie is, a good time !I'm sick of the sit down and figure the plot out type of movies or the we'll tease you all the way to the end movies. I don't want to go to the movies after a long day at work to sit there and concentrate and have to use my brain to figure out what the directors are trying to accomplish.I like the good old, bonehead, braindead, sidewalk humor films. They're fun to watch. That's why movies are categorized as entertainment although some films tend to look like they should be categorized as psychological and analytical rather than entertainment. Those types of movies just put me to sleep.Go Roxbury ! Go Romy & Michelle !HEY ! Who grabbed my ass ?",Null,1,1,19 August 1999
Rock Star," 'ROCK STAR' #1 Movie of the Year !
","Finally ! A movie WORTH EVERY PENNY ! Definitely the Best Movie I've seen in a long time !!!'Rock Star' had it all, a solid story and extremely well casted actors. Watching the former hip hop rapper 'Marky Mark' deliver one of the finest performances ever as a believable rock star was just a bonus. This movie is what you wish for in more movies. It had a good opening that created the basis for the rest of the movie, then the ending was just as good. I won't spoil it, but the ending of Rock Star won't leave you hanging as so many movies do nowadays. Don't you hate leaving the theatre after a movie p***ed off because the ending sucked and didn't give you closure ? Not here, Rock Star delivers !!! A++++++Don't listen to the critics about this movie. The critics watch soooo many movies, part of their job, that they can no longer distinguish the good movies normal movie goers would like apart from the wierd potboilers they prefer. Critics seem to rant and rave about films that love to bore you, put you to sleep, make your butt hurt in your seat. At Film.com, Rock Star audiences gave it 92% thumbs up, only 8% thumbs down. The critics bashed it and continued to give their cudo's to films that don't interest the majority of the movie going public.Mark Wahlberg should get an emmy for his performance as a 'Rock Star' He was believable the entire time. But of course, they like to give those type of awards to an actor playing a handicap, or a vietnam vet. C'mon Hollywood, give this guy his cudo's !!! Music was also great !!! Bought the CD right after I saw the movie.I've recommended this movie to a lot of people. That's how much I took to this movie. Can't wait to get the DVD and BLAST IT !!! Go see it, you'll love it !!! 5/5*****",Null,1,2,26 October 2001
