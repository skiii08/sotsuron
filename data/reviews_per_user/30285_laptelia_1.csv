The Blair Witch Project," Bad, bad movie!
","I was full of expectations cos I'd heard so much about how great The Blair Witch was - well I was extremely disappointed. The first part of the movie made me want to go asleep.Throughout the whole movie I think I jumped twice. The first time was because I was thinking about something else and the girl started screaming, the second time was at the end.Please do not pay any money to see this movie. If you're bored watch an old re-run of 'Quincy' instead. It'll scare you more.",1,2,4,6 November 1999
