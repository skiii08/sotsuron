Million Dollar Arm," A decent sports flick without being too overly dramatic and over the top
","American sports film and specially with sports like American Football, Baseball are hard to relate to a non American. But some films rise above the sport itself and it becomes more than the sport a human drama perhaps the last film to achieve this was brad pitt's money ball and Jerry McGuire before it.John Ham does justice to the roll of a recruiter trying to get a buck to save his agency and as films go rises above his dreams of fortune to do something greater than that. . If you're looking for an exciting drama which grips you or something that makes you go whoa this is not it and nor does it give you the kick after watching the super bowl. But it definitely is a decent feel good film about a recruiter who gambles to get out of the grunts and the story of two young Indian boys who find their dream which they don't know was there's. Worth a watch on lazy Sunday afternoon.",6,0,0,2 February 2015
The Maze Runner," Another teenage thriller wrapped up in a scifi/fantasy package.
","Distopian future, good looking people with a likable persona, a love interest, the world to save, losing newly made friends along the way, twists and turns only to find out the reality isn't what it seemed.BOOM! Welcome to the Summer block buster of this season and every season for the last decade served with a side of explosions and a cake with not enough layers on it.In a society governed by people whose objective seems logical on a broader scale yet not ethical. But often there is something more selfish behind the what appears to be logical solutions where humans are treated as guinea pigs and the hero questions if the one live sacrificed (usually his love interest) is worth all that and usually ends up saving the girl friend and the world welcome to every dystopia film focused on an teenage audience who wants more something more than the traditional romance or the action flick. Something and I quote 'deeper' , hello call me a sci-fi nerd if you like because I saw all of the 100 million dollar budget sci-fi's with the pretty girl next door persona girls would you guess where oh yes the iMax.It reminds me of a scene from Black BooksBernard: You're going on holiday. You want trash. But you want different kinds of trash. (To female customer) You're a woman, you want social themes, believable characters. (To male customer) You, you want plots, suspense. This'll do you both. Female customer: Hmm... Bernard: (holds up another copy of the book) There's this temp, right? She's 29, she can't get a boyfriend, oh my god. Female customer: Sounds great! Male customer: No, no way. Bernard: And she's got 12 hours to stop nuclear war with China. Male customer: Great.This film is all that is written above and some things more. What I do like about the film is that it has less of a romance that you would expect from others of the same genre which makes it a bit better. Everything else is pretty much the same the chosen one who goes against the rules, breaks them and succeeds. Isn't popular with the older leaders but everyone loves them, because well he is giving them more than the typical good life that they were used to before. Now its exciting there is hope, drama and dead bodies.This group of young adults is stuck in a maze. Where they are there is food, shelter and all you need to survive but they are stuck in a maze run by they don't know who. Are they alien? Are they scientists? Does the world exist as they knew it who knows. Anyways so the maze opens its doors everyday and closes them at night if you don't make it by the night, you're dead what kills you is a mystery.There are different classes, the runners are the Alpha who run the maze memorize it and perhaps find a way out one day. In comes our rebel hero, sacrificing, charming, fast and all. The rest is no mystery.There are some twists and turns and yes they do leave that Chuky is still alive moment at the end. Since its not in cinemas anymore , you can watch it with some folks over if you want to test out the new big speaker that you just acquired.",6,3,5,30 April 2015
Nightcrawler," I love Jake gyllenhaal more with every film that I watch with him in it. This is no exception.
","This is a mood film and can be what you want it to be, its a social commentary about the media giving into ratings and how it forces you to pivot if you want to be in the business. Its a character study of something that can only be characterized as a Entrepreneurial psychopath, if patrick Bateman wasn't in advertising. Lou Bloom, a desperate man ends up as sort of a journalist essentially selling video footage of news around the city the more sensational the better. Its a story about the spiral he gets into going deeper in the rabbit hole and you discover the character as he changes or rather brings out himself in this misadventure. I imagine productivity guru's or self help book writers whose only success is motivational speaking being something like this. Its like someones narrating a marketing, motivational bible and its brilliant.The silence in the film is beautiful and powerful its not a haunting feeling but you get time to absorb it in and just at the right time, the character would break into a beautiful monologue and every monologue levels up the character for you. Think of it as reaching a level boss in a video game and every time its a bigger and cooler looking boss. Its also about relationships and how he Lou Bloom deals with different people in different capacities how compartmentalized he is. From the trailer I imagined it to be much darker but it turned out just brilliant, it goes right in my must see list in the American psycho category.",9,1,1,2 March 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Exactly what you expect and want from a mission impossible film
","I don't go to see mission impossible films to have a moment of contemplation or 'deep thought'. We don't go to see most of these action film series like james bond or sherlock to have a spiritual experience. We go to see these films because they are fun and they deliver a certain quality & taste. Something we've begun to expect from them. This film delivers all the mission impossible fun. Has all the bits from the 'should you choose this mission', 3D mask to infiltrating the uninfiltratable building (gosh that's a major tongue twister), a high speed chase, a hot assassin lady to double crossing agents. I quite like that they stuck with an orchestra and did not random pick popular songs as background music. This isn't a reboot or something different this is same old ethan hawk taking same old ethen hawk gambles.IMF (impossible mission force) has been decommissioned and ethan has to go alone rogue to take down the syndicate. They are recruiting the best of the best to get a new world order going, starts from veinna, jumps to morocco and finally London. And my gosh morocco looks just like rawalpindi. I quite enjoyed it a solid 7/10",7,1,4,2 August 2015
Prisoners," Denis Villeneuve is a cruel man without a single forgiving bone in his body
","You need to plan our Denis Villeneuve's films, be in a good mood be alright if you go in late the next day at work because you were up all night wondering what the hell just did you experience.You keep on clinching on to your chair the whole time because there is no other way to watch a Denis Villeneuve. They are hard to watch not for the squeamish at all but at the same time one of the most memorable experiences in cinema of the last decade. Prisoners is no exception I cannot say for sure if you will be able to watch any of his films the second time but I can assure you they will stick with you and be memorable.This is taking revenge thrillers up a notch and the pacing is beautiful the puzzles fall into place never before time just at the right moment. But you forget the puzzle at times and just want to stop feeling what's going on through your body while watching it.The story revolves around the kidnapping of two little girls and the struggle of the parents to find them to get them home safely with the help of the detective (jake) . That is pretty much what you need to go with watching the film. Jake after zodiac gives his most memorable performance and a moment doesn't go buy when you don't understand Jackman's pain. A must watch for cinema lovers with a less squeamish heart.",9,1,2,29 January 2015
