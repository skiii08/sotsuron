United 93," The most nervous I have been during any movie I have ever seen.
","I'm not a great writer so this isn't going to be one of the more elegant movie reviews you have ever read but after seeing the movie I had to comment on it. Unless you've been in a coma the last 5 years you already know about 9-11 and what happened but that did not deter from the story that was told. The precise documentary style and factual approach was excellent. I was so nervous during the whole movie. On the edge of my seat, heart pounding, picturing myself in their situation. I thought the guy who played himself, the head of the FAA, was awesome. I didn't know until afterward that he wasn't an actor. He was great, I actually thought he had an Oscar worthy performance. I have never had such a feeling during or after a movie as I had with this one. After watching it, I was like 'wow, those people were so brave, such heroes.' Later that night, on Larry King Live, they had 4 family members of the victims on and they wholeheartedly agreed with the facts of the movie and gave kudos to the actors that played their fallen loved ones. They also said that 10% of the opening week gross is going toward a memorial in Pensylvania where the plane went down. I am so glad that they approved of the movie, it was pretty graphic and I was wondering if they would be upset about that. I am going to see this at least one more time this week and I hope that this movie wins an Academy award for best picture and best director at the minimum. Every American should see this movie movie at one point or another, it was simply amazing.",10,3,12,30 April 2006
The Departed," Definitely worth the $8.50
","Although I hate actors that speak their mind publicly about politics and other things in which they have no expertise. Normally I wouldn't see a movie where Alec Baldwin or especially Martin Sheen were involved, however, since Scorsese directs masterpieces (more often than not), I paid to see this movie. I wasn't disappointed in the least bit for the most part. DiCaprio may finally get an Oscar win for this one. Matt Damon was spectacular as well. Jack Nicholson was in rare form in this one. Things that maybe weren't meant to be funny were to me. He was a riot. I actually thought Walhberg did a good job as well where I wasn't a huge fan of his acting ability beforehand (except in Boogie Nights). I probably would have voted this movie a '10' if the ending wasn't disappointing. I felt shocked when DiCaprio's character got blown away at the end. I am sentimental I guess, I liked his character and thought he put more on the line to stop crime and bring down a madman than 99.9% of us would do. I think it may have been a better ending if Wahlberg's character showed up at the elevator to blow Matt Damon and the other guy away and save Costigan (DiCaprio). Having said that, I realize that the ending was a wakeup call to illustrate that not all great cops have a happy ending. I think the movie is a sure fire Oscar nominee for best picture, as well as Scorsese for Director, DiCaprio for best actor (or supporting actor if they decide he wasn't the mian guy), and possibly Matt Damon as best actor/ supporting actor.",9,0,2,12 October 2006
Gangs of New York," Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible as Bill 'The Butcher'
","If Daniel Day-Lewis isn't the best actor alive, then he is definately in the top 3.  His performance as Bill 'The Butcher' was excellent.  His accent was very believable and his presence was utterly chilling.  I can't think of one actor who could have played that role better.  It's ashame that he doesn't work that much anymore.  Its an even worse shame that he did not win the Academy Award for that role.  Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was pretty good but nothing to write home about. John C. Riley's short role was a very good one.  He has proved why he is one of the most sought after charachter actors today.  The movie was pretty good overall, the acting was excellent for the most part.  I'd have to give it a solid '8' out of '10'.",Null,0,1,10 April 2004
True Romance," An incredible movie filled with top notch cameos of today's hottest actors.
","True Romance is my favorite movie of all time.  The story is compelling. The acting is exquisite.  The dialogue is what takes it to another level. The movie is funny in a weird way because of the dialogue.  Gary Oldman should have been nominated for best supporting actor if his role had been a little bit bigger.  Then again, you could say that about Christopher Walken's performance also.  The scene between Walken and Dennis Hopper was absolutely awesome!  Gary Oldman amazes me in every role he portrays.  An English actor that is able to 'nail' that 'wannabe' accent that Drexl has is just incredible.  It is a very violent movie but it was violent for the sake of being violent.  It was necessary to understand the charachters and their definition of 'True Romance'.  James Gandolfini shows his brilliance in portraying a mobster strongman which no doubt lead to his casting in The Sopranos.  Tom Sizemore and Chris Penn add interesting dialogue that I particularly found funny.  Even Bronson Pinchot had a good part in this flick.  Saul Rubinek was excellent in portraying fat cat movie producer Lee Donowitz. The Bottom line:  Great short performances out of Oldman, Walken, Hopper, Rubinek,Gandolfini and solid short performances out of Michael Rappaport, Tom Sizemore, Chris Penn,Bronson Pinchot, Val Kilmer and Brad Pitt.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette provide their best performances as the two main charachters who define 'True Romance' a little differently than the rest of us.  I think the title of the movie threw off mainstream America and mislead them to believe it was a 'romance' in the traditional sense.",10,0,1,28 October 2002
