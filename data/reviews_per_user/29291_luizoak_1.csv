Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," It's a hoax. It's not Sherlock Holmes. More like Batman
","The character sometimes talks like Sherlock, but fights like a damn Bruce Lee, shoots like freaking Rambo and has a lot of Jack Sparrow in his humoristic backbone. Absurdly nothing like what's in the books. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle must be weeping in his grave by now. If you have a contrary view, then follow up your disagreement by first reading ONE of the books.The director seems to have it confused with Batman; I would not be surprised if he actually had some sort of Sherlock-Belt along with a baseball bat. The detective role he should play in this movie is replaced by a vicious brawler breaking bones and performing dazzling acrobatic moves. It's fun, it's well edited, but it is NOT Sherlock Holmes.",2,12,23,28 April 2012
