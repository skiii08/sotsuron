Catch Me If You Can," A fun ride the whole way through!
","Leo created the perfect character for Mr. Abagnale and it was wonderful to see all the crazy things he pulled off. Most of the time when I was watching this movie and Leo executed some incredible action I couldn't help but smile and say 'No way!' I'd highly recommend this movie to any looking to have a great time watching an excellent film from the marvelous Mr. Spielberg. Christopher Walken did a superb job as the father, he's not the traditional mentor and it works extremely well in this movie.Tom Hanks does a marvelous job portraying the agent trying to catch Abagnale and his mind games work perfectly through every scene. His darker sense of tone works against the light hearted Abagnale. Leo is one of my favorite actors and this just amplified my belief in him. He is so charismatic in every role and this one is no different. Not much else to say, it's Leonardo DiCaprio!",9,2,3,10 July 2017
