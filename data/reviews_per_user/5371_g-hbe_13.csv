Frost_Nixon," Powerful, entertaining and finally affectionate.
","We've had this DVD resting on the shelf for years, but somehow never got around to watching it together. While my wife was away recently, I took the opportunity to give it a good viewing with a few whiskies and snacks.
Wow, am I glad I did. Superb performances from everyone, not a wooden showing from any of the actors. Michael Sheen looks the part and, although his 'Frost voice' is variable from scene to scene, at its best it could pass for the man himself, a very accurate impression.
(spoilers follow) The ending is thrilling. Nixon, egged on by clever questioning from Frost, makes a kind of resigned confession and seems glad to get it out. From that point, Nixon realises he is no longer the political figure he was and Frost cements his reputation. The final scenes are quite affecting and I found myself a little misty-eyed. Given a decent interval, I could easily watch this again.",9,0,0,16 December 2018
Captain Phillips," Slow start, perfect film.
","It's not often I give a film 10 marks (especially an actioner), but this one is worth every penny. Tom Hanks is perfect as the Captain, who we learn is methodical and thorough, and cares about doing things right. The early dialogue with his wife and his crew show him to be quiet but firm and respectful. Hanks plays this with fine focus. (SPOILERS NOW) There's a lot of business on board (including an emergency drill involving pirates) before the real deal turns up, and then the film shifts gear and gathers speed. Director Greengrass controls this to a tee, never letting the tension slacken for a second. The rescue/climax when it comes is electrifying, so tense and emotional (my wife said I looked awe-struck) that I was on the edge of my seat. As for the final scene in the medical bay, it had me weeping. The Captain's fragile mental state and the quiet dedication of the medics was very touching, and when Phillips distractedly thanks the doctor and she responds with a gentle 'you're welcome', I thought I would start bawling out loud. The second time he thanks her she gives the same gentle response and gee, I just let go. What a film. Thanks to all involved.",10,0,3,8 May 2014
Ready Player One," Fast & fun, but lacking heart.
","There's a lot of hype surrounding this film and when we saw it come up on a streaming service we decided to give it a go. It was only at the end that I realised the reason for my lack of satisfaction - it's a kids' film. Packed with fast-paced action, massive, noisy set-pieces, giant robots and gibbering jargon it assaults the senses almost without a pause, but sadly the story is wafer-thin and there's little of the superb 'family feeling' that we normally see in Spielberg movies.
There are a few good references to older films and classic computer games but let's face it, anyone can do that. So, impressive as the spectacle is (the CGI is quite something), ultimately for me it is a 'one time only' movie, never to be watched again. I have been a Spielberg fan since the days of Duel and Jaws, but he's slipped up with this one.",7,1,3,22 September 2018
Interstellar," A potentially great film but.....
","...ruined by almost indecipherable speech, especially on the part of Cooper. We chose this film as it had received good reviews and we like a good science fiction film, but within the first ten minutes we knew we were in for a 'what did he say' -fest. The actor playing Cooper had such mumbled, lazy diction and spoke in a semi whisper it was almost impossible to understand anything he said. About an hour in we almost decided to give up and watch an old 60's Doris Day & Rock Hudson comedy instead - at least you can hear every word clear as a bell. But we struggled through all 2.5 hours of it and came out the other end none the wiser.
Do they go somewhere to learn how to mangle their speech? Or maybe they have their jaws wired?",4,5,8,27 May 2018
American Hustle," Quite an experience.
","I'd heard lots about this film but never seen it until it popped up on TV the other night. The plot (such as it was) sounded intriguing, so we cracked a bottle of wine and settled down to watch. It quickly sucked us in, but we had great difficulty following the dialogue due to some of the actors gabbling and mumbling their lines. My wife nodded off, but I decided to stay with it for the sheer spectacle and drama as the set-pieces and the music came together to make an almost hypnotic experience. Incredible, and at the end of the picture I was so wound up by the experience that I woke up my wife to tell her she'd missed a real treat. I'd give it 10, but the difficulties with the incomprehensible dialogue mark it down. It may be an English/American thing.",8,1,3,7 March 2016
The Village," Captivating
","Despite what the marketing men might have you believe, this is NOT a horror film. Like Shyamalan's other movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Sixth Sense', this is a story with a deep vein of melancholy. Some scenes are done with very little (if any) dialogue and just a couple of actors speaking whole stories with nothing but looks and tiny gestures, and the effect (as in the breakfast scene in Unbreakable) can be shattering. Reviewers here who have said things like 'this story of a village being scared of monsters outside is so childish/crude/predictable...' must have stopped watching after the first half hour or have no idea of subtlety. The story itself cleverly moves from a fairly standard scary tale to an unsettling story of despair and hope, and the uplifting ending is enough to put a further twist on our already stretched emotions. Shyamalan is very adept at getting small but extremely moving performances out of his actors, and once again it is this subtlety that (for me) is so effective.SPOILER FOLLOWS: A beautiful film - even the 'monsters' (which of course turn out to be anything but...) have a beauty about them, with their bright red cloaks and the spines. It's a love story, not a horror film.",8,0,0,29 August 2006
Mulholland Drive," nonsensical, pretentious rambling non-story.
","Well, there's a couple of hours wasted. I never learn my lesson, I keep expecting David Lynch to make understandable crime/thrillers, but he always does the same thing - he makes a good start with an intriguing premise but then can't resist loading it up with dreams, altered reality and out-and-out barminess. We decided to watch this after seeing a TV review of it, and the 'strange blue key' had us wondering if it might be worth a watch. And it was, up to about half way through when Lynch started messing it all about. And who the heck was 'The Cowboy' and what was he there for, what purpose did he serve? Nah, Lynch just makes it up as he goes along, safe in the knowledge that his fans will lap it up and pretend to get it. We gave up even trying to follow it in the second hour. We were also thinking about 'Lost Highway', but reading the resume of that film it seems to suffer from the same thing. Never again, I'll give Lynch a wide berth from now on. I gave it three points because of the nice photography.",3,2,6,24 July 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Absolute junk.
","I had to endure this steaming pile of mess last night and I thought I'd die before it finished. It's an unoriginal story, very badly written directed. It seems to consist of various unidentified characters going from one unexplained set-piece to the next without giving the viewer any idea of why. It replaces imagination and plot with animation and computer graphics. It meant nothing at all and I just couldn't whip up any reaction to it except irritation. Oh, and why did most of it take place in the  dark? If this is what is regarded as a good film these days, God help us.",1,0,2,14 March 2020
Super 8," Good, but somehow disappointing.
","We'd heard good things about this film so finally decided to buy it. With names like JJ Abrams and S.Spielberg in the credits, it had to be worth a look. The story concerns a group of school-friends from rather difficult family backgrounds who are making a small 8mm film about zombies. During the filming of one scene, a train de-rails and crashes spectacularly right around them (this sequence is incredibly powerful)and they barely get away with their lives. Then strange things begin to happen.... It's all good so far, and we had great fun spotting the references to Close encounters, ET and of course the mentions of 'Romero'. (SPOILERS FROM HERE) But the end of the film, when the alien creature finally completes its spaceship and leaves is glossed over very quickly and I failed to see just how the kids were in any way involved. Yes, the experience was unifying for the kids and their parents and as a kind of coming-of-age saga it works well, but the alien thread really was excess baggage. And (I may have blinked) what were the cubes for? I so wanted this to be a great film that I could watch over again, but somehow I think it'll sit on the shelf, and that's a shame.",7,0,1,7 September 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," Treasure every frame
","This film has everything going for it: A director with an unshakeable optimism and faith in human nature, a wonderful clutch of players (headed by the sure-footed James Stewart), and a great story. Synopsis: As the film begins, we see Bedford Falls through falling snow and hear the quiet prayers of the locals. They are praying for George Bailey, who is in trouble. We hear the Angels considering what action to take as George contemplates ending his life. They summon a rookie Angel - Clarence - and look at George's life. *SPOILERS APLENTY* George Bailey is a likable young man who wants to leave Bedford Falls and make his name, but every time he tries to get away something holds him back. His father owns and runs the local Building Society, which helps the poor of the area get on the housing ladder and is warm-hearted and generous to his clients. His nemesis is Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore), head of the local bank, who runs a hard bargain and keeps *his* mortgagees in the dirt. After George's father dies suddenly, he finds himself running the Building & Loan, unwilling to allow it to collapse and put the townspeople in hock to Potter. Time passes and George is to marry childhood sweetheart Mary (lovely Donna Reed), but then absent-minded Uncle Billy loses $8000 and it falls into the hands of Potter - and this on the eve of a bank inspection. At his wit's end, George pleads with Potter for help, but the price (all George's clients being passed to the evil Potter) is something he cannot stomach. He walks out into the night and has a drink at the local bar where he prays under his breath, asking God to get him through somehow. All he gets is a fat lip from the husband of a local teacher whom he has upset. Things can't get any worse for George, and he makes his way to the river bridge with the intention of jumping off. We are now up-to-date. Director Frank Capra has spent half the film, if not more - carefully laying out his characters: George, Mary, Potter, Uncle Billy, Bert & Ernie. We have also had a heart-rending scene showing the local drug-store owner's anguish at the loss of his son and the almost tragic consequences of his grief. We know these people - we know that George is an ambitious man who decides his own happiness must take second place behind that of his friends and clients. We know Uncle Billy has had trouble with the bottle and shouldn't really be helping run the Building & Loan. And we know that Potter hasn't a decent bone in his body - the only thing that matters to him is money, and getting his hands on the expanding Baily empire. Capra has made us care. George jumps in the freezing river and prepares for death, but now the *real* story begins! Clarence the Rookie Angel jumps in at the same time and makes a big fuss about drowning - and George being George swims over to him and drags him out. After some 'double-take' comedy as they dry out in the keeper's hut, Clarence listens to George saying he thinks the town would've been better off if he hadn't been born. This gives Clarence an idea - he decides to show just what would have become of Bedford Falls and its people if George hadn't been around. The snow stops falling. It's an awful place, dominated by Potter's bank and seedy clubs. The people of Pottersville (as it is now known) are miserable and mean, and even his mother is a cold-hearted land-lady. The small acts of kindness and generosity that George did now never happened. As they visit the graveyard, George desperately asks Clarence 'What's happened to Mary?' This is somehow the emotional hub of the film, as Clarence shouts over the wind 'You won't like this George, she's an OLD MAID, she never married!' Forcing Clarence to reveal her whereabouts, George finds her and pleads with her to recognise him, but of course she doesn't - he was never born. It is in this scene that the whole ghastly truth hits George. The emotional punch is terrible, both for George and the audience. Neither he nor we can take any more and back at the bridge he pleads with God to put things back as they should be. He wants to live. He wants his friends back, and it doesn't matter about the money. It begins to snow again. George races home and finds the whole town - all except old Potter - has been desperately worried about him, and the story about the missing money has spread. They realise that without George, without his tireless efforts and his repeated sacrifices, their lives would be infinitely poorer. As George hugs and kisses Mary and the kids, a few friends turn up, bringing with them the few dollars they can spare. Soon, the house is full of his friends and customers and the money begins to come thick and fast. His younger brother - whose life he saved in childhood - turns up having just arrived home from active service and an old schoolfriend wires him cash from abroad. George is back in the bosom of his family, and realises that no man is ever poor if he has friends. THE END. Sorry to take so long almost setting out the entire screenplay, but this is one film about which enough can never be said. The depth and warmth of the characters, the naturalistic acting of Stewart and his carefully-chosen cast, the roller-coaster ride of emotions and the importance of the message (which is delivered all the way through, not just at the end), come together to make the finest, most satisfying and most deeply moving film of all time. It really *is* a wonderful life, and may this film always remind us so.",10,1,5,31 August 2006
Arrival," A nice slow burn...to nowhere.
","We thought this sounded interesting so we streamed it via Amazon. It got off to a good start by keeping the pace slow while introducing us to the main character and what makes her tick. All good films spend time doing this, rather than jumping straight into a screenful of CGI explosions and wrecks.The intrigue built as we saw the mysterious ships and then their occupants with which our hero must communicate to see why they are here. Sadly, the story gets a bit up itself at this point, with memories of her dead child intruding (for no good reason as far I could see) and see rather too many visits to the 'interview room' on board the spacecraft as the aliens' language is (kind of) revealed. The denouement (such as it is) comes when it turns out the scientists have mistaken the word 'language' for 'weapon' (like you tend to do) and the whole global panic was for nothing. End of movie, cue a load of sentimental babble, roll the credits. Thank the Lord it cost us nothing extra. One more point - will someone PLEASE tell young American actors to stop whispering and slurring? I missed a lot of Amy Adams' dialogue because of it.",4,2,4,13 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," These are the droids we are looking for!
","We have always loved the original STAR WARS (A new hope) and the two follow up films, but thought this new one might be a disappointment. How wrong we were! From the moment the famous Star Wars fanfare comes crashing from the speakers and the iconic text rolls up the screen, we were hooked. What a treat to see Harrison Ford playing an ageing Han Solo and Carrie Fisher all mumsy as the Princess. Nice too to know that Anthony Daniels was still inside C3PO (although he isn't given much to do) and Peter Mayhew was bravely once again wearing 'the rug' despite his ill-health. No sign of Luke (Mark Hamil) or R2D2 for most of the time, but there are two gratifying reveals late in the film. R2D2's place in this story is taken by a spherical droid called BB8 who is cute and rolls around squeaking and bleeping. As for the story, it's basically 'fight off the baddies while trying to find Luke'. But who cares about the story - this is basically a nostalgia movie for those of us of a certain age. Plenty of fascinating extras too. These are not the droids you are looking for.......",9,3,21,12 May 2016
Happy Feet," A by-the-numbers disaster.
","I watched this on DVD a few days ago, and quite frankly I couldn't believe how poor it was. It's a mess! It looks like it was assembled from left-overs from 'Ice Age' or even mistakenly edited-together bits from the cutting-room floor. It just doesn't flow, and I found myself quietly seething when YET ANOTHER song 'n' dance routine started up, getting in the way of the plot - well, I *think* it was a plot? The reason I'm not sure about the story is that I had great difficulty understanding the dialogue. It was indistinct and often very 'mumbly'. I honestly couldn't tell what the characters were saying! Finally, can we *please* see an end to these films which attempt to plant politically-correct ideas in our children's' heads? It's getting very wearisome now. Maybee I'm getting grouchy in my middle age, but I much prefer an old-fashioned Disney cartoon!",2,2,4,4 April 2007
