Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," I'm going to really mad if this does better than Battleship or John Carter
","I always try and give movies the extra consideration for artistic contributions. Which is why I was surprised that John Carter and Battleship actually turned out to be duds. But this movie is really kind of a lemon. I mean, come on...vampires....and Abraham Lincoln. I'm sure the book was interesting and entertaining (as most books are always better than the movie). But it just seems that this movie is just trying to ride the coattails of this vampire craze gripping the country. The Twilight series as officially played this genre out for me.I give the special effects a good nod (with the exception of Lincoln's 'aged' look), but the overall plot is ridiculous at best.Wait until this movie hits the dollar theater or the Red Box. Don't blow premium movie ticket and concession money on this dud. I'd rather wait for the sequel: 'George W Bush...Smart Person Hunter'",5,3,7,24 June 2012
