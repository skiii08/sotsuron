Ford v Ferrari," Ford Sucks
",Loved the movie. Very fast paced and enjoyable start to finish. I love the Mustang but after seeing the Ford leadership I would definitely have second thoughts about owning their products. Matt Damian's performance is very believable. Great story,9,0,3,24 March 2020
Knives Out," Throwback Mystery
","Very well done. Acting was superb. Would watch again. The condition of the theater was my only complaint (AMC in Voorhees, NJ) very dirty and misconceived seating that was assigned in advance. No never attained there again.Again, the movie was great and I thought the respect of the audience intelligence was maintained.",8,0,2,12 January 2020
The Irishman," Entertaining
",Upon my first viewing I thought it was a very entertaining and exciting film. But when I further analyzed it did have some flaws. Character development was kind of weak. I expected more from the main character as to why he chose a life of crime. It did talk about the after ramifications to him and his family but very little on why.I did love the drama and meeting of all the different characters. To me the 3.5 hours were at the onset were daunting and it seemed to keep my interest throughout. Not sure if I would watch it again though.,8,2,5,20 March 2020
BlacKkKlansman," Mildly entertaining but very flawed
",This movie kept me interested but then quickly deteriorated into a polical hit job against Trump. The film featured an overlay of 1970s history with modern day politics and became a joke of a production. It was a lame attempt to demonize the Trump wave that captured the conservative support with radical ideals and events from over 50 years ago. Will the left and Hollywood ever acknowledge that they lost the 2016 presidential election.,3,9,23,8 September 2018
1917," Excellent acting
",I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. Realistic (I think) account of the horrors of war. Old style back and forth ground fights with little respect for human life. The acting was very realistic and had me hanging with every scene. Major subliminal messages that provokes the mind for those interested but also entertaining for those that aren't.,9,8,12,19 January 2020
Godzilla," Horrible!
","This movie is the worst piece of trash that I've seen in a while.. No plot whatsoever! Special effects were OK. I was bored and drifting off to sleep 45 minutes into the movie. Hide your kids, hide your wife this movie sucked! This movie had so much potential but never got going. I was totally in a state of confusion.The original (1954) was much better. Better acting, it had a plot!I blame myself for taking the chance and going to see this movie in the first place.The general masses will go to see this movie and be disappointed.",1,28,59,24 May 2014
