First Man," Stunning
","This movie told Armstrong's journey deeply. While you're watch the full history of 'one small step', you also understand a father's a husband's feelings. There are no dialogues in some scenes but tells a lot of thing about feelings.",10,1,3,28 October 2018
Toy Story 4," Worth the wait
","I guess until a 'new' Toy Story movie, that's the best animation film ever. It's hilarious as it is emotional like always. Go and see!",10,1,3,23 June 2019
Joker," This is it.
","This is the one that we missed for a long time. Joaquin's Joker is far more realistic then the rest of others. Directing and writing was brilliant, and colors of course.
We see a real man, from the real life, not a fictional universe. We always know Joker as a 'explosive' identity and now, we know how-what is it about. Thank you for such a great experience.",10,4,8,10 October 2019
