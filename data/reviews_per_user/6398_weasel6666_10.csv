Alien 3," maybe the worst in the alien saga
","this is maybe the worst movie of the alien saga, but is still a good movie to watch. it's not the that is bad, is the others (alien movies) that are better. sigourney weaver continues her great performance as ripley in one more alien movie, i can't even imagine other actress for the job. charles dutton was a surprise for me in this movie, for is good performance. if u are an alien fan go see it. if u like bold women go see it. if not, don't see it.",Null,9,14,6 December 2000
Mulan," the story of mulan
","mulan is not the usually disney story about love and tenderness, no this movie is about honour, and doing what you must for achieving it, and if you fall in love in the middle there's no biggie. this movie tells us the true story of mulan, a chinese daughter that takes her father's place in the army because her father is to old for fighting. but that is not the only reason, she also wants to prove to herself that she is good at something, achieving honour to her and to her familly. once again walt disney scores, turning a truthful story in to a magic and beautiful animated movie. the animated movie is good, but could be better, but who cares, this movie isn't about the animation, is it about the spirit of it, it's about about the honour and achieveness of that honour. and you know what? it works, it works just fine, making mulan one of the greatest animated feature of walt disney",Null,0,1,27 November 2000
Alien: Resurrection," ripley returns... from the dead
","alien: resurrection is the last of the alien series (so far...), and it is not the greatest movie of the saga, but isn't also the worst. for me the best is the second movie and the worst is the third movie. the movie has all the elements of the alien saga, it has fear, suspense and gore. the alien looks more alive, we can now see his breath. sigourney weaver as the eternal ripley does a fantastic job (puts linda hamilton in a pocket). and as weaver side-kick we have winona ryder, that is kind a new in this type of movie (except for her performance in dracula) does a nice job. the screen write was in charge of joss whedon, the creator of buffy the vampire slayer, giving a nice rhythm to the action of the movie. in short this is movie that all the fans of the alien saga should see. also all the fans of sci-fi and gore can't miss this. all the others, watch other movie.",Null,0,0,15 January 2001
Alien," the alien saga begins
","alien is already a classic and it's for many the best sci-fi movie of all times. i think he has only one opponent: star wars. Ridley Scott made this movie in 1979, and he created one of the scariests monsters in the history of movies, the alien. a monster that has acid for blood and a double mouth. he also give birth to sigourney weaver (the eternal ripley) who becames a star in this movie. we can also see tom skerrit in this movie, giving us a good performance. scenario in this movie is claustrophobic and the soundtrack is great. in short this is a must see for all sci-fi lovers. all the others that are not fans of sci-fi i'll give three reasons why you should see this movie: it has ridley scott print all over it, it has sigourney weaver first debut and it has the alien. for all the alien fans... do i really have to point out the reasons? watch it all over again just because you need to.",Null,0,1,27 November 2000
Armageddon," the blockbuster of the year
","like a great blockbuster it has everything. action, special effects, tears and laughter. great actors like bruce willis, liv tyler, ben affleck and steve buscemi (the man is hilarious, playing weasel's roles). forget the logic and listen to your heart. don't think about the movie, watch it. in a blockbuster the mind is not important, what's important is that stimulates our five senses, and it does beautifully. it also has a great music score. in short this is a must see for everyone who likes movies.",Null,2,3,6 December 2000
Aliens," the best movie of the alien saga
","james cameron makes the best movie of the alien saga with aliens. he combines the horror and suspense with frenetic breath taking action. the genres of sci-fi, action feature and horror come together in this fabulous rollercoaster. the eternal ripley is at her best, sigourney weaver gives a very linda hamilton performance, full of action. this movie also introduces a new character newt, that is the most sweet character that i ever saw on screen, revealing the maternal side of ripley. aliens has also, a fantastic supporting cast, with performances of michael biehn, lance henrikson, paul reiser and bill paxton. in short, all alien's fan should see this, and for those who aren't an alien fan, if you enjoy riding the rollercoaster watch this movie if you prefer the merry go round don't watch it",Null,0,0,4 December 2000
The Exorcist," perhaps the most scariest movie ever made
","this is perhaps one of the scariest movie ever made, and it's definitely in the horror classics the best one ever made, right along with carrie. it has a marvelous story, of possession and exorcism, and my friends what an exorcism, an epic scene. the exorcist of sir william peter blatty it's just the best novel that i ever read, and william friedkin does a great job in putting the novel on screen. also, Linda Blair does a fantastic job as regan, the possessed girl successes in being disgusting, scary and pityful at the same time, and that my friends, it's a great performance. very nominated by the academy, this is definitely a great film, and great classic, but it's not for anyone, 'coz believe me, when i say that this movie makes ur stomach turn and it will scare the living s*** out of u. but if are not very impressible, then u HAVE to see this, coz it's a horror 'work of art' of a movie.",Null,0,1,7 April 2001
Scream 2," the best of sequels
","'in a final analysis all sequels sucks' randy would say, and in generally he is right, but in this movie he is not. this is maybe the greatest sequel ever put on screen. it continues the story of the first movie and does the same connection, that the first movie did, to other scary movies. pointing out an interesting opinion about sequels. it has the same element of the 'who is the killer?', u r on for a treat in the end. it's full of scares and has more gore, like a sequel should have. wes craven does what he does best, horror. the argument by kevin williamson is still superb. and the cast with neve campbell, courtney cox, david arquette, jamie kennedy, liev shreiber and sarah michelle gellar (that's right the vampire slayer, my dear buffy) create a great cast. in short this is a must see for everyone, except those who don't like gore, 'coz it's only the best sequel ever made.",Null,0,0,4 December 2000
Scream," scream is a not a scary movie, it's a movie about scary movies
","scream is not a typical scary movie, it's a movie about scary movies and that makes scream even more scary. the first time that i saw that movie i didn't like it, because i thought it's just one more scary movie, but after i saw scream 2 i found out that i was wrong. i put the two movies together and saw them as one all and it was then that stroke me that the story was excellent because it gives you a story about scary movies and other movies, in such way that makes it plausible that what happen in the movie could happen in the real life. also it was as scary as hell, having also the element of the 'who is the killer?' that is very well worked in this movie, you are gonna have a big surprise at the end. wes craven prove once more that he is a genious in horror movies, the argument by kevin williamson is very good and has a great cast with performances of neve campbell, david arquette, courtney cox, skeet ullrich, jamie kennedy and drew barrymore. in short is one of best movies that i ever saw on screen, it's very good and very scary, and most of all is not brainless like most of the horror movies genre.",Null,0,0,2 November 2000
Carrie," the best of the best in horror films
","carrie is just the best horror movie when you look to all the classic horror movies, having only one other opponent, the exorcist. Brian De Palma who is not a master in the horror universe, give us the most frightening movie ever made, 'coz he makes the characters humans, making us care about them, especially the shy little girl named Carrie, and then the horror strikes, it strikes like a thunder, brutal and quick, and we can see the path of destruction that the horror has made. This movie has many scares and it has one that is, for me,the scariest scare of the history of horror movies. The story is so good that we could only guess it who wrote it, that's right, the master Stephen King, one more box-office novel... The cast is great, especially Sissy Spacek as Carrie and Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother. Also look close and you may see John Travolta and Nancy Allen. In short this is a cult film, a must see for all horror fans 'coz it's one of the best horror film that was ever made and 'coz it's absolutely the scariest movie ever put on screen.",Null,0,0,13 November 2000
