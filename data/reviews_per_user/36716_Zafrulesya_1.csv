Lucky Number Slevin," Brilliant action packed thriller
","A true masterclass. Brilliant performance form Hartnett, Lui, Willis and as always Freeman and Kingsley. Its hard to imagine at times that this was brilliantly played by Josh Hartnett and Lucy Lui, interestingly changing her character to a lovable-bubbly type of girl than most of the cold-bitched up type characters she usually does.This film is intriguing in its own world filled with a breathtaking script that leaves you wonder how this ain't one of the greatest films ever made. I am not gonna give anything away, because I strongly recommend you to watch this, if not own it on DVD (what the hell are you waiting for!!!)A MUST SEE",9,1,3,30 May 2007
