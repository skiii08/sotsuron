It," 'It' can frighten your little kids :/
","Not really scary movie! But not bad, too.If someone chooses to watch a mild horror with their kids; yeah, it can make the kids to scream a bit for some scenes! but actually there should be no horror movies for kids indeed!
So for an adult, nothing to fear of course! Just a story which is trying to frighten you somehow but it fails sadly...Pennywise is considered as a bad character to frighten the weak minded children(in the movie as we see, I don't know about him in story)but in that scene which all kids try to defeat him unitedly with only powerful words; it shows you that yes, you're right, you've came to a wrong! that wasn't a movie you were looking for...!",3,2,3,18 August 2019
The Irishman," Feel 1990s movies in 2019!
","I really loved it! Although it goes slowly and smoothly whole the movie and in may not be attractive to new generations somehow, but still, how you could not love it?! (As I'm a new generation,too) The end of the movie and the loneliness which would come to all of us one day, no matter what we've done whole our live is really touching...
however, it's clear as daytime that these kinda movies may not seem impressive to everyone when you see that no any exciting and breathtaking scenes are there. but hey, take it easy about it, this is its own kind and well, to me, it was impressive!
But as criticism to be honest, there are something which may bother you somehow in cases like those few scenes when the screen gets lost for a sec because of changing angels and such, mostly when Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino) speaks with phone or something( I don't know if anyone focused on that or not), or you may get confused about the names, cause there're lots of names with different roles which the movie will not introduce them to you and so you have to make a mapping in your mind to see the contracts and connections but totally, that's not much of concern, that's easy if you follow the story whole the time...
And at last, I should say it seems like you're watching 1990s movies but with a better screen and audio quality and better acting and handling in 2019! That's perfect if it is in your style!",9,5,10,3 December 2019
Aquaman," Only Jason Momoa...! but even he can't make it interesting(to me)
","Just leave it behind... most of us came to watch it because of Jason Momoa, and of course he were perfect and played well but sadly The movie itself is disappointing...I myself wasn't interested in the story and fictional scenes which were too much and really unbelievable even as a fictional one...!!
And even the scene of fighting underwater in a kind of Atlantic Colosseum, when the score board came up! I thought that : hey!! What's really going one?!!! Score board?!! What's the meaning of this?!! Gosh, what am I watching?!!! WWE or something?!!:/",2,2,5,18 August 2019
Shutter Island," It plays with your mind...
","The storyline is great, the movie itself is stunning and Leonardo dicaprio...; what can we say about hime...!! He's perfect!You can watch it again and again and every time you may learn better about how the movie goes one, cause it plays with your mind...",9,0,2,20 August 2019
Interstellar," JUST WATCH IT DEEPLY...!
","Everyone should watch this movie, I mean it!
One of the greatest movies of ever seen.You'll find yourself mind blown at the end and drown in thoughts which gives you an intention to watch it several times again!!",10,0,2,18 August 2019
The Revenant," 'Only watch it'
","A great well made movie with two lovely stars; Leonardo Dicaprio and Tom Hardy...
Of course there are some critics in cases, but they can be overlooked.
The musics are really amazing,too. They're so epic; kind of historical American epic...",10,0,2,18 August 2019
The Favourite," It would be considered as a boring movie...
","The end of the movie was interesting to me, as if we focus on the purpose which the movie was chasing, but the storyline itself goes on slowly and boring in some parts and extra repetition of some routine works of the characters rises up which makes you feel boring about the rest...",5,2,4,18 August 2019
1917," Perfect Non-stop narration of a world war story...
","How amazing it was from the first scene to the end( to me)! There're lots of world war movies out there and many are perfect though, but this one to me and for sure many others till now; was one of the best among all, this kind of non-stop narration that rarely the scenes seem to be changed like it doesn't change at all and the process goes through the end from only one view( I don't know if there's an specific word for this kind or not) makes it a perfect movie that forces you to sit back and follow the story and feel like you're the third person of the scene as a soul beside them and feel everything they do! Maybe others would say: 'oh! Come on, this is not all that!' But it really is for me and the fans maybe. It could feel even better if more action scenes would come across, for sure.
So, Everything was good; it has some faults of course, in some scenes like when Blake was dying and was talking to Schofield and then two soldiers came through, and at the road, vehicles and soldiers were struggling with the trunk, I asked myself how fast it could happen and none of them could hear the voices, I mean that was really fast! It could take longer for all those vehicles to arrive there and spread over that land, so that they wouldn't seem to be acting obviously after the director allows them when the camera came through the road!!
But anyway, totally it's one of the best.
I loved it!",10,17,28,5 February 2020
Midsommar," Good,bad,mad,terrifying at the same time...!
","Well I was just thinking that if there could be two more hours, I would possibly get mad and become suspicious to everyone around myself; totally those whose actions seems to be something out of this planet, which we all had met them at least once...!'Midsommar' might not be a public popular movie as the madness,illness,illusion and such has completely organized its base. It bothers your feelings most of the time, and keeps you in a suspended circumstance which forces you not to have any idea about the next event... really terrific and worth enough to watch it in this case(well,not for madness of course :/ ) But beside them, there are some kinda faults in it... For instance the reason and just the only one for which they didn't leave the village after those elders suiasided, why they kept staying? For what reasonable and logic reason? no any clue! that is just to make the story keeping on! Why would anyone stay in such a madhouse?!
and even the traditions of the village is another hilarious point which was organized just for storyline!! Imagine In an European country, in technology and communication era, there be a secret village with so many strange traditions and for God sake, no one in the world would know about them with their disgusting masacare!!! How possible?!
I know it's only a story organized in a post modern folk horror genre and they have meanings though; but even in this case, these defects are not admirable and they bother you whole the time you're watching!I think the story goes on in a way which it tries to surprise the audiences till end and it does so, as we can see whole the time specially the last scene that it acted like a wildling and ended harshly! but those unforgettable deficiencies and of course the madness of it, feels like you don't like to watch it again or suggest it to anyone else but at the same time you wanna do it,too... :/",5,0,0,23 October 2019
The Shape of Water," Just waste of time...
","You may, indeed sleep while the movie is playing and if you've came to watch a good movie in your resting time after work! there's nothing to encourage you to keep watching till end, as I experienced; at the middle of it, you'll find out ; 'Oh, Gosh! How tedious it is!!' and you want to stop it, but something makes you keep watching and that is the intention of seeing its end! But at last, you'll find nothing... just some kinds of boring imaginations with slow storyline...!
Though, there may be few points in some scenes which the fans claim about, but while the storyline is boring and goes in a slow way of playing which makes you feel watching a snail crawling on the edge of a rail and of course sometimes stops in this way for minutes; then, what would you say about it...?!",1,32,54,18 August 2019
Joker," Exactly the real Joker..!
","I've watched this movie three times and every time I felt more close to Arthur(Joker)!As I've found that some didn't like this movie, even the high level criticizers, in my opinion the reason is mostly because they couldn't attach themselves with this character as a poor mentally ill person which in 'Joker' words; ' the society abandons him and treats him like trash' or maybe the slow process of storyline has bothered them or even they are from a capitalist class, or...etc. but whatever is their reason, the truth is that those people who are from a poor and mid class, felt more closely to this character which is fortunately and by master chosen, played by 'Joaquin Phoenix'.This intention for making a riot against capitalist class who consider themselves the saviors with a kind of society that believes that too, and cruelty and inhumanity comes out of it, is touchable in all cultures and countries nowadays.These are all about the story part which had made the whole story to change in our minds that maybe the HERO is Joker, not Batman who is a son of that capitalist class(I don't mean what Joker's ideology leads to be, is right and perfect, of course not; but the feeling Inside is really close to him).These politicians and capitalists are all making millions of 'Jokers' all over the world and It'd be interesting to say at least in my country, those who didn't like this movie are mostly the wealthy people and their supporters!! (not all of them, for sure).Beside all I said about the story and the philosophy behind it( which is my own concept), I think everything else is good about this movie. Who can deny Joaquin Phoenix perfect acting??! Or what would be wrong about the direction and other parts, maybe some miner things but those can really be overlooked or as an audience, not really important.It wasn't just an introduction for the past of Batman and his hateful enemies, but an introduction for 'Joker' side and view of the whole story that changes the belief of being against this character to be like something in his side...!As a criticism to be fair, it lacked one thing for me and that was the time which was spent for 'Joker', I think the movie needed one more hour after the hospital scene... :)Anyway, at last I hope a lot for Mr. Phoenix, Mr. Philips and all the movie people for the Oscar ceremony 2020.",10,3,5,9 February 2020
Marriage Story," 'Just Perfect' , but not for everyone's style!
","Everything is really good about this movie, I don't know why some think the opposite unreasonably! The acting, directing, all processing is perfect, you can feel every moments with the characters and their senses in case of reactions...
And the story is actually a truth in everyday life all over the world in every cultures and countries; this kind of stupidity which lots of couples have and in this case it leads to divorce, is over than any particular culture and everyone can feel it as if they see everywhere... these are actually clear and there's even more... it's just another kind of perfect movie about relationships and miss understanding of both genders about each other; Well, actually it seems to me.
I loved it.",10,3,4,14 January 2020
