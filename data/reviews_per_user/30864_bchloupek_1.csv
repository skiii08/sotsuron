Casablanca," Absolute Perfection
","This movie deserves all the praise it gets.  And for those idiots who have the audacity to pass this movie off as so-so, im sorry they have that poor of cinema taste.  How can you not like this movie???  Really...Humphrey Bogart, he is the definition of cool in the 40s.  Peter Lorre plays a perfect shady low life charecter.  Ingrid Bergman is incredible.  If nothing else, you at least have to pay respects to this movie for the incredible amount of one liners that have been remembered and continuously parodied over the years.  As time goes by is a perfect song to make the movie. Anyone who cant find at least one good thing about this movie should be locked up and forced to watch glitter and star wars episode 1 for the rest of their lives.  This movie is an example of how good movies were before cgi and special effects could get a movie like deep impact to the big screen. Heres looking at you kid!",Null,0,0,2 February 2003
