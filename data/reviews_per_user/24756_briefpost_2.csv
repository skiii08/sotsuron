Minority Report," I must be the minority
","Started this movie with great expectations, all names were present to make this a 'One to watch'. Sadly this movie proved that the right cast doesn't nescesarrily makes a great movie.Granted, the concept is worked out, and the movie is consistent, but it laks any kind of originality and depth. Graphics are good, storyline is solid, 'tough boring.The movie starts good, giving it a a twist of twelve monkeys meets matrix, but just to go sadly down the road to an average cops-and-robbers plot. Not even the positively surprising character Tom Cruise accomplishes to portray can save the weak plot that just didn't do justice to this movie.This movie had everything to make it a classic, and that's what i'd expected, but i can only conclude that Steven S. didn't give this movie what makes his other movies masterpieces, his heart just wasn't in this one.
Not a bad movie by any standard, but no more than that.",Null,0,0,14 December 2002
Donnie Darko," A cultish classical epic
","This movie tells the ancient story about self-sacrifice, put into a new jacket. The makers have succeeded well in the interweaving of the storyline in a otherwise out-of-sync story. This makes that only if you keep track of the apparent non-intertwained storyline will make you understand the real clue. The funny thing is that the storyline is told in such a matter that if you keep track of it you're at about the same level of understanding as Donnie is, throughout the movie, resulting in an understanding of why he decides to take the actions the way he does.I expected very little of this movie, and was reluctant to rent it.After i saw it, i bought it, and added it to my cult collection, not the best i have by far, but to good not to have.Zion.",Null,0,0,13 December 2002
