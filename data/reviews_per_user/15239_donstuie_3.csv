Alien 3," A flawed masterpiece
","I first saw Alien 3 when I was 12 years old, and I admit that at the time I was one of many young guys weened on James Cameron's Aliens, and thus incredibly eager to see the continuation of the story. I thought to myself 'Man, they had big cool guns, hordes of creepy Aliens, wisecracking marines. This has gotta blow that away surely!'. And what I got was not Aliens on steroids as I was expecting (and sorry to admit now, hoping for) but a thoughtful, character-driven drama that not only didn't have lots of guns or Aliens, but had NO GUNS, and ONLY ONE ALIEN WHICH IS HARDLY SEEN FOR MOST OF THE MOVIE. WTF??? I still enjoyed the movie, but through my pubescant eyes couldn't see the real beauty of it. 'Why are they just sitting around when there's an alien out there?? THEY KILLED HIX N NOOT!!! WHAAAA!!!'Now I'm a 26 year-old student of film, and in my maturity and the passage of time I've learned to love this film more each time, seeing a new layer or different feeling with each subsequent viewing, reaching yet another level of appreciation with the DVD release of Fincher's intended cut of the film. Much has been said about the turmoil that surrounded the making of this film (see making of...), but history has told us that what we've heard barely scratches the surface of the ordeal Fincher had to go through to get this film made. On one side he had Fox wanting to make Aliens 2, and on the other he had producers at Brandywine that wanted total control of the story and for Fincher to be little more than a hired hand. Fincher is an artist, and wasn't going to let ANYONE get in the way of him achieving his vision for this film, but it was this bravery on his part that proved to be the downfall both for him, and this film. This film is unfairly maligned in the public's eyes, and is still seen by many through those same 12 year-old eyes that I grew out of a long time ago. For me now, I see each film in the trilogy (I regard Resurrection and AvP as a different universe altogether) as the logical continuation to the previous installment. Alien: There's a monster killing us, we have nowhere to escape to. Aliens: We've got big guns, let's waste em! Alien3: I can't believe it, they're still not dead. No matter what I do this won't stop haunting me. The story again centres on Ripley, this time crash landing on a maximum security 'Double-Y chromosome' prison planet, her companions from the previous exploits dead. She is surrounded by murderers, rapists, thieves as well as company men. People that have turned their back on the world and taken on religion as a form of redemption for themselves. Long story short, an alien came back with her, and hijinks ensue.From the moment Ripley lands on the planet, you get the sense immediately that there is no hope. The environment is grim, dirty and there is a sense of utter hopelessness about this place. Fury 161 is a beautifully designed and lit environment that is both sad as well as threatening. A major complaint from people about this film is that it's too depressing and dreary, but it adds to the overall theme of the film, hopelessness and redemption. Gone is the haunted house feel of the first film, and the video game action of the second, replaced by a character study of a person that has lost everything and how one copes with that. The alien is almost an afterthought, as more time is spent investigating how a person can continue to get themselves back up when all hope seems lost. The fact that she shares the danger with a group of prisoners makes it all the more poignant. They are here for the rest of their lives, they've got nothing to look forward to, but they still see the good in their simple isolation, and thus rally for one final chance at redemption. In terms of character development, this film far exceeds the first two, with Ripley and these prisoners affecting one another in very logical and emotional ways. The music is also brilliant, the best of the series, one moment screechingly terrifying, the next hauntingly beautiful. There are other levels to the story also. There is a very strong religious theme, both with the faith of the prisoners as well as Ripley's lack of it. Why should she believe that good things are on the horizon? Everyone she has ever cared about is dead, and yet she continues to be hunted. Is there something wrong with her? Did she do something to deserve this fate? Sigourney Weaver again excels as Ripley, and IMO deserved an Oscar nom more for this performance than Aliens. She truly is one of the great actresses of our time. Each viewing of this film brings forth something new and often wonderful, however flaws still remain. The shoddy rod puppet alien affects are severely dated, and characters changing personalities at different points (perfect example being Golic, going from a ranting 'Charles Manson's British cousin' to 'some guy from Liverpool') as well as the ever gnawing question of how the alien got on the ship to begin with. But really, these don't take away from the beauty of this story as long as one is prepared to scratch the surface. Leave your pre-conceived notions at the door, take the time to do some homework about the making of this film and what Fincher was really trying to achieve, and then see this movie. Hopefully you'll come out the end in agreement with me that this is a wonderful movie, but sadly a missed opportunity at a classic. If only they left him alone.",8,0,4,7 January 2007
Zodiac," Fincher's finest moment as a filmmaker?
","It bugged me to learn that this film was being marketed as 'From the man who brought you Se7en', because I knew that it would possibly hurt the film because not only is Se7en a true masterpiece of the thriller genre that may never be eclipsed in our lifetime, but this is a different universe altogether, and a different time.Forget the shocking thrills, and overall creepiness of the former. This is a film made by a director with complete control of his art, like the steady hand of a painter or sculptor. A measured look at the often forgotten victims of serial killers, the people that had to live with it daily as their lot in life. To add cheap scares or abrupt music-video style editing to such a human drama would greatly diminish the effect of this film. After this film Fincher is no longer just a master of thrills, but a master of storytelling.The beginning of the film begins in expected fashion. A young couple sitting in lover's lane, gunned down in their car; the first victims (but ones that would have huge value even 20+ years later). From here we move to the life and times of those for whom the Zodiac would become their life, and it is through these eyes that this movie is played out. We see the wide-eyed wonder and utter determination and obsession of Gyllenhall's Graysmith, the cynical and drunken musings of Paul Avery (Downey Jnr was born to play this role) and the slow disintegration of Det Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo's best performance IMO). While the first 1/3 of the film does contain some very graphic and frightening murder scenes, the majority of the film strays away from that to the point where Zodiac is part of the furniture for these guys, and we can see in their frazzled faces (no doubt due to Fincher's meticulous need for perfection which famously rubbed the actors the wrong way).We're with these guys every step of the way. Every dead-end, every empty alley, every frustrating act of red-tape and bureaucracy. Years pass with a simple fade-to-black, or in one case a time-lapse of the building of the TransAmerica building. While not much 'happens' in this film, we are captivated throughout, and while we know what the final result would be it doesn't make the whole experience any less frustrating or heartbreaking. We're in it with these guys, and we feel their pain and frustration, and this is a credit to Fincher, and his need for perfection.This definitely isn't a film for the Se7en/Fight Club 'crowd', but for anyone who enjoys great storytelling and human drama in its most real and naked form, see Zodiac.Mr Fincher, you've made a lot of believers out there.",9,1,2,17 May 2007
Transformers," Michael Bay, I was wrong
","Yes, I was one of those guys who thought this movie was doomed when Bay's name was mentioned. How wrong I was.What a ****ing spectacular movie! Forget the rest, THIS is the movie extravaganza of the year, and without a doubt redeems Michael Bay in my eyes. As one of those fanboys who's bile caught in my throat when I heard Bay was the man in charge, I now humbly admit my mistake.The film begins in spectacular fashion, with a brief voice-over from Optimus Prime going over the basics to get us going, followed by the attack on the army base in the middle east that we have seen in trailers. This opening scene for me is one of the most visually spectacular openings I've witness, and had great tension, followed by incredible action. It really gets you into the headspace for what to expect from this movie.We then meet Sam Witwicky (Lebouf), who is searching for his first car with his old man (again, as seen in the trailer), with a great cameo from Bernie Mac. Lebouf is actually very strong in this film, and expertly plays the uncomfortable teen who at first seems out of his depth with what is happening around him, but gradually grows as the film progresses. As for Megan Fox, well, let's just say she had very little to do other than get dirty and sweaty, and occasionally show some girl power. Considering the subject matter, performances are pretty solid throughout. Especially from Turturro who plays what can only be described as a ****ing nut-job CIA type. Yes there is some tacky dialogue, way-too-obvious product placement and stuff that has you rolling your eyes in disbelief, but at the same time there is some great humour and really poignant moments at times. I thought the acting was perfect for the type of film this is.But enough about the meatbags, onto the real stars. Visually these guys look incredible. Some of the best VFX you will ever see in a movie, and the action sequences left me speechless. My only beef is that we don't see a whole lot of the decepticons after the first 1/3 of the film, and Megatron and Starscream only appear at the end. Much more time is devoted to the autobots, and perhaps a bit too much time. But I can't lie and say I didn't feel giddy seeing that blue truck entering through the smokey darkness. The climax of the film is a sight to behold, as the autobots and decepticons tear the **** out of central LA. Overall the visual effects and action are truly unbelievable, and still have me more than a little speechless. I suggest you go and see for yourself.No doubt this film will have its haters, but I absolutely loved every second of it. It was most definitely Transformers in body and spirit.",8,0,2,28 June 2007
