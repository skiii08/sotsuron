Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not worth watching
","Disgusting movie, it just adds to the prejudice that we Americans are known the world over for. This film is not much different than the black-face white comedians of the past. Nothing funny, this movie does not even get the culture right. It is just a anti-Islamic diatribe, more fitting for the fascist culture that certain types are trying to bring here. How disgusting to add to the miss-information that we have about the former Soviet states. For instance; women had more rights and privileges under the former Soviet system that they do here in the US now. This film wants to show something other than that. This Sacha Cohen doesn't deserve much credit for being 'funny', with his cheap shots and bigotry.",1,7,14,27 March 2007
