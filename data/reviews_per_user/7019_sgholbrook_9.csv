Insidious: Chapter 2," 'Well Needed Prequel/Sequel'
","Going to be BRUTALLY honest. I hated the first film. It was downright ridiculous and since I watched it I have repeatedly brought it up as one of the worst films I have seen ! This is why I have only today watched the second film, because I heard a couple rumors that this one made the first a LOT better ! And that I can agree, BIG TIME ! The story to this one is a lot more see-able, and the whole first film (as well as the rest of the second one) is kind of explained in the first 10 minutes and gives a reason as to why things were a little bit ridiculous before. As the story progresses it links in EXTREMELY well to the first and is actually really gripping to see where it'll take a turn next. The scary factor wasn't GREAT, but it isn't needed to make this film what it is. Highly recommend putting yourself through the first film before you watch this one, as it makes the second chapter sooo much better ! This has really changed my opinion of the, I guess, trilogy. And I will be going to see the third one once it is out on Friday and look forward to seeing what the teaser to the next film means at the end of this one, hopefully not bringing the quality of films down again, I am a little skeptical.",8,0,0,3 June 2015
The Maze Runner," 'One BIG Puzzle'
","Didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did.... I went into it thinking of something similar to 'The hunger games' considering it's based off of some books, and it's about some kids stuck in a world they don't know about. And to be honest, it is kind of the hunger games, apart from you know a lot less about why they are there/who they are etc.... And they don't HAVE to fight each other ! I think I prefer this over the hunger games due to all of the questions in it. The film addresses so many that it keeps you guessing all the time, and really gets you intrigued, it really is all ONE BIG PUZZLE. By the end of the film you are amazed at the answers to some of the questions and others are left unanswered. I can't wait to find out what the next film has to offer as I haven't read the books, it's a huge mystery of a story and they do it very well. This film is full of suspense, thrill and emotions. Well worth a watch, to get yourself right into the series !",8,0,0,12 June 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," 'Where is the Big Finale !?'
","This is a very down to earth disaster movie ! Compared to others it does have more reality to it, which made it a lot better ! It was interesting to see the build up before it all happened and get to know characters, which at the time, you didn't know we're main or not. This then results in a few being taken out of the story due to the twists and you are left with the main few. It was an easy watch, with no real proper concentration needed. Come the end it seemed very anticlimactic, simply... One thing happens, which results to something else and that was it. No BIG event really, and I was left expecting more ! Once again it was good to see something so recognizable be turned upside down by such a big event, BUT it needed more of an impact for me to give it anymore than 6/10.",6,0,1,8 June 2015
Interstellar," 'Rocketing over my head'
","Don't understand the hype for this one ! Good film, but I think it's overrated. The story and idea is great, but some added extra's, like a walking box of metal called TARS, seems unnecessary and annoyingly unrealistic. The story was good and simple, and then it got very complex and difficult to follow, and it seemed only possible to follow if you had at least an A-Level in physics or something similar. It got to the point where you only found the action parts interesting, and the emotional part (which did hit quite hard actually) but by the time the story pieces together any unsolved puzzles I had found I had lost interest. It all does tie in quite well from start to finish, but once again in an unrealistic fashion with some strange dimension we have never seen or heard of before. Good concept, plot twist and ideas, BUT I think it could have been don't better ! There isn't much else to say. I think I was expecting too much just to be led into something so confusing.",4,0,2,13 June 2015
American Sniper," 'Fades to Black.....'
","Very good film to represent war, I think it was done pretty accurately. At least that's how it feels for someone who hasn't been to war. The movie seems to be filmed in a slightly different way to usual, skipping big moments usually hovered over for too long in any other film. It says 'this is going to happen' and then skips to the chase and cuts straight to it happening, I liked this as it seemed to work well with the film. It follows an interesting relationship between one man and his family and one man and his army crew (whatever the special name is for them), but can be quite slow at times although they are cutting big bits out, and seems to go on for quite a bit. The action scenes are great with some really gripping decisions in the balance and DOES seem completely realistic. My MAIN problem with this film, is that it takes the jump cut editing a little too far, so much so, that it feels like the film has no end. At one point the screen fades to black (out of no-where) and writing comes up explaining the end of the film as if they couldn't be bothered to film it. It was a BIZARRE experience ! I will certainly remember it, but that doesn't necessarily mean I liked it !",6,1,5,13 June 2015
Ant-Man," 'Pick on Someone Your Own Size'
","Absolutely nailed this film. It's refreshing to have a new face with his own film bring something new to MARVEL where they can start a character from fresh. The whole concept opens up a whole new world for marvel to play with... And they toyed with it VERY well in this film. The characters are very elaborate and make what is already a fantastic idea for the franchise even better. This new power allows anything to now be make cool and seen from a new perspective and I think that's what made this film fly by. The story is great (as ever) and just makes you LOVE Ant-Man. For any MARVEL fans you will see this anyway, but it is 100% worth it and for anyone who isn't a marvel fan, at least give it a try... It's a little different ! And just so people know, make sure you hang around for AFTER CREDITS and AFTER AFTER CREDITS ! Yes there are TWO ! Don't miss out",9,1,9,17 July 2015
Jurassic World," 'For the Old and the New'
","I have seen bits and bobs of the first few films, so this was basically a new experience for me ! I thought the film was done really well and definitely breached the 12A certificate, the kids sat in front of me were at one point sat on their dads laps ! It is kind of bloody, loud and 'scary' for the younger audience, but for the older ones that made it even better ! The CGI looked incredible and the story included lots of different aspects of this new park along with some old references to the ones before which are nice touches for big fans of the franchise (because even I noticed them). The only problem I had was that very little was left to surprise because, as well as the trailer did at making people want to go see it, you might as well walk in in the last 20 minutes and then you'll have all the new clips you haven't seen before ! The whole hybrid creating of dinosaurs was a nice aspect revealing a whole new level of terror in the creatures of the film as you don't know what they have used to create the Idominous Rex (and are eager to find out as you see it use more and more abilities you didn't know it had) This film is a definite watch for old or new fans of the series, and definitely wasn't a let down. Go see it !",9,18,42,16 June 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," 'This ain't that kind of movie, bruv'
","Incredible Film ! Absolutely NOTHING wrong with it whatsoever.... When 2 hours goes by in what feels like 45 minutes you know a film is good ! This has everything you need, the action, the gore, the emotions, the comedy (making fun of other generic spy movies, and yet performing EXACTLY that is a very cleverly done and successful irony), the secret agency, the gadgets, the crazed villain, the music. You name it, it's got it ! From start to finish, it's gripping and leaves you asking where it is going to go next. I don't want to say too much as I feel it just needs to be watched not knowing too much about it. What I DO want to say is that it makes you WANT the villain to succeed that little bit longer just to see how things pan out ! And Samuel L. Jackson does an amazing job of that ! It is DAMNRIGHT FANTASTIC !",10,3,9,8 June 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," 'Explosions, Fire, Guns, Cars..... MADNESS'
","Truly Incredible ! That sums it up rather well. If you are looking for a film about 90% action and 10% other stuff ! This is the film for you. It was truly 'action packed' ! From start to finish I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen and the story is SO simple, yet SO effective. Being, I imagine, one of the younger viewers, it didn't matter that I couldn't really remember seeing the first few films. This brought them to a whole new level anyway. I didn't view this film in 3D but am SO keen to go back and see it again and not make the mistake of 2D next time ! Don't get me wrong, the 2D was brilliant... But there was obvious moments MADE for the 3D and with all the explosions and madness in the film I think it would work extremely well..... Unless it motion blurs. Then you're screwed to see anything !",9,2,12,2 June 2015
