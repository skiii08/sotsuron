The Benchwarmers," Great movie!
","This movie was great...it was so funny, and i was constantly smiling throughout the whole movie. My friend and i went and thought it was great..its all a matter of opinion though, considering most people don't like Napoleon Dynamite and my friend and i thought that it was hilarious. Everyone who loves a good laugh should see this. Jon Heder was hilarious as usual..i don't normally like David Spade but he was really good in this movie, and Rob Sneider did an awesome job too! i would totally go see this movie over and over and over again and again. And when and if it comes out on DVD i will be one of the first to purchase it!I definitely recommend this movie, it was awesome! I hope you enjoy it too!!",10,5,16,7 April 2006
Silent Hill," I'm confused...
","OK, this movie was 'alright' but like my friend and i were really confused....can someone PLEASE tell me....what the heck happened at the end, we don't understand what happened there and would love to know!!we enjoyed the movie...but were lost in a few parts, then we hit the end and we were like what the heck...and we still have yet to find out what the ending was about, like how come they were like that?????????????The movie making, itself was excellent, the computer stuff and that was completely amazing, i couldn't believe how well that was done. Apparently it is based on a video game??maybe that is why we had trouble understanding it, but if someone could clear up the ending for me that would be terrific than i can stop driving myself nuts about it!!!!thanks!",4,1,3,25 April 2006
