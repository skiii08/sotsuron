The Ring," a highly suspenseful movie with something more to it
","considering that the trailer left me a bit confused as to what the movie was actually about, i originally decided to go on the basis that naomi watts, one of my favorite actors, was no doubt going to give a stellar performance as the lead and that the different clips were hinting at a kind of scary movie that isn't quite so predictable.  not being one to take movies like this lightly, as i am girl who is scared very easily, i was still immediately intrigued.what makes this movie different from most horror movies is that it still elicits a sense that as a movie it should continue to have all of the necessary elements of making an evocative story.  the plot is consistently developed, each character is integral in determining the nature of these mysterious occurrences (and the actors accurately and skillfully portray these roles), and just when everyone in the audience suspects that the pieces are falling into place, another twist comes along.  the script is rather intelligent, and it gives just the right combination of fear and weakness (with a bit of humor interjected for good measure and heightened suspense) to make it an incredibly dynamic and poignant movie.  and it just builds and builds without letting go until the very very end...the tension doesn't subside until the credits hit the screen.the imagery is excellent.  the cinematography is rather noteworthy.  pay close attention to the close up aerial shots that are prevalent throughout the movie.  all of the different components of the film come together and make a story worth remembering.  and it leaves the audience asking questions...not questions of what should have been answered in the movie but questions of how does a person react to this as it is something we've never seen before.  then it makes you demand to see the original. :)",10,0,0,20 October 2002
