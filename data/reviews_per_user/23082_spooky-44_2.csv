Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," True fans will be pleased
","With all the media hoopla giving rise to ridiculously high expectations, that even Mr. Lucas can't possibly compete with, most fair-weather Star Wars fans might be heading home after exhausting waits in line a bit disappointed.  Let's put this in perspective.  This movie will be constantly compared to its predecessors, which in my mind is a little unfair.  In all fairness, 'Phantom' should not be critiqued and analyzed and brought to the mercy of film critics until the series is complete.  Reason being is this movie was not meant to be a stand alone and therefore should not be judged as such.  Those saying that this film in not a Star Wars caliber movie are being a bit hasty.  When the prequels are complete we will see exactly how 'Phantom' stands and its actual potency as a 'begin all' film.  I think most true die hard Star Wars fans, like myself, will accept this film as that, an adequate starting point for more to come.  After all, the original Star Wars was mauled over by critics, and now we consider it to be a classic.  Give it time.A little side note: I was especially pleased by the lightsaber battles. Amazing!",8,0,0,19 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," You can't spell BEST without TESB. Need I say more?
","Undoubtably the best of the triolgy, TESB explores more than just action sequences.  The story itself seems to flow and come alive more than the other two in the series because it deals with emotions and a deeper, more serious story of personal struggles.A little side note:  Personally TESB is the most creative, smart, and overall best film ever made.",10,0,0,19 May 1999
