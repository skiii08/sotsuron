Skyfall," As M Goes Bye
",">> > SPOILER ALERT < << It seems pointless to have a spoiler alert in a Bond film; the tropes are too well-established, although Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson HAVE spent the last couple of films trying to get outside the box. They really succeeded with CASINO ROYALE and in a way did with QUANTUM OF SOLACE, though chiefly by ripping off Clive Cussler. This paint-by-numbers effort by Sam Mendes, however, isn't so much an attempt to get outside the box as a kind of disinterested shrug AT the box - and its contents - and despite a few moments of impressive cinematography falls directly into my category of 'I've no interest in seeing THAT movie again,' which is unusual for a Bond film (a tribute to the amazing abilities of Cubby Broccoli et al.) However although Javier Bardem isn't given much to work with here, there is real audience identification with his character as he tries to achieve what so many Bond fans have wanted to see for so long - the elimination of Judi Dench.Now don't get me wrong - Dame Judy is an OK actress, and is pretty much OK in many films, like MRS HENDERSON PRESENTS or BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. It's just that like John Cleese as Quartermaster... Well, it was a fun twist to throw the actor in for a laugh (or whatever Mrs Dench is supposed to evoke) during the Pierce Brosnan era, but for where the franchise needed to go with Daniel Craig - not the right character for aspirations to seriousness.And that's pretty much all there is to this film - the poignancy of the great Spanish actor as he begs M to join him in a murder-suicide, instead of the lame-ass knife-in-the-back finale that seems WAY too symbolic of the scripting of his part. If only, as Bond weeps after M breathes her last, Bardem could have suddenly shrieked 'Pass the onions, Danny-boy!' as he twisted back up for the final jolt, giving Moneypenny an opportunity to yell 'DUCK, Jimmy!' and redeem herself for what really wasn't ENTIRELY her fault in the Orient Express scene (couldn't Bond hear M yelling 'Take the shot! TAKE THE SHOT'? Is he supposed to be growing deaf with age?? How is that the TOKEN's fault?!?) It's too depressing to contemplate the film much further. The initial motorcycle chase across Istanbul's rooftops is energetic though little more than an homage to the far superior Saigon-scooter chase from TOMORROW NEVER DIES, and once we're ducking tunnels while wrestling atop the roof of a speeding train, we know we're in trouble. A thin plot has sometimes been saved by some magnificent scenery-chewing, but the half-assed assassination scene is a mess and the extended destruction of the Bond manor just feels tired. We sighed with Bardem as he shrugs at the spectacle of Bond giving the sub-boss treatment to a henchman, and seriously - the grounds-keeper needs a flashlight to find the kirk? During a sassenach attack?!? To be honest, I kind of expected this kind of thing from director Mendes, famed, if that's the right word, for the unfortunate contemporary-Hollywood's-prejudices-about-middle-America vehicle, American BEAUTY.Sigh. So... Ralph Fiennes as M, huh? Is the restrained character's demonstrated willingness to stand up for subordinates and get it on with a gun in pinch some kind of signal for something new when James Bond Will Return? I hope so, Barb and Mike, 'cause as far as I'm concerned this is two duds in a row.>> > SPOILER ALERT < <<",3,6,14,9 February 2013
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Fine, Enjoyable Film
","This is a very good family film, and I would say that it compares favorably with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, to which it is inevitably compared. The films are of course as different from each other as the novels are, and each takes certain inevitable liberties with their originals. Both films wind up a bit overblown in spots (too much emphasis on battle, particularly in LotR), and both have minor weaknesses, but provide satisfying entertainment.Lewis' story is too well known to require more than a brief overview. Lucy, a young English girl, magically stumbles into a land where animals talk and magic is real. Her siblings disbelieve her and she is betrayed by her young brother Edmund: out of pride and greed he has succumbed to the blandishments of Narnia's evil tyrant, the White Witch. The Witch is on the lookout because of a prophecy that her reign will end when 2 pairs of humans appear in Narnia. Lucy's other brother and sister eventually discover Narnia and, evading the White Witch's wolf-henchmen, they meet Aslan, a mysterious lion who represents justice and freedom. Unfortunately Edmund's treason has given the Witch rights of him that only Aslan's sacrifice can redeem: without Edmund, the prophecy will not come true.Lucy (Georgie Henley) is naturally the star of the story and so it is a delightful surprise to see the brilliance of scriptwriter Ann Peacock's enriched treatment of Edmund, superbly played by Skandar Keynes. Henley also does a fine job although William Moseley and Anna Popplewell have little to work with as the older siblings. The supporting characters are also wonderful, particularly James McAvoy as faun Mr. Tumnus. Frankly, I think Liam Neeson had a far more challenging role than Tilda Swinton as the White Witch, and he does a VERY creditable job.The story carried me along too well to notice any problems with the CGI. I had uncomfortable memories of the BBC's TV version of the talking beavers Â– they are well-handled here as are all the animals (with an amused nod to the talking horse!)The film's real weakness is that it tries too hard to be a children's adventure and fails to put the appropriate emphasis on the story's big themes: good and evil, destiny and free will, betrayal and redemption, sacrifice and reward. The book has a slightly stylized fairy-tale nature that makes it easy, for example, to accept the appearance of Santa Claus. Despite all its mythological elements, the film fails to capture this.",9,0,0,5 January 2006
Alexander," Sure, an' 'tis Alexandre, King o' de Grakes
","This film got such awful reviews I skipped the theatrical release, but after reading IMDb reviews that suggested it's an overlooked classic I decided to give it a try.The good: It's an Oliver Stone, and has some fascinating ideas and glorious moments of spectacle.The bad: It's a weirdly pc-ized version of the young conqueror and the story is a rambling muddle, full of unintentionally funny moments. Stone hasn't successfully plotted a film about the charisma and tactics of a brilliant but often ruthless visionary, undermined by selfish politics. And those accents!!! Alexander (Farrell) is conceptualized as a multiculturalist questing to unify a world of tyranny and petty politics. Mom Olympias (Angelina) is an embittered victim of Al's lustful dad Philip (Kilmer), taking her vengeance politically. This might work if this was the saga of Phil and Oly, but a major focus is the dynastic/ethnic politics swirling around Al, so vengeful Oly - and her... Greek?... accent - just kind of confuses things.Stone's handling of the love and loyalty of men is also a major fumble, confused by the gay angle and lacking necessary buddy-ing between Al and Hephaestion (Jared Leto). Instead we get dumbth like Al soliliquizing when he should be riding to the rescue of Parmenion or grandly speechifying, to swelling background music, that his veterans should be embarrassed to go home and leave him - then going ballistic, executing the critics, and rolling on. And there are unintentionally funny moments, like Old Ptolemy (Hopkins) sententiously declaring that Alexander has captured the imagination of the world - by taking two more wives (and after the honeymoon scene with Rosario Dawson, Wife One, that really DOES capture the imagination!!!) and the hilarious scene of Al ignoring the death spasms of sick Hephaestion during a monologue on urban planning!?! The multiple accents, particularly Angelina's cross between Garbo and Elvira, are just frosting on the bundt cake.Anyone who thinks this is a subtle nod to Greek tragedy has confused Euripides with Ray Harryhausen. There is no chorus of self-interested shouters in Antigone, and anyway this is not really a parable of tragic inevitabilities or overweaning ambition; it's the opposite! In fact it would have been a better film if it had been straight-forwardly the tale of a young filmmaker bucking the studios and conquering greater artistic territory while jealous subordinates try to stab him in the back...",6,1,2,12 July 2006
Nacho Libre," If you like Benny Hill
","Simple test: did you like 'Napoleon Dynamite?' If so, you'll like this too. If you didn't, or if you can't stand Benny Hill, the Three Stooges, SNL, or... well, ANY absurdist, skit-based, none-too-pc comedy with mildly tasteless humor and the occasional predictable pratfall - Ne-VER MIND! My wife and I laughed heartily several times and smiled indulgently a lot, which puts this light years ahead of 'Curse of the Jade Scorpion' and WAY too much other higher-toned failed comedy. It doesn't compare structurally to Black's crisp 'School of Rock' and is nowhere close to the intelligence of 'High Fidelity;' this is just a campy jokefest, which should be fine if that's something you can handle.Yeah, this picture COULD'VE been better, and if you're looking for stuff to DISlike you'll find many problems: campy plot, disjointed pacing, gags that don't come to an apparent punchline... But that kind of absurd irrationalism can work, and if it works for you, you'll enjoy this film.I don't want to give anything away, but the relationship between Brother Nacho (Jack Black) and Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera), lustful on his side, sweetly bewildered and uninterested on hers, is one of the main sources of humor here! If you don't get that, I don't know what business you have reviewing comedy. More could have been done with Esqueleto (wonderful performance by Hector Jimenez) and Candida (Carla Jimenez), true, but get over it! If you think comedy HAS to make sense, you're going to miss out on a WHOLE lot of comedy!",7,1,2,21 November 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Mixed Emotions
","There are at least two ways to look at Tolkien's epic fantasy.One is to see a story about an intellectual of the landed gentry who lives in a conformist parochial society and yearns to travel to an exciting locus of art and culture. His chance comes when he travels there with his legacy, a tool enabling dominating power that an ancestor cheated from a disreputable primitive in a foreign land. Discovering that his inheritance is the basis of a war between his friends and ambitious evil, the intellectual volunteers for a task for which he is not really qualified. Losing most of his friends, he suffers terrible psychic wounds and although he manages to survive his task to the final victory, he is no longer able to feel comfortable in his old home and, bequeathing it to the former tenant class, he leaves to live forever in a rarified world of ancient culture.The other way is to look at it as a heroic sword-and-sorcery epic in which the good guys beat the bad guys.The trilogy works because it's BOTH those things and a lot more. The movie works, too, but only in the second way. It DOES make a noteworthy effort to reference the cultural richness of the novels, the special effects are amazing, and the performances are universally good. As entertainment, it's great (although I do think the screenplay is episodic and clunky). But as a visualization of a complex, underrated, and yes important 20th century novel, it falls very short.",7,0,0,5 January 2006
The Chorus," An 'InspiringTeacher' fantasy You MAY Enjoy... Or Not
","The three intelligent, well-educated women I saw this film with were, to varying degrees, moved by this story about an under-appreciated teacher who handles troubled teens by believing in and challenging them instead of controlling and punishing them. I obviously wasn't so crazy about it. Let's put it this way: if you can focus on inspiring core values and overlook obvious flaws, you may enjoy this film VERY much, and might also like 'Dead Poets Society' and 'Mr Holland's Opus.' If you're looking for a study of three-dimensional characters facing challenging problems in a complex reality, however, skip this and try 'Stand and Deliver' or even 'The Blackboard Jungle!' Ca suffit!",6,1,4,17 August 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Extremely Violent, but Impressive Special Effects
","It disappoints me that so many people thought this movie was great. Although the sets, costumes, and special effects are FANTASTIC, the movie can't stand on it's own!  There's really no excuse for this - it's perfectly possible to tell a three-part story in parts that have a storyline and plot of their own.  I found the movie to be tedious and had to continually explain what was supposed to be happening to the kids with me.Also, director Peter Jackson has a sadly different vision for The Lord of the Rings (LotR) than that of author J.R.R. Tolkien.  Tolkien did not celebrate war, and while the heroic leader Aragorn practices it, it is out of necessity rather than a desire for glory.  In the book, this makes the ambitious and aggressive warrior Boromir a foil for him and the scholarly Faramir.  That is also why there are so few female leads in the book - the story is about the darkness of power-mongering and the decay of civilization - Tolkien's ideas of female characteristics were creativity, nurture, and management.  The movie, on the other hand, relies heavily on the excitement of violent conflict as a substitute for plot and character development. That may make the film unintentionally relevant in today's political climate, but at a pitiful price.  Tolkien was a scholar who had experienced the devastation of war (WWI) first hand, and returned to celebrate culture and the magic of language and history.  He had a message that our times still need to hear.",Null,0,0,23 July 2003
I Am Legend," A Disappointment
","It's been a long time since I've seen 'Omega Man' or read the original Matheson story, but I'd heartily recommend them as superior entertainment, while this... Well, if you've got nothing better to do, it's not TERRIBLE, but...I have to agree with everybody who says this was all about the CGI, and not about the plot - or, in my opinion, the suspense. There's not enough characterization of the zombies, and too much of Robert Neville - I like Will Smith, but I didn't care for his rather hysterical interpretation, although the interplay with Sam was good. There was too much backstory on the virus (and Neville's family) and too little on the zombies. And things don't seem to have been too challenging for Anna and Ethan - nothing worth talking about, anyway! Ethan isn't really necessary in any way - Sam is the Richie character (I think it was Richie - anyway, it IS kind of a clever riff on the doofus who wanders off in search of the cat...)I can't believe anybody respects the pacing. There are two moments of genuine suspense in the movie - Following the Deer, and the Copycat Trap - and both of them totally failed to have any shock value. Following the Deer turns out OK, while The Copycat Trap builds up and builds up, but then, well, up hops Bob and gets his gun, oh dear he drops it - oh, Sam isn't in as much trouble as we thought - oh, he was, was he - and we wind up waiting around for the dog to change, and then - well, that was that. Poignant, maybe (he has the recovered-rat antitoxin - why not Sam?) but suspenseful - are you kidding? And As for the film's finale, did we really need to see it? I think it was irrelevant (especially with the voice-over), and the prologue is also unnecessary - we could have spent the time getting a few real chills and thrills in.Ruined New York is well done, but it's not like we haven't seen THAT before (couldn't this have been filmed in Detroit, without CGI?) The movie has a kind of moral, which has to do with Neville being wrong about what turns out to be true at the very end. There's a worthy idea there - nothing to do with Matheson's original idea, or the title of the film, of course - but there isn't enough supporting material in the rest of the story for it to be said to be the film's theme - and there's nothing else to the story, really - so why is Neville a legend? Apparently, it's the same reason he was on the cover of TIME magazine...",7,0,0,25 June 2008
Mulholland Drive," Not one of Lynch's Best
","I'm not sure it IS possible to write a spoiler for a David Lynch film! Nevertheless, I am going to refer to the film's key element, a major change in direction:This disappointing effort by director David Lynch gives us two plotlines to choose from - a thriller about a plucky ingenue trying to solve a crime, and a story of frustrated ambition in Hollywood.  It's also full of references to Stanley Kubrick's much better film, 'Eyes Wide Shut'.I love David Lynch, and it would be hard for me to choose between 'Eraserhead' and 'Blue Velvet' for his best film.  'Eraserhead' works as a disturbing fantasy, filled with multi-interpretable elements but a discernible theme of anxiety and responsibility.  'Blue Velvet' works as a straightforward thriller with weird overtones.  This film gestures to both, but, unable to take the thriller part seriously, leaves us with the vastly less interesting theme of frustrated-ambition, interlarded with stream-of-consciousness fantasies.  It's all cross-referenced back to the first plotline, but unfortunately, THAT was the best part of the film!Basically, I'm just not interested in sitting through 2 1/2 hours of the fantasies of a frustrated starlet.  If you are, this mud's for you.",3,0,2,28 June 2002
Black Hawk Down," Exciting, Inaccurate War Story
","I enjoyed this movie very much, and I would say that it is effective at getting its point across - but it's far from anti-war and is fairly described as a flag-waver.  Anyone interested in a more 'balanced' account should read the Mark Bowden articles upon which the film is based, and which have been collected in book form.  The movie takes some dramatic ;-) liberties with the original material!As the movie is extensively described elsewhere at this site, I will just say that I found it difficult to tell the soldiers apart at times, which sometimes makes it hard to follow exactly what is happening and why.  The story is almost continuous action, involving many characters seperated into different groups, which makes it hard to 'get to know' the individuals as in 'Saving Private Ryan.'  On the other hand, 'Black Hawk Down' avoids some of the schmaltz of the Spielberg epic (despite two slightly forced speeches by Eric Bana's 'Hoot.')The movie presents a (literally!) black and white look at Americans vs Somalis, and implies that the Clinton administration was pretty much to blame for keeping too tight a leash on 'our boys.'  The book is VERY different on both counts, and states that, ironically, the Somalis deliberately planned to down U.S. helicopters to force the 'surround-the-wagons' shootout that actually happened.  Bowden asserts that this plan was developed by foreign Arab extremists - read Al-Queda!!!  This isn't explored in the movie.None of that is required to make a good film, and I'd say that, like 'Battle of Algiers,' 'Black Hawk Down' is an excellent film - but take it with a grain of salt!",9,0,1,3 March 2004
A Hard Day's Night," Whatever Happened to Richard Lester?
","Richard Lester is my favorite '60's comedy director; he not only directed the Beatles in this film, 'Help,' and 'How I Won the War,' he also created the hilarious 'A Funny Thing Happened On the Way To the Forum' as well as the darkly funny 'The Bed Sitting Room.'  In the '70's he created the frequently amusing Three Musketeers comedies with Michael York and Oliver Reed.  Then he just sort of faded, bottoming out in the 1980's with the truly dreadful Superman III.  What happened?Lester's style was originally manic screwball humour, and he's near the top of his form here (I think 'Help' is marginally better.)  He's capitalizing on the popularity of the Beatles, but not only do they turn out to be fine comic actors (compare this film to contemporary Brit-comedies like 'Smashing Time' if you want to see how much it really shone at the time) but Lester is able work in some clever digs about the entertainment industry and teen-marketing.",10,1,1,30 July 2003
The Queen," Fun Performances, Insufficient Plot Development
","The Queen has some fascinating performances (and Helen Mirren's most sympathetic character in decades), but there's a LOT of missing information that's necessary to making anything of the movie's main idea, that Tony Blair 'saved the monarchy' during the Diana 'crisis.'As mentioned elsewehere the story, set in the early days of the Blair (Michael Sheen) prime-ministership, is about how after Princess Diana is killed by the papparazzi the royal family, together with the government, must determine how to respond in the face of mounting public pressure for some form of national obsequies.I don't follow celebrities. As far as I could tell, Diana was a pretty blonde who passed through life in the pocket of one or other millionaire playboy. The movie certainly says nothing to dispute that, which leaves me sympathizing more with a family that resents her for dumping their anxiety-ridden son than with the extraordinary obsession the British public seems to have had with her. The royals themselves are presented as peevish and old-fashioned, but so what? The film, however, drops a number of hints that Diana had an awkward marriage with an unfaithful Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) and that the royals supposedly disliked her from the get-go, all of which demands a LOT more explication within the film.This brings us to the 'save the monarchy' pitch. To be honest, I don't understand what that even means. At one point, Cherie Blair (Helen McCrory) suggests that it costs the British government 40 million pounds a year to support the Windsors, but it's my understanding that not only are the royals multi-billionaires in their own right but that the supposed 'subsidy' is actually a portion of the income the British government receives from managing royal property under an 18th century contract. It's like young marrieds Tony and Cherie, living in the in-law suite of the parental home, making part of their income from managing the parental retirement account, then suggesting cutting the parents loose! This would make Tony B's odd outbursts more comprehensible, but as far as the film goes, we just don't really know the reason. The movie, after first suggesting that Blair 'saved' Queen Bess II out of a kind of protect-mom projection, later drops a loud hint that Tony's take on 'the people's princess' was of big benefit to himself. What's lacking, once again, is info within the film's structure that supports any of this.That should be integral to the sub-theme of the direction of the Blair administration. The film talks a lot about Blair's election as a 'revolution' with goals of 'modernizing' Britain, but here again I'm totally confused. I thought that Britain, formerly a failing industrial-socialist state, was 'modernized' by She Who Must Not Be Named back in the '80s. My impression of Blair was a polo-shirt progressive pulling a Clinton to get elected; rolling over his out-of-touch civil-service conservative opponent with a platform of platitudes that thinly disguised his actual economic beliefs, which seem to be just a kind of casual-day capitalism. Seriously, help me out here. Am I way off, or is the film trying to fake up some kind of story that Blair was romanced out of 'real' progressivism by a fascination with The Queen?Well, I'd still recommend watching this, 'cause in addition to Mirren, James Cromwell, Sheen, and Sylvia Syms are terrifically entertaining and the scenery is gorgeous - including Mirren's expanding and contracting legs. I wonder if they weren't considering showing 'em with hair in the barbecue scene? And the scene of the Queen Mum (Syms) learning that her funeral plan would be used for Diana is priceless! For plotting and character development thumbs down, but for the excellent acting, two pinkies discreetly up.",7,0,0,12 March 2007
Blow," The remorselessly embarrassing self-pity of a remorseless man.
","This is a well-acted movie with some truly brilliant make-up work, but it's a ludicrously self-indulgent exercise in unconsciousness and self-pity. Viewers note that it is based on someone's memoirs - which doesn't necessarily make it a 'true story!'George Jung (Johnny Depp) depicts himself as innocently stumbling into pot smuggling in late-'60's California.  It's all in fun, and the only reason an upstanding guy like George skips bail after arrest is to be with his dying girlfriend (Franka Potente), sniff sniff...  However he still winds up in prison, where while teaching pot smuggling to the other inmates he meets Diego Delgado  (Jordi MollÃ ), who introduces him to the cocaine trade.  The connection introduces him to the notorious South American psycopath and drug kingpin Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis), who, Jung feels, respects him as a person.  Jung implies that he interceded with Escobar on behalf of Delgado - what a swell guy!  However Jung makes something of a faux pas when he runs off with the fiance (Penelope Cruz) of colleague Augusto (Miguel Sandoval) - true love and all that, you know, but those Columbians have a peculiar code about such things!  This, Jung feels, explains why Delgado betrays him by starting a competing cocaine business - what other reason COULD there be? Augusto has Jung beaten when he tries to intervene - Delgado is shown listening with a tear in his eye! As if Jung hadn't been betrayed enough, it turns out that new wife Mirtha (Cruz) is just not the caliber of dead girlfriend Barbara, sigh!  When the Panamanian government siezes Jung's bank account (those crooks!), we can see trouble ahead for poor George.  This dirty business is discussed without any real sense of remorse by Our Hero.  Oh yeah, whatever DID become of Tuna (Ethan Supplee)?  Oh never mind, listen to poor GEORGE'S problems!  The moment when California drug-pusher Derek Foreal (Paul Rubens) tells George, 'I guess I forgot who my REAL friends were' left me unsure as to whether laugh or vomit.  Jeez, why DOESN'T this poor martyr receive more prison visits?  (Sound of swelling violins...)You may or may not enjoy this movie - a keen sense of irony will help!",6,3,6,4 September 2003
The Sixth Sense," Healing the Wounded Healer
","A child psychologist, returning home after receiving an award, is confronted by a deranged patient who condemns his former caregiver before shooting him in the stomach and committing suicide.  Emotionally and physically numbed, the psychologist takes on a new patient: a child who believes he can communicate with the dead.  In addition to feelings of depression and self-doubt, the psychologist is having difficulty in communicating with his wife, who has become increasingly distant since the shooting.  Gradually the relationship he establishes with his patient draws him into a strange reality.	'Sixth Sense' is a character study with profound concerns, on the theme of self-absorption and despair in a spiritual universe.  Somber and low-key, it is misrepresented as a suspense thriller.  Viewers should be prepared for a counterpoint to the works of Swedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman: the fundamental conflict in the film is between alienation and awareness leading to salvation.  Anyone expecting the more familiar Hollywood treatment of ghosts and the afterlife will be disappointed: there is no series of jack-in-the-box surprises as found in 'The Shining' or Nicole Kidman's 'The Others'.  The concerns of 'Sixth Sense' are similar to, but significantly different from, those of Robin Williams' film 'What Dreams May Come', without the dramatic imagery.   While the mood and pacing of 'Sixth Sense' are deliberately oppressive, the final revelation illuminates not merely the series of clues scattered throughout the film but the predicament of the protagonist... and by implication that of the audience.	This is a well-crafted and thought-provoking film, and the acting, while restrained, is also excellent.  Ironically, many viewers have found the surprise ending to be a distraction: some people seem to have sat through the film waiting for 'the twist'.  Paying attention to the characters and the message that is developed in the story will be more rewarding.  However if you dislike Bergman-esque films this one is not for you either.",10,0,0,10 September 2002
Princess Mononoke," Odd and Unpredictable
","If you can look beyond the hype, this film is fascinating and radically different from its U.S. competition.  It's an odd rambling adventure, and contains a good deal of violence that makes it too strong for very young viewers.  I would recommend it for middle-school children, but for adults its chief charm is its unpredictability.What happens in this film is never what you might expect.  Standard Hollywood ideas of story development, in which bad behaviour brings about its own punishment and difficulties are valuable learning experiences, are largely ignored and the film does not end with all problems resolved. Most of the characters are not at all complex, however, and, with a few key exceptions, are relatively standard for contemporary Japanimation (anime.) There is nothing that could really be described as character development, there isn't really much of a plot, and the story just sort of ambles along to a puzzling ending.Other reviewers have encapsulated the story.  Prince Ashitaka is the beautiful, stern young protagonist standard for anime.  He rides a red elk and contradictorily fights with the power of hate, which provides the movie with some wholly unnecessary additional violence.  Princess Mononoke is the pretty teenage heroine likewise standard for anime.  She has been raised by wolves and consequently wears a fur stole (er - wolf fur?) and white jewelry.  The most interesting characters are the rascally monk/imperial agent Jigo, and Lady Eboshi.  Why does the emporer support Lady Eboshi in creating Irontown?  Why is she building up a powerbase?  Does she form a society of lepers and former prostitutes for humanitarian reasons, or for their loyalty?These and many other questions are never resolved, which adds some intrigue to the story.  However even the theme of the film, that humanity is out of touch with nature, is handled in a vague and contradictory way.  Are the humans supposed to embrace nature by putting on warpaint and riding wolves, or just not be in the forest at all?  Just how natural ARE boars that talk and wear warpaint?  Is the willingness of the wolves to let the boars die, or the attitude of the monkeys, meant to cast an ironic light on Princess Mononoke's faith in solidarity with nature?  The film also makes vague gestures in the direction of immanence but again, nothing is very clear.None of this is necessarily BAD, but it's hard to derive an ultimate meaning from all these tantalizing puzzles.  Still, it's a lot more intriguing than anything I've ever seen from Disney.",7,0,3,31 July 2003
