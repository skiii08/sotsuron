Spartacus," A film which actually lives up to its budget
","Made for the then-unheard-of sum of $12 million, and involving 10,500 people throughout the course of production, 'Spartacus' probably still stands today as the biggest film ever made.  What makes it more than this is a commitment to theme and character too often absent from big-budget Hollywood.It seems trite to say a film is about 'what it means to be human,' but that is indeed the core, the thread which runs through this magnificent epic. The quest of a man to prove to himself and the world that he is indeed a man.The existence of the character of Spartacus seems almost impossible.  How could a man who was born in bondage, whose family had been mere chattel for generations, who has been treated his entire life as a beast--how could such a man be so SURE that he was more than just a body to be used up, and that freedom was his destiny?It seems unrealistic, but it is not.  Anyone who has read 'The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass' knows that this strength and pride can burn inside a slave even when there is no external force to spark or sustain it.  Like Douglass, Spartacus is a man who knew, intrinsically, that he and people like him deserved more.There is much, much more to this film than just Spartacus, of course.  But it is his growth into a truly free human being that left the strongest impression of me.  He develops from a man barely capable of articulating his feelings at the film's beginning ('I am not an animal!') into a true leader who is ultimately a far greater man than the ruthless, privileged Crassus could ever hope to be.  Early on in the film, Spartacus expresses shame to his love Varinia that he cannot read, that he does not understand the forces of nature such as wind and the movement of the heavens.  Varinia responds, simply, 'You know things that cannot be taught.'  Surely enough, near the film's conclusion, the educated and urbane Crassus struggles to understand Spartacus and Varinia's love for him.  'I want to understand!' he exclaims in anguish.  But he could never understand what Spartacus knew intrinsically, even though he could not read a single word: the value of each human being, be they rich or poor, free or slave.These grand themes are subtly tempered by the presence of Batiatis and Gracchus, two very flippant, cynical, down-to-earth characters who present a gray area between the grand extremes and dramatic speeches of Spartacus and Crassus.  Peter Ustinov won a much-deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar for slimy, wimpy slave-trader Batiatis; Charles Laughton could just as easily have won for the decadant but ultimately good-hearted populist politician Gracchus.  Add on Olivier's stunning performance as Crassus (truly a screen villain writ large--on par with the greatest), and you're left wishing that somehow the Oscar could have been split three ways.  Quite frankly, I'm at a loss to think of another film which boasts THREE supporting performances of this calibre.The film isn't without its weak points, however.  Tony Curtis as Antoninus and John Dall as Glaborus take the viewer out of the world of the film with their unapologetically modern dialects.  In the end, though, these are minor quibbles within a major cinematic achievement.  Easily one of the 100 greatest films ever made--I'm rather disappointed to see it so low on the IMDB top 250.",9,3,5,14 April 2004
Predator," Solid, well-executed action film that continues to impress
","*Possible spoilers*'Predator' is arguably the best of the '80s/early '90s action bonanzas. Well-conceived, psychologically taut, visually vibrant and deeply entertaining, it has aged remarkably well. The direction, screenplay, special effects, and general production values of 'Predator' are just as muscular and confident as its cast. Even when the movie slips into excess (which it frequently does, with gratuitous flexing, absurdly over-the-top firefights, and unabashed macho banter), it does so with such a boisterous swagger that you can't help but hop on for the ride. This is film-making at its most self-assured and unapologetic. Director John McTiernan has said he set out to make a classic popcorn movie, and he succeeded in spades.The story is surprisingly thematically strong, and believe it or not, it owes that to the depth of Schwartzenegger's character--a monster-movie hero who's actually on par with the monster. Every action hero has to have his requisite humanizing moments--it's par for the course. Smiles at a kid, saves a puppy, blah blah blah. But Dutch's are more effective than any other instances I can think of because they are so believable and unforced. 'I don't do this kind of work,' Dutch says indignantly after he learns his team ('We are a rescue team, not assassins.') has been duped into attacking a rebel camp on the pretense of rescuing hostages. It's really a great moment--a simple, unexaggerated statement of ethics--as tough as Dutch and his team look, they derive real pride from the fact that they are in the business (primarily) of saving lives rather than ending them. It's not shoved in our faces, we don't have to watch Dutch cradling a tattered child's doll in the wreckage or anything--it's just there. This crucial humanizing moment makes Dutch's struggle with the Predator all the more striking--he has to give in to that part of himself that he rejects early on in the movie: the aggressor, the killer, the hunter, the savage. He has to allow this part of himself to take over in order to survive. The ensemble cast deserves kudos, too (especially Bill Duke in the performance of a lifetime as the smoldering Mac)--the film is much deeper and richer thanks to their spirited characterizations. We ACTUALLY CARE when these guys (who would be called 'side characters' in most other action movies) are picked off by the malicious demon that hunts and haunts them. Again, the characterization is effective and feels genuine, which lends greater meaning to the central action of the movie. As screen writing formulas go, this is definitely not rocket science, and most action and horror films attempt it in some form or fashion, but surprisingly few do so successfully.And, of course, the other star of 'Predator'--the creature itself, is masterfully conceived and designed, both with and without the mask. It still stands (along with, yes, the Alien) as one of the coolest and most imaginative monsters ever put on film.This is a very important movie to people (especially guys) of my generation--I remember re-watching it repeatedly when I was ten or eleven (probably too young!), totally fascinated and drawn in to the primal story of kill-or-be-killed. I can honestly say that this appeal has not dwindled one iota. If, like me, you grew up on 'Predator,' I highly recommend picking up the new DVD so you can see for yourself how well it has stood the test of time. If you haven't seen it and have any respect for action films or thrillers whatsoever, check it out.",8,13,15,12 August 2004
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," So stale it crumbles
","You know that moment in every action or horror movie when the baddie is just about to kill, maim, bite, or otherwise put the hurt on a sympathetic character, when another, unseen sympathetic character shoots/stabs/whatevers the baddie in JUST the nick of time? 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' is an entire film based around just repeating that moment again and again and again. Each time, the director (who's somehow less famous and reputable than Paul W.S. Anderson, if that's conceivable) honestly seems to expect us to react to it, which borders on insulting. While it's not the worst movie of the year ('Day After Tomorrow' and 'AvP' have it beat, while 'Chronicles of Riddick' has it just about even), it's easily the most repetitive, predictable and stale--pretty much every shot or sequence you see is blatantly ripped off from some other movie.If there is a redeeming quality to this movie, it's the nice assortment of surprisingly subtle visual references to the classic 'Resident Evil 2' video game, on which it is loosely based. Unfortunately, the movie seems to have abandoned that great game's penchant for eerie atmospheric thrills in favor of constant, ridiculous action. Making an action movie out of 'Resident Evil 2,' a game firmly routed in the cinematic traditions of horror, is akin to making a horror movie out of 'Virtua Fighter'--it's just the wrong idea.Though they may draw similar audiences, horror and action actually aren't all that compatible, and nothing drives that point home like sitting through this movie. It sacrifices scares for explosions, atmosphere for flashy edits, and human fear for superhuman kung fu heroics. The constant use of the aforementioned just-in-time device is an attempt to artificially inject some real fear and tension, but it fails because of its predictability.I'd compare this to the first 'Resident Evil' film if I could remember anything about it besides Milla's brief nudity. This film, thankfully, seems destined to fade from memory just as quickly--leaving only fleeting glimpse of Milla's goodies behind.",3,1,4,13 September 2004
8 Mile," Name a better popstar vehicle movie.
","*Watch out for a very minor subplot spoiler*Shoot, it sure is better than 'Glitter' or 'Crossroads!'  I haven't seen 'Bones' yet, but you know what, I'm willing to lay pretty good money that it's better than that, too.Brittany Murphy could have been totally cut out of this movie and you wouldn't have even FELT it.  But overall, the story's alright, the performances are at times pretty good, the visuals of desolate wintertime Detroit are great, and the music, obviously, is off the charts.  The rap battles make for some of the most entertaining movie moments in recent memory, and the soundtrack (an excellent mix of mid-'90s hardcore hip-hop) is perfect.  There are some moments when you feel a little embarrassed to be watching the movie, though, like mom hitting the Bingo jackpot and instantly solving all her problems.  Or Rabbit's supposedly pregnant ex-girlfriend (played by the pregnant chick from 'Crossroads!'  Irony can be pretty ironic sometimes!) muddling her way through the worst-acted 90 seconds since, well, 'Crossroads.'You can love him or you can hate him, but Slim IS the most significant American pop culture icon since Kurt Cobain.  This (mostly) successful outing into another medium further cements that status.  I'd give it a 6 or 7 out of 10.",Null,0,0,27 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," A pop extravaganza
","All pop culture of the last 30 years collides in a carnival of color, motion, violence, and sound in 'Kill Bill, Vol. 1,' perhaps the most unique action film since 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.'Quentin Tarantino once said that 'Pulp Fiction' was not based on real life, but on movies.  It was a tribute to the fantastic and the exaggerated--all banter and witticism and sex and drugs and blood.  'Pulp Fiction' didn't just breathe new life into movies.  It brought them back.  There is no more apt way to express it than that.  It established a new way for film, laid a new road between the glitz of big-budget Hollywood and the stodginess of indie cinema--both of which were choking on their own dullness.  It found the synergy between pop and art more than any film of our time.Countless filmmakers have followed Tarantino's path since, but 'Kill Bill' proves emphatically that none can navigate its twists and turns with the aplomb and vitality of the creator.  'Kill Bill,' like 'Pulp Fiction,' is an unapologetic tribute to the heightened reality of the screen.  Tarantino ecstatically glorifies the genre films which make up his inspiration: film noir, spaghetti Western, kung fu, '60s biker movies, even animation.  What makes 'Kill Bill' special is that we feel the same ecstasy.'Kill Bill' is arguably the single most violent major motion picture release in American history.  The kung fu sequences are breathtaking ballets of dismemberment, capturing the voluptuousness of carnage as well as any John Woo or Sam Peckinpah sequence.The soundtrack and score are stunning, with Wu-Tang Clan's the RZA providing the original music.  Just as he enhanced the somber 'Ghost Dog' with gritty, tragic rhythms and melodies, he embellishes 'Kill Bill' with flamboyant, aggressive movie music.The cinematography and production design are as striking and daring as anything you've seen in recent memory, and awards are sure to come in those categories.But for all of this, I find myself marvelling at just how good the underappreciated STORY of this film is.  Like kung fu and spaghetti Western films, it is a fable of violence and revenge--relying on its simplicity for impact.  You sort of have to be a fan of these genres to 'get' this, but if you do indeed get it, this becomes perhaps the most heartfelt of Tarantino's tributes.  It is a recognition of films as more than entertainment, that basic moral themes of truth and justice can run underneath even the glossiest and most appallingly violent exterior.",Null,0,0,20 October 2003
This Is Spinal Tap," A true masterpiece
","A recent rewatching of one of my favorite films, 'This is Spinal Tap,' after several years without seeing it, impressed upon me what a truly remarkable work it is.  While the latter-day Christopher Guest mockumentaries are great achievements unto themselves, make no mistake: the granddaddy (guided masterfully by Rob Reiner) is still the undisputed king of this smart, quirky brand of humor.Michael McKean and Guest are so tremendously sharp, so subtle yet so larger-than-life as the quintessential John-Paul/Mick-Keith duo of David and Nigel that the film COULD float along on their energy and tension alone. But this film has performance to burn--with Harry Shearer's dorky bassist Derek, Tony Hendra's pugnacious and believable manager Ian (the great forgotten performance of this film--you'd be surprised how many of the memorable moments revolve around Ian), June Chadwick's unspeakably pretentious Yoko-girlfriend Jeanine, and, of course, Reiner as supreme lamo documentarian Marti DiBergi.This isn't even to mention a series of inspired cameos by Billy Crystal, Paul Shaeffer, and Fran Drescher, among others (look for more of all of them in the extensive deleted scenes, which are a real joy unto themselves).Then there's the music.  Tap improbably spans the generations, from early Beatles/Stones Buddy Holly tribute rock to hippy-dippy psychedelia to adolescent sex metal (in a sense, the decline of Tap is the decline of rock 'n' roll itself).  The songs and musicianship are so stunningly good (even when corny, it's all so extraordinarily well done), which is an excellent example of what makes this film truly great: it recognizes that parody is no excuse for laziness.Hence the high standards of musicianship.  Hence the cleverly crafted songs that you almost expect to hear when you turn on the radio.  Hence the razor-sharp performances and unforgettable characters and relationships. Hence the compelling story, which is at more than one point sadder than it is funny.As it always does, 'Spinal Tap' faded to black (a kind of pastel black) the other night after a blazingly quick and tight 82 minutes.  My friend, who had never seen it before, was mightily impressed.  But not as impressed as yours truly, who was probably watching it for the 12th or 13th time.It's time to stop calling Spinal Tap one of the greatest comedies of all time, one of the greatest mockumentaries of all time, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll films of all time.  The simple fact is, this is one of the greatest movies ever made, period.",10,0,3,8 April 2004
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Consistent and thorough silliness keep this above-average comedy afloat
","I went to 'Anchorman' expecting another super-mainstream, lowest-common-denominator, SNL-derived romp. Now, these aren't the worst movies in the world, to be sure. 'Happy Gilmore' and 'Old School' are pretty agreeable ways to while away the time. But usually about an hour in to these affairs, I've had enough of the broadness and predictability, which starts to get downright oppressive. It's not just that they're lowbrow--it's that they're so overwhelmingly, disappointingly conventional.Luckily, this isn't what 'Anchorman' is. 'Anchorman' is a refreshingly off-kilter outing from an unlikely source--Will Ferrell, the current reigning lord of middle-of-the-road fratboy Sandlerism. The film has a lot more in common with Mel Brooks and Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker than anything in the SNL family tree. It prizes out-and-out silliness and absurdity over bathroom humor and penis jokes (though there's plenty of the latter, don't worry), and pulls it off admirably. In essence, the key to this stuff is never letting off of the goofiness even for a second--the audience should never be allowed to take anything seriously.'Anchorman' achieves this with exceedingly silly and bizarre dialogue complemented by killer comic performances from Ferrell, Paul Rudd, Vince Vaughn and Steve Carrel. You'd have to be lobotomized to maintain a straight face through lines like 'It's made with bits of real panther. So you know it's good.' and 'I'm riding a big, furry tractor!' The direction and pacing are also pretty solid at times, and the requisite celeb cameos are very nicely done (especially in one particular scene which I wouldn't dream of ruining).The film's not without its flaws, certainly. Chief among them is the wasting of one of the best comic character actors in the biz: Fred Willard. If ever there was someone born to play a smarmy local TV newsman, Willard is it. But he's inexplicably cast here as a dull station suit, while David Koechner plods through the sportscaster role that was clearly meant for him--passable but certainly not as inspired as Willard would have been. Also, I think that the story would have benefited if Vaughn and his cronies, the closest thing to villains in this lightheaded romp, had a little more face time.But these are comparatively minor problems--the point is that Ferrel has given us something that's really funny in a way that's appreciably different from the endless SNL movie-mill. It's not Monty Python, but it is a healthy departure from what has become the comic mainstream. Most importantly, the laughs are frequent, long, and deep--check it out and you won't be disappointed.",7,84,154,12 July 2004
Vanilla Sky," A meandering piece of awful
","It's hard to imagine a more disappointing follow-up to Cameron Crowe's delightful, captivating 'Almost Famous' than this confused disaster, which is long on long and short on everything else.This is the kind of movie that needs a killer performance to 'save' it--something to sink your teeth into and distract you from the fact that the story itself has little impact or interest.  Tom Cruise can't do it--not that he's incapable (I actually think he's rather underrated), but the character is a loser of a protagonist.  He's too self-satisfied early on and too self-pitying later to be even remotely likable.  I like Jason Lee a lot, so I'm sorry to say that his tacked-on buddy character doesn't cut the mustard either.Then we get to the ladies...OK, deep breath.  I really, truly mean it when I say that Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz are probably the two worst actresses in Hollywood that aren't working for Vivid Video.  On top of this, as luck would have it, they decided to reserve their worst respective performances for 'Vanilla Sky.' Both of them are positively grating.  'When we come back as cats.'  I hope someone backs over you with their car. 
Crowe deserves as much blame as the cast--he fails to inject any sort of urgency into the film--though probably not through lack of trying.  For example, nice try switching the girls back and forth with alternate shots...too bad Spike Lee made much more compelling use of the same trick a decade earlier in 'Mo' Better Blues.'  This movie didn't need gimmickry and trickery--it needed someone to grab hold of the story and really tell it. Instead, it sort of wanders along, and the big plot twist comes long after all our interest is lost.A real bomb of a movie--avoid at all costs.",3,1,2,18 March 2004
X2: X-Men United," Blows the first one out of the water
","The first X-MEN was, I felt, a very successful outing.  But it lacked the momentous feel and captivating energy of, for example, SPIDER-MAN--which captured perfectly everything that made the comics so wonderful.  X-MEN was a skillful adaptation from a difficult medium with some great performances from 2 great actors, but I wouldn't exactly term it 'great.'X2 is great.  Better than the first, better, even, than SPIDER-MAN.  Not just by a little, but by a lot.From the opening sequence (I'm not gonna ruin it), it's pretty apparent that we're in for something more.  Bryan Singer brings his stylistic influence to bear on this film a lot more than in the original--and the results are appreciated.  His little touches of cinematic deftness make one appreciate the value of having a great director even on a blockbuster action project like this.Another improvement is the length--no joke.  X2 is able to tell a much deeper, and, well, BIGGER story than the first because it's got over 2 hours to do it in.  The extra time allows for more and better action sequences (MUCH better; am I the only one who was a little underwhelmed by the Wolverine/Mystique sequences from the first movie?), sure, but perhaps more importantly it allows for more character.  Not just character development, character INTERACTION--something the original needed more of.  Wolverine and Iceman in the kitchen, for instance, is a great example of the kind of hanging-out-at-the-X-Mansion scenes that helped give the comic book such depth and breadth.SPIDER-MAN was great because it focused not as much on recreating exactly the classic STORY of the comics, but on recreating the things that made that story so great in the first place.  X-MEN did this to an extent, but not as well.  X2 does it better than both of them, and that's why it's a better film than both of them.",8,0,0,2 May 2003
Braveheart," Unremarkable, shallow epic
","Why this passable but completely forgettable film has apparently garnered a reputation as a classic in the last decade is beyond me. There's really not much to write home about here. There's no complexity or levels or anything, just good vs. evil, fight fight fight, freedom freedom freedom. Gibson, of course, is as limited an actor as he's ever been. His corny pre-battle speeches have become wildly popular, to the point where you might be fooled into thinking they constitute great moments in cinema, but in actuality they're somewhere above Bill Pullman in 'Independence Day' and below Al Pacino in 'Any Given Sunday' on the scale of dramatic pep talks. And in case you're wondering, no, that's not a prestigious slot to be in.I'm not trying to say it's unwatchable like 'The Patriot' or anything--it's OK. Probably about as good as, say, 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.' But I don't think anyone who's seen a real epic with real actors would consider it anything special. This is a classic example of how the Oscars can inflate the reputation of undeserving movies in weak years (see also, 'Gladiator, The').",5,13,27,24 September 2004
From Here to Eternity," A different kind of war movie
","For the first couple acts of 'From Here to Eternity,' you may wonder, justifiably, what the film is getting at. We all know the planes are on the way, but the film takes its time detailing the alternate drudgery and revelry of Army life in peacetime Hawaii. Company politics, love affairs, drunkenness, grudges--it's not that it's boring, because it's actually pretty effective drama. But it does seem petty given the impending disaster. I kept returning to the same thought--'This is very good, but not all-time great.'Ultimately, though, the point becomes clear. This is not a story about war at all, but about people. It does not treat Pearl Harbor as a monolithic tragedy, but rather a myriad of little individual tragedies, forgotten by history but no less significant.The time spent on character development pays off. The film's final act is deeply moving, and communicates a profound and lasting statement about war. I was wrong--it IS an all-time great film, and one of the best examples of how a film can be more than the sum of its parts.It's well-documented, also, that this is one of the great casts of all time.Oscar nominees Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster are superb in their leading roles as apparent opposites--the rebel and the good soldier--who turn out to be kindred spirits. The young and gangly Frank Sinatra is funny and bursting with energetic charisma in his Oscar-winning character role, and Donna Reed (another Oscar-winner) shows us some stunning moments of desperation and passion. Did I mention Deborah Kerr and Ernest Borgnine?Highly recommended--9 out of 10.",9,4,7,4 October 2004
