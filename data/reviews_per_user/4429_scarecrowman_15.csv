The Rock," He has all the guns now, sir!
","Ok my question is this:  If Sean Connery had all the guns why didn't he save us all by shooting Nicholas Cage in the head.  This filmed sucked like a leech on a blood packet!  Nicholas Cage is amusing with his comments on how much he loves the Beatles.  This, because people really want to see Nicholas Cage in a Yellow Submarine, miles below the surface where nobody can hear his voice ever again. Satan how ever will have Nick soon enough.  As we all know, Nick sold his soul for stardom.  That is the only rational explanation for his success!The Rock:  '3 crows dead out of 10!'",5,0,2,24 April 2003
Se7en," Perhaps America's Best Suspense Film Ever!
","Maybe I will shoot myself for saying that one day.  It might even be possible I will want to take those words back when I finish this review. Still, at this particular moment I cannot think of an American Suspense Thriller that has ever been as beautiful and compelling as this unique serial-crime drama. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are both amazing and play well off of one another, Freeman especially.  Gwyneth Paltrow does a brilliant job with her brief stint in the film.  Kevin Spacey's portrayal of John Doe is uncompromisingly haunting and utterly disturbing.  This all wrapped up with, what at the time was the most courageous ending in years.Se7en:  '10 crows be-headed out of 10'",10,0,1,24 April 2003
Insomnia," A marvelous film. Christopher Nolan does it again.
","When I saw Insomnia the first time I was a bit disappointed.  I have never been the biggest Hitchcock fan and this film seemed to be a page directly out of the Alfred Hitchcock guide book to film making.  It is not as if I hate Hitchcock I just think his techniques have become over used and cliche. I was really excited about this film before viewing because I am such a fan of Christopher Nolan from his work on Following and Memento.The biggest disappointment however was that the film made me tired.  I caught myself dosing off several times during the film.  Upon repeated viewing I realized that this was the brilliance of the film.  Nolan found a way, perhaps accidentally to make the viewer feel the same way as Al Pacino's character.  This is when it ocurred to me Nolan is still the genius he was two films ago.  The story is great, and the acting superb.  Robin Williams pulls off a great take on a mundane psycho, and Hillary Swank as in Boys Don't Cry helps carry the film.  I recommend this to any Hitchcock fan and if you love suspense films and find yourself disappointed the first time, watch it again and you will love it.",9,1,1,9 February 2003
The Village," He's a genius and critics are busy praising crap like Training Day and Gladiator.
","I have become a great fan of M Knight over the years. Of his four films since the Sixth Sense and including it he has stunned me with his imagery and his ability to make a film ultimately look and feel real. His staple plot twists are what has made him a box office success, but ultimately you cannot watch a Knight film without feeling like you have been somewhere. The Village (to me his best film to date) is not exception.While one of the two major plot twists in this film can be seen from miles away, this does not take anything away from the film. In fact all the while why you think you have figured out the twist you are ignoring the other hints that lead to the final twist. I think Knight knew this all along and sacrificed one for the protection of the other, to me that is genius. However, I think it is ignorant if not just plain ridiculous to critique any film on it's plot twist and whether or not you can figure it out before the film maker reveals it. The Usual Suspects is still a great film almost a decade after finding out who Keyser Soze really was. The Sixth Sense was a great film and I figured out Bruce Willis' secret before it was ever revealed in the film. Let's not forget that Hollywood is the reason why we look for plot twists in every film. Knight did not overkill the 'plot twist', nor did Brian Singer, and nor did O'Henry. The fact that in the last seven or so years at least thirty percent of the films released had plot twists from Basic to Taking Lives to Fight Club to Secret Window to In The Cut, it has been one plot twist after another. Don't blame Knight, blame Hollywood.The Village looks wonderful, and has a very fairy tale esquire feel that even Tim Burton couldn't pull off with double the budget. The is superb all around, and there is a feeling of freedom and innocence throughout the film, something few films do these days. There isn't any sex, language, and the violence is extremely mild. Knight creates his atmosphere with great set designs, amazing sounds, and superb acting. As a film in full this is a wonderful film not to be forgotten. Knight to me is the Steven Spielberg of this generation a man with a unlimited imagination, who reads people with the camera, and who is not afraid to tell a tale without gimmicks like nudity, sex, language, and violence. In this day and age where movies like Fast and The Furious dominate the box office with sex, sleaze, stupid unbelievable stunts, ridiculous Tarrentino challenges language, dumb plots, and horrible acting Knight should be a breath of fresh air to both critics and to movie fans.I for one can't wait for the next one from M Knight.Nine out of ten crows fed as an offering to Those We Don't Speak Of.",9,0,0,17 January 2005
Face_Off," Why would anyone want to wear the face of a bad actor like Nick Cage?
","Oh Boy!  This one is about 3 months past ripe!  You need a gas mask or an on hand ambulance to make it all the way through this one.  John Travolta goes from Pulp Fiction to this, how dumb. Nicholas Cage, everybody's favorite rusty robot, plays another bad role. Well, maybe it's the role that plays a bad actor.  Either way, as expected this film sucked like a giant Hoover vacuum hose in a tornado.  Nicholas Cage as expected, chewed on his tongue and babbled a lot of lunacy, while casting expressions that made me want to jump into the screen to check for his pulse. The question remains, Why do people love Nicholas Cage?  If this were Shakespearean times Nicholas Cage would be lucky to get a job playing the witch's cauldron in Macbeth.  The guy casts an aura that has only been rivaled by gravel and asphalt.  Satan if you are out there, enquiring minds want to know how many films you gave Cage for his soul?  When will we be rid of the violent, putrid stench that is Nicholas Cage?  Most importantly, is hell an eternity of Nicholas Cage films?  If so, maybe that is all preachers need to focus on to scare the Jesus into people.",4,1,3,24 April 2003
The Evil Dead," Senseless, Ridiculous, and Awesome!
","This film is madness wrapped up in a good insane egg roll.  The best description I could give is 'Evil Dead' is the Three Stooges meet in a old Horror comic mag from the early 60s.   This film is a pure entertaining masterful achievement.  Nothing more ridiculous, senseless, and amusing has ever been put on film.Evil Dead:  '9 out of 10 crows stabbed by sharp, penetrating branches!'",Null,0,1,24 April 2003
Reservoir Dogs," Black Comedy at its best!
","This film is brilliant with the best biting black humor I have seen since Scarface.  The brilliance of this film is that it could have doen just as well as a stage show.  This is a 100% dialogue driven actor's dream.  The film began the career of brilliant film maker Quentin Tarrentino, and a long over due national obsession with Independent Film.",10,1,5,23 February 2003
Con Air," Planes, Cage, and Automobiles? Cage with a fake southern accent
","A real hoot!Cage is at his best sucking! (He comes complete with King Fu grip and a Southern accent that's about as convincing as Elton John would be  playing a non-flambouyant straight man.)  Why does Nick keep popping up in films.  I would much rather seeing a real bad acting artist like Keanu Reeves than some arrogant prick who the world of Hollywood claims is one of it's best, but in all actuality is more dull than the tip of Sponge.There's plenty of realistic action.  Wait that's another film.I do think that Buscemi and Malcovich play well with their highly entertaining characters.  But the story of this film is Nick Cage's dialogues sounding like a Tennessee Walking Horse chewing on Emu Dung.This film sucked like newborn baby on his first bottle.",5,1,3,25 March 2003
Halloween," Carpenter's classic. One of the scariest ever!
","Of the slasher films in series 'Halloween' is the best all around series. Of the stand alone first films 'Halloween' is the best as well. It is visually haunting with a well made killer, who is believable.  Jaime Lee Curtis is remarkable.  Donald Pleasance gives a great performance as well.   The fact that this film succeeds even today in the terror/fright factor is astounding.  Not to mention that this film was made for so little of a budget.

Cube," Modern Sci Fi finally gets my attention!
","This is one of those films I have heard alot about but because of it's genre, I always found something else to watch instead.  For the most part modern Sci-Fi has fallen flat.  By modern, I mean post Aliens, Enemy Mine, and John Carpenter's: The Thing.  However I finally caught this one on a late Friday Night playing on IFC.  I was astonished.  The tense nature of this film is quite unparalleled to films of recent memory.  The nemesis is unknown and the purpose of it is unknown.  This may turn off a few viewers but this film basically says, ok they don't know what the Cube is, they don't know why it is, and neither should you.  It is strange how Hollywood feels we need to know Who?, What?, Where?, and Why?, in every film.   What is the point? There are alot of everyday situations that go on in normal life that do not answer that question.  That is why I applaud this metaphorical middle finger at Hollywood filming.  This film is a hidden gem and worth picking up.  I wish I had been in on the gag when it first appeared, but with films like this I do not mind being a late bloomer.",10,8,15,22 February 2003
Braveheart," The greatest epic ever filmed!
","While there are a lot of sweeping epics that have and always will stand the test of time (Spartacus, Gone With The Wind, Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments, etc.) few will hold that 100% entertainment value along with the intellect that can satisfy the most cynical of cynics like 'Braveheart'.   This film is perhaps the best 'Movie' that Hollywood has done since it's golden age.  Not a shock, considering it's director and star (Mel Gibson) is the most non-Hollywood celebrity in Hollywood.  He has spent most of his career as a soft spoken gentlemen, and when he has taken the opportunity to speak out Hollywood shuns his opinions.  (Yeah!  goes to show how well Hollywood loves the 1st amendment, 'Only when it applies to the corporate Hollywood masses.') 'Braveheart' is a beautiful and brilliant portrait and story.  While many argue on how true the film stays to the 'real'  William Wallace, I say whether this film is biographic or a fictional work, it dazzles with brilliance.  It deserved so much more than it won at the Academy Awards. Then again, however I think the Academy was bitter because Gibson wasn't wearing his red ribbon.  BRAVEHEART:   10 of 10 dead!  It's that simple.",10,1,3,24 April 2003
True Romance," True Romance, 'YOU'RE SO COOL!'
","There has never been a film that I have felt more passionate about.  True Romance is the film that got me into film.  This is the film that showed me the difference between gloss and substance.  I remember seeing this film at the age of 15 and from that point on I was hooked.  I rented it several times before finding a used copy for sale.  I have recently purchased the special edition DVD, and I am again hooked.There are some films that people claim to have seen 100 times.  Well, I have more of a life than that.  I have seen more films than most people.  It is only a few select that I have seen more than once or twice.  'True Romance' on the other hand I have seen enough to recite every line at will, whenever and wherever.  I can visualize it frame by frame. Before most people were getting to know Quentin with Pulp Fiction, and the post PF re-urge of interest in Reservoir Dogs, I was spouting out Tarrentino dialogue with my friends from True Romance.  My favorite lines being 'You know what we have here?  A m----- f----- Charlie Bronson. Mr Majestik.' , 'Do I look like a blonde with big t--s and an a-- that tastes like French Vanilla ice dream?' and 'I knew something must be rotten in Denmark.  I mean, I can't tell you how relieved I was when you took off your clothes, you didn't have a d---.'That's not to mention what I consider to be the single best piece of dialogue and cinematography in film history, (The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper).  That scene includes my all time 'Badass' comment of all time.  'I'm the anti-christ.  You got me in a vendetta kind of mood. Tell the angels in heaven, you've never seen evil so singularly  personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you.'The cast is tremendous.  The characters are all stand outs.  The performances are brilliant.  The dialogue is realistic and intelligent.  The cinematography is breath taking to recognizable.  The directing job is flawless.  'True Romance'  all in all is the only film, in which I have been 100% satisfied with the production.  If ever a perfect film were made other than Citizen Kane, it was True Romance.  (For all you CK fans I am not comparing the two or lumping them in.  I am simply making a statement.) True Romance:  '10 crows out of 10 killed.  Then I reloaded and looked for another one.  He died as well.  Making this my only 11 out of 10.  Because you see I shot to of the crows with one bullet.  I killed the 11th with the 10th round.'",10,0,2,24 April 2003
Gladiator," Period pieces can suck too?!?!?
","Emperor vs. Gladiator in a battle to the death.  Live Sunday, Sunday, Sunday at The Collesium.  Come one, come all.  Price of admission will not be refunded if this film sucks.Oh My Holy God, why couldn't you inspire this man Ridley (Riddle me a munch ass) Scott, to make a film that makes sense?  What is this supposed to be?Russell Crowe what did you do?  Mr. Romper Stomper, Mr. L.A. Confidential? Why God Why?Hey I got an idea let's make a modern version of this film.Let's get President Bush in a steel cage against That serial sniper guy. That seems like a logical thing for a man of great political power to do. 
Oh My God!Is this the end?Why did Maximus die?  Why did he have to die?  Oh this is tragic?  Nothing has been more tragic in film history since Earnest bumped his head in 'Earnest Scared Stupid'.This is a tragedy.  Let's bite each others toe nails and give this an Academy Award.(applause)Wait I meant for Best Puketure not Best Picture.Why does this keep happening.To be continued...with Ridley Scott's next bomb!!!!!!",4,0,1,23 February 2003
Donnie Darko," What?!?!?
","Ok, I know there are going to be a great amount that tell me 'Man, you just didn't get it!  The film is over yoru head!'  Well they would be right.  I am sick of films being made for the sole purpose of trying to pull off a Keyser Soze!   I will give the film credit on atmosphere and the 'Evil Dead' cameo. Other than that this film was a flop.  I undestand the basic plot, but I am not a fan of scientific BS.  I usually don't warm up to science fiction, but at least science fiction has the integrity to let the viewer understand the fiction part.  This film, however actually tries to make us believe that things that don't happen could happen.   I understand most of you are gonna defend it saying that it is meant to be taken fictionally, but I am sorry any film that chooses science as a tool for rebellion has simply lost touch with reality.  Here in Donnie Darko, that is what we have.  The plot is science versus whomever is content. Well, factually I think the world needs to be a little more apathetic to what we can do, because in the end everything we do is just everything we have done.  There is no honor in pointless scientific advances.  Especially when the science world is still divided on the idea of 'Monkey Man Evolution'.  Here's a little pointer you can't get from point A to point C without point B.  Point B is a missing link and so is the gap between Monkey and Man.   Science weirdos get a life and quick feeding us garbage like this trash can flick and others such as 'The Matrix'.  All these films are, is 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' with a bigger budget.",3,2,4,16 February 2003
Beetlejuice," Creative and Humorous!
","This is one of Tim Burton's first feature films, and it is still among his best.  With Beetlejuice, we are introduced into the wonderful vision and story telling of a man who has now become the most original and entertaining film maker in Hollywood. Michael Keaton gives his finest comedic performance, while Alec Baldwin (A man with such a dry and boring personality that he seems dead.) gives an almost biographical performance.  Wynona Ryder is a stand out, excluding Keaton.  The film is both wacky and outrageous.  It rates a 10 on the entertainment level.  What is more important however, is that 'Beetlejuice' will stand the test of time and be one of the most memorable comedies of it's time.Beetlejuice:  '9 crows dead out of 10.'",10,1,3,24 April 2003
