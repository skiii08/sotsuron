Deepwater Horizon," one of the best movies of the year
","To start off with this movie has some amazing acting, the job that was done building the characters up to make you care about them and get them to touch your heart is amazing.The job of creating the rig was very good, you felt you were getting to know the rig and where everything was in relation to how it worked and operated.The story that was told was truly horrific, this was not just telling a story but telling the story with the emotions and hardship that happened on that terrifying day, it was pulled off to perfection.Overall the film tells the story in dramatic depth and made you feel the emotions you would expect from the situation that was happening on the rig.",10,4,7,9 October 2016
Suicide Squad," Misses a lot of key aspects
","The build up to this movie was very good to see, it had me and all my friends very excited to see it, however the anticipation left us with a bad taste in our mouths once the movie was over. The story was very poorly written, you felt lost from time to time trying to keep up with what was happening. The characters were OK but harley quinn was pushed as being sexy rather then actually so concentrating on the character which they should have concentrated on. The action was OK but again was rushed and the climax to the movie was not good enough for a film that built it up so much All in all it was OK but people that go in with a open mind like me will feel it was nothing special, people with high anticipation for the film will feel very let down",5,0,1,11 August 2016
Furious 7," possibly the best movie in the franchise
","so with fast 7 came the biggest budget yet but also the biggest anticipation yet and the acting did not disappoint. The chemistry between the actors was near perfect and the film flowed well thanks to this. The use of Jason statham could have been better and Dwayne Johnson was also widely underused. The fighting scenes did become a little too fast at times to understand what they were doing and this scores against the film.Getting into the story and we know its going to be about furious toretto and fast cars but the story seemed a little lost sometimes in the need for more action and you find yourself thinking what is the need for this, a simple story got made complicated for no reason.Let me be honest, this film looked astonishing in what they pulled off, some of the scenes were edge of your seat fingernail biting worthy, this film is not about realism, its about coolness and the way some sciences played out were breathtaking.So overall this film has amazing acting, breathtaking scenes and offers you with amazing entertainment, definitely worth your money",8,75,95,20 April 2015
