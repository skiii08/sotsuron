Alien 3," Not worth your time
",When the director walks away from the project cause he himself hated it you know its a flop.I got nostalgic cause I had only seen the first alien film and decided watch the second and then this film over the past week.All I can say is I was very disappointed. If you are thinking about watching 3 just dont. Let the first two movies still hold the magic.,2,1,2,3 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Star wars is dying
",8.6 8.8 8.3 Thats the original trilogy. This 7.2 and thats all you need to know.,5,8,12,3 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Not an 8.0
",This is merely due to the fact this movie rides on the sentimental value of real fans. Without that it has done nothing new*death star 3.0 anyone?* Main character is the literal dictionary definition of a mary sue and has no character developement. Fin is next he has a little bit of developement but its uncovincing and boyega im sorry to say didnt do very well acting this role*neither did daisy tbh*. Its just the hole thing thing feels like its some fan made movie which can be good but never great. Id maybe put this above the prequels but thats merely for the special affects. I personally like the story line of the prequels much more than this. Also Star wars the clone wars is coming back!!! Dave Filoni is director!!! Seriously this is the last thread on the rope keeping star wars from falling to a firery.,5,4,4,3 September 2018
