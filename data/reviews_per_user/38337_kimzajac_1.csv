Hereditary," Not a horror movie
","I so wanted to believe the hype. It promised to be so much more than it is. The first part of the film played as a very slow burning and heartbreaking drama. It needed a great deal of editing. It seemed as though a second 'horror' part of it was added on as an afterthought. The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. Very disjointed story and an absolute letdown if you go in expecting to be frightened (which is what I mistakenly did). If it had been marketed as an intense drama, I would be less frustrated.I gave it a 3 because I thought the acting was quite good, the cinematography was well done, and I was creeped out for about 10 minutes of the film. I feel shortchanged after believing all the hype. I wanted to go into the movie without biased expectations, so I didn't read any reviews beforehand. I really wish I had, because I would have waited for Netflix.",3,8,17,10 June 2018
