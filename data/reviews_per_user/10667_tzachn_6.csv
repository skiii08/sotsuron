The Equalizer," DDD - Denzel Doesn't Disappoint!
","Anyone who is expecting some groundbreaking genre-defining stuff here, don't. It's your standard, traditional 'One man against the world' scenario here. But Denzel manages to turn it around to an emotional, partially psychological thriller like no other actor does.What you get is a calculated, precise, tailored, fast-paced textbook action flick that is simply well made, and satisfies the viewer in almost every way.Soundtrack and sound effects are bingo and Denzel's character is wrapped with mystery along with an intelligent and intellectual dialog that manages to surprise even in moments that scream for the well known occasional clich√© phrases.In summary, if you're looking for a good action title that will also challenge your mind a bit in addition to keeping you on the edge of your seats, watch The Equalizer.",8,0,3,12 January 2015
Skyfall," Boring, plain and expected...
","Hard to believe that the hype of this movie pulled out an 8.1 out of nowhere.This movie is quite simply put, boring. It starts off nice with a few twists in the plot that makes you raise one eyebrow, but sure enough, they disappear quickly and the movie becomes very expected.The plot on its own is interesting yet it is executed poorly and it does not reveal everything you expect to find out based on the facts you receive.The highlight of the movie which is so recognized with the James Bond series was missing and you could not figure out where and when the movie reaches its peak. It's simply a flatliner.Special effects are cheap and the soundtrack was terrible. The only performance worth mentioning is that of Javier Bardem who plays Mr. Silva. He managed to get the most out of the cheesy text and the plot.I'm used to sitting at the edge of my seat during Bond movies, but unfortunately, that feeling was missing here and I found myself staring at the screen without much excitement for most of the movie.This production feels very rough around the edges and it lacks the style and chic that the series is known for.To sum it up, I'll give it a 5 mostly for the beginning of the movie, a few good scenes in the middle and for Javier Bardem's performance, however, you can pass on this movie without caring too much.Rather disappointed.",5,5,13,6 November 2012
Gone Baby Gone," A mind twisting ending to a shape shifting story line creates a fantastic, mysterious, emotional thriller.
","This movie is hands down, one of the best I've ever seen. I just finished watching it and even though I'm 5 years late I just had to write a review about this.The plot of this movie could so easily bu turned into a dull, simple, boring action movie, however, the selection of characters, the great soundtrack and the great acting makes this a masterpiece.I found myself supporting every character at some point of the movie only to get my head turned around into disagreeing with them as the movie progressed.Casey Affleck steals this movie with his touching performance. At times a loose cannon, at others, a compassionate catholic, contemplating right and wrong. Ed Harris as always provides some of the best peak action moments as Morgan Freeman maintains his dark, quiet role behind the shadows.The movie really manifests the nature of Boston. The people, the accents, the old bars, the drugs, you actually feel as if you're strolling down the blocks, investigating every lead that comes to your mind. The actors were very authentic and everything seemed so natural, as if you were actually watching what's happening as a bystander. This is far more than just a story about a kidnapping, it is a struggle between the forces of darkness and light, a fight between right and wrong, and the ending will haunt for a while after you finish watching it, thinking about what you would have done to handle the situation.Must not be missed, as said, one of the best movies I've seen to date with an absolutely intense, mysterious and thrilling plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire time.Easiest 10 I've ever given to a movie.",10,1,2,27 September 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The Expected Virtue of Originality
","Let me just start by saying that this movie is SO NOT over hyped or overrated. It's one of the most original titles I've seen in years, and it boasts an impressive, cheeky cast of great actors who don't disappoint.First of all the scene transitions are just spectacular, you feel as if you're being drifted into the living heart and soul of the Broadway theaters, the living, pumping urban feeling of the streets of NYC and the personal lives of almost every character with ease.Rigan Thomson is an ex superhero called 'Birdman' who is trying to free himself from the chains of commercial comic books movie productions and prove the world he is more than a man in a suit, but an actor. His character is intense, deep and multi layered and completely explodes on the scenes. As the movie unfolds you start going into his relationships and see what is actually driving him to go out there and prove himself and Michael Keaton does a great job at that.Emma stone playing Rigan's daughter is a complete scene stealer, she's intriguing, hot headed yet sensitive and a little out there, which is amazing to watch. She has some of the best dialogs in the film and provides great moments. The rest of the cast, Edward Norton in particular was great as well on all parts.Soundtrack is great, packed with drums, bass, snares that all give the feel of the marquee lights and coupled with great shooting - a very impressive visual presentation.The movie also boasts some extremely surreal moments which are manifested wonderfully using the theater's complex, almost maze like structure, lighting and color use is fantastic as well.The film is fast, it's funny, it's weird and it's fascinating at once, and it's surely one to keep you talking about when you exit the movie theater.In summary it should not be missed, and has to be watched with an open mind. 9/10",10,2,11,5 February 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," Immense, Empowering, Psychological, Groundbreaking, Legendary.
","'The Dark Knight' was my favorite movie of the 2 last decades, up until yesterday, when I watched 'The Dark Knight Rises'.This movie delivers a cinematic experience like I've never watched before. Photography is absolutely genius and the sense of scale is unreal. The casting is a collection of hand picked professional actors who do their job perfectly, it is simply brilliant. Christian Bale, as always, does not disappoint as Bruce Wayne nor as Batman and manages to keep the 2 characters separated while portraying Wayne as a very fragile, sentimental person who lost the love of his life on the one hand and a patriotic, cunning, powerful Batman on the other, great performance.Anne Hathaway is golden, as said. Her physical capabilities are impressing but her ability to catch the viewer's eye is even better, her facial expressions, gestures and slick tongue make her an absolute joy to watch.Tom Hardy as Bane is, hands down, one of the best villains ever seen on the screen. (I will avoid comparing his appearance to Ledger's legendary Joker as the 2 are very different)Immediately when appearing on the screen, Bane induces a sense of chaos, terror and brutality while keeping an absolute crisp, logical and articulate tongue, it was just an experience to watch him bend everything to his advantage, not always having to use his terrifying physique, but also his brilliant mind and intelligence. Just wonderful.Michael Cane is simply one of the best actors alive today and should be nominated for an academy award for his outstanding appearance in this film, nothing more is needed to be said.The plot of this film is just brilliant and although Bane and the Joker are very different, it feels like at some points Bane actually tries to fulfill the Joker's vision in spreading chaos everywhere, but in a much more intelligent way.The texts are brilliant, saturated with philosophical and psychological meanings and it truly feels like every scene is extremely important to understand the entire trilogy and the chronicles of Batman and Gotham.This movie strikes a perfect balance between hi-tech, fast paced, precise action scenes and engrossing, deep, meaningful events and texts.The Photography and the sense of scale this movie provides left me in awe, the soundtrack was impeccable and the editing was spot on.I am running out of adjectives to commend this movie enough.To summarize, I will recommend everyone to watch this movie, even twice in order to absorb the entire experience to its fullest.'The Dark Knight Rises' is a huge collision between a deep, intelligent, psychological plot to stunning photography, brilliant editing and outstanding acting performance who together create a legendary cinematic experience.Without a shred of doubt, this is Nolan's best work to date and it absolutely deserves the title 'Best Film of the year'10/10",7,4,10,23 July 2012
Heat," Possibly the best Crime Thriller movie ever made...
","This movie sits firmly on my top 10 movies of all time, for several key reasons.It features 2 of the best actors ever to have walked on this planet, and is a worthy 'sequel' to their previous on-screen performance from the Godfather 2.It manages to brilliantly captivate the viewer and give great depth to almost every character even if they are minor. The dialog is simply sharp and highly intelligent, especially the scenes between Pacino (Vincent) and his wife Justine. De Niro (Neil) gives his best performance on screen ever seen. Val Kilmer is also dark and mysterious, yet surprisingly calm and composed.This is not a fast paced action flick that's all about gun fights and explosions. It takes its time to build the atmosphere, lays the ground, the action scenes are calculated and well thought, the soundtrack is brilliant, it features some great psychological moments of suspense that keep you on the edge of your seat, particularly the scene where Vincent and Neil meet face to face and the great ending of course. While the movie is about crime at its heart, it also has strong characteristics of excellent drama and manages to surprise with it's outstanding dialog, you get to dig a little deeper into the characters and get involved in their personal life in a way that's different than most other movies, it's quite hard to explain and needs to be experienced as you watch. And while it's well known who the criminals are, the script invests so much time into building and developing the characters in such a way that you as the viewer will have a hard time figuring out who's the good guy and who's the bad guy, emotionally speaking of course.While significantly more modern, Heat sits right up there with great crime titles like The Godfather, The Usual Suspects & Goodfellas and in my opinion may well be the best Crime Thriller movie ever made.In summary, this is a must watch.10/10",10,0,3,25 January 2015
