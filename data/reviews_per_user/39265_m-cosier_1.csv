Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Crude and not at all witty
","I used to like Borat and Ali G. Not any more. This film was downright crude and full of toilet humour. The moments of political satire (something Sacha Baron Cohen is well known for) were few and far between. Borat, what happened to you? It was not AT ALL what I expected. The film was just provocative for the sake of being provocative, and nothing more.I can fully understand Kazachstan's reaction to the film. In the past, the character of Borat was used to highlight the worst facets of the American (and sometimes British) culture. The focus, in the past, was never on Kazachstan itself. In the movie, however, there is too little focus on America and too much focus on Kazachstan.",2,11,23,5 November 2006
