The Rock," ' This Man is the one individual who knows all the secrets of the Cold War '
","The island known as ' The Rock ' is the one prison where no inmate has ever managed to escaped from. The fact is, one escape was successful and the vanished prisoners have never been caught. Immitating history, this incredible movie too has escaped the enormous accolades and noteworthy praise it should have received. Not only for the sheer star power is contained, but for the incredible excitement it generated in audiences across the country. The story is of a remarkable and dedicated but now renegade U.S. general (Ed Harris) who has managed to obtain some extremely dangerous and definitely lethal toxin. Together, with the help of a loyal group of U.S. Marines, is holding some civilian hostages on that imprisoned island. The general demands The F.B.I director (John Spencer) and other U.S. authorities to pay $100 million dollars in reparations to the dead soldiers's families who have never been told how they died or even recognized for their ultimate bravery. Unable to admit their country's deception, the authorities instead send in a S.E.A.L team to destroy the general and his men. Accompanying the SEAL Team is a former inmate (Sean Connery) of Alcatraz and a chemical weapons's specialist (Nicolas Cage) to rescue the hostages. The movie is a vivid action packed thrill ride filled with high drama and suspense. The excellent cast and splendid car chase scenes, together with jet fighters and a fiery explosive finale makes for a true Classic. Easily recommended. ****",9,2,3,30 April 2010
The Blair Witch Project," Where's The Witch?
","If ever there was a film which had the ability to promise so much and deliver so little, this would be it. This was a film which did better promoting itself than it did delivering its supposed frightening contents. The culprits for this film fiasco are listed as Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams. From the prospective of a common boy scout these supposedly 'College' students made every mistake as could be made by even the most stupid junior cub-scouts. Their purpose was to travel, via outdoors backpacking to the legendary ghost site of the famous Blair Witch and to ascertain her possible authenticity. As the viewer travels along with them, one wonders if they left their brains in neutral or just back in their dorms. Even Gilligan would not have been that dumb to carry out their own demise, not from the confrontation of the Witch, but with their own ignorance. The police should have bagged this one as death by stupidity. If there was ever a film which audiences should be warned about not seeing, this is the best candidate for that job. It does not even rate one star.",1,12,22,20 October 2006
Moneyball," ' It's a game, that's plays for money, not the love of the sport, that only counts if you're a youngster '
","In the late 19th century, a baseball team was introduced to a up-and-coming young America as pastoral fun and leisure entertainment. However, someone from a rival town took to betting on that unimportant, non-descriptive game and promised to return with a better-team. That created a rivalry and up sprang a dozen teams all believing their's was the best. Fast forward to the present and anyone with a T.V. can see a baseball game being plays with a variety of teams, players and managers earning vast sums of money. Records and statistics are kept, revamped and stored, none of which can add one ray of sunshine to the original pastoral intent. This movie staring Brad Pitt is called ' Moneyball. ' It tells the story of Billy Beane (brad Pitt) who is a General Manager told by the owner that he is charged to create a winning baseball team with the funds already allocated to him. Despite his pleas for additional monies, none are forthcoming. Forced to accept that, he decides to hire Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a statical researcher who believes the best way to win is to select players based on accumulated untapped statistics. Upon assembling said team, they are primed to win games, but are prevented by Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an old style coach who does not believe it's the way to run a team. Thus, it's a test of wills and therein lies the heart of this movie. In addition to his on the field problems is Beane's personal life and his growing teenage daughter. The film is a reminder of what's important, the game or the money? For the audience, it's a reminder of what becomes important to a man, his family or what he does to it? Something to remember when seeking a fun game. ****",7,1,2,13 February 2012
The Avengers," ' I Believe this special group is the best chance to save Mankind '
","From the active and resilient mind of Marvel writer Stan Lee comes this incredible offering called ' The Avengers.

Angels & Demons," ' When you write about us and you will write about us, be kind as we are human '
","If you have read the dubious source which has become the basis for the movie ' The Da Vinci Code ' and this second addition which emerges as ' Angels and Demons ', you'll quickly realize the intricate nature of Ron Howard, the director. Having read the book, then watched the movie, I see the enormous segments of the literary track, were left out. Howard is a great director, as proof is seen in his past work. In this film however, there is a great deal lacking. Though it's not as complex as his 'Code' which drags the audience across countries, this one has the befuddled audience racing around Vatican city itself. Tom Hanks returns as Professor Robert Langdon a cryptologist who did not ingratiate himself with the Rome see in the first film, is reluctantly recalled by the same church to help solve the latest threat which calls itself the Illuminati. This secret group has kidnapped four important cardinals and promises to murder them for past sins of the church against the Intellectals brutalized in the past. Nikolaj Lie Kaas plays the assassin who stays well ahead of Hanks and physicist Vittoria Vetre (Ayelet Zurer) and Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård). With the complexity of a Physics problem, the movie is entertaining enough if you like crowds, racing sequences and threats of final annihilation. There is gratuitous drama, character suspense, combined with double and triple double-crossing, so much so one forgets who is fighting whom. As a result, this is an exciting movie for those who seek to leave the theater with heads spinning. But having read Dan Brown's juvenile books, they are baffling enough and it's not necessary to see his cryptic suggestions on the silver screen. ***",8,1,2,25 November 2009
Changeling," ' For your terrible crime, you have earned a special place in Hell '
","In 1928, in Riverside county, California, a cold, dispassionate, demented and brutally insane serial killer named Gordon Northcott (Jason Buttler Harner) amasses a string of some twenty kidnappings, molestations and murders of young boys. His eventual arrest, capture and trial became National news, leading to his conviction. This extraordinary film is called ' Changeling ' and is based in part on the true events of the time, including the abduction of Walter Collins (Gattlin Griffith). The crime also lead to a direct investigation of the Los Angeles Police Department. Their ambivalent attitudes and corruption charges would eventually lead to the dismissal of Police Chief James Davis (Colm Feore), Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) and several other police Officers. The movie's heroes include Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), Dectective Lester Ybarra (Michael Kelly) and Rev. Gustav Briegleb (John Malkovich). Together they expose the single minded effort of the police to convince Mrs. Collins that her kidnapped son was found and returned to her. However, the police are mistaken when they believe the case has been solved, as Mrs. Collins is not convinced the boy is her son. Waging a non-stop war with the police, the medical doctors and their cronies, she becomes a force to be reckoned with, despite being ignored, arrested, jailed and confined to a mental Instituation. The movie and all it's tragedy is perhaps a great tribute to Clint Eastwood (Director) in filming what for many is an incredible and unbelievable story of horror and disbelief. Yet when one sees the final product, there is little doubt, Eastwood and his cast has created a Classic. Touching and dramatically sensational, this movie is recommended to any seeking the great effort it takes to fight City Hall. ****",8,3,5,24 January 2010
Men in Black 3," ' When chasing yourself through time, the question is, , ,do I ever want to catch up? '
","The Men from the Top secret Organization are back in this new film called ' Men in Black III' and I mean Way, , ,back. Directed by Barry Sonnenfel this story was written by Etan Cohen. It seems a dangerous creature called Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) has escaped incarceration on a maximum prison planet and has a most diabolic plan to travel back in time to get even with the man who put him in prison. Will Smith returns as Agent J and Tommy Lee Jones reprises his role as Agent K with Josh Brolin playing a younger version of himself. Audience members have to pay close attention to this action oriented, fun-filled caper as the agents have to chase themselves through time, hoping that they can remember enough to save themselves and the world. The movie is exciting in more ways than one. What with super gadgets and speed travel in multiple frames of history to deal with, this movie unravels at the speed of excitement. For eye-candy we are offered Emma Thompson as Agent O and plenty of recoil as the movie progresses. All in all, this is a good film with heart touching scenes as friendship is put on the line. Great comeback for the principals. ****",7,1,5,16 June 2012
Scarface," ' Want to play rough? . . . then say hello to my little friend '
","Growing up I had many a favorite movie. One of them was the 1932 drama entitled 'scarface' with Paul Muni. I enjoyed it so much, I saw it twenty-two times. It was incredible. However, went I visited the theater to see this updated version, also called 'Scarface' this time with Al Pacino, I was astonished and completely stunned by this remake. I should not have been surprised at it's electrifying performances because Brian De Palma stacked it with star power. In this explosive story we are given a young and utterly ruthless Cuban immigrant named Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who aims for the top of the drug world and will destroy anyone who stands in his way. To help him in his rise for power is his close friend and partner named Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer), who should have remembered, if you side with the devil, you will get burned. Others who join Tony's meteoric rise to power are Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham, associates who feed Tony's appetite for power, begin as friends then become obstacles. Tony Montana shares many stock features with dictators. He is bold, daring and most of all fearless. Unfortunately, like all maniacal men of power he forgets the most important quality necessary to remain in power, vigilance. This is something he fails to maintain as he also tragically discovers, his love for his sister, may not be platonic. If you like brutal explosive violence in films, this one may become a favorite for you too. ****",9,4,9,8 August 2007
Frost_Nixon," ' Crime? When the President Does it, . . .It's legal '
","Throughout the history of the Presidency, there is but one man who was dishonorably forced to resign his job; Richard M. Nixon. Although no deal was suppose to have been made between Nixon and Gerald R. Ford, the first act President Ford carried out was to pardon his predecessor for a crime, he insisted he did not commit. In this film called ' David Frost Interviews Richard Nixon ' English Talk-show Host, David Frost, seizes a great opportunity to boost his ratings and secure several new TV shows, by arranging to interview the former Man in the White House. David Frost (Michael Sheen) plays Himself and is less convincing than his flaunted screen image. For this movie, Richard Nixon is played by exceptional actor Frank Langella, who does a remarkable job of playing the self-centered, egotistical and politically conniving ex-Congressman from California. The interview itself is fraught with planned attacks and defenses on both sides, each seeking to score points with the T.V. audiences watching across the country. Frost and Nixon hope their real motives for the Interview displays more style, than substance. Yet, after watching the entire movie, one believes there could have been more secured than ethereal coronets and self pity. The highlight of the film leans towards Langella when emotion, not confrontation becomes the final victory. This is one movie which should be seen by History and Political Science students in every school dealing with Watergate and Presidential authority. ****",8,4,6,16 March 2010
Howl's Moving Castle," Fire, Magic and a boy's heart
","From the Island of Japan comes this incredible story of an enchanted and magical castle. A young girl, named Sophi is bewitched and accidentally encapsulated into a traveling fortress. Unaware her brief meeting with a handsome and powerful wizard prince, will enrage the Witch of the Waste, Sophie is thus drawn into the struggle to find a lasting peace to a ongoing war. The story is interesting to be sure, but the animation and picturesque scenery add more than enough action and drama to offset traditional venues. Within the film are the talented voices of Jean Simmons and Emily Mortimer as the voice of Sophie, Christian Bale as Howl, the Bird Prince, Lauren Bacall as the Witch of the Waste, Blythe Danner as Madame Suliman, the Sourceress. Josh Hutcherson as Markl and of course Billy Crystal is terrific as Calcifer, the Fire Demon. This fine cast adds resilience to the inspirational tale as does the colorful and touching film. To anyone who enjoys children's stories which endure the test of time and mesmerize modern audiences, this is one for the complete library. A classic in the making. ****",8,5,7,3 May 2007
Lucky Number Slevin," ' Danger can arise from any Bad Dog, but mostly from the one you created '
","Our story began in the mind of writer Jason Smilovic and later directed well in the movie called ' Lucky Number Slevin ' by Paul McGuigan. It relates the story apparently initiated through mistaken identity. A traveler visiting a friend accepts an invitation to stay at an apartment in another city. Once there however, he meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu) a sexy next door neighbor, is slugged and mugged in broad daylight just before he is kidnapped and threatened with death if he doesn't pay a great debt and do a favor for The 'Boss', a local Godfather (Morgan Freeman). However, he also realizes, in order to fulfill the command, he must kill a total stranger for 'The Rabbi' a rival Godfather (Ben Kingsley). The reason for the duel threat dates back some twenty years and involves a professional Hit-man named Mr. Goodkat (Bruce Willis). The film is briefly confusing and further muddled if the audience doesn't pay close attention to the interesting players. Although a serious feature, the inclusion of dark comedy makes for a black situation which is flavored with fast action and hard hitting excitement. Josh Hartnett, plays Slevin Kelevra and holds his own against the heavyweight stars of the movie. All in all, an unexpected and wonderful movie recommended for the thinking audience. The result, . . . a Classic in the making. ****",9,14,19,6 September 2012
The Expendables 2," ' There comes a time in every life when memories are the best part '
","This movie was written for the screen by Richard Wenk and Slyvester Stallone, and directed by Simon West. The initial prowess of this film is Action. However, once into the movie the audience becomes aware that something is horribly missing. Halfway through it, one becomes aware of the missing element, youthful vitality. For the past twenty years or so, most of the primary stars in the film have established a solid reputation as an action Hero. The movie is called ' The Expendables ' and follows up on the Prequeal of nearly the same name. The story is action figure driven and set in the old Soviet Union territory where a hidden cache of enriched weapons' grade Plotonium has been discovered with a dangerous mercenary (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and his followers set to remove and sell it to the highest bidder. To stop such a sale C.I.A. Operative Mr. Church (Bruce Willis) extorts a group of highly trained though albeit 'older' and more expendable soldiers to stop them. The film is explosively dramatic with one explosive scene after another and the audience gets to see some of their favorite action stars performing again. Actor like Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Chuck Norris, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and even Jean-Claude Van Damme as the heavy all perform well. The movie, it's expansive settings, the shoot-em-up scenes are plausible and the acting is interesting and exciting, although a bit 'tonge and cheek.' Still for all it's apparent drawbacks the 'over the hill gang' gives a good account of itself and produces a good film. Recommended. ****",6,2,3,18 February 2013
Skyfall," ' He lives where all shadows live, . . . . in the Dark '
","This James Bond story was written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade. In addition it was superbly directed by Sam Mendes. From the onset this new Bond film awakens the audiences with wall-to-wall action. When describing a superior movie as this one is, it's easy when recalling the heart-thumping, hair-raising introduction. Taken nearly from today's headlines. Bond is seen in dangerous high-flying mid-action when he travels from country to country confronting the enemies of the Crown. Upon returning home to England his secret organization of MI6 is attacked with a great loss of life. Bond and his boss 'M' (Judi Dench) come under great political criticism and nearly put out to pasture. However, that's when Bond (Daniel Craig) is at his best. He now seeks to learn who the shadowy mole is and vows vengeance. There is much drama in this movie as the audience follows Bond into the complex labyrinth of espionage where everyone is suspect. New Bond characters are added and several add to the mystique and intrigue like the new 'Q' (Ben Whishaw) and Eve.(Naomie Harris. In all, one can look forward to an explosive and entertaining movie. Easilly recommended. ****",9,3,12,16 February 2013
Iron Man 3," ' Open the Closet and examine one of Twenty-five suits '
","The director of this film called: ' Iron Man 3 ' is Shane Black. Together with screen writer and Marvel comic Creator Stan Lee they surpass themselves. The movie proves to be an exciting, sky jaunting, world traveling explosion for the mind. The story continues the saga of handsome Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), who is a Billionaire and inventive genius. From the creative mind of Marvel comics, writer Stan Lee, comes this third segment of the Iron Man. In this chapter, we find Stark in a fitful state while his active mind is unable to allow his body to rest or sleep. As such he is ripe for an attack from his newest enemy called Mandarin ( Ben Kingsley) who promises to destroy Iron Man. The first attack is to Starks' Malibu home which Mandarin destroys with three guided missiles. Among all the things which Tony loses is his beautiful beach-side home, his girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and his wealth which leaves him destitute and homeless. Crashing on the ground in the state of Tennesse, Stark realizes he must start again. He does this with the help of Jarvis, (Paul Bettany) his Robotic aid, Harley Kenner (Ty Simpkins) an orphan boy who inspires Tony to rebuild himself and James Rhodes (Dom Cheadle) who reprises his role as his Military friend. Together they take on the International criminal called Manderin (Ben Kingsley) and his major henchman called Aldrich Killian. (Guy Pearce). The movie is filled with high drama, Damsel rescues, Presidential protection, high flying chills and thrills and explosive combat displays. The reckless pursuit of action scenes is what drives this movie. The cast which included Miguel Ferrer as Vice President Rodriguez is exceptional and lends itself to the complete foundation for a real exciting Classic. I fully recommend this movie to all movie fans and friends of Stan Lee. ****",8,20,33,3 October 2013
Spartacus," ' When one Slave says no! It's a victory. We were Tens of Thousands who said No! '
","The Slave Revolt of the year 71 B.C. was set to record by several Roman authors. The primary source was said to have been Plutarch, the Roman Historian. Now centuries later a masterful novel, written by Howard Fast and a spectacular film directed by Standley Kubrick, brings the ancient warrior hero ' Spartacus ' to life. Because the sketchy sources of his life and actual military accomplishments are so wrought with inaccuracies and speculation, much of it, serves only as a collection of supposition or historical conjecture. Still, with that as a foundation, the movie makers have done what they could in creating a viable film version of the man's life and death. Like many other Blockbuster movies, this story is packed with Hollywood superstars all jocking to be the most visible on the silver screen. Kirk Douglas plays Spartacus, the ancient Gladiator who refused to accept the yoke of slavery and caused all Rome to fear for it's safety and political republic. Laurence Olivier plays Crassus, the wealthy, autocratic and power hungry General who needed his Triumverate and Eight Roman legions to confront the Slave rebellion. Charles Laughton is Gracchus who tries to prevent Crassus from becoming a Dictator in Rome. Together with Tony Curtis, Woody Strode, Peter Ustinov, John Gavin, John Ireland, Herbert Lom and Charles McGraw as Marcellus create a monumental cast and a solid foundation of what has become a True Classic for all audiences. Very little is left to chance when we see the enormous effort which went into this magnificent version of the man and his slave army. Thus, despite the lack of historical accuracy, this movie allows modern audiences the chance at witnessing what would become a creative Tribune to a slave who would not bow to the might of Imperial Rome. Recommended to anyone wishing to see a Historical Classic for all time. ****",9,1,3,16 March 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," ' This nation cannot Exist, half Living and half Dead '
","Under the adroit and expert direction of Timur Bekmambetoy, the book indeed, the film, called ' Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter ' was written by Seth Grahame-Smith is shockingly and surprisingly good. Reluctant as I was to view the movie, I went nonetheless with an open mind. But being a historian, I was further skeptical of how one of the Finest Presidents this country ever had could be involved with Vampires. Still, I remained and watched with increasing fascination as the tale began amid the early frontier life of the 16th president of the U.S. It relates the saga of a centuries old Vampire who includes Lincolns' mother among his victims. Putting my prejudices aside, I sat with growing fascination as our hero is recruited to become a hunter of the undead. Through the length of the movie, I was mesmerized by the fantastic action sequences as well as the plethora of exciting scenes which involved a martial art, Axe-wielding chief executive against a plethora of blood drinking vampires. The cast is believable and includes Benjamin Walker and Lux Haney-Jardine as Abraham Lincoln with Dominic Cooper, Anthony Mackie and Elizabeth Winstead as Mary Todd Lincoln. In addition there are many special effects which combine to add credence to this modern but stylish horror story. In the end, I left the theater satisfied the film would rank above the ordinary and Worthy of the price of a ticket. All in all, though I was reluctant to see this movie, I admit, it was great and proof that you can't judge a film by it's teeth marks. I therefore recommend it to any in search of interesting entertainment. ****",9,3,6,21 November 2012
Finding Neverland," What Dreams are Made of
","The world of imagination as created by Sir James Matthew Barrie is solidly entrenched in both children books and in films such as 'Finding Neverland.' Viewing the superb acting talents of Johnny Depp, portraying the 19th century English writer J. M. Berrie, is tantamount to watching a great artist at work. The film laces Barrie's life before, during and after meeting his wife Kate Winslet, with the Victorian views of the day. What is glossed over or at the very least dissipated by the delicate film are the circulating rumors, societal suspicions and vicious gossip regarding Mr. Barries' real reason for marrying the matron widow and her attractive family. The film proves witty, incisive and stocked with family values seldom found in other movies. Anyone seeking a glimpse of turn-of-the-century England will enjoy Depp's performance as he reveals the inspirational origins for his memorable story of Peter Pan. **",4,3,6,3 February 2006
Chinatown," ' She's my Daughter, . ,. my Sister,... .My Daughter ... .My Sister...'
","Hollywood is one city which often wears more faces than the two it's noted for. Naturally, one face is more acceptable than the other. That face is innocence. Its hardly an innocent place, but to judge by its heavenly celluloid stories, it continues because audiences are suckers for them. Those faces are found in every splendid tale it creates. This movie is one of them. The film is called 'Chinatown.' It has been seen by many audiences because of is star. Jack Nicholson plays J.J. 'Jake' Gittes, a modest, but serious private eye who's every bit an old style gumshoe. In this episode he is hired by the wife (Faye Dunaway) of a city government employee to find out if her husband is cheating. With the help of his associates, he not only discovers the husband is not cheating, but also learns she is not really the man's wife. The real Mrs. Evelyn Mulray (Faye Dunaway) sues Gittes and promises legal action. Gittes begins to investigate and finds more than he sought, including murder, political corruption and a powerful organization, led by millionaire Noah Cross, (John Huston). His friend on the police force, Lieutenant Lou Escobar (Perry Lopez) warns him of the dangerous elements arrayed against him. One for instance is Roman Polanski who plays a vicious gangster, and is also the movie's director. Dunaway proves fantastic when cross examined and reveals a secret which should have remained undisturbed. In the end, we conclude that innocence is covered in a thin veneer for a reason. You don't really want to know the truth. Now where have we heard that before? ****",8,4,8,6 October 2007
Unbreakable," ' Everyone in the world should have a purpose, . . . . including me '
","If you are ever looking for a afternoon film which contains enough drama to keep you mesmerized, you have got to see this film. The premise of this movie is that people everywhere in the world are going about their busy little lives, trying to fit in. Yet from a more myopic perspective, there are some who believe they are being shunned, decide to prove they do have a purpose. Such is the task of this great director M. Night Shyamalan. He takes an ordinary man, named David Dunn, (Bruce Willis) who believes he is anything but and in events not of his doing begins to reexamine his mysterious existence. The impetus is not his but is initiated by a man called Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). Dunn is contacted by Price and told he is so important he must have a 'special' purpose, one which his wife has denied but seemingly is so extraordinary, he might be able to stop a bullet. A theory his son, Joseph Dunn (Spencer Treat Clark, superb acting) wants to put to the test. The story becomes intense and like a beautifully crafted comic, creates tension and drama to to point the viewer cannot dare to look away. When the picture continues to it's inevitable climax, adrenaline levels rise to it's peak and one cannot wait to learn the fate of all concern. A sequel is suspected for this fine, soon to become a classic film. ****.",9,2,3,10 October 2008
Star Trek," ' I have been and ever shall be your friend '
","There are several generations of Star-Trek fans out there and based on their refusal to 'Grow Up' will in all likelihood be more. Those of us who enjoy the original series and perhaps a couple of the movies, realize that despite all the effort to replicate the original dream, directors will never please everyone. This newest film entitled ' Star Trek ' is reasonably better than others in that the new cast is well selected. In this offering we have Bruce Greenwood as Captain Christopher Pike, the original Captain of the Enterprise. (Superior selection.) Chris Pine plays the young James T. Kirk, who is full of vim, vigor and enthusiasm. Zachary Quinto plays the early Spock, full of expectation, promise and definitely logical for the role. Karl Urban plays the erasable Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy. It seems they select the right man as he fits reluctantly into his role. Simon Pegg plays engineer, Montgomery Scott well and believable and I believe, James Doohan would have agreed. John Cho is the youthful Lt. Hikaru Sulu, the pilot and portrays him very and observably masculine. One wonders why? The navigator is the very young Russian Pavel Chekov (Anton Yelchin) Based on his performance, very believable. Then we have eye-candy Zoe Saldana as Communication's officer Nyota Uhura. Her 'brief tease' and wondrous appearance in this film is not only attractive, vivacious, but forcefully sexy. What is unexpected is her apparent love interest which will conjure up a bagful of mixed images in the sequel. After the introduction of Eric Bana as the heavy, Ben Cross as Sarek, we are further treated to special guest appearance by Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime. The film is loaded with magnificent action scenes, hurtling explosive crafts, photon blasts and violently exploding worlds. In addition, the inter-dimensional space-time travel and encounters with gigantic Black Holes will have the audience gasping and wanting more. Excellent film and a worthy addition to Gene Roddenberry's dream. ****",9,53,106,26 November 2009
Citizen Kane," ' If you don't understand power, I'll spell it out . It means, I can do whatever I want. '
","Throughout the late 19th and creeping into the 20th century, there were great men and powerful individuals. Some were discovered great after their death, others proclaimed it for themselves and a few were humble enough to accept the results of their labors. Here is ' Citzen Kane ' which many loyal fans claim was the finest movie ever made. I watched with avid interest reasoning it was a good film and a grand testimony to the late William Randolph Hearst. Despite his annoyance with it, Hearst tried unsuccessfully to have it destroyed. Within the length of this movie is the story of Charles Foster Kane (Orsen Wells) who with a sizable legacy rose from obscurity to the richest man in America. With the aid of his closest friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and the often irritated Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) he gallivanted from one lively pursuit to another, having fun with his wealth often at the expense of others. Believing he is incapable of failure, he runs for Governor and attempts a high profile marriage. Despite power and position, Caine learns first hand there are some things money can't buy. The movie itself is a Black and White study in human nature and we should remember the adage, 'the bigger one gets in life, the smaller he becomes.' The magnificent cast includes Ray Collins, Dorothy Comingore and Agnes Moorehead, all of which earned the highest praise from the industry and audiences across the country. The result was the creation of a true Classic. ****",8,2,3,6 May 2010
Monster," ' One Life which started at the bottom and worked it's way down '
","Nature is ambivalent when dispensing life. Each beginning is allowed to experience its birth and thereafter what follows is not it's concern. Life among humans is so much the same. Everyone is given life. Some good, some bad and many others are a miserable collection of tragedies. This dramatic film is called ' Monster ' which explains little of the life of Aileen Wuornos, America's first recorded female serial killer. Charlize Theron convincingly plays Aileen, a young woman who endures a tragic beginning which eventually leads to a life of prostitution. According to her story, she becomes a victim of a sadistic customer or 'John' who brutalizes her, prompting her defense which results in murder. Finding a soul-mate in a girl-friend named Selby (Christina Ricci) the two then become a pair of fugitives, leaving a trail of murder victims across state lines. Bruce Dern is interesting as 'Thomas', a former Viet-Nam Vet and friend who adds a wonderful advisory element to an otherwise dark and somber film. Scott Wilson is another surprise addition who plays Horton, her last victim. One should recall it was Wilson who played Richard Hickock in the movie 'In cold blood' with Robert Blake. The black film dwells mostly on Aileen's lifetime complaint that she was never given a chance at the good life. Written and directed by Patty Jenkins, the film and its star receives much acclaim and due credit. A good offering to anyone who wants to skim the surface of a violent life which ended, much like it began. ****",8,1,3,5 November 2009
Inglourious Basterds," ' There are nine million Jews watching you burn in Hell, don't ruin it by asking for mercy '
","During World War Two, the widening German occupation spread a reign of Terror across the face of Europe to such a degree, no one could believed it emulated from the pitch black heart of one insane man. Its eventual destruction would take the lives of millions before they were finally crushed. Many special groups were counted among those who participated. This is one movie called ' Inglourious Basterds ' and is the story of American Jews who were responsible for creating fear and terror in the Third Reich. The story was written and directed by noted director Quentin Tarantino and contains enough magic to create the foundation of a Classic. The selected unit called 'Bastards' are led by Brad Pitt who plays Tennessee born LT. Aldo Raine, a no nonsense officer with only one motto. 'Kill the Nazi and bring me his scalp!' With a special, nay unique group of elite soldiers, like Eli Roth, Michael Fassbender and Daniel Bruhl they aim to terrorize the very regime which believes itself to be 'the superior race.' Although they aim to destroy the Nazi war machine, their immediate target is Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) who fancies himself the best soldier in the German army. Actually he is one dispassionate, indiscriminate and certainly the most vicious Nazi in France. In the film one of his victims named Shosanna, (Mélanie Laurent) recalls the slaughter of her family and vows vengeance. With the exceptional talents of special guest star Rod Taylor (Dark of the Sun; signature theme included) Til Schweiger and Martin Wuttke who plays Hitler, in addition with a screen full of dramatic, sometimes brutal action, this movie proves both entertaining and with the 'Tiger tank theme' becomes morbidly exciting. The movie is not for the faint hearted, but will literally set the screen on fire. Great film. ****",8,2,9,28 January 2010
Iron Man 2," ' If I knew I could trust the military, I would gladly give them the weapon '
","From the incredible, innovative and often futurist mind of comic book artist, Stand Lee, comes this sequel to his hero. The Film is called ' Iron Man II. ' Director Jon Theroux, follows the basic character Iron Man, and challenges him with several new problems at once. First the alter ego of the Iron Man, Mr. Tony Stark, (Robert Downey) learns, the atomic power pack in his chest is not only saving his life, but is killing him at the same time. Secondly, his best friend, Lt. Col James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is covering for his friend but is also trying to secure one of the top secret iron man suits for the military and with the help of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) may well succeed. Lastly, there is the main frame heavy, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke, excellent acting), who vows to destroy Stark for betraying his father. Samuel L. Jackson, John Slattery, Garry Shandling and even Stan Lee all make cameo roles. The film is action packed, exciting, and promotes audiences to expect more in the following sequel. If that isn't enough, there is Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow who provide eye-candy with a attitude and a powerful executive allure for Stark. The movie is a worthy addition to the original and if you over-look a few minor flaws, such as none of the military figures, nor the police or the security guards are female, then the movie is well done and audiences look forward to the next. ****",8,3,4,2 October 2010

","In the country of France, there were many atrocities inflicted against the nation as a whole. Divide the country by the number of children the Germans destroyed during World War II and you'll discover too many to account for. Of course, out of every massacre, one or two survivors arose after the war to point an accusing finger at those responsible. One of those eye witnesses was Louis Malle.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The Celluloid Pirate
","In the eighteen century, in the West Indies of the Caribbean Sea, there roamed a magnificent seafaring group of individuals who prided themselves in not only creating an adventurous and certainly idealistic way of life, but enamored a secondary generation to emulate their deeds centuries after their demise. They became known as The Pirates of the Caribbean. Today, the Disney group is satisfying the demand of the visual interpretation of said pirates. Reflecting and certainly echoing their traditional exploits is Disney's film version of the same name. In this film, Johnny Depp, is fabulous as Captain Jack Sparrow. This individual is a small package filled with more excitement than a barrel of gunpowder. Throughout this film he consistently invites the viewer to follow him from multiple escapes, duels with sword makers, damsels in distress and British Soldiers from the port-cities and market towns, in search of a cursed ship called The Black Pearl. Strewn throughout this adventure are Depps' fellow actors which include, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom who is superb as Will Turner, Jack Davenport as Norrington and Keira Knightley, as Elizabeth Swann whom seems at times incongruous and out of place as the precursor of a modern feminist. Despite the awesome, incredible, often ideal locations and speculator scenery, studded with everything, but the essentials allowing the film lack to resolution for Sparrow or the viewer. Often we anticipate either, to be thrust into yet another hair-raising adventure or a ghost chasing episode which is setting itself up for a further sequel. Thus despite it's wondrous appeal, and Sparrow's ever changing destiny and demeanor, ( which by the way is a bit, effeminate, the film lacks adhesion to either traditional pirates or to their eventuality. In the end, it's a good film, which insists on re-creating itself again and again. ****",8,2,5,28 December 2006

12 Angry Men," The Lonely Juror
","One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like 'Twelve Angry Men' to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****",10,7,10,23 May 2007
Public Enemies," ' When You can't use the very best, you must in desperation, use what you got '
","There are a small group of great directors and Michael Mann is among the very best. When he decided to make a movie of the exploits of the 1930's era gangster, I believed he would be the right one to do it. Assembling what seems to be the finest cast available, I like so many others, thought, you can't go wrong with them. The Movie is called ' Public Enemies ' and is based on the early history of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the F.B.I. and the fading glory of America's most notorious gangsters. At the top of the F.B.I. list however was Public Enemy number One, Mr. John Dillinger (Johnny Depp). Other notables like Baby Face nelson (Stephen Graham) and Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum) were also hunted by the fledgling Federal Bureau. The film centers much on the turmoil between Lack Luster J. Edgar Hoover who had more skeletons than most and Special agent Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) who outshone his boss. It also highlights Dillinger and Billy Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and their costly relationship. Although it the last years of the famous gangster's life, the movie stick pretty close to the facts, including his betrayal at the bio-graph theater. The film does contain sufficient drama and gunfighting actions to keep an audience interested, but there is something missing when one gets a superb cast and is kept waiting. Maybe it's was left in the history books? ****",8,1,2,14 December 2009

","In 1973 the greatest martial artist appeared on the American silver screen in a film called ' Fists of fury.' His name was Bruce Lee. Since then dozens of martial art movies have followed. Some good, others fair, with the majority being mere imitations. Serious films involving the finest of oriental arts are rare, therefore the ones which capture American audiences today are often comedies. Here is one example. The film is called ' Balls of Fury.' If you have seen 'Fists of fury' you'll have no difficult seeing the parody in this movie.

Alexander," Ancient Hero, Christian Movie
","Oliver Stone has created an extraordinary movie with his film Alexander. Taken from the works of dozen of writers, his epic is the finest composite of the mythic hero as could be fashioned. Once completed, the film must now survive the gauntlet of criticisms, opinions and censorship. Although the story is as factual as could be put to cellulose, many historical inaccuracies appear. Still the result is incredible. The selection of Colin Farrell, Connor Paolo and Jessie Kamm, as Alexander prove inspirational. A host of notables, such as Anthony Hopkins, Brian Blessed, Christopher Plummer and Val Kilmer proliferate the historical sage with Angelina Jolie and Francisco Bosch whose handsome features adds legendary beauty to the masterpiece. Opting not to incur the wrath of Christian Hollywood, Stone allows ancient Hellenic boys who wrestled in the nude to wear loin cloths in the Greek gym and plays down the homosexual angle between Alexander and Hephaiston, for the romantic adore and a single kiss with the Persian Boy, Bagoas.

Troy," Heroes and the Ancient World
","Achilles was known as the immortal created by the waters of the river Styx. His heroic story reverberates across the centuries and is illuminated by the film entitled TROY. Director Wolfgang Petersen draws well on his extensive talent and has created an enormous masterpiece for audiences for years to come. Combining the enormous talents of such notables as Peter O'Toole, Eric Bana, Brian Cox, and Orlando Bloom the setting awakens with a true panorama of both spectacle and historical value. The few flaws wound within the beautiful tapestry of the film are only apparent to those who have any knowledge of the works of Homer or studied classic antiquity. The most obvious is the absence of the intimate relationship between Achilles and his lover Patroclus. Also noticeable is the Spartan soldiers allowing women at their feast instead of their traditional partners. Other minor flaws consist of squeezing the ten year siege war into the space of two hours and of course, for the more aesthetic among us, the unattractive 'Trojan Horse.' Nonetheless, the spectacular, panoramic fight scenes are impressive and magnificent. A classic film if ever there was one. ****",9,10,19,19 September 2005

Touching off a firestorm of controversy, this film is the first of what many believe will be the next barrier in the long history of prejudicial cinema. Years ago, Europeans ventured into this forbidden niche and established a precedent which up until now, American film companies have been reluctant to address. With the incredible talents of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist the US has not only responded and shattered conventional wisdom, but offers perhaps the finest film of it's genre. Brokeback mountain is a story of two men searching for companionship and love.

There amid a vast wilderness, tending sheep and reflecting on their dreary lives, Ennis and Jack accept their solitude and quickly learn they are drawn to each other. Neverthelless, their conventional world defies, tugs and tears at their burgeoning affection for one another. Both men feel passionately, yet realize their forbidden affair could easily rip apart their facade of masculinity. Eventually, over a period of twenty years, they learn to deal with friends, families, and social pressures as their secret begins to evaporate. Emotionally charged and deeply touching in every respect, the film presents audiences with a portrait of fading Americana, amid changing seasons. All in all, a courageous attempt to mirror the life and loves of a reclusive aspect of the American cowboy. ****",10,15,27,6 April 2006

This is not a film for the faint heart, but for anyone who's brave enough for a Real movie of the Viet-Nam War. *****",10,4,7,6 July 2010
Crash," City in Collison
","In the Film 'Crash', movie viewers are challenged to remain ambivalent while following the life line of a city afloat in a sea of racial tensions. The story begins with a touching philosophical summery of modern life in the large metropolis of America. Don Cheadle, in what is likely to become a classic role for him, gives a most inspiring performance as a Los Angeles policeman in search of meaning. In his role as an investigative police detective, he searches for the murderer of his brother and a victim of a gunshot shooting. While he makes his rounds of the city, he attempts to hold his family together while all around him, other people are struggling with theirs. Each life is laced with personal stereotypical barriers which prompts others to collide with them. Each suffers through their own brand of racial bigotry and in turn allows the viewer to see themselves in this fascinating mirror of life. Memorable performances from Matt Ryan, Billy Gallo, and Ryan Phillippe as Hanson, highlight this amazing collection of stories. After watching this film, it's little wonder why it was chosen as Picture of the Year. ****",10,5,13,8 March 2006
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," ' Mr. President , . . We Must Not Allow a Mine-Shaft Gap!!! '
","In all the years of film making, Peter Sellers never disappointed an audience. No matter what the part, he always seem to find the perfect voice and therefore, his character. If you put him together with other equally great character actors like, George C. Scott who plays maniacal Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and Sterling Hayden as the insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Jack The Ripper?) and the Slim Pickens as Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong, James Erle Jones as Lt. Lothar Zogg, the bombardier and Peter Bull as the Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, then you not only have an award winning film, but the secret formula for a Classic. The story is set in the sixties, during the Cold War and a lunatic Air Wing Commander intentionally gives the 'Gold Code Signal for his wing to attack Russia. What follows is a dramatic minute ticking film, designed to illuminate the military's ignorance, stupidity and final acquiescence of the doomsday, 'Fail-Safe' device. The entire movie is a comedy of errors and one reflected of Standly Kubrick's genius. The one sequence where Major Kong rides a nuclear missal to its target is synonymous with the mentality of the pentagon. Through the passage of time, this superb movie has not only become a Dark Classic, but a possible statement of the future reality of the human race. ****",9,26,50,1 November 2008
Shutter Island," ' Reality is a matter of circumstance, whomever you trust determines that '
","The Second World War was one great big mess and those who survived a visit to the Concentration Camps were doubly affected. Famed film director Martin Scorsese and novelist Dennis Lehane teamed to bring his book to the big screen. The movie, like the novel is called ' Shutter Island. ' The year is 1954 and two U.S. Marshalls Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent from the mainland to an offshore island for the criminally insane. The reason is simple, a violent and dangerous inmate Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams) has somehow escaped the maximum prison and remains at large. The two Marshalles are introduced to Dr.Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) who seem very reluctant to divulge any pertinent information on any aspect of the place, patients or their protocol. With the warden (Ted Levine) watching their every move, it's difficult to proceed. However, with dogged skill, Daniels finally discovers much more than he's suppose too and finds himself the target of what he believes is a monstrous conspiracy involving Nazis, illegal experimental drugs and murder. The movie begins suspensively driven, shifts quickly into a dark mode and then flings the audience into the realm of the diabolical. All in all, the fast paced drama is another triumph for the team of De Caprio and Scoresese. Easilly recommended. ****",8,5,10,19 June 2010
Capote," The Dark Within the Author
","Selecting the final segment in the life of author Truman Capote, the film 'Capote', delves into the inner and certainly troubled soul of the American Novelist. The film itself, is a somber reflection of the price Capote paid to write what appears to be his most poignant work. The introduction of the book and the movie itself invites the audience into the real life drama of the Kansas family who were brutally murdered by two killers named Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) and Perry Smith (Clifton Collins) in 1963. Along the way, one observes how adroitly, the writer is able to weave his tapestry between truth and fiction to achieve his ultimate goal. With the help of an assortment of great actors, such as Bruce Greenwood (Jack Dunphy) and Chris Cooper, Alvin Dewey) the film exhibits the enormous talent, and human flaws which made Capote a household word. Like an excellent novel, the movie is slow to build, but eventually achieves a touching tribute to the man.",7,2,3,23 April 2006

Still, the adventure taken by Pi to strange places unknown, prompts questions which lie between reality and mystical illusion. In addition the fantastic movie invites the audience to experience the incredible and harrowing ordeal with him. The result is a film not easily forgotten especially with the help of international stars like Gerard Depardieu. Easily recommended to all. ****",8,1,3,18 September 2013

","Anyone who has ever seen Ocean's Twelve know right off, if there is a sequel, it's going to be fun and intricate, if not as down right complex. Thus it is with this third installment. Danny Ocean's friend Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) who believed he was 'in the know' with his partner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) and expecting to make a fortune, learns' he is not only fired, but is thrown out of the Casino business.

The drawbacks are enormous as added to the mix is an arch-enemy of Banks', a powerful insider named Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). He is a vengeful sore loser who dislikes Banks and promises trouble for Ocean and his men if they are unsuccessful. They movie is top heavy with star power including Eddy Lizzard, the British Comedian. Every audience member must stay focused on the characters, the multi-staged plan and expected double crosses as this is a fast paced film crowded with counter plans and Casino like excitement where anyone can win at any moment.

Pacific Rim," ' This isn't a safety tunnel, it's a buffet '
","Guillermo Del Toro directed this futuristic story by Travis Beacham and created a futurist setting where Mankind is faced with total annihilation. Attacking from within a Time-energy portal, a series of Gigantic and colossal monsters set about to destroy the world's populations and absorb it's natural resources. To stop them, the world's humans do what they have never ever done before, they unite. Crafting colossal Robots the humans enclose two mentally linked pilots (Charlie Hunnam and Diego Klattenhoff) to combat their adversaries in the deep oceanic trenches of the Pacific Ocean. Idris Elba plays the General in charge of Operations and Ron Perlman plays the scavenger parts dealer. The movie is one gigantic world wide conflict with titanic battles and super powerful beings and there is no shortage of super struggles. The Humans are hard pressed to fight the incredible monsters, while the creatures are Ratcheting up their plan of world conquest. If one were to select a slight criticism of the movie I would ask why 90% of the movie is filmed in the dark. It is difficult to study all the fantastic art work which went into the filming and the story itself is hobbled by inconclusive ends which remain unresolved. Still what there is of it has the audience mesmerized with gigantic battles which absorbed every bit of interest in the theater. This movie is one for the Classics and one would not be surprised if it generates a sequel. Easily recommended. ****",9,9,13,25 November 2013

The Aviator," ' Genius? What are the limits of Insanity ? '
","John Logan wrote the script for this film study of the late Howard Hughes. Under the skillful direction of Martin Scorsese, this movie is thereafter called ' The Aviator. ' It is the bio-Pic of one of the wealthiest, controversial, influential and certainly most flamboyant magnate of the 30's, 40's and 50s'. The son of an oil industrialist who left him an oil and drill bit company which he further expanded into a huge fortune, he further managed to increase its' holdings many times. Later, Howard Hughes became synonymous with early movies which challenged the Hays Code and brought America such stars as Jane Russel. During the same span of years, Hughes became afflicted with a debilitating ailment called O.C.D. or Osbessive Compulsive Disorder. However, his superior efforts also brought him world recognition as well as disastrous influence over many who saw him as a man out of control and a disturbing paranoid mania for cleanliness and perfection. In this film, the cast which features, Leonardo DiCaprio, is superior as he plays the eccentric Howard Hughes, with Cate Blanchett doing a superb job as Katharine Hepburn. Other cast members include Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Ian Holm and Jude Law. The movie is a fast paced ride from Boyhood to reclusive tycoon and each triumph is matched only by the equally strange behaviors which find him isolated in small hotel room afflicted by Allodynia. Still, the director has placed this film in the Annals of the Classics and I have to agree. ****",8,2,4,15 March 2014
Oblivion," ' The most difficult opponent you'll ever encounter, is yourself '

"Good Morning, Vietnam"," ' You're in more dire need of a BJ, than any white man in History '
","The harrowing tour of Viet-Nam is a chapter in a man's life which is something he will not soon forget. Having survived it, one wonders why the U.S. military tried so hard to deny they were ever involved. Having been stationed there, we did as this movie so aptly portrays, listened to the Armed Forces radio while in the field. The film is called ' Good Morning Viet-Nam ' and is purported to be the story of Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) the Disc-jockey who was transferred from the isle of Create to serve in Viet-Nam. Once there, the exuberant and happy-go-lucky DJ, becomes the troops' favorite, boosting moral and actively seeking feminine company. It is this later activity which brings Cronauer into direct conflict with Sgt. Major Dickerson (the late, J. T. Walsh) a no-nonsense, strait lace serviceman with no sense of humor. Although the disc-jockey disrupts the military radio station playing rock and roll music and ad-libbing comical sketches of various political figures, which upsets Lt. Steven Haul (Bruno Kirby) it is his after-hours activities with Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana) his girlfriend and Tuan (Tung Thanh Tran) her brother which produces sobering consequences and tragic results. Were it not for Gen. Taylor (Noble Willingham) his military patron, his stay would have been disastrous. Forest Whitaker and Robert Wuhl round out the fine cast and liven the radio setting. For Robin Williams, this movie is at the top of his impressive repertoire and is sure to become a Classic for his fans. Highly recommended as a collector's item. ****",8,2,3,1 October 2009
Watchmen," ' In the Dark world of Comics, there is a shattered window called Reality '
","Growing up as a child, one of the first avenues to the world of reading came when I discovered my first comic book. Little did I know, within this fantastic world, there was a dividend which awaken my vivid imagination and allowed me to see the liquid, magical world of fantasy. Yet among those early comics, there were also a plethora of other fans who wished someone could make the comics come alive in a very real, adult sense. Such a wondrous world emerged when movies like 'Superman' with Christopher Reeves and 'Batman' with Michael Keaton were created. Although spectacular and entertaining, there was an ingredient missing. That torn sliver of fantasy arrived with this movie called ' Watchmen.' When you view this remarkable film, be prepared for a really exciting, gritty, physically gutsy, morbidly macabre 1950's atmosphere to envelop you as the director has reached the edge of the envelope and ripped it asunder. The story is set in the Alternative world of the 1980's. In this world, Nixion is re-elected for a third term and an aging group of magical super-heroes have been rendered obsolete. Mothballed into retirement, the world lumbers slowly into the unthinkable abyss of nuclear self-destruction and is terrifyingly real as reminded by the Doomday clock. The world needs help, but the Superheros are all powerless to help, until one night when one by one, for some unexplainable reason, they become the target of a mysterious and unknown character. One member Walter Kovacs (Jackie Haley) of the once incredible super heroes group called Rorschach, begins a dangerous investigation with the death of The Comedian (Jeffry Morgan). He is aided by Nite Owl (Pat Wilson), Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) and the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) yet, despite their combined powers, they face certain death as both the world and their group face the end of the world. The film is bursting with dark explosive black drama and nearly all the ingredients are present to create a monumental Classic. This is recommended as just that, a dark movie for anyone who was raised on Classic comics. Superb viewing. ****",10,5,10,23 August 2009
The Bourne Identity," ' The most dangerous part about chasing a Tiger, is that occasionally you catch one '
","Those of you who have ever read any of the great novels written by Robert Ludlum, know he is a superb writer. Having read the book which is the basis for 'The Bourne Identity ' I found that director Doug Liman did not adhere very closely to the book. Instead he allowed the main character to float to the top of his demise, like a dangerous water Mine and allowed the ticking to get louder as the movie progresses. Our hero is found floating in the waters off the coast of Marseilles, dead to the world. Yet, within weeks, Jason Bourne is out to learn, what is that ringing in his head? What was he doing before he was shot, but most important of all who is he? The film begins with a watery mystery, followed by a trail of bread crumbs which then explodes with a high powered surge of pure Adrenalin. Action scenes follows Bourne wherever he goes and so too, his adversaries who are just as lethal as he is. Excitement awaits movie audiences as our hero encounters both the heavies as well as his fellow Treadstone agents. False identities are as plentiful as the bullets which try to kill him, but for any Ludlum fan, what awaits us at the end of the film, is usually not what we expect, for that we need to read the book. Exceptional acting by the fine cast and a great way to spend an evening with Matt Damon. ****",9,2,2,15 March 2011
Man of Steel," ' That is actually a Krypton letter, which means Hope '
","The story upon which this movie is based was written by David S. Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder. After viewing it, I can honestly say that this film was action, action and nothing but action. For this movie a New actor was selected in the form of Henry Cavill who sports the duel Identity of Clark Kent / Kal-El. Judging from the audience reaction in the theater they chose remarkably well. The original story as originally penned by Joe Shuster and Jerry Segiel has accepts a completely new Facelife in many creative areas. Indeed, from the ' Man of Steel's ' home planet where gigantic flying alien creatures roam to their advance interstellar spaceships, the movie scenes are fantastic. In addition, Supermans' parents and step-parents have also evolved to include Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Diane Lane. The new Superman is superb in every way what with flying scenes, fighting confrontations interstellar space travel, the movie is dynamically packed, brimming with creative excitement and has an abundance of Aeriel conflicts. Other Hollywood notables like Richard Schiff, Laurence Fishburne and Christopher Meloni combine to make for a great movie. If I were to select tiny criticisms of the film I would ask why Jor-el (Russel Crowe) never got a shave for the part and why Superman's cape wasn't a bit shorter. Of course, that is just my opinion, I could be wrong. ****",8,4,8,12 December 2013
The Thing," ' It isn't fear that's out there, it's suspicion which breeds in here among us '
","John Carpenter took this timeless classic from the 1950's and updated it with his version of ' The Thing. ' The movie is based on the original John Campbell Jr. story and set not in the North Pole as in the original, but at the South Pole. In this version we have versatile actor Kurt Russell playing R.J.MacReady and Wilford Brimley as Dr. Blair. In this version, our Space visitor is seemly more dangerous as the 51 version in that The creature has the complete ability to Morph into any other creature. In other words, it's capable of 'Shape-Shifting' and becoming any creature it comes in contact with. Much more menacing than before, it soon has the entire cast wondering which of them will be next to be absorbed. Dark and horrifying, the movie is both dramatic and suspenseful and with the shadowy world of the space alien, it's only a matter of time before all the cast become prey. A good story and definitely more frightening than the original. Easily recommended. ****",Null,1,2,11 December 2010
Armageddon," ' It Happen before, it will happen again. It's just a question of when '
","The praise for this film has not dwindled much since it's inception. The movie is perhaps one of the finest films of the past twenty years. The title is ' Armageddon ' which is synonymous with the end of the world. It's appropriate as this film purports to show what would happen if a gigantic size asteroid were to strike the earth. The story concerns the fate of the planet and what the earth's brightest men would do to save it. Concluding the best way to stop the rock in outer space, a brilliant research scientist Dr. Ronald Quincy (Jason Isaacs) devises a plan. The best drillers in the world are recruited to fly into outer space, land on the traveling asteroid, drill 800 feet into it's surface, plant a nuclear bomb and split it in half. The man requested is Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and he is told by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) the director of NASA that he has been selected to save the planet. Reluctantly, Stamper agrees but insists on taking his own crew which includes Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi as Rockhound, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan as 'Bear.' The special effects in the movie are incredible as is the top notch acting by Peter Stormare as Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut and Keith David as General Kimsey. Overall, the film story is terrific and the major components are deeply emotional, exciting and superb. The result is a major achievement for the movie industry and a well deserved honor as a Classic. ****",10,2,5,28 February 2009
Knowing," ' If one knows the future, does he become a Prophet or a curse? '
","Among the enlightened of our population there is a word which has multiple of meanings. The word is Cabal. The ability to see words and phrases within a immense series of random numbers. To some the ability is nothing more than coincidence. To others, a stark reminder that some beings can see into the future and predict events or disasters. Yet, even with this talent, the curse or gift can become a nuisance as it's also called The Cassandra Complex. It states, even if you can tell people the future, few will believe you. That is what happens to Nicolas Cage who plays John Koestler, a theoretical physicist who discovers an unusual paper written by a young elementary student named Lucinda, (Lara Robinson) unearth in a 1950's time capsule. At first he dismisses it, but then discovers it's terrible secret. With his troubled son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) they try to fathom the paper's ultimate prediction. With the power of a gifted Thespian, Cage give a riveting performance and throughout the film, the audience is drawn into his fanatic and desperate race to safeguard his son and the rest of humanity. The special effects in this film are amazing and awe inspiring, indeed, astonishing and eerily real. It's conclusion is well worth the price of admission.

","There are many good directors who if given a chance can create a once in a lifetime masterpiece. Some are truly great artists. Case in point, David Lean. His 'Dr. Zhivago' film is one fantastic movie given celluloid life in visual form. Add a memorable score, which includes the haunting 'Laura's Theme' by Maurice Jarre' and you have a Classic treasure indeed. Having read Boris Pasternak's novel, I found little difference in the transition. It is the story of a young boy Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) who's life intertwines with men, women and world changing events. Beginning in the mountain country, he grows up in Moscow amid, culture, social injustice, political revolution, World War and his own personal involvement with two special women.

American Beauty," 'You have suddenly become my Hero'
","There is a motto which too often is over used by many which goes 'It's What Every Man Dream's of.' The film American beauty is one such basis for that foundation. In this story Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham who is a burned out magazine salesman and after fourteen years, suffers a a mid-life crises.

However, situations in his life cause Lester to become unaware of the murderous dangers arising from his neighbors, adulterous wife and patristic daughter, so much so, that what he sees as freedom, others consider destructive family threats.

The Alamo," ' You asked for a vote, now that you lost, you want to change the rules '
","According to a historical source, 'The first casualty of war is always the truth.' Concerning this story, it's amusing to learn despite best efforts, the pertinent facts continue to be forgotten, disregarded or simply ignored. The 2004 film is called ' The Alamo ' the events concerning the battle at the old mission gets a face lift and some of the actual facts are finally included in the story. In this updated version, the hero of the Alamo, David Crockett is very ably played by Billy Bob Thornton. Taking a more modest approach to the actual figure from Tennessee, he allows the myth to dissipate and replaced with a more humble, introverted and practical character. Jason Patric plays James Bowie with a sincere sympathetic and vulnerable veiner which allows the audience to recognize the famous knife-fighter as a man conscious of his own mortality. Patrick Wilson is William Barret Travis, the prideful boisterous and often antagonistic lawyer given command of the tiny mission. With a handful of regular soldiers, he accepts the doomed post with the full knowledge his was only a holding action and without help not expected to hold. Dennis Quaid plays Sam Houston and seen as a self-determined leader of a republic torn from a poorly governed country. The fact of Crockett's death is as close to the literal record written by Jose Pena. The movie is structured well and when the actual facts are imposed, the fiery six hour assault, destruction of the crumbling adobe building and the killing of the all volunteer force of 186 men becomes a fitting tribute to the men and their cause. The reason why this movie will become a Classic will be due to the cast, it's director and the fact someone tried to tell the truth and that stands of it's own accord. ****",9,11,11,23 July 2009
Judgment at Nuremberg," ' Just for laughs general, what was the war all about? '
","There are many people in the world today who suffered the tattooed numbers, visible scars, tortured memory and indelible atrocities of the Concentration Camps. It's strange for a history teacher to hear that many want to forget the past, the pain and agonizing suffering inflicted on the innocent. For those who were actually there, or had friends, family or loved ones murdered by the Nazis, there can be no erasing the past. Occasionally a courageous film arises which endeavors to bring to light the black memories which so many wish would go away. In this black and white film called ' Judgement at Nuremberg ' the audience is offered a dramatic depiction of the War Crimes trial of the German Judges who themselves sent so many to die to appease their Nazi leaders. The star power of this movie is what makes it a monumental triumph and a fitting tribune to the victims of the Germanic court. In this story, based on the courtroom dockets of the Nuremberg trials, we have Spencer Tracy playing Chief Judge Dan Haywood, an American judge who makes an obvious observation and says, 'I've been here for some time now and as far as I can tell, No one, knew what was going on.' Burt Lancaster is Dr. Ernst Janning, the most senior judge on trial, who tried to explain the fervor of the times, the 'passing phase', saying, 'I never meant for things to go that far.' Richard Widmark plays Col. Tad Lawson, who's despite his serious and sober evidence, is asked to show leniency. Maximilian Schell is brilliant as Hans Rolfe, the defense attorney. Werner Klemperer is Emil Hahn and William Shatner as Capt. Harrison Byers. True there are other stars of great distinction, but you must see the movie, to see how each contributed to make this incredible movie into a film Classic. ****",9,3,3,10 December 2008
Apocalypse Now," ' You Need to assassinate this man as he is winning a war, we promised we wouldn't win '
","Americans have always won wars which involved great patriotism. World War I and II were global and fought in conjunction with our allies and were eventually brought to successful conclusions. After that, American wars were not successful as the goals and their ultimate purposes were hazy at best. The Viet-Nam war was a case in point. As the film 'Apocalypse Now' tells it, a 'special opts' soldier, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is selected to travel up-country in Viet-Nam to assassinate or as they put it, 'terminate' the command of Colonel Walter Kurtz (Marlon Brando) as he is doing something which the pentagon officials have promised the politicians they would not do. This determined American individual is winning the war and doing it with such field tactics and savage methods which in their mind boarder on the criminal. Williard is torn between admiration for his target and conviction for his mission. Along the way, the Captain sees just how insane the Viet-Nam war really is. One commander he meets Lt. Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall) borders on sheer lunacy with statements such as ' I love the smell of Napalm in the morning.' Another individual he meets is a photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) so impressed with Kurtz' ability to win the war, believes him to be not only mystical, but divine. The story is loosely based on Joseph Conrad's book 'Heart of Darkness' where the hero is sent not to kill him, but to save him. However in this adaptation Willard the assassin, who mimicking robot-like soldiers will follow orders regardless how insane those orders are. The great cast includes Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms, Laurence Fishburne, Harrison Ford and Scott Glenn as Lieutenant Colby make this film one of the truly memorable pictures of our time. Winning so many awards, its difficult to tell which aspect of the movie helped make this story a Classic. ****",8,3,4,27 January 2009
Van Helsing," ' To you it's a mirror, for the Prince of Darkness, it's a doorway to Hell '
","If you're a fan of Gothic stories, this movie is just what the doctor ordered. Nearly every conceivable horror creature created for the silver screen is resurrected for this masterpiece. Mary Shelley's Frankenstine born in 1818, Bram Stoker's Dracula penned in 1897, the fable Lycanthrope, Wolfman and even Robert Louis Stevenson's duel identities of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are part of this magnificent and horrifying menagerie. The story also includes Dracula's Black Transylvanian castle, the pathetic hunchback assistant Igor and an army of throat-ripping, flying children of the night. But just to round-out the story the famed vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing takes center stage to this nightmarish saga. The film is called ' Van Helsing ' and is a living tribute to all the horror stories of the 1930's 40 and 50's. What this movie offers is a collection of those dark tales and nightmares we thought we'd forgotten in our youth. Not so, with the incredible special effects this film uses, those black dreams return and are more terrifying than ever. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, with Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. Kevin J. O'Connor is Igor and surprisingly Alun Armstrong plays Cardinal Jinette. Samuel West is Dr. Victor Frankenstein with Robbie Coltrane and Stephen Fisher both playing Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. For those seeking eye candy there is Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran as Marishka. From start to finish, there is so much action, drama and savage physical confrontation it's nearly impossible to turn away. What puzzles me is the main characters' constantly fall from dizzying heights to crash against everything from thick wooden beams to concrete and stone barriers of all kinds and yet few bones are ever broken. Still, the excitement and enjoyment from this movie are incredible, so much so, it's no wonder it immediately became a Classic. Superb! ****",10,17,30,25 July 2009
Ender's Game," ' Oftentimes, we dream our future, only to seek it out and destroy it '
","Director Gavin Hood must have had fun directing this movie as it seem he created a gigantic Video game. Taken from the novel by Orson Scott Card, it purports to tell the story of Ender Wiggin, (Asa Butterfield) a young man who dreams of joining the military and becoming a great Space hero like his former brother. However he suffers from strange dreams and bad nightmares which aggravates his inferiority complex, not to mention school bullies who seek him out for sport and ridicule. Still he show so much promise a high ranking Officer (Harrison Ford) believe he has the makings of an officer and a great fleet Commander in outer space. In addition, a powerful and fearsome alien race has already attacked Earth some 70 years ago and is said to be waiting to return to destroy humanity. To this end, Earth has taken to recruit Earth's finest young cadets and is training them to become the last line of defense. Ben Kingsley, stars as Mazer Rackham, a high ranking Officer who sets out to hone Wiggins' natural talents and prepare him to do battle with the Alien enemy. Despite his gifts, Wiggins, doubts himself and his the abilities to become the Future Leader his superiors believe he will become. Finally there are the terrible dreams which nightly haunt him as if warning him of his future. The film is jam packed with action, excitement and phenomenal scenes which nearly memorizes the audience. All in all, it's becomes a great movie and one which not only entertains us, but is thought provoking in it's message. The book delves into far more detail, but the film does it's best and is slated to become a Classic. Highly recommended as a Great Sci-Fi for the future. ****",8,4,8,1 March 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," ' When walking through the land of fear, Run! don't wait for it to catch up. '
","From the terrifying , but fertile mind of Stieg Larsson, arrives this unusual, dark Gothic story from which the strange black novel was created. Having read the book, then seeing the visual adaption, one can see why director David Fincher did not adhere too closely to the murder/mystery story. This is one of those interesting films which attracts you because of the main star, Daniel Craig who plays disgraced novelist Mikael Blomkvist, then entertains you with scenes which are not for the faint of heart. The story begins as a film of a writer who writes an expose on a wealthy individual and fails, only to have himself dragged through the courts and ruined. He is soon recruited by a wealthy industrialist who hires him to write a biography of his strange family, and in doing so, to investigate a 40 year old mystery. When he needs help Mikael employs a superb cyber hacker who furnishes him with information which takes him far beyond where he began. Although a mystery movie, the film becomes a journey through a nightmarish world of intrigue and murder. Rooney Mara is superb as computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. Christopher Plummer and Stellan Skarsgård and Martin Vanger add mystery and intrigue to an otherwise great movie. Indeed, in time this could very well become as Classic!. Well done. ****",9,7,13,5 April 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," ' Tune in, Turn on, Drop out and may the Force be with you '
","The U.S. Military seems to be composed of two different types of men. The first are incredibly courageous to whom our nation owes its gratitude. The second are those who believe our enemies are always experimenting with foolish and outlandish ideas. Thus our country needs to create an equally ridiculous force to counter it. In this film, we have Bob Wilton, a newspaper reporter (Ewan McGregor) who's lost at the game of love and now seeks his destiny in the middle East conflict of Iraq. Along the way he meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) a mysterious new age American soldier who convinces Wilton, he is part of a secretive unit composed of mental Psychics who plan on changing the armies of the world with their mental powers. Jeff Bridges plays Bill Django, the leader of the group. Kevin Spacey is Larry Hooper, who seeks to gain control of the project for his own agenda. Stephen Lang is convincing as Brigadier General Dean Hopgood. Robert Patrick plays Todd Nixon who is believable as a traveling salesman out to tap into the lucrative Iraqi market. The use of mind bending drugs and alternative mental training is one of the many paths attempted by the military. The unusual premise does make good theater but its' questionable as the audience is unsure whether this is serious comedy or only silly drama. With such star power as herein contained, it should produce an Academy award. However, try as it may, the movie becomes rather tedious and lacks adherence to one or the other. In the end, the great ensemble is wasted on a project which should have hired the members from Staturday night live. A sincere but interesting film. ***",6,1,3,28 March 2010
Spider-Man," The Legend of the Web-Swinger
","Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to 'Spiderman' the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****",9,1,2,28 April 2006
Jarhead," ' This War gives little reason of why good Men should have to die for Oil '
","From personal memoirs and written with first hand knowledge of his military experiences comes a movie called ' Jarhead. ' Director Sam Mendes allows audiences to follow actor Jake Gyllenhaal as Anthony Swofford from Boot camp to The Gulf War otherwise called 'Operation Iraqi Freedom.' Swoffords' book describe the many experiences of the new Marine during his early days in Basic Training, through his desert travels in the Country of Iraq. He learns, as many young men have learned that going to war, does not necessarily means understanding why he must fight. A fact no one ever explains either. Although he and the military enters Iraq, indeed, Kuwait, to secure Freedom for the citizens of Kuwait, none are ever given democracy. In fact the country is returned back to the Despot King after the war ends. As for the movie, it becomes a fixture in Swofford's mind of all the misery the Corps bequeathes to him and his brother Marines. There is no glory in this war and even less in the country he is stationed in. He does however witness the political turmoil and double talk, of the various leaders of his own country from his immediate officers to the inept President George W. Bush who had to further invade the neighboring country of Iraq to try and finish Operation Desert Shield with Operation Desert Storm. The movie is slow to follow as is the gritty outcome of the war. Scenes from utter boredom, the childish behavior of his fellow soldiers to the emotional reactions of comrade's when receiving bad news from back home. Still the cast which includes Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx and Chris Cooper, make for good acting and an interesting story line. The memorable scenes in the movie include the burning of the Oil Wells which in itself are well worth the viewing and the long destructive mess left behind by the Air Force. ****",6,2,4,6 March 2014
Ratatouille," 'Just because anyone can cook. does not mean they should'
","Just when you thought it was too hot to enjoy the company of a Parisian crew in a French kitchen, comes this delightful story of Remy (Patton Oswalt) a country rat with a knack for bourgeois cooking. The animation is top notch and visually incredible. I found very little in the way of any portions which might detract the story from it's intended audience, namely those who enjoy a good story. The great talent of Peter O'Toole is the voice of Anton Ego. a empirical food critic and the icing on this movie cake. Others like (Ian Holm) who is Skinner's voice, add impetus to the star, Lou Romano who plays Linguini. He's excellent by the way as are Brian Dennehy as Django and Peter Sohn who is Emile's voice. Two surprises to this film are James Remar (Ajax, from the Warriors) plays Larousse and Janeane Garofalo who is the voice of Colett, the heart-throb of our hero. The fast paced action and sympathetic storyline is enhanced by the musical score. In all the many talents who contributed to this magnificent tale are to be praised as the story becomes as favorably superb as the recipes themselves. A story for the top pantry shelf and a true classic for the visual library of any connoisseur of fine films. ****",10,1,2,21 July 2008
The Amazing Spider-Man," ' Your abilities are not only a power, they are a responsibility '
","This movie ' The Amazing Spiderman, ' has been way over-due. Ever since it's initial creation by Stan Lee (who makes his usual Cameo appearance), audiences have been hungrily awaiting this new addition. This time, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) confronts a new and incredibly powerful super villain called, 'The Lizard'. Self created by a one armed scientist, named ( Rhys Ifans ) or Dr. Curt Connors, Spiderman unknowingly gives the fantastic formula to a desperate man who has been trying to invent a way for a human to re-generate a missing limb, without realizing the unfortunate side effects. From the beginning, the film has a dark, foreboding and sinister aspect, which pervades through the entire story. Indeed, this sequel returns to it's early history in that the audience is introduced to Parker's lost parents, as well as his present guardians superbly played by Martin Sheen (Who adds a bit of Panache to the movie and Sally Field. Furthermore, Parker is given a new girlfriend called Gwen Stacy and her father seriously played by Denis Leary. The movie itself is incredible, what with all new high flying action sequences, aerial effects and numerous exciting scenes. Although a bit heavy in using mostly nighttime exteriors, it does lend credence to Parker's equally somber state of mind. Over all, the film is grimly superior to earlier chapters and is therefore easily crafted to enthrall us. As a result, the cast and crew, have intentionally created a Classic in the process. Easily recommended to all. ****",8,28,42,19 November 2012
The Exorcist," ' Don't be deceived, there is only one demon within her. '
","There are not too many movies which have the power to achieve the unique status of Classic after it's initial showing in theaters. This is one of them. This film, ' The Exorcist ' written by Peter Blatty, enter the hearts, minds and souls in 1973 with so many opinions, reviews and predictions that nearly every media outlet was flooded with them. Upon entering the modern theater in that time and place, gave everyone a unexplained sense of foreboding. Potential audiences were warned not to see the film alone. The story is based on the mounting and unexplained hysteria of the time called manifested phenomenon. In simpler terms it was called 'possession.' The idea that a beast, demon or satanic monster could posses the body of an innocent victim sent shivers through the spines of believers. In this story we have the Vatican calling on an expert in demonology, one, Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). He is assisted by local priest, Father Karras (Jason Miller) who originally investigates the strange happenings. The investigation attracts the eye of the local police who send Lt. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) to acquire more details. But it is the young actress Linda Blair playing Regan who brings such bestial reality to her character, that in one scene I was terrified at what she could do with her head. I was forever affected and believed. The film garners many accolades and praises that it is unlikely that the film is anything but a true demonic classic. *****",9,4,6,19 September 2008
Pearl Harbor," ' All we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and filled him with anger '
","There are many ways to recall a historical event. You can call for a celebration, throw a parade or recreate it in a movie. The bombing of Pearl Harbor which took place on December 7th, 1941 is one American will never forget and is yearly commemorated. This tragic event has been immortalized on film and attests to it's importance. This film ' Pearl Harbor ' is the latest remake and for this reviewer one of the finest. The event itself has so many historical statistics one weeps. Further, the sorrow is very vivid in the minds of many survivors living today. Taking only a few hours, the attack did not last very long due to the caution expressed by the attacking Japanese. Indeed, the attack is used as a backdrop to the Romantic love story embedded within the memorable day. Destined to become pilots, two farm boys Capt.Rafe and Capt. Dan Walker (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) emerge as adults fliers and exhibit the courage, fortitude and courage prominent in the American Army/Air Corps. of the 1940's. Kate Beckinsale plays Nurse Lt. Evelyn Johnson the love interest of both men. Adding to the collection of major stars which enhance this movie are some real heavyweights, like Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tom Sizemore and Dan Aykroyd. Although, the film is seen as a 'bit' long, (3 Hrs) the action sequences more than make up for it. All in all, the movie packs an explosive punch with it's Aeriel action, fantastic combat footage and its touching human drama. In time, it should have very little trouble becoming a great Classic. Well done! ****",10,2,6,1 August 2009
The Usual Suspects," ' The Greatest Trick The Devil Ever Pulled'
","Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called ' The Usual Suspects' and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****",9,81,103,12 July 2007

","Residents of the Earth know well they live is a scientific age. Their's is a modern world where every modern convenience is at one's finger tip. Yet, few know, or would want to know the cost which many paid to have such a world kept secret. Now, Writer and Director Paul Anderson, has unleashed a film called ' Resident Evil ' which exists hundreds of feet below ground. There, a top secret science laboratory and a fantastic computer called ' The Red Queen ' hums perfectly, until one day it corrupts itself and releases a monstrous air-borne virus through out the maze-like multi-level complex called 'The Hive' causing immediate changes among the employees.

Other civilians like Spence Parks (James Purefoy), Matt Addison (Eric Mabius) along with Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez) and Martin Crewes (Chad Kaplan) are all at the mercy of the Red Queen as the diabolical machine tries to kill them. Everywhere around them, mutant humans and ravenous dogs await their attempt to escape. From beginning to end, the movie demonstrates how fear can be generated from the terror-fill environment. Excitement is everywhere and one never knows just who is there to help or to hinder their progress. What can be concluded is that once you're in the Hive, chances are you will not leave . . . alive!

Quantum of Solace," ' America will sleep with any nation, if it gets it's share of the world'
","If a James Bond action film is what you are looking for, Wow! Are you in for a roller-coaster ride of a movie. This film ' Quantum of Solace ' is nearly impossible to let go even for a second. From the on-set of the film, the action will rocket you from the hi-lands of the Incas, out into the hot barren deserts of Peru. Everywhere our intrepid British spy seems to be on a hunt for those responsible for his former girlfriend's murder. Easily snared by this highly charged movie, the audience is sent careening around narrow mountain passes, through heavy congested traffic, in and around small tunnels and out into the harbor near the sea. Everywhere Bond travels the movie promises to leave you gasping from excitement. The incredible fight scenes between Bond and his enemies which includes a ' 00 ' man and main adversary Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric) can only be described as a sheer adrenalin rush. While James Bond (Daniel Craig)seeks his girlfriend's murderer, MI-5 seeks the would-be assassins of 'M' (Judi Dench) and the tie-in with America's CIA. The cast which was so well crafted in Casino Royal is reassembled to include, Jeffrey Wright as Felix Leiter and Giancarlo Giannini (René Mathis). Another special notice one should look for is the updated use of the super computers used in the dispelling of information. It's very effective and impressive to say the least. Pay close attention to the plot line as there is so much action, it's easy to forget there is one. Great film! ****",9,4,11,30 May 2009

No Country for Old Men," ' What are you looking for? Something in the Dark. No one ever sees that '
","The Western is always in flux and with it the times. In this film ' No Country for Old Men ' the genre pushes the envelope of sanity. There is so much violence in Texas, that modern lawmen are at a loss to explain it all. Clint Eastwood states in one film, 'We keep plugging the dike but the hole keeps getting bigger.' That is most certainly true for this movie. An unemployed welder Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin) is out hunting antelope, stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong. Everyone involved in the massacre is dead leaving a couple of million dollars at the scene. Llewelyn takes the cash and heads for home, unaware the Mexican Mafia and American businessmen want it back. Moss soon learns Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) a Phychopathetic hit man is after him and on his trail is Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) a troubleshooter trying to recover the money. Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy arrive at the drug massacre and try and piece the murders together and discover so many people are killed the whole crime makes little sense. The movie itself is strange as there doesn't seems to be the standard Hero vs bad guy as all involved are creating the mayhem. It's fascinating as the dramatic action is everywhere like the confrontations which remind one of a train crash about to happen. A good film for anyone expecting something different from Hollywood. ****",8,2,3,3 August 2009
District 9," ' Can anger, frustration, apathy, racism, prejudice, compassion and friendship be Universal? '
","Peter Jackson's claim to fame has already been established with his world renown Classic, 'Lord of the Rings.' His experience and expertise was the impetus behind writer/Director Neill Blokamp's superb film entitled ' District Nine.' If history is any guide to Human behavior it's prominently displaced in this incredible film. The story tells of the events which follow when a rag-tag group of Aliens called Prawns arrive on the Earth seeking refuge. In typical Earth style, they are accepted and settled in a desolated area of Johansburg, South Africa called District Nine. Greeted with interest at first, over time the Earth people's original curiosity is replaced with anger, apathy and resentful disdain. That prejudice results in their host erecting restrictive barrier's, bared wire fences and eventually to imprisonment. The general population is apathetic to their plight, with only the Military taking a definite but collective interest in their alien weaponry. Deciding to move the Alien encampment to a distant location, a relocation commissioner Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) takes a personal, but artificially sympathetic approach to their resettlement, that is until he is contaminated with a strange black fluid and begins to evolve into an Alien. His mutation causes him to realize he has become an outcast like his targets. With the government, the press, the military and a select group of lethal mercenaries out to capture or kill him, things become more serious. Further he discovers an ally in a pair of highly intelligent and compassionate Aliens. The movie is jam packed with fast paced action, explosive confrontations and human complexities and as a result this movie will become a triumph for Neill Blokamp and Christopher Johnson who plays all the Extraterristals. Great entertainment. ****",9,3,6,29 January 2010
Batman Begins," The legend of the Dark Knight
","When the brilliant writer Bob Kane first created the Dark Knight of Gothom City in the 1930s, I'm sure one of his after thoughts was to picture his Dark Avenger in a live action movie. The dream has become fact in 'Batman, the beginning.' After viewing it, my first impression is, WOW! The film is a great combination of humanistic philosophy, explosive action, menacing criminals, and an excellent script with talented actors. Crafted in the mind of originator Bob Kane, his Capped Crusader rises from the panels of DC Comics and explodes onto the big screen with all the force of a true classic. As Par for the course, director Christopher Nolan has conscripted the superb performing talents of Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, and Michael Caine as Alfred. All in all, I encourage all viewers to prepare themselves for a action crammed film of legendary characters,explosive scenes and cinematic history. ****",8,1,2,21 October 2005
Twilight," ' Dying is part of nature, but then I'm a freak of nature '
","Throughout film history, the story of the Vampire has established a number of historical origins, film adaptations and colorful characters. From the earliest silent Nosferatu in 1922 to this newest addition called ' Twilight ' the Vampire story continues. Here several adaptations are noted to previous blood sucking, night crawling creatures. For instance, they no longer keep to the night, but can walk about during the day. They are no longer flesh tearing, ghouls who patiently wait for a ripe throat to rip open. Indeed, these new young Vampires are interestingly more patient than their predecessors as they now can 'choose' to become vegetarian and stoically drink only animal blood. Furthermore, unlike previous film victims our movie heroine Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is a pro-modern girl, childishly independent, annoyingly self-confident and stubbornly assured. The drawn, pale and undernourished Hero on the other hand, is Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) a physically powerful but emotionally disturbed, family troubled hybrid. Unloved, uncertain yet seeking a lifetime companion, he explains to Bella of his origin from the fangs of Dr. Carlisle Cullen, (Peter Facinelli) the 'family' patriarch and his need for her. This first of the three part story of Twlight as adapted to the silver screen is confusing, hap-hazard, poorly directed and juvenile with an overdose of anemic romance. The acting is pedestrian with child-like cut-outs characters and it's difficult to understand why the settings are so confined. Still, there is some quality to the story, if one believes in compassionate Vampires. Otherwise, we'll have to wait for part two. ***",6,1,4,23 January 2010

Jubliiant over the English with an unexpected but major victory, the Zulu nation, under their Chiefton Cetshwayo move on to endanger and destroy the small contingent force at Rorke's Drift. The tiny station with a force of 100 British regulars and some fifty native contingents, are commanded by young and inexperienced Lt. Gonville Bromhead. It is his command the Zulus seek to decimate. Before Cetshwayo's warriors arrive, Bromhead is visited by an English engineer, Lt. John Chard (Stanley Baker) who's been ordered to build a bridge near the fort. Needless to say when the Zulus arrive, both men jockey for command to decide how to handle the oncoming threat. In the end, a joint co-operative effort and Chard's leadership face the daunting task of holding out against four thousand Zulu warriors. With the superior acting talents of Jack Hawkins, James Booth and Nigel Green as Colour Sgt. Frank Bourne, the film is a rousing battlefield confrontation. The acting is superior, the location scenery and the magnificence Zulu nation make for a dramatic classic. Being this is Michael Caine's first major movie, it notably establishes him as a legitimate Thespian. Sealing this classic is the timeless narrative voice of Sir. Richard Burton. *****",10,10,12,6 January 2007
The Transporter," ' I make it a practice to keep my promises. It's one of my rules! '
","This action packed story is written by Luc Besson and directed by Louis Leterrier and is exactly as Besson envisioned it. Jason Statham plays an ex-Special Forces soldier named Frank Martin. Living quietly in a secluded, and isolated house on the Mediterran. Frank was hoping he could retire without conflict. Unfortunately, his unusual private practice of hiring out as a special delivery man, puts that dream in jeopardy. The Movie is called ' The Transporter ' and relates Frank's story of being able to deliver anything from point one to point two, providing his simple rules concerning his employment and his safety are not violated. Such is the tale until a man code name ' Wall Street ' (Matt Schulze) requires Frank to deliver a certain 'special' package (Qi Shu) without question. His personal rules violated, Frank becomes involved in more that just a delivery. When the heavies decide to reciprocate with violence, Frank is introduced to Inspector Tarconi (François Berléand) who believes that Frank is certainly a 'Person of Interest.' The rest of the movie becomes a fun filled adventure of high flying street chases, explosions and physical action involving Martial arts of the best kind. The result becomes the basis or foundation for future films in like manner or a series as I certainly would be interested in seeing more. Jason Statham is certainly the right actor for this movie, one that you certainly want to see more of. Excellent film and readily recommended. ****",8,2,3,16 April 2012
Lawrence of Arabia," ' Nothing Changed at Dara, . . He was The Same Man! '
","The true story of T.E.Lawrence is hidden somewhere inside his personal memoirs. For the adventure-seeking Englishman from Oxfordshire, the Middle East was a land so remote from his that surely a man could become a hero, if he found the right location or conflict. Lawrence himself was a self taught expert in many of his interests. Having graduated from prestigious places, made him even more sought after by authorities, both academic and military. The film ' Lawrence of Arabia ' is laced with many actual events taken from Lawrence's own accounts, and it's difficult to separate fact from fiction. That is not really important for the Hollywood version in which Peter O'Toole plays T.E. Lawrence with such uncanny precision, the character overlaps the actual man. To add to the authenticity are the supporting actors such as Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal who is superb in his part. Anthony Quinn is Auda abu Tayi and is so convincing, many actual Arabs on the set accepted him as one. The main actor who gain hundreds of accolades while filming is Omar Sharif who plays Sheriff Ali. Jack Hawkins plays, General Edmund Allenby and Anthony Quayle is Colonel Brighten. The Turkish General is played by none other than Jose Ferrer. Claude Rains is the sly and slippery French minister Mr. Dryden. Arthur Kennedy is the American Newspaperman Jackson Bentley, seeking a story for his readers. When one views the film, it cannot but overwhelm as the vast but beautiful desert scenery and dramatic events convince the audience this film is fantastic in breath and scope. So highly recommended, it has achieved Classic status. ****",9,2,5,14 October 2008
Cars," Life in the Fast Lane
","This is an amusing film about cars. That cars are the subject and main ingredient is to say that icing on a cake is mere frosting. This is Disney's tribute to racing legends, enthusiasts, pit crews and aficionados animated to instill human viewers with worthy traits about living, learning and competing in and out of the fast lane. Within the speedy story is a moral obligation about achievements, success, honor and respect in general. How one is treated and vice versa, how we treat others, even if we are made of metal. Each of the autos in the film 'CARS' has a unique identity and is brought to life by a plethora of legendary voices. Consider for example names like Paul Newman as 'Doc Hudson', Michael Keaton as 'Chick Hicks', Cheech Marin as 'Ramone' and Jay Leno as 'Jay Limo' lines the star studded film with superb talent. Added to them are legendary racing names like, Dale Earnhardt Jr, and Richard Petty and of course Owen Wilson as the voice of Lightening McQueen. The result is nothing short of a fabulous tale, creating an endearing worthwhile film for the entire family. ****",8,5,7,19 May 2007
JFK," ' The Organizing Principal of any Society is for War '
","The murder of President John F. Kennedy on November 22nd. 1963 was perhaps the greatest tragedy to have visited the United States of America. The question was asked of young and old alike, 'Where were you when you heard, They Just Shot President Kennedy?' There are many theories concerning the assassination of so beloved a popular president, but none that has truly satisfied the listening public. In this film called ' J. F. K ' director Oliver Stone attempts to explain the reason for Kennedy's death and the cover up which followed. With the use of great actors such as Kevin Costner, Jack Lemmon, Walter Mathau, Ed Asner, Joe Pesi, Tommy Lee Jones and a dozen others, Stone's monumental task is seen for what it is, A Classic Work of Art. It's true, the American public will never uncover the truth behind the actual killing, but this film does allow for a better understanding of who might have profited from the great man's death. Audiences across the nation are given the hidden agenda and the men responsible for their cowardly deed. This three hour movie explains in meticulous detail of how the assassination was carried out and how The Warren Report botched the investigation. There are many reasons why we will never know, but one thing remains true, those presidents who are not as popular or loved by the public as President Kennedy, need never fear the magic bullet. This movie becomes part of our history and a living legacy towards a final tribute to John F. Kennedy.",8,2,10,15 May 2012
2012," ' The Mayans were right, Danny Glover should have called Mel Gibson '
","According to the Mayan Calander, the first Sunday of November should have fallen on the 5th and the Japanese should have destroyed only five of the Nine Battleships. They instead attacked on Sunday, December 7th and sank all nine. This error of history proved to doomsday predictors the Mayan system of astronomy was off by eight hundred years. In this futuristic movie called ' 2012 ' the end of the world as we know it should end on this date. Well except for the date, little if anything went wrong with the movie. Watching the film within the surround sound system of a Cina-Plex theater, the entire movie was an exciting, fantastic thrill-ride on steroids and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting, the assembled cast, the wonderful CGI-effects, the volcanic explosions, the crumbling earth, toppling buildings, world wide catastrophic flooding and doomsday happenings made this incredible movie a monumental visual success. The story as we see it has John Cusack playing writer Jackson Curtis, who predicted the world's end in a book entitle 'Farewell Atlantis.' Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Adrian Helmsley a scientific adviser to the president who having read the book has concluded the government should listen to him. Oliver Platt is Carl Anheuser, the Political adviser to the president and is superb in that role. Woody Harrelson plays Charlie Frost a radio host and doomsday prophet. Danny Glover is President Thomas Wilson who believes mankind waited too long to hear the truth. John Billingsley is wonderfully serious as Professor West. With a supreme effort in direction, this movie will easily become a Sci-Fi award winner. The special effects will also make this an all time Classic and a milestone for John Heard in his career. Enthustically recommended. *****",8,2,4,20 June 2011
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-Out Originality
","Ever get the feeling while watching a movie, the producers are growing complement and you can predict what's coming next? Such films like Rocky XII, the second or third Dirty Dozen, The last of the Dirty Harry stories, the Final Star Wars saga. they're all Representatives of Film Fatigue. Well that's what you'll get with X Men, The Last Stand. It isn't that the film isn't interesting, it is! But when you start seeing the Good Guys lose, the film starts to imitate the comics. I'm not saying that's bad either, it's good, but I suspect a set up. Stan Lee is an exceptional storyteller, but it's sneaky when a particular character or two is bumped off, right away. That implies a comeback is in the wings. Consider how Lucus did it in the original Star Wars when Darth Vader is flung into the spacial abyss. Neat trick, but necessary for a sequel. Here, two X-Men, join one already dead, or we viewers thought was dead. That smacks of a set up. How often do heroes have to destroy Freddy on Elm Street, Jason, or Michal Myers? The dam monsters just don't want to die. Good for money milking producers, but bad for viewers who seek originality. Now here we have, X-Men returning from the dead and this time joining the Bad guys in, yes, you guessed it, world conquest. Not original, but expected. Despite the fact we got mutants coming out of the woodwork and amassing into an army, the director sees fit to kill them off by the hundreds and in a variety of ways including one which eliminates their powers altogether just by contact. If you're interested in seeing leftover mutants from Star Trek, Star Wars, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or other fantasy sites, this film is for you. If you're not that shallow, read a book. About the only redeeming character from the entire show, I give you Ian McKellen as Magneto. At least, we know he's originally sincere in his madness. ***",6,2,4,11 October 2006
Good Will Hunting," Hell and the Lonely genius
","When searching for intellectual success and humanistic relationships between life and career, there is a simple formula which works for a few people. It is an equation which reads, Superior intellectual equals power, but results in pain and isolation. Such is the story of Will Hunting, superbly played by Matt Damon. Born with a I. Q. Genius, the young man seeks friends and mathematical challenges alike. Consequently when he finds either, he attacks one and embraces the other. As a result, he lives in a world of turmoil and volatile possibilities. Unable to tolerate authoritative or academic hypocrisy, he armors himself with the sword and shield of intellectual arrogance and gives battle to anyone and everything around him. What troubles him the most is the dark pain of abuse in his youth and it is here he is most vulnerable. Robin Williams who portrays Dr. Sean Maguire give one of his most stirring performances as a sensitive and compassionate psychiatrist. Equally matched as they are adroit, the two battle in an emotional arena, each seeking to fathom the other. The result? The creation of a truly remarkable film. ****",9,3,9,10 November 2005
Schindler's List," ' I'm afraid your quite mistaken, that is not snow, but the ashes of Human Beings '
","Too often the history of the Second World War concentrates on the massive destruction between the countries involved. It is true nearly 25 million people were killed, but the most horrendous tally in human cost was suffered by a single race and they were European Jews. Anyone who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well. There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it's simply ludicrous to try. In this film ' Schinder's List ', director Steven Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so many notable qualities, it's difficult to say which illuminated it the most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions, on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept Schindeler's files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn't find two who would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a Classic in every sense of the word. *****",10,30,51,11 September 2009
I Am Legend," ' The Night Creatures vs The last Man on Earth '
","In nineteen sixty four, the immortal Vincent Price, made a futuristic film called 'the Last Man on Earth.' It was so well received by fans of Price, that it was hailed as a classic. In 1971, the late Charleston Heston did a remake of the Richard Mathenson novel entitled 'The Omega Man', where he fought Anthony Zerbe. Here we are in 2007 and have yet another attempt of the horror classic rechristened, 'I Am Legend.' The story has changed little and in essence remains the tale of a dedicated doctor Robert Neville (Will Smith) who is challenged by a world destroying virus. Having eliminated 90% of the humans on the planet Earth, what little remains of the human species are little more than sun-fearing ghouls. While the rabies infected enemy seeks his lab and base of operations, Neville seeks their nest where he hopes to destroy the last of their monstrous race. In the 1964 version, Price seemed to acknowledge his lonely fate, in 1971, Heston took solace with an African American who became his partner. In this final version, Alice Braga plays Anna who tries to convince Neville of a 'survivor' colony which he finds hard to believe. It makes for a good follow-up to the earlier versions and all three should belong to those who enjoy a good scary story. ****",8,1,2,30 July 2008
The Man Who Would Be King," ' When Alexander the Great left to the East, he promised he'd send his son, You're him '
","Alexander the Masadonian left many a temple to his followers in the hopes they would remember him. That in fact, is what happened as modern people have sought his legacies in many of the countries he conquered. In our modern time, Director John Huston, using his own script, did just that with this incredible movie, entitled ' The Man who would be King. ' Using Rudyard Kipling (Christopher Plummer) as the capstone of this tale, he relates how Two English ex-soldiers, (Sean Connery and Michael Caine and a guide, named Billy Fish (Saeed Jaffrey) journey to far off Kafiristan, to establish their own kingdom. Traveling across the treacherous, snowy mountainous terrain of Afghanistan, they enter the country of Kafiristan. There, they ply their trade as experienced British soldiers and slowly work their way to the riches of Alexander. All goes well, until they are discovered not to be Alexander's children and must now face the wrath of the local peoples. The movie is impressive with wondrous scenes and exciting action scenes. For an audience, this movie contains all the elements of a good dramatic story and the cast is there to insure that it does so right up to the ending of the film. This movie is recommended to anyone seeking an adventurous tale as only Kipling could tell it. One will expect it to become a Classic in due time. ****",8,2,4,9 April 2011
Unknown," ' A Spy is a spy with his realities in a black briefcase '
","' Cognito Ergo Sum ' . . . . 'I think, . . Therefore I am. ' This has been a catch phrase which spells out the proof of a man. In this film, Liam Neeson, plays Dr. Martin Harris a bio-scientist who has an important conference to attend to in Berlin, Germany. However, a series of small accidents conspire to rob him of his name, his wife and his life as he knew it. Following an automobile accident in a frozen river, our hero discovers, he is missing four days and that who he thought he was is no longer true. Instead, his wife states she has never seen him before and that she is really married to another Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn). With that revelation, Neeson is challenged to learn who he is, why is someone impersonating and why are they trying to kill him. With similarities to 'The Man who knew too much' and the Bourne Identity, This film is set on a fast paced Roller-Coaster ride, with harrowing car chase scenes, serious drama and explosive excitement. This movie is a superior addition to our growing collection. Diane Kruger, January Jones and Frank Langella as Rodney Cole make for a fine cast and a worthwhile endeavor. Well worth a trip to the theater. Recommended. ****",8,2,4,26 June 2011
Gran Torino," ' I know of Life and Death, But then Life doesn't haunt you like death does '
","As Clint Eastwood's life progresses one can see the toll it has taken in his movies. In his youth, death was a trademark. Now in the twilight years, he seems to have brought out the humanitarian in him. In this film called ' Grand Torino ' Eastwood plays a retired auto worker, content to live out his life as a ill tempered curmudgeon, misunderstood by neighbors and family. His sole wish in life is to be left alone with his dog. Unfortunately, his neighborhood is infested with Asian foreigners, some of which live alongside him. As he nears the end of his life, he observes the youth gangs in his neighborhood have little manners and thus constantly invade his peace. That is until one boy is caught trying to steal his one remaining possession, a Grand Ford Torino. Dodging the gangs is difficult and Eastwood's character reluctantly accepts the boy as a pupil and tried to inject his life's philosophy into the troubled youth. As a result, the elders of the boy reciprocate with kindness. This allows Eastwood to galvanize the neighborhood into a merging caring collective which produces an unexpected result. A remarkable film and one which supposedly is Eastwood's last. An excellent tribute for a single lifetime as Eastwood Produced and directed it. Recommend ****",8,3,8,12 June 2009
The Hurt Locker," ' There are people out in the dark, who are laughing at us '
","American invaded the country of Iraq for several fictitious reasons. To-date, none have ever been substantiated. As a result, some 30,000 civilians have been killed by American military forces. Moreover, 5000 American casualties have been attributed to this unnecessary conflict, not counting other collateral injuries. When these veterans return home, there is no well deserved homecoming for them. This is due to the fact America has yet again sustained another lost war. This movie is called ' The Hurt Locker ' and is the gutsy story of a courageous group of men in a Bomb Disposal Unit. Jeremy Renner plays SSG William James, a thrill seeking, danger oriented, fear-less soldier who lives for the excitement of the job. Anthony Mackie is Sgt. JT Sanborn a realistic soldier who accepts his dangerous role, adhere's to policy, hoping to eventually have a son when he returns home. Brian Geraghty is Spc. Owen Eldridge, who is quite aware of his daily mortality and fear of being shipped home in a box. Together, they face the experienced, illusive and lethal enemy with exceptional courage, each cognizant, that time is not really on their side. With the additional talents of Hollywood greats like Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and David Morse, this film should have become a run-away winner. Instead, there were segments in the film which appeared sluggish, out of sequence or amateurishly directed. Too often, the serious story became child-like as if it were an arcade game. Dramatic tension in the guy-oriented movie, became talk-heavy. The few exciting scenes appeared strained, over-worked and clumsy. In all what should have been a memorable and articulate message of why men fight, became a docu-drama and a poor journalistic endeavor destined for the library of obscurity. ***",7,1,4,24 February 2010
K-19: The Widowmaker," ' If we cannot prevent the explosion, our actions may well trigger WWIII '
","The Cold War began in the 1950's and lasted long into the year 2000. During these very tense and turbulent eras, tension between the Soviet Union and the U.S. nearly bankrupt both nations and their treasuries. In the end little was solved but their legacies left an indelible mark on both Countries. Among the Russian Navy's most notable disasters is the subject of this film. From an original story written by Louis Nowra and a screenplay by Christopher Kyle, this movie is Entitled ' K-19: The Widowmaker ' and it reveals the true story of Russia'a first Neclear Submarine disaster at sea. In 1959 on the maiden voyage of the K-19, Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) is assigned to make a series of tests concerning his ship. His second in command is Capt.Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) who believes his commander's appointment was political and that he should have been the appointed Capt. Although much animosity between the two creates unrest among the crew, the voyage begins well enough until they are further ordered by Moscow's command officer Marshal Zelentson (Joss Ackland) to begin patrolling off the coast of America. Upon arrival, the K-19 suffers a rupture in one of the cooling systems near the nuclear reactor, endangering the nuclear War-heads. With the ship in dangering of suffering a nuclear explosion, the Capts and crew struggle to find solutions to their worsen predicament, which could result in all out Nuclear War. The acting between the cast and the main stars is incredible and strengthens the fact that Russians like Americans both have men of superior courage and patriotic zeal when danger is threatening them, their ship and their country. Excellent story and well recommended to all audiences. ****",8,2,4,15 October 2010
Meet Joe Black," ' Take it easy, else, you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation '
","In 1934, the late great Fredrick March completed a film called ' Death Takes a Holliday.' Splendid and innovative for it's day, it gave one pause on the briefness of life and it's singular, ultimate end. In 1998, a remake of the earlier Classic was made and called ' Meet Joe Black. ' Having seen 'Holiday' I was prepared for it's film resurrection. The gist of the story as written by Ron Osborn is that Death witnesses a sudden and tragic street accident which takes the life of a young man exiting a coffee shop. Assuming his body, Death visits William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) a successful tel-la-communication executive near his 65th birthday and strikes a deal. In exchange for Parrish educating him on the profound sensory delicacies of life, Death will allow him to live until his 65th birthday. The deal is set, until Death discovers he has fallen in love with Susan Perrish (Claire Forlani); William's younger daughter. Another obstacle for William is Drew (Jake Weber) an ambitious, devious and ruthless executive board member who is trying to undermined and destroy all he has built. Unwittingly William's close friend and confident Quince (Jeffrey Tambor) believes Drew and helps to remove and retire Mr. Parrish. The dark plot of this film fills three full hours, but if one follows the fluid direction of Martin Brest, it evolves into a sincere, sympathetic and romantic love story within an innocent, often humorous awakening for the Lord of the Underworld. Despite this being a re-make, it's final result will be seen as a superb recreation and both Hopkins and Pitt are experienced Thespians at their very best. Recommended. ****",8,4,5,4 April 2010
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," ' I know who I am, but it feels like I'm some one else '
","This movie has a great many innovations but it seems like there is way too much of a good thing when it comes to romance. So much so that one could easily decry that this is a Chick movie and destroys the Guy elements in it's efforts. Sure there is much excitement, action and story line, but it gets buried in too many branches of the Spiderman myth. Andrew Garfield returns as Spider-Man / Peter Parker and Emma Stone is Gwen Stacy his girlfriend. Theirs is a cursed relationship but they do try and hold it together with a lot of web action sequences. In addition, a new villain, Jamie Foxx appears as Electro who I think was a waste of great talent as the director cloaked him behind way too much makeup which we lose during his transformation. However were it not for the dark settings, audiences could keep track of it all. The best part of this movie is the reappearance of Stan Lee, the creator of the Marvel characters. Sally Field also returns as Aunt May Peter Parker's remaining relative. The most interesting part of this movie waits till it's conclusion and then it awakens audiences with a new villain called Rhino for a the movie itself is concern, it remains a let down and I hope the next will be more cohesive. ****",8,1,3,22 August 2014
Patton," ' Lying naked in the sun with the dead at the battle of Carthage, I was there '
","It is rare, but it happens an acclaimed actor will often become so ingrained with a role, that whenever the movie is brought up for discussion, one immediately discusses the actor as well. Thus it is so with this 1970 film called ' Patton. ' George C. Scott has proved himself versatile in many roles, but his career is crowned here with the role of a lifetime. The movie does not cover the life of Patton, but only the War time segment. Beginning with the North Africa campaign, Scott demonstrates the flamboyant army general who despite his Christian beliefs, also believed in his vault of past lives or reincarnations. Although, Patton had a great ability to wage war, he suffered from an inability to control his opinion. Whenever, he accomplished some extraordinary feat in battle, he would often follow it up by saying or doing something which would cause him great embarrassment. One example is his defeat of Erwin Rommel's 10th elite Africa corps in battle, then following it up by slapping a common soldier in front of medical witnesses. Always claiming he had defeated the Desert Fox, one wonders if he could have done it at the beginning of Rommel's campaign. Nevertheless, throughout the war, Patton would be able to snare the lion's share of the wartime glory only to have it snatched away by his arrogant social behavior. Still the movie itself is a fine testament to the controversial general who gained the respect of his men, staff as well as his enemies only to die in what many called an ignominious death. The film is further enhanced by noted actors like Karl Malden as Gen. Omar Bradley and Karl Vogler as Field Marshal Erwin Rommel. This is one film which not only stands as a living tribune to Patton and George C. Scott but a definite military Classic for any collection. ****",9,3,4,20 August 2009

","The greatest magician of the 20th century was Eric Weiss, otherwise known as The Great Houdini. As was his practice, he often explained, what he did was not to trick people, only to entertain them. He was good at his craft, and despite his plea, he was still thought of as the greatest magician of all time. His famed career and that of this film, 'The Illusionist' are to say the least, similar and remarkable. For Houdini, his only ambition was to enthrall audiences. In this film, we have a young man, The Great Eisenheim, (Edward Norton) who discovers his talent may be a way to win and hold the heart of a beautiful princess, named Sophie (Jessica Biel) whom he loves. Obtructions to their happiness include, Crown Prince Leopold, (Rufus Sewell) who plans to use Sophie to cement his claim to Hungry. There is also Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) who will do his best so his employer, the prince gets his way. To say the audience will be entertained is to underscore Edward Norton's ability to conjure up more than is expected. Prepare to be mesmerized to the very end of the film.

Suffice to say both the visual confrontations, which fills the screen with an on going intergalactic conflict and the exemplary story which brings the several groups together to fight the invading metallic giants. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the small town hero who along with his girlfriend Mikaela Banes, befriend the Leader. The success for the believability of this incredible movie, owes much to Jon Voight, who plays as Defense Secretary John Keller.

","Soldiers have been fighting since time immemorial. Equally long has been their history of military conduct in the field. Among the stories of men in combat is, at some point the established proper rules of behavior. As a result, a nation's flag becomes a symbol of the soldier's code of conduct. Too many men have paid the price to disgrace it in our modern era. Among the various branches of service, the U.S. Marine Corps, has created a plethora of heroic memories which exemplify their valiant attributes. Their courage have bequeathed to their country a magnificence unparalleled among the nations. That is the stage for this movie called ' Rules of Engagement. ' A decorated Marine Col. Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) has retired after an illustrious career and now seeks peace and quiet for his retiring years. Unfortunately, a fellow Marine, one Col. Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) has been ordered to rescue an American Ambassador (Ben Kingsley) from a besieged embassy in Yemen which is under hostile and armed mob attack. When his men come under direct fire from snipers and an armed crowd, some his men are killed. Without hesitation Childres orders return fire and eighty civilians are killed.

","During World War two, as with any war, treasure is where you find it. Few of the top brass ever shared or made public their ill gotten loot. Nevertheless, some opportunistic Allies and greedy but equally devious Germans realized if one discovered any treasure found in the field, the one thing necessary to keep it; was secrecy. In this film, an ex-Lieutenant, now private Kelly (Clint Eastwood), inadvertently captures a Nazi Colonel and takes him to the American lines. The initial purpose for the prisoner was to answer a few questions about an upcoming German town called Nancy to MSgt. Big Joe (Telly Savalas). However during a personal interrogation, Kelly learns the German was carrying instructions for the transportation and smuggling of Nazi gold. Learning its in a bank 30 miles behind enemy lines, Kelly decides to go for it. Help is assured when opportunists like supply SSgt. Crapgame (Don Rickles) Sgt. Oddball (Donald Sutherland), Moriaty (Gavin MacLeod), Little Joe (Stuart Margolin) and the rest of the platoon all volunteer to go for the gold. The bad parts to the scheme are multiple hurtles. One, the distance to the town is guarded by the German army. Second a Gung Ho Army commander named Maj. Gen. Colt plans to arrive at the same town with the entire division before Kelly and his private force get there. Finally, there are three awesome nearly invincible Tiger Tanks and 30-to-40 special troops guarding the bank where the gold is stored. To the general audience this movie is not only apt to become a military milestone, but due to its superb theme song, by the Mike Curb Congreation, will also become a lasting musical memory. The acting is superior, the wartime action extremely entertaining and the picture as a whole is nothing short of Classic. Highly Recommended to all audiences. *****",10,1,2,15 January 2009

' In this future, the women of the planet have been made sterile (In the book, it's the men) and are unable to conceive a child. The countries become a battleground between the fanatical right who blame it on troublesome extremists and the lunatic left who blame it on terrorists. While their confrontation spreads across nations, the basis for their fears is that the populations of the earth have been condemned to extinction as no children will ever be born. Into this insane world is a secretive group who have developed a hopeful beginning called The Human Project. Their efforts are condemned by the government and their allies target everyone who tries to regenerate the population. One man who believes in the Human project is Theo Faron (Clive Owen) who learns of one girl called Kee (Clare Ashitey) who is pregnant. Seeking refuge a rebel friend puts him on a hazardous, adventurous roller-coaster ride which takes him in and out of Gunfights, ambushes, assassinations, concentration camps, street fights and armed clashes between roving armies. Along the way he seeks out advice from a once promising cartoonist called Jasper, (Michael Caine) who has become a hermit. The poison world they all inhibit is a gloomy, smog-shrouded, pollution soaked and virus infected environment seemingly on the brink of destruction. The film is terrifyingly real and few would ever look forward to the future if this is what it resembles. Excellent rendition of the book. ****",7,1,9,4 September 2009
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," A Fearful Dream
","The United States is a great place for the creation of dreams. It's citizens are privileged to seek fame or fortune or to alter those of others. Those fragile fortunes always stride hand in hand with the fear of losing them. In the 1950's when the country was riding the high road of prosperity, Americans were enjoying the benefits of the second world war. With little to fear, it was left to the government to create one. It was called the 'Red scare' or Communism. Most Americans were too complacent to worry about it. Thus it was left to one man to not only terrorize us with that fear, but to cultivate it. That individual was Joseph MaCarthy who hitched his star to a threat not of his creation, but his decision to feed, nurture and manipulate it to destroy the lives, careers and dreams of many citizens. In this remarkable film, audiences are given the rare opportunity to witness the classic confrontation between the Junior senator from Wisconsin and the controversial, chain-smoking hero of CBS, one Edward R. Murrow (supurbly play by David Strathairn.) The film is in Black and white as were the issues of the day. Noted for it's caricatures of the CBS news staff, the film pointedly reveals the uncertainties, triumphs and tragedies of the times. A courageous attempt to remind modern audiences that our present dreams and fears are no less precarious. With the government adroitly using the fears of global terrorism, a man like Edward Murrow is not only welcomed, but long overdue. ****",9,3,5,31 March 2006
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," ' As for Darkness? I invented Darkness: . . . . . Adolf Hitler! '
","The world of the Nazi machine was driven in one and only one direction, towards hell. There are few films which can accurately describe or even come close to the 'Final Solution' or the full horror this maniacal regime created. In this film ' The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas ' director Mark Herman and writer John Boyne have in their own way taken their audience to the precipice which was the Holocaust and allows us a chance to feel it's monstrous presence. The story as taken from the Boyne novel is of a German Officer (David Thewlis, superb acting) who with a promotion is assigned to be the Commandant of Aushwitz Concentration camp. There his innocent son Bruno (Asa Butterfield) befriends a Jewish boy, named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) who is the same age. Unknow to his family, Bruno becomes curious as to the real world behind the barbed wire and decides to learn more. The movie has a slow, but ever serious gravity which pulls the audience into the Nazi world behind the wire and it's drama is assured once we are confined within it. A must see film for anyone interested in living the nightmare. Highly recommended! ****",9,2,3,30 May 2010
The Imitation Game," ' Never Lie to someone who is expecting you to Lie '
","There are many stories of people who helped win World War Two. Among them are the unknown agencies who help bring about the Nazi downfall. One of them was called MI6. Given the nearly impossible task called ' Enigma ', their job was to unravel it's secret messages send by their superiors to their military forces in the oceans of the world. This serious drama is called ' The Imitation Game. ' It's main star is ( Benedict Cumberbatch and Alex Lauther) who plays Allen Turin. In this role, which highlights their efforts of his special group, illustrates the difficulty they faced in trying to break the German's Crytic codes. At the same time in his life, Turing reveals his own secret to the audience of being Homosexual at a time when it was Illegal and could very well send him to prison. This is a very profound film and the cast are extremely well selected as they deliver a well-crafted story. While giving a star rated performance, Cumberbatch, delivers much of what is expected of a lonely isolated man who is forever afraid of being found out in a place where secrets are expected to be revealed. Admiration must given to those who make up the cast. Brilliant and inspirational is the result. Well done!! I suspect this movie will become a Classic. ****",9,2,7,3 June 2016
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Revenge and the Black Manba
","Comas are a deep sleep wherein a victim is neither living nor dead. The mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there. However, an ancient proverb states, that 'if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living, then woe betide those who put it there.' Such is the premise of Kill Bill. Once part of an elite group of world wide assassins, 'B.B', the victim, {Uma Thurman} awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her. Throughout the rest of the film, viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the world's most venomous snakes. Not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered, ' Black Manba' as B.B. was code named, (The deadliest snake) goes after each of the assassins. It has been suggested, were Bruce Lee to have lived, this vehicle would have been his. Instead, the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action Director Quinton Tarentino. From the first to the last, exciting sub-plots and well-choreographed martial arts scenes give this film it's special quality. The main target of B.B.'s revenge is of course none other than Master (Kung Fu) David Carradine as Bill. It is he and his 'Snake' team which consists of Lucy Liu who plays O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and Michael Madson who now become the intended targets. Interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex, exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action. In the end, what can be said of Kill Bill One? If this film is fantastic, I can't wait for part II. (of which there is) Excellent. ****",7,2,5,5 July 2006
Clash of the Titans," ' Despite your reluctance, you were and always will be the son of Zeus'
","Audiences across America have waited for years to see a remake of 'clash of the Titans', the reason for that is because the original 1981 version was absolutely incredible. There were a few minor flaws in the original, but audiences hoped they would be refined for this update version. The title is the same ' Clash of the Titans ' and since it stars Liam Neeson as Zeus, we figured, how could it fail? In this film we have Sam Worthington playing Perseus but one look at the rugged actor, tells us this movie is not going to be based on good looks, but a tempest tossed story filled with stark Black images, dark pitiful creatures and gritty, marsh monsters. Although, there are sufficient fiery, exciting scenes, filled with arching volcanoes and incredible CGI created creatures (I liked the BLACK Pegasus), director Louis Letterier allowed the story to be filmed too close to Hades instead of glorious Olympus. As a result, horror, tragedy and beautiful ugliness are the paint brushes of his canvas. The storyline is further burdened with too many options and no central resolution. Still, the final caparison will be up to the forgiving audience, but as far as this reviewer is concern, I liked the original. ***",7,2,3,3 August 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Sweet and Sour
","It has always been a mystery to me as to why movie makers continuously seek to RE-make classic films. The original if done well, earned it's special niche, fulsome praise and the loyalty of it's viewers. In addition, it also established itself as the standard by which all others will to be compared with. Try as they may, few remakes even come close to the original, others fall well short of the mark. Thus is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with Johhny Depp. There is much a magical talent like Depp can add to a film. In this movie however, he does not add, but subtracts. His humor is far too subtle and overly serious for the part. The original with Gene Wilder is more exciting, colorful and enjoyable. This version begins and ends with a dark parody of the original. The film lacks heart and direction and too often the viewer seeks familiar ground only to find it wanting. In conclusion, this version is a sad reflection of the original and not to be taken as anything but a crude copy of it's intended. A great waste of both time and talent. *",4,1,2,14 August 2006
Quiz Show," ' If I already know the Question, is knowing the answer, really cheating? '
","From exceptional Actor/Director, Robert Redford, comes this insightful but true story called ' Quiz Show. ' Based on the book written by Richard N. Goodwin, it entails the revealing truth concerning the quiz shows of Early Television. Taken from the pages of Goodwin's book it relates how a weekly prize winner but, later disgruntle loser, like Herbie Stempel (John Turturro) a Jewish contestant became an overnight success, winning a great deal of fame and fortune on a weekly T.V. show called '21.' Loosing ratings, he is selected by network corporate sponsors and studio heads to be replaced by a youthful handsome, more personable and attractive contestant named Charles Van Doren (Ralph Fiennes). Reluctant to know the inner secrets of the game, Van Doren, is surprised to learn he is to be given the answer to the hidden questions before they are asked, he initially refuses. However due to the flux of fame and money, he succumbs to pressures and plays the rigged game. However, when government oversight official Dick Goodwin, (Rob Morrow) begins to investigate suspected fraud, everyone involved feigns ignorance of possible cheating. Through diligence and persistent questioning, Goodwin eventually discovers multiple layers of deception and clumsy attempts of corruptions and makes a good attempt to bring down N.B.C.'s executives. The movie is superbly directed and the cast is equally superior in their quest to excel. As it result this movie becomes a Classic and the cast which includes Paul Scofield, David Paymer and Martin Scorcese makes it what it is, a winner. Easily recommended. ****",8,1,1,26 April 2014
The Dark Knight," ' You're Gonna Blackmail a man who pummels his enemies to death '
","When Bob Kane created The Batman in the early 30's he had no idea he would become world wide popular. Yet here he is with a plethora of films, plays, books and action figures and many other venues are continuing to expand. Yet it is the newest film which had the attention of the audience today. The newest movie is called ' The Dark Knight ' and it stars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman. When you sit and watch the movie, be prepared for a launching into action and dark drama. The ride of total action is what gives this offering it's appeal. From one explosive scene to the next, an audience member encounters nothing short of a 'run-on' roller-coaster ride movie. So much action is given, it becomes nearly impossible to say when the sequence begins and where the dramatic event ends. Heath Ledger, plays 'The Joker' a homicidal maniac who takes pleasure in saying, he doesn't want money or fame, just the knowledge that no one can understand why he is so crazy. Aaron Eckhart plays Harvey Dent / Two-Face, a good guy who slips into the dark side. Michael Caine, reprises his role as loyal Alfred Pennyworth. Gary Oldman as James Gordon and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox return as stanch supporters of the Batman. If there was a single aspect which I would critique about this movie, I would point out that the facial make-up of the Joker, is to say the least, haphazard and sloppy. He looks like he put his make up on with a large wide paint brush. Other than that, the film is so loaded with action, it's difficult to ignore the length it will go to keep the audience's attention. Great Movie though. ****",7,2,8,4 October 2008
Blood Diamond," ' This Is Africa, don't mistake it for Paradice '
","When one visits any country in the world, you have a choice. You can see the sanitized, section of a community, which is a collection of the neat and pretty places touted by the chamber of commerce or you can ask for and be shown the 'ugly' side of the native habitat. Of course when you do, you may witness things you don't ever wish to see. That is what happens when you view the film ' Blood Diamond '. It's not only the director's raw evisceral take on Sierra Leone and the illegal diamond trade, but unfortunately the present picture in Africa. Yet, it's the courageous director who takes on what society at large wishes to remain ignorant of. Once the viewer sits down to watch this touching and unfortunately all too realistic film, he must also prepare himself for a painful reminder of mankind's dark and evil nature. The story is of Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou) an ordinary Africaner, living peacefully in a village in Sierra Leone, with Dia Vandy (Kagiso Kuypers), his son and family when a civil war reaches them. Enslaved and sent to toil in a diamond mine, he cannot believe all the tragedy which has taken place. Enroute, he meets and is befriended by a opportunistic mercenary, named Danny Archer, (Leonardo DiCaprio) who learns, Vandy possesses valuable information on a priceless jewel which could insure Archer's lifelong dream, but may be the one chance which could secure his captive family's return. Together they are pursued by many factions. One is, Colonel Coetzee, (Arnold Vosloo) who also seeks the valuable find. Then there's, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) an American reporter seeking a way to expose the diamond merchants and their deadly human trade. Finally there is the civil war, the brutal officers and child-soldiers of the rebel army. Altogether, this film has much to offer, including some heartfelt stories from the characters themselves. ****",8,7,11,15 July 2007
Singin' in the Rain," ' Course he's missed you, He's been looking inside every cake for weeks'
","When asked which musical film I remember best, few if any can compare to this all time memory maker. 'Singing in The Rain' has it all. A simple but impressive story which winds itself through several decades of various films. Gene Kelly stars as Don Lockwood, a city hoofer who enjoys being a popular and noted 'silent' celebrity by everyone except Kathy Seldon (Debbie Reynolds) who rebuffs him by saying about movies, 'if you've seen one, you've seen them all.' His life long friend Cosmo Brown, played by (Donald O'Connor) is magically talented both singing and dancing which is nearly impossible for the obstacle in the picture, one Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen). When the studio discovers that silent pictures are obsolete, the director R.F. Simpson (Millard Mitchell) launches a new course for his cast, one which does not include Lamont. The movie is filled with many dance routines, which includes perhaps the most remembered song and dance number in Hollywood. I remember it well. Excellent film for any generation. ****",9,1,2,29 November 2008
Elysium," ' Do not be troubled, For you are in Elysium and you're already Dead '
","Neil Blomkamp wrote and directed this incredible movie called ' Elysium '. The title of the film refers to the Mythical Island of the Greeks. As referenced by Maximus Decimus Meridias in the Movie 'Gladiator', who says, ' If you find yourself riding in green fields, with the Sun on your face. Do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium and you're already Dead. ' Thus it is in this film our hero, Max (Matt Damon), who daily labors in an industrial factory, accidentally is exposed to a lethal dose of Radiation and is informed he has five days to live. It is Earth in the 22nd century and it's population, like now, has been divided between the Very rich and the very poor. Max is poor. Indeed, like the rest of the impoverished, he has one chance to survive, get to the orbiting satellite called Elysium where a medical machine can perform miracles and will cure everything. Unfortunately a powerful and ruthless governor named Delacourt (Jodie Foster) has no tolerance for undesirables like Max. In addition to Delacourt, there are others who can stop Max. There is for instance Kruger (Sharlto Copley) the powerful Mercenary who is hired and assigned to protect Elysium from illegal immigrants. It is a dark film but one which in incredibly exciting. Action is everywhere from the ground up. The movie is filled with tremendous explosive scenes, aerial combat and superb physical confrontations. A cohesive script allows the cast to play well against each other. Alice Braga, Diego Luna, Wagner Moura and William Fichtner as John Carlyle are excellent. It's equally interesting to see Jodie Foster playing a heavy for once. As such, I definitely recommend this movie to all. ****",8,1,3,3 January 2014
Taken," ' I have a very Special set of Skills, . . . and I will find and kill you '
","There is a very serious crime most prevalent in Europe, which is daily spreading across the globe. The crime is Human trafficking and it's tragic results can be seen on the evening news. Police often uncover the remains of missing victims, days, months and often years later. It is estimated that 10,000 victims are listed as missing, kidnapped or murdered every year and includes beautiful women, ignorant young girls and underage boys. That is the basis for this film called ' Taken! ' After retiring from the C.I.A. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is government spy learns his precious daughter, now 17, has been kidnapped and is on her way to being sold to wealthy sex merchants. Told he has 96 hours to find her, Mills put's his expertise to work and promises his adversaries he will learn who they are and eliminate them all. His many hindrances include his ex-wife and her new but rich husband. Vowing to find and retrieve his daughter, Mills will leave no stone unturned or friendship undisturbed including his old French Police friend Stuart (Xander Berkeley). Neeson is in find form and artistic element as he gives the surreal impression nothing will stop him until he succeeds. Love for his daughter, morphs the aging spy into a fanatical lunatic, turned juggernaut. High speed chases and plenty of energetic physical action are the essence of this highly charged movie. Recommended for all Neeson fans. ****",7,2,4,11 July 2009
Alice in Wonderland," ' If you look closely at a mirror you will realize it has more than one reflection '
","Charles Dodgson wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll and his imaginative books have been christened by the world of literature as Classics. His most famous and enduring work written in 1865 is called ' Alice in Wonderland ' which by the way is the title of this movie. Although read mostly by young literary students, this particular film has a dark, shadowy, foreboding environ meant for adult audiences. Carroll's original story is of a twelve-year-old girl named Alice who follows a white rabbit down into a strange nonsensical world full of odd assortment of creatures. This latest version is decidedly updated from it's original synopsis. The original Walt Disney film had Kathryn Beaumont as Alice with Sterling Holloway as the Cheshire Cat. Now we have Tim Burton directing this more somber offering, with Mia Wasikowska playing Alice. Johnny Depp is the Mad Hatter with Stephen Fry as the disappearing Cat and Alan Rickman is recognized as the voice of the Caterpillar. The menacing Jabberwacky is played by accomplished character actor Christopher Lee. Attemping to forget the original and focusing on this 2010 version, one finds it interesting, assertive and whimsical. The fast background scenery is fantastically creative and more importantly action driven. The Idea of a mature, 18 year old warrior Alice is difficult to comprehend as she is not only to be married, but forced to accept a social standing and offered a traveling business venture as well. It's far from Carroll's original concept. Nevertheless, it's a movie for any who desires to join Alice in the modern world and far from the Looking Glass where she began. ****",7,2,3,13 June 2010
Avatar," ' On the Planet Pandora, you can actually dream of becoming someone else '
","In the magical world of director James Cameron, there lives a great genius. His repertoire of movies, lists some of Hollywood's most awesome cinematic adventures and this one will no doubt, crown all those fine achievements. In his ledger, are some astounding and certainly memorable films such as 'Apollo 13,' 'Abyss,' Titanic' and of course the futuristic 'Terminator.' All have made his name a household word. Here is yet another triumph for him and in this reviewer's opinion, his very best. The Movie is called ' AVATAR ' and even the name is mythic in nature. It's the story of a young wounded paraplegic Marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) who volunteers to replace his twin brother and become an Avatar, on a supposedly scientific expedition under the direction of Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver). Her tasks is to study the rich Eco-system of the planet, searching for a rare material called Unobtainum. This unique material is the primary reason why Joel Moore (Norm Spellman) and his powerful business conglomerate have enlisted the military. The armed force is under the direction of Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) a no nonsense, hard core officer who promises to destroy the indigenous population of the planet, if need be to secure the mining rights. Unaware of their destructive intentions, Jake's clandestine mission on the planet Pandora, is to integrated into the tribes and learn how the military can decimate them. However, Jake soon discovers, if he succeeds, he will become a willing participant in the outright slaughter and brutal murder of a spiritual and peaceful race. The entire movie is a trill ride of a lifetime. The planet Pandora contains a gigantic plethora of natural splendor, incredible vistas, wondrous mystical creatures and a cornucopia of lasting beauty which could only arise in the mind of James Cameron. With a superb supporting cast containing Zoe Saldana (The new Uhura of Star Trek), Laz Alonso and Wes Studi, I am not surprised it top the charts and won the highest honors as well as a world wide audience all of which will assure this film becomes a Classic for future generations. A remarkable milestone for all. Enthustically recommended for all audiences. *****",10,3,5,24 April 2010

Following his career, fans soon came to enjoy his speedy ability to deliver his dialog with precision and notable flair as he did in 'ten speed and brown shoe.' That is why many eagerly awaited this science-fiction role as the brilliant but unfortunate scientist Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) in the extraordinary new version film called 'The Fly.' Having completed most of the work on his secret new scientific invention, which he calls the tell-a-portal, he bumps into scientific journalist Veronica Quaife (Geena Davis).

Also unimpressed with the chosen subject and his work is her magazine editor Stathis Borans (John Getz) until he discovers that Brundle is a genius. Although they want his story, they both learn his machine has an unintended result when a insignificant fly is accidentally included to his tell-a-portal equation with tragic results. Down at the sub-atomic DNA level, both man and insect are genetically spliced and what emerges is a fantastic and powerful mutant.

Reservoir Dogs," ' War is an Argument which got out of hand '
","Director Quentin Tarantino has an exceptional ability to create action films like this one called 'Reservoir Dogs.' It is sure to rank among his very best. The script and it's dramatic storyline throughout the entire movie is a visual compendium of 'Waiting for Godot' meets 'Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.' Anyone seeing it for the first time is in for a real treat. The story is of an experienced gangster who attempts to create the perfect crime. Its simple enough, collect seven of the most professional and trustworthy men in the business, assign them code names, tell them just enough about the crime to do their part, snatch the haul, then rendezvous in a warehouse after the job and split the take. The men selected are top of the line actors like Lawrence Tierney as the Boss Joe Cabot, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Like the best laid plans, the unexpected was not included and therefor becomes the focus of a violent shouting match with guns. Between themselves, the heist should have worked, why it didn't has much to do with the body in the trunk (Kirk Baltz) and will have them at each other's throats trying to fathom the reason. The final segment of the film makes it the most exciting climax since the shootout of the Wild Bunch. With dramatic flair and an excellent, but violent dialog, this incredible film will become a Classic. ****",7,1,1,6 April 2009
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," ' Perfection is the only absolute worthy of denigration or destruction '
","There are many films which are sought after for serious consideration of art. In films such movies are rarely accepted as artistic rendering. Of course any listed work can be further critiqued as to literal substance or moral value. One example are the works of the famous French writer the Marquis De Sade which begins and ends with the survival of his written books. Although many directors from several countries have attempted their own interpretation of the Comte's work, few can adequately reach the darkest depths ascribed to the sexually licentious's dreams of the inmate imprisoned at the secluded asylum at Charenton. One director who attempted was Paolo Pasolini who gave the world this film entitled 'One hundred twenty days at Sadom.' The other name for it was 'Salo-Republic.' Anyone wishing to see this dark cinema, had better have a cast iron stomach as it gets awful black in the snake pit. I always believed I knew what perversion was until I watched this film. I have since learned what cinematic depravity is. Taken from the journals of the 15th century Marquis, this modern interpretation is recreated during the heyday of Nazi Germany and Mussolini's socialist period. Nevertheless, a group of sadistic aristocrats kidnap various 'perfect' young men and women, and subject them to the brutal nature of De Sade' violent manifesto. What is seen is nothing short of cruel sexuality gone mad. In short, this is one film which is not suited for the faint hearted. In fact, this is not a suitable movie for anyone not mentally dead. **",8,2,4,5 January 2009

","Out of the wondrous imaginative mind of Stanley Kubrick comes this erotic tale of successful doctor William Harford (Tom Cruise) who believes he and his beautiful wife (Nicole Kidman) are a modern uninhibited and sophisticated couple. That all changes when the pair pauses a moment in their sedate and upscale life to smoke a joint. The husband reviews their evening at a fancy ball and reveals he was hit on by a couple of gorgeous women, but had the strength and fortitude to resist their invitation and charms. Taking his cue, the wife reveals that she too was invited to a sexual rendezvous and considered it just another of the many flirts she daily encounters. In fact, she further reveals, she's often had several wild fantasies involving herself and a handsome ship's Captain. This awakens and disturbs the doctor who believes there is much more to the sexual world of his wife which he is not privy to. Intrigued by the possibilities, he begins a personal but dangerous Odyssey to discover the dark secret world of the sexually provocative. The question arises. Can one delve into the black depths of perversion without losing himself? Eyes Wide Shut is a spellbinding foray of spectral images, complete with an equally haunting theme. All in all, a strange but alluring film where one discovers that enlightenment comes not without a price. ****",8,5,9,12 July 2006

Still, it does not sit well with Emerson (David Oyelowo) the police Inspector. Odd characters along the way such as an shadowy but aging former Russian Prisoner and his henchmen, a group of murderous vicious thugs haunt Reacher's quest for answers. The film itself is a dark, but exciting race against time to fathom, the sniper's motive. Along the way, the audience is treated to the return of Academy award winner Robert Duvall and further introduced to the dark minds and motives of powerful individuals bent on profiting from the death of anyone who get's in their way.

The Da Vinci Code," The Expected One?
","It is a brutal, bizarre and ritualistic murder in a fashionable Parisian Meusum, which initiates notable director Ron Howard's sensational film, The Da Vinci Code. Based on Dan Brown's controversial book which purports to trace Jesus's Maravingian's blood line through the centuries on into the modern era. It begins with cryptologist Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) visiting France, lecturing and book signing when he is suddenly jolted into a dangerous and certainly puzzling high speed police chase which begins pin-ball style in the wet streets of Paris and flying across and into scenic Switzerland, Rome and even historic England. Accompanying, Langdon, is mysterious policewoman Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) who helps Hanks and learns to understand the mysteries of her own involvement. Chasing Langdon is Interpol Inspector Captain Bezu Fache, (convincly played by Jean Reno) who is seeking not only to capture the good doctor, but to destroy him and his quest. Adding to the murderous and intricate pursuit are church fanatics like (Paul Bettany ) as Silas and religious Zellots like the infamous Bishop Manuel Aringarosa (Alfred Molina). In addition there are other menacing arch-types like, Andre Vernet (Jürgen Prochnow) and superb arch-villain Sir Leigh Teabing, played to the hilt by Ian Mckellen. The film's fine casting holds up well enough, despite Hanks's long tooth appearance. Vintage film buffs can readily see this film suspiciously mimics National Treasure. Difference is Nicklas Cage sought lost treasure, whereas Hanks seeks only the Holy Grail. Still, the great cast lends credibility to a otherwise dubious storyline. All in all a fun film with no harm done. ***",8,4,7,17 November 2006
In Time," ' In a land where time is precious and valuable, one must guard each second '
","The writer/director of this film is Andrew Nicol and he has created a masterful work of art. I would not hesitate to predict, this film will become a S/F Classic. From the first few scenes of this movie until it's end, the audience is in for a wild unpredictable ride of it's life. The story involves life in a world where life has become the standard currency for all things worthy of being purchased. Thus if one wants to buy something, he or she can trade their time life for it. Thus Time becomes the coin of the realm. Thus, Time becomes money. What's further unusual is the cast for this incredible bit of entertainment. Already recognized as an established singer, Justin Timberlake now plays Will Salas with Amanda Seyfried playing his rich and mostly ambivalent girlfriend who's Romeo and Juliet relationship leaves their tire tracks all over the screen. There is intense drama and incredible excitement, enough to create memories which will certainly generate requests for a sequel or a TV series. All in all this is one movie which will garner much acclaim in the entertainment world. Easily recommended to all. ****",8,7,9,15 February 2013
Thor," ' In a land before the age of Man, there existed Asgard, the home of the Viking Gods '
","From the creative mind of Stan Lee who makes his usual Cameo appearance, there arises yet another of his comic book heroes, ' Thor ' the God of Thunder. In this segment, narrated by and starring Anthony Hopkins as Odin, we have the young God Thor ( Chris Hemsworth) learning that being fearless, strong and courageous is not all that is required of the next King of the mystical kingdom of Asgard. Instead he disobeys his father and institutes a new war with the Frost Giants. For this he is banished to Earth to learn some humility and restraint. There he meets Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard, who we last seen in 'Red October'), his wife and Jane Foster. (Natalie Portman) While Thor is gone, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) his half brother usurps the throne and hopes to make Thor's banishment permanent. The entire film, (except for some rather cheesy characters who accompany Thor) is directed (rather well by the way) by Kenneth Branagh, is one incredible and fantastic visit to the Land of Odin. The sets, Costumes and the confrontations with the Frost Giants is nothing short of spectacular and worthy of Stan Lee Himself. Well worth a visit to the Theater and easily recommended. ****",7,1,2,12 February 2012
It's a Wonderful Life," ' You called me a warped frustrated old man, well what are you, but a warped frustrated young man '
","The movie is called ' It's a wonderful life ' and stars one of Hollywood's favorites. Frank Capra chose James Steward to play George Bailey, a young idealistic young man who believes he is destined to travel the world and make a fortune. It's a great dream, but unfortunately will never happen. Instead, George is forced into an obscure existence, as he admires his father so much it dooms him to replace the old man in Bedford Falls.

","During the past centuries, the Santanic rituals of the Black mass have been updated so often, it has caused many a coven to rewrite their purpose. Servants of the Black arts are no longer bound by cannon law. Indeed, modern films depict followers with a definite role and their agenda empowers women to believe they are the foundation of man's ultimate fate. Case in point. ' Rosemary's Baby ' written by Ira Levin in 1967 was adapted for the screen in 1968. The story is of a young couple who move into a New York Apartment called 'the Bramford' a building with a haunting past.

War of the Worlds," Family Feud Meets the Martians
","The movie War of the Worlds, (2005) is a case study of a dysfunctional family under fire. Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise) plays a stevedore who returns home one day to greet his estranged wife, her new husband, his rebellious teenage son, a banshee-screaming daughter and invading Martians. Despite the explosive eruption, colossal growth, murderous rampage and vaporous populous, Ray reacts curiously as beings from Mars emerge to, destroy his city and systematically set out to conquer the world. Inhibiting clear thinking is his protective attitude, his chiding son who lambaste his father for personal failures, and his terrified daughter who's irritating screams prevent planning and implementation. The movie attempts to bring to life the classic novel by H. G. Wells and in many ways succeeds. However, Spielberg spent so much time on the bickering family, that he left the audience straining to see the cataclysmic confrontation between Earth's forces and the gigantic Tri-pod Martains, over the shoulders of Cruise and his problems. The original 1957 version had Gene Barry as a scientist and the audience easily followed him. In this version, Cruise is a common man who's innate curiosity becomes a hindrance. In addition, the great talent of Tim Robbins is wasted as a crazed survivor. In conclusion, the original had direction, the new version is hampered with family ties. Except for a few exceptional scenes, the film failed to live up to the original. ***",6,1,3,28 November 2005
12 Years a Slave," ' The Suffering inflicted on the body, is slight compared to the scars left on the Soul '
","From the deeply painful and agonizing pages of his own life's story, comes this gripping tale written first hand by author Solomon Northup and directed adroitly by Steven R. MCQueen. His memories reveal what took place 1n 1841. The place was Saratoga, New York and Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is making a living playing his violin and enjoying his life with his wife and family when he is tricked into believing he can earn more money if he will accept some temporary musical employment in upstate New York. The ruse results in his being abducted and sold into Slavery. Once in chains, he is drugged, manacled and whipped into submission, then thrown into a dark prison cell. Once in bondage, he decides to accept his fate until he can find some way to extricate from the chains of captivity. The movie itself is a frightening and terrifying expose on what Black Americans had to endure during their years of punishing captivity. For the audience, one has to refrain from displaying an immediate reaction to the torturous and barbaric scenes in the film. The cast which includes Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt (In a cameo Role) and the incredible script left me stunned watching the painful legacy of our own history. Mr. McQueen wore a tapestry of both sorrow and triumph with the autobiography penned by Solomon Northup himself. It's little wonder why the movie has garnered so many accolades, awards and prestigious honors across the country. A hardy 'Well-Done' is called for upon seeing this masterful work of art. Recommended to all those who wish to see a Classic in visual form. ****",10,5,9,5 March 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," ' All that effort and loss of life, madness, simply madness '
","When this film appeared, in 1957, it naturally garnered many an award and much personal acclaim for director David Lean. The story itself, originally written by none other than noted French writer Pierre Boulle, who wrote the book, Planet of the Apes, was pleased with the finished project. The story is very loosely based on the actual construction endeavor, called building the Kwai bridge, is herein incorporated to include the British prisoner of war camp, run by the Japanese during World War Two. A culturally traditional, hard-nose commandant, one Col. Saito (internationally acclaimed Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa) has been given the task of constructing a railroad bridge over the river Kwai and is further ordered to have it completed by a given date. Failure is not an option. To his camp arrives an equally stubborn and somewhat arrogant British officer, one Col. Nicholson, (Alec Guinness) with several hundred POW soldiers. Already in the camp is a small detachment of American and allied soldiers who have been assailed and threatened to build the bridge. Among them is, Commander Shears (William Holden) an American POW who manages to escape the hell hole and makes it safely to a British base. Though Saito and Nicholson begin a battle of wits as to who is in command of the camp and its men, Shears is confronted by another British officer, Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkings) who asks him to return to the site of the bridge, to help him blow it up! James Donald plays Maj. Clipton, a British medical officer who watches as the various conflicting officers strive to give logic to insane goals. Every audience who views this movie, has to decided for themselves who among the officers, makes any sense to a mad-cap project. The film should be a testament to the insanity of every war. ****",7,5,8,24 November 2008

Eventually, the controlled setting is disrupted by McMurphy's increasing antics, each drawing him into a direct confrontation with Ratched and the powers that be. The question remains? Who will end up controlling the place. The actors playing the inmate are incredible and memorable. Scatman Crothers, Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif, Mimi Sarkisian and Will Sampson. This is a true classic. ****",9,1,3,26 July 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," ' There is no prestige in being Poor '
","The greatness of a memorable film emerges from an exceptional Director like Martin Scorsese. This film entitled ' The Wolf of Wall Street ' was written by Jordon Belfort who's malicious deceptive practices eventually earn him a stint in Federal Prison. Taken from the excessive exploits of Jordon Belfort himself, it tells the story of a unemployed Wall Street executive who was abruptly lay-ed off but despite his fall, landed on his feet. Despite falling, he arose quickly to create a new financial institution which not only netted him millions, but created a whole new way to acquire further riches.

In addition, Belfort also seeks out and weds the love of his life Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) who brings romantic security and domestic headaches as well.The movie is fast paced, money, drug and sex oriented along with the life style of the rich and famous. DiCaprio is in his element in this movie as are the talented actors of Scorseses' cast, who showcase what can happen when unbridled greed meets unrestricted wealth. This film will rank as a Classic in time and will become a milestone for Scorsese and Decaprio. Recommended, but with definite warning to one and all. ****",9,3,6,29 March 2014
The Green Mile," ' I knows you think I's a powerful man, but the darkness scares me boss '
","The world is teeming with wretched prisons wherein all manner of men are housed. Because these men are said to have committed a crime, the places are manifest and most men serving there, have earned their stay. However, as history has shown, there are innocent men incarcerated as well. Occasionally, one of these innocents are not only imprisoned, but are further remembered because their life becomes legend. In this case, the realization is nothing short of incredible as the new prisoner is a natural empath. Steven King the prolific American horror writer, chronicles this unusual story in a Louisanna prison where one Joe Coffee, (Michael Clarke Duncan) a huge, nay, enormous Black man, having been convicted of murder, is sentenced to be executed, by electrocution. Tom Hanks( And Dabbs Greer) plays Paul Edgecomb, an aging Prison Guard, who recalls his years in the state prison. Working on 'Death Row' or ' The Green Mile ', Mr. Edgecomb recalls Mr. Coffee's arrival and the strange events during his stay. With sympathetic Guards, like Brutus Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), Harry Terwilliger (Jeffery Demunn and one particular sadistic guard called Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison), Edgecomb recollects his discovery of the man's unusual healing powers and the surprising revelations concerning his innocence. The story is crafted by Steven King and it's application to the silver screen is perhaps one of the finest adaptation ever done. Duncan is magnificent and has a superb ability to allow the audience to learn his true purpose. Were it not for the sadistic behavior of Hutchison, who earned his ultimate reward, the story would not have carried it's genuine sympathetic awe which gave this movie it's Classic status. A great film and a must for true movie fans. ****",9,15,19,29 October 2009

","Somewhere in the dark, amid the wet streets of Berlin, this story arose. It was originally written by Bernhard Schlink, screen played by David Hare and later directed in a motion picture by Stephen Daldry. The story is of a young teenage boy named Michael Berg (David Kross) who is smitten by Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) an older neighbor and seduced into an assignation. Though their affair is the basis for their initial contact, Michael comes to enjoy the pleasant company of the older woman who introduces him to youthful physical pleasure, but also to the mysterious side of a woman with a secret. It is this secret which the adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) must contend with. His older life revolves around their early companionship, one which ties them inexorably to the future. The forward and backward motion of the story is difficult to come to grips with, but eventually the audience snares the essence of message. Mr. Fiennes is superb as Michael and comes to realize there is so much hatred between the races, it could easily keep theme apart for eternity. The movie is incredible, the cast which includes Bruno Ganz as Professor Rohl, is superior and the result is a basis for a Classic and after viewing the film, would not be surprised. ****",8,1,1,26 June 2010
Jaws," ' You're Gonna Need a Bigger Boat '
","According to his own recollection, novelist Peter Benchley stated he considered his story involving a huge shark attacking beach swimmers several years before the movie. When the book came out, Steven Spielberg first thought it would make for a good scary movie. That was before he became aware of all the technical problems involved. At one point he hated the project and anything having to do with it. To his credit, he finished the difficult film and it became a true Classic in it's own right. The actual story is based on the 1916 account of New Jersey beach goers being attacked and devoured by a real life shark. It is no surprise, when you see the film 'Jaws' be prepared for some unexpected shock scenes. There are several which if you're seeing it in the dark room, at night or alone, you'll find yourself seeking company, comfort or a large weapon. To my way of thinking, it is the actors who imbue the film with such artistic reality, they cause audiences to re-consider going swimming in the ocean. Spielberg did an excellent job in finding Roy Scheider to play, land loving Police Chief Martin Brody. Robert Shaw is superb as Quint and his ' USS Indianapolis story' makes for mental horror. Youthful newcomer Richard Dreyfuss is excellent as Matt Hooper, the 'professional' shark expert. Murray Hamilton plays the fiscally stubborn Mayor Larry Vaughn. Together the cast add their personal signature to this incredible film and place it on the shelves of the finest movies ever made. ****",9,7,12,25 November 2008

","Dan Collins created this black Macabe thriller back in the 1960s and despite it being a bit of a shock to audiences, it nevertheless became a lasting entertainment staple for years.

Entomed for two hundred years, Barnabas is accidentally released and now plans to have his revenge on the witch who still lives. The movie is well made, the characters sincere and the dialog is apt for the cast which includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter, and Eva Green, Angelique Bouchard, Gulliver McGrath and not surprisingly the great and equally legendary actor Christopher Lee who recalls his Vampire in the 60s'. The masterful film is musically crafted by Danny Elfman who added his superior scores to such Classics as 'Nighmare before Christmas', with modern tunes such as 'Theme from a Summer place.' There is much in this film which will earn it's place with other notables, but rest assure it goes beyond that and surely will also become a Classic.

","On a Planet far away there appeared a young man who created a fantastic science fiction movie which ignited the imagination of millions and he entitled it STAR WARS. Viewing the original sparked the most fanciful dreams. The original was a classic, however as many expected, the sequels, and there have been a few, have all fallen short of the mark. The latest installment is Star Wars III, the Revenge of the Sith. The movie begins with a cavalcade of space craft engaged in deadly combat. A few scenes even forget that there is no air in outer space. Someone should tell the director. Once into the heart of the movie, the most obvious, in your face, aspect of this film are the guns, gadgets and college of characters. Missing prominently however is cohesion. It seems Mr. Lucus has taken his original idea board and created a puzzle. But viewing this latest segment, one get's the impression the pieces of his puzzle are being created as he goes along.

","Wars have always been an integral part of humanity's suicidal efforts to destroy itself. In The film, Lord of War, Nicolas Cage, plays Yuri Orlov, who's weapons, allow the process of death and mass murder to become an art form. The film is unapologetic and quite brutal as are the actors who portray the various waring dictators, soldiers and merchants of death participating in the gun-trade. Following his transformation from drug dealer to arms dealer, Yuri displays a genius for circumventing international law and becomes an expert at delivering death to any infant nation struggling for survival around the world. Chased by a persistent Federal agent from the U.S., as well as inter-pol agents, the film is set to the background of various conflicts around the globe. The film is a social statement which reminds us, there are many nations who'd rather prostitute their country's resources and the lives of their people, than establish a future for them.

","Anyone interested in learning the origins of the infamous C.I.A. this movie would be a good beginning. The film, by and large is a superficial, albeit, a glorified version of the creation of the nation's spy agency. Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) is a quiet, but introspective student at prestigious Yale University, when, due to him being white, male and confirmed breeding, is sought out for membership in the secretive, nefarious and primarily bigoted organization called 'Skull and Bones.

","Most Americans who never went to World War Two, received their information through wire services, radio and any outlet which brought the war home. Since films were plentiful, this movie took Prisoner of War life and brought it to the heartland of America. The film is called ' Stalag 17 ' and is the best representation of said life as envisioned by consummate director Billy Wilder. The story takes place in 1944, during the famous Battle of the Buldge. 600 American soldiers, Sargents all, share the minimal and miserable existence of Prisoners of War. One night, two prisoners try a planned night-time escape, but are quickly captured and murdered. Because they were so easily betrayed, the rest of the men in the barracks suspect a traitor lives among them. But who? Neville Brand, who plays 'Duke' quickly suspects the most cynical of their group, one J.J. Sefton. (William Holden). This is because, Sefton is at ease in the prison and creates suspicion when getting along with the enemy. He also is content to not be seen as a hero. When the two men are killed, his fellow prisoners suspect he will also betray the new arrival, one Lt.James Dunbar (Don Taylor) who is accused of destroying a German ammunition train. Otto Preminger plays Col. Von Scherbach, the German commandant of the camp. Robert Strauss who is Stanislas Kasava and Harvey Lembeck, as Harry Shapiro play the camp clowns and bring much humor into an otherwise dreary existence. Richard Erdman, Peter Graves and Sig Ruman who plays German Sgt. Johann Schulz complete the main cast.

Indeed, the cast members which include, Andreas Wisniewski, Dave Legeno, Ulrich Thomsen and especially Olga Kurylenko, give a auspicious performance. This is one of those movies which in time will be sought after as a great Classic. To that end I for one easily recommend it for the true Collector. ****",9,6,11,7 April 2013
Prometheus," ' You traveled across the Galaxy to live longer, only to die sooner '
","In ancient times, it was believed one of the Titans journeyed down from Olympus and gave Mankind the gift of fire. Now Jon Spaihts, Damon Lindelof and director Ridley Scott have teamed up to bring us this nightmarish movie called ' Prometheus. ' The story is that of an aging rich and powerful C.E.O. of the Weyland Corporation who provides the funds for an deep space intergalactic spacecraft called the U.S.S. Prometheus, it's mission? to seek out the origins of mankind, based on ancient languages and cave drawings. Because it takes years to traverse the length of space, the team sleeps through the entire trip. The only member of the crew who does not hibernate is an android named David. (Michael Fassbender) He awakens the Captain (Idris Elba) and the mission crew including Charlie Holloway, (Logan Marshall-Green), (Noomi Rapace) Elizabeth Shaw, Charlize Theron and Peter Weyland (Guy Pearce). Upon landing, they set out to explore the waiting planet not realizing it contains a dark and sinister secret. The film's landscape is intersperse with vast empty areas pockmarked with mountains, ominous caves and gigantic monoliths which resembles those of Earths' past. Although what is sought is the secret to immortality, what is actually found is enough to keep many of the audience members from sleeping alone in a dark room. Suffice to say it's interesting to see Guy Pearce as an aging billionaire, but more so to see Mr.Ridley Scott returning to his roots. ****",8,3,7,6 June 2012
Paths of Glory," ' Man can always measure his madness, with each successive war '
","Every war bears its own signature. As with all wars, none ever succeeds in proving it's original intention. Take the First World War for instance. It's was touted as the War to End all Wars. That never happened. Instead, it is agreed, it firmly established the reasons for the Second World War. This film is entitled ' The Paths of War ' and like all wars there is much insanity in it's story. During the many battles, there were orders and counter-orders, some of which made no sense at all. In this movie, one such order concerned the careers of several high ranking French Officers, such as Gen. George Broulard and Gen. Paul Mireau (Adolphe Menjou and George Macready) who were only interested in making a name for themselves. Thus when they concocted a suicidal attack on a German position called 'The Ant hill' they were fully aware that such an assault would needlessly cost the lives of hundreds of French soldiers. Being veterans of many such reckless and futile assaults, many in the infantry refused to go. The furious Generals thereafter selected several soldiers to be arrested and tried for Cowardice and executed. Despite the most persuasive and certainly the most logical defense offered by Col. Dax, their lawyer (Kirk Douglas), the cowardly generals refused to change their order. The entire saga of this true story is forever affixed in the annals of French stupidity. Moreover, the insanity of the French Officer corps, is a prime example of all Militaries throughout the world. Indeed, movies like this and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' are excellent reasons for abolishing war altogether. However, like the outcome in this film, it is ordained by the arrogant ignorance of each new generation. We can only pray, it's won't be as repetitive as our propensity for destruction. ****",9,1,2,19 May 2009
Saints and Soldiers," ' Amid the ghosts of the Second World War, Snow Angels '
","They say after every massacre, there are always survivors. That is certainly true for this film which relates the story of four American soldiers who escaped the unwarranted and despicable atrocity, later called 'The Malmedy Massacre'. The movie is entitled ' Saints and Soldiers ' and is the saga of the men who, having survived the massacre, must now journey back to their own lines. In the middle of a winter storm, the tiny group must do so without food or supplies through enemy infested woods, all the while trying to stay alive. Though they escape, their ordeal is further hampered by suspicion, fear, freezing conditions and the discovery of a downed British airman. The officer has vital information which must reach communication lines to safeguard the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers. Amid the ivory snow-laden landscape, two soldiers, Cpl. Nathan 'Deacon' Greer (Corbin Allred) and Medic Steven Gould ((Alexander Niver) clash over personal ideologies, trying hard to fathom each others steadfast beliefs. Military situations change on both sides allowing the men to exchange trusts, doubts and suspicions. The result? A quite and sobering conclusion creating troubling emotions for both men and an equally poignant ending to the story. A good film and one which allows the audience to acquire ample food for thought. ****",7,4,8,2 March 2009
Ben-Hur," ' We keep you alive to serve this ship. so row well and live '
","The film Ben Hur is set in the time of Christ, circa 33 BC. This is the story of two boys, one Roman, one Jewish. It seems from the time the two were children, they were close enough to be brothers. So close in fact an observer might even infer, a closeness of another kind. Still, the story is reminiscence of their childhood when the two boys meet after an absence of some ten years. One portion of the film purports to remind the audience of the heroic actions of the Roman Boy (Stephen Boyd) as Messala and how after a decade, expects that by saving his friend's life, the Jewish boy will feel the importance of honor and friendship for the new position of responsibility of the Roman Tribune. Instead, the Jewish boy (Charlton Heston) as Judah Ben-Hur, who also has grown up, feels the weight of the empire and hopes his friend is there to loosen the Roman grip on the land of Judea. This meeting, begins friendly enough, but soon explodes into bitterness and feeling of betrayal. The Roman boy, feeling Judah owes him his life and loyalty, is rebuffed, by the sense of patriotism felt by the newly acquired faith of the people of Judea. What follows then is a series of tragedies. Judah chooses his self-importance and his people over his friend and allows disaster to place him at his friend's mercy. Having chosen faith instead of friendship, Messala allows his former friend to suffer the punishment of his own folly. Judah cannot understand his friend and sets out on the long road of revenge, killing three men in the process and eventually doing the same to his friend. In all, it's Judah who betrays the man who gave him life and allows him to die in the arena. The story of revenge is complete. Lesson learned. Save your friend and you may live to regret it. The film is spectacular in both breath and scope. Having garnered eleven awards, little more needs to be said. ****",8,2,5,10 October 2005
Casino Royale," The Immortal Mr. Bond
","Any fan of Ian Flemming who takes a liking to the immortal Mr. Bond, will certainly like the latest film called Casino Royale. From the beginning to end, this film will not disappoint fans of OO7. I was most impressed with the new actor who plays James Bond who in this film is portrayed by Daniel Craig {is it me, or does he resemble a mature Steve McQueen?}. Although, appearing ever-ready to hang up his Berretta, Craig leaves nothing to be desired in the agent's persona with an immortal legacy. In this story, Bond is up against a most sinister and certainly worthy adversary called Le Chiffre, who's aim is to provide an almost limitless bank account with which to supply international terrorism worldwide. In order to establish the world account, he must defeat Bond in among other challenges a multi-million dollar high stakes poker game. To be sure, Bond is ever accompanied by C.I.A. agent Felix Leiter (Jeffery Write) and of course ' M ' (Judi Dench). Anyone fearing that Bond has lost his physical ability to confront the modern heavy, will be disappointed as Bond adequately displays an abundance of action, drama, and of course his suave debonair self with the leading lady. All in all, a marvelous vehicle to continue the legacy of the most popular Secret Agent of them all. ****",8,4,9,18 March 2007
Beowulf," ' Nordic Sages which told of Men of Iron and Fire Breathing Dragons '
","From the far off lands of Ice and snow comes the fiery tale of a dark land, courageous men, sultry beautiful women and fierce monsters which assailed their cold barren world. This early fable arises in the 6th century A.D. and related a historical Saga of a time when a mythical monster called Grendal, terrorized the Land of The Vikings. Each night when the Danes would decide to celebrate with drinking, dancing, loud songs and boisterous merriment, a gigantic lake dwelling creature named Grendal would invade their Mead-Hall and began killing the men inside. The murderous spree would nightly reoccur until all the men were dead. A ghastly event which continued until the exasperated King finally offered his kingdom to any man who would kill the monster. This movie is called ' Beowulf ' and is based on that particular Nordic Saga. Ray Winstone plays Beowulf and is convincingly believable as the Icelandic hero. The film is a wondrous, action-pack movie and sure to entertain all who see it.. For those seeking excitement in a fantastic, dramatic and dark film, you've found it. It's got all the elements of a black legendary story complete with a fire-breathing dragon. This and a fine cast which includes Sir Anthony Hopkins. You can do no better. ****",9,2,3,29 January 2013

","From the superb minds of Don Payne, Stan Lee and director Alan Taylor comes this next chapter in the life of the Mythical Norse God, Thor (Chris Hemsworth). We learn that Odin, (Anthony Hopkins) the King of the Viking Gods has discovered the Dark Elves have once again retrieved their Ancient power called the Aether and the Elves believed it's time to destroy Asgard with it.

The Sixth Sense," I See Dead People
","It isn't often a new director rises so quickly to the top of the 'A' list with only a handful of films. But M. Night Shyamalan does exactly that with the surprise hit, The Sixth Sense. The tale is of a popular, but egotistic doctor (Bruce Willis) who sincerely believes in his award winning psychotherapeutic abilities and looks forward to a prosperous career with the mentally ill. But failing to secure a proper treatment for a suicidal patient, the doctor finds himself with yet another troubled, but far more mysterious boy (Halley Joel Osment) who possesses the power to communicate with the afterlife. Together they discover their own fears and a need for mutual understanding and trust. The film is a frightful combination of sights, sounds and illusionary symbols which creates terror and suspense with each new scene. The Director, like other famous movie artists, makes a cameo appearance and it up to the viewer to locate him during the unfolding drama. Fancible enough to be hauntingly interesting, the film is also a masterful canvas of photographic magic. Audiences everywhere will agree, this film will become a classic for the director and it's stars. ****",9,2,3,20 October 2006
The Producers," 'Hitler was a great painter! He could paint an entire apartment in one day, . . Two Coats! '
","Mel brooks' first attempt at directing is this film ' The Producers, ' originally entitled 'Spring Time For Hitler.' It's the story of down and out producer Max Bialystock (Zero Mostel), once known as the 'King of Broadway' who can't believe his incredible streak of bad luck. Once when the Moon of his Fortune rode high, he had Six shows running at once. However now-a-days he's so poor, he wears a Cardboard belt. Into his life arrives a timid little man named Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder). As an accountant, he makes a startling discovery. In his last play Max, raised more money to produce his show than he needed. As a result, Leo speculates Max could make more money with a flop, than with a hit. Max demands to know how and a crooked scheme develops. Max decides to find the worse play ever written. He will then hire the worse, director, the worse actors and then raise a $1,000.000 for a flop of a play which is sure to close the first night, allowing Max to keep all the rest of the money. This then is the plot and with Bloom becoming his partner, the pair plans on keeping the fortune. The movie which also casts Dick Shawn as 'L.S.D.' or Lorenzo St. DuBois, Kenneth Mars as Franz Liebkind, Christopher Hewett and Roger De Bris all combine to create a wonderful masterpiece of hysterical madcap comedy. It is with little wonder this film began as an unwanted idea and ended up becoming the surprise hit of the decade.

RED," ' I'm Retired, not stupid '
","During the Cold War, the two sides of the world did their level best to outguess the other, often times, they caused more confusion than not. From the hundreds of people who fought on either sides there were many who were often sacrificed for the good of the cause, only to discover that what they did, was unnecessary. Having wasted millions of dollars in a vain attempt to win for their flawed ideology, there was also the Human cost of the mindless and most assuredly useless endeavor. Therein lies the basis for this film written by Jon and Ereic Hoeber and directed by Robert Schwentke. It tells the story of a group of aging Secred Agents who find themselves retired. Case in point is that of retired Former agent Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) who one day discovers, someone is trying to kill him. He escapes assignation and flees from the gunmen.

Flight," ' One can lie to anyone, but never to one's own conscience '
","Emerging from the fertile mind of noted writer John Gatins, comes this enlightening introspective study of ability, courage, arrogance and reckless denial. The main actor for this dramatic high flying film is non-other than Denzel Washington. He portrays Whip Whitaker, an experience, but flawed commercial pilot with hundreds of hours of flight time and who's expertise has been adequately proved with past military deeds. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, this movie lays the foundation for what should be a role worthy of an Academy Award. The story follows Whitaker through a scheduled routine flight to Atlanta. Encountering a sever storm, the plane suddenly becomes the center-piece in every pilot's worse nightmare. The plane finds itself tossed about in the sky and despite the incredible efforts of it's crew, the planes plummets into the ground with loss of life and injury. It also initiates a Media frenzy, a Federal Board of Inquiry and a gigantic personal problem for Withaker. With his best friends running interference for him (Bruce Greenwood (Supurb acting) and Don Cheadle (Superior role)), provide a life and career saving out for him. What then follows is the making of a Classic movie for the entire cast. Indeed, John Goodman who plays Harling Mays is a scene stealer and he too should earn a Best Supporting actor award. All in all, this is one film that will become a Milestone for Washington and a recommended movie for anyone looking for an extraordinary movie for our time. ****",9,2,4,9 February 2013

","There are a number of super talented actor/directors in Hollywood. One of the most prolific is James Wong. In this film which he not only wrote, but directed as well he displays what many would consider his best work to date. This is the story of Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) who accompanies his high school friends on a field trip to France.

","Rian Johnson is fast becoming a mainstream writer/director and his movies are proving that. This film called ' Looper ' is also written by him. Indeed with Bruce Willis staring in this futuristic movie it's sure to become a favorite of many. The story may be difficult to follow, but then Time travel is difficult to understand.

Heat," There Is A Flip Side To That
","Throughout ones cinematic life, a fan comes to understand the essential ingredients of every movie. When it comes to crime dramas, it becomes standard for the good guys to win over the bad guys. However, after a lifetime of watching the same scenarios, and knowing full well the good guys don't always win in real life, sophisticate audiences then expect reality to be part of the movie. Few authority figures want to change the 'good always triumphs' myth, but modern audiences demand more 'authentic' crime dramas and thus a few courageous directors will give the audience what it demands. The best among them is Michael Mann. The movie 'HEAT' has earned him more acclaim than any movie to date for realistic films. Anyone who views Heat, will see real life drama in action. Watching the film one realizes more than Mann's superior direction went into the creation of this unique story. The sheer star power added to the magical combination. Here we have Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) a veteran no nonsense detective who goes after only the best crime 'Crews' and will not stop until they are put down. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a master career criminal who rarely makes mistakes in his craft. Val Kilmer plays Chris Shiherlis a professional who is willing to put everything on the line for his woman and the Big Score. Jon Voight is superb as De Niro's mysterious fence and skilled consultant. The Big heist is upon them and De Niro's hand picked crew is going for 70 million. Al Pacino's special elite police squad will be there to try and stop them and to bring their crime spree to a end. Expect Micahel Mann to allow the experienced criminals to take on the well armed police with military weapons and precision teamwork in one of the bloodiest, explosive most exciting running gun battles ever created. This movie is a must for anyone who's tired of the bad guys losing all the time. *****",10,4,8,10 June 2007
Hart's War," ' If you want equality, think how they'd be treated back Home '
","Amid the heavy snows of the winter of 1944, near the Ardennes forests of what would later be called the 'Malmedy Massacre' lay the quiet, frozen bodies of 150 dead American soldiers murdered by the Sixth SS Panzer Army. Other Americans who survived were captured by Wehrmacht forces and sent to one of a dozen German P.O.W. camps. It was in one of these camps that Lt. Thomas Hart (Colin Farrell) and others are sent for internment. Here amid the growing number of captured Prisoners, he is introduced to Col. William McNamara (Bruce Willis) a serious, disheartened West Point officer who believes every leader must prove himself worthy of command. Settling in a non-com barracks, Lt. Hart meets Staff Sgt. Victor Bedford (Cole Hauser) a 'scrounger' and man of surprising resources. Aside from his talent, he is a myopic, hate filled bigot who angrily protests the inclusion of two captured black pilots sent to their unit. When one pilot is shot for allegedly trying to escape, Bedford is accused of betraying him and is subsequently murdered. The blame immediately falls on Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Howard) who is charged and given a General Courtmartial. With his life in the balance, Col. McNamara assigns Lt. Hart to defend him. With little experience Hart begins to construct a defense when he learns of the restrictions place in his way by his commanding officer. However, Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures), the German officer commanding the P.O.W. camp seeks an opportunity to prove his superiority over McNamara, decides to help Hart. What the ulterior motives of both Commanders are becomes Hart's objectives as he realizes there is more at stake than a single man's innocence. The dark drama of this movie is filled with tension, anger and shadowy perceptions. I believe this film will be seen in the future as one of Willis' all time Classics and a silent tribute to the spirits which linger in the Ardennes Forests. ****",8,2,4,21 February 2010
Thirteen Days," ' I can wait till hell freezes over for your answer'
","In the 1960's few realized how close the world came to Nuclear Winter. Even today, with all the resources at hand, fewer care who prevented the Third World War. One thing is certain, America was enormously fortunate to have had as President of the United States, John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) during those nearly fatal '13 Days.' As the thinking man's president, Mr. Kennedy was lucky to have in his cabinet men of intellect and reason. His main confident was his younger brother, Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp) who proved invaluable as Attorney General. When the world learned of the Nuclear threat ninety miles away, Kennedy came to rely heavily on his political adviser Kenny O'Donald (Kevin Costner) who displayed cautious insight and prudent judgment in critical moments which could have proved disastrous had the Joint Chiefs of Staff gotten their way. Further, Kennedy was definitely fortunate to have selected as his ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman) who stood toe to toe with Russian's Valerian Zorin (Oleg Vidov) and did not back down. The film is dramatic and terrifyingly accurate with dated Black and White footage and actual verbal scripts from hidden recordings from the oval office. What we know today is; had the Administration followed the prodding of the military, they would have initiated the Third World War as the Russian military in Cuba, actually had short range Atomic warheads at their disposal. This is a frightening film for rational people. ****",9,22,28,19 July 2007
300," ' The Irresistible force . . . . . against the Immovable object '
","The story of the three hundred Spartans is not the oldest legend originating from Greece, but it is the most famous. Although, Hollywood already had one version in 1962, it's but a shadow of, ' 300 '. Seeing the original and then watching this update, viewers will immediately see the difference. The first is candy coated and offered to entertain audiences holding a box of popcorn. This movie with it's spectacular visual panorama, violent action scenes and overall dramatic effects, will cause you to hold your breath. Gerard Butler, is impressive as King Leonidas. Dominic West as Theron and Vincent Regan as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro is Xerxes, in modern gang attire and jewelry. This film may have originated in comic pages, but it explodes on the silver screen as iconic art. This version is sure to inspire some to visit the site of the heroic last stand, but may also inspire others to delve into the history books. On that note, there are minor historical mistakes, such as the Spartan king demeaning the Atheans as boy-lovers (which law allowed) but in fact, it was Spartan culture which habitually practice pederasty. Another literary goof, was the use of War-rhinos, elephants and mutants. One in particular which bothered me was the Greek traitor 'Ephialtes' as having been deformed. No historical reference to that. The idea of single Spartan fathers training their sons individually goes against traditional schooling in military academies. One last criticism. The Spartans claimed they fought for freedom and stated the Persian king was a tyrant. Any history book on Sparta, will illuminate the fact, Sparta used Helots as Slaves. Nevertheless, if you don't mind, these and a few other inaccuracies, the film will astonish you with its movie magic and I predict, will imprint itself as a Classic. *****",9,6,11,30 July 2007

","It is 1970 and the U. S. is used to the fact, America's space program is brilliantly successful and it's space trips to the Moon have become routine. However, just when the U.S. becomes complacent about it's achievements, disaster strikes. According to the book written by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger, a faulty circuit built into the wiring aboard their space vehicle two years before their scheduled trip, a problem was waiting to endanger their mission. Ron Howard the gifted actor/director creates a real-life historical drama with this film called ' Apollo 13. ' Nearly a quarter of a million miles into space, the astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks) Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) and rookie Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) experience a major explosion aboard this space craft and within minutes realize they may not only not reach the moon, but are in danger of dying before they get there. Their only hope is that the ground team at the Huston Space center can somehow discover a way to help them get home. Despite the fact there are several special teams who help the astronauts' convert their landing craft to become a life-line, none of it would have mattered had it not been for Astronaut Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise). His expertise and computer knowledge is incredible and one applause's his tireless efforts. The film itself is a tribute to the courage and fortitude of the families and their daunting task of trying not to show their fear in front of a plethora of newsmen, media correspondences and T.V. reporters who lay siege to their homes. The movie is exciting and sympathetically poignant as the audience joins the three men in a life and death struggle. This movie is a triumph not only for the actors, the director, but also for the space program which endures to this day as America's finest. ****",9,1,1,3 March 2011
The Great Escape," Escape and the Cooler King
","Back in 1963, a war film arrived on the silver screen which set the standard for all dramas which followed. True there were other great war films such as The War Lover and Twelve O'Clock High, but none of them became the launching point for so many of Hollywood's great screen stars. Paul Brickhill wrote the original true story upon which this film is based on. Furthermore, with Elmer Berstein's rousing musical score, this movie then becomes nothing short of genuine classic. The saga of 'The Great Escape' is wound around the actual war time experiences of American and British Airmen, who'd been captured and sent to what the German High Command called 'An Escape proof' prisoner of War Camp. Upon seeing the assortment of Hollywood elite, one can not expect anything but great drama and action adventure from the entire cast. Steve McQueen, who plays Capt.

","From the fertile, creative mind of fiction writer Frank Miller, arrives this powerful new comic-book turned movie entitled Sin City. The film itself contains the rare but measured ingredients of a true classic comic.

Windtalkers," ' It's a Navajo prayer which allows the Spirit to be able to recognize its body'
","During World War two, dozens of minorities in the US fought on the side of the American Armed Forces. Spanish Americans received their baptism of fire during the 'Battan Death March.' Japanese Americans, despite having their Constitional rights trampled, did their share mostly on the Italian mainland. But it is this film, 'The Wind Talkers' that Native Americans, specifically Navajos, from the Southwest, had their proudest moments immortalized on film. It is true Native Navajos became famous for their unique language or Unbreakable Code which became indispensable for Military communications during the Battle for Siapan and other islands. Unfortunately it took 60 years for them to be recognized. John Woo's movie is incredibly prolific in its vicious rendering of the savage island battle. History records the Japanese lost 30,000 soldiers defending, while American losses were approximately 3,000. The brutal drama selects Nicolas Cage as Sergeant Joe Enders, an experienced Marine who wants to avenge his dead comrades, by feigning full recovery from his wounds and volunteering for combat. His secret orders are, 'to protect and if necessary, Prevent his Code-talker from ever falling into enemy hands. Adam Beach plays Private Ben Yahzee, who believes he is only doing his military duty by being a Code-Talker. Roger Willie plays Private Charlie Whitehorse a second Navajo who proves his courage under the most extreme battle conditions. Peter Stormare is convincing as Gunnery Sergeant Hjelmstad and Christian Slater plays Sgt. Pete Anderson, a Marine with second thoughts on caring out his secret duty. Jason Isaacs has a bit part as Major Mellitz, who emphasizes to his men the importance of following orders. The direction of the film is complementary to the story and is worthwhile for any action movie fan to sit riveted to his chair as the war-time slaughter explodes across the fiery screen. For we who are reminded of the sacrifices of our Veterans and wartime servicemen, this movie is a fitting tribute indeed. The finished product? A military Classic in the making. ****",9,1,2,30 November 2008

","In the late 13th Century, a modern descendant of Sir William Wallace, one Randall Wallace, set to pen this long forgotten epic. The story as told by modern writers, began when Wallace takes up the challenge of the English invaders on their own terms. This fine film called 'Brave heart ' is an excellent rendition of the basic facts of the legacy. Although there are many disputed events, the final outcome was nothing short of complete freedom from English tyranny. Mel Gibson plays the Scottish hero William Wallace and does a commanding effort and furthermore he directs the dramatic epic as well. In his superb cast are Hollywood veterans like Brian Cox, Patrick McGoohan, Angus Macfadyen as Robert the Bruce and Alun Armstrong. The lasting impression one gets from this movie are the vicious, slaughter-house re-enactments of the most brutal battle scenes in Scottish history. Although it's the cast and crew which combine to bring History to life, it is the poignant interwoven romantic inter-story which adds a novel flavor to it. All in all this is one exciting movie which has set in motion the wheels which will eventually turn it into a Historic Classic. ****",9,3,10,20 March 2011
Moon," ' There is an emptiness in all of us, it's evil is always lurking '
","I believe it was Rod Serling who often reminded audiences, the greatest terror we humans could ever face was isolation. Removed from our own kind, a man can easily succumb to it's terrifying power and in the end, go mad. In this 2009 film, writer/director, Duncan Jones, takes a page from Serling and relates the story of Sam Bell, (Sam Rockwell) an astronaut and mining engineer who has been contracted to live on the moon for three years. While there, working for Lunar Industries, he is to keep vigil on several moon excavators which automatically mine a substance call Helium 3 which is then 'harvested' and sent back to earth. Assisted by a robotic system named G.E.R.T.Y. (Kevin Spacy) Bell has done well to stay sane in this cold, dark, bleak lunar isolation. As time draws near for his contract to expire, he looks forward to returning to Earth and his wife and child. However, things which have gone well up till then, suddenly causes Bell to question his surroundings. Accidents, began to happen, dialog between himself and GERTY become confusing, he begins hallucinating and questioning himself and his CLONE. Although, the film itself is prone to some confusion, Rockwell does an exceptional job of keeping the audience focus towards a surprising ending. A memorable film and one which which sure to remind us of the Twilight Zone. ****",8,2,8,25 February 2011

Gladiator," ' When Death stares at you and smiles, all you can do is smile back'
","If one is ever asked to select a film which truly measures up to action, drama and historically accuracy, ' Gladiator ' is the first on that list. Movie audiences have long awaited a film which mixes history and action in such a way that it becomes memorable. Ridley Scott has become a true artist in his conception of action films. To date, few films have become so notable as this rendition of the last years of the Emperorer Marcus Aurelius( Richard Harris) on the Rhine. In this story we have a veteran Roman General (Russell Crowe) Maximus Meridius who having won yet another victory over the Germanic tribes, wishes nothing more than to go home and tend his crops. he asks his emperor for permission to go home, but before the wish is granted, he dies and his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes the new ruler. Fearing the popular general is a threat to him, he orders him killed. Oliver Reed (In his last film) plays Proximo, an owner of slaves and gladiators saves him and offers him a chance for revenge. Derek Jacobi plays Gracchus who lends a splendid dignity to the film. Spencer Treat Clark is Lucius who finds the Spanish Gladiator admirable, courageous and interesting. Throughout the movies, one cannot but enjoy the settings, the costumes and the various sub-topics which make for drama at it's best. Highly recommended, this film is sure to become a Classic. ****",9,4,5,8 October 2008
Contact," ' You must think like a Vegan, which means, functioning on Multiple Levels '
","Among the most notable men of Science in our century, Carl Segan must surely earned his place as one of the greatest. It would have been a great privilege, Indeed, an honor, to have met him. Sadly, those who did not take advantage of his presence, lost more than an opportunity. It comes as no surprise then, when having the chance to read his book, ' Contact ' or at least seeing the movie, many more did not. What a loss. The movie is to say the least awesome and inspirational as it translates the thoughts of Mr. Sagan himself. The story is of a young girl named Eli Arroway, the pride and joy of her scientist father Dr. Ted Arroway, played sympathetically by David Morse. She grows up to be present when Earth receives it's first interstellar message from outer space. She would have been out-of-luck and dealt quickly out of the game 'of the millennium ' had it not been for her benefactor, powerful S.R.Hadden. (John Hurt) Innicially, selected to be the first Representative from Earth to go on an incredible journey across Time and Space, to another Galaxy, she is abruptly and rudely replaced by her boss, David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) who goes first. (Literally) James Woods plays the tiresome Government heavy Michael Kitz who seems to be everywhere as chief of paranoia. Regardless of what positive good Arroway expects, Kitz suspects only the worse. The Galatic expanse the audience views while on board the space craft, is enough to bring out the poet in anyone with imagination. The film is nothing short of fantastic, darkly interesting and educational as Sagan would have wanted it. I believe when man lands on Mars, one of the first cities we establish there will be named after him. Great film and a future Classic. ****",8,2,5,15 July 2009

Cinderella Man," Dreams and the Common Man
","There is very little that a determined individual cannot do. Cinderella Man is a case in point. Thought of as an 'over-the-hill' boxer, the fanciful story of James Braddock (adroitly played by Russell Crowe) is a movie which should be seen by anyone who needs a second chance in life. Director Ron Howard has revealed once again that his talent for encouraging actors to perform at their peak is still evident. The film itself is occasionally enhanced by tragic emotional segments which tends to argument the action sequences, but not so much as to diminish the overall structure of the movie. All in all, Crowe and his co-stars, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti and Craig Bierko offer a remarkable segment out of the famous boxer's life and creates a landmark of excitement and entertainment destine to please audiences for generations to come. A fun and compassionate film for those with heart. ***",8,2,2,5 April 2006

Valkyrie," ' You would think, after fourteen tries, one would succeed '
","The history of the Second World War in any Encyclopdia ends with the Death of Adolf Hitler. In the movies, the man who created the Holocaust and so much misery in the world is always seen to have gotten away from justice. He boosted he would create a world Reich which would last a thousand years. Truth is, it lasted barely twelve. In the cinema, his shroud of death pervades countless war movies, concentration camps and an endless litany of German attempts at world dominations. In this film called ' Valkyrie ' audiences witness the fifteenth attempted on the leader of the Nazi party. Based on a true event which illustrated the difficulties of killing a man who seemed to be protected by a malevolent providence. The story centers on a courageous individual named Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) who believes the only way to save Germany is to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Armed with determination of purpose, he is selected by both politician and German officers alike to help save what's left of Germany. The entire episode details the attempt and the many obstacles he had to overcome. The drama is high class as is the acting from supporting cast like Eddie Izzard, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp, Tom Wilkinson and David Bamber as Adolf Hitler. Although not marking the actual footsteps of the real attempt, it does give a surreal appearance which places the audience directly in that terrible time and place. A wonderful film as it likewise gives tribute to the men and women who sacrificed their lives for their country. ****",8,1,1,6 June 2010
All the President's Men," ' There is no greater weapon in a democracy, than a free press '
","On June 17th, 1972 a security guard (Frank Willis) discovered a small piece of tape covering the latch on the basement door of the Headquarters of the National Democratic Committee in Florida. Calling for the police, they quickly arrested five well dressed burglars, one with $800 in his wallet. What few people knew was that these individuals would become the foundation of a massive conspiracy which involved the entire Federal community including the F.B.I, C.I.A. and other agencies working for the President of the United States. Attending the burglars at their court arraignment, rookie reporter Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) is astounded to learn one of the burglar's previously worked for the C.I.A. in the White House.

Law Abiding Citizen," ' Playing Chess with the criminal mind is nothing short of lunacy '
","The last we heard from Gerald Butler, the extra-ordinary actor was holding the pass of Thermopylae in ancient Greece against the Persians. Now, he has fast forwarded to playing Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) an innovative inventive genius and a ' Law Abiding Citzen ' in typical American fashion. One day at home he, his wife and child are savagely attacked in their home by two brutal killers. Unlike his wife and child, he survives and attends the murderers' day in court. Expecting both assailants to be convicted and executed, he learns, the ambitious District Attorney Nick Rice, (Jamie Foxx) has made a deal with one of the killers. Vowing revenge, Shelton, a bitter but brilliant and resourceful individual sets a clever trap for the killer who was release and punishes him. Everyone in the District Attorney's office is reflective of their original failure, except Rice. Realizing who the culprit is, Rice now challenges Shelton to a supreme cat and mouse game to see which one will prove the superior strategist. Throughout the entire film, Shelton proves it's he and stays well ahead of the D.A. Failing to beat his adversary within the law, Rice becomes as aggressively despairing in order to win, a notion, Shelton concedes. The movie is an exciting and violent film and one wonders if the adage is indeed true. In order to beat an enemy, one must become as vicious and destructive as he is. A remarkable and undeniable truism if ever there was one. This is a milestone film for Butler and predictably will become a Classic for him. ****",9,1,5,2 April 2010
Up in the Air," ' 'He knows the secret of life, is being alone, but never being lonely '
","In America, with corporations losing their ability to believe in tomorrow, they have discovered, that it is much easier to discharge employees, then to keep them. In this movie called ' Up in the Air ' we have Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) a corporate executive who's job it is to fire people whom their employer has decided they don't need. Ryan has become so skilled, he has lost most of his ability to sympathize with the people he puts on the unemployment line. His position is nearly tenured, until he meets up with Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who convinces the top executive, that she has discovered a more efficient and impersonal way of doing it. However, she lacks the necessary ambivalent, detachment and is therefore in need of further training which thereafter become Ryan's role. The movie, written and directed by Jason Reitman,is a cross section of America's economic woes and Clooney is superb as a high flying loner who has convinced himself that a man with no friends, attachments, home or responsibilities is much better off, That is until he meet Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga) a nearly mirror image of himself. With a whole litany of employees being canned, a few do stand out like J.K. Simmons (From Spiderman) who plays Bob and Sam Elliot who plays the Chief Airline Pilot. The film is a great vehicle for Clooney and one wonders how effortless he made this character his. An interesting, but fun offering. Recommended. ****",8,1,3,28 November 2010
V for Vendetta," The Revenge of an Idea
","It is not often the facade of a character can emerge from disaster to become a hero. However, there are precedents, like Phantom of the Opera, Darkman and The Hulk. They however, lack subtly. beauty, poetry or as the highbrows call it, Panache. Seeking to find an intellectual or sophisticated hero, I give you ' V .' It is not the usual movie. Indeed, it is quite a bit more. In fact I would go so far as to proclaim it is the best film of this genera, I have seen in years. There are many special qualities of a classic film and this one has them all. There is violence, suspense, drama, revenge, romance, comedy, intrigue, excitement and of course, mystery of character. Most of all, this film has Chancellor Adam Sutlet (John Hurt) who embodies the unbridled and ruthless power of a brutal government. Arrayed against him is V, superbly and adroitly played by extremely talented Hugo Weaving. The story is that of a dark hero who is condemned to unspeakable torture and imprisonment returns from certain dead to strike terror into the heart of an established totalitarian system which created him. Using the facade of a dead anarchist, Wearing plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with the police and the dictator, using both special effects and a dazzling dexterity with knives. His aim, to allow society to awaken from apathy and reclaim it's government. A must film for any modern citizen who remains reluctant to find fault with it's present malevolent government. ****",9,10,19,16 August 2006

","The Film is called ' O Brother, Where are Thou ? ' is directed by Joel Coen and having been written by his brother Ethan Coen. The story is a Hy-bred cross between a Depression era saga and Homor's ancient epic 'The Odyssey.' Three convicts escape a Chain gang and set off on a journey of discovery during the 1930s'. Though a bit confusing, the Characters more than explain their philosophies and their thoughts on life, each concluding that their suffering and predicaments are part of the natural order of things. Indeed, the stars of the movie more than anything else, give life to the escaping prisoners. George Clooney plays Everett McGill, an educated con-man with family troubles. John Turturro is Pete Hogwallop and Tim Blake Nelson are his two inmate followers who share his trek across the countryside. John Goodman, Michael Badalucco (As Baby-face Nelson) and Charles Durning join the cast and are credited with the spark of Good Ole southern Boys found throughout the story. Escaping from their captivity, the boys search for a buried treasure and are warned by a blind man that what they'll find is not what they hope for. In the meanwhile during the country election they find that their musical talents promise more than they know. What is a complete surprise in this film is the singing talent of George Clooney. Sophisticate in many other movies, in this one he delights audiences with his true down-home demeanor. All in all a real home-spun movie which will delight audiences everywhere. Well Done. ****",7,1,2,29 March 2013
The Godfather," ' I'll warn you only once, don't ever go up against the family '
","The era of the gangster arrived with the foundation of a strong individual who wanted to make all organized gangs subservient to a single power. Although the idea was not totally unique as some historians have accredited it to 'Legs Diamond, 'Dutch Shultzs or it might have originated with Mr. Maranzano, Masseria, Luciano or even Al Capone. Whoever the originator, the consensus leans towards a traditional Italian family which emigrated from Italy and who revised the custom in America of the secret society of 'Omerta.' Influenced by such a society, Mario Puzo developed a dramatic story called 'The Godfather' about a successful Patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) from Italy who founded an Olive Oil business and expanded it into other less legitimate areas including, strong arm protection, extortion, prostitution and gambling. Now with the family's fortune expanding and gaining political influence as well, the head of the family wishes to transfer his power to his eldest son, 'Santino' Corleone (James Caan) and retire. However, a new opportunity arrives in the form of an Italian mobster named, Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo( Al Lettieri) who wants to start importing illegal drugs. Advised by his step-son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that despite the danger, there is a fortune to be made in the trade. Refusing to get involved, the Don becomes a target for Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) and other rival families and is plunged into a gang war, resulting in his own assassination and the attacks of many including his eldest son. That's when his youngest son Michael Corlone (Al Pacino) enters the family business and has a major task ahead. While this immense sage expands over the years and the American countryside, the family develops despite major setbacks, but as Michael promises, 'I'm gonna wait till I become a Godfather, then I will initiate my plan.' The movie has established itself as a monumental Classic and become immensely popular, spawning other similar films and catch-phrases such as 'I'm gonna make him an Offer, he can't refuse.' A dramatic action film which reminds us, a movie can make heroes as well as scapegoats out of arriving immigrants. ****",9,2,5,30 November 2008
