Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049
","When the original came out in 1982, I was a kid. The movie was probably a bit advanced for an elementary schooler, but as the film moved along, I found it to be all but mesmerizing. In the ensuing years, I have watched that film at least 20 times. It holds up better than any other science fiction movie I have seen to repeated viewing.Looking back, that had to do with the script more so than Ridley Scott's direction. The actors were well cast and they gave excellent performances (except for Leon).Fast forward 35 years. Denis Villneuve is the director of the sequel, and Ryan Gosling plays K, a replicant blade runner. Gosling (and Ana de Armas, and Mackenzie Davis, for that matter) spends long periods of time in this film's rather lengthy scenes gazing meaningfully at the camera. This does nothing to move the plot forward, or show the audience anything about the character. I don't blame Gosling and the other actors for this pseudo acting. I have seen Ryan in older movies, where he actually performed, as opposed to gazing meaningfully. This movie simply is poorly edited, and poorly directed.I also noticed a bit of disjointedness among all of the meaningful stares. I have a feeling there were a few rewrites in the course of the filmmaking. The scene in Las Vegas when K meets Deckard seemed haphazardly thrown together.The original film was based on a Philip Dick novel, and it is admittedly slightly reductive to say Dick's book had a bit of a philosophical bent.In my opinion, the sequel tries a bit too hard to show, with visuals, how deep it is (the love scene with Joi comes to mind). I blame the director for this as well.As for the sound, other reviewers have described it well - The sound effects are probably the worst feature, loud, grating and unnecessary. Multiple scenes of gratuitous violence and gore add nothing to the plot.Including the eardrum-bursting 'Music' Sitting at the back I could watch as people's heads slumped to one side, only to be jolted awake by an especially loud synthesizer swell.The movie's music is sometimes too loud. It reminds me of the movie Interstellar. It's hard to appreciate certain scenes when the music is too loud.To these comments, I can only concur. Vangelis' score from the 1982 film was much better than this discordant, heavy handed attempt.This movie was advertised heavily for months (Sony fully intends to make that $180 million back quickly, judging by all those commercials/trailers). Denis Villneuve's sequel is barely worth two and a half hours, and is not worth the price of admission.",5,10,21,8 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Good not great
","I enjoyed this film. I went in knowing it was aimed at a teen audience, and was not actually for anyone over 30.Holland is not the best guy for this role, though he gamely tries to carry it off. The actors playing Peter's classmates are fairly convincing as high schoolers. The writing and performances are solid here. Keaton does well as Toomes/The Vulture, as I knew he would.I take issue with Tony Stark's suit for Peter. It does not belong in this movie (or any of the Maguire/Garfield films, for that matter). This seems like an attempt to sell toys. He's not Iron Man Jr., he's Spidey. No need for all that tech, as other reviewers have noted.Speaking of some of the other reviewers... their vitriol seems a bit unwarranted to me (railing against 'SJW' and 'Political Correctness'). One person wrote: '...with typical modern Hollywood touch to blackwash characters. Peter Parker's stepmom is now Mexican (?), girlfriend African and his best buddy Malaysian. How about that for a zoo? Minus 2 stars for that.' Another arch conservative wrote: '...Filled with unnecessary SJW agenda that Marvel will probably build up to full force in Black Panther and Captain Marvel. Zendaya's character is nothing but a full throttle SJW who protests and refuses to appropriate to society.' Um, a zoo? That's not a loaded/pejorative term at all, coming from a conservative describing non-whites.I guess I don't read enough 'conservative' new sites, as this is the first time I have ever heard of the term 'blackwash'.A question - How exactly is MJ supposed to 'appropriate to society'? Google Translate doesn't seem to work on this phrase.I don't think these reviewers even paid attention to the film, as a significant amount of what they write is blatantly inaccurate.Last but not least, I must add this. Spider-Man, like many of the Marvel titles, is set in New York City. One of, if not the, most diverse places in the country. Even if these conservatives go back to the comics from the 1980s, they will see that even then there was diversity depicted in the Amazing Spider-Man and the Spectacular Spider-Man. And it wasn't just Joe Robertson (Glory Grant, Cloak of Cloak and Dagger, Luke Cage and quite a few others).I have a suggestion for these conservatives who find movies like this so objectionable. The cast lists for major characters of these movies are available before the openings, so one can see which actor plays which character. And this and other sites show previews. How about you guys help Make Hollywood Great Again and just don't give these horrible diverse movies your money.",6,1,4,23 July 2017
Gone Girl," Save two hours plus of your life for something better than this
","There are times when a bad ending ruins a decent film. That isn't quite the case, here.In this movie, something much worse takes place. An insulting, ridiculous, completely implausible, ending makes a poor film utterly execrable.SPOILERS.The thing is, Amy is more like Basic Instinct's Catherine than she is like Nora Charles. She is pretty much a psychopath, and by the end of this movie, she's gone off the rails; she is just plain GONE.Here's how another reviewer put it: '...she (Amy) tries to frame her husband for murder, which would get him put on death row, when someone else gives her shelter she murders him, but only after she uses him to get pregnant so she can guilt her husband into getting back together. She is unapologetic about all of it, and at the end, THEY GET BACK TOGETHER. And it's not even like Ben Affleck's character is just oblivious, he knows everything, right down to the fact that the kid isn't his! But he lets her get away with it because... I dunno, because she makes great gnocchi! Better answer than the movie will give you! Considering she admitted to murdering Neil Patrick Harris in front of him...' At the end of this movie, Nick is telling his sister that he has to stay with Amy, because REASONS.After this scene with Nick and his sister, I was ready to throw things at my hi def TV. And I actually like my TV. I watch worthwhile shows and films on it, usually. And, it would cost much more than I paid for it to replace it, these days. I say this to demonstrate how put off, let down, and truly disgusted I was by this film and its so-called script.Do not waste two hours plus of your life on this poor excuse for a psychological thriller.",2,8,14,15 December 2014
Wonder Woman," It was okay
","Gal Gadot would not have been my first choice for this role. At times, her speech seemed stilted. I know she's not American, but maybe the director should have dubbed her lines or something.Chris Pine was fine as Steve. Funny, decent in the action scenes. The rest of the cast was good in general, and props to Robin Wright as General Antiope. She did well in that role.A side note to reviewers decrying this movie as politically correct. I imagine, to these folks, that feminism = PC, and they dislike the feminism on display. Just one thing about that - how is a Wonder Woman movie going to be anything but feminist? This objection's a bit like a vegan going to a steakhouse, and complaining about the menu.There are plenty of superhero films with more than the standard level of machismo (and I am a guy who doesn't mind that). The Punisher, most of the Batman movies from the last 15 years and pretty much any Arnold Schwarzenegger movie ever made come to mind.",7,3,10,23 July 2017
