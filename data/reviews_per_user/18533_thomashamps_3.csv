Raiders of the Lost Ark," Entertainment at its best
","If all you ask of a movie is that it is entertaining, that it helps you escape your everyday life and lets you just sit back and enjoy the spectacle then this fits the bill perfectly. It's fast paced, well acted, funny, exciting and full of classic scenes.Harrison Ford is at his best, as is Spielberg. Together they make Indy's race against the Nazis to find the Lost Ark a true classic slice of entertainment. I loved this film as a kid and I still love it now.",9,0,0,14 September 2000
Fargo," Ya! That's a good one!
","This is a great film. It is that simple. The cast are all superb. As is the script, the direction and everything else. It's extremely fuuny in places and is all held together by a great story full of little twists and turns. But it is the characters that kept me hooked. From Buscemi's weasily small-time crook to McDormand's pregnant cop to the guy sweeping his driveway and through every other person you meet along the way, you can see them all as real people. If you haven't seen it, see it. Then watch it again and again.",9,0,0,14 September 2000
Goodfellas," A true classic
","This is the gangster film at its finest. Scorsese is on top form as are Pesci and De Niro. Liotta has never bettered the performance he gives here. The film starts as it means to go on - violent, full of profanity, fast paced and very stylish. The story follows Liotta's character from boy to man as he climbs his way up through the ranks of organised crime. We see all the highs and lows of his life and meet a host of very believable and very undesirable characters along the way. It's a film full of memorable scenes whilst remaining much more than the sum of its individual parts at the same time. This is what all movies should be like. It draws you in and won't let you out of its grasp at any point. When it finishes you feel exhausted and exhilarated at the same time. If ever the word 'masterpiece' was meant to be used, it was for this film.",9,170,263,13 September 2000
