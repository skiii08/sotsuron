Raiders of the Lost Ark," I love 'Raiders'
",I've seen this movie about 30 times and I still love it!  My brother and I use to watch it almost every weekend when we got it on video tape when I was a kid.  I could probably tell you what is going on in the film with my eyes closed and the sound on.  I plan to see it at least another 30 times in my life.,10,0,0,20 May 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Lots of fun
","Just saw this movie again for Halloween.  It's a great littleHalloween movie.  It's lots and lots of fun.  There is a couple ofholes in the plot if one scrutinizes it too much.  Johnny Depp issuperb as usual.  Christian Ricci was good, too.  Christopher Leeshowed up in brief cameo but at least he showed up.  The actorwho plays the headless horseman with a head is the perfect actorfor the part.  Visually it is absolutely beautiful.  I loved the setdesign and cinematography.  It is gory and not everyone will likethat.  The headless horseman does decapitate people, after all. Highly recommended.  One of Burton's best.",7,1,2,2 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Despite its flaws its a lot of fun
","I'll let everyone know right off the bat that I'm a big 'Star Wars' fan.  I have seen the original trilogy many times and plan to see it many more times.  I also played with all the toys when I was a kid, I even had a C-3PO case to keep them all in.  The big problems which have been stated countless times are the dialogue and the romance.  George Lucas needs someone who can write good dialogue to co-write the screenplay with him for episode 3.  The romance was weak though it was not as bad as I expected it to be from what I was told.  Still the Anakin's line about the sand being course has to be one of the most unromantic lines ever and also one of the worst lines in movie history.         On the positive side the story was interesting.  The action sequences were great, especially Yoda (everyone was cheering!). The characters were all interesting, too.  And, of course John Williams' music was great.  In enjoyed Christopher Lee as the bad guy (he always makes good bad guys).  He just turned 80 so I hope he stays alive for Episode 3.  Fortunately all of 'Lord of the Rings' has been filmed so if he was to croak tomorrow it wouldn't affect that but it would 'Star Wars.'      I give this film a 7/10.  And I can't wait for Episode 3.",7,0,0,23 May 2002
Paths of Glory," Very good film and ahead of it's time
","This Stanley Kubrick masterpiece still holds up well nearly forty fiveyears after it was released.  Because it was made in 1957 thereare some dated elements, but it still a very powerful, sad, andsearing indictment against the insanity of war.      It was not the first American film that was an anti-war film but itwas probably the first in a long time.  Of course it was about aterrible incident that happened in the French Army during WorldWar I.  Americans weren't ready for a movie that might critique theUnited State's army.  The French were the 'good guys' in WWI butin this movie it shows a terrible general who not only tries to kill hisown men because they cannot fight like he wants them too, buthas three innocent men executed for cowardice as punishment fornot winning an unwinnable battle.  It reminded me of a spoiled kidwho couldn't get his way so he lashes out on the other kids thatare weaker than him.  Same mentality. Kirk Douglas gave a very good performance, as a man, soldier,and lawyer who sees the injustice and cannot say much, but trieshis best to save these innocent men.  When he tells the onegeneral 'You can go to hell before I apologize to you or anyoneelse!' it means a lot.  Of course back in the 50's they did not usethat language as much so it meant a lot. The battle scenes were quite good for the 50's.  I especiallyliked the mise on scen in the general's mansion. Incidentally the young German singing at the end is ChristianeKubrick, Stanley's third and final wife.  I guess he found the rightwoman, they were married in 57 or 58 and stayed married until hissudden death in March 99, four months before 'Eyes Wide Shut'came out.",10,0,1,2 October 2003
Bruce Almighty," I laughed
","A lot of people on this site don't seem to like this film.  I thought itwas really funny.  Granted it was no masterpiece (though oneperson on this sight thought it was) I really enjoyed it.  A lot ofpeople did not like the serious aspects of the film.  I thought thatworked well, too.  It really would be hard being God for a week ifone got the chance.  Also I loved Morgan Freeman as God, hisportrayal is not to far from the God I believe in. The parting of theRed Soup really got me laughing. So did when Bruce had to dealwith prayers. 9/10.",9,0,1,20 October 2003
Before Sunrise," Has the best line in any film ever made
","I'm not the biggest fan of romances but this is a good one.  The reason is because the dialogue is realistic and the acting by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is very good.  The things that they talk about are the type of things that I like to talk about.  I still love the line that he uses to convince her to spend the day with him in Vienna.  If you haven't seen the film it is worthwhile just to hear this line.  I've even used it myself, though it didn't quite work as well as it did in the movie.  Oh, well at least I got to use it.",10,2,4,3 May 2002
The Thin Red Line," My favorite film of all time
","For me, this film was great.  It did not just deal with war but with suffering and the meaning of life.  This film actually gave me a sense of peace after watching it.  This film is a war film but much more than that it is a film that challenges people to think about life in ways that they may never have before.  The cinematography was beautiful, the performance, especially by Jim Caviezel were superb, and the battle scenes were harrowing and extremely well done.  I was glad Terrence Malick decided to make this film (since he had not done a film since 1978's 'Days of Heaven').  It's a masterpiece.",10,2,5,20 May 2002
