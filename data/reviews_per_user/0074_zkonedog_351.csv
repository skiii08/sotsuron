The Devil's Advocate," Somewhat A Mess, But Oh So Intriguing
","'The Devil's Advocate' is a strange motion picture. In some ways, it is a complete and utter mess. Yet, it touches on such interesting themes and contains such great acting that it is tough to rank it as anywhere near 'bad'.For a basic plot summary, 'Devil's Advocate' sees hotshot lawyer Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves) move from his small southern practice to the 'big time' in New York with wife Mary Ann (Charlize Theron). Employed by the mysterious John Milton (Al Pacino), Kevin begins to realize that his 'dream job' may be a bit more complicated (and ultimately cosmic) than he could have possibly imagined.In terms of acting, this film is top-notch through and through. Al Pacino was born to play the nefarious Milton, Reeves gives a solid performance as the conflicted lawyer, and Theron is startling as the mentally-slipping (or is she?) wife. For fans specifically of Pacino watching this film to see one of his 'rants', you will not be disappointed, either.The conflicting part of the movie, however, lies in its multitude of themes. Such topics as 'God vs. Devil', 'Innocence vs. Guilt', 'Small-Town vs. Big City', 'Ethics vs. Greed', and 'Husband vs. Wife' are touched upon. Each theme in and of itself is extremely interesting and could carry the film without the others, but the problem is that they all smooshed together for two and a half hours. Just when you think the movie is about one thing...BAM, it switches to something else. While that filmmaking is admirable in terms of keeping the viewers glued to the screen, director Taylor Hackford could have done a much better job of sorting things out to produce a clean, crisp narrative, instead of one that jumps so often from theme to theme.Overall, this was one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. The acting and plot elements are incredible, but it just tries to do too much and gets lost within itself at times. It could have been epic, but instead (because of those flaws) settles for 'above average'. If you are a Pacino or Reeves fan, or just like movies that will make you think, 'The Devil's Advocate' is very much worth a viewing. It may not fit together perfectly, but you'll be thinking about it long after the TV is turned off.",7,1,2,8 March 2017
Ford v Ferrari," Entertaining In Every Way A Film Can Be
","I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of 'Ford v Ferrari'. Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of 'Ford v Ferrari' is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of 'big corporation screwing over the little guy' thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to 'Ford v Ferrari'. It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present.",9,2,2,17 February 2020
The Blair Witch Project," A Precursor To 'Paranormal Activity' (But Probably Even Better At What It Does)
","Just recently, I read Stephen King's horror treatise 'Danse Macabre'. In that book, he discusses 'The Blair Witch Project' as one of the most frightening movies he has ever seen. I decided to watch it on that recommendation, and I came away fascinated by the experience.For a basic plot summary, 'Blair Witch' focuses on a group of three friends trying to produce an independent documentary about the so-called Blair Witch that haunts the woods surrounding a rural town. At first, the documentary seems to be going quite while, but when the trio gets lost in the woods and strange things start happening, things take a turn for the worse.Sadly, history will probably only remember this film for the controversy that surrounded it at the theater (people thinking that the documentary was actually a real thing). While it isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, it does produce some genuine emotion by touching on some very deep themes.Basically, this movie preys on those all-too-human emotions in which the 'monster behind the door' (as King himself describes it) is much more scary when it is unseen. SPOILER ALERT HERE: During the entire entire, viewers never even catch so much as a glimpse of whatever/whoever is causing the strange happenings. It's the ultimate 'devil you don't know' story.Yet, 'Blair Witch' also works on a more human-drama level. Much like the later 'Cloverfield', it is filmed entirely in the shaky-cam style, trying to be as close to human reality as possible. As the three hikers slowly begin to realize just how hopelessly lost they have become, parts of the film become a sort of character study in panic and emotion. Viewers begin to wonder 'would I react the same way in a similar situation?'Overall, I was more intrigued by 'Blair Witch' than anything. It is amazing to me how a movie so stark and completely devoid of any conjured drama (no soundtrack, no 'jump scenes', etc.) can still be a bit unsettling to watch. I have also seen the first 'Paranormal Activity' movie, and I don't understand why that is viewed with such reverence while 'Blair Witch' has to fight for every inch, so to speak. They are the same type of movie, but this effort actually shows the descent into panic/madness better than 'Paranormal' ever did.",6,1,1,4 March 2017
Despicable Me 2," Silly Fun (With A Little Emotion Thrown In)
","The first 'Despicable Me' effort introduced audiences to the goofy, rambunctious Minions as well as the relationship between villain-turned-good guy Gru and his three little girls. The second movie plays to those same strengths and offers more Minion mayhem and more heartfelt moments.For a basic plot summary, 'Despicable Me 2' sees Gru (voice of Steve Carell) recruited by secret agent Lucy (Kristin Wiig) to join the newly-formed Anti-Villain league. Though at first nonplussed by the offer and content to be just 'Dad' to Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and sweet little Agnes (Elsie Kate Fisher), Gru begins to feel the tug of adventure once again (as well as perhaps a bit of a romantic fling as well?!) and is quickly caught up in the world-saving game again.In terms of comedy and adventure, this movie provides it in spades! It's amazing that it took this many years of human history to think up such hilarious characters as Minions, as they can make even the most sourpuss among us crack a smile (and have most of us rolling in the aisles!). Their crazy antics are unrivaled in the history of animated feature films.There is also a nice little touch of emotion in the movie involving Gru finding a partner (or mother, as asked for by Agnes). I actually wish the movie would have focused on this movie, as a more developed and focused emotional aspect could have easily vaulted it to five-star status.Overall, though, 'Despicable Me 2' is fine comedic fare for anyone who enjoyed the original. The girls might touch you, the Minions will have you laughing throughout, and Carell's Gru is such a crazy character that he is a joy to watch. A fun film for the entire family.",7,1,1,6 March 2017
Moneyball," A New Way To Think
","I've been a baseball fan for the better part of two decades. As such, I vividly remember the events surrounding the 2002 Oakland Athletics that are the prime content of this film. 'Moneyball' does an incredible job of recreating the nostalgia of those events, as well as telling the story behind them that likely was not known at the time.For a basic plot summary, 'Moneyball' focuses on the character of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), the GM of the Oakland A's who realizes in the early 2000s that he can't spend with the 'big boys' (e.g. New York) that comprised his competition. As such, with the help of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and to the consternation of A's manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Beane uses the statistical analyses popularized by Bill James to build a team capable of dethroning the Yankees on a shoestring budget.The hallmark of this film is that, to the viewer, it really won't matter if you're familiar with this story. The narrative works either way:If your a newbie to all this 'baseball-o-nomics' stuff, 'Moneyball' does a great job of breaking things down and giving you the 'Reader's Digest' version of the Moneyball concept. You don't even have to be a baseball fan to 'get it', as Beane's mindset and principles can be utilized in many walks of life.For those (like I) who devoured 'Moneyball' in print form, it is just flat out amazing to see the events played out on the big screen. Those of us who have been intrigued by the whole concept since those 'early years' can sit back and be amazed by how it has truly changed the game. The fact that a great deal of actual baseball footage is used only adds to the effect.About the only nitpick I can possibly find with this film is that the choreographed baseball scenes are not always entirely accurate. This is a small nitpick, of course, but one that bugged me just a bit considering how easy it would have been to fix.Overall, 'Moneyball' is a fantastic re-telling at perhaps the most revolutionary concept to ever be introduced to the sport...using in-depth statistical analysis to mine for talent that may be lost to the human eye. Whether a hard-core baseball nut or just a casual movie-goer, 'Moneyball' will impress you...just in different ways.",10,2,3,11 March 2017
Blade Runner 2049," Better Than The Original
","Before this movie came out, I went back and watched the original Blade Runner again (my second viewing of it). Neither viewing of that first one impressed me. Ridley Scott's original is a bit of a muddled mess of half-baked plots, odd characters, albeit containing stunning visuals (especially for the time). The only reason I had any interest in its sequel is that this one is directed by one of my favorite Hollywood helmers, Dennis Villeneuve. He 'does it again' with '2049', of course, managing to put together a film that both pays homage to Scott's controversial original as well as crafts an even better, more interesting story than that film ever dreamed of.For a basic plot summary, '2049' focuses on K (Ryan Gosling), a new type of Replicant in a post-Tyrell Corp. world. Through the course of an investigation (he's with the LAPD), K and boss Joshi (Robin Wright) discover that Replicants are now able to give birth...a revelation that is both shocking (shouldn't be possible) and terrifying (would induce panic among the colonies). As such, K is dispatched to find the 'miracle child' and dispose of it by any means necessary. This includes a trip to new business head honcho Wallace (Jared Leto), as well as discovering that Deckert (Harrison Ford) may still play a role in all of this.Likely because of Villeneuve's mastery behind the camera, '2049' is a film with a very defined, follow-able plot. At no time was I ever really lost or frustrated with the proceedings (as happened multiple times during my viewings of the original). Clearly, this sequel is less about 'noir' (establishing an atmosphere) and more about actually following through with plot structure and characters. To me, that makes it considerably better than its predecessor because of this next point:Even though it is a much more streamlined movie, it still creates a wonderful sense of atmosphere. The visuals here are stunning, and all the environments are interesting in their own right, filled with grandiose images/artifacts and futuristic color schemes. I don't think there is a scene in this movie that isn't filmed from behind some sort of crazy filter, but none of it ever really gets too distracting, either.A Blade Runner film will probably never be my absolute favorite type of filmmaking. Even on its best day, it forgoes much potential plot nuance in favor of visuals and atmosphere. Even clocking in at nearly 3 hours, however, Villeneuve's '2049' easily held my interesting all the way through, and that is something I never expected from this film.Overall, I think this is a film that will be enjoyed by most who watch it. If you are a big fan of the original, there's enough of that here for you. If you were ambivalent (like me) towards Scott's first one, rest assured that this one is much easier to follow and understand exactly what is transpiring. A win-win situation for all involved.",8,3,16,18 February 2018
Million Dollar Arm," I Really Wanted To Like This Movie, But...
","I saw this movie in theaters for two reasons: 1. I'm a huge baseball fan; and 2. I watch Med Men (i.e. the Jon Hamm factor). Even after 20 or so minutes, when I knew exactly what this movie would be, I still really, really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, this one is schmaltzy 'Disney' through and through.For a basic plot summary, 'Million Dollar Arm' tells the story of how sports agent J.B. Bernstein (Hamm) starts a competition called Million Dollar Arm in order to find a major league baseball player from the relatively untapped market of India. The two athletes he finds, Rinku (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh (Madhur Mittal), are in for quite a culture shock as they travel to America for the first time and have to essentially learn baseball from scratch.First of, let me be clear in that I'm not attaching a star-ranking to the overall story here. It is truly a fascinating and inspiring tale for baseball fans and human-interest fans alike.As a movie, though, 'Million Dollar Arm' falls far short of being great. The main problem? It doesn't have a clear focus, so it tries to do too much and doesn't really nail anything. This could have been a hard-core baseball fan movie. It could have been a love story. It could have been a redemption story. It could have been a new culture assimilation piece. Had the filmmakers looked at the story through just one of those three scopes (and just bolstered it with shades of the others), it would really have worked.Unfortunately, director Craig Gillespie (or maybe the Disney producers) tries to cram every single theme possible into one movie. It really feels like the old 'throw the kitchen sink at 'em' method in terms of trying to evoke every possible emotion from the audience. I realize that this movie is supposed to have a broad, family-based appeal, but but focusing on everything the producers ended up focusing on nothing.The two biggest wastes in this movie? 1. Hamm, a terrific actor who plays as transparent of a character as one can see on screen; and 2. The fact that hard-core baseball fans like myself will not enjoy the baseball aspects of this movie. It is made for the family set first and foremost.Thus, though I wanted very badly to enjoy this movie and all the right pieces existed for that to happen, they just didn't come together. The 'Indian culture' angle was interesting, but not nearly as compelling as, say, 'Slumdog Millionaire', and recently baseball-themed movies like 'Trouble with the Curve' and 'Moneyball' will appeal much more to the die-hards.",4,1,1,4 March 2017
Angels & Demons," Suspend Belief, Enjoy Thoroughly!
","Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, '24'. You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive 'dark matter' compound. Much like in 'The DaVinci Code', everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read 'one more chapter' before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion. When looked back upon, the pieces may not fit together or even seem downright ludicrous, but it was one heck of a ride!",7,1,2,12 March 2017
First Man," Far Too Dour To Be Anything Close To Inspirational
","There is no doubt that the moon landing was a seminal moment in United States history. However, that landing took place in 1969. Since that time, it has been covered in more books and forms of media than can probably even be counted. So, in order for 'First Man' to tell an original or engaging story, it would seem to have to find an angle, whether that be cultural or character-based. Sadly, neither of those things happen here.For a basic plot summary, 'First Man' is a biopic of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), especially focusing on the events leading up to and transpiring during his infamous moon landing mission in '69. Key factors in his backstory include the death of daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford), relationship with wife Janet (Claire Foy), and just his overall attitude and demeanor as an individual.The problem with 'First Man' is very easy to diagnose: it has absolutely no soul, instead choosing a very mechanical beat-by-beat description of the Gemini and Apollo missions that led up to the moon landing. Two main missteps really hamper the proceedings here:1. Only lip service is paid to the social conventions or frustrations of the day, and that is a shame. Had this movie focused on, say, the controversy over the space program itself or its place in a culture going through the civil rights movement, then maybe it would have had something emotional to examine. As it is, this is about as mechanical of a film (just plodding forward) as you'll ever see.2. Even a bigger faux pas is portraying Armstrong and his wife as so dour and lacking in any real emotion. I'm not sure if this was just bad writing or an interpretation of the real-life figures themselves, but either way it is inexcusable. Emotional moments are telegraphed left and right only to fizzle out with Gosling's Armstrong looking dour and serious and Foy's Janet coming across as cold in comparison. It's been awhile since I've seen a film with so little emotion, especially odd considering they are trying to describe a cultural touchstone moment that everyone who saw remembers vividly!I had been anticipating 'First Man' for quite some time. Director Damien Chazelle's 'La La Land' is a favorite of mine, as is Gosling, and the trailers/concept seemed incredible. I left the theater feeling incredibly disappointed, however, at such a wasted opportunity. One can't really call this film 'bad' in the sense that it was technically deficient, but it just lacked any reason to care about any part of it.",6,5,10,15 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Just Like The Book; The Weakest Of The Bunch
","Back a year or so ago when I was reading the Hunger Games books, I considered 'Mockingjay' to be the weakest of the trilogy...and it wasn't even really close (IMHO). I was hoping that this film version (much like how I though the 'Catching Fire' movie was actually better than its piece of literature) would ignite more of a spark with me. As evidenced by the three-star rating, it did not. 'Mockingjay Part One' is not a bad movie, but it just happens to be based on the weakest book in the series.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) having been yanked from the Quarter Quell. She is now in the mysterious District Thirteen, where President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) is the leader of a rebellion aimed at overthrowing President Snow (Donald Sutherland) and the Capitol by uniting all the districts. In order to do this, Coin needs Katniss to relent to be the Mockingjay, or a powerful symbol of the rebellion. The problem? Katniss is more interested in reuniting with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is now a pawn in Snow's counter-scheme (but is he WILLING pawn, that is the big question). After consulting with Gale (Liam Hemsworth), Plutarch (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Katniss decides to take up the mantle. Of course, she cannot possibly imagine the consequences this decision may have on her future.Like I said, this isn't a terrible film. Director Francis Lawrence knows how to direct this series, and he understands how to get the most out of the material. The problem in this case IS the material. More specifically, the character of Katniss. In previous films/books, Katniss is the strong, central hero around which the entire plot revolves. In 'Mockingjay', though, I felt like the source material takes great leaps/liberties with her character to suit the story. For example, in previous material she can't stand the 'pomp and circumstance' surrounding her costumes and status. In this one, she immediately falls in love with her mockingjay costume and quickly steps forward as a figurehead. I know this is all supposed to be driven by her mad love for Peeta, but was that relationship really developed enough to truly make it seem believable?Part of my 'problem' with this film too, though, could be that I am a male adult. I am not the target (i.e. young adult) audience. The material of the Hunger Games is meant to suck in teen and young adult readers, first and foremost, with the 'big ideas' appealing more broadly. By the time 'Mockingjay' came around, however, the big ideas are running out, which means the love- triangle focus must narrow. So, a lot of it depends on how much you can 'buy in' to the teen romance.Overall, this is more of an 'incomplete' grade than anything. I fully expect the second part to be much, much better once the action can really progress to its conclusion. But I can't give the studios a pass on their money-grab either. This movie did not NEED to be split into two parts, but was only done so to extend the hype surrounding the franchise.",4,1,1,4 March 2017
Vertigo," The Master's Masterpiece
","One of the few criticisms I have of Alfred Hitchcock's work is that, at times, the viewer is very aware they are watching a 'Hitchcock film' and not all that focused on the plot/characters at hand. With 'Vertigo', however, Hitchcock creates a masterpiece that transcends most of his other films and takes his directing to a whole new level.For a basic plot summary, 'Vertigo' tells the story of Mr. Ferguson (James Stewart), a one-time detective whose fear of heights (or vertigo) now keeps him grounded. However, when a close friend hires Ferguson to track the whereabouts of his wife (played by Kim Novak), Ferguson is pulled into a web of intrigue and the paranormal far deeper than he could ever imagine, even to the point of having to finally confront the fear that cripples him inside.There is nothing I can nit-pick about this film. Period. It is truly a cinematic masterpiece that hits all the right buttons. The plot is infinitely engaging, and filled with enough twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat right up to the ending credits. The characters are well-acted and progress in interested ways as the reels keep spinning, making you actually care what happens to Stewart and Novak's characters. Then, of course, there is the direction from Hitch, who ties everything together perfectly with his mix of unique film techniques (using Technicolor in ways it had likely never been used before), interesting visual angles, and fast-paced, yet at the same time touching, plot angles.Like I said, within a few minutes (once Hitch makes his ubiquitous cameo), you'll never have that nagging feeling that this movie is only good because Hitch's name is attached to it. Instead, you'll be completely drawn into everything unfolding in front of you, perhaps even needing to be reminded at the end that it was a Hitchcock film in the first place.Thus, I consider 'Vertigo' to be not only Hitchcock's best film, but also one of the best films of all-time. It just doesn't do anything wrong, and does oh so many things right.",10,2,5,11 March 2017
Changeling," Cements Eastwood As Top Director
","For the past 5-10 years, I have enjoyed watching the supreme acting talents of Clint Eastwood in films such as Bloodwork, Million Dollar Baby, and (most recently) Gran Torino. This film, however, also cements Eastwood as not only a top actor, but also a spectacular director.The plot of the film centers on the story of Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), who after having her son Walter go missing for a few months is reunited...with the wrong boy. However, in order to save themselves some bad publicity, the Los Angeles Police Department insists that the boy IS indeed her son and, once drawn into the lie, will do whatever it takes (including institutionalizing Collins) to make sure that the truth about her case is never known. At the same time as Collins' story is playing out, the real abductor of her son, Gordon Northcott, is being investigated for the brutal murder of perhaps as many as 20 young boys, of which Walter may or may not be one of.Like most of Eastwood's more recent films, this movie resonates with the audience in multiple ways. While watching, you will sympathize with Christine Collins over the screw-job she is getting from the LAPD, while also be horrified at the Northcott case not only because of what he did, but because he was allowed to keep doing so while the LAPD were trying to save face. Of course, you never know how much 'creative license' (think Denzel Washington's portrayal of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter as a complete innocent) a director takes within a film, but in this case I trust the judgment of Eastwood. Plus, even if the LAPD were only half as bad as portrayed by Eastwood, they would still be responsible for the despicable acts brought down upon Christine Collins.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the film, though, is the performance by Angelina Jolie as Collins. While better know for her blatantly sexual roles in such films as 'Tomb Raider', 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith', and 'Wanted', Eastwood is able to do a complete makeover on Jolie, turning her into a character that we can all root for, and not just for her body. I gained a lot of respect for Jolie's acting talents by watching this film.In a final touch, Eastwood also infuses his own simple brand of music into the film. Whereas in 'Million Dollar Baby' it was the simple plinking of piano keys, in 'Changeling' it is the simplistic strumming of a guitar that provides what little dramatic backdrop is needed to the storytelling. Eastwood knows that the story alone is compelling enough, so instead of opting for a dramatic score he just keeps it simple, which was the correct choice.Thus, I recommend this film to anyone who just wants to watch a really interesting, true dramatic story. Though some of the subject matter may be a bit intense for the faint of heart, it needs to be that way in order to convey the horrific events surrounding the case of Christine Collins and her son Walter. Like nearly every Clint Eastwood project, whether acting, directing, or producing, this one will have you thinking about its events long after viewing.",9,1,2,11 March 2017
Men in Black 3," As Much Fun As You'll Ever Have At The Theater
","The first two 'Men In Black' movies were successful because of a simple Hollywood 'formula': fun. By combining goofy aliens, cool gadgets, great acting, funny sight gags, wise-cracking humor, and enough of a plot to actually make you care about all that is transpiring, those movies were so genre-diverse that one almost can't help but find something to like. After a ten year break from the action, however, there was no guarantee that the lightning could be caught in the bottle once again for MIB3. Luckily, this film not only proves itself worthy, but actually clocks in as the best installment in the series to date.For a basic plot summary, MIB3 sees a rogue alien escape from captivity and, through time- travel, wreak havoc on the MIB organization by causing Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) to no longer exist. As such, Agent J (Will Smith) must travel back to 1969 in order to set things straight, along the way meeting up with the younger K (Josh Brolin).Like its predecessors, this movie is just pure fun, through and through. The time spent watching it will fly by (no boredom here!) as every scene contains some interesting nugget, whether comically, emotionally, or just plain exciting. Essentially, MIB3 is the perfect balance between 'summer popcorn flick' & 'film series you truly care about'. While humor, action, and adventure are present throughout the film, the ending of the movie even takes an emotionally-charged tone that will likely have you completely stunned and perhaps even pulling out a tissue or two.Of course, the acting within this film is probably what truly makes it a great experience, though. Will Smith slips effortlessly into his old 'black suit' role, while Brolin is spot-on as the young K. Jones is, well, pretty much the same old Jones, but with an added character twist that really does help explain his character's gruff exterior.Simply put, MIB3 vaults this trilogy into serious consideration when considering the 'greatest trilogies of all time' debate. It is pure fun, but with enough emotion to make you care about the characters. Even after 10 years away, the black suits are indeed still as fresh as ever!",9,1,3,7 March 2017
Frost_Nixon," A Battle Of Intellects
","After the Watergate event that precipitated the demise of President Nixon, the nation anxiously waited for the interview that would very likely define the Nixon legacy. 'Frost/Nixon' chronicles the process behind (and during) that very interview.For a basic plot summary, the film looks at two primary areas: the creation of the interview, which includes the odd choice of David Frost (Michael Sheen), and then the actual interview of Nixon (Frank Langella) itself, depicted as a battle of intellectual wits between both camps.What really makes this movie stand out is the incredible tension that director Ron Howard creates. Because of the deceit that Watergate perpetuated, as well as the pardon of Nixon by Gerald Ford that left much of the nation feeling that justice had not been served, this interview felt more important than just a few hours of airtime. Howard really captures that intensity, especially towards the end during the part of the interview that is now so well-known.On a quick note, Langella is as good of a 'Nixon' as is humanly possible. At times, when the camera angle and his posture is right, you'll think that the former President is actually on screen himself.If you lived through that time period and remember it well, this film will likely flood you with a wave of nostalgia (both good and bad). However, I was born in 1985 and was STILL entranced by this film, knowing hardly anything going in about the interview.Thus, for all fans of political/cultural dramas, this is a worthwhile watch. It could have done a few things better, but overall it accomplishes its mission nicely: to re-create the importance and cultural relevance of those Frost/Nixon interviews.",8,1,1,11 March 2017
Walk the Line," One For The Ages
","When it comes to biographical films, 'Walk The Line' may be at the top of the heap for its ability to portray its subjects with an energy that never wavers. It is a great story filled with compelling drama, and I also can't think of a film that features such great music.For a basic plot summary, 'Walk The Line' tells the story of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix), who we all know ends up being one of the most successful music performers of all-time. This film focuses on the early portions of his career/life, such as the impact his brother's death had on him at a young age, as well as his rocky relationship with first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin). Stern father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) is also given a decent amount of screen time. As John strikes gold in the music business, he is also visited by the temptations of that lifestyle, such as girls, booze, and drugs. Through it all, friend, fellow musician, and eventually partner June Carter (Reese Whitherspoon) shares in his ups and downs in the music business and helps him try to put his life back on the right track.There are three things in this movie that really make it stick out as an all-time classic:1. The acting; mainly the chemistry between Whitherspoon (who won an Oscar for her performance) and Phoenix, who is one of the most underrated actors of his time. When they are on screen together, it is magic every single team, whether in a singing scene or high drama. Also, it is fun to see the performances of other contemporaries of Cash, such as Elvis Presley (Tyler Hilton) and Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Payne). 2. The music. Though the movie is not a 'musical' by definition, its music scenes are perhaps the best I have ever seen in cinema. They are filled with so much energy that you can't help but start the foot-tapping or even singing along! I know that many would call this a 'sacrilegious' statement, but I really liked the vocals of Whitherspoon and Phoenix, so much so that despite loving the 'real Cash' too, I also own the official soundtrack for this film. 3. The story. I don't know how accurately the film portrays the little nuances of the Cash/Carter clans, but I know the over-arching story between the two and I think 'Walk The Line' does a great job in portraying the turmoil and the redemption. This is meant to be a high-octane, over- dramatic type piece anyway, and (like I mentioned before) the energy is just so great that it carries things right along.Put simply, 'Walk The Line' is one of my favorite films of all-time. Every time I view it, it takes me on an emotional roller-coaster visually, musically, and dramatically.",10,1,1,4 March 2017
Mission: Impossible III," Great Action But Lacks Originality/Characters
","After the widely-acclaimed disappointment that was 'Mission Impossible II' this third installment (helmed by the formidable JJ Abrams) provides some much-needed polish to a franchise in desperate need of it. Sadly, though, there are too many missed opportunities for character growth and plot for this movie to truly rise above an 'average' categorization.For a basic plot summary, 'MI3' sees Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) called back to the IMF one more time to save a fellow agent (played by Keri Russell). When that operation uncovers international villain Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Hunt is drawn into the chase in more ways than one when his wife-to-be Julia (Michelle Monaghan) is drawn into the plot as well.In terms of action/gadgets/technology/freneticism, this movie likely has what you are looking for. The nonstop action rivals anything that, say, a 'Bourne' or Jason Statham flick could ever produce, and the visuals are stunning and slick. For those only looking for action/adventure going in, there's no reason to be disappointed.At the same time, however, two fatal flaws exist in this film:First, the characters are mighty weak. Monaghan (though perfectly built for her role) is only 'the girl to be saved', Hoffman is a terrible villain, and the script doesn't really give Cruise all that much of an opportunity to grow.Second, the plot (while twisty/turny) is nothing that spy fans haven't seen countless times before. The names/places/dates may have been changed, but pretty much everything else is stock fare for espionage flicks.Overall, then, while JJ did polish up this franchise a bit, I felt that he didn't buff out enough of the imperfections to make it a truly great film. Enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it to rocket atop any 'best of' lists.",5,2,2,10 March 2017
Captain Phillips," What If It Happened To You?
","There are many unique aspects that make 'Captain Phillips' a Best Picture-nominee: incredible acting, high tension, and a plot that one wouldn't think could occur yet in the 21st century. To me, however, the hallmark of the movie was its ability to make viewers ask themselves the question 'what would I do in a similar scenario?'.For a basic plot summary, 'Captain Phillips' tells the story of Rich Phillips (Tom Hanks), captain of a shipping vessel that is boarded by a gang of Somali pirates led by Muse (Barkhad Abi). Looking to strike a a huge payday from an American ship, the pirates take Mr. Phillips as their hostage. However, despite their best efforts, the pirates are constantly set back by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips and his crew.The most striking experience of this whole film to me was this: Here we are in the year 2014, and we are still dealing with pirates! When people use that word nowadays, they are mostly referring to fictional characters with eye-patches flying the Jolly Roger skull-and-crossbones. The Somali pirates, though, are not of this variety. They are both ruthless and calculating, producing a visceral sense of fear that they could begin taking lives at any time.Thus, while watching the movie, I was constantly thinking 'how would I handle this situation?'. At the same time, I was amazed by the ingenuity and courage of Phillips in the face of a very, very frightening situation. Being based on a true story (although I honestly know nothing about the real Captain Phillips, so I can't vouch for accuracy whatsoever), this movie has a sense of 'real- world gravitas' to it, while at the same time producing incredibly high drama due to the unique situations it presents.As far as the acting is concerned, 'Captain Phillips' showcases some of the best. The tension between the Hanks and Abdi characters is palpable throughout, while the final few minutes of the film may be the best work Mr. Hanks has ever put up on the big screen (and what a statement that is!).Overall, then, 'Captain Phillips' is the film I would vote as 'Best Picture' at the 2014 Academy Awards. It is a film that can be enjoyed by all, not just appealing to a particular segment. Even if you 'know what is going to happen', so to speak (being based on a real person's experiences), the tension between Phillips and the Pirates will still have you on the edge of your seat.",8,1,3,4 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better The Second Time Around
","The first time I watched 'The Phantom Menace', I was extremely disappointed. Why? High expectations, I think. Upon a second viewing, however, I came to appreciate this film in the cannon much more than I previously had done.For a basic plot summary, 'Episode I' tells the very beginning story of how the Jedi Republic eventually fell to the Sith Empire. In this early effort, Jedi's Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) & Obi- Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) meet up with a very young Annakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), the boy who will eventually become Darth Vader. The Jedi Council (including Yoda!) is introduced, as well as the beginnings of Senator Palpatine's (Ian McDiarmid) treachery in deceiving the Galactic Senate. Also, a new Sith apprentice (Darth Maul) also plays a role in the proceedings.If you watched this movie close to the time it hit theaters (1999), you were likely disappointed for a number of different reasons. It had been such a long time since Star Wars was on the big screen that fans wanted 'everything at once', which this film does not deliver. Plus, the character of Darth Maul was so incredibly hyped at the time, then turned out as little more than a cool double-blade light saber (no personality development whatsoever).Without all that 'Star Wars is back!' hype, though, this movie stands pretty well on its own merits. It sets the very basic path for both the fall of the Republic & Annakin's turn to the Dark Side. It provides some incredible imagery and special effects. It introduces some new characters into the mix (despite the failure that is Jar-Jar Binks). It has one of the best musical codas ('Duel of the Fates') of any movie in history.I think what people need to remember about 'Phantom Menace' is that it was meant to lay the 'first stone' of the Star Wars mythology...nothing more, nothing less. Sure, a few characters/scenes fail to excite (e.g. Jar-Jar, extended pod racing), but overall it tells a good story and keeps the viewer engaged (while also throwing in enough 'OMG' moments to produce some wry smiles among Star Wars vets).Thus, though I really thought I would be giving this film 2-3 stars, it turned out to be much better than I had remembered it. I would even go 4.5 stars if possible. If you are having a Star Wars marathon, don't necessarily dread the two hours spent watching this one.",8,5,6,11 March 2017
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," It Tries, But Has No Base
","I hate to see a movie like this. I really, really do. 'Perks of Being A Wallflower' tries oh so hard to make itself emotionally relevant, but ultimately fails in that regard because it has no 'base' to fall back on.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Charlie (Logan Lerman), a new high school freshman who epitomizes the word 'wallflower'. Soon upon his arrival into high school, however, Charlie is taken under the wings of Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), who show him how to live it up and let go of some of his inhibitions.The main trouble with this movie (minor spoilers ahead) is that I feel the storytelling is backwards and thus the narrative never really plays out in any meaningful way. It's almost like the character development comes at the very end of the movie, when the characters have already been on screen for a long, long time. Thus, when the 'big emotional payoff' actually comes to fruition, it really doesn't because for so long the characters were just kind of floating along without a solid base.This whole experience strikes me as a prime example of 'the book being better than the movie'. I haven't read the book, but I'd almost bet money that it does a much better job of conveying the adolescent message than this movie does. This is even despite the fact that I thought the acting was actually pretty good. That wasn't the problem....the problem was the overall tone and plot devices.Thus, I couldn't get into 'Perks of Being A Wallflower' whatsoever because I didn't feel for the characters until the very end, and by then it was just too late. My exact star rating would be more like 1.5, but I bump it up a little because I think there was a sincere effort here to create a good movie. It just didn't work for me.",3,7,13,6 March 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," The Power Of Mystery
","A lot of times (too many times, really), viewers know everything about a film before they even take their seats in the theater. Trailers, promotional material, internet chatter or what you have, the standard film-advertising philosophy now is to show as much as possible to let viewers know exactly what they are getting and can expect. '10 Cloverfield Lane' breaks all those rules and is the better for it. Filmed almost entirely in secret at Bad Robot productions, a trailer didn't drop for the film until a scant 4-5 weeks before it premiered. Even that trailer didn't give away a cent of the plot. Because of this secrecy, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is able to do something that other films cannot (or will not): allow the mystery to unfold.For a basic plot summary, this film opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) fleeing her boyfriend due to some sort of relationship trouble. Her car is hit, she blacks out, and the next thing she knows is that she is waking up in some sort of bunker chained to the wall. She quickly discovers that she was pulled from the car wreck by Howard (John Goodman), a survivalist who has built a shelter meant to withstand any apocalyptic event. He tells her that the world is in chaos above ground due to some sort of attack (he cannot give exact details about who or what), and that line of reasoning seems to be confirmed by certain events that transpire and the word of Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the other bunker-mate. But is it really as simple as that? Is Howard truly the benefactor he seems to be?This is one of those films that can't be discussed too much more, because it so deeply relies on the mystery that spoilers can be deadly. Suffice it to say, though, that it truly is a gem in pretty much every aspect. The plot is full of twists, the atmosphere is legitimately tension-filled, and the acting is top-notch all around. It has been quite some time since I've been to a film where I've become that sucked into the events transpiring, but again that is because I was a completely blank slate going in. After the first 15-20 minutes of the experience, I had absolutely no clue what would happen next, and that is one of my favorite types of movie-watching experiences. J.J. Abrams' 'Mystery Box' is alive and well in this one!Of course, one can't review '10 Cloverfield Lane' without commenting on its lineage with 'Cloverfield'. It's actually pretty simple: this one isn't a direct sequel (it's not like it picks right up where 'Cloverfield' left off or anything like that), but it does take place in the same 'universe', if you will, of that original film. Kind of an anthology sort of thing, where different stories can be told in the context of one over-arching narrative. While completely different in style from 'Cloverfield', this '10 Cloverfield Lane' is just as compelling in telling a unique story.Overall, I was thoroughly engaged by '10 Cloverfield Lane' from the opening credits to the closing ones. I hope that more films in the future can follow this type of approach and take a more cagey approach to marketing. Sure, this film has great acting, atmosphere, and story, but it really 'works' because of that sheer power of the mystery. Since you don't know what will happen, the film-making is given free reign to toy with your emotions, making for a powerful cinematic experience.",10,2,2,25 February 2017
3:10 to Yuma," Interesting Themes, But Very Sparse Acting
","In the old heyday of Western films, the 1960s, the genre was categorized by the panache of John Wayne, who came into town with his six-shooters blazing and cleaned up one town after another of evil-doers. Lately, however, with the Western genre on the very fringe of Hollywood, directors tackling this specific art form have taken a different approach. Instead of the 'Duke model', the focus is shifted towards the gritty realism of the time period.This film continues that realism tradition. When Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a salt-of-the-Earth sharecropper just trying to eek out a decent living for his family, volunteers his services to make sure the seedy criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) catches the 3:10 train to Yuma, the journey turns out to reveal much more about each character. While Evans struggles to uphold the law at all times and still keep some semblance of his manhood, Wade begins to realize that perhaps Ben is fighting for the nobler cause. These themes are slowly and carefully explored over the course of the film, and by and large are very interesting.However, the lack of great acting (or, more specifically, the lack of opportunities for great acting to shine) really bogs this movie down. I know that Bale and Crowe are top-notch actors, but they really aren't given a chance to take center stage. Bale's character is nearly silent the entire film, while Crowe has a few great moments but ultimately isn't fleshed out enough to truly believe/understand the film's conclusion. Only Logan Lerman, playing the part of Dan Evans' son William, truly shines in his role.Thus, while the themes in the film are rather interesting, the action backing them up is extremely lacking. If you are a fan of the new 'minimalist' Western genre, I would suggest Robert Duvall's 'Broken Trail' over this film, as you will find it much easier to understand the issues that men in the Old West faced.",6,1,2,12 March 2017
The Equalizer," Denzel Is Back!
","Over the past couple of years, Denzel Washington went from Hollywood A-lister to serious disappointment. 'Safe House' was a disaster, 'Flight' was okay at best, and movies like 'Pelham 123', 'Unstoppable' and '2 Guns' are a dime a dozen. Where was the Denzel from the mid- 2000s, where films like 'Deja Vu' and 'Man on Fire' showcased him at his best? I almost didn't even go see 'The Equalizer' because I was so afraid of another disappointment. Luckily, while not perfect by any means, this film shows that Denzel does still have greatness in him.For a basic plot summary, 'The Equalizer' tells the story of Robert McCall (Washington), a genial man who works at a home repair retail store. While warm, genial, and helpful at work, Robert's home life paints a different picture. He lives alone, a slave to routine and very little joy, and frequents a late-night dinner due to insomnia. At that diner, Robert strikes up some casual conversations with Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young prostitute, and gets to know her on a more personal level. One night, Teri shows up with bruises covering her face. The next night, she doesn't show up at all. This leads Robert (who obviously has a very violent past) to do what needs to be down to find her abusers.'The Equalizer' could almost be a sequel to 'Man on Fire' in terms of acting and intensity. Denzel plays a very similar role (very much based on vengeance) and shows with ease that he can still be 'the tough guy' when needed. What truly makes the movie great, though, is that director Antoine Fuqua (who also directed Denzel's breakout hit 'Training Day') knows how to utilize the great actor to his furthest potential. The first half of the film is set up so well that even a paint-by-numbers second half is forgivable because viewers are already snagged hook, line, and sinker.That being said, this isn't a five-star, all-time effort for a couple of different reasons. It becomes a bit predictable and over-the-top in the second half. Whereas 'Man on Fire' was able to sustain both the intensity and emotional energy for the entire runtime, this film drops the emotional stuff in favor of sheer brutality at times. Remember those scenes from 'First Blood', where Sly Stallone's John Rambo sets forest traps for the police officers hunting him? Well, a similar scenario plays out in this one...only involving home-improvement equipment in a retail store! I would have preferred a bit more emotion and character development (specifically more about McCall himself) in the movie's second act, but it doesn't fall completely flat because the 'bad guys' are such scum-bags that you don't mind the gruesome violence.Thus, despite its obvious flaws, 'The Equalizer' is more than good enough to vault Denzel back into the spotlight that an A-list career like his deserves. A quote from the film has McCall telling another character 'you got to be who you are in this world...no matter what'. After a number of misfires, Denzel gets back to 'who he is' with this exciting, bombastic film. Not his best, but puts him on the right track again.",7,2,4,28 February 2017
Ali," I Want This Movie To Be So Much Better Than It Is
","The life of Muhammad Ali (both inside and outside the ring) is one of the most fascinating in all of sports or US history. At times, this movie captures those moments. Sadly, it doesn't catch nearly enough of them, focuses on the wrong things, and ends up a bloated, ponderous exercise in preachy film-making.For a basic plot summary, 'Ali' opens with Cassius Clay (Will Smith) defeating Sonny Liston (Michael Bentt) to become the boxing heavyweight champion of the world. Shortly after this event, Clay falls in the Muslim Brotherhood, befriending such figures as Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) & Herbert Muhammad (Barry Shabaka Henley). He also begins a romantic relationship with Sonji Roi (Jada Pinkett Smith) that is often tumultuous due to Ali's interpretations of the Muslim faith. Entering the prime of his fighting career, Ali is then drafted into the Vietnam War, which he refuses to participate in. As a result, he is stripped of his boxing license and not even able to leave the country. After years of fighting the U.S. government, Ali is finally able to be reinstated, where he gets the 'Fight of the Century' with Joe Frazier (James Toney) and then the 'Rumble In The Jungle' against George Foreman (Charles Shufford).Judged purely on film-making and directing, 'Ali' isn't even a three-star effort. It is overly preachy when it comes to the 'political stuff', and director Michael Mann uses such a weird style. About every 20 minutes or so, there is an extended musical sequence, all of which (besides maybe the opening one) only serve to grind the intensity of the film to a complete halt. Every time the action starts to progress again...it's back to another strange interlude.There are two other problems with the film that are quite glaring:1. There is nothing (at least in terms of style) that director Mann really gets right during the film. The political side of things is definitely important to the Ali story, but in this case it is preachy and over-the-top. Then, when it comes to the boxing fare, there are too many historical inaccuracies to consider even those scenes a true success. Maybe those who know nothing about Ali won't care, but those who have a little background will be appalled to hearing Ali's famous poem used before the Frazier fight instead of Liston, or seeing Ali & Frazier getting buddy-buddy with each other before their fight (in reality, Frazier couldn't stand Ali until very late in his life when some amends were made).2. For a movie titled 'Ali', this should have focused on the entirety of Ali's life. That would have made for a much better story. Ali had a very interesting childhood, and also had some genre- defining moments late in his life as well. Those areas weren't even sniffed in this adaptation, which is a shame, as the film instead to give so much valuable time to the political/religious side of things.I'm sure by now you are probably wondering why I can even give this film three stars. Well, the main reason is because Will Smith turns in perhaps the greatest acting performance I have ever seen...bar none. He IS Ali in this picture, plain and simple. The times (sadly rare as they are) where Smith is given the chance to rant and rave like Ali once did are easily the best parts of the film. His interactions with Howard Cosell (played by Jon Voight) are also special.Also, the fight scenes are probably the most well-done boxing action I've even seen in a film. The fights manage to be both dramatic and realistic at the same time, which is no easy task in such a violent (yet also very tactical) sport.Overall, though, 'Ali' is first and foremost a disappointment. Even a three-star rating probably holds some personal bias of how much I simply WANT the film to be better than it is. While Smith's iconic Ali performance will certainly stand for ages, it's sad that it has to be surrounded by such sloppy film-making. I would suggest 'When We Were Kings' or 'Facing Ali' for a much better nod to Ali's unique career and culture-defining role in American society.",4,4,7,2 March 2017
The Expendables 2," Lighter Tone = Better Overall Experience
","The first 'Expendables' film was a 'tale of two halves': The first half is a jovial get-together of some of the greatest on-screen action heroes of all-time. However, after a rather strange speech by Mickey Rourke, the film turns really serious and loses much of its built-up energy. In the case of 'Expendables 2', however, the wise-cracking 'buddy' formula is in place all the way through and it makes it much easier to enjoy from start to finish.For a basic plot summary, 'Expendables 2' brings the old gang of Stallone, Statham, Li, Crews, Lundgren, & Couture back into a caper involving stolen plutonium. This time, however, the group is joined by Liam Hemsworth and Nan Yu. Along the way, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger stop in to beef up their roles from the original, while legendary action icons such as Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme also have important roles. A lot of bullets are expended, a lot of things explode, and a lot of biceps are strained.Noticed how I didn't mention any actual character names above? That is exactly by design, as in this film franchise all the actors are essentially playing caricatures of themselves (or at least of their former on-screen personas). That is actually what makes the formula work so well, as back in the 80s all these guys were 'competing' with each other, and now they are all on screen together! The one-liners and male camaraderie are almost worth the price of admission alone.Why 'just' three stars as a rating, then? Well, depending on your taste in movies, you may like this one a lot more or a lot less. I'm not a huge fan of pure-action flicks, but at the same time I loved seeing 'the old gang' get together, so I could enjoy this one (if not at 4 or 5-star levels). If explosions and gunfire are your cup of tea, however, then this one will jump a star or perhaps even two.Overall, 'Expendables 2' is a step up from the original that uses a looser, more comedic tone to keep audience interest. Though not personally a huge fan of 'action extravaganzas', I will come back for 'EX 3' if it is made.",6,1,1,8 March 2017
Source Code," Keeps You Engaged, But Doesn't Rise Any Higher
","'Source Code' is a solid movie that will keep you engaged from beginning to end. It has good acting, an interesting premise, and a plot that takes the entire running time to develop and thus makes you want to keep watching. However, the film fails to rise to sci-fi classic status due to a failure to develop anything other than that interesting plot.For a basic plot summary, 'Source Code' follows the strange occurrences of Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), a military soldier involved in a top-secret time-travel experiment. Without saying any more and risk ruining the overall plot, suffice it to say that Stevens' primary mission is to stop an act of terrorism involving a bomb on a passenger train...no matter how many times it takes for him to get things right.The high points of this movie are the acting and the basic time-travel premise. Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan turn in fine performances, as does Vera Farmiga as a conflicted military leader. The plot is also catchy, taking from previous sci-fi material found in Star Trek TNG (Picard stopping the Enterprise from blowing up) and The X-Files (Mulder trying to stop the bank from exploding).Unfortunately, though, there is not a whole lot else in this movie to draw you in. While the acting is indeed above average, the scripted characters and their interactions are nothing to write home about. The main romantic duo that is supposed to carry the emotional base of the film just doesn't deliver the payoff in the end.Also, there comes a certain point in this movie where you find yourself watching just because you want to figure everything out (after the main climax has come to a close). But (*SPOILER ALERT*): This is one of those movies that leaves the enduing up to your interpretation. Some people like that, while others don't. I guess I fall into the latter camp. There's just so much left up to us as viewers to put into place that I would have preferred a bit more scripted closure.Thus, while this isn't an outright classic in my mind, it will at least entertain you for the 90+ minute duration, which is more than I can say for most movies these days. Rent it cheaply somewhere, but you really don't need to own this one.",6,1,1,10 March 2017
Skyfall," Time To Go Back To 'Formula' (Ironically Enough)
","There is no denying that 'Casino Royale' and, albeit to a lesser extent, 'Quantum of Solace', did a remarkable job of breathing new life into a Bond franchise that had become too over-the-top at the tail end of the Brosnan years. Yet, in the case of 'Skyfall', the franchise actually goes too far in the OTHER direction (e.g. too gritty, too 'real', if you will). This is what prevents the movie from being a true Bond Classic (or really even close).For a basic plot summary, 'Skyfall' sees an aging Bond (Daniel Craig) once again taking orders from M (Judi Dench), this time trying to bring down cyber-terrorist Silva (Javier Bardem) before he can completely cripple MI6.There are two glaring problems that haunt this film (one 'macro', one 'micro'):1. The 'big picture' problem is that director Sam Mendes doesn't seem to have a clue how to place 'Skyfall' in the Bond canon. SPOILERS AHEAD: At first, viewers will think that this is the latest Bond film after Die Another Day, as the main theme of the movie deals with Bond getting older. Yet, as the movie goes along, one begins to doubt (what with a young 'Q' and an MI6 setup remarkably like the Connery years) if this isn't still treading prequel territory. I think this is suppose to be more of a 'reboot', of sorts, but it just doesn't make a whole ton of sense. You either need to have continuity in a film series, or you need to reboot it completely...there can't be a large amount of overlap.2. The 'little stuff' trouble, then, is that the 'Does the world need James Bond anymore?' storyline is a complete flop (and that is what is supposed to be the main emotional backbone of the movie). Again, director Mendes tries to take the franchise too far into 'Dark Knight' territory here, when in fact that Bond character is not meant to be done in such a fashion. It worked once in 'Casino Royale', but this is not a place (e.g. dark themes) in which this franchise can consistently succeed.Overall, then, I was severely disappointed by 'Skyfall'. I hope that the next two Craig Bond efforts go back to the more traditional Bond formula (gadgets, girls, & fun) without falling into the 'over-the-top' trap that ultimately slayed the Bond runs of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan. Bond is all about balance, and the scales need to be tipped a little bit away from the 'dark side' once again.",3,4,7,8 March 2017
50 First Dates," Sandler's First Foray Into Romance (With Chaotic Results)
","In his earlier efforts, Adam Sandler was known for his goofy comedy in movies such as 'Happy Gilmore', 'Billy Madison', and even 'The Waterboy'. With '50 First Dates', however, Sandler tries to add a bit of emotion into his juvenile sense of comedy. The result is closer to chaos than consistency.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Hawaii-based ladies man Henry Roth (Sandler) living the bachelor life by churning through one woman after the other. When he meets Lucy Whitmore (Drew Barrymore), however, everything changes for Henry. The reason? Due to short-term memory loss, Lucy relives the same day over and over again, never remembering the events of the previous 24 hours. Thus, Henry must decide whether to take advantage of this situation, or help Lucy live a happier life.The trouble with this movie is that Sandler's crude sense of humor does not mesh well with the more heartfelt tone of the overall picture. It is almost as if two movies are going on at the same time...one where Sandler cracks sexual jokes with his buds (of which again include Rob Schneider), and one where Sandler interacts on a more personal level with Barrymore.It would have taken a great directorial effort to make this juxtaposition work, but unfortunately Peter Segal just wasn't up to the task in this case. The movie actually needed to focus a bit more on the 'serious' stuff and leave off some of the crudeness. Had that happened, it would have worked much better due to the intriguing 'memory-loss' concept.Thus, I was solidly underwhelmed by '50 First Dates'. It isn't unwatchable, but it really can only succeed as an adolescent 'date movie' for those new to Sandler's comedic persuasions. It may make you think/feel on a deep level for a second or two, but those moments are quickly abandoned for another crude joke or sight gag.",4,4,7,3 March 2017
Catch Me If You Can," An Entertaining Period Piece Based On A True Story
","Usually, movies of this day and age are separated into two distinct classes. There are those that 'make you think', and then those at which you just 'sit back and enjoy the show'. 'Catch Me If You Can' manages to combine a little bit of both of those strategies in order to create an excellent little period piece that will almost completely absorb you into all its little nooks and crannies.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Frank Abagnale Jr (Leonardo DiCaprio), who at the age of 17 breaks away from his divorcing parents (played by Christopher Walken & Nathalie Baye) and becomes a sort of grand impersonator. By specializing in forging checks and projecting the utmost of confidence, Frank becomes an airline co-pilot, a doctor, & and lawyer during the 1960s...without the credentials for any of those positions! While defrauding multiple institutions as well as the U.S. government, Frank is pursued by agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who is continually astounded by the kinds of things that the young Abagnale is able to get away with.There are three primary ways in which this film becomes very much a classic upon first viewing...First, it is an incredible 'period piece' dealing with the 1969s. The clothes, decor, attitudes, music, & personalities of the decade are very convincing and will make you feel as if you were actually transported back in time.Second, the story is engrossing, compelling, and will have you thinking about its multiple themes the whole way through. Frank Jr. is not just a cardboard-cutout character...he is given the same contradictions that we all have, both good and bad.Finally, the acting is tremendous. DiCaprio steals the show pretty much from beginning to end, while Hanks is his typical solid self. Smaller roles from Walken & Amy Adams are also very interesting and well-played.Overall, 'Catch Me If You Can' is a fun little romp through the 1960s that (per the usual with a Steven Spielberg production) is very well-rounded and contains something for everybody. My exact rating would be 4.5 stars, as it truly will transport you away from the world for the entire runtime.",8,1,3,7 March 2017
The Ring," Bringing Japanese Horror Stateside
","Here in the United States, our horror movie culture is defined by mask-wearing, knife-wielding psychos like Michael Myers and Jason Vorhees. Over in Japan, though, their horror is much more dark and symbolic. 'The Ring' (an adaptation of the Japanese 'Ringu') brings that cinematic style over here.For a basic plot summary, 'The Ring' introduces a video tape that, when watched, will result in the viewer getting a phone call telling them they will die in seven days...which is usually exactly what happens. However, when the tape is seen by a journalist (Naomi Watts) and inadvertently by her son, they become engaged in a race against the clock to try and decipher the tape's mysterious imagery and the real story behind the ring.The dark, disturbing imagery in this film is really what makes it a horror stand-out. Since we are accustomed to more in-your-face scare scenes, this oblique style proves to be even more terrifying. The young girl with the straight hair over her eyes, the well, the dead horses, and the horrifying faces of the tape's victims all add up to a cornucopia of disturbing images.'The Ring' is also an exercise in the cerebral. Not all the answers are given up front or thrown in the viewers' face. Instead, we are forced to evaluate all the imagery and subtle clues to piece things together. To paraphrase Hitchcock, what we don't know/see is often scarier than the obvious.Overall, I consider 'The Ring' to be a seminal horror film for fans of the genre (right up there with Halloween and Saw). Given the chance, I would have bumped the star-rating up to 4.5.",8,1,1,12 March 2017
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Standard For Action/Adventure
","I've probably seen 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark' as many times as any other movie I've ever watched in my life. Each year or two from age 12 or so now to age 31, I've sat down and enjoyed this film. The amazing thing about it? It never seems to get old!For a basic plot summary, 'Raiders' sees archaeology professor Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) getting a tip that the Nazis are digging at the supposed place of the long-lost Ark of the Covenant. Armed with his trusty whip, adventurer's cap, leather jacket, and journal of clues, Indy rushes to Cairo for perhaps the greatest 'find' of his life. Along the way, he meets up with old flame Marion (Karen Allen), as well as getting himself both in and out of numerous dramatic scrapes.Almost without a doubt, 'Raiders' set the standard to which action/adventure movies are now held. The music is eternal, the scale is large, and the action is always moving ahead despite still being able to support interesting characters/dialogue. Only helping matters is the fact that Ford is perfectly cast as Indy, creating what is at least in the conversation for most iconic film role of all-time. From the very first time you see Indy, you know that this guy is an adventurer through and through. It's tough to have such a visceral connection to a character without any background, but director Steven Spielberg makes it seem effortless.I could go on and on about why 'Raiders' is such a great film (both technically and culturally), but I'll suffice it to say that some 36 years after its initial theatrical release it still remains not only a classic in the 'stuffy' sense, but also a movie that new viewers of today can appreciate just as much. People 36 years from now will be saying the same things...I'm sure of it!",9,1,2,25 February 2017
Deja Vu," What If You Could Solve A Crime BEFORE It Happens?
","Usually, police officers are only able to REACT to crimes and then investigation. However, what if one officer was given the opportunity to stop a crime BEFORE it could occur? That is the basic premise behind 'Deja Vu'.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with the tragic bombing of a ferry in New Orleans. When Agent Doug Carlin (Denzel Washington) is called in to investigate, he discovers that the bombing is somehow connected to Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). Via a team of secret scientists, Carlin is able to view a live video stream of the past in order to help him piece together the mystery of Ms. Kuchever.At its core, 'Deja Vu' is a very interesting (and fresh) take on time travel. More specifically, the ability to create a 'window to the past'. It is an intriguing concept from beginning to end, and one has to give much credit to director Tony Scott, who manages to seamlessly weave all the intricate pieces together (no easy task when dealing with relative physics!).Yet, thanks to a tight story and some incredible acting from Washington and Patton, this is also a very emotional and dramatic film. One cannot help but be sucked into the odd relationship between the two and wonder 'what would I do in a similar situation?'.Thus, I consider 'Deja Vu' to be one of the most well-rounded films a person could ever hope to find. It has action, adventure, drama, science fiction, and even that smug Denzel Washington humor that always plays so well. Unless you have very little imagination, this film will interest you on at least some level.",9,3,4,19 March 2013
It," Exceeded Even My High Expectations
","Stephen King's book 'It' is my single favorite fiction novel of all-time. I have read it a number of times and am completely and utterly absorbed by its atmosphere and characters. As such, despite the big buildup, promising trailers, and positive reviews, I wasn't sure that this new film adaptation could ever quite live up to my extremely heightened expectations. Fifteen minutes into my trip to the cinema, I knew I was wrong. This one was going to be great.For a basic plot summary, 'It' tells the story of the little Maine town of Derry, which seems to have a problem with children disappearing. During the time period this film focuses on, little Georgie Denbrough (Jackson Robert Scott) is attacked and killed by a maniacal clown named Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) in a sewer grate. That starts a pattern of child abductions (the cycle beginning again in Derry), which is seemingly only realized by the 'Losers Club', a group of friends who come together because they really don't fit in anywhere else:-Bill (Jaeden Lieberher), Georgie's older brother, is struggling to come to terms with the family tragedy, an event that afflicted him with a pronounced stutter. -Ben (Jeremy Ray Taylor), the 'fat kid' (pardon the judgment...this would have been me) of the group. -Richie (Finn Wolfhard), the loudmouth prankster. -Eddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), the sickly drink of water with the overbearing mother. -Mike (Chosen Jacobs), the black kid in a community not always accepting of minorities. -Stanley (Wyatt Oleff), the Jewish kid who struggles to even fit in with this gang. -Bev (Sophia Lillis), the girl that of course all the others have a huge crush on.Over the course of that summer, the Losers Club is tormented by neighborhood bully Henry Bowers (Nicholas Hamilton), while at the same time all seeing manifestations of 'It', a seemingly non-corporeal being who can transform into their greatest fears (e.g. Pennywise the maniacal clown).Director Andy Muschietti's 'It' is by no means a direct adaptation of the book. The best ones aren't, as they are two completely different mediums. Some of the characters go in different directions, some events are slightly altered, and even the time frame (1950s in the book) is moved up to the 1980s here.What doesn't change, however, is the spirit of the source material. King's novel is all about coming of age, facing fears, and having courage when no one else will. All of those things are perfectly present here. A lot of that has to do with the acting performances, starting with the camaraderie between the young child actors. This may be the best child-led ensemble cast I've ever seen on the big screen, as their antics provide some much-needed levity for material that can be very dark. Then, of course, there is Skarsgard's Pennywise, which is just as iconic as Tim Curry's earlier take on the role (this one being much more dark and violent).A final interesting observation is how 'It' so seamlessly melded together the horror, adventure, and thriller genres. If you are a fan of either, you'll find something to enjoy. The scary scenes are something straight out of, say, 'The Conjuring', while the buddy adventure is so much like 'Stranger Things' (Wolfhard double dipping even!) that one could almost call 'copycat' (but it's so fun who cares?!). Backing everything up is a very solid story.Of course, this is only the first chapter in the 'It' story, as King's book also goes into great detail about these characters as adults. That material is saved for a later-date sequel, and this one sets it up perfectly. This original can be viewed as a stand-alone experience, yet leaves just enough unanswered questions to make a compelling 'part two'.Overall, 'It' was one of my favorite film-going experiences in quite some time. It did justice to a great story, even introduced some new aspects into the mix, and whetted appetites for more to come. I can't wait to return to Derry for Round Two in the future!",10,10,18,16 September 2017
Hereditary," Creepy Images Are Never Enough On Their Own
","One thing I've learned about horror/suspense flicks over the years is that creepy images alone are not enough to base the entire experience around. Sure, you can load a film with jump-scares and grisly images, but if there isn't an interesting or coherent plot to back it up, the entire experience will be transient (at best) and utterly forgettable (at worst). Unfortunately, the latter is very close to my feelings about 'Hereditary'.For a basic plot summary, this film begins with a family that is reeling from the death of the grandmother matriarch. Mother Annie (Toni Collette) doesn't quite know how to process her emotions, husband Steve (Gabriel Byrne) just seems distant, while siblings Charlie (Milly Shapiro) & Peter (Alex Wolff) start displaying signs of odd behavior. When another tragedy rocks the family, the oddness quotient increases, leading Annie to take drastic measures to get to the bottom of what is actually transpiring.It's actually pretty easy for me to pinpoint exactly why I disliked this film so much: About halfway in, I knew it would 'all come down to the ending', so to speak. Because not much time is devoted to really digging deep into the characters, this quickly turns into the type of movie that will be defined by what twist it can pull out of the bag before the credits roll. Sadly, that ends up being the weakest part of the film, essentially dooming the entire experience.I don't want to spoil the film for anyone, but I will just say this: you won't expect what happens in the end, but that doesn't turn out to be a good thing. It really feels like 'Hereditary' had some forward momentum, and then only was able to tack on a mumbo-jumbo sort of ending to all of it. For 3/4 of the film, it teases viewers into thinking that 'all the clues are there...you just have to put them together'. That is most definitely NOT the case, as the ending is instead pulled so far out of left field that it might as well not even be in the ballpark.To be sure, there are some creepy images and jump-scares in 'Hereditary', and that is the only reason I can even give it three stars here (it does put in some semblance of effort). Without a strong plot, and sunk by an even worse concept ending, though, it doesn't make a mark in any significant way.",3,10,21,10 June 2018
Minority Report," A Concept Film That Also Wows With Action
","Imagine if you could be charged & arrested for a crime you were ABOUT to commit? That is the premise behind Steven Spielberg's 'Minority Report'.For a basic plot summary, the film (set in the future) focuses on John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the highly successful 'Pre-Crime' unit, which (with help from three special pre- cognizants) are able to predict a murder BEFORE it occurs, rendering the crime rate almost nil. However, Anderton suddenly finds himself the target of a pre-crime investigation, and embarks on a crusade to prove his innocence...which in itself is in doubt until the shocking conclusion.In terms of plot, the film excellently delivers a high-concept topic in a way that both creates high drama and gets you thinking about the possibility of such events actually occurring. At its heart, 'Minority Report' is a concept film, but one in which the events are portrayed (thanks to Spielberg) in such a linear, easy-to-understand manner that it actually feels like an action- adventure epic.The acting, with Cruise leading the way, is also entertaining, as Cruise plays a very convoluted Anderton. On one hand, he believes in the PreCrime system with all his heart. On the other, he grapples with the fact that he himself could be a casualty of that very system.About the only thing I didn't like about this film were some of the extended action scenes. While flashy, in terms of real-ness they were much more suited for, say, a James Bond film. In other words, a bit too fakey for my tastes.Overall, this is a great concept film that will keep you thinking, draw you into the characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat. Creatively, I compare it to Blade Runner, although much better in terms of the action/adventure angle, whereas Blade Runner seems so bleak.",7,1,1,11 March 2017
Finding Neverland," The Magic Of 'Pan'
","The magic of the 'Peter Pan universe' is something that most children experience at some time in their lives. The thrill of staying young forever, flying away to distant lands, and battling pirates is one that can easily capture the imagination of the young. 'Finding Neverland' is the story of how James Barrie created that magical universe that has stood the test of time.For a basic plot summary, 'Finding Neverland' sees struggling playwright James Barrie (Johnny Depp) introduced to Sylvia Davies (Kate Winslet), a widow with four young children, on a chance encounter at a local park. While forming a bond with Sylvia and especially her playful children, Barrie begins to realize the power of 'play' and 'imagination' and begins to incorporate those elements into a new play about a boy who never grows up.This film is very successful on two different levels:1. The backstory on Barrie/Davies is very interesting. I knew nothing about it going in, so I can't speak to the accuracy of all the events depicted, but it sure seems as if Barrie was truly inspired by the Davies children.2. For fans of the Peter Pan narrative, seeing the story come together bit by bit is a visual and emotional treat. It is kind of strange to think of the Pan story as anything but pure childhood escapism fiction, but this movie shows us how it was quite real to the actors, theater-goers, and producers of the day.Only helping matters is the solid acting by Depp and Winslet, who are both so 'classically trained' in acting (I believe they have both done much theater) that their casting is perfect in this period piece.Overall, then, 'Finding Neverland' is a fun, informative film for fans of the Peter Pan cannon. It will bring out your emotions, humor, and sense of history while viewing.",9,1,1,3 March 2017
If I Stay," Seems A Bit Gimmicky
","After loving the roles that Chloe Grace Moretz played in 'Carrie' & 'The Equalizer', I decided to give this one a shot after recently having watched (and enjoyed more than I thought) a similar teen drama in 'The Fault In Our Stars'. Unfortunately, I felt that this one was kind of based on a gimmick.For a basic plot summary, 'If I Stay' tells the story of Mia (Moretz), a high school girl who plays a beautiful cello. This musical talent gets her noticed by cute guy Adam (Jamie Blackley) and she is awaiting a letter from Juilliard's music program. On a seemingly normal family drive, however, Mia is involved in a car crash putting the entire family in the hospital. As 'physical Mia' fights for her life in the hospital, 'spirit Mia' watches the action unfold as a kind of ghost entity, trying to discover what is happening to her and her family members. Many moments of the previous year are flashed-back to as Mia discovers what is really important in her life.The main problem with this film is that it seems to be based on what I consider to be a very gimmicky concept, that being 'spirit Mia' watching herself (and her family) in the hospital interspersed with flashbacks. What purpose did that serve in the film besides to give Moretz more time to act? It all could have been done with Mia just laying in her hospital bed. All that would have been missed was a few reaction shots.Couple that with the fact that the story here didn't strike me as particularly strong to begin with. Maybe if one appreciates cello music more than I do, or is a sucker for sad movies, they will find more significance here, but I never felt that what I was watching made the jump from 'contrived' to 'real'.The highlights? Moretz is still great in her role (as convoluted as it may be sometimes), while a grandfather character (played by Stacy Keach) practically steals the show with ever scene he is in. In a movie that should be filled with such emotion, it is telling that a guy on the screen in a very limited role has such an impact.Thus, while I know I shouldn't directly compare this to 'Fault In Our Stars', it just so happens that I saw both within about a two-week span. 'Fault' made me actually care about what was going on and drew me in. 'Stay'...not so much. At times I even got a little bored waiting for something to happen. Like I said, Chloe Grace Moretz is still solid, but it isn't enough to inject life into this vehicle.",4,1,2,26 February 2017
Lifeboat," Hitchcock's Character Study
","Though many of Alfred Hitchcock's films are extraordinary at developing characters, that development often plays second-fiddle to suspense, drama, & even subtle comedy. In 'Lifeboat', however, the characters are on center stage throughout the entire experience, with Hitchcock masterful crafting them one by one...until the ending, of course.For a basic plot summary, 'Lifeboat' tells the story of a group of Americans trapped on a lifeboat after the Nazi bombing of a freighter. When a German U-boat captain is pulled aboard and portends to know the direction they should be sailing, the characters must decide whether or not to trust the enemy captain. Along the way, all the personality types and individual prejudices are the survivors are explored.In terms of a character treatise, this is an excellent film...one of Hitch's very best. I am a big fan of 'bunch of people trapped in a situation' movies, so I was instantly drawn to this type of movie and was not let down. Though Hitch usually deals with personal/political topics in a very off- hand, tongue-in-cheek sort of way, he really seems to delve into them with much more gusto in 'Lifeboat'. Upon reaching the end, you'll feel as if you truly care about the characters and their motives/personalities.The acting is also top-notch, with a case of seasoned veterans like Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Walter Slezak, John Hodiak, and Henry Hull, among others. In films of this nature (think: 12 Angry Men, for instance) the acting must be spot-in in order to generate emotion, as very few outside factors can be utilized.Minor Spoiler: Sadly, the glaring weakness of this movie (and what keeps it from being a true classic) is its horrible ending. Hitchcock has a long history of sub-par endings, but this one might be the 'cream of the crop' in terms of ridiculousness. For a film screaming for character resolution, this one gives you NOTHING. It literally just ends. Perhaps that was acceptable back in the 1940s, but today it is unforgivable.Overall, though, 'Lifeboat' is a very interesting character study that is easily worthy of four- stars. Had it offered a bit of resolution, this could have rocketed to the top of Hitchcock's filmography. As it is, it's just a solid effort that fails in one key area.",7,1,1,10 March 2017
Detroit," Curiously Lacking A Clear Focus
","When I started seeing promotional material for 'Detroit', I thought that it really had the chance to be something special. It is very timely in today's social/political climate, and director Kathryn Bigelow always takes such care in her films to portray the truth. While this seems to indeed be the case in 'Detroit' as well, the film comes off as lacking a clear focus in terms of what it wanted to accomplish short of 'showing the facts of what happened'.For a basic plot summary, 'Detroit' tells the story of the 1967 race riots that tore through the city of Detroit, MI. While the first half of the film looks at the riots as a whole, the second half focuses in on one specific incident where the Detroit PD roughs up a group of African American men (and two white women) in trying to find a weapon that was fired from that location. The shocking brutality and subsequent trial are all chronicled in the back half of the film.There are two things that I really wish 'Detroit' would have done different:1. It almost seems to be two different movies, and I wish Bigelow would have stuck to the first one, so to speak. As I've mentioned, the first half is really gripping, showing the beginning of the riots and what they might mean for everyone. I was really 'into' this movie, as it truly does parallel many similar themes and problems even today. When the film switches to the one Algiers Motel incident, however, I felt like it bogged down and never really recovered. Perhaps had the film focused on that single scene from the beginning it would not have been so jarring of a switch, but as it stands I didn't like the focus going from wide-angle to pretty strict zoom.2. I know that Bigelow likely wants to remain a-political in her filmmaking (from what I remember, a similar thing happened in 'The Hurt Locker'), but I also feel like this isn't a story that can be told without taking a bit of a stand. That doesn't happen here, though, and the movie has less of an impact because of it. Instead, this is very much a 'just the facts, ma'm' approach that, at nearly two and a half hours, becomes hard to get through.There is enough in 'Detroit' to make it a watchable movie, as the acting performances are great and the general atmosphere of the whole piece is pretty chilling. Plus, Bigelow does a great job of subtly showing how similar race issues continue to plague black/police relationships. Basically, it does a great job of showing how the problems often remain even after the actors change.So, while not a bad movie by any stretch, 'Detroit' is one that I was quite underwhelmed by. I wanted a more consistent storytelling approach and a bit more of an impactful, articulated message within it. It's worth a watch if you are interested in the type of topics it delves into, but it likely won't vault to the top of your best-of lists.",6,2,5,16 April 2018
Rocketman," All About The Music And That Works Here!
","When I think of biopics, especially about musicians, I think of films like 'Walk The Line' or 'Love & Mercy' that told pretty much straight biography stories and then interspersed the artist's music at certain points. That is not the approach taken in 'Rocketman'. No, this one is all about the music, and because it's the legendary Elton John, it works basically as well as anything.For a basic overview, this film tells the story of Sir Elton, both as a young Reginald Dwight (Matthew Illesley) and the uber-star he would later grow into (Taron Egerton). Many of his now-infamous tunes are covered in song-and-dance numbers, all painting a narrative of his struggle to make it in the music business, come to terms with his sexuality, and deal with drug & alcohol problems.If you want a basic idea of how 'Rocketman' unfolds, think of a movie like 'La La Land', where it's basically a straight drama that routinely transitions into elaborate song. In this case, though, it could almost be better described as a musical about John that is interspersed with a little bit of bio. If I had list this under a genre, it would be 'Musical' and not 'Drama' or 'Biography'. Normally, I have a feeling that this approach might not work for many audiences, but in the case of Elton John his songs are so iconic and cut through the generations that I feel the film-makers make the appropriate choice in putting the music front and center.The bio material is still present, but in all honesty it plays out in pretty much cookie-cutter fashion, including the standard points of parental arguments, manager feuds, substance abuse, and reclamation attempts in the end. Whether this is because that's literally how Elton's life went or because the film-makers needed that sort of drama I am not sure, but fortunately those scenes are not the heart of the movie.No, what you'll mainly take away from this experience is some amazingly-produced numbers of many of John's greatest hits (he had so many they couldn't all even be included!). I can almost guarantee that before you are practically even out of the theater, you'll be browsing your music subscription of choice for Elton John playlists.All in all, I enjoyed 'Rocketman' even more than I thought I would. I was worried that the unconventional approach would turn me off, but it ended up being the perfect choice instead. It may not be an incredibly deep-dive into the life of John, but it still hits all the necessary notes (pardon the pun) and provides some incredible musical numbers you won't soon forget.",8,4,6,24 June 2019
A Star Is Born," High Floor; Low Ceiling
","After watching this iteration of 'A Star Is Born' (I actually had not seen any of the others previously), there's no way I could give it a ranking lower than seven stars. It's too solid of a film, featuring so many great auxiliary things happening, to go any lower. At the same time, however, there's also really no way I would rank it higher than maybe eight stars, either. To me, this was one of those movie experiences where the floor is very high, but the ceiling is relatively low.For a basic plot summary, 'A Star Is Born' tells the romantic tale of Jack (Bradley Cooper) & Ally (Lady Gaga). Jack is an on-the-way-out music star with a drinking problem and a bad case of tinnitus, but when when he chances upon Ally working at a drag bar and is completely enraptured with her voice, the chemistry between the two is immediate. He needs her to keep him out of the bottle, while she needs him to stay true to herself and remember to be confident. The relationship is tested to the brink, however, when Ally's own burgeoning career takes her further and further away from Jack.Perhaps the most interesting part of this film experience for me was seeing Cooper (also the director) produce a very gritty, down-to-earth, 'now-feeling' flick using a concept ripped from the glitz-and-glamour dramas of Hollywood's Golden Era. Cooper takes this simple, relatively straightforward story and perfectly adapts it for these modern times. Jack & Ally are both characters that feel very relatable to the audience, the types one could find carrying on a similar romance even outside the cinema doors. This part of the equation is done perfectly.Part of the reason why I can't quite call this film a true 'great' (pulling the punch just a bit), though, is rooted in that very simplicity. I'm not going to say that every film's plot needs to be twisty or mysterious, but I will say this about 'A Star Is Born': I feel like it was more a labor of 'let's turn this old story into something updated/better' than anything. An emotional speech from Sam Elliott towards the end of the film really sums this up. While I respect that approach, it just isn't going to vault the movie into my film stratosphere. Hence, the 7/8 star rating is very much subjective to my own personal likings.I don't want to sell the movie short at all, though, because it does so many things right:-The music is indeed truly incredible. If you aren't listening to the soundtrack almost immediately after exiting your theater seat, you may not have a soul :)-The acting is also top-notch. Cooper's performance might be award-worthy, and Gaga is practically just playing herself (which works because she's such an interesting individual even off camera).-Never once did I find myself bored or disinterested while watching, as Cooper always infuses a sense of energy or forward motion into the proceedings. I also legitimately did not see the ending coming that was given to us.So, despite perhaps not ranking extraordinarily high on my 'Best-Of' lists, there are still a lot of things I will take away from this film, most notably the music and Cooper's performance. As I said in the opener, it's a little odd to see a film with this high a floor have such a potentially low ceiling in contrast.",7,8,14,11 October 2018
Gravity," Visuals Are Spectacular But The Plot/Characters Are Just...Okay
","Heading into the theater to see this movie, I thought that it was going to be a great experience. I had heard high praise from friends, it fits neatly into my favorite genre of movies (science fiction/drama), and it just looked like a really, really cool concept. Unfortunately, I left the theater feeling ambivalent.For a basic plot summary, 'Gravity' tells the story of two astronauts who are stranded in space after a freak satellite accident pummels their shuttle and sends them both adrift. Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is the cool, cocky, non-stop energy personality, while Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is the nervous, scared, out-of-her-element type. They must somehow find a way to survive in the vacuum of space while planning a return journey to Earth.I will say this about 'Gravity': the visuals are absolutely astonishing. It really makes you feel as if you are in space with the two astronauts. I didn't even see it in IMAX, but I can imagine that would be even a more visceral experience.The trouble for me, however, is that I felt that the plot/characters were never really developed enough to truly care when it all starts to come together in the end. It almost seemed as if director Alfonso Cuaron tried to tackle too many things at once and didn't really 'nail' any of them. There were shades of horror, suspense, drama, reality, and even humor sprinkled into the experience, but in the end I just didn't feel the emotion that is needed for such a character- driven film like this one to be considered great.Thus, aside from the spectacular visuals, I was disappointed with 'Gravity'. It isn't a 'bad' movie, per se, so three stars are in order, but 2.5 would be my more exact ranking. It just never sucked me into the plot or characters.",5,1,3,5 March 2017
Se7en," Could Have Beaten 'Saw' To The Punch
","In 2004, the movie 'Saw' vaulted to the top of many 'psychological thriller' lists via its gritty depiction of violence and insights into the criminal mind. Nearly ten years earlier, 'Se7en' covered similar material and, barring one slip-up, could have stolen Saw's thunder.For a basic plot summary, 'Se7en' focuses on a series of brutal crimes revolving around the seven deadly sins of religious lore. Investigators Mills (Brad Pitt) & Somerset (Morgan Freeman) are assigned to the case, each bringing a unique perspective (in keeping with their general film personas) to the strange murders. As they near the end of the case, the detectives discover that the man they are pursuing has ideas about human nature that, while sadistic, might just cut to the core of what makes us all fallible.There are two reasons why this movie works as well as it does...First, the overall storyline is just very well-crafted. Director David Fincher has proved time and time again that he knows how to construct a solid motion picture, and this one is no different. By the end of the movie, you'll be questioning your very beliefs on what you just saw, making this a very cerebral experience.Also, Fincher does not shy away from portraying the re-enactments of the seven deadly sins in their graphic detail. Some people would probably view this as overkill or gross-out film-making, but Fincher realized that it HAD to be this way for such a dark, gritty film to work.In terms of acting, Pitt & Freeman turn in their usual solid performances. The character arcs seemed a bit forced (Pitt as the 'eager rookie', Freeman as the 'grizzled vet'), but the physical acting itself (as well as the way it all comes together in the end) more than makes up for that.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars (and also the same reason why I can't say it is as good as Saw)? To me, the real 'meat' of the story is when the two detectives finally confront the villain (played to perfection by Kevin Spacey). Whereas in Saw, the 'Jigsaw' killer is given as much backstory & screen time as the protagonists, 'Se7en' only focuses on Spacey's character for the last portion of the film. Everything leading up the that is a procedural cop story (albeit a graphic & disturbing one).Thus, I consider 'Se7en' to be a groundbreaking effort in the psychological thriller department, paving the way for later efforts like 'Saw'. It isn't perfect, but it did (at least at the time) tread new ground. Unless you are overly squeamish, this movie will keep you engaged from its shocking beginning to its even more shocking finale!",7,2,3,10 March 2017
Unbreakable," Stretching The Boundaries Of Possibility
","In the canon of M. Night Shyamalan, movies like 'The Sixth Sense', 'Signs', and even 'Lady in the Water' (provided you view it with the right perspective) can be enjoyed again and again. 'Unbreakable' is a little different in that it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings. However, the first viewing will still provide a mind-bending experience worthy of M. Night.For a basic plot summary, 'Unbreakable' focuses on David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who walks away from a horrible train wreck as the only survivor...and without a scratch on him. After meeting with eccentric comic book dealer 'Mr. Glass' (Samuel L. Jackson), David begins to question whether or not that train wreck survival was a 'miracle' at all. When he discovers that he has never been sick that he can remember and that he possess certain prognosticative powers, he begins to wonder just who (or what) exactly he might be.This film is typical M. Night fare in that it weaves a great mystery and gets you thinking all the way through. It isn't a 'sit back and pop the popcorn' kind of flick. Instead, it thrives on the viewer using some mental effort and getting caught up in the seemingly impossible tale of David Dunn and Mr. Glass. As such, it might be a bit slow for some viewers, but if you like any of M. Night's other works (or even those type of movies) you'll have no trouble here.About the only bad thing I have to say about this film is that it is only truly remarkable on the first viewing. After that (unless you have a short memory!) it doesn't hold up quite as well to multiple viewings. The reason? This one is ALL about the mystery, lacking the strong auxiliary characters like 'Sixth Sense' or 'Signs'.Overall, 'Unbreakable' is a fine film that showcases the M. Night mysterious style of film- making. If you are in the mood for a great mind-bending mystery and haven't seen this one before, you are in for a treat.",8,1,2,4 March 2017
Star Trek," A Nearly Perfect Trek Re-Awakening
","Ever since the crew of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise signed off at the end of 'Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country', the film franchise had taken a nosedive. Besides 'First Contact', all the subsequent films only served to facilitate the demise of the franchise, with 'Nemesis' seemingly the final shovel-full of dirt into the coffin. With the 'Original Series' cast gone, the franchise (at least in terms of box office and TV ratings, not fanboys like me who will watch it regardless of popularity!) slowly died away.However, after young director J.J. Abrams began building a name for himself with such projects as 'Alias', 'LOST', and 'Cloverfield', he decided to tackle the challenge of making Star Trek relevant again to today's audiences. Abrams accomplished that goal with flying colors!Since the 'Original Series' characters are still (some 40+ years removed from their show) the heart of the Star Trek franchise (people don't flock to conventions to see Scott Bakula!), Abrams resurrects them in this film by showing them in their early years of space exploration. This proves to be the biggest success of the film, as nods to TOS abound throughout the movie. Since those are the characters we care the most about, we hang on the edge of our seats to see a young Captain Kirk get a little feisty, a young Spock raise that eyebrow, or a young Leonard 'Bones' McCoy utter his trademark grumbly phrases. Along with the time-period (pre-TOS) choice, the casting is also spot-on. On can easily imagine Chris Pine growing into the Kirk popularized by William Shatner, while Zachary Quinto also portrays a very believable Spock. Perhaps the most fun character in the film to watch, though, is Karl Urban as the cantankerous (even at a young age!) Bones. The actors playing the characters of Uhura, Scotty, Chekhov, and Sulu also turn in performances that easily harken back to their TOS predecessors. An appearance from old hand Leonard Nimoy (which turns out to be a lot more than just a cameo!) also fits right in to the flow of the film, not seeming forced or desperate.There is also a pace and energy to this movie that is relentless. Basically, all the beats happen perfectly, punctuated by a score that is perhaps the best I've ever heard in the cinema. One would think it would be more difficult to reboot what had become such a stodgy franchise, but JJ makes it look easy. I think the bottom line is that it made me remember why Star Trek stories can be so great.Overall, then, this Star Trek is critical to the franchise because it put Star Trek on the map again. It has all the 'old stuff', it has the energy of a contemporary flick, and the plot/characters are almost perfect. With the exception of 'Wrath of Khan', this may be the best Trek movie of them all.",9,3,5,11 March 2017
Fight Club," No Matter How Weird It Gets, Don't Bail Before The Conclusion!
","I am not usually a fan of 'weird' movies, and 'Fight Club' definitely qualifies under that distinction. I'm also not overly fond of movies that throw out sociological themes by the dozen just to 'see what sticks', which 'Fight Club' also does quite a bit of. Yet, in an exception to my personal 'rule', this movie is so incredibly well-made that it easily vaults onto my 'favorite movies ever' list.For a basic plot summary, 'Fight Club' sees a down-and-out business man (Edward Norton) who is completely burnt out emotional, to the point where he actually goes to support groups for diseases he does not have just so he can emote. One day, however, this man meets the mysterious Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who takes charge of his life and completely transforms his personality from utterly passive to overly aggressive. When things get out of hand, however, the pair are at odds over which way their future is headed.Minor Spoiler Alert: This is a movie with a 'twist' ending. As such, I won't really say anything more about the plot. Suffice it to say, though, that 'Fight Club' covers so much ground that it will feel like you've watched five movies in its time-span. If you have seen 'The Mechanic' with Christian Bale, this is a very similar experience.The hallmark of the whole 'Fight Club' experience, though, is how director David Fincher seamlessly weaves the movie's far-reaching plot themes into something coherent, surprising, & exciting. At no point in the experience will you feel as if you have this movie 'figured out'...but in this case that is a good thing! The film is so deep on a sociological, physical, and emotional level that you'll almost feel a little 'wiped off' from thought after viewing.The acting in 'Fight Club' also very much suits the overall 'weird' tone of the movie. Norton & Pitt provide a nice compliment to each other, while Helena Bonham Carter is interesting in a role that actually has much more significance to the film than one might originally perceive.Simply put, the first time I saw 'Fight Club' I was completely blown away by the whole concept. Years later, I watched it again (this time from the 'knowing' perspective) and was still blown away by its deep themes and interesting concepts. I could probably watch it again and still catch new things. So, no matter how weird this movie gets, please DO NOT bail out before the end, where everything finally comes together and begins to make a bit more sense. Fincher will not fail you if you stick with him!",10,1,4,9 March 2017
Darkest Hour," All About Oldman's Performance
","Historical biopics are usually a genre that is right up my alley, as I love seeing historical places/events/people come to life on the big screen. I can't say that 'Darkest Hour' is one of my favorites of the genre, but it does include an iconic performance from Gary Oldman (that I can say for sure).For a basic plot summary, 'Darkest Hour' tells the story of Winston Churchill's (Oldman) selection to become the Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1940, with Hitler's Germany having all but conquered the rest of Europe and now knocking on England's doorstep with a seemingly overwhelming force. Trapped between the appeasement talks that government officials want to pursue, and the hard-line stance he wishes to adopt, Churchill must somehow find the conviction to forge ahead and lead the country in one of it's truly darkest times.The big draw here is the stunning performance of Oldman as Churchill. I'll confess that I am not a great scholar of Sir Winston, but from what I do now this seems to be an accurate portrayal of the figure. Visually it is probably the most stunning, as Oldman is utterly unrecognizable from his days as, say, Commissioner Gordon in Nolan's Bat-trilogy or Sirius Black in Harry Potter. Every time Churchill's psyche is probed, that is when this film really, really 'works', as his internal struggle is what makes the whole thing tick.What I found to be lacking in the film, though, was a sense of something really new being accomplished in terms of plot. I know this is somewhat of an unfair burden to place on a film trying to be historically accurate, but I think the point still stands. In a year where Christopher Nolan released a film entirely devoted to the Dunkirk operation, those parts in this movie (which take up a decent chunk of time) seem dull by comparison. To be honest, I wish the film had focused more on Churchill's political leanings, as I thought that was where the really 'meaty' stuff resided in the film. Preaching 'war in the face of peace/settlement' (as Churchill did) is not a popular stance these days, and that is what (at times) really drew me into the narrative. I just wish that would have comprised more time.For me, then, I think the reason why I can't consider 'Darkest Hour' one of my favorite films is because it is set in a period (WWII) that has been 'done to death', so to speak. I'm not saying that it still isn't a worthy period to probe, but rather that it is difficult to stumble upon new material while doing so. As a result, from 'Darkest Hour' I mainly came away with Oldman's remarkable performance, as well as the thought of Churchill being pro-war when so many in his own government favored appeasement. That was easily enough to go no lower than 6/10 stars. The other four stars, however, were lost due to the fact that the other WWII fare in this film was pretty standard and never felt to me like it stood out from other materials I've seen before.",6,1,4,18 March 2018
The Rookie," It Could Have Settled, But Instead Achieved Greatness (Just Like Its Source Material)
","Being a Disney production, 'The Rookie' could easily have settled to become a weepy dramatic tale dripping with over-dramatized scenes. Luckily, thanks to great acting and an attention to detail, this movie is instead a great human drama focusing on baseball themes.For a basic plot summary, 'The Rookie' tells the true story of Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid), a 36- year old high school chemistry teacher in Texas. After a lifetime of being uprooted time and time again by his military father (Brian Cox), Morris also had his big-league baseball dream cut short by arm injuries. While coaching high school baseball in Texas and raising a family, he suddenly discovers that his left arm has some serious juice left in it. On a bet that inspires his young charges, Morris shows up at a MLB tryout and begins the journey he had thought was dormant forever.The reason this movie is so moving is because it weaves so many human-drama themes into the proceedings. Many potential viewers may dismiss it as a 'baseball movie', but to do so would be foolish. This is more truly a story of family and one man's journey to make peace with his life. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like a story like this. It is just so emotional as Morris interacts with his children, wife, parents, and others affiliated with the baseball side of his life.Only helping the drama spring to life is the incredible acting. I've seen Quaid in many movie roles, and this one is eclipsed by none of them. His body language and facial expressions carry the emotionally-charged scenes. The supporting cast around him (especially Rachel Griffiths and Angus Young as Morris' wife and son) also shines and really, truth be told, are very much more than 'supporting'. They are the reasons why Morris does what he does.Overall, I consider 'The Rookie' to be the epitome of a solid, wholesome family drama (and just an incredibly compelling story to boot). I'm a big baseball fan, so perhaps I can appreciate the deeper, more embedded themes of the film more than the non-sports viewer, but to me this is five-star material all the way.",9,1,1,5 March 2017
Memento," Almost Defies Explanation (A Film Told In Reverse)
","Every once in awhile, you watch a film so good, inventive, and original that it almost leaves you a bit stunned. That is exactly how I feel when I watch 'Memento', perhaps the most perfectly-crafted movie of all times in terms of screenplay and plotting.For a basic plot summary, 'Memento' tells the story of an amnesiac who cannot remember short-term events. He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day-to-day details reset from time to time. Thus, this film is devoted to him trying to avenge his wife's killing and putting together the pieces of his confusing identity.'Memento' is much deeper than that above description, but to say any more would give away the fun of figuring it all out. The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end. In what would prove to be a pattern for the Nolans going forward (especially projects in which Jonathan is attached too), the narrative does not play out in a linear format. Instead, it gives us little chunks in reverse order, so basically we see the ending first and then keep pulling back the curtain to understand the 'why' of it all. What a concept! It takes a perfect screenplay to pull that off, and the Nolans come through easily on that front. I can only imagine the time and effort it must have taken to tell a story in this manner.Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story. In other words, it is both very complicated and very fun to watch. I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey. Unlike other mind-benders such as, say, 'Primer' or 'Donnie Darko' (that revel in the confusion they are creating), 'Memento' accomplishes the rare feat of being equally entertaining and challenging.Thus, 'Memento' is now firmly ensconced on my 'Top Films of all-time' list, in large part because, 18 years after its debut, there still really isn't anything like it. There's a reason why the Nolans have become such large entities in Hollywood, and it all comes back to this groundbreaking film.",10,1,4,10 March 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," First 'Star Wars Story' A Rousing Success
","When the Star Wars franchise was turned over to Disney from George Lucas, many worried that it would be 'commodified' too much, to the point that their would be an over-saturation and dilution of the material. 'Rogue One', the first 'Star Wars Story' (not featuring the canon roman numerals or opening scrawl), would be the initial test to see how the material would be handled. By almost all accounts, it was a tremendous success!For a basic plot summary (only minor spoilers), 'Rogue One' tells the story of how the Rebel Alliance steals the plans for the Imperial Death Star weapon, which sets up the events of Episode IV: A New Hope. The film focuses on Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), daughter of the Galen Erso (Mads Mikkelsen) forced to work for the Empire on the Death Star itself. When of age to join the Rebel cause, Jyn meets the mysterious Saw Gerrera (Forest Whitaker) and then is sent on a dangerous mission with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). On the 'Dark Side' of things, Orson Krennic (Ben Mendelsohn) is tasked with making sure the Death Star is fully operational, overseen by Governor Tarkin (Guy Henry/CGI) and even Lord Vader himself.When coming into this movie experience, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. Suffice it to say, it pretty much blew away even those ambiguous expectations. It doesn't try to do too much, yet at the same time it isn't too sparse and thus is filled with call-backs or 'easter eggs' to 'A New Hope'. It really does find that perfect balance. One thing to be prepared for is a lot of material to be throw at you in the first 1/3 to 1/2 of the film. It jumps around to many different planets and puts a lot of balls in the air. To be honest, halfway through the film I was a bit worried that it was going to be 'just okay'. The final half or two-thirds, however, sees everything come together in a way that is just as impressive (both dramatically and visually) as any piece in the rest of the Star Wars canon.It's amazing to me how a single scene from 'A New Hope' (evaluating the stolen Death Star plans) could inspire an entire film, and I'm even more impressed that a really solid movie could be produced as a result! It would be very, very easy for Disney to start cranking these movies out (they are guaranteed money-makers right now) irregardless of quality, but fortunately the Mouse House seems (at least so far) to be taking the utmost care of the franchise. My brothers and I will be arguing for months over where to watch this movie in the grand scheme of things, and I consider perhaps the best compliment I can give a Star Wars film.",8,11,15,27 February 2017
Shakespeare in Love," If You Are Looking For Serious Shakespeare, You Need Not Apply
","After reading a piece of historical fiction regarding the life of William Shakespeare, I figured I would give this Academy Award-winning film a try while inspired. Unfortunately, what I found was very nearly a complete and utter mess of comedy trying to be mixed with serious themes.For a basic plot summary, 'Shakespeare in Love' weaves the tale of the creation of William Shakespeare's (Joseph Fiennes) 'Romeo & Juliet' with his strikingly similar romance to Viola De Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow).There are so many things wrong with this production that I wonder where to even begin. Here are the things that really turned me off the most:-I'm not Shakespeare historian, to be sure, but the plot of this movie seems like complete fiction to me (a real-life romance inspiring 'Romeo & Juliet'). If someone can tell me if this has any basis in fact, please let me know, as I would be very interested. As it were, I could not separate the great play from this cheap effort to produce concurrent narratives. -You can't play Shakespeare off as a goof! Mr. Fiennes may be a better actor in other roles, but he completely lacks the gravitas to play The Bard. -More to the above point, director John Madden is unable to find a medium between comedy and drama. This movie had to be either one or the other, and instead it ends up being neither. In my mind, Shakespeare either has to be taken reverently or be given the 'life and times' approach, looking at him from a real-life perspective. This film does neither. He's a bumbling fool from beginning to end and somehow magically happens to put together this wonderful play. -Don't even get me started on the casting. Ben Affleck is a joke, among others, while I would say that only Paltrow turns in a decent performance from the entire lot.I guess what it came down to for me, then, was the fact that I couldn't 'buy in' to the notion of 'Romeo & Juliet' being inspired by a real-life romance. That seemed like too much of a reach for me. It is mind-boggling to me, in hindsight, that this film snagged the Oscar over 'Saving Private Ryan'. Talking about your Shakespearean tragedy (!).",2,3,5,1 March 2017
Passengers," Everything Just Too Convenient In This Soulless Effort
","As soon as I saw the promotional material for 'Passengers', I was concerned. It looked for all the world like the stereotypical, glossy flick that uses slick special effects to cover up for the fact that it is hollow both in terms of plot and character. On the other hand, this is the exact genre of film that I love, and Jennifer Lawrence's presence will never dissuade me from a film. As it turned out, I was indeed the sucker for seeing this film, which personifies the concept of 'Hollywood slick'.For a basic plot summary, 'Passengers' is the story of the spacecraft Avalon, which is transporting a crew of 5,000 to a new planet that will be colonized much like Earth. A malfunction occurs, and Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up too early...about 90 years too early, to be exact. After some time of crippling loneliness, he makes the momentous decision to wake up fellow passenger Aurora (Lawrence). The duo quickly discover the reason behind the malfunctions and must work together to get the journey back on track.'Passengers' is a film completely devoid of any interesting plot devices or character development. The whole thing is just too 'convenient'. All the main beats can be predicted a mile away, there is no chemistry between Pratt & Lawrence, and what passes for 'character development' in the movie is laughable. A high school film student could have created more interesting, in-depth characters.As such, 'Passengers' is clearly a paint-by-numbers, 'vehicle' film in which everyone involved knew it would make X amount of dollars of profit. In that sense, it hits all the right beats: set in space, slick visuals, Pratt for the ladies, Lawrence for the gentleman, yadda yadda yadda. Creatively, however, those elements add up to absolutely nothing.Perhaps I'm being a bit too harsh in giving 'Passengers' the rock-bottom 1-star treatment (taken strictly as a film it is maybe 2-stars at best), but partially I'm just angry that Hollywood can continue to put out such lackluster efforts. This is especially true when they tantalize me with some of my 'favorite cinema things' (sci-fi, Lawrence, etc.) and then produce such a soulless flop. I'm not completely anti-Hollywood or anything like that, but it still galls me that 'Passengers' can: 1. Even be made; and 2. Be made so poorly with all the money behind it.Simply put: 'Passengers' was one of the most boring, predictable, asinine movies I've seen in quite some time. I can see children liking it (for the visuals and extremely simple plot), date couples flocking to it (for the mass appeal of Pratt & Lawrence), but that is about it. Creatively, the tank gauge rests fully on 'Empty'.",2,3,7,26 February 2017
The Hunger Games," Did You Like/Dislike The Book? Ditto For This
","After reading 'The Hunger Games' novel, I gave it a solid 4 stars out of 5. I had a very similar reaction to this movie, an indication of the faithfulness of the book-to-film transfer.For a basic plot summary, 'The Hunger Games' sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) & Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) thrown into a battle-to-the death with 23 other young people as a result of a '1984'-like dystopian society bent on total population control. Living in a society completely controlled by 'The Capitol', Katniss & Peeta struggle to survive in the deathly competition while at the same time sending a message of hope to the thirteen districts watching the Hunger Games event.In terms of being faithful to the book, this movie succeeds tremendously. Director Gary Ross takes a great written story and adeptly adapts it to the big screen. All the major events happen as written by Suzanne Collins, while even the minutiae is, for the most part, accurate. There's really nothing to get upset over in the translation, besides (of course) the usual pairing down of some background dialogue to keep the film from going even longer than its 2 hours, 22 minute runtime.The casting/acting is also quite well-done. About the only cast member that didn't potentially live up to the billing was Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Other than that, I really enjoyed the two leads as well as the auxiliaries such as Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, & Elizabeth Banks, to name a few.Basically, 'The Hunger Games' movie succeeds because of the strength of the original story and the faithful adaptation of that story. Because this is (at heart) a young-adult story, a lack of deeper character development & plots prevents me from giving it a full five stars (fair or not). Other than that, though, there is nothing else negative I can say about the experience.",8,1,3,10 March 2017
12 Monkeys," A Straightforward Time-Travel Film (If Such A Thing Exists)
","Many time-travel films almost require viewers to hold a degree in quantum physics or be able wrap their brains around complicated concepts to understand the plot. Fortunately, '12 Monkeys' goes a different direction: it's a mind-bending, time-travel adventure that is both intellectually stimulating yet also easy enough to understand even for a casual viewer.The basic plot of the film focuses on James Cole (Bruce Willis), a prisoner from 'the future' (1997; where all surviving humans now live underground due to an apocalyptic event), who is sent back in time to try and gather information to prevent the catastrophe. While skipping through time, Cole meets two people, Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and mental patient Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who ultimately prove crucial to his mission of saving humanity from an underground existence.The brilliance of this film is that while most time-travel plots are either overwhelming or overly simplistic, director Terry Gilliam finds the perfect mix here. Upon completion of viewing, I was quite certain that I understood what had just transpired (a feat never to be overlooked when dealing with time-travel). Only after some auxiliary study did I begin to consider some alternate interpretations, none of which cheapen that original reaction in any way.The acting is also solid, with Willis progressing the Cole character very nicely (from completely lost--like the viewers--to informed and ready for action), Pitt turning in a good show as the manic Goines, and Stowe portraying the every-person who, like viewers, must be convinced that all of this is really happening.I can recommend '12 Monkeys' to any and all fans of science fiction, mystery, suspense, and action films for its ability to strike the right balance between mind-stimulating material and overall comprehension (i.e. it doesn't let itself get bogged down in ideology or technicalities). Plus, I have found it to be a unique experience in that it can easily be viewed multiple times, as little tidbits can/will be noticed each time through.",9,2,3,12 March 2017
42," A Much-Needed Modern Update On A Historic Sporting/Cultural Event
","Though perhaps seeming preposterous to baseball fans, sports fans, or just cultural historians in general, there are many younger people alive today who do not know the incredible story of Jackie Robinson. Despite the fact that such an inspirational tale SHOULD be known and loved by all, part of the reason for the disparity is because the last mainstream-media version of the story was produced in 1950...just three years after Jackie broke the color barrier and starring Mr. Robinson as himself! Though a nice film in its own right, '42' truly captures the poignancy of the story using Hollywood drama.For a basic plot summary, '42' recounts how Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman), with the help of Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), broke Major League Baseball's color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Along the way viewers are introduced to other key players in the Robinson saga including wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie), manager Leo Durocher (Christopher Meloni), and fellow teammates like Pee Wee Reese (Lucas Black) and Dixie Walker (Ryan Merriman).In terms of telling the basics about the Jackie Robinson story, '42' is a superb rendition. All of the important events are touched upon and in their proper places, while even the little details (like what the old-time stadiums looked like) are replicated. You'll feel like you are truly back in late 1940's America, warts and all.What truly makes this film stand out, though, is the acting from pretty much all the main characters. Ford especially shines with his spot-on Rickey, while Boseman embodies the courage, grace, and often torment that Robinson perpetuated on a day-to-day basis. On one occasion, Alan Tudyk (playing a particularly galling opposing manager) shines in his portrayal of the kind of racism that was hurled at Jackie from ballpark to ballpark.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars? Simplicity. This is very much a 'by the basics' type of movie and thus if (like me) you already know the ins-and-outs of the Robinson story, it won't have you thinking about anything new or touch any emotions that you haven't already felt. This is very much a film for those you know nothing about Robinson.Overall, though, '42' is an excellent choice of film-making if only because it revives a subject in desperate need of a face-lift. The experience can be enjoyed by the entire family (children all the way on up) and pretty much every segment of the population. I am glad that it was made.",8,2,2,5 March 2017
Rocky V," Coming Full Circle
","The legend of Rocky Balboa grew out of the harsh streets of Philadelphia, and in this 'final' (at the time) installment, that is exactly the place where the tale winds down.For a basic plot summary, 'Rocky V' finds the title character (Sylvester Stallone) having sustained irreversible brain damage after the Drago fight and thus forced into retirement. When Paulie (Burt Young) makes a financial snaffu, the Balboa family loses their fortune and must return to their old living quarters in Philly. While there, Rocky begins training a young, hungry fighter named Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison), while Rocky Jr. (Sage Stallone) struggled to cope with his new environment.Likely due to a change in direction (Stallone hands the reins back to John Avildson), this film is more like the original than any of the other sequels, from the tone of the drama to the actual locations. This turns out to be a smart move for the franchise, as it allows for a bit of closure (coming full circle) to the overall narrative. It never ceases to amaze me that Stallone was able to keep the Rocky Balboa character so fresh, considering how most of his other film 'icons' are anything but.There are two very hokey situations that you must first get over in order to enjoy this movie:1. The aging of Rocky Jr. When Rocky leaves for Russia in the fourth film, his son isn't more than 8-9 years old. When Rocky comes back, still sporting the bruises from Drago, his kid is in roughly late middle school. This is a huge continuity issue in order to make other portions of the movie make sense dramatically.2. Paulie losing all of Rocky's money. Couldn't director Avildson have come up with anything better than that for why the Balboa's have to move back to Philadelphia?If you can put those concerns in the rear view mirror, though, than there are plenty of themes/moments in this film that will entertain you:-The Don King clone, which was (is?!) a real issue in boxing during the 1980s and 90s. -The Rocky/Tommy relationship, which is fated for failure right from the get-go but still makes you feel for Rocky since he can no longer physically enter the ring. -The son angle. Rocky tries to 'do for' his family to make up for the lost fortune, but eventually realizes that all he needs to do is 'do with' them in order to preserve the family unit. -A touching scene at the old gym in which Rocky reminisces about former trainer Mick (Burgess Meredith). Perhaps the greatest single scene in the entire franchise. -Of course, what would a Rocky film be without a fight scene, but in this case it takes place on the streets, not within a squared circle. The drama is palpable in those final minutes.To me, this film was a fitting end for the Rocky franchise (until, of course, it wasn't once Stallone resurrected the franchise this millennium). A few things don't jive, but by-and-large it still provides the character development and high drama that the Rocky series has come to be known for. For whatever reason, Sly Stallone himself has pretty much stricken this movie from the Rocky 'anthology' because of his deep hatred for it, but I don't see the reasoning. I enjoyed it through and through.",8,2,2,11 March 2017
Argo," Affleck Takes A Big Step Forward
","Over the years, I have given Ben Affleck a lot of crap. For whatever reason, I always saw him as the 'second fiddle' to Matt Damon after 'Good Will Hunting' and didn't give him much respect as either an actor or a filmmaker. With 'Argo', however, I got a nice helping of crow, as Affleck proves to be more than a capable director, and in fact turns in an incredible effort.For a basic plot summary, 'Argo' deals the the Iran Hostage Crisis of the President Jimmy Carter administration. When all other ideas to extract the U.S. hostages being harbored by the Canadian Embassy in Iran fail, CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) concocts the craziest idea yet: posing as a fake Hollywood production in order to get inside Iran and smuggle out the Americans.The main reason this film works so well is because the direction from Affleck is superb. The movie contains action, tension, drama, and even some humor, all the while staying focused and 'tight' (never losing track of the overall narrative). From the opening scene until the closing credits, the viewer is sucked into this story and never feels bored or let down.The film also works as a bit of a history lesson regarding the United States and its relations with other Middle Eastern countries (Iran especially, obviously). Since those hostilities still exist to this day, the story of 'Argo' does not feel old or outdated in any sense.Also, Affleck is given a fine supporting cast to work with, including such talent as Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin, and John Goodman, to name a few. Each of the cast members add a little bit of their distinctive talents to the overall production.Thus, 'Argo' is an extraordinary film for its ability to re-create the tension of the Iran Hostage Crisis. I never thought I would ever say this, but if I were voting in the 2013 Academy Awards, I would give the 'Best Director' nod to Affleck over Steven Spielberg.",9,1,3,7 March 2017
Last Flag Flying," Proof That Sometimes Chemistry Alone Can Make A Movie Entertaining
","If and when one gets right down to it, 'Last Flag Flying' is a little bit of a mess, thematically. It tackles a number of different issues/themes, and comes up inconclusive on most of them. The thing is, though, there is such great chemistry between the three leads of the film that it almost doesn't even matter in the end, because their interactions are so entertaining.For a basic plot summary, 'Last Flag Flying' sees Doc Shepherd (Steve Carell), a former Marine, being informed that his son has died in service to his country. Understandably distraught, Doc does the only thing that seem right under the circumstances, which is to reunite with former Corps mates Richard Mueller (Laurence Fishburne) and Sal Nealon (Bryan Cranston). When the trio discover that the military isn't being exactly honest with them about the circumstances surrounding Doc's son's death, they decide to take matters into their own hands and transport the body back home themselves.If there ever was a movie that personifies the phrase 'more about the journey than the destination', this would be it in spades! Along the way, the trio of former military men reminisce about old times, feel guilty about some events, and just generally try to come to terms with their service and what a mixed-up war Vietnam was both overseas and stateside. As I said in the opening paragraph, there are a lot of lofty themes thrown around during the runtime of this film. Some work...some don't. All told, the plot really doesn't amount to much in the end anyway.But boy oh boy, is it ever fun to watch Sal, Doc, and the Reverend (Fishburne's character is now a minister, much to the delight of the gang) share the screen. Sometimes, three actors the caliber of Fishburne, Carrell, and Cranston would react like oil and water to each other. The exact opposite happens here, as instead all three bounce perfectly off of each other all film long. Carrell has more of the emotional role, Cranston is the clown, and Fishburne just rolls his eyes at it all (the straight man, if you will). It had been a long time since I had watched a film where the actors so firmly make the proceedings watchable even despite some meandering plot issues.Now, don't get me wrong...it's not like 'Last Flag Flying' is devoid of plot. It indeed does just enough to keep events moving forward. What I'm saying, though, is that this is a film where the character interactions so effortlessly steal the show that it can still be enjoyable even with some pretty simplistic plot structures moving it along. One scene, where the guys just sit around on a train and talk about their past Marines experiences, might be the best of the whole show. That's quite a feat!Despite being directed by Richard Linklater (now mostly known for the incredibly deep--and Oscar-successful--'Boyhood'), 'Last Flag Flying' will likely never ascend to 'classic' status. There just really isn't enough to it. If you are just looking for some great acting performances and verbal back-and-back from iconic actors, however, this will be something you can thoroughly enjoy.",7,1,4,6 February 2018
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great Follow-Up To The Stellar Original
","I loved J.J. Abrams' 2009 reboot of the franchise for the way it expertly brought back the characters Trek fans know and love (even roping in a whole new audience in the process). With 'Into Darkness', Abrams and his crew again craft an exciting adventure, this time echoing some great Trek lore of the past.For a basic plot summary, this film once again sees Captain James Kirk (Chris Pine), First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto), Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban), and the rest of the crew manning the Enterprise. When terrorist James Harrison (Benedict Cumberbatch) detonates an explosive device in England, the Enterprise takes the lead in figuring out just exactly what is going on and proposing the best plan to set things straight again.This is a tough film to review because of potential major spoilers, so the above was about as generic of a plot description as one can give (!). Truth be told, it is a very complex film that hearkens back to many themes running through multiple Original Series adventures.From my point of view, though, the biggest reason that I enjoyed this film so much may be because it builds off the character development of the first to great a great stand-alone Trek story. It even uses the alt-Universe conceit put in place in the first one to weave in some 'old friends' from the Original Series and its own feature films. Basically, the framework set up in the original is expertly built upon here to create a more stand-alone story with a more interesting villain.The visuals are worthy of Trek science fiction, the dialogue is snappy and contains doses of humor at vital points, the acting is spot-on, and the soundtrack (from Michael Giacchino) is a treat.Thus, 'Into Darkness' continues this franchise in the right direction. I do not understand the criticisms that have been heaped upon the film (most specifically the overt references to previous Trek material), as I enjoyed nearly every moment of it.",9,3,7,7 March 2017
12 Angry Men," A Portrait Of Humanity
","When rating the greatest films of all-time, '12 Angry Men' usually ends up close to the top of that list. This is for good reason, as the lasting impact of this masterpiece will forever be its portrayal of humanity in all its various guises.For a basic plot summary, '12 Angry Men' picks up after the trial of a young man charged with killing his father. Eleven jurors are ready to convict the boy and call it a day, but one man (played by Henry Fonda) has a reasonable doubt about the case and refuses to make the vote unanimous. When the jurors get to discussing the case, 'Fonda' finds that he may have more supporters than he originally thought as he lays out his doubts.Set basically in one locale (the juror deliberation room), director Sidney Lumet puts on a master class of introducing the principle actors and slowly easing viewers into their various quirks. This portrait of humanity is so powerful that it carries all 90 minutes of run-time.For a few examples...-A couple of jurors are downright intimidated by the tougher-talking members.-One juror is sick and wants to get out of the heat, while another has tickets to a baseball game 'burning a hole in his pocket' and thus wants to hurry along the proceedings.-Yet another juror is prejudiced against young people and wants to see them all in 'the chair'.Only Fonda is tough enough (in a performance every bit as courageous as, say, the one given by Gregory Peck in 'To Kill A Mockingbird) and honest enough to stand up to his peers and not back down.It certainly helps that the acting in the movie is incredible. Nearly every juror is a great character actor and they all bring something a little different and unique to their respective roles. With names like Fiedler, Cobb, Klugman, Warden, and Begley (to name just a few), this is a true tour-de-force cast.Overall, '12 Angry Men' deserves its place among the film classics. Not too many other flicks can match its honest portrayal of the human condition--warts, bright spots, and everything in between.",9,1,2,8 March 2017
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Don't Compare It To LOTR (Let It Stand On Its Own)
","When I first saw 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe' in theaters, I left with a little bit of a bad taste in my mouth. The reason? At the time, I couldn't help but comparing it to the 'Lord of the Rings' series. However, after reading Tolkien's classic novel again and then re-re-watching this movie, I can now see it as a great adaptation that is very true to the source material.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of the Pevensie family siblings, who are shipped off into the English countryside to avoid the carnage of WWII. While at the mansion of their eccentric uncle, they find a wardrobe that mysterious leads to another world called Narnia. Little Lucy (Georgia Henley) goes in first and meets a Faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy). Then Edmund (Skandar Keynes) stumbles in and meets a much more nefarious personality...the White Witch (Tilda Swinton), self-proclaimed 'Queen of Narnia'. Later on, older siblings Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Peter (William Moseley) discover Narnia and find themselves in a conflict that they themselves have been deeply prophesized within.The Narnia books were made for children (but well-written enough for adults to enjoy the experience), and that is exactly what this movie is like. If you try (like I once did) to compare it to LOTR, it will never measure up because you are not comparing like quantities. LOTR is an epic drama, while the Chronicles are a lighter-hearted children's drama. This film really captures that spirit, what with the great special effects, the sibling interplay, and just the general whimsical- ness of the overall production. It's 'played straight', don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fun involved too.What might just stand out the most, though, is the acting. Little Georgia as Lucy almost steals the show at some points with her incredible emotional range for such a young child, while Skandar's Edmund is spot-on as the mischievous Edmund (a character who is so important in showing that even in Narnia it can be difficult to tell the good from the bad sometimes). Also, casting Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan, the true ruler of Narnia, was a stroke of genius. Each time the great lion speaks, it will send chills down your spine.So, even though I didn't fully appreciate this movie when it first came out, I can now see it as a faithful adaptation to its source novel. Both mediums are meant for children and not to be compared to older, more adult fare. I don't know of a child alive who wouldn't be captivated by this movie, and I'm sure that's just the way C.S. Lewis would have wanted it.",9,1,1,4 March 2017
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Strong In Every Area
","Usually, I'm not a huge fan of this rom-com genre. There are just too many opportunities for films of this nature to go astray, from acting to story to ridiculousness. Fortunately, 'Crazy Stupid Love' doesn't fall prey to those traps and instead provides a tight, stylish, funny, and even moving production that appeals to a broad range of movie-watchers.For a basic plot summary, 'Crazy Stupid Love' sees a middle-aged couple (played by Steve Carell & Julianne Moore) get a sudden divorce, shaking their family to the core. Concurrently, a suave love-guru (Ryan Gosling) takes Carell's sad-sack character and tries to turn him into a ladies man, all the while pursuing a mysterious, fresh-faced girl (Emma Watson) who is unlike any girl he has met before.The calling-card of this flick is its ability to carry multiple plot lines over the duration of the film until they all converge in the end. There is never a shortage of things going on, all related to the central concept of the 'craziness of love'.The acting has to be great for a movie like this to succeed, and that is exactly what we get here. While all the actors are impressive in their own right, it's their chemistry that really shines here. By the end, all of the major players have interacted with each other, and it all comes off seamlessly.The 'polish' of this film is also impressive. Everything is just so slick, from the dialogue to the clothing and especially the young cast members (Gosling & Stone, in particular). In short, this movie lacks nothing in the production-value department.Overall, then, 'Crazy Stupid Love' is a film that can be enjoyed by teens on up for a variety of different reasons. I watched primarily for Carell's acting, but was quickly drawn in by the innocent beauty of Stone and the slickness of Gosling. I'm sure you'll find a reason to be sucked in as well.",10,3,4,10 March 2017
Green Room," A Bit Exclusionary, But Still Entertaining
","There is no doubt that 'Green Room' is an exciting film, and one that will keep you entertained until the very end. Here's the thing, though: From a film studio (A24) that has produced some of my absolute favorite films the past few years, 'Green Room' didn't quite measure up. I think the reason is because its punk-rock atmosphere leaves out a fair number of viewers who can't quite relate.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the punk-rock band the 'Ain't Rights', comprised of Pat (Anton Yelchin), Reece (Joe Cole), Sam (Alia Shaukat), and Tiger (Callum Turner). They are the typical 'struggling band', siphoning gas from parked cars just to make it to the next gig. When that 'next gig' happens to take them to a Nazi skinhead bar in Oregon, however, they witness an atrocity and are not allowed to leave (these people deal with things themselves). When the situation escalates, club owner Darcy (Patrick Stewart) is called onto the scene in order to control the chaos...and he is a man who certainly doesn't care if ultimate, violent force is used to get the job done.The most interesting themes of 'Green Room' surround the skinhead culture of violence in order to make sure that problems are 'solved' without 'outside intervention'. When the band members decide to fight back a bit instead of just rolling over in the face of threats, Darcy brings out a combination of dogs, weapons, and cold-blooded killers that can truly be chill-inducing. So, one could say that just the sheer, stark violence of the picture is a 'plus' (if you aren't immediately turned off by it) in that it manages to be legitimately creepy and dark.The problem I had with this movie, though, is that I felt like I was kind of on the outside looking in due to the fact that I have no experience with clubs, live rock music, or punk-rock culture. That could be a 'me problem', but I wonder if it also won't discourage others who might be in the same boat. It was just very difficult for me to relate to the characters, and that was a problem in a sub-90 minute piece that doesn't leave much time for character development.Also, 'Green Room' is a rather stark departure from A24's more mysterious or mind-stimulating fare, instead opting for a shot of adrenaline to the senses. I prefer the former type of film- making, but those who more appreciate the latter will like this one better than I.So, while I was never bored with 'Green Room' and indeed enjoyed certain aspects of it, as a whole it doesn't stick out to me as anything special (even in A24's own collection). Maybe I've just been spoiled by A24's tradition of excellence at the cinema that anything below that (or not appealing directly to my film tastes) seems a bit off. Either way, this one was 'just okay' in my eyes.",5,2,7,27 February 2017
Us," What More Could One Ask For In A Film?!
","Back in 2017, I enjoyed Jordan Peele's 'Get Out' (giving it 8/10 stars here). However, my one 'beef', if you will, with that flick was that I felt it couldn't stand alone without the social commentary. As a straight suspense thriller, it likely doesn't work. To me, that is where 'Us' separates itself from even that solid effort and vaults into the rarified air of all-time classic. It is an incredible social commentary, yes, but can/could also stand alone as just a spooky horror/suspense movie nearly as well.For a basic plot summary, 'Us' tells the story of the Wilson family: husband Gabe (Winston Duke), wife Adelaide (Lupita Nyong'o), son Jason (Evan Alex) and daughter Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph). What starts as a pretty typical middle-class family vacation quickly takes a dark turn when a family shows up in the driveway of their getaway bungalow in the middle of the night. The Wilsons quickly discover that this mystery family is a doppelgänger of their own unit...but in a dark, twisted way. The alternate-Wilsons terrorize the real-Wilsons, and viewers are left in the dark until nearly the very end of the film in terms of why this is happening.There are so many interesting concepts in play here, some of which include:-Some great family dynamics and character-building in the early goings. For the social-message piece of 'Us' to work we need to care about the characters, and that is not a problem here. The humor gets a bit over-the-top at times, but nothing that takes you out of the experience too much.
-The concept of doppelgängers is always a bit of a spooky one, and 'Us' plays this to the hilt. This is where the film can and does work as a straight suspense piece.
-Flashbacks centering on Adelaid's character give the film much-needed backstory and set the table for what is to come. These treks into the past are also wonderful for the little touches that Peale uses to create a sense of place, from the music to the clothing worn and the language/slang spoken.Then, of course, there is the final 15-20 minutes that quite literally changes everything (which I will not entirely spoil here). There are two ways that 'twist ending' films usually work: Either the twist comes as a complete surprise with really no way of guessing it (see: 'The Village'), or breadcrumbs are laid throughout and it still manages to catch the viewer off-guard (see: 'The Sixth Sense'). As a movie-watcher who is always very engaged in the experience, I have a tremendous amount of respect for the latter approach, and that is exactly what 'Us' does to perfection. Not only does the ending completely shock the viewer with its social declaration and implications, but also in how certain signs were pointing that way all along.Overall, there was never a single minute spent watching 'Us' that I was disengaged from the experience. Whether it was the flashbacks, character-building, tension/suspense, or social commentary, this one had me hook, line, and sinker. I'm not usually one for immediately re-watching a film after the original viewing, but this is the rare exception in that it can be experienced in nearly a completely different way once the first viewing is complete and 'mentally processed'. To me, this is cinema at its finest.",10,21,42,4 April 2019
Ted," Legitimizing The 'Family Guy' Humor Set
","Because the 'Family Guy' TV show has been on the air for over a decade now, there is an entire generation of comedy fans who have grown up with its raunchy, celebrity-bashing, voice-acting, frat-party style of humor. As such, a film like 'Ted' can now wildly succeed in a contained theater format, and it does (in this case) with hilarious results.For a basic plot summary, 'Ted' sees young John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) giving life to his childhood teddy bear (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) via a magical wish one long-ago Christmas night. Fast-forward about 26 years, however, and suddenly Ted is now a pot-smoking, wise- cracking, babe-chasing celebrity who keeps John from realizing his full potential. When girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) comes into John's life, John must ultimately choose between her and Ted in order to figure out what his future will hold.Quite obviously, this movie is made for the 'Family Guy set'. I mean, practically ever FG voice makes some kind of appearance here, and the jokes are of the same sort of crude/sexual/celebrity/juvenile nature. As such, I know a number of individuals who would walk out of the theater in disgust. For those who 'get it', though, it is absolutely hilarious. I don't want to go into any details and ruin the fun of many of the film's best jokes, but suffice it to say that you'll never go more than a couple of minutes with a belly-laugh.Besides the jokes, the acting is also tremendous. Kunis is fast becoming the 'Queen of the rom- com' and turns in another great performance here, while Wahlberg is convincing as a sort of 'Peter Pan' character who is in no hurry to grow up. MacFarlane's voice of Ted (in which can be heard all of Peter, Brian, & Stewie from FG fame) never gets old either.Also, there is more to 'Ted' than just comedy. It contains some impressive action sequences, as well as some character development and drama surpassing that which one would expect in movies that SHOULD showcase those things. This movie, despite the humor type, takes itself very seriously at its core and strives to provide more than just the laughs that one knows will exist coming in.In essence, 'Ted' is a sort of 'coming of age' for Seth McFarlane's unique set of skills. Whereas he once was thrown off FOX's airwaves for being a little too crude, he can now make a movie about a pot-smoking, expletive-spewing teddy bear that leads its opening weekend at the box office. Why the switch? Because, after years of honing his comedic style, MacFarlane found the right mix of actors and tone to produce a movie that stands up well on its own merits.",10,1,2,7 March 2017
Spider-Man 2," Too Contrived To Create Any Sort Of High Drama
","After being intrigued by my introduction to the Spiderman character (through the first film), I was very excited to see what the second installment would bring now that the whole duel-identity thing was established. Before the end credits had finished rolling, however, I knew that I wouldn't enjoy this film as much as its predecessor. I noticed that the screenplay was written by Al Gough and Miles Millar, the creators of TV's Smallville (a show I watch weekly). I should have been excited by that knowledge, as they created a very interesting show, but instead I felt my heart drop, as I knew EXACTLY the kind of contrived character relationships that would follow (think Clark/Lana on Smallville and you'll understand).The basic plot of the film has Spidey hanging up his red and blue suit in order to spend more time as Peter Parker with crush Mary Jane Watson. Of course, just when things are looking up for that relationship, the evil Dr. Octopus begins to wreak havoc on New York City, essentially forcing the return of Spiderman and the break-up of Peter and MJ.While that short synopsis may sound like it has great potential for high drama, it (sadly) fails to deliver. Millar and Gough just seemed to be rehashing the plot of Superman II, where Supes gives up his powers to be with Lois Lane only to see General Zod begin terrorizing Earth. Thus, the storyline of the movie was a bit predictable.Also, again like Clark Kent and Lana Lang in Smallville, the Peter/MJ relationship is far too contrived and up-and-down to provide any real emotional scenes. I never felt as if I really cared whether or not Peter/Spidey would save/love Mary Jane. Adding to the lack of drama was a general lack of acting from Tobey Maguire, who seemed to react to every situation with that same wide-eyed expression. While that tact worked very well while first harnessing his abilities in the first film, in this movie it just gets old.Finally, while the villain Doc Ock is visually pretty cool (what with all those tentacles flying around!), he again is a bit too much in common with the Green Goblin for my liking, as both were created in freak science experiments gone wrong. Nothing like the intriguing character development of The Joker by Christopher Nolan in The Dark Knight.So, while the special effects of the film were excellent and the action scenes superb, I can't give it any better than an 'average' rating due to all its contrived plots/relationships/characters. If you are easily sucked in to hokey romances, you won't find any fault in this film. If you prefer a more mature love story, though, then just watch it to set up your Spidey 3 viewing experience.",5,7,13,12 March 2017
Batman Returns," Solidly Entertaining, If A Notch Below The Original
","After Tim Burton's 1989 Batman effort proved to be one of the biggest superhero films of all-time, the director wrestled more editorial/creative control away from the Warner Bros. studio heads. What results is a sequel effort that is closest to Burton's unique (i.e. odd) vision of film-making, but still works due to some iconic imagery and acting performances.For a basic overview, 'Batman Returns' sees two new villains introduced to Gotham City: the mysterious sewer-dwelling Penguin (Danny DeVito) who seemingly just wants to find his long-lost parents (but also may have more nefarious goals in mind) and the frazzled secretary Selena Kyle (Michelle Pfieffer), who is harangued by her boss to the point of mental breakdown and the creation of Catwoman. The villains form an uneasy truce due to a common 'enemy' in the way of their plans: Batman (Michael Keaton). Concurrent with the superhero business, Gotham mega-mogul Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) hatches a nuclear power plant scheme that involves the super-trio in various ways. Further complicating matters? Bruce's romantic entanglement with Selena.Despite featuring the same director (Burton), this film feels very different from its predecessor. Whereas that movie was very much grounded in reality (Nicholson's Joker is basically a mob boss, the death of Bruce Wayne's parents is central to the plot, etc.), this one is much more of a gothic fantasy. Penguin is a literal monster, Catwoman is deliciously over-the-top, and even Batman gets more wise-cracks in than usual. It's almost as if Burton figures the character-building material is over and thus pushes straight ahead into fantasy.Another aspect of 'Batman Returns' which also strikes me as odd is how many aesthetic changes (and mostly for the worst, I would argue) are made from the '89 original to this one. Wayne Manor and the Batcave are completely different, the Batsuit and Batmobile also see slight design changes, and the overall tone is just a lot less serious (much more tongue-in-cheek type humor). I don't know why Burton or WB felt compelled to change around so many elements that made the first one so iconic.Fortunately, the film is able to overcome nearly all of these weaknesses due in large part to its iconic villain performances. DeVito's Penguin is genuinely creepy, and all in all largely too spooky for any children who may be watching (a big part of the reason why the franchise went in the flashy Schumacher direction after this). I'm not sure a better representation of a freakish Penguin could ever be created. Pfieffer, while a bit hurt by the odd Kyle character, also portrays Catwoman adeptly. The stitch-based Catsuit is iconic for its visual and sexual aesthetics, and Pfieffer's exuberance both serious and comic is hilariously fun to watch.Also a strong suit of this film is the cinematography. Despite being filmed almost entirely on the WB lot, some of the shots set up some truly remarkable visuals. I'm thinking here of Peguin's lair at the Gotham Zoo and Selena's apartment. In this case, the shift from gritty reality to fantasy may have actually helped, as it allowed for a wilder visual style that really worked here.Overall, 'Batman Returns' is a solid sequel to the blockbuster original. It often gets a bad rap due to its darker tone/feel, but considering the two vastly inferior films that succeeded it I'll take 'dark' any day of the week. The only reason I give it a slight star reduction (9 to 8) from '89 is because of what I can only term a bit too much of 'Burton strangeness'. Despite feeling constrained by the studio in making the first one, that reigning-in might have actually helped Burton come to a more coherent product. Here, Burton is free-wheeling in his vision all the way through. More of it 'hits' than 'misses', but it still isn't quite to the bar the franchise had previously set.",8,3,9,12 March 2017
Finding Nemo," 'Nice'
","There have always been three reasons why these animated Pixar films have appealed to us all so much. First, of course, is the fact that they are just plain so much fun. Second, is that they have a message that tugs on the heartstrings of young and old. Finally, they are full of humor for both the target children and the adults watching with them. 'Finding Nemo' is no exception to any of those categories.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees young clownfish Nemo (Alexander Gould) accidentally become separated from his over-protective father Marlin (Albert Brooks). As Nemo has his own adventures in a tropical fish tank owned by a dentist, Marlin begins his quest to rescue his young son, along the way running into the memory-challenged Dory (Ellen Degeneres) who ultimately shows him a new perspective on life.Visually, 'Finding Nemo' is stunning. Watching it on blu-ray is truly a visual treat, with the underwater landscapes and their various colors making this effort perhaps the best-looking Pixar flick ever.In terms of humor, 'Nemo' has enough moments that will have the kids giggling as well as the adults chuckling. It can be a very serious movie at times, but it never forgets to mix a healthy dose of fun into the proceedings.The main plot line--Marlin looking for Nemo--turns out to be quite an emotional punchline, as Marlin slowly begins to discover the things he needs to do different if/when he finds his son.Overall, 'Finding Nemo' deserves a place towards the highest ranking of Pixar endeavors. Though nothing may ever quite top 'Toy Story', 'Nemo' belongs on that '1-B' slot right along with 'WALL-E' and 'Up'.",10,1,2,7 March 2017
Superbad," If You're Here For Emma Stone: It's Not Worth It
","After watching such great movies as 'Crazy Stupid Love' and 'The Help', I recently became a huge fan of actress Emma Stone. As such, I decided to go back in a time a bit to see what other movies she had done. I watched 'Easy A' and still was impressed, so I decided to take a gander at 'Superbad', as I am up for a 'teen loser comedy' every once in awhile. The verdict? A complete and utter waste of time.For a basic plot summary, 'Superbad' sees two teenage losers played by Michael Cera & Jonah Hill trying to party it up together one last time before heading to different colleges after graduation. Typical teen hijinks involving sex, drugs, alcohol, and cops ensue.The trouble with this movie is that it doesn't add anything new to its genre. There is nothing I saw here that I haven't seen in other similar flicks. While it is billed as 'from the creators of Knocked Up & The 40 Year Old Virgin', this film can't hold a candle to either of those efforts. It is extremely vulgar, incredibly crude, and the jokes really aren't even all that funny. At it's core, this is a gross-out movie trying to pass itself off as something more (which it isn't).Thus, if you came here for Emma Stone (like I did), it isn't worth it in the slightest. Go watch her couple of scenes in the movie on YouTube and forget about it. You'll be much better off not wasting your time.",1,2,7,9 March 2017
Creed," It's Not 'Rocky VII'...And That's Not A Bad Thing
","In 2006, Sylvester Stallone seemingly put the final coda on the Rocky series with 'Rocky Balboa', a very inspirational film that may have been the best of the entire franchise. As such, when the rumors began circulating about a project to quasi-revive that Rocky universe in a film about the son of Apollo Creed, they were met with laughter (at best) and downright derision (at worst). With the touching way that Stallone left the franchise in 'Balboa', why did we need something else? Would anyone care about Apollo's son? Stallone would not be lending his writing talents to the project, and a young director (Ryan Coogler) would be stepping behind the camera.To be completely honest, I had very little hopes for this film. I wondered why I would care, and I wondered if this was the right story to tell. Fortunately, I was proved wrong in pretty much every aspect, as this turns into a wonderful film that seemingly does the impossible: have Stallone's Rocky character in a movie that isn't primarily about him.For a basic plot summary, 'Creed' tells the story of Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the illegitimate son of Apollo Creed. Raised by Apollo's wife Mary Anne (Phylicia Rashad), Adonis seems to be on the right track after a rough beginning in foster care. He has a comfortable job and even just got promoted. On the side, though, Adonis is boxing in some sketchy joints in Mexico, where his success convinces him to quit the day job and go professional like his father (a relationship which has been kept under wraps...Adonis goes by the last name Johnson). He quickly discovers, however, that he's going to need to get a lot tougher to compete in the professional ranks. As such, he leaves his California hometown and travels across the country to Philadelphia, where he seeks out Rocky (Stallone) to try and convince him to become his trainer.The key thing to understand about this movie is that you can't look at it as 'Rocky VII'. During my first viewing in the theater, I kept waiting for that trumpet theme to kick in or maybe a training montage to 'Gonna Fly Now'. That's not the style of this movie, though. If anything, it is more of a modernized version of the original 'Rocky', with Adonis as the hungry up-and-coming and Rocky as the Mick-like trainer figure. It is set in modern Philly and has a very urban feel to the proceedings. Originally, I was disappointed in this style, but the more I thought about it and read other opinions, the more I began to understand that this was the way that movie had to be made. Though I identify with the original 'Rocky' more than this film, I'm sure 'Creed' is a more modern inspiration to people in the same vein.I think the hallmark of this film is probably it's incredible acting by all involved. Jordan is more than capable as the young Adonis (as I knew he would be from his work in other roles), while Stallone again proves that he understands the Rocky character more than any other role he's ever played. It must have been difficult for Sly to keep himself at a distance (not writing/directing) and let someone else 'tell him how to be Rocky', but I think it pays off here in that both the classic and the modern come together almost perfectly. Had Stallone been more actively involved, the project may not have had that 'modern grit' that it was going for.The main reason I can't give this a full five stars is because for all the good things the film does, it struggles a bit in the early goings in developing the Adonis character. It seems like a few plot lines aren't followed up on as well as they should be (perhaps in favor of showcasing 'Philly culture' a bit too much), and it took me longer than what I'm sure the film-makers would have intended in order for me to really start getting emotionally attached to the character. The scenes with Rocky had no trouble doing that (because of the history of the character), but it just takes a bit too long for Adonis.Overall, though, I think one has to consider 'Creed' a rousing success. Despite a few shortcomings in plotting and character development, it manages to tell a compelling story while inter-weaving it with the history of the Rocky Balboa character and its franchise. Stallone could easily be up for some hardware for his generational performance, while Jordan has now cemented himself on the fast track to Hollywood success. Whether you have seen all the Rocky films multiple times or haven't seen a single one once, 'Creed' will have something to pull you in.",9,1,2,26 February 2017
The Natural," Despite Its Flaws, It Sure Can Evoke Emotion
","'The Natural' is a strange move by any sense of the imagination. One minute, it can be as serious as any movie ever made. The next minute, an outfielder crashes through the wall, dies, and has his ashes spread over the field in a later game. Despite the oddities that pop up here and there, though, 'The Natural' remains a classic for one simple reason: it will move you emotionally in the end.For a basic plot summary, 'The Natural' tells the story of Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford), a young pitcher who seems to have the world on a string on his way to the major leagues. When a freak accident takes him out of the game for many years, though, he comes back a wily, grizzled veteran just hoping for another chance. He gets that chance with the Knights, coached by Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley). While figures such as the team owner (Robert Prosky) and prominent sports writer Max Mercy (Robert Duvall) want to see him fail, Hobbs shows the type of perseverance that legends are made of.Like I said in the opening, 'The Natural' can be a really strange movie at times. It's almost like director Barry Levinson doesn't quite understand how strange his dramatic tone shifts were as the film rolls along. While some view this as quirky and giving the movie its own style, I see it as a negative (the only reason it doesn't get my full five stars and vault into 'Field of Dreams' territory).That being said, 'The Natural' does more than enough things right to still remain a classic movie. Certain sequences (striking out The Whammer (Joe Don Baker), 'pick me out a winner, Bobby', etc.) are now etched into iconic film & baseball lore. Then, of course, there is that ending. I don't care how cheesy you might have thought the movie up until that point was, but if that final scene doesn't move you to tears, you probably have a stone in place of a heart. When it comes to 'greatest single scene in a baseball movie of all-time', Hobbs' final at-bat probably takes home the prize.One must also comment on the music of 'The Natural', as that is part of the reason why it resonates on such an emotional level. I don't think I could name too many soundtracks that top this one. The main theme is now a mainstay, and it seems like all the scenes in the film are backed by the perfect instrumentals.Overall, 'The Natural' is a slice of 'baseball Americana', if not a perfect one. There are moments that will probably make you shake your head out of weirdness, but more often than not you will find yourself falling for Roy Hobbs and his quest for the American dream...baseball style.",7,3,3,4 March 2017
The Others," The Very Best Of Its Kind
","'Sometimes, the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living'. With that simple phrase uttered in 'The Others', perhaps the greatest horror/thriller in cinema history commences.For a basic plot summary, 'The Others' sees Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) and her two photo- sensitive (can't be exposed to any natural light) children living in an old mansion in post-WW2 Europe. While waiting for the father of the house to return from war, the house and family are suddenly intruded-upon by seemingly otherworldly inhabitants, who have the ability to come and go as they please, sight unseen.I wish I could say so much more about this incredible film, but doing so would likely ruin the overall experience. As such, I'll just say this: The only other films in this genre that even challenge this on are 'The Sixth Sense' and 'What Lies Beneath'. Not too shabby of company, for sure.Also, please--whatever you do!--do not pass this movie by because it is advertised as a 'ghost story'. It is more truly a psychological thriller with a paranormal element.Overall, 'The Others' is on my 'short list' of greatest films of all-time. Many films claim to channel master director Alfred Hitchcock, and most fail (often miserably). This one actually delivers.",10,1,1,11 March 2017
Dead Poets Society," Only Clichéd Now Because It Is Such A Classic
","Sometimes a film can become clichéd due to sheer overexposure. Since Dead Poets Society came out in 1989, it has been used in nearly every English classroom in the United States at least once, I believe. As a result, it suffers from severe overexposure to the general public. However, as a viewer watching the film for the first time, I was not privy to the clichés, and thus enjoyed it very much.For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on a prestigious East Coast preperatory school. The students at said school have their entire future planned out, and are under intense pressure to succeed. Introduced to this atmosphere is new professor John Keating (Robin Williams), whose teaching philosophy in equal parts rankles the traditional faculty, inspires his students, and forever changes the landscape of the institution.This movie is groundbreaking in its portrayal of the teacher-student relationship. However, the true genius of the filmmaking is that the issues are presented in shades of grey, not black and white. Many situation are incredibly complex and have no concrete 'correct answers', but this film valiantly tackles them anyway. It doesn't shy away from reality, and for that I am thankful, as too many films these days over-simplify real-life situations, leading to watered-down scenarios.In terms of casting, Dead Poets Society is a cut above the rest. Williams is tremendous as the inspirational instructor, who isn't too over-the-top, but also injects the requisite amount of passion into the role. Both the professors and students at the prep school are also spot-on in their characterizations.Thus, I highly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't yet had the pleasure. It may be highly clichéd these days, but that is only because it has been around for so long. It truly is an amazing film that should only get better with time.",9,2,2,12 March 2017
Home Alone," 'I Made My Family Disappear'
","Some movies are made strictly for adults. Others will bore the heck out of us 'seasoned' viewers and appeal only to children. Luckily, this movie is made for everyone!For a basic plot summary, 'Home Alone' sees young Kevin McCalister (Macaulay Culkin) waking up a few days before Christmas in a completely empty house, his extremely large and rather disorganized family having left him behind on their trip overseas. While the family tries to get back home, Kevin must outwit a pair of two-bit thieves (played by Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) who want nothing more than to loot his home.What really makes this film special is the wide appeal of the humor. One could literally sit down with the entire family (from young to old) and watch this movie, and everyone would be laughing all the way through. From young Kevin's attempts at 'holding down the fort', to the bumbling burglars played brilliantly by two veteran actors, this is the type of movie that you will be quoting long after the TV is turned off.Thus, I highly recommend 'Home Alone' to quite literally anyone, especially during the Christmas season. If you have a list of 'Must-See' holiday movies, this one should be right next to Frosty, 'Wonderful Life', and claymation Rudolph!",10,1,2,11 March 2017
About Time," A Simple Film That Touches On Many Emotional Themes
","Despite being a huge fan of time-travel films, I let this one languish in my proverbial 'unwatched pile' for quite some time. It looked a bit Nicholas Sparks-ian for me, if you catch my drift. Upon a recommendation, however, I finally decided to give it a try. While not necessarily a perfect film, it was a very enjoyable one that ran the gamut of my emotions the entire way.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who shortly after his 21st birthday is told by his Dad (Bill Nighy) that all the men in the family have a special skill: the ability to travel backwards in time. Initially skeptical, Tim soon discovers this to be the truth. After a serendipitous encounter with Mary (Rachel McAdams), who later becomes his wife and mother of his children, Tim lives his life using that time travel power both for good and for ill.So many time-travel films get caught up by either trying to explain the ins and outs of the process (a fool's errand), or having the entire movie centered upon that one point. In 'About Time', a different approach is taken, and one that comes off as refreshing. See, 'About Time' really isn't a 'time travel movie' at all. It is a pretty traditional love story, in all honest, only using the 'hook' of time travel to build its basic structure.That is truly where the strength of the picture lies: the simple character moments that all good romance films possess. The chemistry between Gleeson and McAdams is special, and just the entire universe they are living in is very relatable. These are character types and situations that almost anyone can relate to, with of course that pesky little time travel detail cropping up and either all the right or wrong times.My only complaint about this movie? I believe that slightly better direction might have produced a bit more coherent of an ending. Though I saw exactly what it was going for in terms of theme, it feels very abrupt and not necessarily 'earned'. Not bad, just more a sense of 'I wish these specific themes would have been touched on more throughout the film'.Overall, though, perhaps the greatest compliment I can give 'About Time' is how many different audiences it could appeal too. Adolescents or the elderly, men or women, film novices or seasoned cinephiles, there are so many potential audiences for the movie because it touches on so many different themes. In the end, it is a wonderfully unique combination of science fiction, romance, and human drama.",8,2,2,9 June 2019
Spotlight," A Hallowing Investigative Treatise
","I'm a big fan of investigative films, with recent-ish efforts like 'Zodiac' and 'The Insider' immediately coming to mind as favorites. 'All The President's Men', of course, is the industry standard for this type of filmmaking. 'Spotlight' can easily hold its own with all those great films.For a basic plot summary, 'Spotlight' tells the story of the investigative crew of the Boston Globe who unearthed a large child abuse scandal (clergy molesting children) that was being covered up by the Catholic Church. Reporters played by Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Liev Schreiber, and John Slattery all combine to pry the lid off of the scandal through diligent reporting and copious research.What I really like about 'Spotlight' is how it presents the material almost without 'editorial comment' (to steal an apt newspaper phrase). This isn't so much a movie about the Catholic Church scandal (though implicitly it can be read as such, I guess) as it is a film about the journalistic/investigative process needed to unearth such facts. As such, there really is very little verbal or explicit moralizing that takes place on screen. Instead, director Tom McCarthy lets the process unspool and allows the viewer to form their own emotions as each new thread is pulled.Of course, it always helps to have such a who's who of acting talent, and they all work perfectly here. They each bring something unique to the film while also functioning as a competent whole.'Spotlight' can be a hard movie to watch at times (the subject matter, without being visually graphic, is difficult to digest), but it ends up being an important treatise on the power of journalism and investigation to reign in the power of establishments that feel they might be above the law. Whether you go to Mass every week or think religion is a bunch of hog-wash, you will still be affected by the message of this film.As such, I now better understand why 'Spotlight' took home Best Picture at the 2016 Academy Awards. Simply put, it is an expertly-crafted film, filled with excellent acting, that also tells an important story. What more can one ask for in a dramatic film?",9,1,1,19 March 2017
Terminator Salvation," Walks The Fine Line Between Paying Homage And Adding To The Cannon
","When I think of the 'Terminator' film franchise, two things immediately come to mind: an iconic leading actor (like Arnold Schwarzenegger) who can carry the film, and an interesting time-travel plot that will keep you engaged while things are blowing up. This film, by casting Christian Bale and continuing the basic timeline, ensures a successful fourth installment.Basically, in 'Terminator Salvation', we finally get a glimpse into the future, where a group of human resistance fighters led by John Connor (Bale) are battling to stay alive as the machines hunt them down one colony at a time. While the war rages on, Connor listens to the tapes handed to him from his mother at the conclusion of T2 and realizes that he must find and protect young Kyle Reese in order to maintain his (and mankind's) entire existence. Complicating matters is the fact that the robotic Skynet has created their ultimate weapon...a 'terminator' who thinks he is a human, throwing Connor and his gang for a loop.Though not a classic film in any sense of the word, I felt that this addition was welcome to the franchise for its ability to show what the earlier films only hinted at...the human resistance against Skynet. The casting of Bale lends automatic credence to the entire project, and he lives up to the billing with the best-acted performance of the show, and the human-cyborg plot angle does two things: preview the 'terminators' of the future, and set up an interesting ethical dilemma for Connor.Plus, I also loved the subtle nods to the three previous installments in the franchise, such as a cameo from Arnold and Bale's own twist on the iconic 'I'll be back' line.Thus, although I feel that this film could have been much more epic, it was, as a fan of the Terminator franchise, entertaining enough to hold my interest until the very end. It also sets the stage for a possible sequel, which would be the true test of whether this re-boot will be the next 'Batman Begins', or instead turn into 'Superman Returns'.",7,6,8,12 March 2017
Insomnia," Solid Cop Drama, But Not Spectacular
","I was originally drawn to this film because of director Christopher Nolan. After viewing his Batman re-boots (Batman Begins & The Dark Knight) and enjoying them immensely, I was hopefully that Nolan's other works would provide some of the same. In the case of Insomnia, he makes a much more 'traditional' film, shrouded in a bit of false advertising to make it seem a bit more mysterious than it really is.For a basic plot summary, the film centers on policeman Will Dormer (Al Pacino), who travels to an Alaskan town to try and solve a murder case. With an Internal Affairs investigation breathing down his neck back home, Dormer is under intense pressure to succeed in this new arena. While teaming with local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank), Dormer not only struggles to solve the case, but also gets mixed up with mysterious writer Walter Finch (Robin Williams).On the whole, this movie functions pretty well as a traditional cop drama. It has the murder mystery, the gun shootouts, and the intrigue plot line which questions the integrity of pretty much everyone involved. Without looking for anything more, this would be a very solid film.However, the film is advertised/promoted as so much more than just a cop drama. The title itself indicates that the condition of insomnia will play a big role in the film, but it does not (Dormer not sleeping doesn't seem to add anything to the plot). Robin Williams's role is billed as a taut, psychological thrill-ride, but he doesn't make an appearance until an hour into the movie and even after that point is severely underutilized. Also, Swank's character is introduced as a potential key part in the film, but she (like Williams) just isn't given anything interesting to do.Thus, I can only give this film an 'average' rating due to its inability to rise above a simple cop drama.",5,1,3,10 March 2017
Juno," Napolean Dynamite/Knocked Up Hybrid That Fails To Be Either
","I watched 'Juno' with a younger (teenaged) sibling hoping that it would provide a good mix of comedy and drama. While the film strives to do just that, it fails to truly define itself in any genre.For a basic plot summary, the movie focuses on Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a 16-year old girl who has sex with fellow student/friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) and ends up pregnant. Because Juno does not want to terminate the pregnancy, she seeks out a potential adoptive family in Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark (Jason Bateman) Loring. Things seem to be going about as well as can be expected for such a tricky situation...at least until the end of the pregnancy approaches.Here is the major problem I had with Juno (and hence the one-star rating): It's almost as if the filmmakers said 'lets combine 'Knocked Up' & 'Napolean Dynamite' into one movie'. A decent idea, but it fails pretty miserably here. It isn't nearly as funny as Napoleon Dynamite, and it doesn't come close to Knocked Up in heart. Simply put, the comedy isn't funny enough to sustain itself, while the drama isn't on par with other films of the same ilk.Another issue? I think that Ellen Page's portrayal of Juno is either hit or miss...no middle ground. I thought her character was annoying and just plain stupid for most of the film, which made the ending (which I will not ruin here) seem almost farcical to me. To me, Juno was one of the most poorly written characters I've ever seen on screen. I didn't empathize with her a single time, which obviously needs to happen if one is to enjoy the experience. The teenager I watched it with? She could have booted up the film again right away, so go figure. Maybe being a teen is needed to 'get' Juno's character.Thus, to me, 'Juno' was a film that didn't make any emotional connections with me in the slightest. Right away, I felt like it was almost blatantly ripping off Napolean Dynamite (which isn't a great film in its own right, but at least some of its humor is timeless), while at the same time trying to cover a very serious topic. Had they done one or the other, I think I would have liked the film a lot more. As it stands, I view it as a rather convoluted mess.",2,2,4,4 March 2017
The Jungle Book," One Of The Great Disney Pictures (Mainly For The Music & Voice Acting)
","Though made in 1967, 'The Jungle Book' still holds up as good as ever today (and probably forever) because of its incredibly catchy tunes and crazy-good voice acting.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees 'man-cub' Mowgli (voice of Bruce Reitherman) adopted by panther Bagheera (Sebastian Cabot) in the jungle. When the threat of Bengal tiger Shere Khan (George Sanders) and his hatred of all things human comes to the jungle, however, Bagheera resolves to place Mowgli in the 'man-village' once and for all. Along the way, however, they encounter a crazy cast of characters that includes the singing bear Baloo (Phil Harris), an orangutan king (Louis Prima), and a slithering snake named Kaa (Sterling Holloway).Though the storyline is filled with enough emotion to never truly get old, the hallmarks of this movie are easily its jazz-based soundtrack and one-of-a-kind voice acting. Every song is catchy in a toe-tapping kind of way, the slow ones add even more emotional depth to the story, and the voices behind the characters are so distinct that they seem to just bring them to life!I watched 'The Jungle Book' over and over and over again as a child, and can still say that I enjoy it today. It is completely family-friendly and can be watched by even the youngest of children. If you haven't shown this one to your children or younger family members/friends yet, it is a must to get them acquainted with this unique jungle world!",9,1,1,5 March 2017
Spider-Man 3," The Best Of The Bunch
","While watching the first two Spiderman films, I was impressed by a few things but also turned off by some as well. I loved the action scenes and the sly little references to the Peter Parker/Spiderman duel identity, but was never really drawn into the Parker-Mary Jane romance or the development (or lack thereof of villains Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus).Thus, in stark contrast to most reviewers, I considered Spiderman 3 to be the best of the bunch due to a focus on even more action, plus better acting by Tobey Maguire as Parker/Spidey. While still progressing the Peter/MJ relationship that screenwriters Miles Millar and Al Gough pretty much ruined in the second film, those scenes take a back seat to Spidey's struggles to fend off three new villains: Hob-Goblin, Sandman, and Venom.With the exception of Parker's friend Harry's Hob-Goblin, which got the short shrift of screen time, I considered both the other villains to be much more interesting than any previous ones. Sandman actually had some character development that made him a true enemy of Parker, while Venom is probably the most interesting element of the entire Spiderman cannon.Besides that focus on action, though, was a much better performance by Maguire. Likely do to the very interesting changes he undergoes while battling with Venom, Maguire is able to emote much more wildly/effectively than in the previous movies (where a wide-eyed stare was about all that ever happened). I especially the scene in which Parker, under the full control of Venom, takes a night out on the town...hilarious!Thus, since I was never really drawn into the relationships/drama of the Spiderman franchise in the first place, I rate this film a cut above the rest for its focus on more action/fight scenes. I can say with confidence that it did NOT kill the film franchise as many other reviewers are suggesting.",9,2,3,12 March 2017
Zodiac," A Real-Life Mystery Of The Highest Order
","Every year, thousands of mystery plots are created by film, television, and literature for our 'viewing pleasure'. Many (dare I say most) of them are conceived from a murder scenario. In the case of 'Zodiac', however, it seems as if the biggest mystery of them all was right under our noses all the time.For a basic plot summary, 'Zodiac' tells the story of the Zodiac killer in California from the late 1960s-early 1970s. In the early stages of the case, police investigator David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and SF Chronicle journalist Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) struggle to catch the letter- writing, cypher-creating homicidal killer. In the end, however, it ends up being low-on-the- totem-poll Chronicle cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhall) who puts all the pieces together...or does he?If you are a fan of action/adventure fare and like a lot of 'flash' up on the big screen, please stay away from this movie. 'Zodiac' is all about savoring the mystery, and thusly unfolds at pace that allows the thinking-viewing to do just that. Before seeing this movie, I had zero previous information about these murders (far, far before my time), so it was utterly fascinating to me to see the amount of time it took for everything to play out. At almost two and a half hours, viewers can't be looking at their watches or they will be missing the point.It would have been easy for 'Zodiac' to come across as a B-movie cop drama, but I think that the presence of director David Fincher ('Se7en', 'Fight Club', 'The Social Network', etc.) makes it into an all-time great. Fincher knows exactly how to walk the fine line of keeping a movie pretty much devoid of 'action' (in the traditional blow/shoot-em-up Hollywood sense) from getting stale, and instead just continuing to build the tension with every scene.Thus, 'Zodiac' is a film I can highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of mystery fare. The fact that it is based on real-life events makes it even more intriguing. Just make sure you go into the experience with the right mindset and with plenty of time to savor this kind of filmmaking. It truly is an underrated gem.",10,2,3,4 March 2017
The Prestige," In My Top Five Films Of All-Time
","Whenever I am given the near-impossible task of 'listing my top five films of all-time', one thing has held the test of time: since I first watched 'The Prestige', it has been firmly ensconced on that list.For a basic plot summary, 'The Prestige' sees two young magicians dueling with each other to see which one can have the most spectacular act. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a family man yet also devoted to his craft, while Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is more of a natural showman with an obsession for greatness. When a tragedy befalls their friendship and they grow apart, an obsession with perfecting the 'Disappearing Man' trick drives both of them to lengths most magicians would not be willing to aspire to.This film is an all-time great primarily because of its tremendous plot. I won't say much about it here for fear of spoilers, but suffice it to say that director Christopher Nolan picked the perfect subject--magic--from which to tell this incredible story. It will keep you guessing until the very end...and then even further as you continue to try and piece together the significance of every scene or character interaction. This film isn't as literally complicated as, say, Nolan's earlier effort 'Memento', but in terms of overall punch and drama it is easily that flick's equal (if not outright superior).The acting is also superb, with Bale & Jackman absolutely brilliant as the leads and Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, Piper Perabu, & Rebecca Hall solidifying the auxiliary players. The slightest of glance or emotion can speak volumes in a film such as this, which features misdirection as one of its core tenants, and all the actors are wonderful at conveying that.Basically, 'The Prestige' is a movie that simply needs to be watched by all. It has the perfect 'hook' in the magic-themed plot, and uses that metaphor as part of the overall storytelling device. Magic is all about obfuscation and sometimes outright deception, which are the main traits that Nolan uses here to craft an intriguing, engaging story and characters. Plus, as sort of an 'added bonus', the film can be watched even as strictly a period piece (turn of the 19th century) and enjoyed thoroughly on that basis alone. Somehow, some way, you will find yourself completely caught up in the grandeur of 'The Prestige'.",10,2,4,8 March 2017
The Terminator," Great Storytelling: A Little Bit Of Everything
","Time-travel. Science fiction. Visions of the future. Action/Adventure. You name it, and 'The Terminator', one of the most genre-diverse films ever made, probably has it.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins in the year 1984. Out of thin air, two individuals suddenly appear and are searching for the same woman: Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). One man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) wants to protect her. The other, a machine simple known as The Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) wants to kill her. As the story unwinds and the chase continues, we are introduced to an intriguing storyline involving time-travel and the fate of the planet.Simply stated, this movie remains a classic to this day because it tells such an engaging, interesting story. It balances the time travel and sci-fi aspects with real-life drama and action. There is a little something for everyone.This was the movie that made the name James Cameron famous, and one can tell that he put a lot of effort into this undertaking. He tells a story that is actually too big (technically-speaking) for it's britches, as it is now obvious that copious amounts of either CGI or plastic were used to create some of the effects. Instead of dating the film, though, these little anachronisms actually give it a bit of gravitas. It was as if Cameron wanted so badly to direct this story, but had to rely on sub-standard equipment to 'get the job done'.Overall, 'The Terminator' is an 80s classic. It is now kind of stereotyped as 'I'll be back' and 'just a shoot-em-up' chase film, but that couldn't be further from the truth. Go back and watch it again, and I promise you'll be equally impressed with the storytelling ability. That, at it's core, is what makes this movie relevant 30 years later.",9,2,2,1 March 2017
Cloverfield," An American Godzilla Take (Also Featuring Character Depth)
","While on vacation in Japan, film producer J.J. Abrams was startled to still see Godzilla merchandise in stores. After decades in the public eye, that monster still had a hold on the national culture. With that experience in mind, Abrams set out to have his production company--Bad Robot--create a similar tale. It succeeds wildly, not only taking viewers on a rip-roaring disaster-epic adventure, but also buffering it with enough human interest moments to make it all hang together.For a very basic overview, 'Cloverfield' begins with a bunch of young New Yorkers throwing a going-away party for one of their own. From their high-rise, however, they witness a terrifying creature wreaking havoc on Manhattan Island. As the film's tag line says: Some thing has found us. When one of them becomes trapped and needs assistance, the film turns into a quest to retrieve her, all the while documenting the attack in a found-footage, handheld camera method of filming.There is very little 'setup' to this movie, which is by design. Director Matt Reeves simply throws viewers into the fracas, which truly makes the experience seem visceral in a lot of ways that other films fail. You will feel as if you are right there with the main characters as they try to navigate the crumbled streets of NYC, every once in awhile getting a glimpse of the hideous, mysterious beast. The filmmakers here very much follow the 'Jaws' rule of only showing glimpses of the creature in the early goings, building upon the suspense with further looks as the movie goes on.But 'Cloverfield' isn't just a mindless disaster epic either. Thanks to the documentarian style of filming and the acting, the characters feel like real people (absolutely necessary for the style of the experience). This is a party that you could be at, with people you could very well know. In order to provide even further depth, the ingeniously simple plot device of showing small flashback clips on the videocamera gives all the motivation necessary to hang with the unfolding events as they happen. Multiple references to terrorism themes also center the film in a post-9/11 world.For many, 'Cloverfield' seems to be a rather polarizing flick. Some don't like the shaky-cam style, while others don't feel it transcends a monster movie destruction epic. For me, though, in terms of pure science fiction (mixed with human drama), I consider this to be one of my favorite little films of all-time. There's never a dull moment (it has less than a 90 minute runtime to begin with) and one just gets the feeling that the entire project was a labor of love and care. While technically a 'studio film' in the sense that it was distributed by Paramount, it was made for a thrifty $25 million and has a very 'indie' feel to it.",9,2,2,10 March 2017
Ready Player One," Spielberg Can Still Make The Popcorn Thriller
","At its heart, the story behind 'Ready Player One' is a popcorn cinema thriller just waiting to be made. After reading the book, I remember thinking that it could probably be even better as a film, considering it is easier to see/feel being inside a video game than it is reading about it. Director Steven Spielberg proves himself more than capable of handling both those fronts, proving he still has the chops to make a terrific popcorn flick, and also make it even better than the source material.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Parzival (Tye Sheridan), who spends most of his time (like most people of this future) inside the OASIS (think of it like a massive multiplay online game that everyone is hooked into). On an Earth that has been decimated by plagues and riots, with many residents living in vertical ghettos, this digital realm is the closest to happiness that most people can get. Halliday (Mark Rylance), the creator of OASIS, has left three clues scattered around (based on his childhood nostalgia) that will give the winner of his little game essentially the keys to the kingdom. So far, no one has been able to crack even the first code, and that includes a team of nefarious drone-types put together by Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). When Parzival, with the help of the mysterious Art3mis (Olivia Cooke), solves the first puzzle, it sets off a race to determine which faction will ultimately control OASIS.Like I said, this is perfect fodder for summer action/adventure movie fare, and Spielberg captures it all perfectly here. The action/chases are pulse-pounding, the visuals are engaging, and the entire film is littered with 'easter eggs', or callbacks to 70s/80s nostalgia. For anyone who grew up with that pop culture, this will be a real treat. Even younger viewers, however, should also still be interested in some of the technical concepts thrown around, while of course being amazed by just the sheer amount of things that transpire in every scene.Even more impressive? Spielberg's take on the material is better than the novel source, and I honestly don't think it is all that close of a contest. Ernest Cline's book had some great ideas, but spent far too much time moralizing about them in the 'real world'. Here, Spielberg realizes that the real meat of the story takes place inside the OASIS, and thus that is where most of the movie is set. This makes for a much more engaging experience, coupled with video games/film being easier to replicate visually than via the printed page.So, overall I was much more impressed by 'Ready Player One' than I ever thought I would be (it's one of the best purely exciting films I've seen in quite some time). After a run of more personal or politically-themed epic films, this one proves that Spielberg can slip right back into 'cool guy director' mode without a hitch!",9,1,2,30 July 2018
"I, Tonya"," Weird Presentation, But Fascinating Subject Matter
","Because of the attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan leading up to the 1994 Winter Olympics, Tonya Harding is largely a household name even to the most casual of sporting fans. What was her role in the attack? Did she help plan it? These are questions that may never definitively have answers. What 'I, Tonya' looks at, however, is the notion that Harding has perhaps been judged as much for her upbringing and 'redneck' personality as anything else.For a basic plot summary, this film is a bio (of sorts) of Harding (Margot Robbie). It really focuses on the relationship with her mother LaVona (Allison Janney) and on-again-off-again husband/boyfriend Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). Growing up without much formal education and pushed to focus on skating at a very young age, Tonya did not possess the princess-like grace of her competitors, much to her dismay as the scores would inevitably disappoint. Despite being perhaps the best technical skater of all time (landing the first triple axel in Olympic history), Tonya could not seem to truly grasp the status she thought she deserved. The film then delves into the infamous Kerrigan (Caitlin Carver) attack, and posits some theories on how exactly it all came together.What one must remember about 'I, Tonya' from the very beginning is that it is pieced together from interviews conducted with Harding herself and Gilooly. Harding tends to deflect blame to anyone else (mother, background, etc.), while Gilooly really puts much of the attack incident at the feet of his mysterious oddball friend Shawn (Paul Walter Hauser). This is pretty standard behavior (trying to as much blame others as take any sort of personal responsibility) for these types of situations.What this approach does net, however, is some interesting things to think about regarding Tonya that are indeed interesting to ponder. Her mother is a true piece of work, she indeed was very naive due to a lack of education, and it is demonstrated time and time again how both the professional skating administration and the media used her to shape and cultivate their own narratives. While the film doesn't (and rightly so) make the leap of excusing the attack on Kerrigan because of this, it does make one perhaps at least look at Harding in a different light. Perhaps she was not the 'monster' she was made out to be at the time.Robbie's performance as Tonya is incredible, and almost single-handedly makes the weird presentation of the film work. Personally, I prefer a more direct approach when dealing with a documentary subject, but 'I, Tonya' constantly breaks the fourth wall (talking directly to viewers) and often has a character narrating certain scenes from an outsider perspective even while the scene is transpiring in real time. It can be a bit jarring, to be sure, but as I said Robbie really mitigates that with her incredible Oscar-nominated performance.Overall, I enjoyed 'I, Tonya' much more than I probably ever thought I would do to how thought-provoking I found it. Will I ever completely sympathize with Ms. Harding? No. But what this film gave me was a look inside her life and how her tumultuous background may have colored both the events and relationships that eventually brought the skating portion of her life to an end.",8,1,1,24 January 2018
We Were Soldiers," The 'Saving Private Ryan' of Vietnam
","When Steven Spielberg released Saving Private Ryan in 1998, it set the new standard for epic war films. We Were Soldiers uses some of those same effects/devices to tell a compelling Vietnam War story.For a basic plot summary, We Were Soldiers tells the story of one of the first Vietnam battles. It follows the First Battalion, 7th Cavalry division through their training, deployment, and improbably 'victory' (depending on your perspective) in that seminal battle.Strangely, this film doesn't stand out much on its own accord (it doesn't do anything all that original). However, it does enough things right to make for a very enjoyable, emotional experience.Mel Gibson shines as the lead actor, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, whose primary goal is to bring 'his boys' back to the mainland alive. In fact, this is one of the best roles I've ever seen Gibson in, far better than the action-hero roles he often fancies himself in. The other members of the battalion are also well-cast and peppered with great actors.However, this film is at its best when it tugs at your heartstrings, which it does frequently. Whether it is the physical toughness of the soldiers in the field, or the mental grit of their wives/families back home, this movie really 'gets' the emotions of that time period. Plus, it really does a good job of foreshadowing the rest of the drawn-out conflict.Thus, whereas First Blood is best in my book at examining the mental torments of 'Nam, We Were Soldiers touches on those same emotions but also adds the epic battle scenes.",9,1,1,11 March 2017
The Adventures of Tintin," A Rollicking Adventure For The Kids (Or The Kid In All Of Us)
","Though not a movie I would usually be drawn too (it looked a bit unabashedly 'kiddie' for my tastes), it came highly recommend from a family member obsessed with Spielberg filmmaking. I gave it a try and, while it won't top any of my 'best-of' lists, it did provide a great deal of adventure, drama, action, and humor, pleasantly surprising me in the process.For a basic plot summary, 'Adventures of Tintin' focuses on the young Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell), a kind of Indiana Jones-type adventurer along with trusty sidekick dog Snowy. When young Tintin buys a model ship at an auction one day, he is suddenly thrust into a race for treasure involving a drunken sea captain (voice of Andy Serkis) and his nefarious foe (voice of Daniel Craig).I would say that the long-lasting effects of this film will be two-fold:First, I would still categorize it as very much a children's movie. It could probably best be described as 'Indiana Jones for the elementary set' in terms of its combination of all genre elements. Had I first viewed this film as a child, I know that I would have watched it again and again! For adults, of course, it also functions as escapism.Also, the somewhat controversial animation (is this middle ground needed between reality and Pixar-like animation?) is truly a sight to behold. I honestly am not any sort of expert on the subject and thus have no predictions for the future of the format, but the visuals are as top- notch as anything you'll see anywhere else. It is just...different.Overall, 'Adventures of Tintin' just seems like Spielberg's childhood epic. Perhaps the film can be appreciated even more if one has read the comic novel stories it is based on (I didn't even know about this until after the viewing!). On the whole, though, a very entertaining flick that makes for great family viewing.",7,2,3,6 March 2017
Ocean's Twelve," Still Manages To Keep You Guessing
","One of the reasons that the first 'Ocean's' movie was such a success was that it was full of 'Vegas Style' that really gave it an edge. While this second effort lacks that suave style, it still manages to be exciting and keeps you guessing until the very end.For a basic plot summary, 'Ocean's 12' begins with Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) wanting his money back. In order to come up with those kind of funds, the now-infamous thieving gang led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty (Brad Pitt) must take their act overseas and face off against a formidable foe in the burglary business. This time, however, Ocean's wife (played by Julia Roberts) has a bigger role in the proceedings.The reason this film manages to still hold up under the huge success of its predecessors is two- fold:1. The interplay between the characters is still excellent and quite funny. It must have been a hoot to film this one, as it sure seems as if all the main players had a great time with each other.2. The plot continues to move forward and never gets predictable or stale. It might not quite have the 'flash' of the first one, but it still is entertaining (especially as it gears up for the climax).Overall, 'Ocean's 12' is a solid (if less spectacular) follow-up to the glitzy original. A 3.5 star ranking would be more accurate, but it is closer to four stars than three.",6,2,3,8 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," This One Needs To Be Watched Last...Period
","Among the Star Wars community, the endless argument persists regarding the proper viewing order of all six films. After watching this installment just recently, however, it become very clear to me that 'Return of the Jedi' needs to be in that sixth slot due to the fact that it provides such a proper ending to the saga.For a basic plot summary, 'Jedi' focuses on two primary plots: the final 'all in' battle between the Rebels and the Empire, and the epic confrontation between father (Darth Vader) and son (Luke Skywalker).To be sure, there are some things that this movie struggles at: the Ewok characters are an odd choice, the Rebel battle is utterly predictable, and none of the auxiliary characters get much development. However, the Vader/Luke/Emperor scenes are so emotionally gripping and intense that they more than make up for any lag elsewhere. I consider those scenes to be the best of the entire saga (and that includes the incredible ending of 'Revenge of the Sith'). You will be cheering, crying, thinking, and remembering all in the span of minutes.Thus, I firmly believe that 'Return of the Jedi' is the film that definitively ends the epic saga. Everything comes together in an emotionally gripping finale that closes out perhaps the most incredible film series ever created. George Lucas makes a few questionable moves here and there, but what he does right far outdoes anything else.",9,1,1,11 March 2017
Knocked Up," Extremely Crude...But With Heart
","The best way to describe 'Knocked Up' is this: If a movie like 'Superbad' actually had a shred of dramatic integrity (e.g. 'a point') to add to its crude, sometimes gross-out antics, you'd have this comedy.For a basic plot summary, 'Knocked Up' sees stoner Ben (Seth Rogen) and straight-laced Allison (Katherine Heigl) hook up during a drunken one-night stand. When Allison finds out that she is pregnant, she must decide not only what to do about her 'situation', but also try to include Ben in the process.To be very frank, this is one of the crudest movies ever made, filled with gross-out images, a boatload of profanity, and sexual zingers at literally almost every turn. If these are things that you are uncomfortable with, then turn the other way and run right now!At the same time, 'Knocked Up' does have one key attribute that most of its contemporaries lack: heart. When you wade through all the stoner jokes, sexual innuendo, and the like, you actually get a story that you might just find yourself caring about. It touches on a variety of different marital/relationship themes, and the tremendous acting of Heigl/Rogen helps to add a legitimate emotional dynamic to the proceedings.Basically, 'Knocked Up' is Judd Apatow's pulling together of the traditional romantic comedy and the stoner/goofball genre, a pairing that one would think wouldn't work all that well. It does in this case, though, because the overall effort is taken seriously enough to produce a perfect mix of well-crafted jokes from all areas of life. Unless you are turned off by the crudeness, you will be both laughing at and caring about the characters in this movie.",8,2,2,5 March 2017
Alien," Depends On Your POV
","There is no question that Ridley Scott's 'Alien' is a landmark film in the history of science fiction cinema. However, your overall enjoyment of the film will likely depend on whether or not you can fling yourself back to the late 1970s.For a basic plot summary, 'Alien' sees the crew of a future commercial spaceship stumble upon an alien creature so horrifying that it defies description. After worming its way aboard the ship, the grotesque alien proceeds to wreak havoc on vessel and crew alike.Put simply, there are two primary trains of thought regarding the greatness of this movie (both of which include strains of the truth):1. As a stand-alone film, the movie isn't all that great. There is no context, no character development, and the 'landscape' (while perhaps creative in its sparseness) is quite bleak. The special effects are also quite dated, and (in retrospect) the plot has now been done so many times in so many different forms that it has almost become a cliché of itself.2. Despite lacking in overall plot and effects, 'Alien' does (without a doubt) contain some of the most seminal scenes in cinema history. It was (to my knowledge) the first film to really perfect the 'killing-machine space organism' plot line and bring it to the mainstream. Plus, the scenes with the alien that are now so well-known are still shocking/provocative all these years later. If you saw this movie in the theaters in 1979, you were likely blown away by it.Thus, very likely your overall impression of this movie will be determined by whether or not you can suspend time for about two hours. If judged by today's standards, this movie falls a bit flat. However, if seen in the context of its contemporaries, it is truly groundbreaking.",5,1,2,8 March 2017
The Polar Express," Can You Think LIke A Child?
","Are you able to put yourself into the mindset of a young child while watching a movie? Your answer to that question will likely determine your interest level in a film that has (in the ten years since its release) become a popular entry into the 'holiday pantheon' of film.For a basic plot summary, 'The Polar Express' follows the adventures of a young boy who is doubting the existence of Santa Claus. When, on Christmas Eve, a mysterious train destined for the North Pole pulls up in front of his house, the boy is taken on a journey that may just change his opinion on the holiday season forever.'Polar Express' is an odd, quirky movie to be sure (though not necessarily in a bad way). Tom Hanks is the voice of darn near every character, it is done in the same animation style as 'Adventures of the Tin-Tin', and it uses a kind of charge-ahead storytelling vibe that calls for some crazy action/adventure at practically every turn.The main determinant of whether you'll like the movie, though, is how able you will be to completely transforming yourself (while viewing) into the psyche of that young boy. To me, this movie wasn't quite good enough for me to get emotionally invested, so it ended up being just 'okay'. If you can better mentally regress to that target age, however, than the enjoyment factor will rise tenfold!Overall, 'The Polar Express' is a well-made film that, if all else fails for you, will at least be a unique experience. For me it is no Christmas classic, but it may just touch your emotions a bit more.",5,2,3,5 March 2017
Suicide Squad," The Right Idea, But Still Not That Good
","DC had the right idea with 'Suicide Squad'. They really did. Instead of the plodding seriousness of films like 'Man of Steel' or 'Batman vs. Superman', this one was meant to let loose and have a little fun. While it did accomplish that goal, unfortunately it just isn't a very good film, overall.For a basic plot summary, 'Suicide Squad' sees government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) put together a team of mercenaries to do some dirty work so that the government won't have to get it's own hands dirty. Ostensibly led by Deadshot (Will Smith) and prominently featuring Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), this group of ragtag 'bad guys' tries to thwart a plan hatched by the evil Enchantress (Cara Delavigne). Lurking on the fringes of everything? The Joker (Jared Leto), stirring up trouble everywhere he goes.There is a lot of fun to be had in this movie (especially during the first half of runtime). Director David Ayer creates a wacky, madcap atmosphere with all the crazy pieces falling into place, and it really is a lot of fun. Smith has the perfect personality for Deadshot, while Robbie's Quinn is easily the best thing to come out of the whole experience. Leto's Joker is engaging, and just the entire concept is fresh and new.Sadly, things take a real nosedive after that solid first half. As soon as a plot needs to be introduced, the whole thing falls apart. Maybe the saddest part of the whole ordeal? They seemed to be very correctable mistakes that just weren't identified and fixed. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I can't go too deep into what I felt were late-film mistakes, but the biggest faux pas for me was that the tenor of certain characters really changed from beginning to end. Not helping matters is that there isn't anything resembling the word 'deep' in the whole movie. So, basically, as soon as things have to start making sense and adding up...they don't.I really wish I could give 'Suicide Squad' a higher rating than this (2.5 stars would be my exact mark), but I just can't because, as a whole, it doesn't deserve it. It establishes an interesting Joker, an incredible Harley, and has a bit of fun in the first half...but that isn't enough to make it a great film. I know that rumors of studio meddling plagued this project until practically up to the release date, so perhaps that had a lot to do with why the tone seemed to change so much at times and why the characterizations seemed a bit off from beginning to end.The final verdict: If Leto's Joker, Robbie's Quinn, and Affleck's Batman were to have a movie to themselves (with perhaps Smith's Deadshot lurking in the corners), that would be something to get excited about. Everything else in 'Suicide Squad' is either a total miss or decidedly lukewarm.",3,1,1,26 February 2017
Elf," Will Ferrell Creates Iconic Christmas Character
","Like most people around the holidays, I'm usually up for a watching (or re-watching) of the great holiday classics ('Wonderful Life', 'Home Alone', etc.). For whatever reason, however, it took me until 2016 to actually sit down and watch 'Elf' all the way through. While maybe not jumping up to the top of my 'all-time Christmas list', I did find Elf to be an enjoyable romp.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Buddy (Ferrell), a human boy raised in the North Pole due to a mix-up with Santa Claus (Ed Asner). For most of his life, Buddy believes he is an actual elf, until realizing his shortcomings in that community. As such, he decides to strike out for the 'human world' in order to find his real father (James Caan). Along the way, Buddy (as a result of his endearing cheerfulness) brings a bit of Christmas spirit to all those around him that are in dire need of it, including a young retail worker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).To me, 'Elf' is primarily a success because of the iconic character that Ferrell creates. The script/plot itself is about as irrelevant and corny as they come, but Ferrell's quirky energy steals every single scene. Quotes like 'You sit on a throne of lies', 'Bye buddy, hope you find your Dad!', and 'Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?' will forever be burned into my memory! I don't think there is an actor out there who could have played Buddy as perfectly as Ferrell.Simply put, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched 'Elf' from beginning to end. I don't know if it will get watched religiously every Christmas in my home (time will tell on that one...but maybe it will grow on me even more!), but I can tell you that I will be quoting it going forward!",7,2,2,27 February 2017
Shutter Island," So Much More Than The 'Surprise Ending' Movie Advertised
","By and large, I am a huge fan of films in the same genre of Shutter Island (thriller; big surprise at the end). A few of my favorites that come to mind are The Sixth Sense, The Others, and Identity. Shutter Island should, by all means, have had the same effect on me, but one key detail got in the way: the way the film was advertised.For a basic plot summary, this film opens with a missing-persons investigation on Shutter Island, which houses the most dangerous mental asylum in the world. Detective Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) leads the investigation, and begins to discover that there is a lot more to Shutter Island than what meets the eye. I can't tell you any more out of fear of loosing major spoilers.In terms of overall plot and acting, this film is excellent in nearly every sense. The mood is creepy, the acting is competent, and the plot throws you for multiple loops along the way before going for the KO in the final minutes. It is also one of those movies where it takes a little bit of time for all the themes to sink in. About an hour after viewing (or once my mind had finished sifting through things), I actually appreciated it more than while the credits were rolling.However, the major problem with this film lies (sadly) in the way it was advertised. While watching those thriller classics I listed in the opening, I had absolutely no idea they would end with a huge twist, thus giving it all the more punch when it did occur. Shutter Island, though, was advertised as having 'the biggest mind-blowing ending ever' (or something to that extent), and thus during the entire viewing I was guessing at what could REALLY be going on. Thus, while the ending was still shocking, it was already one of the many possible conclusions running through my head while the DVD was spinning, leading to less of a surprise. Perhaps I was just smart enough to figure things out, but I doubt it (!). I'm guessing that many attentive viewers went in with the same thought-processes as me, and maybe found themselves a bit underwhelmed by the ending for the same reason.Thus, while Shutter Island is still an excellent addition to the 'Thriller' genre, I would have appreciated it if they would have advertised it as a straight-forward cop drama, THEN thrown in the twist. Of course, the marketing crew likely played up the surprise ending to get butts in the seats, but for those thinking-viewers among us, it kind of cheapens the experience.Update (7/1/17): After a recent re-watch of 'Shutter Island', I moved it from 7 stars to 9 stars. For whatever reason, this was a movie almost solely advertised on the premise of its 'tricky ending', and thus my first viewing of it came through that lens (I was constantly trying to out- guess the proceedings). 'Shutter Island' is so much deeper and more nuanced than that, though, and a viewing without the hype helps that tremendously. This really is an excellent film no matter how one slices it.",9,1,2,12 March 2017
Over the Top," Pure Cheeseball Drama
","I have watched a lot of movies over the years, and I can easily say that this one is easily the cheesiest, sappiest, most 'over-the-top' (pun very much intended) film I have ever made it all the way through.For a basic plot summary, 'Over The Top' focuses on an uncultured trucker named Lincoln Hawk (Sylvester Stallone) trying to win custody of his stuck-up son Michael (David Mendenhall) from Michael's ruthless, and filthy rich grandfather (Robert Loggia). In order to show the means to support the young boy, Hawk risks everything on his arm-wrestling skills in trying to win the grand prize of the national competition.Yep, seriously, that is the plot of this movie. It is so cheesy that I almost wonder if it wasn't meant to be taken seriously in the first place. It is so sappy that adults with an emotional intellect above a fifth grade level will laugh at the contrived drama and soap opera-ish acting from all participants. In fact, this movie will actually be more enjoyed by action-oriented young children than any other demographic, as they will be completely sucked in by the one-dimensional and straightforward drama.Thus, while this may be a movie to watch with your young son, it really doesn't serve any other dramatic or entertainment purpose. Either watch it just to enjoy the cheese, or prepare to put your eyes on 'perpetual roll'.",4,1,4,11 March 2017
Ocean's Thirteen," Probably Good That This Is The Last One
","'Ocean's Thirteen' is not a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. It is entertaining at its core and even goes back to the Vegas locale that made the first one so successful. However, by the end of '13' it is clear that the 'Ocean's' series has played itself out.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Danny Ocean (George Clooney), Rusty (Brad Pitt), and the rest of the gang (this time featuring Matt Damon in a much larger role) back in Vegas, where this time they are getting a little revenge on casino owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) for putting Reuben (Elliot Gould) in the hospital.The biggest 'plus' about this film is that it goes back to Vegas, the setting that these kinds of movies need to feature. Even when all else can (and sometimes does) go wrong, there is just something about seeing those suave guys in sharp clothing strutting around the casino floor. It adds that 'cool' factor.Unfortunately, '13' is kind of a mishmash of all kinds of different stuff, both plot and character- wise. The 'big job' is delved into much too quickly with very little 'setup' (a key component of the original), while the characters become (for the first time) little more than parodies of themselves. Everything just kind of feels rushed in this one, as if the plan was to camouflage a fading series with continued action instead of plot/character development.Overall, though, 'Ocean's 13' is still entertaining, at least. If you liked the first two at all you'll have no trouble sitting through this one. However, it won't grab you and take you for a fun ride like the others, either.",5,1,1,8 March 2017
Tangled," A Lot Of Heart (And Hair!) In This One
","The hallmark of Disney animated films (at least of late) has always been their ability to combine humor with heart to produce an entrancing concoction of family entertainment. Simply put, 'Tangled' succeeds once again in that vein.For a basic plot summary, 'Tangled' tells the basic story of Rapunzel...but with a more modern feel to it. Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) lives in a tower with Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and forbidden to leave. One day, however, the dashing young Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) happens upon the castle and changes Rapunzel's life forever.Humor-wise, this flick will have young and old alike laughing out loud. Since it is told from the modern perspective (e.g. Rapunzel acts like a current teenager, nothing is 'stuffy' about the tale, etc.), there is plenty of room for conversational humor and sight gags galore.Also, a very interesting animation choice produces big results: the decision to make the characters' faces/eyes as wide/expressive as possible. The film is already a visual treat (Blu-Ray highly recommended), but the emotion (and this movie is full of it) strikes a real chord in large part because of those facial features.Overall, I very much enjoyed 'Tangled' and would highly recommend it to fans of similar Disney or other animated fare. For years I skipped this effort because I thought it little more than a 'girls movie', but when watching it with my younger sister it was ME getting emotional...not her!",9,4,4,4 March 2017
We Are Marshall," A MUST WATCH For All Sports (Especially Football) Fans
","At its core, this film tells the story of the Marshall College football program of 1971, when a year earlier nearly the entire team was wiped out in a plane crash and thus the entire team had to be rebuilt. Sadly, this is a true story, and this film is able to capture the essence of the entire story in two ways:First, not only is the building of the football team extremely difficult, but more importantly was the rebuilding of the community after the tragedy, and director McG captured that emotional period brilliantly, showing how members of the school and community grappled with the issue of putting a team on the field (and risk dredging up bad memories) or scrapping the football program altogether. While some people yearn to see the green and white colors on the playing field, others are haunted by those memories and would prefer to keep them at an arms length, the conflict that provides the emotional punch to the film.Just as important, however, is the quality of the acting. Matthew McConaughey breaks away from his traditional 'brainless' or 'hunk' movie roles to portray Coach Jack Lengyl, who brought football back to Marshall. McConaughey nails this role, bringing the enigmatic coach to life. Also impressive is Kata Mara in the role of Annie Cantrell, whose personal struggles mirror the struggles of the entire community. However, it is Matthew Fox ('Jack' of LOST fame) who really steals the show. Playing a Marshall coach not on the doomed plane, Fox is brilliant in portraying the conflicting emotions (relief, sorrow, regret, anger, guilt, etc.) that arise from such a complicated, emotional situation. It has been a long time since I have seen an actor be so good at playing emotionally conflicted characters.Overall, this is a very inspirational, yet also quite sorrowful film that will take you on an emotional roller-coaster. Yet, even in its most emotional moments, there always seems to exist a light at the end of the tunnel, or a way that things can start to be okay after such a tragedy. Though you likely already know how the situation turned out, that knowledge will not stop you for rooting on the Marshall boys all the same!",10,2,2,12 March 2017
Interstellar," A Tale Of The Human Spirit
","'Interstellar' is a movie about a lot of different things: Exploring the cosmos, family, future stability of planet Earth, time-travel, and science ethics in general. Perhaps most importantly, though, 'Interstellar' is about something much more important that hasn't been listed yet: the depth of the human spirit.For a basic plot summary, 'Interstellar' is the story of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a farmer in Earth's future. He isn't a farmer by trade, but rather out of necessity, as in this film's future Earth is perilously close to running out of food, and thus all workers (starting even in the school system) are assigned an occupation based on needs rather than wants. At heart, Cooper is an engineer who loves tinkering with things and dreams of 'something bigger' than the dust-patch he currently resides on. One day, through a chance series of events, Cooper is introduced to Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a fellow dreamer who has concocted a scheme to leave Earth and settle on a new home. The catch? A trip through an intergalactic wormhole is required, which hasn't ever quite been done successfully. So, saddling up with Brand (Anne Hathaway), the professor's daughter, Coop volunteers for the mission, leaving behind his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet), to await his promised return.After walking out of the theater upon this film's conclusion, the first thought that struck me was 'Wow...that movie had it all'. I don't know if I've ever seen a film so ambitiously tackle so many areas and yet manage to follow through successfully on all of them. I don't care who you are or where you come from...there is something in this flick that will appeal to you.Usually, I am wary of film's like this, as all too often they 'bite off more than they can chew' and in trying to tackle everything end up doing nothing completely successful. That all changes, however, with Christopher Nolan behind the camera, backed up by brother Jonathan Nolan writing the screenplay. There hasn't been a thing that the Nolan Bros. have worked on that hasn't been utterly fantastic in both scope and execution. In this case, they reach for the stars (in quite a literal sense!) and get there.'Interstellar' is also a film I would highly recommended seeing in the largest and clearest possible format. I saw a special showing in IMAX 75mm film, and it was extraordinary. The best part? The visuals are not distractions from the overall plot (again, cue the Nolans here). This isn't a 'look pretty but have little substance' flick (I'm looking at you, 'Gravity'). The visuals (and even the Hans Zimmer score) perfectly compliment the plot/characters.But this film's brilliance doesn't end with a great story or stunning visuals. Great characters provide the emotional drama of any story, and 'Interstellar' has those in spades. McConaughey gives perhaps the best performance I've ever seen from him. You'd never know he was once mocked as 'king of the rom-com'. Nolan 'vets' Caine ('The Prestige', 'Batman Trilogy') & Hathaway (Catwoman in 'Dark Knight Rises) also are spot-on in their respective roles. Jessica Chastain (playing a role that I can't discuss much for fear of spoilers!) just continues to build her career that was put in motion by a powerful 'Zero Dark Thirty' performance. At times, even child actor Foy can steal the show with her emotional range. A true gem of a cast, to say the least.As I mentioned earlier, though, perhaps the greatest feat of 'Interstellar' is its ability to tell a story that will touch your very spirit. Human beings are, by our very nature, curious beings (being gifted with the most advanced brain of any being found in the universe...at least so far) and thus explorers. The 'Space Race' of the 1960s fed off that instinct, and Nolan capitalizes on it in this film. While by no means being a 'rah rah' type of film (every character is very grounded with human faults as well), 'Interstellar' does strike a chord when it comes to the human spirit and the power it can possess.When the Academy Awards start gearing up later this year, I truly hope that 'Interstellar' and its cast/crew are richly rewarded for their superb efforts all around. This is easily the most stirring experience I had watching a movie in 2014, and I have a feeling it will last for quite some time as well.So, if you are looking for a movie that sets its scope as high as humanly possible and pretty much obtained the goal, 'Interstellar' is for you. I could continue to go on and on about the things it did well, but it can also be boiled down to one thing: it will make you FEEL on so many different levels. When was the last time a movie made you care so deeply about the characters/circumstances in such a deep, 'human' way that you felt like you were right beside them? If it's been awhile since you've seen a movie that fits those requirements, then 'Interstellar' will be a special treat.",10,2,5,4 March 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Odd Tone Sometimes, But More Often Than Not Has Interesting Things To Say
","I honestly cannot say I've ever seen a film take on such different tones during its runtime as 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri'. One moment you'll be chuckling; the next crying...often within the same scene, in all honesty. This certainly makes it unique and gives it the ability to 'stand out from the crowd'. Does it make it an all-time classic? I would say no. But it is certainly interesting and worth watching, as it feels relevant for the times in which it was made.For a basic plot summary, 'Three Billboards' tells the story of Mildred (Frances McDormand), a woman whose daughter was raped and murdered and the local police department, led by Sheriff Willoughby (Woody Harrelson), has yet to make any arrests or really have any leads at all. As a result, Mildred puts up a series of three billboards in her town of Ebbing, MO, which call out the local police force for essentially not doing their jobs. Predictably, this causes a stir among the small town, and Mildred must try to weather the storm of criticism that comes with such an act.What made this movie work for me was the fact that it contained some great character development pretty much across the board. For example, a police officer played by Sam Rockwell seems pretty much irrideemable for most of the film, yet in the end becomes almost sympathetic. This film establishes a set of characters in the opening minutes, and then almost completely changes all of their characterizations over the course of the runtime. I have a lot of respect for a film that can effectively do this.That being said, I almost wish that 'Three Billboards' had played things a little bit straighter, or like a more conventional drama. Sure, the dark humor and sometimes very odd character interactions (especially towards the beginning of the film) makes it stand out, but I felt that it also was a bit distracting in terms of the overall message. At its core, this seems like a very emotional, heartfelt film with a message to get across. Can that effectively be done even with the black humor? It can. But could it have been even more moving had it played it straighter? My answer to that would be yes.Overall, though, 'Three Billboards' is a solid film that is never boring, and will be a bit different than anything you've seen in quite some time. That alone will give it above-average marks from me. I'm not sure this one will stand the test of time, but it plays well in the current social setting, and I guess that is all it can be judged on for now.",7,2,2,5 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Supremely Entertaining, If A Bit Rushed/Overburdened
","Walking out of the theater after seeing 'The Rise of Skywalker', I was almost giddy with happiness. J.J. Abrams had brought Star Wars back after the failure of 'The Last Jedi'! After a week of letting the film percolate in my mind a bit and reading some other thoughts/reviews, the film has settled downward a bit. It is so supremely entertaining that I would never give it a lower rating than 8/10 stars, but at the same time it is so jam-packed with things to accomplish that there just isn't time to let all the material play out as it should. That, more than any specific writing/character decision, is why I have to drop it down a few stars from the 'solid 10' I gave it as the credits rolled.For a very basic overview, 'The Rise of Skywalker' sees the return of an old, thought to be long-dead antagonist in the form of the Sith Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). After first being visited by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), eventually the heroes of the new trilogy--Rey (Daisey Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac)--pick up the scent and must try to snuff out this new threat that could represent the end of the Resistance.Plot-wise, there is very little I disagreed with in this film. It's a rousing adventure, to be sure, and a fitting end to the nine-movie saga. I especially enjoyed the cultivation of the notion that one's bloodline does not represent who they are in the Star Wars universe anymore, and that's a concept I really like (especially how it mirrors the end of the overall saga). When Rey disavows her Palpatine heritage and declares herself a Skywalker of her own accord, that seems to be the moment the entire third trilogy was building toward.That being said, once the initial excitement of the theater experience wore off, I found there to be some issues with the way certain points were handled. A few examples:-The Palpatine character was rushed...plain and simple. What could have been an epic tease falls a little flat in the execution, especially when he is introduced in the opening crawl rather than at some point later on where his presence could truly be appreciated.
-Besides the beginning and the end of the picture, Driver's Ren is only a bit player in the proceedings. One could argue him being the most unique character to come from this entire trilogy, so it was a bit odd to see him cast aside for much of its conclusion.
-Rey's final confrontation with the Emperor even feels a bit underdone in execution. How epic would it have been to have seen some Force-ghosts of, say, Annakin, Obi-Wan, Qui-Gonn, or Yoda instead of just hearing their voices? The same could even be said for Palpatine's Sith background. Nothing wrong with the overall concept, but that moment could have been so much more.Of course, it certainly doesn't help that this film spends a good deal of its time course-correcting after the embarrassment that was 'The Last Jedi'. That second film of this trilogy may have had some interesting ideas, to be sure, but director Rian Johnson had absolutely no idea how to execute them. Because of this, much of the pleasure here is seeing how they subtly (or sometimes not-so-subtly) get the franchise back to more traditional Star Wars fare (the approach I tend to enjoy in these films). When ghost-Luke tells Rey 'that is no way to treat a Jedi weapon', I almost stood and applauded. Unfortunately, it just isn't good practice in any trilogy to have such wild swings in tone. I truly feel like having one director (JJ or otherwise) all the way through would have been a much better choice.So, I guess my final word (at least at the moment) on 'Rise of Skywalker' is this: it absolutely thrilled me as I sat in my theater seat, so that counts for something. The action/adventure was thrilling, the character/plot decisions were fine, and I very much enjoyed the overall message trying to be conveyed. At the same time, it was burdened by the weight of it's predecessor, the weight of trying to put an amen to the most culturally-known film franchise perhaps of all-time, and the weight of a fast-tracked production schedule. Oh yeah, and the legacy character (Princess Leia) they originally wanted to build the whole thing around? Sadly, Carrie Fisher passed before that could become a reality. In hindsight, I wonder if delaying this film by, say, a year would have produced a slightly better result?Through all this, I settled on 8 stars because I gave 9 to 'The Force Awakens' and still consider that one the best of the contemporary trilogy. 'Rise' (thanks to Abrams) captures much of that film's energy, but it isn't as free to pursue it in the most open, creative way possible. In terms of trilogy-enders, 'Rise' is a bit behind 'Return of the Jedi' and 'Revenge of the Sith'.",8,8,16,29 December 2019
American Sniper," A Film About Many Things (But PTSD Is What Truly Stands Out)
","While settling into my theater seat to view 'American Sniper', I had about as high of expectations as any movie I'd seen in the past year. Rarely do those type of expectations ever get lived up to these days, it seems. That was emphatically NOT the case with this film, however, as it captivated me from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary (minor spoilers), 'American Sniper' focuses on the life of Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper), who serves multiple terms in Iraq during the early 2000s while wife Taya (Sienna Miller) dutifully waits for him on the homefront with each deployment. Over in Iraq, Chris is an expert sniper, tasked with providing air support and protecting 'his guys' from any number of unforeseen calamities (a scene where a young Iraqi boy begins to pick up an explosive device is particular telling on what mental torture Chris's job can be at times). Because, Chris doesn't want to leave until the 'job is done', he's a little bit less himself every single time he returns stateside. This puts particular strain on wife Taya and a growing family that Chris does not know how to integrate back into.One could almost say that 'American Sniper' is two movies in one...First, it is a taut psychological spectacle of the type of warfare that was being conducted in Iraq. A sniper from the opposition is nearly Kyle's equal, while a notorious 'Butcher' commits atrocities that begin to wear on Kyle's mental faculties. To me, this was the 'weaker' portion of the film (though to call it 'weak' would be a travesty), but that's likely because I don't have first- hand experience in that type of environment. It was all kind of surreal to me. A number of people in the group I saw the movie with thought these war/sniping scenes were the best part, so it was probably just personal preference.Secondly, and to me this is where the flick can go down in history, are Kyle's struggles with post- traumatic stress disorder. Each time he returns back to Taya and the family, he is a little bit less himself, and even a bit more anxious to be back to the battlefield. I was utterly fascinated (and quite more than a bit proud) by how a man can voluntarily put himself into harm's way in order to finish the war at hand and have the back of his fellow soldier. These are the scenes where director Clint Eastwood really excels. He knows exactly how to prod the emotions and then get out of the way so as not to seem preachy.So, for me, 'American Sniper' made my 'top films' list because I've never seen a war film tackle the issue of PTSD so brutally. Usually, a soldier returning home will say something like 'I saw some things over there' and that's all that will be said. Here, however, the PTSD is actually experienced in chilling fashion.If Bradley Cooper doesn't get serious consideration for his outstanding performance as Chris Kyle, it would be a crying shame. The auxiliary cast is good as well, but Cooper is almost literally front and center in every meaningful scene or exchange in the picture. He'd certainly get my vote for 'Best Actor' to get a gold Oscar, that is for sure.Overall, 'American Sniper' is one of those films that is tough to 'like' even though it is truly a gem. The reason being? It is so hard-hitting. The story of Chris Kyle and his family is one that resonates in this day and age, while Eastwood was the perfect choice to get the most out of it. If you want an insight into many aspects of being a soldier that you had likely never thought of before, 'American Sniper' is the film to watch.",8,12,16,1 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Everything A Star Wars Movie Should Be
","All too often, the middle installment of any trilogy gets a bad rap. Part One usually lays the foundation, while Part Three delivers the goods, leaving Part Two to just 'continue the story'. Luckily, 'Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones' manages to turn in an effort worthy of the Star Wars moniker.For a basic plot summary, 'Attack of the Clones' tells the story of how the Clone Army came to be, and prefaces the very beginnings of the great war that ultimately divides the galaxy. Moving forward from the events of 'Phantom Menace', Annakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) is significantly older and under the tutelage of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor). The traitorous Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is still scheming for more power, Padme (Natalie Portman) begins a dalliance with the young Skywalker, and the Jedi Republic continues to become more fractured in the face of adversity.What makes this movie is success is that, besides just keeping the storyline moving forward, it also throws in some compelling scenes and subplots to really suck the viewer in. For instance:-Annakin returning to Tatooine to look for his mother.-Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) wielding a lightsaber as never before!-The introduction of the Fett 'family'.-The foreshadowing of serious trouble in the Jedi Republic, with the seeds of discontent now sown and beginning to take root.Thus, I consider 'Attack of the Clones' to be one of the better installments in the Star Wars series. It has everything a movie of its kind needs: action, adventure, romance, drama, foreshadowing, and even some humor (although with less Jar-Jar Binks, which is always a plus...!).Watch with confidence knowing that, upon this episode's conclusion, you will be ready for the 'final chapter' of the prequel trilogy.",9,3,4,11 March 2017
Romeo + Juliet," Chemistry Between Principals Makes This Watchable
","Back in ninth grade English class, our teacher showed us this movie after we read William Shakespeare's famous play. The film made an impression on me back then, and I wanted to see what would happen 15 years later. It isn't an all-time classic, to be sure, but 'Romeo + Juliet' does manage to render the tale in a bit more of a user-friendly format.For a basic plot summary, this movie uses the exact language of Shakespeare's play...but sets it in a modern, urban environment. Romeo (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Juliet (Claire Danes) are the principles, of course, while Harold Perrineau & John Leguizamo have important roles as Mercutio and Tybalt, respectively.What makes this film hold up at least somewhat are the performances by DiCaprio & Danes. They are perfect for their roles and have great on-screen chemistry. Both ended up being fine thespians, so in hindsight this should not have been surprising. Many fans of the Romeo & Juliet story laud the 1968 version as 'top dog', but IMHO the two principles here, at least, put up performances every bit as good as from the earlier effort.The reason this one isn't an all-time classic? The direction from Baz Luhrmann is just too weird. I don't understand why they couldn't have kept the urban, modern feel without making things so bizarre. The duels between the houses are terribly over-the-top, while I've never once understood why viewers need to see Mercutio prance around in drag for so long. Even the camera work and cinematography is odd/bizarre. Had they toned down that craziness a bit, this could have rocketed higher for me. As it was, like I mentioned earlier, I really only enjoyed the Romeo/Juliet interactions.Overall, 'Romeo + Juliet' is good for showing reluctant Shakespearean 'scholars' (e.g. high- schoolers), but other than that it is decidedly average. DiCaprio and Danes give it their all, but all the weird stuff going on around them really detracts from the passion of the story. If only they had played it just slightly more serious...",5,2,2,2 March 2017
Forrest Gump," One Man's Journey
","When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, 'Forrest Gump' has to be near the top of that list. Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor. There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with 'Gump'.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the life story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the 'scale of normal', falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department. However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart- turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple man, has touched so many others.There are two primary reasons why 'Forrest Gump' will resonate through the ages:First, is the Gump character himself. Not only did it rocket Tom Hanks to super stardom, but it is one of the greatest representations of life ever put on the big screen. Even though Forrest is obviously 'slow', he has qualities about him that we all wish we could mimic. He doesn't get caught up in the 'b.s.' of life, instead just taking things at face value and living life in the moment. As a result, he has a knack for showing up at the right place at the right time. Sometimes, we get so caught up in the minutiae of our everyday lives that we forget to just 'live'...something Forrest does like no other.Secondly, this movie is a reflection of its times. I think there are so many baby boomers who, like Jenny, thought that counter-culture (drugs, hippies, etc.) was the best route into adulthood. What many of them realized, however, was that such behavior could not last forever, and eventually you have to come back to reality. In this case, Jenny has a Forrest to come back to, which provides the primary drama of the film.Overall, 'Forrest Gump' is a landmark effort in cinema, as it is one of the only movies that can still hold up perfectly despite being only about 'the journey', so to speak. It can be watched by viewers of pretty much all ages and enjoyed on some level. The film is on television so much these days that sometimes it gets a little over-exposed, but it still remains a special piece of filmmaking.",10,3,4,4 March 2017
"Monsters, Inc."," Laughs + Heart = Fun
","Disney/Pixar movies always work best on the 'funny + heart' formula. 'Monsters, Inc.', while not absolutely perfecting that formula, works well enough to produce another solid animation effort.For a basic plot summary, this movie poses that the 'monster in the closet' you were scared of as a kid was indeed real and just trying to scare you to collect your screams, which powers their entire industry. One 'routine day at the Monster scare factory', however, top scare-er Sulley (John Goodman) and pal Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) bring a small girl back into their own world, wreaking havoc along the way and learning a pretty valuable lesson in the process.To be sure, 'Monsters, Inc.' is a great animation effort. It is witty (for both adults and children), full of action/adventure, and has a lot of heart/emotions weaved into the proceedings. Especially standing out here is the voice acting from Crystal and Goodman, whose characters have such a great report with each other.The only reason I give the movie four stars instead of five is because, unlike the top tier of Disney/Pixar efforts like Toy Story, Wall-E, Finding Nemo, and Up, this one shies away from the take-home message when it could have embraced it. For example, and I'll try to be as spoiler- free as possible here, towards the end of the movie the two leads make a discovery (which is hinted at throughout the film) that will change the 'Monster world' forever. Instead of really delving into the consequences of that revelation, however, the producers choose to 'keep things simple' and not get too deep. I think they could have gone a little deeper and doing so would have vaulted this one into the upper echelon.Overall, though, 'Monsters, Inc.' is a fun film that the entire family can enjoy. While it may not be the absolute best of its kind, it is still easily better than most.",8,1,2,6 March 2017
Southpaw," Has All The Necessary Clichés, But None Of The Necessary Character Development
","Despite the fact that boxing really hasn't been all that relevant for quite some time, boxing movies (or 'fight movies' in general) are a favorite of mine. I count the 'Rocky' series, 'The Champ', 'Real Steel', 'The Fighter', and 'Warrior' to be some of my favorite films of all-time. The reason? Boxing movies really aren't about boxing. They are about revealing character. There may not be a more straightforward sport: hit the other person repeatedly until him or you can't continue. Yet, it is through that ferocious simplicity that great character stories can be told and relationship examined. Sadly, 'Southpaw' doesn't do nearly a good enough job with that character/relationship-building, instead just content to throw out all the old boxing clichés and hope they meld into something inspirational. They do not.For a basic plot summary, 'Southpaw' tells the story of Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal), a light- heavyweight champion at the top of his game. He has beaten all-comers, has a beautiful wife (Rachel McAdams), and a lovely daughter (Oona Laurence). The only problem? Billy can't walk away from any fight (in OR out of the ring) and it leads to a brawl in which a great tragedy befalls him and his family. Starting over basically from square one, Billy finds a new trainer in Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) and begins to rebuild both his own life and that of his newly-shaped family.Despite my earlier praise for the 'fight movie' genre, many of its movies do use rather predictable clichés when dealing with the actual boxing portion of the flicks. In 'Southpaw', every single one of those clichés is used in order to try and create a large amount of drama. There is the riches-to-rags-and-back-again story, the grizzled old trainer with the odd methods, the fracturing of the family life due to a violent sport, and the corruption of the entire business. Heck, 'Southpaw' even rips off the old 'Rocky IV' sequence of having interspersed shots of two boxing training with different styles...this time just set to an Eminem rap tune instead of a score.Unfortunately, all those clichés do is cover up for the fact that the characters in this movie are not well-written or well-conceived whatsoever, and the plot adds absolutely nothing new to the genre. It is completely hollow once you look past the surface material. Sadder still, there really isn't even anything that I can point to as being really good about the film, besides perhaps the acting of Gyllenhaal (which itself is even 'just okay' as there is no dramatic meat for him to work with). To be honest, a more accurate rating of this film for me would be 1.5 stars. I'll round it up to two stars because it at least as some coherency to it, but that is truly the only reason. Nothing else made me care about what I was seeing.I was very disappointed in 'Southpaw', as (when I first saw its trailers a few months ago) I predicted it would be perhaps the best movie I've seen all year. Boy, was that ever a 'punch to the gut' (pardon the pun). Instead, it ended up as one of the most bland, hollow movies I've seen in quite sometime. Unless you've never seen a fight movie in your life and want to catch up on the mechanics of how they work, 'Southpaw' will likely underwhelm you to the point of boredom. It just doesn't have any dramatic substance.",3,2,2,27 February 2017
21 Jump Street," A Genre (And Character) That Is Slowly Dying
","There are some parts of '21 Jump Street' that are funny. The trouble is, they are all very predictable and evidence that this genre of film (begun by 'Superbad') may be beginning to die.For a basic plot summary, this film sees two rookie cops given an undercover assignment back in their old high school. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the high school loser now turned cooler, while Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the high-profile jock who now has trouble reclaiming that identity.Like I said, there are a few genuinely funny moments in this movie. Unfortunately, they are very few and far between. This type of comedy has been made so many times that it is almost as if the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away.It doesn't help that Jonah Hill's 'trying to escape adolescence' character might be starting to wear thin after a number of similar flicks. In all fairness, he does provide probably the funniest gags of the film, but it just isn't quite as funny as it used to be.And then, of course, there is Channing Tatum. Women will likely give this film a full star higher rating just by looking at his sculpted physique. Men, on the other hand, will probably be more likely to recognize how wooden he can be at times. He isn't a total loss, but he won't be nominated for any Academy Awards anytime soon.Overall, '21 Jump Street' is the typical crude, profane, & stupid comedy seen a million times since 'Superbad' had such great success. That genre is (or at least should be) on its way out.",3,1,3,9 March 2017
American Hustle," Cinema Fun At Its Finest (But Is It Really Worthy Of All The Awards?)
","Going in to see 'American Hustle', I really had no idea what to expect. To be honest, it didn't look like the type of movie I would usually be interested in, but that dynamite cast mixed with overwhelmingly positive reviews got me in a theater seat. I enjoyed the film and thought it was an exciting mix of cast interactions, period (1970s) references, and some really great music. I just don't understand why it is being nominated for so many prestigious awards.For a basic plot summary, 'American Hustle' tells the story of Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), two individuals who, after a chance meeting, set out on a life of 'hustling' (mainly by charging fees on loans that will never develop). When they are eventually busted by F.B.I. agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), they are given a deal to work together with the government to take down some 'big boys' of crime.The reason this film works so well is because director David O. Russell is such a master of character interactions. He just has that innate ability to pick a perfect cast and then make literally every interaction between them mean something (whether dramatic, comedic, or any other range of emotion). Plus, the 1970s atmosphere is fun to be flung into, complete with vintage clothing, music, and set pieces. There are some negatives to this film, but its main positive is that it has the ability to completely sweep away the viewer and engulf them in every aspect of the movie.The reason I can't give 'American Hustle' five stars or consider it a 'classic' movie? The story is a bit weak. I left the theater (despite being dazzled by the things I described above) thinking 'what was the take-home message of this film?' I felt as if the plot meandered a bit and wasn't as rock solid as perhaps it could/should have been. Maybe this is somewhat of a Russell 'trademark', though, as I gave a similar four-star ranking to last year's 'Silver Linings Playbook' for similar reasons.Thus, my overall verdict for 'American Hustle' was that it was a rip-roaring good time at the theater...but nothing worthy of major awards (perhaps with the exception of Amy Adams, whom I thought gave the best performance of the show). I still think that 'The Fighter' is the best movie directed by Mr. O Russell. Other than that, though, this is a picture that can (and probably should be) watched twice in order to catch all of its complexities.",7,2,6,4 March 2017
10 Things I Hate About You," Is This Maybe The Best Teen Rom-Com Ever?
","(Right off the bat, I'm reviewing this film as a stand-alone movie without any connection to Shakespeare's 'Taming of the Shrew', which supposedly the film is based on. I've never read that particular play, but looking through the plot synopsis it bares only a passing resemblance to this flick...at least in my opinion. As such, I'll be reviewing based solely on the viewing experience.)Though perhaps not my favorite genre of film, I can usually get into a teen romantic comedy/drama as long as it is done right. Despite being pretty much prime age (15) for this one when it first come out (1999), for some reason I had not (until now) seen the whole thing straight through. What I discovered after finally crossing it off my watch list is that '10 Things I Hate About You' is one of the most engaging, witty, emotional, and all-around best teen movies I have ever seen.The plot of the movie can be a bit cumbersome to explain, but here are the basics: Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) is the prettiest, most desired girl in high school. This certainly does not escape the eyes of new kid Cameron (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), who desperately wants to take her out. The problem? Due to a very strict father (Larry Miller), Bianca is not allowed to date until sister Katarina (Julia Stiles) does, and Kat has no interest in high school culture (thus dating) whatsoever. As such, Cameron--with the help of pretty boy Joey (Andrew Keegan)--enlists the help of school bad boy Patrick (Heath Ledger) to woo Kat so he can have a shot at Bianca.'10 Things' has a special energy to it that never wanes from beginning to end. It also expertly combines the stereotypical language/activities one is used to seeing in a teen movie (at least one from the late 90s!) while at the same time turning them on their head (usually via Kat's snarky remarks). Basically, it is the perfect combination of 'fun' and 'deep' (in that special way that only high school can be 'deep').Only helping matters, of course, is the incredible cast. I mean, just look at the above names! At the time most of these actors were relative unknowns, so that fact that most of them are established or legendary in the business today is quite an accomplishment.About the only 'ding' I give this movie is one area where it is a bit transparent: In the early goings, the film expects audiences to believe that: A. Stiles' character could never get a date; & B. Ledger's character is a true 'bad boy'. Neither of these things really work because Stiles is probably the most beautiful woman in the movie and Ledger is too handsome to really pull of 'mysterious'. Fortunately, the film doesn't require a total buy-in on this point (almost as if the filmmakers realized it themselves and didn't hit those characterizations so hard as the film went on), but for a while it is a bit ridiculous.Overall, though, I was incredibly impressed by '10 Things I Hate About You' and actually kind of mad at myself for missing out on its greatness for so long! I have a relatively high 'BS meter' when it comes to movies like this, but '10 Things' captured my interest from the get-go and never saw me wane. Perhaps this sounds a bit clichéd, but what 'The Breakfast Club' is for 80s teens is similar to what '10 Things' accomplishes for the subsequent decade. That isn't a statement I make lightly, either.",9,3,3,9 April 2017
Nightcrawler," Doesn't Pause Enough To Examine The Really Great Material
","On the surface, 'Nightcrawler' is a very well-made film. The production value is high, the visuals are great, acting is solid, and it delves into a number of very relevant themes regarding journalism and TV news. The problem, however, is that director Dan Gilroy doesn't pause nearly enough to examine the really interesting parts of the film. Instead, everything in the movie is kind of viewed in the abstract...with very little (and thus I would argue not nearly enough) context given in order to make it a truly great piece of film-making.For a basic plot summary, 'Nightcrawler' sees Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying desperately to find a job in a rough economy. One night, he stumbles upon a crime scene and meets Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), an independent TV news cameraman who impresses Louis with his ability to 'do the dirty work' and get paid handsomely for it. So, Louis decides to get into the TV journalism business himself, even doing well enough to hire a partner in Rick (Riz Ahmed). Along the way, Louis also develops a relationship (that some might consider inappropriate) with head news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo). Things seem to be going great for Louis and his thriving business...until the night he arrives at a burglary scene before the police, making a number of choices leading him down a shady ethical path that he may or may not recover from.Easily the two most interesting parts of this film are Gyllenhaal's Louis and the movie's examination of the TV news business. Both of those subjects carry very weighty, relevant themes in today's society and are worthy of examination. Unfortunately, both are also just kind of glossed over in favor of 'the spectacle' in this case.Louis is one of the strangest characters I've ever seen on the big screen (done to perfection, as usual, by the underrated Gyllenhaal). On one hand, you can kind of feel sorry for him, as he never seems to catch a break early on. On the other hand, he is such a smarmy individual that he is far from like-able. Usually I like this kind of ambiguity in my film characters, but in this case it comes off more as confusing than interesting. At the end of flick, I didn't feel like I cared any more about Louis than I did, oh, 20 or so minutes in.As for the many themes regarding televised news, I really wish the pace of the film would have allowed even more examination of them. There is a character in the newsroom (played by Kevin Rahm) who always bring up the ethical issues of what is transpiring, but he is quickly pushed aside each and every time. Perhaps that is a statement being made in and of itself, but I still feel like the movie wanted us (as viewers) to take a few too many things at face value. I wanted to see the principals struggle a bit regarding their decisions. There just didn't seem to be any conflict in what was happening.Overall, though, 'Nightcrawler' isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. In my mind, it is the complete and utter personification of a 'three star effort', as it easily did enough to hold my interest, yet didn't do anything more to really make me care in the end. To me, this was very much a 'take it or leave it' experience. Had some closer examination of themes/characters taken place, I think it could have been much, much more interesting.",5,4,6,27 February 2017
Oblivion," Science Fiction In Its Purest Form
","Generally speaking, my favorite films are the ones that are pretty much genre-diverse. Yet, if I do break down into genres, my favorite is science fiction. That is the reason for the five-star ranking of 'Oblivion', as it is simply the purest form of sci-fi put to film.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees the team of Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) monitoring the water-removal from Earth after the planet has been decimated by attack ('we used the nukes', says Jack in an opening montage). On one 'away mission', however, Jack is blind-side by Beech (Morgan Freeman), the leader of a gang of rogues that changes everything that Jack has ever believed in (or thought he believed in).Plot-wise, this is science fiction at its finest. It is part other-worldly, part cautionary tale, part human drama, and all adventure throughout. For those who have watched a lot of sci-fi, all the basic 'landmarks' of such stories are touched upon. It doesn't get old or feel re-hashed, though, as director Joseph Kosinski makes sure to keep the proceedings on track and moving forward.The visuals of 'Oblivion' are also spectacular. You'll feel as if you truly are in the future via the use of interesting, integrated new technologies. This isn't one of those 'all visuals' movies, by no means, but it would be more accurate to say that the visuals perfectly complement the story lines and characters.Overall, sci-fi fans will love 'Oblivion' for its ability to make the mind wonder. It might not be the flick for everyone, but if it looks even at all intriguing to you it's a pretty good bet you'll at least find it somewhat enjoyable (if not much more so).",8,2,2,5 March 2017
Bird Box," As Much About The Characters As The 'Gimmick'
","It would be easy to dismiss Netflix's 'Bird Box' as a 'gimmick' film, capitalizing on the concept set forth by April 2018's 'A Quiet Place'. The major difference between the two films, however, is that 'Bird Box'--much to its credit--focuses more on the characters than the outside factors, making it an overall better, more visceral experience.For a basic plot summary, 'Bird Box' tells the story of Malorie (Sandra Bullock), who is pregnant with her first child and unsure of how to transition into motherhood. Nearly at full term, Malorie's world is turned upside down by a mysterious plague, of sorts, that causes mass violent suicides and seems to be spread simply by sight (looking at a mysterious entity). Flashing back and forth between the present and the future, the film tells the story of how Malorie (and others) must overcome both the physical situation, as well as their own personal demons in order to survive in a world where sight is no longer an option for survival.Much like 'A Quiet Place' (which made sound the culprit), this movie has a great 'hook' (sight is the enemy here) to base the story around. Every great film needs an impetus for the action to revolve around, and 'Bird Box' has that with the inventive concept. Many scenes are legitimately tension-filled and throw many surprises at the audience.What sets 'Bird Box' apart from many of its contemporaries, however, is its ability (and willingness, quite frankly) to really build up the characters (especially Malorie) and have the story suit those needs rather than the other way around. It would have been so easy to just skate by on concept (which, for example, 'A Quiet Place' does despite still being decent in its own right) and only focus on that, but thankfully director Susanne Bier makes it very clear that she knows how to intertwine the relationships/emotions with the intriguing plot. This isn't a movie about an apocalyptic plague/monster, but rather a character study that just happened to be set in much an environment.For a streaming service--Netflix--that is often known for 'quantity over quality' in terms of its original content, 'Bird Box' is a refreshing experience in that it easily could have been released in theaters and likely made back its budget (and probably then some). This is one of the best films I've seen this year (2018) for the way it combines intrigue, suspense, character development, and emotion so seamlessly and entertainingly.",9,3,7,31 December 2018
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Tolkien Would Be Proud
","Adapting a novel for the big screen is never easy, as the printed-word format is often quite expansive and not easily pared down to suit the tastes of moviegoers. Now try the transition with perhaps the most well-known fantasy novel of all-time. That was the task that director Peter Jackson faced while creating 'The Fellowship of the Ring', and not only does he succeed, but he succeeds on perhaps the highest possible level.Most everyone knows the basic story of this film: There is a magic ring that wields an evil power and thus must be destroyed. The ring, which at the beginning of the movie is possessed by Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), is passed down to Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) who begins his trek to destroy it by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom from which it was created. Joining Frodo on this journey are...-Gandalf the Grey Wizard (Ian McKellen) -Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) -Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) -Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) & Bolomir (Sean Bean) -Fellow Hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), & Pippin (Billy Boyd)There is so much I could say about this film specifically, but--simply put--it is perhaps the greatest fantasy novel adaption in the history of cinema. Clearly, J.R.R. Tolkien (original writer of the novel trilogy) crafted an expert story, but Peter Jackson accomplished just as monumental a feat by portraying that story with actions instead of words. There is very little (some might say nothing) lost in the change-over.The main thing that makes this movie work, though, is that it is an 'all-in' effort from the get-go. The production values are higher than potentially any film before or since, and even the details down to costuming, music, location, acting, and special effects really pull the viewer into this epic story. From the opening scene to the final credits, you'll hardly feel like you've been watching a movie. Instead, you will be living it.Thus, 'Fellowship' is an extraordinary film to kick off the LOTR trilogy on the big screen. Taken as a stand-alone novel, I consider 'Fellowship' to be perhaps the greatest of Tolkien's books, and Jackson more than does it justice with this rendering. Though many creepy images/scenes may not appeal to the kiddies or the faint of heart, there are not too many other demographics that I can't recommend this experience to.As the closing credits roll and the promise of further adventures beckons, you are guaranteed to feel two things: an intense desire to move on to 'The Two Towers', and a satisfied feeling knowing that an incredible book has been transformed into a never-to-be-outdone film.",10,1,1,10 March 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," A Better Ending After A Muddled Middle
","After being so disappointed/confused with 'The Matrix Reloaded' after seeing it in the theater in 2003, I didn't even see this film on the big screen when it came out, instead renting it once it came out on home video. After viewing, I realized that I missed the wrong Matrix film to skip for a long period of time.Whereas 'Revolutions' does not come close to the first film in duplicating the originality of the idea, it superbly triumphs the sub-par second film by eliminating much of the philosophical mumbo-jumbo and instead focus on a plot that the average viewer has a chance to understand.Essentially, two things happen during the course of this film (I liken it to the Lord of the Rings series, where Frodo/Sam do their thing while the rest of Middle Earth fights Sauron): First, the city of Zion braces for (and eventually does engage) the approach machine army. The special effects in the war scenes are pretty incredible...not anything we haven't seen before, but not even as close to as faky as those in 'Reloaded'. The other plot line sees Neo and Trinity traveling deep into the heart of Machine City, where Neo ultimately has his final confrontation with the seemingly unstoppable Agent Smith. That final showdown is so intense (and so awaited) that it will raise the hairs on the back of your neck!Overall, then, this film falls somewhere in between the originality of the first installment of the trilogy and the over-the-top sequel. Upon the conclusion of 'Revolutions', I (and I consider myself to be an above-average viewer of science fiction) was still a bit confused as to what had exactly transpired, but not the utter sense of confusion I felt after viewing 'Reloaded'. Instead, 'Revolutions' prompted me to check out what people were saying on the Internet, and eventually I did grasp the fundamental concept of what had happened.So, if you were extremely disappointed by 'Reloaded' and vowed to never view another Matrix film ever again, I strongly suggest that you give this one a try, as it completes the story of Neo in way that you can understand (even if it MAY take a little extra help from Internet scribes!).",7,1,1,11 March 2017
Man of Steel," Hardly Improves Upon Anything
","Though few and far between, there are movies (or movie franchises) that absolutely repel the notion of being re-made or re-imagined. For instance, it would be asinine to remake Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy (e.g. they are now the definitive version that will stand the test of time). Or, imagine the heresy in trying to recreate the 'Back To The Future' series. Those same problems are part of the reason why 'Man of Steel' will not fully take flight. It just so happens that the 1970s Christopher Reeve version of the character might never be improved upon. It is just tough for movie-goers to believe this notion regarding a movie made in the 70s.For a basic plot summary, 'Man of Steel' basically uses the familiar story (from 'Superman II') of Superman's (Henry Cavill) battle with General Zod (Michael Shannon) of Krypton. The film serves as yet another origin story (though this time with many key differences from traditional canon) with Clark Kent interacting with human father Jonathan (Kevin Costner), human mother Martha (Diane Lane), Lois Lane (Amy Adams), and Kryptonian father Jor-El (Russell Crowe).In analyzing why this movie will be viewed as somewhat of a failure (despite not being all that terrible standing on its own) I will now have to use some spoilers. You have been warned.The trouble with 'Man of Steel' is primarily two-fold:First, this is not as 'deep' of a movie as what was expected (or what we were lead to believe in the trailer). Despite my sincere hope that Christopher Nolan could pull off a 'dark, gritty Superman' character like he did with his 'Batman' trilogy, it just doesn't work. One can easily liken this film to 'Batman Begins', except whereas 'Begins' felt so natural to the Batman character, 'Man of Steel' feels forced.Secondly, most of the changes made to the Superman canon of previous material are changes for the worse. For example (here come some spoilers...)-Clark letting father Jonathan die in a Kansas twister so as not to reveal his powers -Lois meeting Clark very early on in the narrative and discovering his true identity -The look and feel of Krypton (dark and gloomy) -Transformers-esque fight scenes that stimulate all senses but the mind/emotions.Now, granted, this film did enough things right to be decent. The character of Zod is given (in true Nolan 'develop the villain as much as the hero fashion') a much better backstory in this installment than any previous. It is fascinating to contemplate the notion of why exactly he is so ruthless and bent on restoring Krypton. Also, the acting is pretty solid as well. Even lacking great script material to work with, all the principles perform solidly.When it comes right down to it, though, 'Man of Steel' might be the 'proof in the pudding' that Superman's definitive version was created by Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve in the 1970s. In 'Superman Returns', Bryan Singer had a great kernel of an ideal ('Superman returns to a world in need of him') but couldn't correctly navigate the logistics to pull of even a decent film. In 'Man of Steel', Nolan gets the procedural stuff right but completely loses the heart of the story in the process.",4,1,2,6 March 2017
Cast Away," Utilizes Multiple Genres And Nails Them All
","In 1985, director Rob Zemeckis created perhaps the most genre-diverse film of all-time with Back To The Future. Fifteen years later, he came close to duplicating that extraordinary feat with Cast Away, an incredibly diverse movie in its own right.For a basic plot summary, Cast Away tells the story of Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx worker who goes down over the Pacific in an airplane, washes ashore a deserted island, and must fend for himself in the harsh terrain and conditions.The key to this film is its ability to combine such genres as action, adventure, disaster, comedy, and drama and, most importantly, make them all mesh together and work on the big screen. All the pieces come together nicely to form a moving, exciting, always-moving (I never quite understand why some people consider it 'slow) plot & character development.What really makes this movie a classic, however, is that it is a human interest flick at heart. The mental & physical struggle of Chuck is at center stage here, and the acting from Hanks is impeccable as usual (he can play anything!). It speaks volumes that, within 90 minutes, you may be expressing emotion towards a man's relationship with a volleyball.Overall, I wish more movies would be produced like Cast Away. It has a little something for everyone. Though many film fans consider Forrest Gump to be Hanks' crowning achievement, I personally enjoy this effort tenfold, as here the multiple themes actually converge to form a coherent, dramatic narrative in the end. All in all, a great film that can be watched multiple times to catch the subtle nuances and character growth.",10,3,4,11 March 2017
The Village," M. Night's Final Trickery
","The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs are three terrific suspense/mystery flicks from director M. Night Shyamalan. Lady In The Water and The Happening are two of the worst. The Village falls right in the middle; the final time that M. Night truly entranced us at the theater.I wish I could give you a little plot summary, but this is the type of film where the less known about it the better. I will say this: Whereas today's 'wonderboy' director JJ Abrams is all about time travel and relative physics concepts, M. Night's trademark was misdirection. You think this movie is about one thing, but in the end it is 180-degrees of surprise.Overall, this is a suspenseful, mysterious film that will have you on the edge of your seat. Enjoy the 104 minutes while you can, though, as after this effort M. Night was never quite the same.",7,2,3,8 March 2017
The Revenant," Not Terrible, But Potentially Very Overrated Depending On Taste
","When I first saw the promotional materials for 'The Revenant', I wasn't all that excited. Wilderness/survival films aren't usually my cup of tea, and while I can appreciate the acting of Leonardo DiCaprio, his presence in a film doesn't usually vault it to the top of my 'must-see' lists. But then, slowly but surely, 'Revenant' became the film that any self-respecting film fan 'must see' in order to accurately judge this cycle's Academy Awards. It even strongly positioned DiCaprio to win his first Oscar. So, I climbed aboard the hype train and finally went to see it. While it isn't a bad movie by any means, I left the theater thinking it has the potential to be very disappointing to people who don't really know what it is about or what it tries to accomplish.For a basic plot summary, 'The Revenant' is the story of Hugh Glass (DiCaprio), a fur trader in 1820s America. The basics of his character are that he's a bit of an outcast, having married an Indian woman (now dead) and having a son with her. He also happens to be the best scout of his trading group, so he's still accepted by Captain Andrew Henry (Domhnall Gleeson). However, when Glass sustains horrific injuries after being mauled by a bear, he is left behind with fellow trader John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy). Fitzgerald isn't nearly as sympathetic to Glass as the others, however, and basically leaves him for dead. But not so fast...as Glass proves again and again his determination to survive even in the face of insurmountable odds.I think the major misconception I had about this movie was that it would be a dramatic epic...but it isn't. It looks like an epic and has been touted as an epic, but at its core that isn't what 'The Revenant' is all about. It's actually more of an artistic picture, filled with long, lingering, and beautiful cinematography, some strange/bizarre dream sequences, and just that overall sense that the 'look' of the film itself was more important than the story/characters.Now, don't get me wrong...the cinematography in 'Revenant' is some of the best I've ever seen on the big screen. That's why I can still give the move a three-star rating, as it is a visual treat in the way it portrays its wilderness setting. Seemingly around every corner is a new adventure or obstacle that must be faced, and all of those scenarios are filmed in a unique, rollicking style.However, I was just expecting a bit more of a fleshed-out story and maybe some better- developed characters (this seems to start off as a character study of Glass but then morphs into a simple revenge tale). In terms of acting, I also don't quite understand why this is 'the movie' to (maybe) finally get DiCaprio his little gold statue. His performance is good, but I didn't find anything spectacular about it. Personally, I thought the best character/acting of the whole piece was Tom Hardy's brooding, violent Fitzgerald, as I felt that he was creating emotional drama instead of just reacting to the next obstacle along the way (my evaluation of Leo's performance).So, overall, 'The Revenant' didn't live up to it's hype for me. I was decently entertained, but that was about it. Now, someone who has a keener eye/appreciation for pure cinematography than I might find it utterly riveting, but that just wasn't to be for me. I'm all about characters and story, and in those areas I didn't see any area in which 'The Revenant' stood out against even average movies, much less those being heavily promoted as Oscar favorites.",5,1,1,26 February 2017
Trouble with the Curve," Eastwood's Well-Rounded Return To Acting
","After starring in the remarkable 'Million Dollar Baby' in 2004, then following it up with the gritty 'Gran Torino' in 2008, Clint Eastwood announced his 'retirement' from acting, instead focusing on on directing/producing films. When the script for 'Trouble with the Curve' came along, though, Mr. Eastwood decided that it was too good of a vehicle to pass up. Thus, in his return to leading-man status, the 82-year old thespian proves that his filmmaking (or film-choosing) instincts are as solid as ever.For a basic plot summary, 'Trouble with the Curve' focuses on Gus (Eastwood), an aged baseball scout who relies on his eyes, senses, and gut feelings to scout the top prospects. The trouble is, his eyes are failing and his job is on the line. As such, Gus's friend Pete (John Goodman) is concerned about him and gives a call to Mickey (Amy Adams), Gus's daughter. Predictably, the father-daughter duo do not share a strong relationship with each, and that is tested on a road trip together to scout the newest 'can't miss' prospect. Along the way, rival scout Johnny (Justin Timberlake) teaches both parts of the duo a little something about each other and their lives.When evaluating 'Trouble with the Curve', there is one thing that you must do: Absolutely DO NOT try to compare it to 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Gran Torino'. It's not even so much that it doesn't measure up to those movies (although it doesn't), but rather that it takes a bit of a different tone. It is a bit more light-hearted and not nearly as 'life-or-death serious' as those other flicks.When looked at under its own merits, then, 'Curve' is an excellent film that does everything it sets out to do. The plot is interesting enough to keep you invested, the emotion runs high throughout, and the acting is superb. Eastwood is his typical self, while Adams and Timberlake provide the much-needed camaraderie that a movie like this needs from time to time. The characters aren't quite as fleshed-out as a normal Eastwood movie (in this case, there is more 'telling' of emotions than 'showing', generally speaking), but they are still engaging.Basically, 'Trouble with the Curve' is a conglomeration of a number of different themes (aging, fatherhood, baseball scouting, etc.) that work not in isolation but blended together. All those themes have been done better in other movies, but having them all play off each other still manages to produce a cinematic treat. I hope Eastwood still continues to shine ON the camera as well as BEHIND it, but if this does turn out to be his final acting role, there is no reason to look back with any regret.",8,2,2,5 March 2017
Bridge of Spies," Explaining The Cold War Era
","The combination of director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks is almost certain to produce a quality product at the cinema. That's exactly what happens (again) with 'Bridge of Spies'. It probably won't be your favorite effort from either of those two film luminaries, but it is instead a quite, brooding tale about life and espionage during the Cold War.For a basic plot summary, 'Bridge of Spies' tells the adapted-from-true-events story of James B. Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer tapped to defend one of the most hated men in America, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who is convicted of spying in our homeland for the Soviet Union. Donovan first fights for Abel's rights (when no one else will seem to, even in full breach of the law), then is sent to Russia in order to facilitate an espionage-laden exchange mission.The area in which 'Bridge of Spies' works best is when it can relate the themes of the Cold War to everyday life, showing that the events around the world may change over time, but people's reactions to them are usually more predictable. The overwhelmingly negative and hateful response to Abel's more presence in the country is startlingly familiar to the country's response to people of Islamic faith after 9/11. Seemingly all rule of law (and even some of decency) was thrown out the window in favor of 'patriotic justice'. Early in the film, there is also a poignant angle dealing with how children are reacting to Cold War tensions. At school, they are taught to 'duck and cover' in case of an Atomic explosion (right after reciting the pledge of allegiance, of course), and at home Donovan's children are all very conflicted about how he could possibly defend the 'Commie traitor'.Bolstering those themes is the expected brilliance from Hanks in the leading role. Here, he is very much akin to, say, Atticus Finch in 'To Kill A Mockingbird', or the typical Jimmy Stewart 'defend peace and law at all costs' type role. In a world turned upside-down with misinformation about the Communists and hatred about something that isn't probably understood, Hanks's Donovan is able to keep a level head and pursue the tasks that really seem to make a difference, such as diplomacy and preserving the rule of law.The only reason 'Bridge of Spies' probably isn't even better is that the 'espionage stuff' over in Russia, while still rather entertaining in general, isn't the highlight of this film. The themes in the first half or so of the movie, feating Donovan's interactions with his family and the Abel case, just work on a deeper level. It still turns out to be a pretty emotional and satisfying ending, but the time spent in Russia is where things tend to get a little formulaic or draggy. Again, nothing terrible, but enough for me to drop this to four stars instead of an all-out five.Overall, I enjoyed the deep themes and powerful messages of 'Bridge of Spies', as well as the notable acting performances given. It is a movie that can really be enjoyed by anyone teenaged years and up, as it touches on so many distinct avenues to get its message across. That Cold War era is one that often doesn't get its 'fair shake' in history books or curriculums, so it is nice to see Spielberg bring it to the masses.",8,1,2,27 February 2017
Split," Doesn't Always Make Sense, But So Much Fun You May Not Care
","The resume of filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan reads like a roller coaster: Peak (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), Decline (Village, Lady In The Water), complete bottoming out (Happening, Devil, Last Airbender, After Earth), and recent resurgence (Visit). 'Split' fits right in with that narrative, as it turns out to be Shyamalan's best movie this decade.For a basic plot summary, 'Split' sees three teenagers Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), Marcia (Jessica Sula), and Claire (Haley Lu Richardson) abducted by a mysterious man (James McAvoy) who seems to be harboring multiple personalities. As the girls struggle to find a way to stay alive and escape, the man's therapist (Betty Buckley) starts smelling something fishy, while flashbacks show that Casey may have some similar demons in common with this mystery kidnapper.'Split' is more of a psychological thriller than, say, 'The Visit', and I think that really suits Shyamalan's filmmaking style. He's great at creating an atmosphere of tension and setting up some really creepy scenarios. There is even a sliver of 'real science' permeating the film that at least tries to ground it in reality a bit. What it all adds up to is a film that is equal parts creepy and fun.That being said, 'Split' doesn't always make sense or amount to the scale it seems to be built upon. In other words, the setup is significantly better than the climax. Even the traditional 'twist ending' from Shyamalan, though present here, is of a completely different variety than his usual shenanigans (probably a good thing, though, in all honestly). Like I said, though, 'Split' is just so much fun to watch as it's rolling along that its shortcomings are usually overshadowed.The acting in 'Split' also goes into the 'plus' column. McAvoy is truly a treat (a performance worthy of anything that will be featured at the Oscars), while Taylor-Joy continues to establish herself (after 'The Witch') as an up-and-coming star.Overall, 'Split' is the kind of film that epitomizes what Shyamalan is all about. It isn't his peak, but it does showcase his taut, spooky, madcap style of movie-making. It may not hold up to intense scrutiny, but it was one of the most enjoyable, exciting film experiences I've had of late.",7,4,12,24 February 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Maybe They Should Have Done All The Later Movies Like This
","After about 'Prisoner Of Azkaban' (movie #3), I felt that the movies based on books 4-6 really just didn't do the novels their true justice (especially the 'Order of the Phoenix' and 'Half-Blood Prince' films). By that point, the books were long past the simpler tales of 'Sorcerer's Stone' and 'Chamber of Secrets', and as a result they inevitably glossed over so many key parts of the series. Fortunately, the movie producers realized that such an approach just would not work for the magnitude of the final Potter installment, and thus the project was split in half. The best choice that could have possibly been made, IMHO.For a basic plot summary, 'Deathly Hallows 1' sees Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) searching for Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) remaining Horcruxes. While the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts fall pretty much completely under Death Eater control, the trio learn about the Deathly Hallows and the endgame for Voldemort's master plan begins to take shape.There is no lag in this film whatsoever. It starts off with a bang and never looks back (just like the book). Yet, it is not just an 'action extravaganza' like I perceived 'Order of the Phoenix' to be. It is also filled with nuanced character performances, humor, and a sense of gravitas (provided by director David Yates) that makes the whole experience very well-rounded.Until recently, I really wasn't a fan of the 'part one', 'part two' concept of filmmaking. However, after seeing the success of this film (and the more recent 'Hobbit' trilogy), I now am wondering if perhaps this is the way that books should be parlayed into movies all the time. A film like this allows for many more of J.K. Rowling's little nuances to show up instead of things feeling rushed and glossing over a good many plot points. Had, for example, 'Order of the Phoenix' been done this way, I think I would have liked it a great deal more.",9,1,3,6 March 2017
North by Northwest," A Well-Constructed Spy Romp
","When it comes to Alfred Hitchcock pictures, his 'MacGuffin' plot style is quite a bit overused (especially by today's standards). 'North By Northwest' contains that same style of film-making. However, this film is so well-constructed otherwise that it still holds up well over time.For a basic plot summary, 'North by Northwest' follows the exploits of one Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), who is mistaken for another man and happens to fall into a Cold War spy ring led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason). Along the way, Thornhill is romanced (and does a fair share of the romancing) by Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose character may not be exactly who she seems.In terms of plot, this is one of Hitchcock's best...if only for the first half of the film when the mystery of 'Thornhill/Kaplan' is still brewing. Once the truth is disclosed, however, the MacGuffin quickly becomes apparent and kind of turns the movie into a simply spy tale (and thus it loses a little luster).The acting is terrific, as Hitch makes the 'bad guys' genuinely creepy (I mean, Martin Landau's face alone is enough to do that!) and showcases Grant & Saint throughout.Bernard Hermann's soundtrack also deserves a good chunk of the credit for keeping the latter portions of this movie interesting, as those famous Hermann strings refuse to let viewers relax even for a moment during the climactic moments.Overall, 'North by Northwest' is a very good Hitchcock effort that deserves watching by any fan of the director or just cinema buffs in general. A 3.5 ranking would be my exact choice, but because of it being so well-made, I bump it up to four stars.",7,1,3,7 March 2017
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Lacks The Gravitas Of The Previous Films
","There are many problems with 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'. Despite those problems, however, it manages to remain an okay flick. It's just disappointing, considering it could have been oh so much more.For a basic plot summary, 'T3' sees a future in which Judgment Day has not yet happened because of the successful events of T2. John Connor (Nick Stahl) is a vagrant, moving from place to place in search of relief for his nightmares about a potential apocalypse. In 2004, a female Terminator (Kristanna Loken) comes hunting for John and a number of people who become his future associates. So does Judgment Day still happen? That will be up to John, Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), and the classic Terminator model (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to figure out.The good thing I have to say about this film is that it uses the Skynet plot line that probably should have been used in T2 (I never liked the Cyberdyne angle of that film). For the first time in this series, viewers get to see what Skynet would have been like in its initial stages, and that was pretty cool.The big and obviously problem, however, is that 'T3' lacks the gravitas that the other films before it so easily possessed. This was probably due to James Cameron removing himself from the director's chair. This feels too much like a 'tacked on' film that was kind of making things up as it went along. They stumbled upon an interesting Skynet plot, but other than that it is kind of a mess. Too many explosions and gun battles, as that isn't what this series is really about.Truth be told, I can only give this movie three stars because I like the sci-fi and time-travel aspects of the franchise. Basically, I want it to be better than it really is. It is more of a 2.5 or maybe even 2-star effort. Sad, as such a better story could have been told.",4,3,7,3 March 2017
The Shining," Appreciate Nicholson, But Don't Try To Dissect
","In terms of classic horror films, this one is a must-watch for its imagery and quality acting. However, don't expect to be satisfied with the plot no matter how many times you watch it.For a basic plot summary, 'The Shining' tells the story of the Torrence family, who are assigned to 'house-sit' a large hotel for the winter. Jack Torrence (Jack Nicholson) begins to behave strangely, while his 'special' son Danny (Danny Lloyd) and wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) must reap the consequences of that trip down insanity road for their father/husband.Easily the high point of this film is Nicholson's portrayal of a man slowly being driven completely insane. With the facial expressions and extreme physical moods/movements that Nicholson brings to every role, he provides the most chilling scenes of the entire experience.The problem, however, is in trying to decipher the overall plot of the movie. Director Stanley Kubrick basically just bombards viewers with all kinds of different themes, but then steps back in the end to let those viewers draw their own conclusions as to what is really going on. Unfortunately, many of Kubrick's themes blatantly contradict each other, making it impossible to ever truly 'figure it out'. Some elements are borrowed from the Stephen King novel of the same name, while others are original to the Kubrick adaptation. The mix of the two is not conducive to an understandable plot.Overall, I have now viewed this movie three times, and enjoyed it a little less each time. I always enjoy Nicholson's screen time, but just get too frustrated trying to piece the plot together. In fact, a 3.5-star rating would more accurately portray my feelings towards the film. In all honesty, I enjoyed the King novel more, and would recommend it (if not for the brilliant Nicholson) over this Kubrick version.",4,1,4,11 March 2017
American Beauty," Great Themes, But A Bit Esoteric In Overall Point
","'American Beauty' is hailed as one of the premiere films of all-time for its ability to peel back the fake atmosphere of the American Suburb and look at things for how they really are. While the film definitely makes the viewer think about those themes, it also fails to make a real point about what it is trying to say.For a basic plot summary, 'American Beauty' centers on a family living the 'typical suburban life' in America. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a middle-aged man with a decent-paying job providing for his family. He is also absolutely miserable in his existence. Wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) is an un-loving, career driven women who is just trying to 'hold things together' in both her life and her family's. Daughter Jane (Thora Birch) is your typical awkward teenage girl...not knowing where she fits in either at home or at school. One day, the introduction of Jane's new beautiful, seductive friend Angela (Mena Suvari) to father Lester sparks in him some life that he long thought was lost. As Lester beings to throw caution to the wind and basically do what he wants, it sets in motion a chain of events that ripple throughout the entire community. Quirky neighbor boy Ricky Fits (Wes Bentley) capturing all the action on his hand-held camera provides a definitive record for the changes in suburbia.Clearly, 'American Beauty' is a very deep (theme-wise) type of film. It is meant to crash through preconceptions, break down boundaries, and getting people thinking about their lives. In this, the film pretty much succeeds. If you are a human being and breathing, you can probably find at least something to relate to in one (or more) of the characters in the film. Director Sam Mendes does a great job of peeling back the 'curtain of normality' that many families live under, showing instead the seedier side of what is really going on. Many of these themes (middle-aged man's infatuation with a teen tart, homosexuality, promiscuity, etc.) will be quite uncomfortable to some viewers, but that is really the whole point. It is kind of meant to shock people in order to get them thinking.The great acting of the movie also deserves special praise. This is pretty much the role that Spacey seems born to play (a little creepy, a little human), and at times he truly does steal the show. All the auxiliary cast around him, however, turn in great roles. Great character actor Chris Cooper even turns in a complex performance as 'Colonel Fits'. Without these very real character performances, 'American Beauty' would have lost much of its gusto.All of that being said, I can't quite put 'American Beauty' into the upper echelon of my favorite films because it seems to be lacking a 'point' to the whole exercise. If the goal of the entire project had been to get people thinking about life in suburbia (and only that), I think it would have appealed to me a bit more. As it is, however, it seems like the movie wanted to make a deeper point...a point that suburbia is not only 'fake', but also 'harmful' to individual psyches. I could write pages and pages here about these types of themes, but this isn't the forum for that (and it would include a ton of spoilers). Suffice it to say, though, that the film's narrative failed me a little bit in the end in that all the characters seem just as miserable having opened themselves up to their true purposes/desires as when they were repressed. As the final credits rolled, I found myself thinking over and over 'so...what exactly was the point of that?'.So, I think that 'American Beauty' is a solid film that will get any of its viewers thinking about issues relating to job/life stagnation and 'putting on a front' for unhappiness that just masks the problem instead of dealing with it. An entire lifetime can be thrown away in this pattern. Beyond that, the film tries to be a bit more than that and, on those grounds, failed a bit (at least with me). Any fans of 'thinking cinema' should at least give it a watch, as it is one of those movies that is tough to truly convey with words. It really must be seen and experienced in order to be 'understood'.",7,1,4,2 March 2017
Warrior," The Next Great Fight Movie For The New Fight Generation
","Over the years, the sport of boxing has provided film-goers with undeniably great films like 'Rocky', 'The Champ', 'Million Dollar Baby', and 'The Fighter'. In today's culture, though, boxing has been replaced by mixed martial arts as the fight game of choice. This is a movie that speaks to that culture.For a basic plot summary, 'Warrior' tells the story of two brothers. Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton) is a high school physics teacher moonlight as a UFC fighter in parking lots at night for the money. Tommy Conlon (Tom Hardy) is a former Marine and former high school wrestling champion. Their only two common interests? Hatred of their father Paddy (Nick Nolte), and the opportunity to win the biggest even in their sport of choice.Simply put, 'Warrior' is ever bit as good as 'The Fighter' (in fact, both films share many of the same superb characteristics). This movie is a human drama first, with MMA fighting being the backdrop for the dramatic material. It is a visceral story that is not simple in any sense of the word. It is very dramatic, to be sure, yet it still maintains a very healthy grip on character relationships and thus stays as true to reality as possible. There are shades of grey in everything, with nothing being cut-and-dry.For hardcore MMA fans, 'Warrior' also offers some great fight scenes and action. When you are watching the fights, it seems as if you are truly watching a live UFC event.Thus, 'Warrior' is a top-notch drama that compares very favorably to the best fight films ever produced. It will truly make you care about the characters and be rooting for them (or even against them) in a variety of complex ways. It's 'The Fighter'...only with triangle chokes and arm- bars.",10,7,11,4 March 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The 'Empire Strikes Back' Of The Terminator Franchise
","After the original 'Terminator' film that was so ahead of its time that the special effects couldn't keep up with James Cameron's vision, 'T2: Judgment Day' is an action-packed, adventure-filled extravaganza. It basically does everything Cameron wanted to do in the first one...and then some. The only problem? It skimps on the time-travel storyline in favor of the romping action.For a basic plot summary, T2 tells the story of a young John Connor (Edward Furlong), a boy who is vital to the future of human civilization once the machines take over in 1997. With mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) in a mental institution for her wild (yet accurate) claims of the future, John has turned into a rebellious youngster. When a new kind of cybernetic (Robert Patrick) comes from the future to hunt him down, this time John is protected by the Model 101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that tried to kill his mother. The goal this time? Trying to prevent Skynet from ever being created.T2 is an entertaining experience that never gets boring. The special effects are explosive, the pace is always moving forward, and the franchise certainly sheds its '80s movie' clichéd reputation with a slick, edgy new look. Patrick nearly steals the show as the advanced, liquid metal Terminator, one of the great on-screen villains of all-time. Simply put, there is simply a lot to like about the film that most people consider to be the best in the franchise.For me, however, T2 comes in a notch below the original. Why? When I watch this franchise, I primarily watch it for the intriguing past/future time-travel storyline. That kind of gets lost in this one, what with all the stunts and visual effects. Even the plot arc involving Cyberdyne kind of gets short shrift. Personally, I liked the gritty, darker tone of the first film better. More focus on story/characters than on effects, humor, and action.The best analogy I can make is that T2 reminds me of 'Empire Strikes Back' of the original Star Wars trilogy. That film also forgoes plot a bit in favor of rollicking adventure. Many people (just like T2) think that is the best installment of that series, but I liked its predecessor a bit better (just like in this case too). I can appreciate 'Judgment Day' for what it is, but I can't say its my favorite.Overall, though, T2 is a fun movie that I can still enjoy. It adds some elements to the franchise that I like (primarily Patrick's character). I just wanted a bit more story.",6,3,5,3 March 2017
Heartbreak Ridge," Could Easily Be A Prequel To 'Gran Torino'
","Last year, Clint Eastwood wowed moviegoers with his gritty, realistic performance as Walt 'Get Off My Lawn!' Kowalski in the film 'Gran Torino'. In 'Heartbreak Ridge', the U.S. Marines are the 'lawn' and Eastwood (once again) isn't taking any prisoners.Basically, the film centers on a Marines Recon unit of the 1980s that, in all aspects, has 'gone soft' in a time of peace. Gone is the strict military discipline of the 1940s-1960s, and in its place is a disrespectful, laissez-faire attitude towards fighting for our freedoms. That all changes, of course, when Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood) is brought in to lead the unit. Though Highway is only given the assignment as a disciplinary measure, it quickly becomes clear to him how far the Marines have fallen. No angel himself (Highway is shown instigating a prison riot at the beginning of the film), Highway goes about instilling into a rag-tag bunch of young men the kind of military values that he holds near and dear.Much like 'Gran Torino', then, the most entertaining portion of this film is watching Eastwood embody that kind of old-world toughness that is on its way out (for better or worse) as the World War II and Korea veterans begin to pass away. Both Highway and Kowalski are the type of men who will have your back to the end if you respect them and do right by them, but the only way they know how to show it is through harsh profanity, crude jokes, and a crotchety demeanor that belies their true emotions. Whereas Walt bonds with a young boy who shows potential but just needs some strong leadership in his life, Thomas Highway runs the same emotional gamut with his Marines Unit.There are only a few things that keep this movie from 'instant classic' status, those being Highway's rather un-interesting love life on the military base, as well as an ending that just seemed to fall a bit flat considering the entertainment that preceded it. 'Torino' was a bit more adept (and thus more deserving of a five-star rating) at handling the emotional drama of Eastwood's character, as well as providing a better send-off.Thus, whether you want to look at 'Heartbreak Ridge' as a prequel to 'Gran Torino', or 'Torino' as a sequel to 'Ridge', the similarities between both films are readily apparent. If you loved watching Eastwood's gruff, tough Walt Kowalski portrayal, you will love this film as well. If you were offended by the type of prejudices that Walt held, steer a wide berth around this movie.",7,1,2,12 March 2017
Disturbia," When Shia LaBeouf Ruled The Teenage World
","When evaluated as the thriller it is advertised to be, 'Disturbia' is slightly above average, providing just enough drama/suspense to keep viewers interested. However, add in the incredible acting of Shia LaBeouf, and the film easily jumps up into the 'very solid' category.For a basic plot summary, 'Disturbia' very loosely follows the premise of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window'. In this case, young Kale (LaBeouf) is confined to house arrest after slugging a teacher. While homebound, Kale enlists the help of friend Ronnie (Aaron Yoo) and new-to-town girlfriend Ashley (Sarah Roemer) to spy on the next-door-neighbor Mr. Turner (David Morse), who they believe to be a serial killer.As I mentioned in the opener, as a 'thriller' alone this movie is passable. If you are a veteran of the genre you'll likely know what is coming a mile away, but it's watchable. Some may deride the effort as a 'Hitchcock rip-off', but it should instead be viewed as a 'Hitchcock re-interpretation' for the younger generation (the ones who have no interest in watching Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly).The hallmark of the experience, though, is easily the acting of LaBeouf, who (as he so often did during that time period) represents the typical American teenage boy. He struggles with the utter boredom of house arrest, spies on the bikini-clad teenage girl across the yard (and then befriends her in his awkward way), and lets himself get completely swept up in a fantastical plot involving Mr. Turner. These are all things that teenagers can relate to (or even older folks can remember relating to!) and make the movie much more personal to the viewer.To me, 'Disturbia' will always represent the peak of LaBeouf's teen flicks (right along with 'Holes' & 'Transformers'). Every time I watch this movie, I actually find myself enjoying the setup (first 2/3) more than the resolution (1/3), and his interactions with all the characters is the primary reason for that. I can't say it's an all-time classic, but it represents a certain time of life for me that has become cemented by the sands of time. That's why I can always still enjoy this one.",8,2,4,8 March 2017
Edward Scissorhands," Strange...But With Heart
","The best thing that 'Edward Scissorhands' has going for it is that it was directed by Tim Burton, perhaps the only man who could make this story move us. Unfortunately, Burton is also this film's biggest downfall by intermixing his cinematic and stereotype gobbledegook into the overall plot.For a basic plot summary, this film sees a boy named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors instead of normal hands, brought down from his lonely, deserted castle to live in suburbia. After all the appropriate hijinks such a situation perpetuates, Edward falls in love with his new family's daughter Kim (played by Winona Ryder), which only further complicates matters.The reason this isn't an 'instant classic' despite the never-before-seen concept and compelling visuals? For almost three quarters of the movie, director Burton (as is his style) mishmashes all sorts of stereotypical human themes and doesn't make sense of any of them. It is all just a jumble & mess. It's kind of like 'Being John Malkovich', in a sense, where the concepts and visuals are the movie, not the actual plot itself.How can I enjoy this movie, then? Because, in the end, it truly is about love and having a big heart. For me, when everything else falls aside and the focus is squarely on Edward & Kim is where this film will move you. Ryder is able to perfectly capture the essence of youthful beauty, while Edward is a character for whom sympathy is a must. Their moments on screen together (combined with a wonderful score from Danny Elfman) are spectacular and worth the viewing time alone.Overall, this is a decent film that will always be remember for its unique concept and title character. Don't try to understand all its message, but instead focus on the human elements: love, family, & hope. If you can do that, you will care about what happens in the end.",6,1,3,11 March 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," The Comedy Shines First and Foremost
","If, while watching 'Silver Linings Playbook', you have previous experience with bipolar disease, then the film will likely speak to your heart. If, however, you are like me and really don't know anything about bipolar-ism, the humor in the movie will still keep you enjoying it throughout.For a basic plot summary, 'Silver Linings Playbook' sees Pat (Bradley Cooper), a diagnosed bi- polar sufferer, being released from a mental institution and trying to fit back into his family and society at large. This includes a father (Robert De Niro) who is a die-hard Eagles fan and is as superstitious as they come, a friend (John Ortiz) completely treading water in his marriage, and a mother (Jacki Weaver) who is always caught in the middle. It is only after Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow battling multiple personal demons of her own, that he realizes the lengths he must go to in order to succeed in battling his illness.At heart, this is a film about mental illness and its effects on everyday life. If you have experienced similar situations, the storyline will likely touch you on a very deep level. Yet, just the humor of some of the situations this crazy family puts itself in will easily be enough to keep your interest level high. The moral of the story is that we are all a little 'screwed up' on some level, but we just need to find that 'silver lining' to get through life. Whether those themes touch you a little bit or a lot, there is enough comedy to keep things from really bogging down.Plus, even if all else fails for you in the viewing process, there is the appeal of watching the two beautiful leads. Lawrence is showcased in enough workout outfits and dance costumes to perk up males in the audience, while I hear the ladies like Mr. Cooper just a tad as well.Overall, 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a solid movie, though not really an all-time classic. It does enough things right--like make you laugh a little, think a little, feel a little--to be solid and not boring in any way.",7,1,2,7 March 2017
Divergent," Doesn't Rise Above Contemporaries (From An Adult Perspective)
","Whenever most books or films are made for the young adult audience, there are certain 'benchmarks' that need to be hit in order to appeal to the target audience (e.g. attractive actors, romance, angst, simple concepts). While those benchmarks make those works extraordinarily popular for that target audience, they also limit the book or film's appeal to a broader population. That is why, at least for me (28-year old male), 'Divergent' was just an 'okay' movie.For a basic plot summary, 'Divergent' tells the story of Tris (Shailene Woodley), a teenage girl living in a future society where each person must choose from a prescribed list of professions upon a certain date. There is an aptitude test that helps determine which profession one should tend towards. The trouble with Tris, however, is that her test comes up 'divergent', meaning that her brain doesn't focus on just one of the areas. This is something that must be hidden, as it is looked down upon and may make her a danger to government officials like Jeanine (Kate Winslet). Choosing a profession that is somewhat surprising, Tris makes the transition to a soldier-type life, where she meets Four (Theo James), a superior who is tough on her but also shows an interest in her well-being.I liked the framework upon which the plot of this movie is built (I've never read the book, so I really can't make comparisons). Every high school student has taken a 'which career should I choose?' test, so the concept is very relate-able. The whole 'what to do next in life' is something we can all relate to, young adults probably more than anyone.The problem, though, is that 'Divergent' tries to cram a lot of things into a relatively small (2 hours, 15 minutes) package. There's drama, action, romance, political intrigue, big ideas...a little too much to focus on making one or two areas really, really good. For example (minor spoiler ahead), there is one character death in the movie that is supposed to be a very sad, emotive moment. However, because the relationships hadn't been developed well enough up until that point, it just kind of falls flat.Contemporary films like 'Hunger Games' and 'The Giver' (both films that I enjoyed) do a better job of 'camouflaging' the young adult aspects (though not omitting them, obviously) in order to appeal to a broader audience. 'Giver' pulls not punches that it is a concept-driven film first and foremost, while 'Hunger Games' (like the book series) doesn't get into the real angst-y, drama stuff until later on in the series. Thus, I felt like 'Divergent' takes the action of the Hunger Games and the concepts of The Giver and combines them to produce...an inferior product of that melding.'Divergent' isn't a bad movie but any stretch of the imagination. It has a decent plot, the action always moves forward, and drama is present. It just won't captivate audiences beyond its target range of teenagers.",4,1,2,28 February 2017
Rocky IV," Is It East vs. West...Or Man Against Man?
","In the pantheon of Rocky films, this fourth installment has received both high praise and much malignment. It seems as if you either love it or hate it, with no middle ground. To me, this film not only succeeds, but succeeds on two different levels: Cold War analogy, and present-day boxing environment.For a basic plot summary, 'Rocky IV' sees former champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) trying to make a comeback against the freakishly large Russian newcomer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). When Creed fails in the attempt to win the East-West battle, the task falls to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone).The first level this film succeeds on is the Cold War analogy. This theme obviously played much better in 1985, but it still resonates to this day. It works because, on only one occasion (in Rocky's final speech), does it descend into sappiness. Otherwise, it tries not to make too much of a political statement.However, if you don't buy into the Cold War angle, this movie still holds up well as a mirror of the current boxing culture. With the Klitschko brothers ruling the heavyweight division with their powerful blows that mask their glass chins (just like Drago), they have booted any American challengers from the top spots. This is probably just a lucky coincidence on director Stallone's part, but perhaps he can be given some credit for a bit of foresight.Overall, this is a film that CAN be enjoyed, despite the objections of many. It takes a bit more suspension of reality than its predecessors to enjoy, but if you can buy in to the drama and spectacle, you will be cheering when the credits roll.",8,1,2,11 March 2017
Being John Malkovich," Not What You'll Think From The Trailer
","As a fan of mind-bending films like 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' and 'Memento', I was recommended this one on Netflix and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, after being intrigued by the trailer, I found that this movie is not all all what is advertised.For a basic plot summary, 'Being John Malkovich' sees an eccentric puppeteer (Jon Cusack) finding a portal that leads into the mind of actor John Malkovich (John Malkovich). Chaos then ensues when the experience is turned into a profit-making venture.Put simple, this is an artsy, 'concept' film if ever one was created. Many themes in the film are interesting and have potential to really intrigue, but all are eschewed in favor of oblique artistic expression. Basically, it is impossible to ever 'figure out' this film. The characters are outlandish, the plot is all over the place, and the themes are far too frequent and passing to piece together coherently.I liken the experience to watching Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'. The visuals are nice and the content seems thought-provoking, but you'll go stark raving mad if you actually try to figure everything out. For director Spike Jonze, the overall artistic expression far outweighs a coherent narrative.Thus, if you are a fan of out-of-the-box, visually striking film-making, this will be your 'Citizen Kane'. If, however, like me, you prefer some sense and stability, you will be disappointed (especially with the way it is advertised).",4,1,2,11 March 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Has Now Surpassed Bond In Terms Of Rollicking Action Fun
","I'm not usually the type that gets all too excited about action/adventure romp, but for the past, oh, 20 years of my life I've always been excited for the next James Bond movie to come out. My one indulgence in the genre. In recent years, however, that franchise has gone a bit stale, allowing the Mission Impossible franchise, including this 'Rogue Nation' installment, to take the crown of best action movie.For a basic plot summary, 'Rogue Nation' sees the IMF being shut down by the CIA Director (Alec Baldwin) right as they are on the verge of taking down the shadowy Syndicate, a network of crime baddies run by the mysterious Lane (Sean Harris). Now more off the books than ever before, the IMF team of Hunt (Tom Cruise), Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Luther (Ving Rhames) must track down Lane before they are out of time and resources. Lending a helping hand (or is it?) is British double-agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who seems to be playing all sides at once.Obviously, any 'Mission Impossible' movie (especially those still under the helm of JJ Abrams' Bad Robot productions) is going to be judged on how riveting and pulse-pounding the action scenes are. 'Rogue Nation' doesn't fail in that category one bit! From the opening scene of the film, which sees Tom Cruise perform one of the craziest stunts I've ever seen in a movie, the action scenes will blow you to the back of your chair. They are slick, have a great backing soundtrack, but also don't go on forever and ever. It never feels like the film is just a few extended action scenes cobbled together. Each action montage has a purpose.Along those lines, 'Rogue Nation' manages to good from 'okay action romp' to 'really entertaining flick' due to the fact that it's able to weave an actual story into the proceedings. Not only that, but it's a story that will legitimately have you intrigued and guessing as to how everything will turn out. This is where the franchise really separates itself from the recent Bond efforts. Those films haven't had a great story since 'Casino Royale', and before that it was 'Goldeneye'. That's two in about 20 years. Every since Bad Robot took the helm of the MI series, the three films have gotten progressively better.One final quick note about the MI/Bond comparison: These movies are far better at using female protagonists as well. Whereas the concept of 'Bond Girls' is now at odds with the culture at large (unlike the franchise's heyday in the 60s and 70s), the MI films are able to utilize a sexy female lead who, at the same time, isn't just eye candy waiting to be bedded by the hero.So, despite the fact that Bond movies might still have more name recognition and gravitas behind them, the MI flicks have slowly crept up and taken their place as kind of the action/adventure romp. 'Rogue Nation' is slick, smart, funny, a spectacle to watch, and even has a story that will keep you engaged. Hey, isn't that what the Bond franchise used to be able to do?",8,1,2,25 February 2017
Jarhead," Can A Movie About Boredom Really Be Good?
","A few weeks prior to watching 'Jarhead' in its entirety, I saw some clips of it on television and thought that perhaps it would be the 'Rambo' of our generation. Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.Basically (Spoiler Alert), the plot of Jarhead follows a Marine Unit (focusing on one solider played by Jake Gyllenhaal) that is called into active duty during Operation Desert Storm. However, 'action' is the furthest thing from the minds of the Marines, as they (in the words of their commanding officer) do nothing but 'train, hydrate, train, hydrate some more, and maintain a constant state of suspicious alertness'. Even when the unit does get the opportunity to carry out a designated mission, they are quickly and easily booted aside by the ever-popular air attacks. As the Gulf War ends, the entire unit has not fired a single shot in aggression throughout the entire campaign.This film did one major thing right, but also seemed to generalize about a number of things that I did not appreciate:What works is the focus on Gyllenhaal's character and the mind-set the he embodies through the entire process. He is pretty much lost when he enters the Marines, but then goes (in stages) from being utterly confused, to angry for enlisting, to ready to fight, to confused once again about his role in the entire process. Though uncomfortable at times (as we prefer to think of our returning soldiers as no less than out and out heroes), it was interesting to see a sampling of the emotions that likely beset our young men and women serving abroad.The main reason the film turned me off a bit, though, is the generalization it made about the U.S. military. Sure, I understand that the ground troops may not have been as effective in a war fought out in the desert, but I cannot bring myself to believe that all military life (while not bombing the crap out of something from above) is boring and pointless. The Marines are still an elite combat unit that serves their country to the utmost, and I don't believe for a second that they find their task to be as boring or inane as director Sam Mendes portrays it. It almost seems as if Mendes (although not overly preachy about it, which was good) was using the example of the Gulf War to cast a pall over the entire current military structure/usefulness.Thus, while Jarhead is a decent film that touches on some uncomfortable social/personal issues surrounding enlistment in the U.S. military, it ultimately fails to live up to my 'next Rambo' tag due to a few over-generalizations that could very easily be used to unfairly steer audiences into an anti-military frame of mind.",4,2,3,11 March 2017
Dunkirk," Something Different From Nolan: A New Kind Of War Film
","Until this point, film director and all-around mastermind Christopher Nolan has made epic character films. Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar...that were all epic in terms of character arc or story. Heck, Nolan even created the grittiest, true-to-real life Batman the world has seen to this point.With 'Dunkirk', however, Nolan really goes back to his film roots: that of a cinematographer. He's no stranger to widely professing that the love of film, camera, and shot construction are what appeal to him most about film-making. While he usually has at least a hand in his films' screenplays, it is generally assumed that brother Jonathan (now of 'Westworld' fame) does most of the heavy lifting in that department. Flying solo (w/o Jonathan) on 'Dunkirk', it is clear that Christopher means for this new film to almost completely be told in a visual fashion. Whether that style appeals to you will determine your overall enjoyment of the experience.For a basic plot summary, 'Dunkirk' tells the story of the famous 1940 WW2 scenario in which thousands of Allied soldiers are trapped on the beach at Dunkirk waiting for evacuation. The film tells this story of survival via three different lenses and time frames: -The Mole (land): Two young soldiers, Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) & Gibson (Aneurin Barnard), meet up on the Dunkirk beach and make an unspoken pact to find a way to escape onto one of the rescue boats. In their efforts, they run up against a number of obstacles, along the way picking up another friend, Alex (Harry Styles), in which to abscond with.Paralleling the escape attempts of the young soldiers are a number of conversations between military officers Commander Bolton (Kenneth Branagh) and Colonel Winnant (James D'Arcy), effectively framing how mammoth of an evacuation effort will be needed to not still be trapped like sitting ducks when the enemy arrives.-The Sea: Boats from the British mainland (just 30 miles or so from Dunkirk) are being commandeered to help with the rescue effort, but Mr. Dawson (Mary Rylance) sets out with no military presence on his boat. Joining him are son Peter (Tom Glynn-Carney) and the son's friend George (Barry Keoghan). Along the way, the yacht picks up a shell-shocked soldier (played by Cillian Murphy), who's express consent is to never return to Dunkirk again.-The Air: Patrolling the skies above the entire operation are Spitfighter pilots Farrier (Tom Hardy) & Collins (Jack Lowden), who must manage their fuel reserves, navigation techniques, and firepower to provide as much help as possible to ground/sea troops.In stark contrast to Nolan's previous efforts, 'Dunkirk' is not a character piece, nor is it reliant whatsoever on narrative twists or epiphanies. Instead, 'Dunkirk' is almost purely visual. Long stretches go by with almost no dialogue at all, and no backstory is given on any characters besides what is being viewed on-screen in the moment.'Dunkirk' is also a very interesting sort of war movie in that it has almost no distinguishable 'message' to it. It takes the event of the Dunkirk evacuation (one which must resonate deeply with Nolan, an Englishman himself) and portrays it via a visual medium. This is the furthest thing from a propaganda war picture. and also contains none of the overt violence of, say, 'Saving Private Ryan'. One almost has to re-train oneself to watch/appreciate a war movie like this one, since most of war cinema is more blustery and chest-pounding.For me, then, the 7-star rating comes because I so enjoy character-driven films (or ones that feature intriguing narratives) that this one set me aback a bit. I wasn't expecting this approach. Perhaps it will grow on me as I learn to appreciate the subtleties to Nolan's craft, but for now I'll peg it at a 'solid 7'.That being said, there is no doubt that 'Dunkirk' is an excellent film for what Christopher Nolan set out to accomplish with it. It features perhaps the best cinematography one will ever see on the big screen, and it is never 'boring', in the sense that something interest is always happening on-screen (even despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of dialogue or character-building).While 'Dunkirk' certainly will fall short when compared to Nolan's other more epic, sprawling masterpieces, it never was meant to be looked at in that way in the first place. This is Nolan taking a bit of a step back (at least in terms of writing) to expertly direct/craft a passion project. Viewed from that perspective, there is still much to enjoy and appreciate. I would highly recommend (almost command!) one to see this film in the IMAX format, as the video and sound are such important components of the overall experience.",7,6,9,28 July 2017
The Machinist," A Gripping Psychological Tale
","Ever wonder what might happen if your mind starts to betray you? That is exactly the conundrum portrayed in 'The Machinist'.For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale), a machine worker who is having trouble sleeping. As the movie unfolds, the mystery of his insomnia is slowly revealed, with the overall outcome (complete craziness or vast conspiracy) in doubt all the way up to the final scene.If you like movies that have a 'big reveal' in the end, then this should volt up near the top of your 'must see' list. The action may not be all that apparent in the middle portions of the film, but it is the process of the 'slow reveal' that will keep you interested in seeing how it all turns out.Along the way, the acting will also keep you emotionally tuned in. While Bale may be a bit one- dimensional (at least so far) in terms of choosing his roles, but what he does (the intense, brooding type) always turns out excellent. Without his stunning performance physically, emotionally, and psychologically, this film would be little more than a 'hook flick' (where the hook of the plot is the only thing that ends up mattering). Instead, you'll actually care about the fate of Reznick when all is said and done.Thus, I could easily give 'The Machinist' a 4.5 rating, but opt for 4 in this format due to the fact that it really isn't an 'instant classic'. However, it has all the elements of a solid film, and will keep you entertained throughout (especially if you are a psychological mystery lover!).",8,2,3,11 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," The Series Starts To Grow Up
","In the first two Harry Potter films, the plots/action are primarily geared towards a much younger audience than the medium. There are some 'tense moments' and drama in those films, of course, but it isn't until 'Prisoner of Azkaban' that the series really starts to grow up and deal with some more mature themes.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), an escaped prisoner from the terrible Azkaban prison, come to Hogwarts in search of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) for reasons dealing with Potter's deceased parents. Hermoine (Emma Watson) & Ron (Rupert Grint) still play large roles in the action (Hermoine especially in this one), while new Professor Lupin (David Thewlis) brings a new dynamic to the Hogwarts third-year experience.In terms of 'growing up', this film does so more with themes than content. There isn't any objectionable content in this one, but the themes and some of the characters present are sophisticated enough that younger children might have difficulty following them. Basically, this is the type of movie that seeks to maintain a fanbase and not create new followers based on this effort alone.As with the book, the ending portions of 'Azkaban' really serve to change the entire tone of the series. I won't spoil it for you here, but suffice it to say that it feels as if the saga could go in any direction now and not be limited by the more child-friendly plots.This is also the first movie of the series that has noticeable differences from the novel. Nothing too 'gasp-worthy' or anything like that, but certain parts of the narrative this time are indeed re- arranged to better suit the cinematic experience.Overall, 'Azkaban' might be even better as a movie than as a book because it skips over some of the 'fluff' found at the beginning of the book and gets right into the thick of things from the get- go. Despite a few key scenes that were explained a bit better by Rowling herself, this movie is the perfect complement to its literature twin.",8,2,5,5 March 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Tries To Do Too Much And Ends Up Failing At Everything
","After the incredible success of the 'original' Spiderman series (now known as 'the Tobey Maguire one'), director Sam Raimi & Sony could not agree on a fourth addition to that franchise. As such, Sony decided to dump Raimi and reboot the series again despite the very short time frame. While this movie will almost certainly rack up huge profits at the box office over the summer months, its utter lack of heart and anything original/interesting will eventually become known and be its undoing.For a basic plot summary, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' reboots the Spiderman franchise with Andrew Garfield as the title character and Emma Stone as Peter Parker's teenage crush Gwen Stacy. Also along for the ride is Rhys Ifans as a scientist working to perfect inter-species DNA mixing, which of course sets the stage for the battle between Spidey & The Lizard.There are so many things wrong with this movie that it is actually just easier to go over them in list form:-The main problem is that the direction from Marc Webb and thus the overall tone of the film is just wrong. It tries to be a high school drama, action/adventure romp, 'Dark Knight'-style hero film, and even a part goofy comedy all at once. It fails at all of these aspects because it just doesn't establish an identity. Whereas 'Dark Knight' works because it is so visceral and the original Spidey flicks work because they are more playful and light (like reading a comic book versus a graphic novel), this one falls squarely in the 'muddled middle'. -Andrew Garfield is a great actor, but his character is written so wildly inconsistent that it is literally laughable at times. There is no believe character progression or development whatsoever. One minute he is a goofy teenager, the next a brooding soul, and the next a punk, changing between the three for seemingly no reason at all. -This is too soon after 'Spiderman 3', plain and simple. The first 45 minutes are so get tedious because, well, we already saw this stuff not so long ago. I can completely see what Sony was trying to do, but it just should not have been done. As previously mentioned, it will make a ton of money (at least at first) but inevitably suck the life out of the franchise. -Finally, there are also some scenes in this film that will almost make you laugh out loud as to their ridiculousness. Maguire's Spidey always teetered on the edge of dramatic/campy, but this time it descends into stupidity. You never know what you are going to get from scene to scene.The only bright point of the experience: Emma Stone's performance as Gwen. Despite the fact that she is terribly miscast as a high school student, Stone gives her character at least some charm. It is more than can be said for anything or anybody else in the movie.Overall, 'The Amazing Spider-Man' was one of the biggest letdowns I have ever experienced in the cinema. For me, it is closer to 1.5 stars on the ranking scale. In a Hollywood era where superhero movies rule right now, this one is a complete and utter dud.",3,1,2,9 March 2017
Dallas Buyers Club," A Film For Breaking Down Conceptions & Boundaries
","Growing up in a conservative family, I was often sheltered from topics such as drug abuse and homosexuality. Out of sight, out of mind was the prevailing thought process in that type of upbringing. Upon getting educated and learning to think in my own terms, however, I've become much more open and understanding towards issue that may have slipped below my radar in years past. As such, 'Dallas Buyers Club' was an eye-opening film for me for the way in which it allowed me an entrance point (via Hollywood drama) into some hard-hitting issues involving drug abuse, the gay community, and even the American health care system at large.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of real-life figure Ron Woodruff (Matthew McConaughey), a very bigoted, prejudiced Texan who discovers (in 1985) that he has HIV. At first shocked and angry over even the association of having a 'queer's disease', Ron eventually begins to accept his diagnosis and delves into the research on how to treat it. At first, he associates with medical doctor Eve (Jennifer Garner), who is hopeful about an experimental new drug yet to be sanctioned by the FDA. When Ron discovers that the drug may just as well be poisoning him, however, he begins his own treatment plan that leans heavily on non-sanctioned drugs from Mexico. Along the way, he meets Rayon (Jared Leto), who challenges many of his conservative beliefs about the gay community and just human beings at large.I think 'Dallas Buyers Club' works so well (and garnered so much acclaim) because of the fact that McConaughey & Leto's characters are basically direct conduits to many viewers. There are many people out there (and I'll still put myself in that group) who view homosexuality from a distance lens, and Ron Woodruff (in the character's initially stages) embodies that perfectly. Once he is forced to interact with that community (primarily through Rayon), he comes to learn that it isn't the 'big deal' or taboo he once thought it was (a reaction that I think many people, including myself, have had as the gay rights movement continues to gain momentum). Director Jean-Marc Vallee hits all the right notes in crafting a story that is deeply emotional and can easily cross over into the lives of many viewers.Only helping matters is the incredible acting. Leto utterly transformers himself into Rayon, while McConaughey continues his rather surprising late-career transition from 'king of the silly rom-com' into a very accomplished dramatic actor. His physical transformation for the film is also quite stunning, reminding me of Christian Bale in 'The Machinist'. Clearly, these were 'all-in' roles for him & Leto. Garner holds up her end of the story nicely, providing a presence who is caught in the middle of her chosen profession (medicine's) way of doing things and Ron's more free-wheeling style (that seems to be producing better results). When all is said and done, 'Dallas Buyers Club' can be evaluated just as much as a film about the process of testing drugs for disease control as it can for anything else.Simply put, I'm glad I 'took a chance' on 'Dallas Buyers Club', as it turned into a very good experience for me. Many people will dismiss the film because of its subject matter, but to do so would be to rob yourself of a cinematic & dramatic treat. To be completely honest, the only reason I'm not giving the film an even higher star rating is because I'm just so new to many of the topics touched on that in many cases I'm not even ready to put all the pieces together quite yet. The bottom line, though, is that I very much enjoyed the experience both literally (as a solid film) and personally (expanding my social & culture horizons).",7,1,1,17 May 2017
Now You See Me," A Lot Of Flash But Too Little Substance
","Movies about magic have always intrigued me. I consider 'The Prestige' to be one of my favorite movies of all-time. There is just something about the concept of 'magic' that I think really translates well into the cinema. Unfortunately, 'Now You See Me' doesn't take full advantage of those possibilities.For a basic plot summary, this film sees a famous magician (Jesse Eisenberg), an up-and- coming conjurer (Dave Franco), a beautiful stage performer (Isla Fisher), and a mentalist (Woody Harrelson) team up to create the greatest performance of magic ever seen. When they supposedly rob a bank through the use of magic, they draw the interest of an investigator (Mark Ruffalo) and a 'magician debunker' (Morgan Freeman) to try and find out just what the heck is going on.'Now You See Me' is a movie filled with a lot of 'flash'. The chemistry between the actors is very entertaining, the action scenes are visually impressive, and the film moves along at a brisk case. Those watching it in theaters were likely consuming a lot of popcorn and getting a large number of thrills from the experiences.The trouble is (and what cements this movie as decidedly average) that the flick promises far too much than what it can actually deliver. For example, 'The Prestige' promises to bend the mind but then actually does it. Here, director Louis Leterrier promises similar things (he sets up the movie like it will amaze you in the end), but instead just provides a ho-hum ending.Thus, it isn't so much that the film is bad, per se, but rather that it promises the world and only delivers a sliver. You might like it for the pizazz and crackling dialogue/action, but don't expect anything mind-blowing (confusion is more of the end result).",5,1,1,5 March 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Mostly For The True Potterheads
","This will be one of my simplest film reviews on IMDB, as it is pretty clear to me along what lines this film will be split. Casual fans of the Harry Potter universe? They'll probably leave a bit disappointed or mystified. The true Potterheads (who know every nook and cranny of that universe)? My bet is that they'll come away with a much greater sense of enjoyment.For a basic plot summary, 'Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them' tells the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), a young wizard with a penchant for studying odd creatures. While just trying to conduct his studies, he gets mixed up in a power struggle between the muggles (or 'no-mags' as they are referred to here) and the wizarding community. His only ally seems to be Tina (Katherine Waterston). In a separate subplot, a wizard named Graves (Colin Farrell) is fixated on a boy named Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller), who seems to be more key to this storyline than his meek appearance would suggest.I consider myself a very casual fan of the Harry Potter franchise. I've read all the books, watched all the movies...and that's it. No multiple readings/viewings, no obsession over all the little details and names. To me, the Potter universe is more shallow than deep (my own experience here...I know that universe is indeed quite rich if one chooses to do a deep-dive). I enjoyed watching Harry and Co. grow up in their journey together, but that is about where 'Harry Potter' ends for me.As a result, there are two reasons why I found this movie to be just middle-of-the-road:1. Put plainly, the story of Newt Scamander just isn't as engrossing as the other previous material. Whether this was meant to be the case (more of a 'side quest' mentality) or whether the execution was flawed I can't say for sure, but to me this was a tale that just kind of meandered in terms of narrative. For a movie that is supposed to be the launching point for main character Scamander, it sure spends a lot of time elsewhere. One wonders, then, if Scamander was used more as an 'excuse' to re-enter the wizarding world than being fleshed out as a great character within it. Even the charming acting of Redmayne couldn't quite make me believe that I was seeing anything special in this case.2. This is the kind of movie that obviously is building off fragments of the Potter universe. Because most fans are of the obsessive variety, I think, there isn't all that much context given. The film just assumes that a base layer of knowledge is already present in viewers...a base layer that I did not posess. A good example of this: the reveal of the name Grindewald in the opening minutes of the film. That name did nothing for me, and nothing was ever really done to hammer the significance home. The film just assume viewers know the significance of his place in the wizard world.So, I think this is one of those reviews that leans more towards my subjectivity than perhaps the overall quality of the film. This isn't a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. Based on filmmaking alone, it is probably more of a 7-star film. However, in terms of its appeal to me personally, it gets dropped down a few pegs. I'm just not a big enough Potter fan to understand all the little inside winks-and-nods or 'easter eggs', and those are things that must be understood to truly be enveloped in the experience.",5,2,3,10 February 2018
Ocean's Eleven," A Fun Caper Film
","Too many times, films that contain a lot of 'flash' or 'style' are lacking in one particular area: 'substance'. This is where 'Ocean's 11' rises above the mold in its ability to put a fantastic plot to all the pizzaz.For a basic plot summary, 'Ocean's 11' sees master thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney) get out of prison and embark on a new thieving expedition...the Bellagio Hotel owned by casino mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). In order to tackle the monumental task, Ocean puts together a burglar's 'Dream Team' (starring the likes of Brad Pitt, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, & Matt Damon, among others).This movie primarily succeeds because it does so many things well. For example...-The casino-robbing plot line is intriguing and never really gets old or stale. Something is always happening that keeps your attention.-The characters create such great chemistry with each other that they are a joy to watch. The subtle humor embedded in the interplay between such characters also lends some needed lightness.-For those who like 'glamour' films (e.g. guys in sharp suits cracking wise, flashing lights, Vegas atmosphere, etc.), this one will remain in your video library!Overall, 'Ocean's 11' is a fun caper movie that does a lot of things well. It can be enjoyed by the 'thinking person', or the movie-watcher who just wants a large dose of excitement.",8,2,3,8 March 2017
Jackie," Hits A Number Of Great Beats, But Doesn't Add Up To Anything In The End
","As generally a fan of biopics, I was intrigued by the notion of profiling Jackie Kennedy. This film sets about to do that task with aplomb, featuring a quirky soundtrack, great acting, and a few great character beats. However, while watching the credits roll, I was disappointed that the overall experience didn't seem to add up to anything. I really never understood what the movie was supposed to be all about.For a basic plot summary, 'Jackie' is structured around an interview given by Jackie Kennedy (Natalie Portman) to a reporter (Billy Crudup) not too long after JFK's assassination. During the interview, the film flashes back to key points as Jackie is talking about them, from her iconic televised tour of the White House to the day of the assassination, and finally its aftermath with Jackie steadfastly planning the funeral arrangements.Let's start with the good: -Portman was wonderful as Jackie. There were definitely some very emotional moments in this movie, and they worked for me due to Portman's ability to pull them off. -Some great scenes where the movie re-creates their historical counterpart, like the White House TV tour and the JFK funeral. Almost uncanny how the effects can look so much like the original. -A quirky soundtrack that I felt really worked, including some great tunes from the 'Camelot' musical.The big problem with 'Jackie', however, is that I didn't really understand what the film was all about, or what message was trying to be conveyed. Most of the time, it just felt like a bunch of disconnected scenes instead of a coherent whole. While some of those scenes 'work' (are emotional/investing), others do not and feel odd.My exact rating for 'Jackie' would be 2.5 stars, but I can't even bump it up to an 'okay' 3 because it was such an odd viewing experience. The acting was solid, the music was interesting enough to rattle around in my brain for awhile, and it even emotionally moved me a couple of times, but everything felt so disconnected and nothing 'took' in the sense that it made me think about Jackie or the other issues in the film in any new light.Simply put: I want to like 'Jackie' more than I actually do, but when it comes right down to it the film just isn't all that good.",4,1,2,25 February 2017
The Usual Suspects," Looking For Something Different? Check This Film Out!
","Before I offer any analysis of 'The Usual Suspects', I would first like to say that (as is well know by now) the film has perhaps the most mind-blowing ending in the history of American Cinema. I have long been a fan of movies with endings that are shockers (The Sixth Sense and The Others stand out as favorites), but this movie took it to an entirely new level.I won't give away the ending here, but I will say that this film follows a narrative pattern such that guessing the 'big reveal' is difficult, as information is revealed in flashbacks, thus getting more complex as the story continues. However, many other Amazon reviewers have said that, after repeated viewings (I have only seen the film once), it IS possible to somewhat predict what is going to happen.I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but I knew I was not a fan of gangster/crime films, so I was a bit leery. However, the story is so expertly crafted that one (myself included!) completely forgets that the main characters are criminals and instead focuses on the plot twists and turns.So, I would highly recommend this film to two categories of viewers: First, those of you like me who have never seen this classic film until 'now' and are wondering what all the buzz is about, you won't be disappointed. Second, those of you who love surprise endings (even if you aren't too keep on cop/police dramas) will obsess over this film for weeks or months after viewing!",9,2,2,11 March 2017
Inside Out," Entertaining, But Not As 'On Point' As Other Pixar Efforts
","Toy Story...Wall-E...Up...Finding Nemo...etc. When a company (Pixar) makes films of that caliber, it is a difficult task to keep 'upping the ante' with subsequent releases. While 'Inside Out' is (at the very least) entertaining, it doesn't quite live up to the bar of greatness set by previous Pixar installments.For a basic plot summary, 'Inside Out' tells the story of an 11-year old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), who is moving from Minnesota to San Francisco. This is obviously a big change in Riley's life, and it is when we are introduced to the emotions inside her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), & Disgust (Mindy Kaling). All of Riley's outward emotions are controlled by these core emotions in the 'command center' of her brain. As Riley struggles to acclimate to her new home, school, and environment, these emotions struggle to figure out their place in the overall scheme of her personality.The concept behind 'Inside Out' is original and entertaining. It's fun/interesting to see our emotions represented like that, and it provides for both some very happy/uplifting, as well as very sad/depressing, moments throughout. In terms of original concept and interesting ideas, 'Inside Out' may actually be one of Pixar's best.However, I found the execution of those ideas to be only so-so. I had two complaints (this is coming from an adult perspective, of course) while watching the movie...1. When the camera 'pulls back' to see Riley interacting with her parents and environment, that is when this film works the best. However, a majority of the film is spent inside Riley's brain dealing with the emotions themselves. For example, a subplot involving Joy being separated from the command center takes up quite a bit of time. I just wish things could have been a bit more balanced.2. More so than any other Pixar film, 'Inside Out' seems to really 'go for the cry', so to speak. I've never been in a theater where so many sniffles and even outright sobbing could be heard. I have no problem with that at face value, as great films are supposed to grab at the emotions, but this one just felt expressly made to do so. I shed some tears at the end of 'Toy Story 3' and at the beginning of 'Up', but I really feel that was because those montages were so well-made and natural to the plot of those films. With 'Inside Out', at times I felt like the entire point of the experience was to have parents bawling.That being said, even though this one didn't rank as high as other Pixar efforts in my book, it was still fun to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique concept and really liked the parts where the emotions in Riley's (and her parents') brain directly influence conversations and interactions in the real world. Highly recommended for all audiences and (as usual) perfect for families. But be warned: if you are a parent, you might want to keep a few tissues handy.",6,3,16,27 February 2017
Quantum of Solace," I Understand The Effort...But Don't Like It
","For 40+ years, from Dr. No to Die Another Day and Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan, the James Bond formula remained basically the same: The gun-barrel opening, a lot of action, Bond says a few catchphrases ('Bond, James Bond' and 'Shaken, Not Stirred'), Bond gets the girl, and the film ends with the James Bond theme pounding in the background.A few years ago, however, a new Bond (Daniel Craig) brought a new formula (prequel) to the Bond franchise with Casino Royale, a gripping film that satisfies action fans as well as provides all the traditional Bond landmarks (albeit some in their inaugural forms) as described above. As Casino Royale ended, audiences were left feeling as if the 'Craig Bond' was well on his way to becoming the Bond we know and love.The trouble is, the ending of Quantum of Solace does the EXACT same thing...with little to no character development to back it up. For a basic plot summary, Bond spends the entire film trying to gain a measure of revenge for the death of Vesper, his girlfriend, in Casino Royale. A lot of fast cars, unbelievable chase scenes, and M-defying later, and supposedly Bond has reconciled his past and now able to move forward.Unfortunately, nothing particularly engaging happened during that time to make me believe as if Bond really is a changed man. I think the problem is that Craig is never really allowed to wildly emote in a vengeful fashion...he harbors the same stoic expression the entire film. I would have loved to have seen a Matthew Fox-esque emotive rant that LOST fans have come to appreciate, but it just never happened. The strange thing is that it wasn't just overshadowed by the crazy action scenes...those were pretty much balanced for a Bond film. Just no emotion whatsoever.Thus, while I appreciate this film's goal of trying to allow Bond to move on from his greatest tragedy, it just doesn't work. I would actually rather see a Bond film such as 'Tomorrow Never Dies' or 'The World Is Not Enough', installments that were heavy on the schtick and light on the plot, than this heavy film that didn't really get me excited until the Bond theme blared before the end credits.Die-hard Bond fans will watch this film regardless of what I say, but this is a movie that you can skip and really not miss any of the early-Bond character development that was so compelling in Craig's first Bond effort.",3,3,4,11 March 2017
Independence Day," THIS Is How Summer Blockbusters Should Be Made!
","When making a movie of the 'summer blockbuster' type, there a number of elements that must be present, such as action, adventure, a bit of humor, some sort of seemingly unstoppable enemy, & (if the film studio really cares) some interesting characters to latch onto. The coup de grace comes if the film is able to anchor itself around a significant moment/date either past, present, or future. 'Independence Day' scores high marks on all those elements.For a basic plot summary, the film sees planet Earth suddenly attacked by aliens bent on taking over the world. With the future of the nation on the line, President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) recruits military man Steven Hiller (Will Smith) & scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) to hatch a plan to defeat the sinister invaders on the weekend of the Fourth of July.To put it as plainly as possible, 'Independence Day' is primarily a rousing success because of the gravitas the 'Fourth of July' theme lends it. Without that holiday serving as the backdrop of the alien invasion, it just wouldn't be as epic and would likely fail to get viewers as invested. For example, a speech given by Pullman's character towards the end of the film will bring the hair on the back of your neck to attention due to it being given on our nation's birthday.To be fair, however, this film is well-constructed enough to stand on its own merits. Primarily, this happens because of the all-star cast and their character development on screen. Besides the three primary leads (of which Smith almost steals the show at some points), other accomplished actors like Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Robert Loggia, Randy Quaid, Adam Baldwin, & Vivica A. Fox round out the supporting roles. They all interact very well with each other and give the viewers some people to root for (a necessity in any quality invasion film).Overall, 'Independence Day' is easily a flick that can be enjoyed every July 4th (at the very least). It's one of those movies where you pop the popcorn, turn out the lights, and just get swept away in the scope of the action playing out on the screen.",9,1,2,9 March 2017
The Dirty Dozen," Does Just Enough For Younger Generation
","During the 1960s, a glut of films set in World War 2 America were produced. This was one of them. If your generation's pivotal moment was WW2, then you will enjoy this film very much. However, for the younger generation, it does just enough to stay on the right side of the 'boring line'.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the efforts of Army officer Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) to turn a ragtag group of convicts into a serious fighting force for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Many of the cons are played by popular actors/personalities such as Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, and Donald Sutherland, to name but a few.Like I said, this film does just enough to keep it from being boring. The characters are by-and- large entertaining, the plot is interesting enough to make you want to see the resolution, and the acting is solid.Here's the problem: it also has the pacing of a 60s movie (which will be a problem with the younger crowd). This movie could have been 30 minutes shorter and probably been just as good, as parts (like at the beginning and end) really got bogged down. Again, this is probably a generation-gap difference in film watching at play here, but I just wanted to point it out.Thus, though I wouldn't ever call this movie a 'classic' unless I'm referring to the decade in which it was made, it is decent enough to warrant a viewing if you are a fan of either WW2 flicks, or ensemble-cast blockbusters that showcase celebrities of that era. If you don't fall into either category, then you should probably stay away.",5,5,10,11 March 2017
The Butterfly Effect," Do You Like To Think While Watching?
","Do you like to be challenged while watching a movie? Do you like to really think about the repercussions of the actions transpiring on screen? If you answered 'Yes' to both of those questions, then 'The Butterfly Effect' is a movie for you!For a basic plot summary, 'Butterfly Effect' tells the story of the rather unique Evan (Ashton Kutcher), who as a child begins to experience strange blackouts that frighten mother Andrea (Melora Walters), whose husband had a history of similar experiences. As Evan begins to age, he discovers that his blackouts all revolve around a series of traumatic memories spent with childhood acquaintances Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). I wish I could delve more into this wonderful film, but to do so would give away too many spoilers and ruin the experience.There are two things to know about this movie right off the bat:1. Do not be scared away by Kutcher. No, he is not God's gift to thespians, but this isn't goofy Kelso here. He plays a very good role.2. Do not give up after the first 30-40, which will seem rather random and disjointed. If you can give the movie at least an hour, you will be hooked.This is very much a 'thinking person's' movie at its core. It deals with relativistic physics and the like. If that is not your cup of tea, then don't bother. If you love to be challenged by your theatrical fare, though, then this one will astound you!",9,2,2,6 March 2017
No Country for Old Men," A Very Unique Experience
","I have watched quite a few movies in my lifetime so far, but after viewing 'No Country For Old Men' I can honestly say that I haven't really seen too many like this before.For a basic plot summary, this film begins by introducing ruthless killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a man the likes of which Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) cannot even comprehend. When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a briefcase full of money meant for Chigurh, it kicks off a tense chase between all three parties.The reason 'No Country For Old Men' is such a solid film is because it is so deep on a number of different yellows. All three main characters are interesting and make you truly care (one way or another) about their actions, especially the viciousness of Anton (that is probably the one aspect of the movie I will always remember).Despite the fact that this is a very deep, thought-provoking movie, it is also quite sparse and terse (perhaps more sparse than any movie I've ever seen). There is no dramatic music (no contrived drama whatsoever, to be honest), no montage sequences, no character flashbacks, or any bells-and-whistles. It is completely 'straight down the line', so to speak. If you are a fan of that type of stark filmmaking, this will be one of your all-time favorite.All told, I enjoyed watching this movie for the amount of themes it threw at me and particularly the way it portrayed the 'new type of killer' in the modern world (even in the more traditional Texas). I prefer a movie with a little more obvious drama, so no five stars from me, but other than that I would recommend this to any fan of interesting cinema that does not conform to any other standard but its own.",7,5,6,6 March 2017
District 9," Too Weird To Be Good
","On most occasions, I am a fan of science fiction films. In the case of 'District 9', however, the experience was just a little too bizarre to appeal to me.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the future story of human-alien interactions. Instead of the traditional 'us vs. them' battle, we have exiled them to a slum-like area where corruption breeds. Unbeknownst to the humans, however, the aliens (Prawns) have been working on a way to go home, a method that is ultimately set in motion by a strange series of events.For extremely hard-core sci-fi fans, I think 'D-9' will really resonate. It is completely original, full of 'future tech', and contains enough action to satisfy the 'shoot 'em up' crowd. In an age of sequels and recycled plots, I have to give the creators credit for thinking up such out-there stuff.From a 'regular movie' standpoint, though, 'D-9' is just too fractured and strange to be considered a success. Besides the main character (and even so much more could have been done with him), this is a typical 'black and white' film. The bad guys are mustache-twirling fiends, while the good guys are portrayed as innocent of everything. I call this the 'Avatar Effect', and prefer a bit more ambiguity ('shades of grey') in the character development. Plus, just when (at times) you think the plot is really heating up, it usually gets bogged down in more laser blasts and military action.Thus, while not a terrible movie by any means, 'D-9' was just too strange and ultimately formulaic for this reviewer. If you appreciate 'left field' ideas, however, then you will like it more than I. 2.5 stars would be a more accurate rating, but I couldn't give it the benefit of the doubt for 3.",4,2,3,11 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Complete Fantasy Immersion
","'The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug' is a two hour and forty minute movie. When the closing credits rolled, however, this was my first thought: 'Bring on Part Three!'. Once again, director Peter Jackson managed to completely immerse me in the fantasy realm of the LOTR universe.For a basic plot summary, this movie picks up right where the first one leaves off. Fresh out of the Misty Mountains, Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Dwarf Co. continue to venture forward towards the Lonely Mountain. Along the way, they encounter:-Giant spiders in the forest -The woodland Elvish warriors led by Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly). -Escaping the Elves in the iconic 'barrels' scene. -The rising of Sauron and his army of Orcs. -The Lonely Mountain itself, inside which the mighty Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) dwells.Anyone's enjoyment of these movies comes down to how fully they are able to fully immerse themselves into the fantasy atmosphere. I am able to 100% 'buy in', so I love it. I enjoy practically every aspect of the picture, from the action/adventure to the music to the 'canon' material and even the dwarf bumbling humor. This is one of my favorite series of all-time, so I'm probably not being too objective here, but to me there is nothing here in this movie to shy away from.It has been awhile since I read the 'Hobbit' book, so I can't comment on how closely the movie follows the text, but from what I've heard/remember Jackson takes quite a few liberties. To be honest, though, I didn't care one iota while watching the film. I didn't feel as if any of the 'new stuff' was boring or dramatically changed the main storyline. Again, of course, that could just be because I'm not intimately acquainted with the novel as I once was.A final comment on this movie (and the series so far): The one thing I DO remember about the 'Hobbit' book is that it is very much more light-hearted than LOTR and almost more of a children's book. However, these movies (with their horrifying creatures and graphic battles) are not marketed for the kiddie set. Thus, I can understand why Peter Jackson would want to incorporate more mature themes into the storyline. Too much of 'book Hobbit' is childish (for better or worse).Overall, 'The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug' was one of my favorite cinema experiences of the year. Like I said, I could have EASILY sat through the entire third segment the same night!",9,2,4,4 March 2017
Remember the Titans," Superb Blending Of Acting & Story
","Sometimes, movies tend to be a bit out of balance when it comes to acting & story. Either the actors overshadow a middling plot, or the plot is solid but the actors don't live up to the billing. 'Remember The Titans', however, provides the perfect blend of acting and story to create an incredible tapestry of emotion from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, 'Remember The Titans' is loosely based on the story of Virginia public school TC-Williams going through the integration process in the early 1970s. When legendary white coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is replaced by black newcomer Herman Boone (Denzel Washington), the entire football program (and school in general) is thrown into the type of turmoil that integration would usually produce. At first, All-American defenseman Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst) refuses to play with his new black teammates. Helped along by the tenacity and shrewdness of Coach Boone, as well as a friendship with new player Julius Campbell (Wood Harris), Bertier and all his teammates face the choice of either coming together or having the whole program fall apart.Clearly, the deep racial themes in this film (quite similar to the more recently-produced 'The Help') are what drive the primary emotions derived from it. As a nation, integration is a topic that both embarrasses and inspires us...all at the same time. This produces a cacophony of emotion that makes for dramatic viewing. Director Boaz Yakin perfectly capitalizes on that emotionally potential by crafting an airtight script/story that never drags or stagnates. Something is always happening (whether on the field or off it) that gives the viewer something significant to ponder.Only helping matters is the fact that this is one of the most well-casted films ever created. Washington is masterful as Coach Boone (the pivotal role in the film), but even he is matched by the performances of the surrounding cast. Patton, Hurst, and Harris especially stand out, but are also joined by Donald Faison, Craig Kirkwood, Kip Pardue, Kate Bosworth, and Ryan Gosling. A very young Hayden Panettiere even gets in on the acting greatness in a magnificent role. By the end of the picture, you will feel as if you are right in the stands cheering on the Titans, as the characters will come so alive.Mention must also be given to the musical score, a combination of period pieces (a locker room rendition of 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' is a treat) and incredible orchestration from Trevor Rabin. An emotional film like this needed a great soundtrack, and it sure does deliver.Overall, 'Remember The Titans' is one of my favorite movies of all-time for its mixing of drama, comedy, historic themes, music, and characters that will absolutely come alive. I don't see how anyone can sit down and watch this masterpiece and not enjoy it.",10,1,2,8 March 2017
Toy Story 4," The Old Magic Is Largely Gone
","The first three Toy Story films comprise one of the tightest, most well-executed film trilogies of all time. Fans literally grew up with Andy and his toys (or could relate to the journey), and the ending of the third film is one of the best and most emotional in any franchise, animated or otherwise. When a fourth film was revealed to be in the pipeline, I was skeptical that it could never reach the heights of the original three. But Disney/Pixar kept reiterating that they had an idea that 'couldn't be denied', so of course I was intrigued to see what the next chapter would bring. Unfortunately, though not a terrible film by any means, I found Toy Story 4 to be largely lacking that 'old magic' that made the trilogy so perfect.For a basic overview, Toy Story 4 sees Bonnie playing with Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and the gang much like Andy had before her. But then Bonnie goes away to kindergarten and comes back with a new favorite: the craft-project 'Forky' (Tony Hale), a spork who is technically a toy (even in the most rudimentary form). Despite Woody's efforts to guide Forky through the new toy's identity crisis, Forky escapes and necessitates a man-hunt (or toy-hunt, if you will) to keep Bonnie happy on the family vacation. While on the chase, Woody meets up with old flame Bo Peep (Annie Potts), now a completely independent toy who survives on her own without an owner. Being pulled in multiple different directions, Woody must come to terms with his destiny and make hard choices he has never yet been confronted with.The main word I'll use to describe the experience of watching Toy Story 4: awkward. As an adventure tale it is a decent enough romp (Pixar can practically do that in their sleep), but in terms of the deep character analysis that the Toy Story franchise has become known for, this one just doesn't live up to the billing.The biggest problem with the movie is that it seems utterly fractured in what it wants to be. Is this a movie about helping a burgeoning toy come to grips with himself? Or is it a treatise on Bo Peep's independence vs. Woody's slavish devotion to an owner? Both of those are very interesting topics in their own right, but they don't function well together in a film that only runs about 100 minutes long. It really feels like one of those ideas should have comprised the core of this film, not both trying to exist concurrently. I think I would have preferred the latter approach, (as I do not believe the Forky character was a strong or important one, overall) really deepening the interplay between Woody and Bo Peep.Another problem that overall schism leads to is that besides Woody, Forky, and Bo Peep, all the other characters serve a pretty limited function. Buzz has a storyline that seems pretty asinine, while the likes of Jesse (Joan Cusack), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) are hardly given any lines or really anything interesting to do. Of the new characters added, I only found Duke Kaboom (Keanu Reeves) and Combat Carl (Carl Weathers) to be funny or interesting. Vintage doll Gabby Gabby (Christina Hendricks) has an arc that just doesn't play out very well, while carnival plushes Ducky (Keegan-Michael Key) and Bunny (Jordan Peele) feel odd and out-of-place.Of course, part of the overall issue with TS4 is still its three predecessors set such a high bar to clear. Most of the time, animate films directed ostensibly towards the children's market will not appeal to adults in nearly the same fashion. But Toy Story was the rare trilogy that had me laughing with and crying over the characters long into adulthood. Neither of those two things happened to me while watching TS4. I legitimately chuckled no more than a few times, and never did I feel that deep connection to the characters that I once had.So, despite being a perfectly acceptable animated film, 'acceptable' is just not enough when compared to the previous efforts in this series. My guess is that kids will still eat this one up, but adults may leave the theater feeling as if that 'old magic' has been sapped from the proceedings.",5,7,15,1 July 2019
Batman Begins," Back To Its Roots
","After the colossal flop that was 'Batman and Robin', the entire Batman franchise went into a bit of a lull. Rumors of a 'young Bruce Wayne becoming Batman' movie circulated for years, but nothing substantial was finalized. That is, of course, until this masterpiece from Christopher Nolan.Whereas the first two Batman films were very Gothic, and the following two were little more than action-adventure fare, this film delved into the important issue of 'why is a man driven to dress up as a bat?' The other films used the old, tired 'murdered parents' excuse, but Nolan realized that the psyche of Batman goes much deeper than familial matters.Thus, the plot of this movie centers on Bruce Wayne's transformation into the Dark Knight, an intriguing process that probes the very roots and civilized society and makes us question whether 'right' really is 'right'. The genius of this film, as a result, is the portrayal of Batman as a vigilante, not entirely accepted by all citizens of Gotham City. Is he a psychotic criminal, or a winged avenger who does what the police force can and will not? Can the primarily villain, The Scarecrow of comic book fame, be stopped by traditional means, or is Batman (despite his violent tendencies) actually needed to keep the peace? Those questions are what will keep this movie in your mind long after viewing.Lest I get too philosophical, though, this film contains its fair share of exciting chases and intense action, staples of summer superhero films. However, it is the almost seamless weaving of those elements into the overall storyline (not just pointless action like this film's predecessor) that combines into an overall thrilling experience.Finally, the acting in this movie is terrific. Christian Bale is easily the best Batman to date, while an ensemble cast of Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Homes, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are delightful to watch in each's respective role.Overall, this film is nearly the perfect amalgamation of intense action, superb acting, and thought-provoking plot. If you were intrigued by the first two Batman films but fell away from the franchise after 'Batman and Robin', you need to re-discover the true Dark Knight as represented by this film.",9,1,2,12 March 2017
The Fault in Our Stars," Will Hold Your Interest Even If You Don't Get Into The 'Sad Stuff'
","When I sat down to watch 'The Fault In Our Stars', I was worried that it would be nothing but a 'kleenex box flick'. Much like guys can be drawn to the theater with the right quota of explosions, special effects, and superheroes, the same can often be said for women only with really sad stories. That is kind of how this movie is marketed too...as a real tear-jerker. Luckily, the film does enough besides the 'waterworks' moments to keep your interest throughout. It isn't just all sadness and crying.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a teenager living with a rare form of cancer that makes her (in her own words) a 'ticking time bomb'. At a cancer support group (that Hazel usually loathes, of course), she meets Gus (Ansel Elgort), a fellow youngster who also happens to have a less-severe form of cancer. The two strike up a conversation, which leads to a friendship, which leads to a romance. Through a mutual interest in a mysterious author (played by Willem Dafoe), Hazel, her parents (played by Laura Dern & Sam Trammell), and Gus go off on a 'last wish' adventure to find this author and have him explain the ending of his most famous book.I won't go into any spoilers on what makes this movie so 'sad', but when you consider it is about two kids with cancer, you can probably put two and two together. If you are into emotional speeches and heart-stirring (for better or worse) scenarios, then you will indeed need a tissue box handy. However, even a 28-year old male like me was able to sit through the film without rolling my eyes or tuning out. Though coated with adolescent angst and high-profile teen actors, the kernel of emotion transferred from the core of the story (although I have not read the book, so I can't get into the differences) to the big screen remains poignant.'The Fault In Out Stars' probably gets a bit of a 'bum rap' right now because the general market is so saturated with these types of stories. I kind of compare it to 'The Giver' in that regard. Yet, one must remember that is was John Green's book that practically STARTED this entire genre; it just took awhile for it to get transferred to Hollywood.On my personal ranking scale this movie would get a 3.5-star ranking, but I'll bump it up to four stars here because it is a touching story with even a little comedy and light-heartedness thrown into the mix. While the core of the story may be very emotional, it isn't all 'doom and gloom'.",6,2,2,28 February 2017
Wreck-It Ralph," Tapping Into Arcade Nostalgia
","Before the invention of home video consoles or the smartphone games that are now so ubiquitous, there was the 'arcade generation', who controlled their pixels at the arcade via quarters. 'Wreck-It Ralph' taps into that 'arcade nostalgia' by focusing on the 'downtime' exploits of the arcade's heroes and villains.For a basic plot summary, 'Wreck-It Ralph' follows a premise very similar to 'Toy Story' in that when the arcade closes for the night, the characters behind the glass come to life. In one particular game entitled 'Fix-It Felix Jr.', the 'bad guy' character named Wreck-It Ralph (voice of John C. Reily) is having a rough time due to the fact that he is an outcast in his own game. One day, Ralph decides to game-jump (a move that can have devastating consequences on all parties involved) in a quest to prove that he isn't all bad. Along the way, he meets up with a 'glitch' named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman), who helps him to understand what being a 'good guy' is truly all about.Story-wise, this is pretty stock Disney fare. It is a feel-good message that, at times, can get a little predictable. The voice-overs match the characters, the plot moves along nicely, and overall it is just a well-paced film. It is full of enough sight gags and crazy antics to hook the kiddies in right away and keep their interest throughout.Of course, the new era of Disney animation needs more than that, so the 'hook' of this film is the nostalgia that adults will feel towards the arcade atmosphere. The film has cameos from many past games (Bowser, Q*bert, & the Street Fighter cast being the most obvious), as well as pays homage to the 'beeps and boops' and sometimes jerky motions of those old classics. For true fans of the history of gaming, there are enough 'easter eggs' hidden in the background, so to speak, to pique your interest and/or make you chuckle.Overall, 'Wreck-It Ralph' is a fine film filled with humor, heart, and (most importantly) video game nostalgia. It isn't quite as perfectly polished as some other Disney fare (thus the one-star deduction), but it still was fun to watch for both old and young.",7,1,2,5 March 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Easily Brings Back The Old 'LOTR' Magic
","When Peter Jackson adapted the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy from J.R.R. Tolkien onto the big screen, it became one of the most epic film series of all-time, full of drama, action, adventure, and fantasy. Now, 'The Hobbit' is back on the big screen (once again from Jackson) and manages to fully recapture that old magic.For a basic plot summary, 'The Hobbit' is the tale of Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is unexpectedly called upon by Gandalf the Wizard (Ian McKellen) to participate in a grand adventure to help a group of dwarfs regain their long-lost treasure. Along the way, the group encounters such creatures as trolls, orcs, goblins, and even a sad, slimy little creature who seems to have multiple personalities and is in possession of a very powerful item.Though many reviews of this movie were quite negative, calling it overblown, strange, or even outright boring, it had the complete opposite effect on me. As a huge fan of LOTR, I felt as if I had been transported back into that fantasy universe once again, and I loved every minute of it. Though the decision to break the one Tolkien book into three movies is controversial from a number of different viewpoints (from ticket sales to subject matter), I can now say that it will (at the very least) be fun to have two more theater experiences inside that LOTR realm.Perhaps the most interesting part of 'The Hobbit' experience, however, is the fact that its role in the overall scheme of things (in comparison to the book) is actually just about as opposite as it could be. 'The Hobbit' book was written as a tale for his children, and thus had a very lighthearted tone. When it was eventually published and achieved great success, Tolkien then decided to write the much more serious LOTR. However, seeing as how the LOTR series was put on the big screen FIRST, it was a challenge to the filmmakers to get the tone right: Stay true to the tone of the book (sometimes goofy), and the LOTR geeks will cry foul. Be too 'serious', and the book enthusiasts will discount you. Overall, I felt as if Jackson did a solid job of walking that fine line, as this one does have more fun moments than any of the LOTR pictures.Overall, I really have nothing bad to say about 'The Hobbit'. I have enjoyed the story since I was a child, so to see it done right on the big screen is a treat beyond imagination. To me, it was neither boring nor stale, but rather exciting and intense. Though strange that the journey will not be complete for nearly two years, I will thoroughly enjoy the next two films if they are anything like the quality of this one.",9,1,3,6 March 2017
The Princess Bride," I Don't See Why This Is An All-Time Classic
","I know that the reputation of 'The Princess Bride' is that it is considered to be one of the greatest fairytale stories ever put to film. Besides some understandably iconic characters, however, I just don't quite understand why it is such a classic, as I found it to be rather underwhelming in large portions.For a basic plot summary, 'Princess Bride' is a fairytale read to a young boy (Fred Savage) by his grandfather (Peter Falk). The tale focuses on Westley (Cary Elwes) and his quest to find his beloved Buttercup (Robin Wright), now engaged to be wed to Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon). Along the way, Westley meets up with a motley crew of characters that include the giant Fezzik (Andre the Giant), swashbuckling swordsman Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), and the annoying little imp Vizzini (Wallace Shawn).For the first 20-30 minutes of 'Princess Bride', I was engaged and interested. I liked the setup (story being read to a child), the Andre/Patinkin/Shawn interactions are hilarious, and Elwes has just the right sense of humor to pull off his role. There is also just a sense of irreverence that pervades the whole beginning of the film, setting the humorous tone perfectly.After that opening salvo, however, the film seems to trend towards a more conventional 'quest' tale, at which point my interest severely waned. Simply put, when the movie turns toward serious plot and away from goofy humor, it completely lost me. There were times where I was even outright bored, as the 'meat' of this fairytale isn't anything to write home about. To me, the goofy comedic tone of 'Princess Bride' is its calling card, and when most of that was used up in the early goings it fell flat afterwards.Perhaps my view of this film is colored by the fact that I never saw it as a child, but seeing it for the first time as an adult left me wondering why it is considered one of the greats. I'll always remember some of the iconic characters/moments, but taken as a whole 'Princess Bride' was mostly underwhelming for me.",4,3,7,19 March 2017
Saving Private Ryan," The Movie That Changed Everything
","It is quite rare that a movie comes along that has the ability to connect to its audiences on such a human level. For even the most 'advanced' film fanatics, the movie-watching experience is usually tethered to the moment: You watch the movie, either like it or don't, and then it slowly fades away as life intercedes. In the case of 'Saving Private Ryan', though, Steven Spielberg changed an entire's nations attitudes and actions towards a single historical event (WW2).For a basic plot summary, this film drops viewers (quite literally) into D-Day, with a prolonged battle scene that depicts the assault on Normandy. After the company led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) comes out on the other side, they are given a special mission from 'upper management': A mother back in the U.S. has just been informed that three of her sons were killed in action. A fourth, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is still active in the fight. Miller's goal? Get Ryan out of the war and back to his mother. Is all this effort worth it for one man? Will anyone make it out of the war alive? Those are the questions that Ryan and his men grapple with on the road to find Ryan.When 'Saving Private Ryan' premiered in the summer of 1998, many veterans were so moved by the opening D-Day sequence that they had to leave the theater and compose themselves. It was that much of an emotional experience for them, yet Spielberg treats it with such respect that it never seems like 'emotional sabotage' or anything like that. It was just the first time that audiences had ever been treated to such a graphic, true-to-form visage of battle. No disrespect to any of the war flicks that preceded it, but 'Ryan' didn't pull any punches.Like I said, this is a movie that changed perceptions. After viewing this visceral film, many children and grand-children of WW2 vets began asking their parents/grandparents about the war experience. While an uncomfortable topic, to be sure, it was a dialogue that needed to be opened in order to better understand the members of the 'Greatest Generation'. For so many years, WW2 vets had lived 'in silence', so to speak, about their war experiences, only relating to their war companions (as they were the only people who could relate). What Spielberg did, though, was bring the topic to the forefront of conscious, allowing WW2 vets an avenue for relating their experiences to the current culture.If I were to start a list of the most important movies ever made from a cultural standpoint, 'Saving Private Ryan' would perhaps top that list. Not only does it have great action/plot/characters from a film-making standpoint, but it is an experience that can stick with a person forever and change lives.",9,2,4,4 March 2017
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Not My Cup Of Tea, But Good At What It Does
","Of the hundreds of movies I have reviewed so far, 'Ghost Protocol' is one of the most difficult to assign a star ranking. Why? At its core, MI-4 is an action movie through-and-through. Judged solely by those characteristics, it is probably a four if not five-star effort. The problem? I'm not a big fan of films that feature action and little else.For a basic plot summary, 'Ghost Protocol' sees the IMF shut down due to a failed mission and operating under 'ghost protocol' (no government involvement whatsoever). As such, the team of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), & William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) must go it alone in foiling a Russian nuclear plot.What this movie most certainly does right is that it captures the essence of what 'Mission Impossible' really is...action, adventure, crazy stunts, gadgets, and intense special effects. From its TV beginning, 'MI' has always been strictly rooted in 'spy film' characterization, and director Brad Bird (along with producer JJ Abrams) really nail that tone in 'Ghost Protocol'.At the same time, though, this movie has a very limited scope. Either you like that kind of film- making...or you can only appreciate what it is trying to do (hence my three-star ranking). I mean, in terms of plot, 'MI-4' is about as generic a spy plot as one can concoct. It is the type of film where the plot serves only as the vehicle for the next chase/fight/explosion/cool gadget. Again, it comes down to personal preference.One thing that made the movie quite bearable for me, though, was the superb acting performances (especially from the auxiliary cast). Cruise is solid, but is nearly upending in the acting department by Renner (who I wish would have been given more screen time) & Pegg (the spot-on comedic relief that a film like this so desperately needs). Paula Patton? She proves that she can kick a little butt as well as seduce the high-class gentlemen with the best of them (!).Overall, I appreciated what 'Ghost Protocol' was trying to do in terms of movie-making, but because of personal preference I can't bring myself to truly enjoy it in a thorough sense of the word. I liked the 'little stuff' (acting, comedy, etc.), but the 'big picture' (no plot, all action) made it nearly impossible for this one to vault to the top of any 'best of' lists of mine. Enjoy it for what it is worth.",5,1,2,10 March 2017
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Jurassic Park II: The Lost Plot
","The first Jurassic Park film worked because it focused on the morality of the entire situation, with the dinosaurs playing a supporting role (though quite a large one, considering the incredible visual effects). Unfortunately, the sequel does not hold true to this formula, and instead has idiotic characters doing inane tasks, all the while showcasing the roaring dinos and, in the end, turning into little more than Godzilla.For a basic plot summary, 'The Lost World' reveals the existence of another island, not disclosed in the original, where the dinosaurs were originally 'bred' and now live in their own contained environment. Of course, bloodthirsty, money-hungry poaches are out to destroy the ecological paradise, so Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), the only significant character to reprise his role from the original, and girlfriend Dr. Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) are sent in to investigate. As expected, things go awry and a certain key species of the dinosauric terrors ends up a bit close to home for comfort.The trouble with this film is that it has absolutely no semblance of a plot. None whatsoever. Whereas the original really inspired viewers to think about the morality at stake in Dr. Hammond's experiments, this sequel only focuses on the 'oohs' and 'aahs' at the incredibly life-life dinosaurs to be had by potential viewers. In fact, by the end of the film, the script has devolved into nothing better than King Kong or Godzilla fare.That being said, I will give this film two stars instead of one because, gosh darn it, those dinos ARE pretty impressive! Though a bit of the 'wow' factor has worn off since the first installment, when the T-Rex roars or the Velociraptors begin preying, the hair on the back of your neck will stand up once again. I honestly don't know if the effects could be any better, even in today's Hollywood.Overall, though, this is a terribly constructed sequel that focuses on all the wrong things. It opened to tremendous hype and made a lot of money initially, but the passage of time has shown it to be quite subpar. I'm amazed that a film directed by a legend such as Steven Spielberg could turn out so vapid.",4,32,50,11 March 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Apes More Enthralling Than The Humans
","In the original 'Apes' films, the one aspect of those movies that could legitimately be improved upon is the special effects and ape character presentation. Though the outlandish ape costumes were state-of-the-art in their day and give those films part of their homely touch, today's CGI can bring so much more 'realism' to science fiction scenes that could never have been dreamed of 40-50 years ago. 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' does just that, but unfortunately gets pretty much everything else wrong.For a basic plot summary, 'Rise' focuses on two 'individuals': Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist developing a cure for Alzheimer's disease who discovers that its effect on apes is extraordinary. One ape in particular, Ceasar, gains such increased intelligence from the experimental drug that he leads his fellow simians in a revolt against the humans keeping them in captivity.As I previously mentioned, the special effects are the hallmark of this flick. Whereas the 'Apes' of yesteryear (especially the late sequels) struggle to visually depict an ape rebellion, 'Rise' nails that scenario and makes it impressive to behold.The main problem holding 'Rise' back, though, is the acting (or lack thereof) from the humans in the film. James Franco is utterly uninspiring and wooden in what needed to be a key role, and that malaise seemed to trickle down through the auxiliary cast members. By the end of the viewing, I didn't care whatsoever about the human element, instead getting antsy to just see more 'ape stuff'.Also, in referencing the 'Apes' cannon, 'Rise' is so-so. Some lines/moments are epic and true to form, while other plot points stray far away from the established material (for better or worse).Thus, I consider 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' to be a decent re-imagining of the chronological beginning of the 'Apes' saga. It is too uneven to be any kind of classic, but does warrant a watch from sci-fi junkies or 'Ape-heads'.",5,1,2,11 March 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Gets Everything Right Except An Overall Point
","In watching the trailers for Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood, they promise an incredible period piece set in 1960s Hollywood. If that is your primary reason for watching, this film may just speak to your very soul. If you want a deeper story with more of a point to it, however, you might leave this experience feeling somewhat disappointed.Ostensibly, this movie tells two concurrent stories that eventually overlap with each other: Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an aging former Western star who is struggling to get acting work and stay relevant. The same goes for his stunt man Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), who chauffeurs him around and is somewhat of a confidant. At the same time, young actress Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is experiencing a rapid climb to LA success. As I said, eventually these plotlines converge when the Manson Clan begins to factor more heavily into the story.In terms of aesthetic, Once Upon A Time... absolutely hits it out of the park. The music of the time provides an incredible soundtrack, the cinematography is impressive (as per the usual Tarantino style), and the entire experience convincingly plops the viewer into 'Old Hollywood'. The actors all nail their parts (with a star-studded cast like this, how could they not?!) and during the entire 160 minute runtime there is a good mix of drama, comedy, and action/adventure. A special shout-out needs to go to Margaret Qualley, whose hippy/cult character utterly commands every scene she is in.The main problem I had with the movie, though, was that it didn't seem to have much of a point or purpose from beginning to end. There is so much going on from scene to scene that viewers will likely not be bored, per se, but there seems to be an ephemeral approach to the overall goals of the picture. It just sort of drifts from plot to plot, with the aesthetics filling in the gaps instead of well-crafted, plot-driven writing.In fact, I would argue it commits a rather cardinal sin of assuming the audience knows the story behind some of its true-to-life figures (such as Ms. Tate). Because director Tarantino often plays with or subverts the expectations of the history books, there is a heavy degree of assumption that audiences will know 'the facts' of what actually happened to these historical figures. I did not know this information, and thus was rather confused by some of the in-film events taking place (especially the ending). Now that I've done a little post-credits research I understand better what Tarantino was trying to accomplish, but during the watching experience I often found myself lost.Overall, I can say I was entertained by Once Upon A Time... but little more. It was fun to see such star acting power all grouped together, and Tarantino is good enough at his craft to make sure it doesn't completely fall apart, but there was a lot here that I just couldn't relate to because it assumed a modicum of knowledge that I did not possess. Maybe I'm the outlier here and others will follow along better than me, but for the under-40 set I feel like it might be a challenge without a history brush-up.",6,10,20,29 July 2019
Gone Girl," Captures Most Of The Book's Bizarre Mystery
","Its a little tough for me to watch/review 'Gone Girl' seeing as how I had already read the book. For a plot that relies heavily on surprise and misdirection, I already knew what was going to happen, and that obviously makes it a different viewing experience. I was very impressed, however, by how the film was able to capture the basic essence of the Gillian Flynn novel (maybe it helped that Flynn wrote the screenplay herself!).For a basic plot summary, 'Gone Girl' tells the story of Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike). One day, Nick comes home and finds his home a crime scene and his wife gone. Lead investigator Rhonda Boney (Kim Dickens) immediately suspects Nick, whose Ivy League nature and shadowy past make him seem like a viable candidate for the crime. Despite initial support from sister Margo (Carrie Coon) and Amy's parents (played by David Clennon & Lisa Banes), the case against Nick seems to keep getting worse and worse. Could he really have killed his wife?This movie excels in a number of different areas. Flynn is able to seamlessly move the plot from book to screen (no easy task) while still retaining its creepy nature and haunting themes. The casting is also spot-on. Affleck is playing practically the role he was born for (good-looking suave guy who may just be a complete slimeball) and Pike is similarly perfect in her own way. I can see why this one was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.Of course, probably the hallmark of 'Gone Girl' is that besides spinning a great mystery, it also provides some subtle (or not-so-subtle) commentary on the institution of marriage. I wish I could say more, but to do so would be the ruin the surprises for those who haven't seen it yet. For lovers or young newlyweds watching this movie, I can easily see it producing either deep conversation or very awkward moments.Why not a five-star rating? Well, my exact ranking would be 4.5 stars. I have to go the other direction, however, primarily because I HAVE read the book previously. If there is one thing that doesn't transfer over it is a little bit of the deep commentary on relationships in general. 'Gone Girl' is a psychological thriller, so some of that is probably better examined in the slower pace of the novel. While reading the book, I was completely sucked in and entranced. Most of that carried over into this film, but not necessarily ALL of it.Of course, I can easily see someone who doesn't know the plot ranking this a five-star effort all the way. It manages to tell an individual mystery filled with over-arching themes about relationships and marriage. A truly haunting tale.",7,3,4,1 March 2017
Get Out," An Inventive Horror/Thriller
","Though I won't give away any major spoilers in this review, the main reason I clicked the 'spoiler alert' button is because of this: I don't usually like telling people that a film will have an ending they can never imagine. 'Get Out' is one of those types of films, however, and it can't really be discussed with referencing that very fact.For a basic plot summary, 'Get Out' sees Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) & her boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) going to do the first 'meet the parents' routine with the Armitage's. Upon arriving, Chris (initially worried about being 'the one black guy') starts to realize that things are a bit strange. Rose's parents Missy (Catherine Keener) & Dean (Bradley Whitford), as well as brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), all act strangely around Chris, and things take a deeper turn when all the other black people (maid, groundskeeper, family guest, etc.) act odd too. Is Chris just jumpy about the new setting...or is something strange actually going on?The thing I like the most about 'Get Out' is that it creates substantial doubt in the mind of viewers. In terms of horror/thriller flicks, I find that to be a key element. Until the last 15-20 minutes of the film, you won't have a good read on any of the events. Too often, scary movies purposely put themselves into convenient boxes (likely for marketing purposes). Fortunately, 'Get Out' does nothing of the sort. Instead, director Jordan Peele revels in keeping things a mystery until the very end.Another thing to like about 'Get Out' is its sly social commentary. Made in a decade fraught with racial tension, Peele addresses those ideas (sometimes seriously, sometimes with humor) but is frank about them. This allows the film to work almost as much as social commentary as it provides tension.Of course, that brings us to the ending: You absolutely won't see it coming. I'm confident enough to reveal that because it is indeed so unique. Again, the credit goes to the writing & Peele here, as the film is set up in such a way that literally anything can happen in the end. When 'anything' literally does happen, then, it is quite a sight to behold.While 'Get Out' isn't the best thriller I've ever seen (a character supposedly providing comic relief really took me out of the experience from time to time), it is certainly the most original in quite some time. It uses deft social commentary, and air of mystery, and an atmosphere of tension to lure in viewers. By the end, you'll be totally invested in the characters and their predicaments.",8,10,18,27 May 2017
Frozen," A Lot Of Fun
","Because I have younger siblings, I am exposed to Disney animated movies more than I probably would be by myself. Usually, when I see one of the better ones, I can pinpoint exactly what I like about it. For Toy Story, it is the ability to relate to the characters. In Tangled, for instance, it was a story so sad you couldn't help but root for the protagonist. With Frozen, however, I can't put my finger on 'one reason' why I liked it so much...it was kind of more of a 'package deal'.For a basic plot summary, Frozen tells the story of two sisters born of royal blood, Elsa (Idina Menzel) and Anna (Kristen Bell). While very close as young sisters, the women drift apart in adulthood after an accident in which Elsa's ice-creating magical powers hurts Elsa. Determined not to hurt anyone ever again, Elsa absconds the royalty and creates her own castle far into the wilderness. The only problem? She has left her hometown in a perpetual state of winter. As such, young sis Anna sets out to find Elsa and set things right, along the way meeting up with mountain-man Kristoff (Jonathan Groff) and snowman-come-to-life Olaf (Josh Gad).Like I said, there is no one thing about this movie that really makes it stand out compared to previous Disney efforts. It is just the combination of everything that make it such an enjoyable experience. The story is engaging, the characters are interesting, humor abounds, the visuals are astounding, and the music is enthralling. There never seems to be a lacking moment in the whole 104-minute spectacle.So, despite not being able to hang my hat on that 'one attribute', Frozen is primarily such an enjoyable experience because it has a little bit of everything. I could see myself watching it again in the near future!",8,5,8,2 March 2017
2012," Epic, Yes, But Focuses On All The Wrong Things
","When I thought about all the hoopla that surrounded the release of this film, I figured that the film would delve into the Mayan culture (which predicts the now-infamous world-ending date) and how people of the Earth would interpret in during that fateful year. Instead, I got a disaster film...nothing more.Of course, if you a fan of the 'disaster film' genre, then this may be one of the best films you see all year. The special effects are incredible, and action is non-stop, and a few scenes (like the crumbling of the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brazil) that are iconic. It compares favorable to other movies of its type, including 'Titanic' and 'Cloverfield'.Where this film falls short of those films, though, is that fact that its appeal ends at 'disaster'. The characters (at least the main ones) are almost blatantly ripped off from 'War of the Worlds' (the Tom Cruise version) in terms of family dynamics, and by the end of the film you still don't find yourself really rooting for them with any heartfelt emotion. Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story. As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the 'Arks' are chosen. What could have been a fascinating character study in humanity instead is completely glossed-over by explosions and destruction. Imagine The Dark Knight without The Joker, and you pretty much get the picture.Thus, unless you are a huge fan of incredible special effects and prolonged action sequences, I would advise you to skip this effort, as it just doesn't bring any more to the table than that.",4,1,3,12 March 2017
The Number 23," Intriguing, If A Bit Manipulative
","The best kind of psychological thrillers are the ones that drop hints throughout the movie about what the ending might turn out as. Then, there is the 'next tier' of thrillers, where the ending is a bit more manipulative in the sense that it is dropped on the viewer suddenly and cannot be reasoned out along the way. 'The Number 23' falls in that latter category. It isn't an all-time great psych thriller (like The Sixth Sense, Memento, or Jim Carrey's own Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), but it does have enough mystery an interesting moments to be an entertaining watch.For a basic plot summary, 'The Number 23' tells the story of Walter Sparrow (Carrey), whose wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen) finds a book at the local bookshop entitled The Number 23. While Agatha looks at the book as 'interesting fiction' and nothing more, Walter becomes obsessed with it and the number it idolizes. A colleague of Walter's, Isaac French (Danny Huston), tries to dissuade Walter of his obsession, but that only serves to heighten is paranoia about the way the story seems to be intertwining with his reality.If taken solely at face value, 'The Number 23' is a pretty good flick. It has an engaging mystery, Carrey is a great leading man, and the ending is indeed a surprise, to say the least. For those looking for a good psychological thriller from time to time, this one fits the bill.Here's the problem for certain viewers, though: This is my favorite genre of film (and thus I have a somewhat high bar set for it), and 'Number 23' doesn't quite measure up to the greats of that genre. It isn't a 'smart' thriller, if you will, but rather more of a manipulative one in the sense that the twists and turns are completely out of left field and not necessary germane to the story. It comes very, very close at times, but overall (under the direction of Joel Schumacher) it doesn't quite take that 'next step' into being a film I'd ever want to re-watch again.So, I think a person's enjoyment of 'The Number 23' will depend on their familiarity with the genre. If you aren't a pro, this one will get the job done. If you've 'seen them all', though, this won't be at (or necessarily even near) the top of the list.",6,1,3,1 September 2017
Good Will Hunting," Just Another 'Holden Caufield'
","After watching Good Will Hunting, I was struck by two similarities to other works of fiction (in this case, novels) that I had previously read: J.D. Salinger's 'Catcher in the Rye', and Stephen King's 'Rage'. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy either of those efforts, and didn't take to 'Hunting' any more pleasantly.For a basic plot summary, this film centers on young Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a mathematical genius (of savant proportions) who spends his time mopping floors at a local university before solving a complex equation left on a blackboard and catching the eye of a math professor (Stellan Skarsgård). However, Will is a troubled young man who lacks motivation, along with a history of violence, and thus is sent to therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams), who tries a rather unorthodox approach to salvaging the boy's unique talents.Although I can see why some people would like this film much more than I (due to the deep psychological themes), I have never been one much for the 'bratty youngster needs a character treatise to understand what he is going through' type of storytelling. To me, Will Hunting was an arrogant, unmotivated jerk in the beginning of the film, then a whole bunch of psychological terms/scenarios were thrown around, and now suddenly I'm supposed to believe that everything is okay? Not quite.To me, the most interesting scenes in this film revolved around Hunting's potential girlfriend (played by Minnie Driver). I actually felt that her relationship with Will (and her character altogether) were the high points of the film, not the 'tense' client-therapist scenes that were supposed to steal the show.I realize that I am probably in the minority here, but I really can't recommend this film to anyone besides those who love to be wowed by psychological scenarios/situations. I found it be pretentious and bloated to be otherwise.",2,2,5,10 March 2017
Room," Another Sincere A24 Success
","It seems like, more and more, the notions of a film being 'an exercise in film-making' and 'extremely thoughtful/entertaining' are the antithesis of each other these days. You have your 'Hollywood blockbusters', your 'art-house fare', and very little in between. That's why I love the effort that A24 studios (which produced this picture) is making to bring those concepts together. In the past, with films like 'Enemy', 'Prisons', and 'Ex Machina' A24 has succeeded in merging high-concept with pure entertainment. 'Room' is another success with flying colors in that department.For a basic plot summary (some spoilers), 'Room' tells the story of Ma (Brie Larson) and her son Jack (Jacob Tremblay). The pair are living in a space that is incredibly confirmed/cramped, and are being held against their will by a mysterious male figure. The only reality that Jacob knows is 'room', and Ma (after five years) wants to change that. So, they devise an escape plan in hopes of finally being able to revisit the world at large. Their plan does succeed...but only to a certain extant, as the rest of the movie is spent examining the culture shock in returning to their family and what that means for both Ma and Jack.First and foremost, what makes 'Room' such an intriguing film is that it lets the exposition play out quite nicely in the very beginning. In short, it shows the characters/settings rather than explain them. Much like Ma & Jack, 'room' is the only universe viewers will know for the first portion of the film, allowing the characters to take center stage in a fascinating way. There is Ma, who knows what is happening, and Jack, who doesn't know anything else besides 'room'. The conversations where she tries to get him to understand the complexity of the world beyond the four walls of their limited existence is almost worth the price of the ticket alone.In order for this to work, however, the acting has to be superb, and in 'Room' it truly is. Larson (who made her name in the equally brilliant 'Short Term 12') might take home some hardware for her stunning, emotional performance, while young Tremblay is very believable and apt as a boy going through something that few can even imagine. There isn't a wasted scene in the entire film, as every character interaction and nuance is imbued with significance and deep emotion.'Room' also manages to transcend its title by not following a predictable arc. I don't want to get into too mainly spoilerish details, but there is as much material outside of 'room' as in it, following Ma and Jack's struggle to integrate themselves back into society. These parts are just as deeply emotional as the 'room' scenes since, again, the heavy character development at the beginning sets them up to be so relatable. It will really make you think about the enormity of the entire situation...a jolting emotion considering the claustrophobic smallness of the 'room' setting.A final area in which 'Room' will engage audiences is the way in which the camera plays with the notion of space. In 'room', Ma & Jack are cramped, definitely, but it seems to be a livable space. There is a scene towards the end of the film, however, where they are back in 'room', and this time (within the context of the outside world) it looks so incomprehensibly tiny. It truly is all about perspective and mindset...and a wonderful director in Lenny Abrahamson.So, if you are looking for a cinematic experience that is equal parts mind-stretching, emotional, funny, and tragic, 'Room' fits all the bills. It has the polished feel of an Academy Award-type picture, yet the spirit of a movie that knows no bounds when it comes to characters, emotions, and settings. A24 has done it again.",9,2,5,26 February 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Even Better Than The Book (Because Of The Battles)
","I have read the LOTR trilogy on a couple of different occasions. Each time, I struggled to get through 'The Two Towers'. Was it because it is a bad book? Certainly not. However, Tolkien's tales of Middle Earth battles are better 'seen than imagined', so to speak, and that is where Peter Jackson comes in.For a basic plot summary, 'Two Towers' is split into three separate narratives:-Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest for the fires of Mordor. As they approach the black city, they are formerly introduced to Gollum (or is it Smeagle?!), the former owner of the Ring who has as many different motives in his mixed-up brain as one can imagine.-As Sauron and Saruman (Christopher Lee) unleash their armies onto the land of Middle Earth, the fellowship of Gandalf (Ian McKellen), now White instead of Grey, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must begin their stand in Rohan with the Battle of Helm's Deep.-Finally, wayward hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have quite an eventful film, eventually meeting up with the Ents (giant tree-people) and leading a motion to storm Saruman's fortress at Isengard.Whereas 'Fellowship' was all about adventure and laying the groundwork of an incredible story, 'Towers' takes a bit of a different tact but still manages to enthrall viewers for the full three hour run-time. While the battles fought in Tolkien's Middle Earth are indeed epic even in the novel, there is just something about seeing the seething Orcs & steadfast resistance that makes it all the more incredible. Though it has been nearly ten years since the film was released in theaters, very few (if any) movies since have created better battle-action scenes.Almost worth the price of admission alone, however, is the character of Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis). When Tolkien first created the character in his book 'The Hobbit', he painted a very horrifying picture of the sort of abominable creature Gollum must be. View computer animation and incredible voice acting, this film perfectly captures that creepiness and provides perhaps the best moments of the entire movie. Gollum is even given a sort of sympathetic turn, as only Frodo can understand how corrupting the power of 'The Precious' can be.Overall, 'The Two Towers' is not a letdown whatsoever from the first installment. The quest to destroy the One Ring continues to take new twists/turns, while viewers are also given an inside glimpse into what all the fighting is truly for...to save the great land of Middle Earth and all its inhabitants/creatures. There are very few films that can sustain my interest for a full three hours with no waning, but this is certainly one of them.",9,1,1,10 March 2017
Schindler's List," The Importance Of One Man
","When watching a movie like 'Schindler's List', there are so many ways that it can be appreciated. It's a history lesson, an intense drama, and a gripping character study all at once. For me, however, the film really hits home with the realization of the difference that one person can make in the grand scheme of things.For a basic plot summary, 'Schindler's List' focuses on Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a high- ranking member of the Nazi party during World War II. When the German Nazis invade Poland and begin rounding up Jews into ghettos, Schindler sees it as strictly a business operation, opening up his own pots-and-pans factory using Jewish labor. While raking in the dough on the backs of the Jews, however, Schindler begins to see the escalating brutality of the Nazis and is eventually appalled by their treatment at the concentration camps. Thus, he creates a list of workers that he ultimately hopes to protect from the brutality.As a history-based epic, 'Schindler's List' manages to capture the essence of the moment AND yet still be subtle about it at the same time. Director Steven Spielberg strikes the perfect balance between drama and realism. The acting performance from Ralph Fiennes as the Nazi Commandant is especially shocking for its ability to depict the brutality of those camps. Essentially, this is a movie that should be shown to American high school students at least once during their education for its ability to show the true horrors of the holocaust.Perhaps the true hallmark of the movie, though, is the character evolution of Mr. Schindler. He starts off as nothing more than a ruthless businessman, but over time (and it quite literally takes almost every minute of the film's 3+ hour runtime to come to fruition) he begins to realize not only the horrors transpiring around him, but also that he has the power (and thus the responsibility) to do something about it. To me, that was the most endearing message that I took from the overall experience.Thus, I consider 'Schindler's List' to be a masterpiece of American cinema (although, what should I have expected from Mr. Spielberg?!). It is compelling on both a historic and personal level simultaneously. Even though it is quite long, there are very few wasted moments.",10,10,15,7 March 2017
The Incredibles," A Bit Uneven And Lacking The Usual Pixar Strong Characters
","The legacy of the Disney/Pixar film collection will always (at least to me) be its ability to completely engross/entertain children and adults alike in a single sitting. While 'The Incredibles' will suck in the kiddies again as usually, this time the adults are left out a bit.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), a former superhero who is now adjusting to family life with wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), also a former hero. Instead of saving the world and fighting bad guys, they are now raising their three children Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and Jack-Jack the baby. When a new baddie comes into the picture, however, the 'old crew' (plus a few new 'kids') is needed once again.In terms of action and adventure, the 'Incredibles' is as good as any previous Disney effort. It is full of color and spectacle and will have the kids hooked within minutes. In this aspect, it is a very successful endeavor.The 'trouble' with this film, though, is that the characters just aren't as well-developed as other fare. For example, when you watch movies like 'Finding Nemo' or even 'Tangled', you really feel as if you are invested in the characters and their exploits. In 'The Incredibles', though, the characters are just present and not quite as well-developed.Perhaps the only caveat to the above paragraph is that if you have a family, the themes for 'The Incredibles' might hit a little close to home. Though I myself come from a large family, I do not have a family of my own, and thus have not had to go through the types of trials and humorous situations that this movie portrays.Thus, my experience with 'The Incredibles' was an uneven one in the end. I could appreciate some of the jokes and sight gags, but I never was really able to 'buy in' to the characters to the extent of other past Disney works.",5,1,1,4 March 2017
The Mist," Monsters vs. Human Nature: Which Is Worse?
","At its core, 'The Mist' (based on the Stephen King novella) is a classic 'humans trying to survive against monsters' tale. However, thanks to King's brilliant storytelling, a human element is introduced into the mix that takes the film to new psychological heights.For a basic plot summary, 'The Mist' tells the tale of a small American town suddenly attacked by a variety of bug-like creatures. After a terrible windstorm causes the town's residents to gather in the general store for supplies, they all find themselves trapped in the rather confined space as a curtain of mist blankets the entire city. Whenever someone ventures out into the mist, however, they do not return alive.There are two reasons why this film is so interesting/entertaining:First, the special effects and alien creatures will have you on the edge of your seat. One almost has to wonder if they did not inspire JJ Abrams' creature in the later 'Cloverfield' picture, as the films are very similar in that regard.What truly sets the film apart, though, is that it is as much about humanity as it is about monsters. As the bewildered townspeople struggle to determine their next move, all their personalities begin showing in crisis mode. There is the religious zealot, the rednecks ready to fight at the drop of the hat, the natural leaders, and the 'lemmings' willing to follow the loudest voice in a mob-like mentality. In typical King fashion, it is a tale of humanity's struggles more than the paranormal aspect.Overall, then, 'The Mist' is a great 'monster flick' also including large doses of human drama. It was a great Stephen King story, and the transfer to the big screen is almost impeccable. Unless you are a bit squeamish, you will find this interesting on both the 'horror' & 'psychological' levels.",9,1,3,7 March 2017
I Am Legend," No Resolution, But Still A Decent Film
","As I viewed this film, it quickly become clear to me that two very different themes are being explored by director Francis Lawrence in this film, one that works and one that does not:The first, more wide-reaching theme, is the fate of the human race, which Robert Neville (Will Smith) is working desperately to save throughout the movie. I can't tell you the state of humanity at the end of the film without spoiling some things, but suffice it to say that there is a good chance you will feel a bit let down by the lack of resolution to this theme.The theme that works quite well, however, is how Neville copes with being the 'last man on Earth'. His internal struggles and outward devices (such as talking to mannequins, for instance) that he uses to keep some semblance of his sanity are intriguing, and Smith is a well-rounded enough actor to portray the wide variety of emotions his character must express.Overall, then, this is a decent enough film (worth a rent), but lacks enough of a payoff in the end to be considered a real classic. I found this film to be much in the vein of J.J. Abram's recent hit 'Cloverfield', where little to nothing is explained or expanded on...viewers are just supposed to live in the moment. Yet, with the way that Neville's family is developed in this film (unlike the anonymous characters of Cloverfield), I think that the lack of a conclusive ending was more apparent.",6,2,3,12 March 2017
A Quiet Place," A Solid, Inventive Thriller
","Sometimes, it's just fun to see a movie about a concept you've never really thought of before. That's primarily where 'A Quiet Place' succeeds, playing on the concept of 'sound' (or the lack thereof) to craft a solid, inventive thriller.For a basic plot summary, 'A Quiet Place' tells the story of Evelyn (Emily Blunt) & Lee (John Krasinski) and their three children. Viewers are dropped into their struggle mid-stream, as they must live a life of almost total silence to avoid being hunted by invading monsters that hunt via a keen sense of sound. With Evelyn pregnant, however, it quickly becomes clear that the danger will be greater than ever before once the baby arrives.To me, what made 'A Quiet Place' an entertaining experience was how it differentiated itself from similar films by playing with sound/silence as almost a character unto itself. I had never seen (heard?!) this done in a film before. One of the children characters is deaf, so her scenes are especially interesting in this regard. Usually, films seen in the cinema are pretty bombastic and flaunt the sound mixing and effects. Here, although similar care is taken, it is just the exact opposite (weird to be sitting in a theater and hearing...well...nothing!).For all that inventiveness, however, this is a pretty simple film in terms of plot execution and character development. Some might find it a bit predictable for the genre, while that very thing will endear it to those who are coming in solely for the visceral experience. It all just kind of depends on what one is looking for in the experience.As such, this is a film for me that wasn't 'deep' enough to grab a really high ranking, but was easily good enough to be solidly entertaining (I was never close to bored). The 'hook' of the sound-manipulation was the draw for me here, and the plot/characters were just done well enough to prevent me from ever checking out mentally.",7,5,7,6 May 2018
School of Rock," First & Foremost A Jack Black Vehicle, But Still Pretty Entertaining
","It is clear from fairly early on in 'School of Rock' that its primary purpose is to showcase the manic acting talents of Jack Black over everything else. Oftentimes, that can lead to a rather shallow movie (as the plot and auxiliary characters aren't fleshed out as they should be), but in this case the film still ends up being rather entertaining because of the novelty and the music.For a basic plot summary, 'School of Rock' tells the story of Dewey Finn (Black), a middle-aged man who crashes (never paying the rent) at the home of enabling friend Ned (Mike White). You see, Dewey still harbors the rock-and-roll band fantasies of his youth despite the fact that his prospects do not look great. One day, however, Dewey intercepts a substitute teaching call for Ned and assumes his identity, showing up completely unprepared at a fancy prep academy for grade school-ers. The one thing Dewey does know how to do/teach? Rock.Like I said, 'School of Rock' is primarily a vehicle to showcase Black's manic style of performing, and it does that very well. Black never loses energy in a single scene, and his 'Legend of the Rent' performance in front of his pupils (shot all in one take) is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen on film! I feel like watching too much of Black would be exhausting, but contained in this single movie it is a rush of energy.Two other aspects of the film really keep it entertaining: -The basic concept (teaching children how to rock) has never really been done before, at least that I've on. It is entertaining to see the students go from stuck up preppies to confident rockers over the course of the film.-The music, which is always upbeat and fun to listen to. During the times in the film where the plot drags or becomes a bit too corny, there's always that next musical number right around the corner to look forward to.So, I can consider 'School of Rock' very entertaining despite its obvious limitations (being a vehicle film, having a super-cheesy plot, etc.). It won't rocket to the top of any 'best of' lists, but it will create a few iconic music-movie moments. As long as you aren't expecting something deep, you'll have fun watching this!",6,3,4,14 March 2017
The Game," Starts Off Slow, But Suspense/Mystery Builds To Incredible Finale
","The director of 'The Game', David Fincher, is well-known for his groundbreaking films that take viewers on psychological thrill rides. This one falls nicely into that categorization.For a basic plot summary, 'The Game' sees workaholic businessman Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) given a gift certificate to the mysterious 'CRS' company by brother Conrad (Sean Penn). When Nicholas decides to give CRS a try, he is thrust into a far-reaching 'game', of sorts, that touches every aspect of his life.When this movie starts out, it looks like just any other Michael Douglas movie (where he plays the jerk boss). It is a bit slow to get off the ground and will have you wondering which direction the whole experience is taking. About 45 minutes in, though, the film kicks into high gear and only keeps accelerating until the end.This is the type of movie that will have you thinking about its possibilities the whole way through. Just when you think you have it figured it, it throws you another twist again...and again...and again. By the very end, you'll even stop guessing and just resign yourself to the fact that Fincher is going to blow you away no matter what! I hate to call this a 'twist ending' film, but it shares many of those same characteristics.Overall, 'The Game' impressed me with its ability to effectively create high drama, character development, and a sense of mystery throughout. If psychological thrillers are 'your thing', then you can't go wrong here.",8,1,2,9 March 2017
Unknown," Better Movies Exist In Nearly Every Aspect
","Well, Hollywood, you suckered me into another one. After the rousing success of 'Taken', Liam Neeson returns to the same basic format in 'Unknown'. Unfortunately, the final product is far less thrilling and downright bad.For a basic plot summary, 'Unknown' sees bio-scientist Martin Harris (Neeson) in Germany for a worldwide science convention. While oversees, Harris is involved in a traffic accident and gets banged around a bit. When he comes to, his memory is a bit scrambled and his entire identity is seemingly stolen.To put it bluntly, this film is bad in pretty much every aspect, but three really stand out:First off, Hollywood suckers us in by capitalizing on Neeson's 'Taken' persona, only this time throwing in January Jones (of Mad Men fame) as eye candy. No new character ground is trod whatsoever.Second, the plot is almost a carbon-copy of the Jason Bourne series, only much less intriguing and reeking again of capitalizing on an already-done idea.Finally, and this is the truly sad part, this movie actually has a decent mystery revealed towards the end. However, the rest of the movie is so drab that you won't care about the 'big reveal' when it does arrive.Basically, here is how I look at 'Unknown': It tries to channel 'Taken', instead rips off 'Bourne', and ends up far too close to the dismal 'Edge of Darkness'. I'd maybe give it 1.5 stars, but I can't give it the benefit of the doubt for two stars.",2,2,4,11 March 2017
Gran Torino," Finding His Place In Today's World
","I think that anyone who has ever seen a Clint Eastwood film would agree that he is a terrific actor. Whether as a lone cowboy (The Man With No Name Trilogy), a gritty cop (Dirty Harry), or a boxing manager (Million Dollar Baby), Eastwood is able to provide just the right emotions and actions for the part.However, just as important as his acting is the way he progresses his characters in each film he makes. Unlike, say, Sylvester Stallone, who tries to play Rocky Balboa and John Rambo at 60 years old, Eastwood takes on roles suitable for a man his age (78). That is the reason why Gran Torino is such a great film.As the movie begins, Eastwood's character--Walt--is a man who no longer fits into today's world. Being a veteran of the Korean War and a longtime employee at a Ford Motor plant, Walt is a throwback to a different generation. Thus, when a Hmong family moves in next door to him and a gang of young Mexicans begin terrorizing the neighborhood, Walt withdraws even further into the shell of his past (as we all fear what we do not understand). The only time we ever see him happy during the film is while swapping old war stories and tell racist jokes with his old pals down at the local bar. Otherwise, he just bickers with or downright insults everyone else around him, whether it be his Catholic priest, his new neighbors, or even his own family.Due to a completely uncontrollable set of circumstances, however, Walt is drawn into the conflict between the Hmong and Mexican cultures. At first, he resists all attempts to lend a helping hand or accept a little bit of gratitude, but eventually he begins to form some friendships. As the film builds towards and finally reaches its climax, Walt finally begins to understand that the conflicts of today's world are really not that much different those played out on the killing fields of Korea. They may even require the supreme sacrifice in order to make things right.So, while advertised as a story about a Dirty Harry-type character ('Get off my lawn'), this film is really about so much more. In typical Eastwood fashion, not only does he deliver a spot-on acting performance filled with his usual grit balanced by some dry humor, but he also advances the 'aura' of his filmography in a way that no other current Hollywood star can match. Suffice it to say that no chronological context is ever needed for an Eastwood film...he is who he is.Thus, I recommend this film to pretty much everyone (although be warned that the high use of profanity may rule out the tweens). Relative youngsters (those not yet old enough to get the Senior Citizens discount) will likely enjoy the film because they will be able to better understand the actions/attitudes of their own parent/grandparent. Seniors will obviously be intrigued as the story is told from 'their' point of view and Walt struggles with the same emotions they themselves may be grappling with.Of course, also in typical Eastwood fashion, so many other themes are hinted at during the film that one could write a review about completely different subject matter and still be spot-on in their analysis. I can't say for certain that Gran Torino deserved an Oscar nomination in any category (as I haven't seen its competition), but those would have to be some spectacular films to beat this masterpiece.",10,2,5,12 March 2017
The Hurt Locker," Incredible Tension, But Sparse Plot
","As a fan of war-esque cinema, I have seen the greats: Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, First Blood, etc. Recently, however, after watching such films as Jarhead and Brothers, I have begun to notice a phenomena in modern-day war films (primarily about the Middle East, accordingly) in which, while the action may be tremendous, the plot is very sparse and understated. I was hoping for something different in 'Hurt Locker', but was once again disappointed.For a quick plot summary, the events of 'Hurt Locker' take place in Iraq and center on an elite bomb-defusing squad. Time and time again the unit (led by an enigmatic Sergeant played by Jeremy Renner) shows up on the scene of pressure-packed situations and must work fast in order to minimize casualties and general destruction. The effects of that constant tension are also touched on in scenes during the rare 'down time' of the unit.Disregarding the overall message of the film for a moment, the movie created great tension and wartime experiences that I had not yet seen on screen. You will literally feel your pulse rising and may have to remind yourself to breathe as 'Renner's' unit goes about their pressure-cooker situations. This is an aspect of war so crucial to the Middle East conflict that it was about time it got its 'due' on the big screen.Unfortunately, the entire message of the film didn't come anywhere near to living up to that battlefield suspense. Instead of presenting any riveting emotional dilemmas or character studies, director Kathryn Bigelow paints Renner (easily who was supposed to be the emotional background of the film) as such a stark portrait that it was difficult for me to feel anything towards him, whether good or bad. Now, this isn't to say that the film is stark for any sort of lack of effort, as I truly believe that Bigelow believed she was creating high drama with Renner's character. However, in trying to create what she believed to be an accurate portrayal of an Iraq War soldier, she didn't manufacture enough drama to really allow me to identify with the lead character.Thus, your ranking of this film will likely be determined by your feelings about the amount of 'contrived' drama that needs to be concocted in war films. If you like to stick with the very basics, 'The Hurt Locker' will be right up your alley. If however, like me, you need a little external character drama to jump-start your emotions, than you may feel a bit wanting when the end credits roll.",6,1,2,11 March 2017
Meet Joe Black," All That Time And Such A Lackluster Effort
","Very few films are given the opportunity to clock in at a three-hour runtime. When one does, like 'Meet Joe Black', it's a shame that it only uses the gift of time to completely fritter away any semblance of engaging plot or characters.For a basic plot summary, 'Meet Joe Black' tells the story of William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who is visited by the entity of Death taking the body of the recently deceased Joe Black (Brad Pitt). Death makes a deal with Parrish that he'll belay that impending heart attack as long as Bill will allow him to stay in the real world. Bill's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) quickly becomes enchanted by Mr. Black, yet remains at a distance because of the strangeness of the entire ordeal.This is a metaphor film, first and foremost. The metaphor is 'death is literally in the room with you', and how does Bill Parrish react to that. Sadly, though, so much of the film is awkward and stunted because it just doesn't make sense that Joe Black could just show up out of nowhere. That is the huge hole in this story that destabilizes everything around it. I'm always up for a little suspension of disbelief when I go to the movies, but this stretched it a bit too far. For this whole thing to work, there needed to be some explanation for who or what Joe Black was, and the rules were clearly set against that. What if Black would have been a ghost who only appeared to Parrish? Might that have worked better? Something...anything...besides having Black show up out of nowhere and have the issue never get resolved.Secondly, this is very much a character film in the sense that if deep, emotional characters weren't established the whole thing was going to collapse. That is exactly what transpired. Maybe this film was just a 'product of its times' (1998), although I hate using that excuse for any film. Perhaps, though, Hopkins as 'important business man' during the late 90s was more relatable to audiences and Pitt in an exquisite suit wooing a doe-eyed Forlani was just what viewers expected from those characters. Even if it 'played better' during its day, though, it still isn't quality character development by any means.Finally, we get to the film's length. At three hours long, this film had all the time it needed to flesh characters and explore every plot nuance. Instead, it just kind of saunters along until the very end, when some stirring music and fireworks are supposed to provide the emotional context that three hours of runtime could not.Thus, I was extremely disappointed in 'Meet Joe Black' and really found myself a bit angered at how a film given so much 'room to play with' could screw it up so bad. It turns an interesting concept into tedium and turns great actors into bores. Not a great recipe for any film, much less one that plays everything so serious and full of gravitas.",2,2,4,24 February 2017
Ex Machina," A 'Thinking Movie' That Will Also Still Excite
","In the history of the science fiction genre, the concept of artificial intelligence is not a new one. Perhaps popularized (though I'm sure not invented) by Isaac Asimov's works, we have always been fascinated by the idea of our created intelligences turning against us. In many film adaptations of these concepts, however, one or two problems are often in play. Either 1. The movie focuses too much on action instead of concepts (e.g. 'I, Robot'), or 2. There is just too much techno-babble to allow a create story to proceed. Fortunately, director/writer Alex Garland knows exactly what he wants in 'Ex Machina' and is able to create a wonderful story that is one of the best I've seen in quite some time at the cinema.For a basic plot summary, 'Ex Machina' sees young technology whiz Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) win a promotion where he gets to spend a week-long retreat at the glacial home of company owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). When Caleb arrives, he finds that he has really been selected to participate in an experiment (called a Turing Test) in which he must determine the extent to which Nathan's new AI creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander), acts/thinks/feels like a human being. As the sessions with Ava progress, however, Caleb discovers that things may not be exactly what they seem, as he gets conflicting reports/emotions from both Ava & Nathan about the nature of what is really happening.During the early stages of 'Ex Machina', Nathan makes a comment to Caleb about how he 'doesn't want a lecture...just honest feelings'. Viewers come to understand at the end of the experience, however, that this quote also represents the vision behind the film. Much like, say, 'Back To The Future' is able to deal with time-travel in a way that isn't overly complicated, this film's caretakers do all they can to not turn the potential heavy subject matter into a complicated thesis or a philosophy class. That isn't to say, of course, that the film is shallow in any way. In fact, it is the exact opposite. By keeping the tech-speak to a minimum, the producers are able to build up some great characters and tense situations that feel very genuine.I really would like to say more about this movie, but to do so would venture too far into spoiler territory. This is the kind of film that will take viewers on many twist/turns before all is said and done, and those 'aha!' moments are what really top off the experience (combined with the intellectually stimulating plots/characters).Overall, it had been awhile since I had sat in a theater and watched such an intellectually challenging film, but also been able to 'sit back and enjoy the ride' at the same time. For anyone who loves a great 'thinking movie' but doesn't like it when those types of movies turn into tangled messes or artsy symbolism, 'Ex Machina' will rocket up near the top of your favorite films list.",10,1,3,28 February 2017
Back to the Future Part III," A Bit Flat, But Still A Good Ending To A Masterpiece Trilogy
","The first two films in the 'Back To The Future' trilogy explore the concept of time like never before. Viewers are taken to two different versions of 1985, twice propelled back to 1955, and even catapulted into 2015 for a short time. The character continuity is incredible, the acting is inspired, and so many different genres are incorporated that the films are nearly rendered perfectly genre-less. Obviously, it would be tough to beat the energy of those two incredible films, and (while this film gives a valiant effort) it just doesn't quite make it.Basically, the plot of BTTF 3 is set in the Old West (1885, to be exact), where Doc Brown was transported to at the end of the second film. Ignoring the Doc's instructions, young Marty McFly instead repairs the time machine and goes back to bring Doc back home. The three obstacles in his way: Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (the most hated gunslinger in the West), Clara (Doc's new love), and an empty tank of gas in the DeLorean.Though this movie won't leave you feeling utterly disappointed or anything like that, as it has its moments of greatness, it just falls a bit short of the magic created by the first two efforts. Perhaps the biggest culprit is the flatness of the jokes that were funny in parts one and two, like the 'wake up' scene and the Tannen family 'manure curse', but became somewhat stale the third time around.Another shortcoming, oddly enough, was the fact that the film has more to do with character- development than its two previous successors. The Marty-Doc friendship is on center stage, while Doc's new-found infatuation with Clara is a major part of the storyline. While usually that kind of character-building is essentially in films, it is kind of wasted in this case, as fans knew the end of the trilogy was at hand and thus the relationships would go no further.However, though I have touched on a few of the reasons why this film doesn't match the sheer brilliance of the first two, please do not hesitate to watch it and complete the most inventive film trilogy in history. It is not a dud by any means, and certain viewers may even find it more enjoyable than 'Part Two', as it isn't as complicated and the jokes are a bit more obvious.",8,1,1,12 March 2017
The Illusionist," A 'Big Reveal' Film From A Director Who Doesn't Get It Right
","When making a 'big reveal' film, a top-notch director must realize that the 'reveal' cannot be the entire picture. One must also include fair doses of character development, believable actions, & compelling drama in order to make us care enough for the reveal to actually mean something. Sadly, Neil Burger does very little of that within 'The Illusionist'.For a basic plot summary, this period piece centers on stage magician Eisenheim (Edward Norton), who conjures up apparitions that are utterly stupefying. When Sophie (Jessica Biel), the former love of his life, comes back into the equation, Eisenheim must make the decision once and for all as to whether or not they can carve out a life together despite being from completely different social classes.Despite the fact that 'The Illusionist' was clearly made with care and a very good intent, it ultimately fails to impress for two specific reasons:1. There really isn't much to get invested in. The characters are little more than cardboard cutouts (the human element is only 'talked', not actually 'lived'), while the events transpiring around them are never explained (e.g. Eisenheim's actual tricks).2. There is no 'grit' to the picture whatsoever. In Christopher Nolan's masterpiece 'The Prestige', a similar magic-themed film, the director takes you deep inside the world the characters are living in, pulling no punches along the way. We see it all...the good and the bad and all the raw emotions that result from it. In 'The Illusionist', however, stereotypical 'class differences' and 'the controlling husband' are used in place of real emotion. Those stereotypes may have been true of the era, but in this case they needed to be felt instead of just referenced.Overall, then, I cannot recommend this one to those who like their movies deep and full of character growth, as it is quite superficial all the way around. Yes, it does have a 'mind-blowing' reveal, but because it fails in so many areas before that point, it loses all its credibility, so to speak. I highly recommend 'The Prestige' as an alternative yet still containing very similar themes.",3,3,4,7 March 2017
Grudge Match," 'Rocky vs. Raging Bull' Can't Carry An Entire Film
","When I first heard of the concept for this film, I thought that the whole 'Rocky vs. Raging Bull' angle was interesting. When I saw the trailer for it, I thought that it looked like a comedy with a healthy dose of heart. When I saw the movie itself...I realized it was an 'idea' picture surrounded by filler.For a basic plot summary, 'Grudge Match' tells the two of two rival boxers who each beat the other one time, setting up what was to be a hugely popular 'rubber match'. Before the fight could take place, however, Henry 'Razor' Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) walked away from the sport, leaving Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen (Robert De Niro) to stew over what could have been. Thirty years later, both fighters meet up again at a motion-capture exercise for a new video game coming out. They still have as much vitriol and hatred for each other as before, and thus the rivalry is rekindled. When the prospect of a huge $$$ purse is dangled before their eyes, they agree to step in the ring one final time to settle the score once and for all.The trouble with this movie is two-fold:First, Stallone has never achieved any comedic success (besides perhaps 'Avenging Angelo', but that wasn't supposed to even BE a comedy)...period! When it comes to the comedy of this film, De Niro runs circles around Stallone. Since they both share about equal screen time, the Sly comedy scenes get a bit tough to stomach. Plus, as usual, Kevin Hart's brand of comedy is very much an acquired taste (one that this reviewer hasn't come around to).Secondly, even the best of comedy movies have to contain some heart or 'meat' behind them, and 'Grudge Match' fails miserably in that department. The backstory involving Kim Basinger's character just isn't interesting enough to make you care about what should be the emotional punch of the movie.Granted, there are some positives to this film (hence the 2 stars instead of just a single). Some jokes (especially for those intimately familiar with Stallone and De Niro's past works) are laugh- out-loud funny, while the end fight scene is probably the best part of the entire movie (where Stallone really gets to shine).However, it is quite clear that the 'Rocky vs Raging Bull' concept is what fueled this movie, and that just wasn't enough to carry a two-hour film. 'Grudge Match' isn't terrible, but I have absolutely no desire to watch it again, either.",3,2,3,4 March 2017
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," An Eccentric, Original Tale
","Basically, this movie is about a baby (Benjamin) who is born old and ages in reverse over the course of the film. Along the way, because of his strange life cycle, Benjamin is able to view humanity through an entirely different spectrum and have relationships that 'normal' people are not given the chance to entertain (don't you wish sometimes that you would have had the mind of an adult in the body of a child?!). This journey raises some interesting observations on humanity and relationships that will leave the viewer pondering the definition of 'aging' and the inevitable consequences of Benjamin's seemingly charmed existence (is it better aging in his fashion, or will the same problems abound as for the rest of us?).Upon the conclusion of this film, I found myself intrigued at all the subtle themes that the movie had brought up. Although I won't give this film a full five stars due to its inability to intertwine all the loose plot and theme threads (think 'Dark Knight' or 'Gran Torino'), I do still consider it a solid effort that will have you pondering its message long after you turn off the TV.",7,1,2,12 March 2017
Transformers," Escapism Film-Making At Its Finest
","Sometimes (probably more often than not in this day and age), movies are not meant to be intensely analyzed and picked apart. If one were to do that to 'Transformers', the review would likely come back a negative one. However, this flick requires its viewers to be one simple thing: sit back and enjoy the ride! If that can be done, 'Transformers' will thoroughly entertain you.For a basic plot summary, 'Transformers' focuses on high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). While leading a relatively normal teenage life and trying to get the 'hot girl' of his dreams Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox), Sam is swept into an invasion of Earth by the evil Decepticons transformer robots. Allying with the U.S. government and the benevolent Autobots, Sam becomes central to the action due to his family lineage.If one could ever classify a film as 'whiz-bang', this one be the textbook definition of that statement. It has everything most cinema fans want: pulse-pounding action, cool gadgets, romance, and a script that never takes a down moment...the action is always moving forward.What makes 'Transformers' a truly quality experience, however, is the fact that the plot and characters contain a great deal of heart. The plot isn't Shakespeare, of course, but who can't relate to 'good vs. evil'? LaBeouf is absolutely perfect as Witwicky, while Fox turned herself into a national sex symbol simply by playing 'that hot girl from high school that all the boys lusted over' & leaning over the engine of a car (!). Again, a set of characters that most individuals can relate to.Overall, 'Transformers' will sweep you away if you can let it. Instead of nit-picking or analyzing 'the small stuff', this is one to 'get your popcorn ready' for!",9,4,5,7 March 2017
Pawn Sacrifice," Great Acting & High Drama In A Wonderful Period Piece
","Despite the fact that I can't play chess worth a lick (and haven't really even given it all that much of an effort), I've always found the game to be fascinating as the ultimate test of mental acuity. It has been said that just four moves into a match, there are 288 billion permutations thereafter. Wow! 'Pawn Sacrifice' is the story of perhaps the greatest chess player of all time, Bobby Fischer, and his tumultuous battle both with the Soviet Union's best chess players and his own inner demons.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins with Fischer (Tobey Maguire) not showing up to his promoted matched with Russian Grand Master Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber). It is clear that Fischer is not well. The film then flashes back to scenes from earlier in Bobby's life, where he is managed by Paul Marshall (Michael Stuhlbarg) and mentored by Father Bill Lombardy (Peter Sarsgaard). Despite being a chess genius, without a doubt, there is always the chance that Bobby will dive off the deep end at any second. As his stature grows, he catches the eye of the Soviet Union (locked in the heart of the Cold War with America), who will stop at nothing to make sure their champion, Spassky, is seen as superior. This sets up the epic clash between Spassky and Fischer, where a good deal more than chess is on the line.'Pawn Sacrifice' is a great film primarily because of the superb acting performances all around. This is the type of movie that needs simmering drama and sustained emotion to succeed (can't rely on special effects or action/adventure), and all those things are provided. Particularly noteworthy is Maguire as Fischer. It's the type of performance that, had the film succeeded a bit more financial, could have garnered him some awards. All the auxiliary cast are spot-on as well.It's also quite a feat to take a movie that primarily consists of two people staring at a board contemplating seem drama-filled. Obviously, the backstory of everything else going on is what creates the majority of the drama, but even the chess scenes themselves are fraught with tension and suspense. For those who think chess is 'boring', they might have a different view after watching 'Pawn Sacrifice'.Probably the only thing keeping the picture from being truly great is that a bit more development could have been given to the Spassky character. The story of Fischer is intriguing, to be sure, but for every 'hero' there must be equal shrift given to the 'villain', and sometimes that fails to happen here. The scenes where Spassky is given some development are great and Schreiber shines, but they just seem a bit few and far between.All told, 'Pawn Sacrifice' is a great movie for those who like historical biopics or are interested in Bobby Fischer's story or chess in general. The acting performances carry the way, and there is a sense of tension right up to and even through the final credits. You'll never believe that chess can be this exciting!",9,1,1,25 February 2017
Men in Black II," Will Smith's Humor Carries This Sequel To Greatness
","In terms of plot, 'Men in Black II' is vastly inferior to the original, as it is pretty much just the same song-and-dance, but this time without the 'wow' factor of things being so new and inventive. However, director Barry Sonnenfield realizes this time around that the humor of Will Smith (and especially his interactions with Tommy Lee Jones) need to carry the show.For a basic plot summary, 'MIB II' sees Agent J (Smith) now the lead agent of MIB. However, when an evil alien named Serleena (Lara Flynn Boyle) takes over MIB headquarters, J must retrieve the only agent who might know how to resolve the situation: Agent K (Jones).Though the first 'MIB' effort was a 5-star flick because of its inventiveness, this one is a similar success because of the humor from beginning to end. When thinking back on the entire 'MIB Trilogy', some scenes in this movie rank up there with the best of the whole series, such as J's interactions with 'Frank the Pug', and the scenes in which J must re-acclimate K to the MIB life. Oh, and let's not forget the Worms, either ('Twister!').The filmmakers even manage to weave a bit of a human-interest story into this one, and the actors are all good enough to make it interesting and believable.Overall, then, while containing a much weaker villain and a meandering plot, 'MIB II' is still a classic effort due to its sight gags and hilarious interactions between the two leads. Unless you take this franchise a little too seriously, you'll still enjoy this one as much as the first!",8,1,3,8 March 2017
1917," A Technical Masterpiece, But A Bit Short In The Plot Department
","From the very first frame of '1917', it is abundantly clear that the film is going to hang its hat on cinematography and technical prowess. Truth be told, that aspect is indeed so good that I'd never consider dropping it below the seven stars I gave it. That being said, I really can't vault it into the stratosphere of my celluloid favorites either, due to it being relatively short in the plot department.For a very basic overview, '1917' tells the story of two British WWI soldiers who are tasked with relaying a very important message to an adjacent line: the Germans are not retreating, but instead regrouping for a trap. So, Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) set off across the dangerous French countryside to relay the message. Along the way, they encounter numerous obstacles and meet a string of individuals both friend and foe. Adding further emotional stakes to the proceedings is the fact that Blake's brother is one of the soldiers about to be sent over the trench and into the trap.There is absolutely no doubt that the visuals here are splendid. Noted cinematographer Roger Deakins truly does work his magic. Whether running through the trenches, navigating the muddy quagmires of no-man's land, or simply traversing the countryside, this truly is a sight to behold. Of course, the thing everyone is talking about is how the film looks like one long take (not true, of course, but expertly camouflaged). While I found that to be technically more of a 'gimmick' than anything, it does structurally provide the forward momentum that a film like '1917' needs.Which, actually, brings me to why this movie will never be one of my favorites. Perhaps this is as much personal preference as anything, but I just need more plot 'meat' to sink my teeth into. Because the characters are always rushing forward on some urgent task or plight, there are precious few times to stop and really be at all introspective about what is happening. This isn't so much noticed 'in the moment' when the action is hot-and-heavy, but upon conclusion my thoughts rolled more towards 'what am I actually taking away from this experience?', with (unfortunately) the answer being 'not all that much' in terms of overall plot/themes.So, the way I see '1917' is that if it doesn't win all or most of the technical or cinematography awards at the Oscars, it will be a shame. But is it in the territory of Best Picture? I would argue no...there just isn't enough substance to take that leap.",7,3,5,27 January 2020
Lincoln," Spielberg Proves That Contemplative Film Still Has Place In Cinema
","Before heading to the theater to see 'Lincoln', I had read a number of reviews stating how it was 'long-winded' and 'just a lot of talking'. Because of Steven Spielberg's track record, though, I had a pretty good inkling that it would be a solid effort. Even against those expectations, though, I was blown away by Mr. Spielberg's ability to make a contemplative film as intriguing and engrossing as any of his other action/adventure fare.For a basic plot summary, 'Lincoln' focuses on President Lincoln's (Daniel Day-Lewis) dogged persistence to pass the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery towards the end of the Civil War. Other major players in the narrative include wife Mary Todd (Sally Field), William Seward (David Strathairn), Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), & Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones).The most amazing trait of 'Lincoln' is its ability to, despite being more 'talk than action', so to speak, craft a compelling, inspiring tale filled with emotions about politics that still ring true today. The events may be sent 150 years ago, but the material still feels fresh and never boring. Also helping matters is that film only builds upon itself as it plays out, resulting in the most breathtaking material commencing towards the last 30-40 minutes of the picture when all the characters/events have been set up for some impressive climaxes. Basically, it's just Spielberg doing his directorial thing (!).Also helping matters is the wonderful acting throughout. The auxiliary cast are all well-placed, but it is (of course) the performance of President Lincoln that makes or breaks this flick. Luckily, Day-Lewis should win an Oscar for this turn, as he so expertly captures the nuances of the script and it s sometimes comedic, sometimes somber, sometimes inspirational passages.The simple musical score from John Williams is, again, pretty much par for the course (i.e. brilliant!). It is a powerful score, but one that does not detract from the words/actions on screen.Overall, I consider 'Lincoln' to be a marvelous film that does so many things well. Primarily, though, it really makes you think about such tough issues as back-room politics, the emotions surrounding the Civil War, and the weight of the decisions made by our country's leaders. Please, please, PLEASE do not be put off by a few so-so reviews or the long (2:30) runtime. This is a true classic that should be required viewing for every American citizen.",10,3,4,8 March 2017
Million Dollar Baby," As Close To A Perfect Movie As One May Get
","I've probably seen 'Million Dollar Baby' a solid 4-5 times now in my lifetime thus far. Despite that intimate knowledge of plot, characters, and even dialogue, the experience never fails to enthrall me on an emotional level. I truly consider this to be one of the best films ever created.For a very basic overview, 'Million Dollar Baby' tells the story of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), an incredibly dedicated yet utterly raw boxer desperate for a trainer to give her an opportunity. She turns to Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a grizzled old gym owner who is initially reluctant to 'train a girl' until recognizing her work ethic and drive. While both fighter and trainer initially fill gaps in each other's lives, their partnership is eventually tested to the max in the face of incredible tragedy.
There are so many areas that combine together to make 'Million Dollar Baby' a near-perfect film:The plot is great not only for fans of pugilism, but also for anyone that loves a Rocky-like underdog story. The character of Maggie is so expertly constructed and easy to root for that it makes the ending of her arc that much more of a gut punch. The way she softens Frankie's outlook on life will also pull on your heartstrings.The inclusion of Morgan Freeman as essentially the narrator of the movie is a brilliant move. Not only does his voice provide the perfect backdrop for all the emotional cues, but his character ('Scrap') serves a key role in bridging the gap between Maggie and Frankie.The music is almost an entity in and of itself in this film, providing a very distinct experience. From Eastwood's own simply piano melodies to the sweeping orchestra that takes over in the emotional throes, this is a soundtrack that will stick with you.Of course, the gut-punch last 20-30 minutes absolutely comes out of nowhere and changes the entire tenor of the piece. What had been a fairly traditional (if still eminently enjoyable) underdog sports movie turns on a dime to examine issues like euthanasia and personal redemption. This is where the acting really shines. A particular scene where Eastwood's Frankie is asked-by Maggie-for an almost unthinkable request is one of the best reaction shots I've ever seen put to film. Really, the entire cast here give nuanced, spot-on performances.I really struggle to find criticisms of 'Million Dollar Baby' whatsoever. There is not a single wasted line of dialogue or scene to be found. Everything is 'paid off' at some point, which is the sign of a fantastic screenplay.Overall, this is a film that rests squarely within my 'top five movies of all-time' list. I'll never forget how it seemingly came out of nowhere in late 2004 to ultimately take home 4 Oscars and be nominated for three more. The emotional rollercoaster this film takes you on is absolutely second to none.",10,1,1,11 February 2020
Dumb and Dumber," When Jim Carrey Was The King Of Comedy
","To be honest, I don't exactly know how to review a film like 'Dumb and Dumber', but suffice it to say that the entire film rests on the shoulders of one man: Jim Carrey.Though so many crazy things happen over the course of this movie, the basic plot has two friends, Harry (Jeff Daniels) and Lloyd (Carrey), driving across the country to return a 'lost' briefcase to a woman they met at an airport. While on first viewing you will appreciate the wild and wacky antics that Harry and Lloyd get themselves into (and everyone has their favorites, such as the bathroom scene, Seabass, or Big Gulps), upon multiple viewings you will realize that the true genius of the film is in the subtleties of Jim Carrey's magnificent acting.Though Daniels provides a great 'straight man' that the film sorely needed, Carrey really steals the show with his physical comedy and facial expressions. In nearly EVERY SCENE, one could laugh themselves silly just watching the facial expressions (the whiz in the bottle scene) and body motions ('I'll hang by the bar...and put out the vibe!') of Carrey. Basically, Carrey took the intense, prat-falling stage show he was know for around the comedy circuits, toned it down a bit, and created the most hilarious character ever depicted on film.Of course, what really makes 'Dumb and Dumber' stand the test of time is the 'watchability' factor. There are few movies that will make me drop pretty much anything I am doing and watch them, but this film is EXACTLY that. It could be on every night of the week (and darn near sometimes is on TBS!) and I would still laugh just as hard at the same old jokes and scenarios!Suffice it to say that after viewing this hilarious film, you 'will like it ahh-lott'. If not, you're pretty much just 'one pathetic loser...no offense'.",10,5,8,12 March 2017
Jurassic World," Definitive Proof That This Is A One-Story Franchise
","'Jurassic World' was guaranteed to turn a large profit no matter if it was 'good' or 'bad'. The franchise is quite popular and it just has that 'summer blockbuster' feel to it. Sadly, I wish that the film's creators would have attempted to make the plot of the film even decent, or create characters that aren't wooden caricatures.For a basic plot summary, 'Jurassic World' sees the vision of Mr. Hammond finally complete...a fully-functional dinosaur amusement park. Of course, in today's 'bigger and better' society, it isn't good enough just to reproduce classic dinosaurs. Now, new dinos (one bigger than T-Rex and another that can swallow a shark in a single gulp, among others) are being genetically spliced and created in a lab. The park is run by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), a profit-driven corporate executive type who doesn't even have time for her two nephews (played by Nick Robinson & Ty Simpkins) when they visit the park. Dinosaur caretaker Owen (Chris Pratt), on the other hand, is fully aware of what these dangerous animals can do if not reckoned with. A military sub-plot simmers in the background of the story. The new 'big boy' dinosaur gets loose, and from there it is what one would expect from this type of film.This movie features an ethical debate about genetic manipulation, two annoying kids who are the definition of stupidity, a lot of rampaging dinosaurs, and and vision to build the most ill-advised theme park in human history. If this sounds at all familiar to you, it is probably because you've seen the original 'Jurassic Park'. I honestly don't know if I've ever seen a sequel (which does not market itself as a remake) that is so unabashedly similar to its predecessor(s).I think the problem with this franchise is simple: It had one great story to tell, and Steven Spielberg did just that in 'Jurassic Park'. All the sequels have failed to capture nearly a glimmer of that magic, because the novelty has worn off and there aren't good stories to tell. At least 'Lost World' & 'III' try to bring something original to the screen. 'World' doesn't even go that far, instead settling for a few new dinosaurs and riding on the name of the franchise. The plots are incredible dumb/predictable and the characters are more of the same.The only reason I won't give this movie a 'bottom of the barrel' 1-star review is because there are a few exciting scenes (the opening 20-30 minutes shows promise before quickly descending into predictability and repetition) and it is a 'slick' experience from beginning to end. Even though you know that what you are watching isn't great, there is so much going on and so much action that you can never just mentally 'check out'. In that sense, this really is the textbook 'brainless summer blockbuster'.Even though I came into this viewing experience with mediocre expectations, I was disappointed that 'Jurassic World' didn't even live up to that standard. If you've been hiding under a rock since 1993 and haven't seen any of the other 'Jurassic' films, you will love this one! For those who like a little bit of plot and a few interesting characters with their whiz-bang dinosaur action, however, it will be clear to you that this franchise can no longer deliver either of those two things.",3,14,17,27 February 2017
Paranormal Activity," Slides By On Interesting Concept
","After being told that 'Paranormal Activity' was the 'next big thing' in horror movies (in line with The Ring and Saw), I wanted to experience the phenomena first-hand. Unfortunately, despite the film's knack for making you continue to watch just to 'see what happens', it left me disappointed in the end.For a basic plot summary, the film focuses on a young married couple who begin experiencing some strange phenomena once their heads hit the pillow at night. It starts with little things, like creaky noises and bumps in the night, but eventually escalates into footsteps, moving sheets, and slamming doors...too obvious to be anything 'naturally occurring'. The young couple then must decide what to do next...run away, or stay and fight this invisible force.The interesting angle of this movie is that it is shot in a format not seen since The Blair Witch Project...handy-cam (for lack of a better word). However, the manic flailings of 'Blair Witch' are tamed down this time into a simple camera on a tripod recording all the action. Whereas most traditional horror movies try to scare you with disfigured antagonists or bursts of well-timed creepy music, this effort just lets the 'camera do the talking'. It is a very unique way of creating suspense, and thus at least held my interest until the very end.The big problem, though, is two-fold: repetition and incredible annoying characters. Every night, the same thing happens: a noise startles the man, who curses a few times, which wakes up his wife, who pleads with him not to go downstairs (which he always does anyway). That same sequence happens literally every night until the very end of the film. It doesn't help that both characters (played by Katie Featherston & Micah Sloat) do nothing but annoy each other (and thus the audience) for the duration. Micah treats the whole ordeal as a joke, even when the visual evidence is too much to deny, while Katie is reduced to little more than a scream-machine (albeit a very attractive one).Thus, although Paranormal Activity is indeed a novel way to create a horror film, I can't wholly recommend it due to the shallow characters and repetitive plot. Up until the final couple of minutes, the plot is so tired and slow as to almost be boring at times. Let's just say that when PA 2 premieres this October, I won't be in the theater.",5,1,1,10 March 2017
The Adjustment Bureau," Doesn't Stand Out In Any Way
","If you don't watch a lot of movies, 'The Adjustment Bureau' will be an entertaining ride. If, like me, you've 'seen 'em all', this one does not stand out in any way, shape, or form.For a basic plot summary, 'Adjustment Bureau' tells the story of David Norris (Matt Damon) and Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt), two lovers seemingly destined to be together. However, a mysterious group of derby-wearing men in suits (known only as the Adjustment Bureau) do all they can to prevent the coupling in order for the world to stay on 'the plan'.The main problem with this movie is that it tries to be so many different things and doesn't succeed at any of them. It's a romance, but without romantic tension. It's an action flick, but with no effects or chase scenes that stand out. It's a philosophical piece, but with little time to really dig in. It's a paranormal romp, but without any explanation in the end. Basically, it's one of those movies where the lead characters run around a lot, emote a tad, and end up with a very contrived, unappealing climax for the effort.Thus, while 'The Adjustment Bureau' doesn't outrightly fail at anything (hence the two star rating as opposed to one), it doesn't really succeed at much, either. Unless you don't get out much, skip this effort and find something that really works.",4,2,5,11 March 2017
Black Hawk Down," Very Intense, But Not Altogether Engaging
","While watching 'Black Hawk Down', I began comparing it to other war movies/series I have previously watched, such as 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Band of Brothers', and 'Flags of Our Fathers'. Though the film impressed me with its gritty realism and intensity, there was just something missing that never really [...] me into the plot...a lack of the overly dramatic.Basically, the movie takes place during the United States Army's attempt to liberate the country of Somolia from dictator Mohamed Farrah Aidid. When the mission begins to stray from its objectives and a Black Hawk military chopper crashes en route, a group of soldiers on the ground are put in extreme harms way in order to rescue their fellow brothers and fully complete the mission objectives.The film succeeds in its ability to portray the type of warfare not uncommon to the Middle Eastern region. Instead of the beach assaults or air raids common of World War II fighting, the 'modern' warfare method (at least in the Middle East) includes much more house-to-house, intense personal combat. The intensity of that fighting is aptly portrayed by director Ridley Scott and shows that all fighting in war is brutal...no matter where it takes place.Yet, despite that realistic take on war violence, I actually thought that the movie suffered a bit from the fact that it didn't really try to embellish the story at all with any added drama. Usually this objective approach in a film would be a good thing, but in the case of 'Black Hawk' it only adds to make things a bit long and tedious. Scott sticks to the basic details of the military assault, and really never delves into the personal lives of any of the characters or adds any auxiliary drama.Thus, although 'Black Hawk Down' is a very gritty, realistic portrayal of modern-day war efforts, to me at least it fell a bit flat dramatically. A little bit of character development or 24-esque drama would have gone a long way towards making it a memorable film experience.",5,1,2,11 March 2017
Rudy," The Indomitable Power Of The Human Spirit
","'Rudy' was released to theaters in 1993. By today's Hollywood standards, that is getting on in age. For a film like this, however, time is (and will continue to be) almost a non-factor, as a movie so based in human themes and emotions will never cease to be relevant.For a basic plot summary, 'Rudy' is based on the real-life story of Rudy Ruettiger (Sean Astin), whose entire goal in life from childhood onward was to enroll at Notre Dame and play football for the Irish. The problem? His grades aren't up to snuff coming out of high school, his short stature makes football seem like a pipe dream, and father Daniel (Ned Beatty) doesn't encourage his dreams. Through hard work and extreme determination, however, Rudy manages to put himself in position for those dreams to come true. Will he be able to take that final step and run out of the tunnel in pads? That's what the film ultimately builds up to.Much like, say, 'Hoosiers' or 'Dead Poets Society', 'Rudy' is a film that almost gets an 'average' knock now because it practically invented a genre that is now basically the standard for inspirational sports films. There was no 'teacher standing on the desk' cliche before Robin Williams, no 'measuring the basket' scene until Hackman, and no 'power of sheer motivation' emotional tear-jerkers before 'Rudy'. So, while watching this film now it may seem like you've seen this type before, just remember that is only because 'Rudy' started the trend!As a football fan myself, it is tough to believe I hadn't seen this one all the way through until my 32nd year on this planet. To me, Astin was always 'Samwise the Hobbit' from Lord of the Rings! Like I said previously, I think I was a bit scared away by the 'done to death' cliches that it seems to represent. I'm glad I finally 'caved', however, as this is a truly special and emotional film.Overall, 'Rudy' is one of the greats in both its own genre (sports) as well as of all-time. Even those who have no idea what football is all about can appreciate Rudy's inspirational story.",8,1,2,22 September 2018
Prisoners," A Simple Premise, Yet Oh So Complex Emotionally
","After viewing 'Prisoners' opening night in the theater with a couple of friends, I turned to them during the closing credits and said 'I feel like I've just been through a ten round prize fight'. It had been a long time since I'd seen a movie that battered my emotions quite as much as this one.For a basic plot summary, 'Prisoners' opens on a typical Thanksgiving day in what just might be your (the viewers') neighborhood. Instead of the normal revelry and family cheer, however, the daughters of Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) are kidnapped. When detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds a very strange suspect (Paul Dano), it jump-starts the case in a terrifying direction that goes further into the realm of gritty reality than most films will show.I consider 'Prisoners' to be one of the best films I've ever seen (I don't even want to put a genre to it, as that would be such a disservice to its breadth) because it is so perfect on both the plot and character levels.Plot-wise, it is a simple kidnapping story (one that has been utilized numerous times in cinema), yet director Dennis Villeneuve pushes its boundaries to the very max. Just when you think you have the film pinned down, it manages to surprise you and go in another direction. Yet, everything makes logical sense and feels 'real' at the same time.That being said, the kidnapping plot itself (while brilliant) is not even the primary focus of the film. Instead, it is the characters reactions to the events, making viewers ponder how we would react in similar situations. The main focus here is on Dover and Loki, but each character adds a very specifically nuanced emotion to the overall mix. The result is drama the likes of which is rarely seen (and sustained for nearly two and a half hours) on the big screen.I rarely watch a movie twice within the span of a year, but when 'Prisoners' comes out to home video I will be snapping it up in an instant to watch with others who I know will appreciate the eerie genius of the experience. I know that many, many more movies will be released between now and 'awards season' (aka Academy Awards), but it would be a crying shame if this masterpiece isn't highly represented. For the rest of the year, I'll be hard-pressed to see one better.",10,1,2,5 March 2017
For Love of the Game," Kevin Costner Just 'Gets' Baseball
","Considering the fact that 'Field of Dreams' (also starring Kevin Costner and about the national pastime) is my favorite sports film of all time, I watched this film with high expectations. For the most part, this movie lived up to those expectations.Basically, the plot centers on Detroit Tigers pitcher Billy Chapel, who finds himself nearing the end of a very long and very successful career. However, when the owner of the Tigers tells Billy that the team no longer can afford him, Billy must make the biggest decision of his life (be traded or retire), all the while putting up zeroes on the Yankee Stadium scoreboard on the final day of the baseball season.This aspect of the film (Billy's tumultuous decision) really works for baseball fans in a couple of ways. First is the use of flashbacks (think LOST) that show Billy's career up until the present, including his long road back from injury and a burgeoning (yet complicated) romance. Secondly, the vocal talents of Vin Scully (the real-life voice of the Dodgers) will remind all viewers that this movie truly is meant to appeal to pure baseball fans. As Billy pitches deep into his remarkable game, all the while recollecting the earlier events of his life, the film's climax is superbly narrated by Scully.About the only 'knock' I have on this film (and thus why it isn't five stars) stems from the fact that Billy's romantic issues tend to be a bit too contrived to create the highest form of believable drama. Perhaps Costner was trying to portray a very conflicted Chapel, but to me it came off as a bit confusing how Billy could have his 'affairs on the side' and still be involved in a touching romance.All told, though, this is a film that baseball fans will almost certainly love. Even if you don't completely fall for the romantic aspects, you will be cheering on Billy Chapel as he struggles to achieve the pinnacle of baseball greatness for a pitcher. Once again, as in 'Field of Dreams', Costner proves that he truly does know how to capture the essence of what makes the game of baseball so dramatic.",7,1,2,12 March 2017
Big Fish," A Man, His Son, And The Stories Between Them
","In my lifetime, I have come across very few movies ('It's A Wonderful Life', 'The Champ') that will make grown men care enough about the stories/characters to weep. 'Big Fish' is one of those select films.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of a dying old man (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup). For his entire life, the son has been overshadowed by the tall tales of his father, and is resentful of that fact. In the final days of the old man's life, however, his stories featuring the younger version of himself (Ewan McGregor) prove to indeed be the most important link between father and son.Since this is a Tim Burton-directed movie, trying to explain it in words is like trying to describe a work of art hanging in a museum. You know it is great, but you just can't quite put a solid explanation pulling together all the reasons why. Suffice it to say, however, it is one of the rare Burton efforts that is rife with his flare for the cinematography craziness but yet manages to not get lost in the imagery and still make sense in the end.'Big Fish' is also one of the most emotional movies one could ever watch. It will particular touch fathers and sons (as that is the backbone of the story), but there is something for everyone to enjoy. Actors such as Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, Alison Lohman, Marion Cotillard, and Steve Buscemi play key roles that enhance the emotion all that much more.Overall, 'Big Fish' is a movie that must be seen in order to fully be understood. Look at all the five-star reviews here on Amazon and know that it isn't because of a 'fad' or a bunch of fanboys. This is just a solid movie featuring top-notch storytelling, emotion, characters, cinematography, and even humor.",10,3,4,5 March 2017
The Insider," Nothing Black and White About This Film
","If there's one thing I hate about certain movies, it is that they are too 'black and white'. I'm not talking pigmentation, though, but rather the depth of the plot and characters. Life is too complicated and filled with shades of gray to be simplified at the theater, and I'm glad 'The Insider' doesn't pander in that fashion.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former 'Big Tobacco' scientist who must decide whether to keep the trade secrets, or blow the whistle on the most powerful business entity in the U.S. On the story is journalist Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who (against his ethical code) becomes personally involved with Wigand and as such gets drawn even deeper into the business intrigue.There is nothing simple about this film: Should Wigand do the interview and put his family in danger all in the name of 'ethics'? Should Bergman take the case to another level at the expense of HIS future? Nearly ever situation in the movie will make you contemplate what is 'right' or 'wrong'.What really makes this solid film into a 5-star experience, though, is the acting of Pacino. I never really got into Pacino's earlier mob flicks, but his later-years work (like here) really impresses me. Does he play essentially the same character all the time? Absolutely. But it doesn't matter in the slightest because he is so incredible at it. The most natural 'intense guy' actor I've ever seen.Thus, 'The Insider' is a great movie that will draw you in with the engaging plot, incredible acting, and the real-life setting based on a true story. I can't vouch for the film's historical accuracy, but as a stand-alone film it deserves all the Oscar nominations it garnered.",9,2,2,11 March 2017
Major League," Tries To Be A Bit Too Much, But Still A Solid Effort
","As a passionate fan of the game of baseball and thus, by extension, films about the national pastime, I have come to the conclusion that there really are just two camps that baseball movies fall into:First, there is the Kevin Costner style of doing baseball (Field of Dreams, For The Love Of The Game, etc.) that romanticize (almost to a religious level) the game and relate it to real life on a very personal level.Then, there are films like Little Big League, which don't take themselves seriously at all, yet that is the whole point...as neither do many big league ballplayers! These types of films, while short on plot and substance, are incredibly funny and speak to the type of humor that is needed to emotionally survive such a long 'work week' (162-game season).The film 'Major League' is obviously a comedy, as its cast of characters is as goofy as goofy can get. There's the crazy psychopath (played by Charlie Sheen), the high-ego strutter (Wesley Snipes), the crazy voodoo guy (Dennis Haysbert), the serious, play-to-win guy (Tom Berenger), and even the gruff manager who's seen it all and his face never cracks (James Gammon). Plus, even the eccentric announcer ('Juuuuuuuuuuust a bit outside'-Bob Uecker) is thrown into the mix. When that nutty lot is thrown together on the field because the owner of the Cleveland Indians wants attendance to drop so bad that she can move the team out of town, hilarity ensues!Yet, I actually think that what held this movie back a bit (dropping it from a four to three star rating) was the fact that, at times, it tried to take itself a bit too seriously. This is best personified in the film's focus on Tom Berenger's character, who is the only character that really has any kind of backstory whatsoever. True, his inspiration is needed to rally the troops towards the end of the season, but all the scenes involving his personal life/romance really just make you wish you could get back to the baseball diamond.Thus, although Major League is considered to be one of the classic baseball films of all-time (and I will admit it has its share of iconic moments and characters), it suffers a bit from wandering too far from the formula that made it that way...comedy. If you don't mind a little clichéd sappiness with your humor, though, you won't have a problem. I recommend watching this film just for the sheer experience of it, but don't be expecting the come away with it ranking in your Top Ten.",6,1,3,11 March 2017
The Dark Knight," The Greatest Superhero Movie Ever
","In Christopher Nolan's first interpretation of the Caped Crusader, 'Batman Begins', he hints at the notion that Batman will always be a controversial or vigilante figure, never fully accepted by society-at-large. In this film, that theme is explored in-depth, as Batman comes face-to-face with his most difficult challenge: stopping a figure, The Joker, who is more like The Bat then Bruce Wayne (or, in turn, the audience) wants to admit.The central theme of this film, then, has the marvelously insane Joker (played brilliantly by the late Heath Ledger) pitted against our 'heroic' Batman. Of course, things are not that black and white. As the movie begins, with Batman leading the police force's effort to crack down on mob crime, this creates a back-lash of sorts that makes Batman responsible for every nefarious deed committed by the Joker. The conundrum is this: Although Batman created The Joker through vigilante methods, those same vigilante methods are the only way to stop the cackling madman.Essentially, every scene in this film is either a sight to behold, or gripping emotional drama. Any scene featuring Ledger's Joker is brilliant, while Christian Bale takes his Wayne/Batman character up a notch in intensity from the first film. The penultimate confrontation between the two will have you on the edge of your seat. The action scenes are also a notch better than Nolan's first effort, as they are filmed with IMAX cameras that lend themselves to incredible, sprawling action.Finally, the ensemble cast featuring Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman are spot-on in their respective roles.If you are at all a fan of superhero movies, I can nearly guarantee that this film will top your list after viewing. Even if you typically don't care for this genre, the acting is so tremendous, the action is so riveting, and the drama is so thought-provoking that you will feel like you just watched an Oscar-worthy masterpiece. I only need two hands to list the movies that warrant multiple viewings by me, but when this film lands on DVD I will snap it up again in a heartbeat.",10,1,4,12 March 2017
Everest," Exactly What You Would Expect (For Better Or Worse)
","Right now, take a minute and think about what you would expect from a movie like 'Everest'. Have that thought in your head? Well, that is exactly what 'Everest' is...no more, no less.For a basic plot summary, 'Everest' tells the story (based on real-life experiences) of a group of climbers attempting to ascend to the mountain's summit in 1996. The problem that year, however, was that there was more traffic than ever before at the base of the mountain. Seemingly everyone wanted to make that climb on a single weekend. As such, the groups led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) & Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) decide to team up in order to reduce traffic and increase the likelihood of success. What they don't count on? A terrific storm that whips up and threatens every single climber on the mountain.First and foremost, 'Everest' is very much a traditional 'based on a true story' survival type of film. All the typical beats, characters, and situations you've seen in disaster movies are all present and accounted for. Not until the last 30 minutes or so does it really produce anything unique or off the beaten path. Depending on your point of view, this could raise or lower the overall star ranking quite a bit. I went into the movie not knowing what to expect, and just by personal preference was a bit disappointed in that I like films that stretch storytelling boundaries a bit. This film doesn't do that (mainly through no fault of its own, as it is based on a true story), so just as long as you know that going in you'll know what you are in for.Besides being relatively 'paint by numbers' in terms of storytelling, 'Everest' does enough things right for even someone like me to still get something out of the experience. The visuals are stunning, the acting is well done, and those last 30 or so minutes provide some legitimate unexpected moments and emotional material.What it comes down to with 'Everest', then, is that your enjoyment will almost wholly be based on your expectations and what type of movie you like. If you love 'true stories' and survival tales, this one is for you. If you (like me) are looking for a bit more dramatized plots and originality in technique, you might be a little disappointed. Again, the film can only 'be what it can be', obviously, so that is why your mindset going in may just determine the star ranking coming out.",6,2,3,1 March 2017
Friends with Benefits," When Justin Met Mila
","In 1989, Meg Ryan faked an orgasm, Billy Crystal droned about 'sex getting in the way' of male- female friendship, and the basis for nearly every romantic comedy since was formed 'When Harry Met Sally'. This film follows the same basic premise...but at the same time turns it completely on its head.For a basic plot summary, 'Friends with Benefits' sees 'headhunter' (or business recruiter) Jamie (Mila Kunis) meet Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and try to convince him to move to New York City to work for GQ. After seeing the sights and getting to know each other a bit, Jamie & Dylan (in order to avoid all the 'complications' of a normal relationship) decide to engage in a 'just sex' type of mutual agreement. From there, of course, things begin to veer off course and get a bit tenuous between the two.Considering that this type of film has been done to death, 'Friends With Benefits' is actually pretty good. Justin & Mila have great on-screen chemistry, the plot is a good mix of sappy & serious, and (at times) it will make you laugh (although many of those will be uncomfortable chuckles if watching with an audience).Besides the irreverent fare (which would probably prevent this movie from being a 'classic' anyway), the only problem I had with this film was how strange it was for the two leads to be playing against type. Usually, Timberlake is the 'crazy guy' and Kunis is the 'uptight witchy girl'...that is how we are accustomed to seeing those actors. Here, however, Timberlake is a bit more reserved while Kunis goes through a gambit of emotions from beginning to end. The chemistry between the two, as I mentioned, was great, but it was awkward seeing them against type.Overall, though, this is a decent rom-com that provides (in equal parts): sexual escapades, tongue-in-cheek humor, character development, & an engaging plot. It may not be an all-time great, but 'Friends with Benefits' most definitely has its moments.",6,1,1,10 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Never Fully Captures The Epic Moments From the Book
","Though undoubtedly a bit drawn out, the novel version of 'Order of the Phoenix' does contain its share of epic moments. I thought that this movie version would be an improvement, as it would be able to separate the 'wheat from the chaff', so to speak, and keep the action flowing. What actually happens, however, is that the movie never slows down enough to savor those great moments, instead pushing forward relentlessly from beginning to end.For a basic plot summary, 'Phoenix' begins with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) defending himself at the Ministry of Magic after using a Patronus Charm to defeat some Dementors near Privet Drive. Upon returning to Hogwarts, Harry discovers that the school is slowly being turned into a mouthpiece of Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) with the appointment of Delores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as a central figure. Soon, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), & Hermoine (Emma Watson) get some first-hand experience dealing with the 'politics of magic', so to speak.The film version of 'Phoenix' is basically a class-A example of a movie not living up to the novel. It is just a little odd for this series considering that all the previous movies were very favorably toward their books' source materials. The trouble here is that director David Yates doesn't quite know when to 'slow down' and savor the moment (or even what those right moments are).For example (spoilers ahead)...-Some very interesting material regarding why Harry must always stay with the Dursleys is completely excised. This was a key portion of the book that really ties up some loose story ends. -Also gone is a very touching 'Weasley is our King' Quidditch angle from the book. Instead, Grint's Ron is given nothing to do in this one. -Umbridge is treated with a comical air instead of the malice she should personify. in fact, her first appearances in the Hogwarts halls are set to a sort of music video montage totally unbecoming of what her character should be. -The final climactic battle featuring Dumbledore (Micheal Gambon) and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) carries none of the gravitas of the novel (or even lives up to the Potter/Voldemort scenes at the end of 'Goblet of Fire). It just falls flat.One thing that the movie does get right, however, is spending a least a bit more time (though still far less than the book) rounding out the auxiliary cast. The Weasley Twins (James & Oliver Phelps), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), & Cho Chang (Katie Lueng) get more screen time than ever before, while newcomer Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) is a great new addition to the cast.Thus, while 'Order of the Phoenix' isn't a terrible movie by any means, it is the first of the Potter movies to significantly be worse than its source-material novel. Too many key moments are missing, while the ones that do show up aren't allowed to be savored like they should.",6,1,1,6 March 2017
Toy Story," Everyone Loves Toys
","Until the Disney-Pixar collaboration that produced this wonderful film, movies were pretty much lopped into two basic categories: child & adult. Children would be lost, bored, terrified, or scarred by the adult fare, while adults would be lost, bored, and uncomfortable at the kiddie flicks. Fortunately, 'Toy Story' changed everything.For a basic plot summary, this all-CGI film focuses on the childhood toys of young Andy. At first, Andy is in his 'cowboy stage', and so western doll Woody (Tom Hanks) is his prized possession. However, once Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) arrives via an extra-special birthday present, things begin to change inside the toybox, as the two begin a battle for supremacy over young Andy.There are two main areas in which this movie succeeds so brilliantly: First, it is incredible eye- candy for children. Running the gamut from every type of toy and crazy situation imaginable, this film enraptures the kiddies and will have them watching over and over.Second, it works because you will be watching it over and over with them! As you marvel at the CGI effects, you will also be laughing at the hilarious jokes that, while going right over your kid's head, will make you burst into laughter. This is mainly accomplished by the cast of 'supporting' characters such as the wise-cracking Hamm (John Ratzenberger), the cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), the loyal dog Slink (Jim Varney), and the ever-sardonic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). Their jokes and humorous situations will make it feel as if you aren't watching a kids movie at all.Also, though the technology has come a long way even since this film's 1995 release date, it is still no less of a filmmaking marvel. For perhaps the first time in cinema history, computer- animation actually made you feel as if you were watching a 'real' film, not just a cheap special- effects bonanza.Overall, 'Toy Story' is one of the most influential films ever produced for its ability to blur the lines between children and adult cinema. For the first time, parents were truly able to enjoy a movie with their children.",9,1,2,11 March 2017
Men in Black," Something Completely New
","On the surface, a film featuring the straight-laced Tommy Lee Jones fighting aliens would seem to be a terrible idea. However, throw in some humor from Will Smith and some great filmmakers, and all of a sudden you have created a classic, genre-busting experience.For a basic plot summary, 'Men in Black' sees Agent K (Jones) policing hidden aliens that constitute our planet unbeknownst to the general population. But, since K is starting to get a bit long in the tooth, he sets about bringing a little bit of new blood into the MIB organization, which is where James Edwards (Smith), an NYPD street cop, comes into the picture.The chemistry between Jones (the 'straight man') and Smith (the 'cutup') is what really makes this movie fun to watch. Their banter back and forth never stops from beginning to end and is always good for a chuckle.Of course, just the concept of the film alone is unique in and of itself. Though the potential for utter failure was quite high, director Barry Sonnenfield (with probably more than a little help from executive producer Steven Spielberg) manages to make the film take itself just seriously enough to work, not but not seriously enough to prevent a lot of fun from creeping into the screenplay.Overall, 'Men in Black' is just a fun film that (in its day) was something completely new to the cinematic landscape. Unless you just really aren't into the often goofy nature of the movie, you will enjoy the special effects and witty banter thoroughly.",8,2,3,3 March 2017
Midsommar," Perhaps The Strangest Movie Of 2019
","When the credits rolled on my 'Midsommar' watching experience, my first thought was 'that was the strangest movie I've seen in quite some time'. I probably should not have been surprised, seeing as how this was director Ari Aster's next project after the equally quirky 'Hereditary'. While I can't go so far as to say that the strangeness of 'Midsommar' made it one of my favorite films, I did--aside from one fatal flaw--enjoy the overall experience.For a very basic overview, 'Midsommar' sees young adult Dani (Florence Pugh) going through a hard time. Her entire family is destroyed by an incredibly traumatic event, and to top things off boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) is waffling within the relationship. Somewhat reluctantly, Christian and his fellow dissertation-searching friends invite Dani on their trip to Sweden to study Midsommar festivals. What they all find is an experience unlike anything that has ever been witnessed.The setup in this film is generally very solid. The whole process sort of reminds me of films like 'Get Out' or 'Us', where the filmmakers do a great job of creating authentic characters while surrounding them with an air of mystery. In the journey to the actual festival, all the characters here seem like they could be playing out a very believable scenario, and that makes them ultra-relatable.Once at the crazy Swedish festival, the film is sort of a combination of 'The Village' and 'The Wicker Man'. While the proceedings start off as fairly innocuous, the bizarreness of the whole thing slowly unveils itself. Very well-paced in terms of not getting too crazy too fast, while also getting in enough scares/thrills to satisfy the audience.A lot of praise so far, so why the seven-star rating? Because 'Midsommar' suffers from one fatal flaw:(Warning: Heavy spoilers ahead!)This is very much a metaphor film. If taken literally, the events make very little sense. Only after looking at it from a certain lens do the pieces begin to fall into place. Essentially, the entire movie is Dani's grief experience of losing her family and then not being supported by her boyfriend. In order for that to 'work', though, the film needed to make it more clear that Christian was indeed a dead-beat, lame partner. In all honesty, the down-to-earth quality of the character writing might have actually hurt the film in this regard, as I never got the sense that Christian was an out-and-out villain. As the film itself expressly states, 'maybe Dani is being too clingy/needy?'. While surely not ultra-supportive, I just never got that sense that Christian was the 'big bad' here, and without that the overall metaphor (especially the ending) falls a bit flat.Overall, though, 'Midsommar' fascinated me enough for me to give it solid marks. The major misstep described above prevented me personally from totally buying in, but I can easily see others not having that problem (provided they recognize it for the metaphor journey that it is, of course).",7,6,8,3 February 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Will Forever Change The Way You View Cinema (And Jim Carrey)
","For many years, I have been a fan of Jim Carrey's wacky brand of comedy. I consider 'Dumb and Dumber' and 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' to be the funniest movies of all-time, and can watch them over and over without fail. However, I had always been skeptical about his ability to pull off a really dramatic role. Sure, he was decent in 'The Majestic' and 'The Truman Show', but in my mind he would always be typecast as that goofy guy with the impossibly stretchy face and crazy voice accents. That all changed after viewing 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.Though trying to give a brief plot description of this film is like trying to determine what 'Alice in Wonderland' was really all about, the basic premise centers on the two characters of Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Kate Winslet). When their once-loving relationship begins to fail miserably, both opt to partake in a new scientific procedure in which all memories of that person are erased from your brain. Clementine completes the operation with no difficult, but Joel has a much harder time letting go, and his journey through his own mind (as he re-lives his relationship with Clem) comprises much of the film.To me, one of the greatest compliments you can give a film (ala Back To The Future) is to not quite know what genre to place it in. Walk into your local video store (or peruse any online source) and you could find this movie in 'Comedy' (for Carrey's name and subtle touches), 'Romance' (for the lead relationship), 'Drama' (for the aching love story), or even 'Action' (for the incredible visual sequences that director Michel Gondry composes). The only two films I can remember watching that took my breath any at the end are 'Vanilla Sky' and 'The Sixth Sense', and this one tops those by a considerable margin.The acting is also fantastic. Remarkably, Carrey makes a strong case that this may be the best role he's ever played (comedy included), while Winslet is every bit his equal in terms of character depth. I could have started the movie right back at the beginning after finishing it and still enjoyed their performances (as well as excellent auxiliary cast that shines in their respective roles).Thus, though I wasn't expecting all that much when pressing the 'Play' button on this one, it instantly jumped into the top ten films I have ever laid eyes on. PLEASE go out and find this movie somewhere if you consider yourself a movie fan whatsoever. It will absolutely astound you.",10,1,2,11 March 2017
Taken," Jack Bauer: The Retirement Years
","While watching 'Taken', the first thing that crossed my mind was: 'Wow, this could be the story of fictional TV character Jack Bauer's retirement years!'. Considering the success of 24, suffice it to say that I mean that as a compliment and thoroughly enjoyed this film.Basically, the plot of this film centers on Liam Neeson's character, who is estranged from his daughter (played by Maggie Grace) and really has no way back into her life anymore. Though tenuous about her decision to travel to Europe for a summer with a friend, he knows that not signing the consent form will only further drive a wedge between them, so he allows it. Of course, her and the friend are immediately targeted by European slave traders and kidnapped right out of their apartment, sending Neeson into action to try and get them back. The kicker, though, is that 'Neeson', now retired, was once a government agent who worked for an agency not unlike that of 'CTU' of '24' fame (at least that is how it is described). As a result, Neeson actually has a fair shot at tracking down his daughter's abductors for the remainder of the movie.What really separates this movie from other action fare, though, is the character development at the very beginning. Where other pure action films (Eagle Eye comes to mind) spend just a few precious minutes to develop the characters, the entire first 30 minutes (out of only 90 total) of 'Taken' really fleshes out the father-daughter relationship. This makes you the viewer root even harder for Neeson cause when his daughter is taken.The acting is also very solid, albeit in a subdued fashion (at least from Neeson). Whereas Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer emotes wildly and often, Neeson's take on 'government agent' is much more simmeringly intense. We understand how badly he wants his daughter back, but he doesn't have to pitch a fit to convince us. Also, Grace ('Shannon' of LOST fame) transitions from well from small to big screen, as her innocent portrayal of a young girl also helps the audience become emotionally involved with the film.Thus, while this film is not epic in any sense of the word (hence the four-star rating), it is still very entertaining in a straight-forward sort of way by doing all the things that a good film should: developing characters, creating emotional attachments, and having enough of a plot to keep the action moving forward. If you are a fan of the 'thriller' genre, please check this movie out...it may not shoot straight to the top of your 'favorite movies' list, but you will also likely not be disappointed, either.",8,1,2,12 March 2017
Avatar," If I Wanted A Sermon, I'd Go To Church...
","When 'Avatar' first hit the theaters back in early December of 2009, I really didn't have an overwhelming urge to see it, as I'm usually very skeptical of films that base their hype on CGI- based graphics (as they usually overshadow such important elements as plot and character development). However, with the film surpassing Titanic as #1 all-time in box office revenues, I figured I would give it a shot, thinking maybe I really was missing out on something special. Unfortunately, the film did much, much worse, as I left the theater wondering how such a shallow movie could now be on top of the heap.The number one flaw in the film is one that it truly cannot recover from in any other aspect: a terribly shallow plot. If you have seen Pocahontas (white man must learn the ways of the natives) or Dances With Wolves (disgruntled military officer sympathizes with former enemy), you have seen Avatar. There really is nothing else.Adding to that fatal flaw is the high-handed directing of James Cameron. While some great directors (Clint Eastwood immediately comes to mind here) will present an interesting palette of characters and let the viewers decide what they may about them, Cameron instead chooses to be rigid in his character definition. For example, the military is evil, scientists are greedy, and all natives are perfect in their commune with nature. If you have your head in the clouds, then perhaps those kinds of moralist viewpoints will appeal to you. For the rest of us, it is quite sickening. Basically, it turns into 162 minutes of Cameron slapping you across the face with his environmental/naturalist themes.Thus, as far as character development is concerned, it practically does not exist. Besides the utterly predictable transformation of the 'one good white man' and his assimilation into the native culture, no other background is explored on any character. I am fully confident that any decent writer could sit down and, within a day, put together a much more interesting backstory on certain aspects of the film (military, scientists, etc.) that would actually make the conflicts of the film compelling, other than the bleeding-heart sap it turned out to be.Plus, and this is truly the coupe-de-grace of failure, the CGI produces some great images, but unless you are a complete tech-head, it isn't really anything to fawn over. For example, the sinking of the Titanic in Cameron's other big film was just as eye-popping as anything that Avatar put up on the screen.To be honest, it really makes me shake my head that a movie like this can not only succeed in this country, but do so in record capacity. Have we really become so thoughtless and simple to reduce humanity to such black-and-white constructs? I'm sure that the Academy Award voters will have a field day with such themes and turn the ceremony into Cameron's own private ego- massaging, but I for one do not see it that way. If you are looking for a great director who will really make you think about humanity, try the later films of Clint Eastwood.",2,2,5,11 March 2017
Toy Story 2," Is There Such A Thing As A Perfect Film?
","After the first Toy Story film (released in 1995) wowed audiences, the public clamored (despite the Pixar policy of not making animated films into sequel franchises) for an encore. Thus, in 1999, Toy Story 2 was released and, remarkably, surpassed even the highest of expectations, besting the original (no small feat).For a basic plot summary, this film sees Sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) get 'kidnapped' by a money-hungry toy collector, who needs the Woody doll to complete the now-infamous set from the classic 'Woody's Roundup' TV show (the origins of the Woody doll). With Andy away at cowboy camp, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toybox gang plot and execute a rescue mission. Little do they know, though, that Woody, upon meeting the rest of his gang-- Stinky Pete (Kelsey Grammar), horse Bullseye, and Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack)--forms a bond that may lead him to spend the rest of his shelf-life inside a museum.What really makes this film work is that the writers/producers made the brilliant decision to include Woody's backstory into the movie, as it would have been very easy to focus (once again) on Buzz and have the cowboy play second-fiddle. Instead, the story actually hones in on Woody and the big decisions he must make. Of course, the entire film is also filled with hilarious sight gags, situations, and jokes that both children and adults will enjoy with equal enthusiasm. In terms of both humor and storytelling, this effort eclipses the original by quite a wide margin.Plus, the addition of the Bullseye and Jessie characters are welcome (and vital) new additions to the show, as their presence leads to some pretty tense emotional drama. In a music-video montage involving the girl Jessie doll, you may find yourself holding back (or letting go) tears. The best part of it is, you won't even feel as if you are watching nothing but a bunch of carefully constructed pixels...you will come to view them as characters as real as you or I.Thus, in a remarkable feat, Pixar was able to improve on the ground-breaking original Toy Story and take things up even another notch. As Toy Story 3 currently begins playing in theatres across the country, it will be interesting to see if the ante will be upped once again. As usual, it will be a difficult task.",10,1,3,10 March 2017
Invictus," Don't Expect Past Eastwood Greatness...But Still Okay
","Whenever I see the name 'Clint Eastwood' associated with a new moving coming to theaters, I automatically think of such incredible films as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, and Gran Torino. Perhaps I am just spoiled by Eastwood's spotless track record, but that is the reality of the situation. With that in mind, Invictus does not live up to the billing...but it still is a very honorable effort.Basically, the film takes place primarily in the country of South Africa, where Nelson Mandela (played superbly by Morgan Freeman) has come to power and is striving to bridge the gap between blacks and whites after decades of apartheid rule. Mandela seizes upon the country's terrible rugby team, stocked primarily by high-brow, burly white men, as a symbol of unity for the country. He tabs Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon) to captain the team and make them respectable (if not a whole lot more) heading into the World Cup. The rest, as they say, is history.Now, I can't say that this film was outright bad in any way. The race-relations message is one that resonates, the rugby team is certainly inspirational, and the acting is pretty good as well, led by the remarkable Freeman as one of the world's most storied leaders. Yet, unlike 'Torino' or 'Baby', the word I would use to describe this film is 'understated'. Instead of walloping viewers over the head with such heavy topics as euthanasia, religion, or death, in this effort Eastwood takes a much more low-key approach. There is drama, yes, and plenty of inspiration, but it just doesn't feel as epic as it could have been. Whether this was Eastwood trying to 'follow the facts' as much as possible, or the real-life story just not providing the high drama of a fully scripted film, I'm not sure.Thus, if you are heading to the theater expecting utter greatness like I was, you will likely leave disappointed. However, if the topics/events/times in the film are of significant personal or cultural importance to you, then Invictus will automatically garner a five-star rating for its factual portrayal of the events that transpired.",6,1,3,12 March 2017
La La Land," Can A Movie Be A Classic From Its Opening Weekend?!
","Every once in awhile, a movie comes along that is so good that it almost feels strange to have lived in a world where the film didn't exist. 'La La Land' is exactly that type of movie.For a basic plot summary, 'La La Land' tells the story of two young people trying to make a go of it in Los Angeles: Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a jazz musician with a dream of opening his own club. Mia (Emma Stone) is an aspiring actress who never seems to have any luck in her auditions. After a couple of chance meetings, however, they discover that it may just take their beliefs in each other to make those dreams come true.'La La Land' is a kind of throwback movie to Old Hollywood in that it is a musical filled with many singing and dancing numbers. Each song is spectacular (a production in and of itself) and is important to the overall plot and character development within the film. I can all but guarantee that you will be listening to the soundtrack for days, weeks, or potentially longer.Perhaps what makes this an all-time classic from the opening credits, however, is its ability to combine those musical numbers with a rock-solid plot. This isn't a 'fluff' picture by any stretch of the imagination, as it contains deep themes of perseverance, the power of relationships, and following one's dreams. The songs, dances, plots, and characters all weave together to create a perfect tapestry of emotion.It doesn't hurt, obviously, that the chemistry between leads Gosling and Stone is absolutely off- the-charts...truly the stuff of legends. I now sort of understand why audiences some 80-90 years ago. Cultivated from their first film together ('Crazy Stupid Love'), the Gosling-Stone combination was perfect for 'La La Land', as the relationship between their characters is what makes the whole thing work.I could go on and on about the ways in which I was supremely impressed by 'La La Land', but suffice it to say here that it was one of the most entertaining, emotional journeys that the cinema has taken me on in quite some time. This film will likely sweep the Academy Awards, and I wouldn't be disappointed if that indeed happens. My brother recently moved out to LA to pursue his own filmmaking dream, so 'La La Land' also hit me on a personal level. For anyone who wants to pursue a dream, though, this is the movie for you.",10,6,13,27 February 2017
Super 8," A Little Bit Of Everything
","Despite being a fan of J.J. Abrams and what he does with his Bad Robot productions, I'll be the first to say it: At its core, 'Super 8' is J.J.'s homage to his childhood cloaked in the storytelling techniques of Steve Spielberg. However, because JJ imparts so much of his own flare and personal charisma into the film, it ends up mostly transcending its 'copycat' label and producing a result that is quite enjoyable on a number of fronts.For a basic plot summary, 'Super 8' focuses on Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young teen growing up in the 1970s who loves making movies with his Super-8 camera and building miniature models. When viewers are introduced to Joe, he has just lost his mother in a factory accident, and father Jackson (Kyle Chandler) struggles to be a single father while also serving as town police deputy. While filming a movie scene with his buddies, and notably crush Alice (Elle Fanning), Joe witnesses a train derailment in which some sort of creature is released and the military intervenes. With the film in Joe's camera being the only evidence of the incident, 'Super 8' unspools into a race against the clock both for the military (to destroy the evidence) and Joe's crew (to figure out just what exactly is going on).I think the hallmark of 'Super 8' is that it's a film that has a little bit of everything. It features tremendous action/adventure sequences, emotional family/character drama, and a mystery plot that keeps things moving forward. There is not one wasted scene in the entire film. Though it clocks in at about 2 hours, it doesn't feel 'that long' because the action is always moving forward (a trait of Abrams films).The use of the child actors in the movie are also spectacular. They carry long (and most) stretches of the film with absolutely no qualms or drop in performances that adults may have given. In a way, JJ was kind of ahead of the curve here on the 'kids riding bikes around the neighborhood' type film that 'It' & 'Stranger Things' would later bring firmly back into fashion.Oddly enough, the only reason I can't give 'Super 8' an even higher ranking is a big part of the reason why it gets the 8 stars to begin with: The film is so slick and filled with relentless energy that I felt, at times, it doesn't take quite enough time to stop and savor the character moments (the highlight of the film by quite a bit). This is especially apparent in the ending, which should be even more touching than what ends up transpiring. This isn't a huge fault, but I think stems from the film coming from a Spielberg/nostalgia place instead of one of complete originality.Overall, though, 'Super 8' is a fun and compelling film that can be enjoyed by a wide swath of audiences. No one will ever be bored watching the film, and it dips into enough genres to find some nerve in every viewer. Not quite at the top of my 'favorites of all-time' list, but certainly in the tier right below it.",8,1,2,15 July 2018
Up," 'Gran Torino' For The Family Set
","A few years ago, I watched the film 'Gran Torino' and was completely blown away by director Clint Eastwood's take on themes such as aging, friendship, and coming to terms with one's own life. However, those who are easily offended (by either harsh language or non-political correctness) would likely not be able to get past those hang-ups, while kids are ruled out altogether. Thankfully, Pixar's 'Up' explores those same themes in a much more family-friendly fashion.Basically, the story centers on Carl Fredricksen, a senior citizen widower who's being cajoled out of his old relic of a house by construction ('progress') on all sides of him. Instead of going out smoothly, though, Carl decides (being a retired balloon salesman) to fly his home (via a gaggle of helium balloons!) to Paradise Falls, the mystical place that him and his deceased wife Ellie always dreamed of, but never quite realized. However, there is one hitch in the plan...that being the completely helpless boy scout, Russell, who just happened to be on the wrong porch at the wrong time. As they make their way towards the falls, Carl and Russell encounter a slew of new characters and challenges, making it truly an adventure in every sense of the word.The first level that this film really works at is with the kiddies...the intended viewers. There are enough sight gags (involving the rotund Russell and crotchety Carl) and crazy characters (the talking dog 'Dug'...squirrel!) to keep their interest the whole runtime.However, on a much deeper level, this film will truly move even the most adult of viewers. An amazing sequence towards the beginning of the film depicts the marriage (both the ups and the downs) of Carl and Ellie, and really sets up Carl's character development as he is forced to venture out into the world again and bond with young Russell. With each passing moment (and new adventure), viewers get the feeling that Carl is taking another small step closer to making a clean break from the past and living for the here and now. The scene where he finally realizes that fact is enough to make your eyes begin to water.Thus, I consider 'Up' to be the pinnacle (at least so far) of animated films for its ability to make you laugh, tantalizing your senses, and really draw you into the characters and their successes/struggles.",8,1,2,11 March 2017
Groundhog Day," Iconic Film, Though Perhaps Doesn't Try As Hard As It Should
","There is no doubt that 'Groundhog Day' is an iconic film based on the concept alone. It can also be hilariously funny, a tribute to Bill Murray's deadpan style of humor. It has almost become as iconic on the holiday it depicts as the little rodent itself! All of that being said, 'Groundhog Day' also strikes me as a movie that, if it would have tried just a bit harder, could have been an all-time classic, overtaking the cult/niche status it currently owns.For a basic plot summary, 'Groundhog Day' tells the story of Phil (Murray), a dissatisfied TV weather man in his fourth year of covering 'that giant overgrown squirrel' in Punxsutawney. He goes through the motions, then gets stuck in the quaint PA town due to a horrendous blizzard. The next morning, he wakes up to the same song ('I Got You Babe') playing on the radioand discovers that it is the same day: February 2nd. Phil quickly discovers that he is trapped in a time loop of sorts, where the calendar resets to Feb. 2 at 6:00 AM each morning. At first, Phil is despondent about this life development on the day he so loathes, but as enough Feb 2's pile up he begins to realize the power that one person can have when given an unlimited quantity of time.At its heart, 'Groundhog Day' is a comedy and features some of the most hilarious moments every put to screen, including-Phil's multiple reporting (with him becoming more exasperated and finally inspired) on the groundhog emerging from the burrow. -Stealing money from the bank truck by predicting a series of coordinated events. -Ned (Stephen Tobolowsky), that annoying former HS graduate of Phil's who eventually gets his comeuppance.It helps that Murray is cast perfectly, as his deadpan expression and style of humor are spot-on for having him move from unlike-able to a somewhat sympathetic character by the end. There is even an attempt (yes, I say attemptsee below) at a romance with fellow news person Rita (Andie MacDowell) that tries to provide the emotional backbone of the film.Here's the rub, though: 'Groundhog Day' will never make it onto my 'all-time classic' film list. I can watch it every few years, but that is about it. The reason? It's a film that seems to coast by on the high concept and Murray's popularity at the time. It's like the filmmakers said 'we know we have a winner here' and as such didn't put the 'finishing touches' on the product. Some of the things that bug me about the film include:-The romance is so unrealistic that it is tough to get swept up in. Phil & Rita loathe each other at the beginning of each day, yet we are supposed to believe they can fall madly in love by the end of any given day. I realize that Phil's ability to show compassion is a key plot point, but I always found it a bit absurd that it could be towards/with Rita. -Do we ever actually figure out why Phil becomes stuck in the loop? I realize that isn't the point of the story, but it would have been nice to clarify what is happening. -This is going to sound like an oxymoron, but the middle gets a bit repetitive. I enjoyed 'fearful Phil' when he is beginning to realize what is happening as well as 'confident Phil' when he gets a handle on his surroundings, but the middle section dragged a bit in showing the same events perhaps a bit too much. I read that the original script had the viewer plopped into the middle of the sequence (instead of telling it chronologically), and I think I would have liked that better.Overall, 'Groundhog Day' is a solid, funny film that has come to personify the holiday it associates itself with (no small task in its own right). I can enjoy the concept and laugh at the best gags, but only in small doses (hence the four-star rating).",8,1,2,5 February 2017
Love & Mercy," The Brian Wilson Story
","When done right, a biopic film can be quite a sight to behold for the potential it is to combine drama, real-life, and music. Fortunately, 'Love & Mercy' is most definitely done right, relaying the story of Brian Wilson and his relation to the band he created...The Beach Boys.For a basic plot summary, 'Love & Mercy' tells an intertwining dual-narrative tale: A young Brian Wilson (Paul Dano) is rising to fame with The Beach Boys, while at the same time succumbing to his mental demons. While the rest of the band wants to 'ride the wave' (pun intended) of their skyrocketing success, Brian feels artistically compelled (one might say maniacally driven) to do his own thing. An alcoholic and un-supportive father (played by Bill Camp) finally pushes Brian over the edge, prompting him to shack up in his room for years on end. Fast-forward about 30 years into the future and Wilson (John Cusack), now quite an odd fellow but at least out in society again, happens to meet a car saleswoman named Melinda Ledbetter (Elizabeth Banks) and strike up a friendship (that may also be a bit romantic). Melinda discovers that Brian is now closely watched (guarded) by one Dr. Eugene Landy (Paul Giamatti), on a strict program of pills and tough discipline. The doctor says it is for Brian's own good, but Melinda has her own serious doubts about that.The first thing that needs to be understood about 'Love & Mercy' is that it isn't a 'Beach Boys biopic'. It's a 'Brian Wilson biopic'. Sure, the other Beach Boys members are prominently featured as is their music throughout, but the narrative focus is squarely on Brian Wilson. So, those looking for a retrospective on the history of the group might be a little disappointed.This is probably a good choice, however, as Brian's story is probably the most interesting thing TO focus on. From his relationships to family, friends, fellow band members, and (in the later years) society as a whole, Brian battled mental illness and extreme anxiety. I hadn't realized that he also looked to be severely taken advantage of by Dr. Landy. Just a fascinating human-interest story all-around.Like all great musical biopics, 'Love & Mercy' needed great music and got exactly that! You'll be listening to Beach Boys tunes for awhile after the viewing is over. The acting is also very convincing. Both the young/old Wilson actors are spot-on, while Banks shows she can hold down a very serious, emotional role (moving away from the dirty rom-coms and crazy Effie character from the Hunger Games she had come to be known for). Of course, it's a historical picture, so Giamatti is in it (!).About the only caveat I could give to this film is that it might not play quite as well if you know nothing about the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson. I knew the basic story going in, so was able to pick up on all the requisite beats. I'd be interested to hear if others (who know nothing about the topic) were able to do the same.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed 'Love & Mercy' for its combination of drama, music, and historical realism. The scenes from the past are capable of producing great nostalgia, while those set in Wilson's 'older years' tell a compelling story that many may not know.",10,7,9,28 February 2017
Total Recall," An Action Movie That Also Bends The Mind
","'Total Recall', at its core, is a straight-up action vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger. At least, that is what it was supposed to be. However, it actually succeeds so much more as a psychological thriller thanks to director Paul Verhoeven and an incredible script.For a basic plot summary, 'Total Recall' follows the very strange set of circumstances surrounding one Douglas Quaid (Schwarzenegger), who one day is living the married life with Lori (Sharon Stone), and the next moment is caught up in an intrigue plot involving a stunning vixen named Melina (Rachel Ticotin) who tells Quaid he is not exactly what (or who) he thinks he is. But is the whole thing a virtual-reality experience?This movie succeeds because it manages to successfully indulge in two different genres:-First of all, it is an action/adventure flick on par with Arnie's other works. It is non-stop from the opening scene, rushing forward with special effects (well, special for the time period...!), chase scenes, and tons of gunfire.-Secondly, though, it is also a psychological mind-bender of the highest order. You really won't know exactly what is going on until the final scene (and even then the result will amaze you).Overall, then, I was very impressed with this flick that I didn't have very high expectations for. I expected a simple 'action romp', but instead was treated to so much more. It can be watched for many reasons: the action, the thinking, the acting (actually pretty good), or the nostalgia. Either way, there will more than likely be something for you.",8,4,6,8 March 2017
Beauty and the Beast," True Disney Magic
","When the animated Beauty & the Bast premiered in the early 1990s, that was the peak of animation at that time. One could say the same about this new effort as well, for how it seamlessly blends the animation with its perfect casting to make a beautiful film on a number of different levels.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story that you are accustomed to hearing. Belle (Emma Watson) is a bookworm living in a small, 'boring' village, with an eccentric father (Kevin Kline) and a macho arrogant court-er, Garcon (Luke Evans), making her life difficult. When her father gets lost on a trip back from the market one night, however, he stumbles upon a castle inhabited by a ferocious Beast (Dan Stevens), who once was a prince but now cursed into an animal until he can know true love (explained in the film's preamble). The ever-doting Belle sets out to retrieve her father, also finds the castle, and the rest is history.First off, I thought this film did a wonderful job of portraying the basic story that we all know and love. It doesn't mess with too many plot elements, and even adds in a few new wrinkles (always needed to keep a reboot fresh). The film's plot stands the test of time alone, so in this case I'm glad that Disney didn't try to make too many sweeping changes.Of course, the success/failure of any B&B film is going to come down to the casting of Belle, and Watson is absolutely born to play the role. We're talking once-in-a-lifetime casting here, as there is even synergy between her real life persona and Belle. She is smart/headstrong enough to portray Belle, while also beautiful enough to be a true Disney princess in the golden robe.All the fun auxiliary roles are fun too, what with Cogsworth (Ian McKellen), Lumiere (Ewen McGregor), Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson), and Chip (Nathan Mack), among others, livening up the procedures when necessary. No drop-off from the original here.About the only thing that didn't work for me in the film? Josh Gad's LeFou. Annoying 'gay character' controversy aside, I just felt like his performance was a bit creepy and forced. I think I would have preferred him to be in awe of Gaston rather than in love with him.Finally, as I alluded to in the opening, it is amazing how seamless the interaction of reality and digitization meld together here. In years past, certain characters would have 'looked fake' or it would have had to be fully animated to level the playing field. Not here. Much like 'The Jungle Book' live-action remake before it, B&B is extremely impressive on the eyes.Overall, I thought that 'Beauty & the Beast' was a great take on the old classic. The casting was nearly perfect, the story remained basically intact, and for perhaps the first time in the tale's visual portrayals the meld between human/animal characters dwindles to almost nothing. It may not reinvent the wheel in obvious character or story ways, but the subtle things go a long way in making it a great overall experience that the entire family can enjoy.",8,5,10,25 March 2017
Sicario," Intense Film That Puts You In The Fight Against Drug Cartels
","Director Dennis Villeneuve crashed the Hollywood directors scene in 2013 with the brutal (yet spectacular) 'Prisoners'. Later that same year, he crafted the ingenious mind-bender 'Enemy'. After those two films, I knew I had to see what he would come up with next. 'Sicario' is a much different kind of movie than those previous two, but even so it still manages to showcase Villeneuve's talents behind the camera.For a basic plot summary, 'Sicario' is a story about the Mexican drug cartels. Kate Mercer (Emily Blunt) is a cop who deals with the drug problems caused by the cartels every day. After one particularly frustrating operation, Kate is given the opportunity by her boss (Josh Brolin) to strike at the heart of the problem in Mexico itself. This is a big-time operation, with the decisions being made in it equally as complex. Along for the ride is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a shadowy figure you get the feeling isn't quite who or what he seems.'Sicario' is a solid movie on two levels:First, it really captures the tension of the drug cartel scene. It's like those kind of episodes from 'Breaking Bad', but ratcheting up the intensity tenfold. This genre is not usually my cup of tea in the least, but there is such an atmosphere of tension that I couldn't help but be sucked into the action. There are scenes, like a tense border crossing and a shootout in dug-out cartel tunnels, that will literally have you on the edge of your seat. Not a boring moment in the entire film.Secondly, and perhaps equally as important, Villeneuve is able to take such a serious topic and layer great character narratives on top of it. There are even multiple surprises along the way, including an ending that you won't see coming and would traditionally seem out of place for a typical film of this subject matter. That's why I'm being pretty tight-lipped about the plot, as I don't want to spoil anything. When was the last time you had to worry about spoilers for a drug cartel film?!Thus, I have to say that 'Sicario' was a great success for Villeneuve, as it proves that his unique style can translate into pretty much any kind of cinema format. He's that savvy. This is a great, tense, film that will hold your interest and never let it wane even for a moment. It doesn't matter if you prefer action, narratives, twist, etc., as 'Sicario' provides them all in equal value. I'm very excited to see what this relatively new director can pull out of his bag of tricks next!",9,3,5,26 February 2017
Inside Man," Intriguing Mystery That Always Keeps You Guessing
","'Inside Man' is one of those movies that is hard to pin a ranking too. On one hand, it is an absolute blast to watch and let the mystery unravel. On the other hand, it pretty much does exactly that ('unravel') in the end.For a basic plot summary, this film sees Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) and a crew of henchmen stage a bank robbery. Detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) is quickly called to the scene, only to slowly begin piecing together the notion that perhaps Russell has very different plans for the hostage scenario.'Inside Man' grabs your interest right away and always keeps you guessing. Just when you think you might have a handle on what is going on, it throws you another curveball to keep you on the edge of your seat. As the mysteries continue to deepen, you'll become completely invested in just what the heck Dalton Russell is planning!This is also one of the best Denzel Washington performances ever put to film (and that is saying something). His chemistry with Owen produces some chilling scenes that only heighten the mystery/tension climate of the movie.Here's what keeps this movie from becoming a true classic, though (mild spoilers ahead): It truly is all about the build-up...the resolution really falls flat. 'Inside Man' is squarely one of those films where the journey is far, far more fun than the actual destination.Though 4.5 stars would be ideal for this flick, I bump it up to five because it was just so darn fun to get hooked into the acting/mysteries of the overall experience. If you like fast-paced mysteries or are a big Denzel fan, this one is not to be missed.",9,2,3,6 March 2017
Titanic," An Epic In (Mostly) Every Sense Of The Word
","For those who were of serious movie-watching age in 1997, 'Titanic' was more than just a movie...it was a cultural milestone. In an era before the Internet was as omnipresent as it is today, 'Titanic' still managed to transcend its celluloid and become part of pop culture lore. It easily vaulted to the top of the all-time charts (though has now been passed by 'Avatar' and 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'). However, along the way 'Titanic' gained a bit of a reputation as a 'chick flick', what with 'dreamy Leo' and the somewhat schmaltzy romance between him and Kate Winslet's character. Fortunately, what I've learned after a recent re-watch of the film is that it still manages to hold up as an epic for all-comers (at least for the most part) despite its branding as sappy.For a basic plot summary, 'Titanic' tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), both passengers on the maiden (and obviously final) voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic. Rose is a member of the 'upper crust' first class, pledged to be wed to the stodgy, controlling Cal (Billy Zane). Jack is a free-wheeling vagabond who wins his ticket in a poker game just minutes before the ship departs. On the first night of the voyage, Rose has a breakdown and is about to jump from the bow of the ship...until she is stopped by the charming Jack. A Romeo and Juliet-esque romance begins, coming to a head when the great boat strikes an iceberg and beings taking on water.The main reason I can appreciate 'Titanic' is because I like films that really 'go for it', so to speak. 'Titanic' is meant to be an epic, and director/creator James Cameron pulls out all the stops to make that happen. The visually sequences are stunning (the CGI is a bit visible by today's standards, but not terrible), the scope of the project is momentous, and the romance is just as over-the-top to match. Had a lesser film tried to get away with some of the Jack-and- Rose cheesiness pulled here, it would have been a disaster. But for some reason, it just works in 'Titanic' (again, I think because of the epic nature of the whole project).Cameron also could not have picked a better setting for an epic. We are now over 100 years removed from the fateful sinking, yet it is an event that still carries a high level of fascination...the 'unsinkable ship' sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic. I think Cameron also makes a great decision to go the high-drama route, as this easily could have been turned into an ultra-realistic pseudo-documentary of the event. I'm sure that (knowing Cameron's style) much research was done to make things as accurate as possible, but the fictional presence of Jack and Rose adds that layer of high drama that turns the whole production into a prestige event.The only reason I can't give 'Titanic' the full five stars? Well, there's two, actually: First, Cameron really lays the 'class differences' stuff on thick in the latter stages of the film. It is set up perfectly in the beginning, but as the film drew to a close I wanted to be enthralled by the sinking visuals or swept away in the sheer emotion, not be constantly beaten over the head with the 'first class are conniving snobs while third class are the unsung heroes' trope. I know from 'Avatar' that Cameron has little qualms about obviously sticking his own beliefs into films (and doing so quite heavily), so maybe that's just par for the course for his films. Secondly, I honestly believe that better casting could potentially have been done with the Rose character. In no way do I wish to demean the talents of Kate Winslet, as I know she is a wonderful actress in her own right, but I never felt like she was right for this part. She is great as the uptight Rose, but I never really bought into her as the 'moon-eyed lover' of Jack. It felt odd to me. Luckily, DiCaprio is a joy to behold on screen in the film, so some of the chemistry issues are solved by his sheer enthusiasm.I think that 'Titanic' is one of those movies that got so big, so fast, that now its reputation proceeds it a bit. I found a similar thing happened to the film 'Dead Poet's Society'. Whereas now standing up on a desk to make a point is 'old hat', there was a time when it was truly riveting. That same logic must apply to 'Titanic', too. Whether you are watching it for the first time or re-watching it for the umpteenth time, this is a flick where the slightest bit of cynicism can ruin the entire experience. You have to clear the slate of the mind every single time and enjoy the epic experience for what it is. If you can do that, 'Titanic' is truly a treasure.",8,2,3,25 February 2017
Rocky III," Rocky Goes Hollywood...And Loses Himself
","After conquering Apollo Creed and winning the title in the previous film, in this installment Rocky Balboa must face his toughest opponent yet...himself.For a basic plot summary, 'Rocky III' continues the inspiring story of pugilist Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). After defending his title numerous times against hand-picked opponents, Rocky seems to have lost that 'eye of the tiger' he had in the two Creed fights. At the same time, #1 contender Clubber Lang (Mr. T) is hungry for a shot at the strap (training vigorously while Rocky films commercials). This causes dissension in the Balboa ranks, with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and wife Adrian (Talia Shire) trying to protect Rocky for different reasons.The redeeming portion of this screenplay is the continued character growth of Rocky. For whatever reason (as Sly Stallone had proved himself completely incompetent as a director up to that point), Sly just 'gets' Rocky and knows how to smartly advance the character.The problem is that whereas the first two Rocky films use the fight scenes to cap off the drama, this time the drama is few and far between due to the bloated ring time. Nearly half the movie is spent 'in the ring', and considering the fakey fight scenes, that is not a good thing. Likely because Rocky II was roundly criticized for being too slow to develop, this time the action is fast and furious, though not to the benefit of the overall experience.Another thing that hurts this series is the terrible casting decisions that is Mr. T. He turns in easily the worst performance of the entire six-film series, and this includes a movie starring Dolph Lundgren. He has no sense of choreography in the boxing scenes, and only issues a series of grunts in the acting department.Thus, while 'Rocky III' does enough things right to be watchable, it also does enough tings wrong for me to consider it the worst of the entire franchise.",6,3,6,11 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Visual Awe Vaults It Even Over Book
","If you watch 'Sorcerer's Stone' without reading the book first, there are certain narrative points that you will miss or not quite be as clear on (as usual). However, watching the movie closely following the reading experience will actually expand upon the Potter myth (I gave the first book four stars) due to this film's ability to lay the groundwork of the series in such stunning visuals and characters.For a basic plot summary, 'Sorcerer's Stone' sees young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) living with his aunt and uncle and being mistreated horribly (sleeping in a closet under the stairs, told how rotten he is all the time, etc.). Right before his 11th birthday, however, Harry begins receiving letters from a mysterious owl (as well as a visit from a rather large gentleman riding a flying motorcycle) informing him that he is in fact from wizard lineage. Thus, Harry is whisked away to Hogwarts, a 'Wizard Academy' of sorts, to begin his training. While at Hogwarts, Harry meets new friends Ron (Rupert Grint) & Hermoine (Emma Watson) as well as discovers the mystery behind the death of his parents regarding a shadowy character called Voldemort.In terms of following the novel, this film does a pretty good job of keeping in lock-step. There are certain scenes that are excised for time/continuity and a few 'facts' from the book that are blatantly different from the movie, but other than that it is a great representation.In fact, in a departure from the norm, I actually enjoyed the movie experience better than the book. Why? Because of the way it was able to so wonderfully put a visual to all the great characters. For some, the 'mystery is gone' when they see their literary characters up on the big screen, but in this case I was very pleased to put a face to all these great characters.The movie also has (just like the book) a sense of 'epic-ness' to it. It is very clear that this is only the beginning of an epic series, with more and more mysteries and character development to come.Thus, 'Sorcerer's Stone' is a great cinematic experience that will leave you wanting more as soon as it concludes. The mysteries and characters are paced perfectly, and the story (as it is geared for young adults in the first place) is easy enough to latch onto while nuanced enough to get sucked into.",9,2,3,4 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The First Big Showdown
","During the previous three Harry Potter films, a showdown between Harry Potter & Dark Lord Voldemort was always hinted at but never quite fully conceived. In 'Goblet of Fire', however, that confrontation does indeed finally take place and vaults the series to new heights.For a basic plot summary, 'Goblet' begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), & Hermoine (Emma Watson) attending the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasley family. While at the Cup, the Dark Mark of Voldemort appears in the sky along with a series of attacks on the crowd.. Thus, when the trio report to their fourth year at Hogwarts, it is with an air of caution and suspicion. This is no normal semester at wizarding school, however, as the Tri-Wizard tournament is revived for the first time in ages, allowing the Hogwarts house to see students from other wizarding academies. As the competitions begin, Harry (as usual) plays a key role in the proceedings, as well as the search for Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) followers.In terms of spectacular visuals, the fantastic aspects of the Tri-Wizard tournament make this film a perfect vehicle to really showcase some impressive special effects...which it takes full advantage of. 'Goblet' is a visual treat to observe and really makes it feel as if you are completely immersed in the Potter universe.In keeping with the book, the character development and drama only amps up in this installment. The scenes at the Wizard Ball provide more insight than ever into the relationships between our favorite protagonists, while the big confrontation between Harry and the Dark Lord is absolutely riveting and almost steals the show in and of itself. A better actor than Fiennes could not have been cast for the role, as he truly is a frightening sight to behold.Overall, 'Goblet of Fire' (like its novel namesake) is the best installment of the franchise so far. It perfectly combines adventure, drama, characters, music, and even some lighter moments to create a nice entertaining mixture. A few plot lines from the book are excised completely, but other than that there isn't anything else to criticize here.",Null,2,3,6 March 2017
The Shape of Water," Very Well Made, But Lacked A Real Message
","After seeing 'The Shape of Water' take home the Best Picture award at the latest Oscars ceremony, I wanted to see what the buzz was about (I had been meaning to watch it before-hand but never quite got around to it). After viewing, what I found was that while the film was clearly very well-made, it seemed to lack a solid message to give it real purpose.For a basic plot summary, 'Shape of Water' primarily focuses on Elisa (Sally Hawkins), a mute woman who works as a janitor at a government research facility in 1962. One day, a strange fish-like creature (Doug Jones) is brought onto the premises to be poked, prodded, and otherwise tortured while the U.S. government continues to try and keep one step ahead of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Elisa takes a more sympathetic approach with the new creature, however, and discovers that she must try and rescue it from whatever Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon), the leader of the facility, has in store for it.As I mentioned, technically this is a very sound film. The cinematography is always beautiful, the pacing is excellent (it never feels rushed or boring), and the acting is great throughout the whole thing. Belying what on the outside looks like it could be quite a convoluted, supernatural tale, 'Shape of Water' is actually a very simple film that most viewers will be able to follow quite easily. This is why I can't go any lower than 6/10 stars, as it deserves at least that ranking.That being said, I also felt that this was almost so simple of a film as to be a little pointless sometimes. It never really surprised me in the direction it would go, and there were certain plot threads (like what exactly this aquamarine creature and where did it come from?) that I felt could have been expounded on instead of others. Clearly, the intent here was to create a very simple love story out of a very complicated set of circumstances, and that isn't necessarily my favorite type of filmmaking. In short, I wanted more backstory/information than what I ultimately received from the viewing experience.So, while this would never be my 'best picture' of anything, I can indeed see why it garnered so much Hollywood praise. It's exceptionally well-made, harkens back to old-Hollywood at times, and is very much a simple tale told at a time when such tales are looked upon favorably. It is also a film that can be enjoyed by large swaths of viewers, so that is a big plus as well. It's worth a watch if you are intrigued, but perhaps won't measure up to expectations if you are looking for more in-depth storytelling out of it.",6,4,9,18 March 2018
The Matrix Reloaded," Too Philosophical, Too Fake, Too Confusing
","After being absolutely blown away by the original 'Matrix' film, I was expecting much of the same the second time around. Unfortunately, that is EXACTLY what happened...albeit too much.The major appeal of the first film was that the complex story was put into terms that, while sometimes complicated, most people could still understand. 'Reloaded', however, ratchets that level of difficulty in understanding the subject material into the stratosphere, as characters expounded on the notions of 'rogue computer programs', 'choice', and 'free will'. Far too many times I felt as if I needed undergraduate degrees in philosophy and computer science to understand what the heck was going on!The other readily-apparent flaw in this film was its overuse of action scenes. The first film provided just the right combination of talk vs. action that made the showdown with Agent Smith all the more enjoyable. 'Reloaded' throws scene after scene of intense martial arts at you, in the process making those scenes a whole lot less unique and thrilling. Plus, the scenes are often so over-the top (where it is too obvious for a major motion picture that high-tech computers are used to shoot the entire scene) that the entire film has a fake feel to it.With those major critiques out of the way, however, the film did have its bright spots. For me, the experience of watching this film can be summed up by Neo's meeting with 'The Architect'...though I was fascinated but what was being said, I could only comprehend every third or fourth concept due to the highly-complicated nature of the subject matter. Like I said, one must be almost professionally versed in philosophy and computer programming to know exactly what is transpiring.Overall, then, I would recommend this film to all the hard-core computer programming nerds out there that will be absolutely fascinated by its musings. For the more casual science fiction viewer, however, just try to comprehend as much as you can and wait for the big conclusion coming in the third film.",5,2,5,12 March 2017
Mystic River," Eastwood Still Honing His Craft
","In hindsight, after being attached to incredible films such as 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'Gran Torino', the name 'Clint Eastwood' has become synonymous with 'master director'. In this case, however, it was clear that Eastwood was still honing his craft.For a basic plot summary, 'Mystic River' tells the story of three childhood friends now grown up but still intertwined with each other:-Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): The intense, mob-dealer type who's daughter is murdered and provides the investigative basis for the film. -Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins): At the beginning of the film, as a child, young David is kidnapped and abused. He's clearly never gotten over that experience. -Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon): A cop on the Markum murder case.The good thing about this movie is that it contains enough interesting themes (both physical and emotional) to keep the viewer engaged. You'll really be curious as the movie unfolds to see how all this will turn out.Here's the problem: In a rare moment of Eastwood being 'off', most of those interesting themes either die off with no explanation, or lead to conclusions that are unsatisfying. In, say, 'Million Dollar Baby', Eastwood is perfect in resolving all the themes and character development. In this effort, he fails at that task.That being said, this is still an okay movie. If you don't compare it to Eastwood's better directorial efforts, then it may look even better. Now, is it as good as the Academy thought it was in '03? I beg to differ.",5,7,9,11 March 2017
Zombieland," Just Too Much Fun To Dislike
","I have never been a fan of zombie fare. I usually don't like over-the-top hijinks movies. I prefer my plots (and characters) complex and love it when they make me think. Thus, one would assume that 'Zombieland' is not for me. Yet, I enjoyed the experience because it is just so much doggone fun!For a basic plot summary, 'Zombieland' sees young Columbus (Jesse Eisenburg) surviving in a post-apocalyptic U.S.A filled with zombies. He manages to stay alive by following a strict set of rules like 'always check the back seat' and 'never be the hero', for example. Columbus then finds an unlikely partner in Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), who is a zombie-killing legend. When sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) enter the picture, the foursome must try to cope in a world destroyed by the flesh-eating monsters.What makes this movie work so well is that director Ruben Fleischer knows how silly this genre truly is and thus this whole film is about poking fun at itself. It is kind of ironic that those people (like me) who dislike the zombie genre will probably like 'Zombieland' better than others because of that tongue-in-cheek nature. Zombie material either has to be played perfectly straight (like 'The Walking Dead'), or this completely opposite approach, which lets us laugh at how ridiculous the whole scenario truly is.The acting from that main foursome only helps to suck in viewers, as each of those four turn in a wonderful performance. Harrelson almost steals the show, Eisenburg is the perfect 'loner/nerd', and Stone/Breslin make their characters come to life as well. A longer-than-usual 'cameo' from Bill Murray is also a highlight.Thus, even though I usually despise zombie-related fare, this one held my interest all the way through. I could have even watched more material, as it was so funny and fresh.",7,2,3,5 March 2017
It's a Wonderful Life," Can One Even Imagine A Time Without This Movie?
","One of the hallmarks of a truly classic film is its ability to make the viewer wonder, partially in exclamation but also partly in all seriousness, 'what was the world like before this experience?!'. 'It's A Wonderful Life' provides that exact emotion, as perhaps no movie in the history of cinema has concocted a better mixture of acting, emotional, seasonal relevance, and a story that will reach into the very depths of your soul.For a basic plot summary, 'Wonderful Life' tells the story of George Bailey (James Stewart), a simple man from a simple town (Bedford Falls) who desperately wants to escape his father's 'Building & Loan' business and travel the world. Every time he is about to take that 'next step', however, George (through both external and internal devices) remains in Bedford Falls managing the family business. Along the way, he marries childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed), morally classes with iron-clad town business baron Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), and eventually ends up building a life in the very place he once so desperately wanted to escape from. On Christmas Eve, however, George is dealt a horrific blow and is on the verge of ending his own life until he discovers he has a guardian angel looking out for him, showing him what a sad place a George Bailey-less world would be.The main reason this movie works so well is because we all have a little bit of George Bailey in us. That is why the poignant moments of this film capture our deepest emotions and promote serious life-reflection...because we know how easily each one of us could be (or even are) living out the actions of Mr. Bailey on a daily basis.This incredible plot is then bolstered by the perfect casting choice of 'everyman' Jimmy Stewart to play the lead. Because Mr. Stewart is an actor that we can all relate to, due to his spot-on portrayal of real human emotions, we can not only 'think' the plot, but also 'live' it vicariously through Stewart. The other cast members (especially Barrymore as the nefarious Potter) are brilliant as well, with each knowing just how to coax the right amount of emotion out of his/her role.In short, 'It's A Wonderful Life' is easily one of the greatest motion pictures ever constructed. It is completely genre-diverse, can be enjoyed by the entire family, and will thoroughly entertain you while also prompting some pretty deep introspection. If for some reason you haven't seen this gem, you have made a terrible mistake (!).",10,1,2,6 March 2017
A Beautiful Mind," Ron Howard's Masterpiece
","Director Ron Howard has had his name attached to some pretty prestigious projects over the years, such as 'Apollo 13', 'Cinderella Man', and 'The Da Vinci Code', to name but a few. 'A Beautiful Mind', however, is (pound-for-pound) probably the best Howard-directed movie of the lot.For a basic plot summary, this film looks at the life of John Nash (Russell Crowe), a brilliant (but quite eccentric) mathematician who is approached by shadowy government figure Parcher (Ed Harris) to work as a code-breaker to help expose a Soviet Union bomb plot. As Nash becomes obsessed with his work, wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) begins to wonder whether or not John is truly 'working' at all. To say any more would completely ruin the plot.I could write an essay on why this movie is so great, but to do so would give away key plot details that would ruin the experience for you. Suffice it to say, though, that there are plot twists that you won't see coming even if you know that some are coming! Plus, thanks to the direction of Ron Howard, this is the kind of movie that really isn't even about the 'twist'. It is more about the extraordinary life of Mr. Nash.The acting in 'A Beautiful Mind' is also top-notch. As I've said in other reviews of movies starring Crowe, I cannot recall him EVER turning in a bad performance on screen. I mean, the same guy who can play a Gladiator in one movie and and boxer in another ('Cinderella Man') can almost effortlessly (although I'm sure it isn't) transform himself into a much more cerebral role here. Co- stars Connelly and Harris play nice supporting roles as well, especially Connelly as Nash's wife who quite literally cannot believe what she is seeing from her husband on occasion.Thus, I consider 'A Beautiful Mind' to rank among my personal favorites. It has an intriguing plot, yet focuses heavily on the characters to make you really feel for them. Not only does in continue the 'Russell Crowe streak of perfection', but it also cements Howard as a top-notch director.",9,1,1,4 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Slowly But Surely The Details Unravel
","The first Harry Potter film, 'Sorcerer's Stone', set the groundwork for the wizarding universe and the Potter characters. This second film, 'Chamber of Secrets', slowly continues to unravel the narrative (with a lot of hi-jinx thrown in as well).For a basic plot summary, 'Chamber of Secrets' begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) being warned by Dobby (a house elf) not to return to Hogwarts for his second year. Not heeding the warnings, Harry does indeed return to his wizarding school and reunites with friends Hermoine (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint). Not long into the year, however, Harry and co. discover that a secret chamber does indeed exist in the bowels of Hogwarts, housing a monster hungry for the non-wizard blood of the young Hogwart-ians.The positives of this movie are that (with a few exceptions) it remains very faithful to the novel. It also is still a visual treat and contains some interesting special effects. The entire first half of the film contains a lot of what I would call 'hi-jinx' (or adventurous material), which lends itself to a lot of fantastic visuals based on the crazy characters imagined in the novel.Another interesting little track to follow in these films is that the main actors continue to improve on their performances as they age. Radcliffe, Watson, & Grint were all quite young when the series began, so to see them mature as actors on the big screen is a treat. Of course, the auxiliary cast is tremendous again, with Kenneth Branagh (as Professor Lockhart) particularly engaging.The only reason I give this film four stars compared to the original's five is that I'm still waiting for the narrative to shift into high gear. I'm probably not being all that objective here. but the primary plots so far have been very conducive to the age of the main protagonists. As the characters age, however, I have been told that the stories mature a bit and really begin to take off.Do not be alarmed, however, as this is still a great, entertaining film.",7,1,1,4 March 2017
Psycho," Very Different From The Rest Of The Hitch Collection
","There is no debating that 'Psycho' is one of the classic psychological thriller movies of all-time. Heck, some might say that it even invented the genre! What is perhaps even more interesting, however, is how different this film is from the rest of the Alfred Hitchcock collection of motion pictures.For a basic plot summary, 'Psycho' sees young secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steal a large sum of money from her employer in order to have an affair. While escaping the city in the dead of night, Crane pulls into the Bates Motel, owned and run by one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), when the weather takes a turn for the worse. What Marion, as well as a private investigator (Martin Balsam) and Lila Crane (Vera Miles) later one, discovers is that Norman is hiding a deep and terrible secret revolving around his beloved 'mother'.In most other Hitchcock movies, the plots are more generic and the picture full of color. In short, they are lighter experiences that as much showcase the stars and styles of the time as they do cultivate rich plots and intriguing characters. With 'Psycho', however, the entire experience is gritty and filled with some of the most interesting characters (in particular Perkins' Bates) ever to grace the big screen. The movie was even purposely filmed in black and white to give it that extra 'edge'.When a film like 'Psycho' achieves such a high degree of popularity, it sometimes loses a bit of its edge due to the fact that ever scene, character, and line has been dissected a thousand times over. In this case, though, 'Psycho' can be watched at fairly regular intervals without getting too stale. Even if you know what is coming (and most people by now do), it is still creepy.In short, 'Psycho' is a seminal film of American cinema for its character studies and raw thematic material (when its contemporaries, generally speaking, were much lighter and sometimes little more than vehicles for their stars). Whether the first time or the twenty-first time watching this gem, you will pick out 'just one more thing' that amazes you, as well as experience that 'creepy-crawly' feeling regarding Mr. Norman Bates.",10,1,2,8 March 2017
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Not A Let-Down
","After the rousing, somewhat unpredictable success of the first 'Transformers' film, Michael Bay and Co. set out to capture that winning formula once again in 'Revenge of the Fallen'. Despite much critical panning and even outright derision, I cannot understand why this would be consider a let-down in any way, shape, or form.For a basic plot summary, 'Transformers 2' sees Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) entering college and leaving girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind. When the Decepticons cook up another evil plan to destroy Earth, though, it isn't too long before Sam and Mikaela are once again teaming up with the Auto-Bots (as well as the U.S. military) to once again save the world.Simply put, this is the classic cinema case of 'same concepts, different packaging'. The amounts of humor, pulse-pounding action, and plot (or lack thereof) are pretty much the same as the original, but director Michael Bay is able to keep the proceedings remarkably fresh. Never once did I feel as if things were becoming 'old hat'.The key to enjoying this franchise (and even more so this film in particular) is this: have the ability to not take it seriously. If you view these movies as strictly 'escapism' entertainment, they will entertain you thoroughly. Do they hold up to dissection? Heck no. But that isn't the point.As usual, LaBeouf pretty much steals every scene he is in as the young Witwicky. He has the type of acting talent that perfectly meshed with the numerous 'just passed adolescence' characters he played during this time period, and this makes Sam very relatable to the audience.Overall, I enjoyed 'Revenge of the Fallen' nearly as much as its predecessor. While the 'newness' factor may have worn off a bit, this second effort (if viewed in the proper light) repackages the key elements of part one and lets us enjoy them again. Despite all the negative publicity about this one, the Transformers fan who can fully immerse him/her self into the experience (without too much 'thinking') CAN still have a blast watching this one.",8,3,4,8 March 2017
The Witch," Sometimes The Best Horror Is Subtle
","While being touted as a 'horror flick', 'The Witch' only shares that designation in the sense that the events depicted within it can be quite unsettling. It is nowhere near, however, the type of movie that most theater-goers these days would consider 'horror'. It has nothing in common with, say, 'Paranormal Activity', which uses jump-scares to produce its frights. No, 'The Witch' is a much more subtle type of scary, the type that unspools with each minute as you begin to gain a deeper understanding of how colonial Americans dealt with such terror.For a basic plot summary, 'The Witch' tells the story of a family in 1630s New England. Father William (Ralph Ineson) has a major falling-out with the religious community in his village, forcing him to be excommunicated and banished to the wilderness lands where he must begin a new life with wife Katherine (Kate Dickie), prepubescent daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy), well- meaning son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw), as well as the young twins Mercy (Ellie Grainger) and Jonas (Lucas Dawson). There is also an infant boy in tow, who quickly disappears near the edge of the forest. The family suspects witchcraft, but is there really paranormal activity afoot? Also, suspicions are raised that perhaps Thomasin herself knows more than she is letting on.There are many deep and interesting themes in 'The Witch', which automatically make it quite a bit more sophisticated than most stock horror fare these days. One major theme is how big of a role religion plays in the life of the family. Despite (or perhaps because of?) their devout Christianity, the mother and father are quick to pin the blame on such a nebulous concept as witchcraft. In today's society, where religion is often more of a 'commodity' to be used when needed, it is a very interesting history lesson, of sorts, to see how religion used to be a major part of every activity in a family's day-to-day life.Another interesting theme centers on familial relationships. The mother and father are constantly at odds about how to live their lives, especially with Thomasin just coming into her womanhood and brother Caleb's not-so-subtle noticing of that very fact. Even the little twins, who seem as innocent as can be, manage to rile up a family goat (named 'Black Phillip') and are quick to point fingers (as children are wont to do) at a sibling's transgressions. It's a potent family mix that only becomes more combustible when the overriding religious concepts are thrown into the fray.Perhaps the strongest suit of 'The Witch', however, is its simmering and building of tension. It's almost like a throwback to the Alfred Hitchcock style of directing, where the suspense is given more screen time than the 'big reveal'. Whereas horror fans are used to being jump-scared out of their seats, 'The Witch' again and again takes you just to the point of terror and then backs off. It really is masterful directing from Robert Eggers.Now, I won't get too spoiler-ish here, but the ending of the film is going to rub people the wrong way. What I will say, though, is that a key to understanding this movie is to realize that it was constructed from the actual journals, writings, and other documents of New Englanders from that time period. It tries to be as authentic as possible in that vein, which obviously makes it difficult to construct a narrative around which contemporary audiences will understand and appreciate. Eggers does the best he can in doing this, but this requires the ending to be more 'oblique' than 'final'. After some reflection and thought, I was okay with how it ended.So, I think that those two words--'reflection' & 'thought'--really are the key to appreciating 'The Witch'. If you are expecting one of those movies where every few minutes the tension builds and something jumps out, you'll likely leave disappointed. Instead, in typical A24 production company fashion, the real horror of 'The Witch' probably comes as much after you leave the theater and begin to process what you just saw. The combination of fanatical religion, 1600s family dynamics, and the ever-potential presence of the supernatural will give you plenty to think about for days afterward.",10,1,3,25 February 2017
Rosemary's Baby," A Creepy Thriller For The Ages
","All too many times, movies that fancy themselves 'thrillers' are really nothing of the sort. They are either too gory or too short (e.g. not well thought-out) to be regarding as true classics. In the case of 'Rosemary's Baby', however, director Roman Polanski crafts an epic tale that will forever stand the test of time.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and husband Guy (John Cassavetes), a young couple moving into a new apartment complex. They quickly make the acquaintance of older neighbors Minnie (Ruth Gordon) and Roman (Sidney Blackmer) and seem to have forged a sort of friendship with them. When Rosemary becomes pregnant, however, she begins to expect that perhaps the friendliness of the neighbors has a sinister ulterior motive regarding a higher power at work.This movie is so creepy (and thus ultimately such a classic) because it is so understated. The characters of Rosemary and Guy are so true-to-life in their portrayal of young, married life that the viewer cannot help but identify with them. In short, we see ourselves in them, which makes us root for (or against) the events surrounding them that much more. There is no blood or guts in this one, but rather just an atmosphere of tension that continues to build and build as the minutes tick by.Granted, however, that this is not a film for youngsters by any means. It is very adult-themed and contains material that may truly haunt younger-than-adolescent minds. That is part of the reason why the film stands up so well, though, as it contains none of the childish 'slasher/gore' mentality of most horror flicks.Finally, 'Rosemary's Baby' can also (from today's perspective) be viewed as a nice period piece. I believe Polanski must have suspected it would be looked at as such too, as many pop culture references are strategically placed throughout the flick.Overall, this is one of the classic suspense/thriller pictures of all-time. The plot of the film (which I won't divulge here) is almost a bit clichéd now due to overuse, but this original is still as striking as I'm sure it was in the 1960s. If you like those 'uncomfortable' movie experiences that might have you sleeping with a night-light for a night or two, 'Rosemary's Baby' is for you.",9,2,4,6 March 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," Gritty Filmmaking At Its Finest (But Needed That 'Human Touch' To Truly Be Great)
","For what it is, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a solid recap of the events that ultimately led to the death of Osama Bin Laden. However, the story is told in such a clinical tone that it fails to be a true classic.For a basic plot summary, this movie begins shortly after 9/11, when Maya (Jessica Chastain), a government agent, is put on the Bin Laden hunt. After briefly teaming with interrogator Dan (Jason Clarke), Maya branches out on her own and begins an almost decade-long hunt for the mastermind behind the 9/11 attacks. The movie culminates with the raid on the compound in which Bin Laden was hiding.There are indeed many 'positive' experiences to take from this movie. It isn't over-the-top, which can always be a bit of a concern when dealing with such 'real' topics, and I believe it strives to portray the events as close as possible to how they actually occurred. As such, there are controversial scenes of torture, as well as an incredibly suspense final campaign to root out Bin Laden from his fortress-like compound. It is just a very gritty film very similar to director Kathryn Bigelow's earlier work 'The Hurt Locker'.However, this film is severely missing the 'human touch' that any film needs in order to truly be great. This is a very clinical, stoic re-telling of the hunt for Bin Laden, almost completely devoid of any derived dramatic component. While, like I said earlier, this is usually a positive trait in films, this time I believe it was taken a bit too far. In order for me to truly rank a film at the top of the heap, I need to be able to emotionally identify with the characters and their circumstances. In this case, that just didn't happen, and as such I dock it one star.Overall, though, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is a taut, intense tale of great historical significance. Though missing some key emotional components, I have to give credit to Bigelow for tackling such tough issues and still managing to produce a viable film that isn't hackneyed or pandering to politics.",7,1,2,8 March 2017
Steve Jobs," Incredible Personality Treatise Of A Complex Individual
","A number of years ago, I watched 'The Social Network' and was completely transfixed. I loved how that movie was able to tell a specific story (the origins of Facebook) and also serve as an excellent character study. When I heard that the same screenwriter (Aaron Sorkin) that did 'Social Network' was on this project, I was obviously intrigued. The result is a movie just as good at examining real life events through the prism of drama and time (or hindsight). Perhaps even better, in certain ways, as it had less historical material to focus on and thus was truly about the man at its center.For a basic plot summary, 'Steve Jobs' tells the story of its title character (played by Michale Fassbender) through three different product launches at three distinct times in his life. In each instance, Jobs verbally spars with personal assistant Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet) and must deal with a family situation involving a child who he doesn't want to accept is his (Makenzie Moss, Ripley Sobo, & Perla Haney-Jardine) and an estranged wife (Katherine Waterston) who wants little to do with him but is sure glad to accept his bank deposits. Also explored are Jobs' relationships with fellow tech gurus such as Steve Wozniak (Seth Rogan), John Sculley (Jeff Daniels), and Andy Hertzfield (Michael Stuhlbarg).As we all know, the real-life Steve Jobs was a very complicated, unique, and even polarizing figure (the guy once got kicked out of his own company, for crying out loud!). There is no doubt that he was quite a revolutionary thinker...yet pretty much everyone who worked for the man intimates that he was a class-A jerk with a slave-driver mentality. That is the main focus of this film, and it provides some of the movie's best moments. The film-makers really tackle the question of 'did Jobs have to be such a jerk in order to do what he did?'. That is fascinating discussion topic, and one that Sorkin and director Danny Boyle cut to the heart of with 'Steve Jobs'.This is very much a 'talking film', so if you are looking for a lot of action, you might have to temper expectations. To be honest, this is almost a completely dialogue-driven film. Fortunately, Sorkin has mastered the art of dialogue and uses it to full advantage here. There isn't a wasted scene, with every conversation a chance to dig a little deeper into the heart of Jobs the business man, Jobs the family man, and Jobs the individual. Though difficult to do right (as dialogue- heavy films can be disasters if not handled with a sense of energy), I'm a huge fan of this style of film-making. I know that 'show, not tell' is usually the mantra of Hollywood, but when dealing with personalities I think that can be deviated from a bit.To pull off all that dialogue, there needs to be great actors up on the screen, and 'Steve Jobs' has that all-around. Fassbender is entrancing as Jobs, while the entire supporting cast is also excellent. Especially on-point is Rogen as Wozniak. His scenes with Fassbender are probably the best of the entire film, cutting to the heart of who Jobs was as an individual.This movie opened to bad press and made little money (at least initially), and I think I know why: you can't go in expecting a cradle-to-grave biography. That's not what this movie sets out to do. It is a character study, plain and simple, just like 'The Social Network' was really as much a character study of Mark Zuckerberg as it was a 'movie about Facebook'. 'Steve Jobs' leans even more in that direction, as there is no 'one specific event' that it can lean on. Instead, each behind-the-scenes of the product launch is intended to give glimpses into how Jobs handles different portions of his life in order to get to know him better. Obviously, some of the key details are filled in through monologues and flashbacks, but this is by now means anywhere near a comprehensive biography. That wasn't the point.Overall, I consider 'Steve Jobs' to be one of the most thought-provoking films I've seen at the cinema in quite some time. It can play to the nostalgia of Apple users, tech nostalgia in general, and tell a complex personality tale about one of the great technology icons of all-time. The themes espoused in the film will be kicking around in your noggin long after the lights cycle up and the credits roll.",10,5,9,27 February 2017
Sausage Party," Sounds Exaggerated, But Maybe The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen
","When I saw 'Knocked Up' in 2007, I became a fan of 'Seth Rogan humor', as I consider that film to be hilarious. Ever since then, I've usually had an ear or eye open when one of his projects comes down the pike. It was that thought process that got me into the theater for 'Sausage Party'...and experience that I sincerely wish I could take back. While perhaps not the worst movie I've EVER seen (but...maybe), it is easily the worst I've ever reviewed here on Amazon.For a basic plot summary, 'Sausage Party' begins like 'Toy Story in the grocery store', with all the different foods wanting to be 'chosen' by beings (humans) they believe to be Gods. Frank the hot dog (Rogan) and Brenda the bun (Kristen Wiig) want to be chosen together (for obvious reasons) and that seems to be exactly what happens...until the plan goes awry and they become separated, having to decipher the mystery of 'the great beyond' for themselves.I could spend oh so much time painstakingly going over why 'Sausage Party' is truly an abomination, but I'll boil it down here to three main areas:1. It's wildly offensive, both in language and tone. I'm not terribly sensitive to the f-bomb being dropped in movies, but when it happens every couple words it is clearly just lazy dialogue. The whole 'we don't have anything really interesting to say, so let's just curse a lot' sort of mentality. It is also one of the raunchiest films (in terms of content) that I have ever seen. Again, I'm no prude, but every single joke is of the most crass or sexual nature possible. 2. The whole thing wants to work as a critique of organized religion, but it falls flat (again, I think, because the crudity and profanity overshadow everything else). 3. The plot is completely and utterly pointless. It is mainly just these animated characters wandering around and finding themselves in bizarre and gross situations.Put it this way...as a person who thoroughly enjoys quality cinema, I am able to find not an ounce of redeeming value in this movie. Call me a snob if you will, but I enjoy shows like 'Family Guy' and other low-brow pursuits. 'Sausage Party', however, is what happens when you let Seth Rogan take 'stoner humor' to its maximum (and then beyond).With the possible exception of 'Dumb and Dumber 2', this is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in the past 2-3 years. Maybe I've seen worse in my lifetime...but maybe I haven't, either.",1,4,9,26 February 2017
Joker," A Decent Joker Take, But Not The One I Prefer
","After seeing the credits roll on 'Joker', it took me a bit to figure out my exact feelings towards it. On one hand, there is nothing inherently bad about the film, and it certainly is a new/fresh way to examine that character's backstory mythos. On the other hand, however, there is also a thought that nagged me which said that something was a bit 'off' about the whole thing. The conclusion I've come to is that while 'Joker' is a legitimate take on his origins, it just isn't the #1 (or even #2) take that I prefer.For a basic overview, this film focuses on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), an aspiring stand-up comedian who works as an entertaining clown to support himself. Arthur clearly also has some some of mental illness, including the propensity for laughter when the emotional situation does not call for it. The combination of all these factors sees Fleck mistreated or put down by society at nearly every step of his Gotham-dwelling existence. After perpetuating a subway murder and then being embarrassed on live television by Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), the late-night talk show host he idolizes, Fleck transforms himself into the tragically comedic figure Batman fans know well.I actually have more respect than most, I think, towards the validity of this 'take' on The Joker. It is easily the most gritty and true-to-life that has ever been attempted at this point. Basically, WB and director Todd Phillips are saying 'here is how a real-life Joker figure could spring up', right down to explaining the makeup and predilection towards uncontrollable laughter. In and of itself, there really isn't anything 'wrong' with this take.That being said, I still prefer Ledger's mysterious Joker of 'The Dark Knight' or even Nicholson's mob-leader Joker of 'Batman (1989)'. Acting performances strictly aside for the moment, I just don't know about--and feel a little uncomfortable with--the Joker being a tragic figure. I prefer the comic-book approach of Nicholson falling into the vat of chemicals, or the air of mystery surrounding where exactly Ledger's Joker came from. Having this Phoenix Joker spring from a place of potential sympathy? However legitimate that take may be, I just don't like it as much.There are also a few frustrating choices that hold back the overall story of the film:
-A subplot involving Arthur's neighbor down the hall (played by Zazie Beetz) goes absolutely nowhere and ends up meaning very little.
-The shoehorning of the Wayne family into the movie. Did we really need to see the Waynes murder again?! That's becoming a parody of itself at this point. Plus, scenes that feature Fleck and any member of the Wayne family feel like pandering to the Batman crowd rather. The cherry on top, of course, is the insinuation (true or false) that Fleck may actually be a Wayne family relation. Again, that's taking the 'easy way out' when it comes to crafting this story.Fortunately, 'Joker' does enough things right to make it watchable. It isn't boring by any means, the music and overall production value is great, and Phoenix does give a great performance. For the tone of the character that Phillips is trying to create, Phoenix is marvelous, actually.Overall, though, I only moderately enjoyed this take on the Joker mythos. Maybe, had this been the first attempt at doing so, I'd feel differently. But as it stands, it comes down to me liking other interpretations of the character more than this one.",6,5,13,14 October 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," True To Its Source, While Also Adding Some Iconic Canon
","When judging a film based on a spectacularly popular novel, there are two things that I usually look for: 1. Does it stick to the compelling themes of the source material reasonably well? I don't need word-for-word and I don't even mind little changes here and there, but it should be faithful to the themes that made the literature iconic. 2. Does it add something unique to the equation? Print literature and film are too entirely different beasts to tame (just ask Stephen King about that!), and one doesn't necessarily (or even usually) translate well into the other. In essence, you can't just expect a movie to be successful because the book was likewise. The film-makers need to make sure the translation is fit for the big screen.On both of those counts, 'To Kill A Mockingbird' receives a solid 'A' grade.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on a number of events transpiring in the small community of Maycomb, GA during the 1930s. Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), a lawyer, is called upon to defend a Negro man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters) over allegations of rape from white woman Mayella Ewell (Collin Wilcox) and her father (James Anderson). While this race-fueled trial grips Maycomb, the children of Atticus have their own coming-of-age adventures. Jean- Louise, or 'Scout' (Mary Badham) and Jem (Phillip Alford) make a new friend in out-of-towner Dill (John Megna), obsess over the neighborhood legend of Arthur 'Boo' Radley, and try (as best they can) to come to terms with their father's work.In terms of capturing the iconic themes of the novel, this film is able to accomplish that heady task, of which much credit can be given to director Robert Mulligan. In terms of getting the 'gist' of the story, I could recommend either the book OR the novel (though I would highly recommended both!) and feel confident the message would come across in either format. It is also a film that can be enjoyed by children and adults in equal measure. Children will feel akin to young Scout, while adults will be taken in by the solemn themes interspersed with recollections of more 'innocent' (or were they) and youthful days.What makes 'To Kill A Mockingbird' truly special, though, is that Peck's Atticus Finch is easily one of the most iconic film characters of all time. I can't imagine reading the novel now and not picturing him as Atticus. He's the father figure of all big-screen father figures. While Atticus was a powerfully-written character even in the novel, one could argue that Peck even transcends that literature and brings more depth to the character. The courtroom scenes featuring Atticus in this movie are truly riveting no matter how many times you see them.Thus, I have to consider 'To Kill A Mockingbird' to be one of my favorite all-time films. Even having seen it and read the book a number of times, it can still bring a tear to my eye and stir some pretty deep emotions. Both film and book complement each other perfectly.",9,2,3,28 February 2017
Man on Fire," A Story Of Redemption
","In Hollywood, 'redemption' is a character arc that plays very well in the cinemas. One would be hard-pressed to create a more intense, emotional story of redemption than what can be found in 'Man on Fire'.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on the character of Creasy (Denzel Washington), an alcoholic with a troubled, violent past. After visiting old buddy Rayburn (Christopher Walken), Creasy gets hooked up as a bodyguard for a family in Mexico City. While at first quite distant, Creasy eventually lets down his stern persona for a bit and forms a relationship with the little girl he is supposed to be protecting, Pita (Dakota Fanning).If you have seen the movie 'Taken', then you already have a rough idea of how the plot line goes. Yet, under the direction of Tony Scott, 'Man On Fire' is actually a better, more intense/emotional film due to its gritty undertones. This is a movie that does not pull any punches, so to speak, when it comes to portraying the kidnappings that so often occur in the big cities of Mexico. It is just a very emotional topic and is nailed so perfectly by Scott.Of course, the hallmark of this film is its acting from Washington and Fanning. I would argue that Denzel gives his greatest performance EVER, while Fanning (as usual) shows acting talent light- years beyond her age. The way those two characters interact with each other truly carry the emotional burden of the movie and provide the reason to 'care' about what is going on. Plus, in typical fashion, the fiery side of Washington's acting persona is able to be revealed on more than one occasion.Thus, I consider 'Man on Fire' to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is equal parts intense and emotional, and great acting performances abound. It is still difficult for me to believe that this flick was not nominated for any major awards (perhaps the graphic violence had something to do with it), because it would have been very much deserved in the acting, direction, and adapted screenplay categories.",9,3,4,4 March 2017
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," One Of The Most Intriguing Characters (And Plot lines) You'll Ever Watch
","Far too often, movie-goers of the current generation dismiss films from the 1970s as 'too old'. You see, the film might not be spotless, the fashions may be out of date, and no computer- animation is in sight. Fortunately, films like 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Next' exist to show that some themes are relevant in ANY era.The basic plot of 'Cuckoo' centers on R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a troublemaker who is being 'evaluated' by a mental institution because, frankly, the law doesn't know what to do with him anymore. During this trial period, however, McMurphy (clearly no crazier than the lot of us) begins to 'stir up' the other 'patients' by trying to get them to stand up against the domineering Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and showing them that a real life doesn't have to include pills, wanderings, and white uniforms (especially when he finds that most of them are 'voluntary' anyway!). Unfortunately, for McMurphy's sake, this 'rash' behavior sends a ripple effect through the entire facility that ends up in disastrous effects for him.Having a wee bit of experience in the mental-evaluation field, I can say that the issues presented in this film are still being hashed out on the 'battlefields' of such facilities to this very day. What is 'crazy'? How can one detect it? Is it possible to fight against institutions of the state? Upon finishing the viewing experience, those questions (among many others) will float around in our head long after the TV is turned off.The incredible acting in the movie also increases the enjoyment factor exponentially. Nicholson is brilliant, as usual, while the cast of 'cooks' (including a very young Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito) are at times a riot, but also can be quite touching. Plus, Fletcher's Nurse Ratched (though never outwardly violent) is one of the creepiest, most hated characters in the history of cinema.Thus, if you have never seen this film, please go out and do so NOW! It may not be overtly flashy like the big-budget epics of today, but its message and acting will immediately rank it quite high on your 'favorite films' list. It deserved every Academy Award it won in 1975.",10,1,3,11 March 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Solid Science-Fiction
","For some reason, this film really didn't 'catch on' in its advertising stages. First billed as 'Edge of Tomorrow' and touted as an action shoot-em-up (I remember seeing the trailer in theaters), it then morphed into 'Live, Die, Repeat' and was re-branded as a time-travel escapade. Though the film deserved a more coherent approach to garner some box office success, its dual- personality is shown within the movie as well.For a basic plot summary, 'Edge of Tomorrow' sees Cage (Tom Cruise), a military man, sent to the front lines of combat against an alien threat against the planet. Almost immediately after parachuting into enemy territory, the entire mission goes awry and everyone dies. And then Cage wakes up at the beginning of that same day. With only a vague reference to female fighting hero Rita (Emily Blunt) to guide him, Cage must simultaneously find out what the heck is happening to him while also trying to win the battle for his country.'Edge of Tomorrow' is a solid movie. Cruise is great (as usual), the plot is mind-bending, and the action is top-notch. I was entertained throughout and never felt bored or confused.That isn't to say that this is an all-time classic. There is no context given for the alien invasion (which is very disappointing from a plot standpoint), and the ending (IMHO) leaves a bit to be desired. Also, I was very disappointed in Blunt's performance as the female lead. Her character is an integral part of the story, and it comes across as very weak and ultimately useless. I think that she was cast wrong for this role, as a more likable/approachable presence would have played much better to interact with Cruise's character. I know she is supposed to be 'tough', but that toughness doesn't end up meaning much if the character falls flat.Overall, 'Edge of Tomorrow' is a solid science fiction effort. It's very entertaining, but fails to truly be great because of a few major flaws. Like the advertising for the film, director Doug Liman doesn't quite seem to know exactly what he wants the picture to be. Very comparable to another Cruise sci-fi flick 'Oblivion'.",8,1,1,4 March 2017
Pitch Perfect 2," More Entertaining Than The First After Embracing Its Humor
","When I watched the original 'Pitch Perfect' a number of years ago, I was disappointed in an experience that I felt wasn't sure of itself. That movie struggled to figure out whether to be grounded in semi-serious character development or fully embrace the comedy. In this sequel, however, they choose to fully embrace the comedy, and at least for me that was a decision that led to more entertaining experience.For a basic plot summary, 'Pitch Perfect 2' sees a return of the Borden Bellas...but only until they make themselves a national embarrassment after some 'exposure' from Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Now, with the program about to be put on academic probation, it begins to fracture from within. Beca (Anna Kendrick) is spending just as much time on her own music career, while the routines just don't seem to be coming together like they used to. It takes freshman newcomer Emily (Hailee Steinfeld) to rally the troops and compete in the seemingly unwinnable 'Worlds' competition featuring the dominant German squad.Even though I am nowhere near the target audience of this movie (30 year-old male), I found this one to be a pretty entertaining experience because of its willingness to embrace its own silly humor throughout. Instead of trying to ground this movie in any sense of reality, it goes all-out for the jokes and music and I think it fits the style of director Elizabeth Banks better. Once you think of it as a pure comedy, it makes it a lot easier to get through.Another great addition to the franchise was the Steinfeldt character, who breathes some new life and youthful exuberance into all proceedings. Without the new perspective given by her character, this could have been a pretty large repeat of the original. Steinfeldt can sing and act with equal measure (and both at a very high level), and is set up perfectly to be the star of subsequent sequels should Kendrick tire of the mantle.Overall, 'Pitch Perfect 2' was more fun for me than the original. It doesn't try to sell itself as anything other than a comedy, the songs are catchy and fun (as usual), and the Steinfeld performance is mesmerizing. This genre will never be my favorite, but it didn't struggle to finish this film like I did the first one.",6,1,1,28 February 2017
It Chapter Two," Doesn't Get The Adults Right (Or The Ending In General)
","The first part of this 'It' mini-franchise had something. It may not have been a perfect film by any means, but it did utilize a great cast of child actors and achieve a sort of cultural-zeitgeist 'Stranger Things'-esque appeal. When it comes time to bring in the adults and execute the ending of Stephen King's iconic story, however, 'Chapter Two' fails miserably in a number of key areas.For a basic overview, 'It Chapter Two' sees the Loser's Club reunited in Derry 27 years after It was presumed dead. Mike Hanlon (Isaiah Mustafa), now the town librarian, has called them all back because the evil Pennywise (Bill Skarsgard) has sprung upon Derry once again. So, Bill (James McAvoy), Richie (Bill Hader), Eddie (James Ransone), Ben (Jay Ryan), and Beverly (Jessica Chastain) return to their childhood abode to try and finish It off this time around.There are three major problems with this second part that make it a pretty abject failure...First and foremost, director Andy Muschietti (and presumably writer Gary Dauberman) do not grasp why, as audience members, we should care about the adult Losers. It's easy to root for a group of young kids chumming around together and then trying to stop a ferocious evil. The reason we care about the adults, however, is because 27 years later they are each dealing with relatable 'adult problems' (abuse, addiction, job failure, etc.). King expertly captures this in the novel, whereas this film pays it lip service (and even paltry lip service at that). Here, the only reason we are given to care about the Losers is that 'they were once kids'. It is very telling that the best parts of 'Chapter 2' is when it flashes back to the 'kid scenes'.Secondly, the scenes involving the adult Losers having their own 'voyage of discovery' just don't make any sense. It was almost more of an excuse to create hideous CGI monsters than it served the plot whatsoever. For example, Bev's meeting with an old woman living in her apartment was legitimately creepy...until it turns into a giant hulking monster straight out of a fantasy piece. In these moments, the filmmakers seemed to forget that 'It's' horror is as much psychological as visceral.Finally, the ending is severely disappointing for fans (like myself) of the King novel. Not focusing on spouses robs the movie of the books' incredible coda, while the final battle with Pennywise/It is almost laughable. To even call it an adaptation of the book's ending is a stretch. While I realize that some of the narrative 'punch' would always be taken away by splitting the story into the 'kid half' and 'adult half', even then this ending doesn't elicit even the slightest emotion or any sense of gravitas.It seems like what may have happened over the course of these two movies is that the filmmakers were so focused on the mechanics of adapting King's brilliant (yet rather unwieldy) story that they sort of lost track of the ideas behind what made it all work in the first place. This wasn't on display nearly as much in the first part, as that installment was just so much fun, but in this one that failure is as plain as day. Putting the kids in the 80s was a great narrative choice, but other than that almost all the other changes are for the worst.Perhaps the worst thing I can say about this big-budget production? If forced, I'd still have to call the 1990 TV miniseries 'It' adaptation my favorite. While that production certainly had warts of its own, it much more accurately captured both the physical and psychological horror of King's original intent. Besides some great child acting performances, this two-film duo doesn't accomplish either of those things.",3,2,3,3 November 2019
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," The Most Quotable Comedy Ever
","If the mark of a tremendous comedy is the ability to leave the audience quoting its funniest lines long after the end credits roll, than 'Anchorman' is one of the greatest comedic masterpieces ever produced.For a basic plot summary, 'Anchorman' is set in the 1970s TV news business, where anchormen rule the roost and women are not given the time of day. As such, legendary anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) feels threatened when female reporter Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) doesn't back down under his comic machismo.'Anchorman' is a typical Will Ferrell move through and through. That is, the humor comes from watching Ferrell recite the most hilarious of lines with the straightest of faces. Almost every joke is completely ridiculous, but the fact that everyone plays it so straight is where the real humor arises.Also, Steve Carrell (and to a lesser extent other auxiliary cast members David Koechner & Paul Rudd, among others) nearly steals the show playing the 'sidekick' role. In one of Carrell's first film roles, he shows that his type of humor (in the same vein of Ferrell) would be around to stay. 'Brick Tamland' provides easily some of the most side-splitting material ever put to film.Overall, I consider 'Anchorman' to be one of the funniest comedy films of all-time for one basic reason: it isn't a complete farce. There are no intensely sexual, bodily secretion, or otherwise gross-out jokes in this film. Just well thought-out and well-acted humor for the duration.",10,1,2,11 March 2017
American Gangster," A Great (True) Story, But Falls A Bit Flat On Film
","If one were to focus strictly on plot/story when evaluating this film, it would easily receive five stars. Whether it be the U.S. military flying drugs out of Asia, the corruption of U.S. cops, or the almost surreal life of mobster Frank Lucas, all those real-life accounts are riveting, making one question how such things could possibly happen in our great country.Yet, as portrayed in this film, those stories became quite overextended or overblown, as a result making this film seem like a documentary instead of real life-inspired drama. True, I did watch the Extended Edition, but I am confident that the 18-minute less Theatrical Edition would have improved things only slightly. The film moves along at a snails pace, which while probably necessary in order to portray all the complex emotions of the movie, still may make the viewer feel as though this is a marathon viewing.Also, the acting in this film is pretty toned down as well. I'm not sure if this was because that was just what the real-life people were like, but either way it was underwhelming. The cool, intense Denzel Washington only comes out in glimpses, which is a shame in a movie that features so much of him. Only Russell Crowe's character shows great character development, and even that is not up to the standards of most dramas.To conclude, then, this film was likely the best it possibly could have been...but still doesn't translate into compelling drama. The complex drug storyline is very interesting, but the movie's extremely long run time and mellow acting will often make you feel as if you have been watching forever.",5,1,3,12 March 2017
The Green Mile," One Of The Best Book-To-Film Translations I Have Ever Seen
","A few weeks ago, I finished Stephen King's novel 'The Green Mile' and realized that I was about the only person on the planet who had not seen the film adaptation. Upon viewing the 3-hour piece of work, I was amazed by the degree to which King's writing was able to be translated to the big screen (as opposed to, say, 'Hearts In Atlantis', which left much to be desired).The plot of the film is exactly the same as that of the book, centering on a 1930s death row prison and the strange (paranormal?) events that transpired there. All the actors are dead-on in their interpretation of King's characters, such as the inspired Paul Edgecombe (Tom Hanks), the lunatic guard Percy Wetmore(Doug Hutchison), the even loony-er prisoner 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell), and the hulking, meek inmate John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), from which the story really draws from.I won't give away any plot details here, but suffice it to say that pretty much everyone will enjoy this film. While the subject matter and language (the film IS set in a prison) rules out the kiddies, pretty much anybody else should find it to be an inspiring journey, as the movie explores the themes of death, love, and doing the noble deed in the face of great opposition.I don't say this for many book-film combinations, but in this case you may actually be better off in seeing the film, as the acting is so wonderful and the plot does not deviate from the novel.",10,1,2,12 March 2017
Jaws," Practically Defined A Genre
","There are some films that no matter how much time passes after their debut, they still completely hold up. 'Jaws' is EXACTLY one of those films.For a basic plot summary, Jaws sees the coastal town of Amity suddenly becoming the hunting grounds for a rogue Great White shark. Sheriff Brody (Roy Schieder) wants to close down the beaches until further notice, but is opposed every step of the way by city official Vaughn (Murray Hamilton), who worries about the potential lose of tourist business. When the attacks continue, however, Brody enlists the help of shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled boatsman Quint (Robert Shaw) to help hunt down the predator.In terms of suspense, 'Jaws' may just take the cake for the top prize all-time in the genre. Its theme music is now iconic, the visuals were groundbreaking for their time, and just the overall feel of the whole picture has a creepy vibe to it. Even if you have watched the movie 'a thousand times', you'll still find yourself sucked into the drama. Only helping matters is the fact that the shark scenes, though filmed completely devoid of the helpful CGI tactics of today, do not look/feel cheesy in any way. A remarkable piece of filmmaking, for sure.Of course, a movie like this needs more than just a 'villain shark' to be a classic. It also features a collection of iconic characters that still remain a joy to watch. Schieder as the 'why-won't- anyone-listen-to-me!' sheriff lets us relate to the story in a much more personal aspect, while Dreyfuss' Hooper is insightful, hilarious, and provides some of the best dialogue of the whole show. Of course, Shaw as Quint nearly steals the show at times with the complexity and jocularity he manages to portray in the single character.Very soon, 'Jaws' will turn 40. When it does (and continuing for the decades to come) it will remain just as visceral of an experience as for those sitting in the theaters in 1975. There is a reason why director Steven Spielberg was vaulted to fame after this effort!",10,2,3,6 March 2017
The Wrestler," Will Be Better If You Know Very Little About Wrestling
","Being an old-school fan of professional wrestling (I grew up in the WWF's late 1980s-early 90s heyday), I was expecting to thoroughly enjoy this much-hyped film. Instead, I found it to fall quite flat for me for two specific reasons:First, I think I came into viewing 'The Wrestler' with too much prior experience/knowledge of professional wrestling. While the film depicts such unsettling scenes as the locker room drug/steroid deals, the brutal 'death matches', and the lonely life that a pro wrestler leads, those were things I already knew, thus I wasn't shocked to see them on screen. Perhaps moviegoers who know nothing about the sinister side of pro wrestling would find those things more horrifying (and thus sympathize with Mickey Rourke's 'Randy the Ram' character) than I did.Secondly, I just wasn't sucked into what was supposed to provide the drama of the film. Randy's relationship with his stripper girlfriend didn't quite lend itself to incredible drama, because it wasn't fleshed-out enough, while his relationship with his estranged daughter flourished a bit too quickly to make the climax of the film as touching as it could have been.So, although Rourke does turn in an inspired performance, I felt that the film was a bit too rushed in its dramatic efforts and didn't cover enough new territory (at least for me) to hold my interest. However, if you know very little about the backstage goings-on in professional wrestling, then this movie may shock you enough to truly care about Randy the Ram.",3,1,2,11 March 2017
Hancock," Could Have Been Better, But Still Quite Entertaining
","The basic premise of this film is a fascinating one that really has never been explored in mainstream films: what happens when a bona fide superhero ends up being more trouble than he is worth? This is exactly the case with Will Smith's Hancock, who (although saving lives) also wreaks tremendous damage to the city and is a dirty, stinking alcoholic. Thus, the 'hook' of this film involves Hancock trying to rehab his sullen, non-caring image after meeting a PR consultant on one of his 'rescue' missions.What works in this film is the theme of 'superhero gone bad'. Coming on the heels of 'The Dark Knight', which really toyed with the definitions of heroes and villains, 'Hancock' takes that theme to a whole new level, as he is a terrible person in every way besides the fact that he saves a few lives every once in awhile. Thus, the most entertaining portions of this film occur as Hancock tries to learn the delicate balance between being a role model and still being 'cool' at the same time. Early in the movie, Hancock's loneliness is so readily observed that one can believe he will try anything to gain some respect or friendships.On the other hand, I thought that the reveal of where Hancock is actually from was a bit lacking. The build-up to his origins are fantastic (as his scattered memories contribute mightily to his apathy towards being 'good'), but the reveal leaves much to be desired. In all honesty, I still don't exactly know what/who Hancock is with much certainty. More fleshing out of that angle of the storyline may have pushed this film to a five-star rating from me.Overall, Hancock is a very entertaining movie...and really, what more can you ask for?! Despite being a bit lacking in Hancock's character history, the film DOES provide some great action scenes, multiple moments of comedy, and an original storyline that will make you personally feel for the tormented 'superhero'.",7,1,2,12 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Rather Middling Ending To Middle Earth On The Big Screen
","As a fan of all things Middle Earth, I was pumped up to see the conclusion of the film forays into Tolkien's universe. I absolutely loved the LOTR trilogy, as well as the first two Hobbit installments. Though I did not like the decision to split the small-ish book into three long films, a selfish part of me was kind of glad that I would have three more opportunities to see this franchise in theaters. Unfortunately, 'Battle of the Five Armies' ran out of really good material to cover, and it showed.In this film, we see the dragon Smaug descending upon Lake-town in a fury, having discovered that his hoard of gold has been infiltrated by Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). Bard (Luke Evans), the protector of Lake-town, discovers the 'chink in Smaug's armor' and puts an end to the dragon's reign. With a pile of treasure now ripe for the taking, the Battle of the Five Armies begins, primarily egged on by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), who has a sort of 'dragon treasure fever' take hold of him.The main problem with this movie is that Tolkien's 'Battle of the Five Armies' isn't enough to make an entire movie out of. Going by the text itself, I believe it only constitutes about 50 or so pages! It seems as if director Peter Jackson got a little battle-happy, as posturing for battles and the battles themselves constitute a great portion of the film. Perhaps, however, that was almost required because of the trilogy of films (what else could you have the characters do?).I think what really got exposed here is that 'The Hobbit' isn't (and never was meant to be) a story about battles. The LOTR book trilogy is an epic, to be sure, but 'Hobbit' is much more of a children's tale, full of fun and frivolity. It has its serious, canon moments to be sure, but it is a very simple tale compared to LOTR. The first two Hobbit films actually do a really good job of re- creating that levity while still maintain an LOTR-esque sense of gravitas. In 'Five Armies', though, the subject material left over is all about posturing, speeches, and battles. What was meant (and rightly so) as a somewhat speedy (yet logical) completion of the book cannot sustain a two and a half hour film.There are subplots involving Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Tauriel (Evangeline Lily), and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), but I found that material to be quite lackluster as well. It tries to set up the events of 'Fellowship of the Ring' in a prequel-esque sort of way, but I never really felt that sense of 'oh, that's cool!' at all. Again, probably because such scenes are not in the Hobbit novel and thus don't feel quite right.All that being said, this isn't a terrible movie. Jackson still has his directing touch, the battles are visually impressive, and the music/atmosphere is always so distinctly Middle Earth that one cannot help but be transported into that universe, if you will. Howard Shore's incredible music helps too.Overall, though, after about 20 minutes into the film when Smaug breathes his last, it becomes unnecessarily (though necessary to sustain an entire third part) bloated and overplayed. It's too bad that one of the greatest book-to-film translations of all-time has to go out on just an 'okay' note.",5,4,5,4 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," It All Comes Together
","After the almost mythical success of the Original Trilogy, the first two movies of the Prequel Trilogy set the stage for a potentially explosive 'final chapter'. Well, 'Revenge of the Sith' delivers the goods in nearly every way imaginable.Put simply, 'Episode III' tells two concurrent stories: The turn of Annakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) into Darth Vader by Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), and the fall of the Jedi Republic to the Sith Empire.Without giving away any major spoilers, suffice it to say that the final hour of this movies easily matches (if not eclipses) anything that any other movie throws at viewers. There are so many 'OMG' moments left and right that the viewer is left in a relative stupor upon conclusion.I could go on and on, but I'll be brief: after watching all three of the prequels again in order to 'set the second straight' on their value, I was surprised at how much I enjoyed them. This is in large part due to the rousing 'finale' provided in this installment.On a final note, please watch these films on Blu Ray if at all possible. If any films in history were made for 1080p, the Star Wars efforts are atop the list.Thus, if you enjoyed Episodes I & II whatsoever, Episode III will astound you with its ability to give the Star Wars sage more emotional depth and resonance. I can say little wrong about 'Revenge of the Sith'.",9,2,2,11 March 2017
Inception," Great Concept, Decent Execution
","This film features one of the most innovative concepts of all-time, that of 'dreams within dreams' and similar fare. But is it a classic? Not quite, due to some 'can't quite put my finger on it' lack of overall execution.For a basic plot summary, 'Inception' deals in the world of shared dreams, in which individuals (while asleep) can enter the dream of another and insert/extract information. When an 'inception' team (led by Leonardo DiCaprio) is put together for an especially difficult assignment, they must go deeper into the mark's head than ever before.In terms of grandiose ideas, 'Inception' is truly a mind-boggling concept that will intrigue you right from the get-go. The visual effects are spectacular and innovative, while the whole scope of the movie is often staggering.Here's the 'problem', though: This isn't a movie that will stick with me for any prolonged period of time (and thus makes me unable to give it five stars). The plot execution and character development just left a little too much to be desired in sacrifice to the ideas. I can't quite put my finger on it, but (besides the incredible science fiction', 'Inception' just isn't an all-time classic.Thus, while an entertaining watch, I rank 'Inception' well below 'The Matrix' (very similar concepts) and about on par with 'Shutter Island'. Enjoy it far what it is, but don't expect it to be the greatest movie you've ever seen.",7,2,3,11 March 2017
Murder on the Orient Express," Tries To Solve Murder Mystery Blandness But Fails In The Attempt
","Coming into 'Murder On The Orient Express', the main thing I was worried about was that the film would focus so much on the 'whodunnit' that it would fail to consider 'why do we care'. That is a typical problem I find with hard-boiled mystery capers. Funny enough, 'Murder' tries to improve in this very area, but ends up completely striking out in a rather muddled mess of names, faces, and half-baked plots.For a basic plot summary, this film sees famous detective Hercule Poirot (Kenneth Branagh) on a train heading towards his next case. He's hoping to catch some much-needed r-and-r, but when Edward Ratchett (Johnny Depp) is murdered en route, his deductive reasoning and sleuthing is tested as never before. One by one, he questions all the other train passengers, played by an eclectic 'who's who' of Hollywood including Daisey Ridley, Penelope Cruz, Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Judi Dench, & Willem Dafoe (among others).The reason I'll give 'Murder' even four stars is because, in all honesty, it does try to subvert its genre a bit by adding in a human element. This is where the spoilers come in, but all the passengers are found to have a connection to the murdered Ratchett. In the end, Poirot must make a moral choice that previously he's never had to make: does he let a crime go because it was 'deserved', or is it his solemn duty to prosecute to the full extent of the law.This is actually an interesting twist on the 'whodunnit' mystery, and could have been used to great effect. The problem? The 'connection' that all the passengers share just isn't compelling enough to make an audience really care about them. Part of the issue is that instead of really setting up that angle in the early goings, we get 20 minutes of Poirot kind of just clowning around...totally pointless and a waste of time that could have really been used to flesh out the history of the crime that is later examined in detail.As it is, however, the emotional reason we are supposed to care about these passengers is only given through snippets of dialogue, very short flashbacks, and so many names (in such a short period) that I was often confused by who was who. Not conducive at all, obviously, to what director Branagh was trying to accomplish.Overall, then, 'Murder on the Orient Express' tried to be something bigger than it is billed, and while I appreciate that effort, it just doesn't work. Unless you have a soft spot for this literary tale or character (Poirot), or are an enormous fan of whodunnit murder mysteries, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed when the credits roll.",4,3,8,11 November 2017
Defiance," A Solid WW2 Tale From A New Perspective
","When I think of World War 2 films, I usually think of graphic war scenes, Holocaust themes, or military strategy. This film takes a completely different approach to the WW2 era, showing it from the point of view of a group of Jewish citizens trying to avoid capture and survive out in the woods.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the two eldest Bielski brothers (Tuvia & Zus), who lead a band of fleeing Jews into the woods when the Germans begin to invade Eastern Europe. While out in the Belarussian forest, the Bielski boys must not only feed hungry mouths and keep away from the Germans, but also navigate through different political/military strategies and the shady Russian army (in which you never know who to trust).This movie may not be an all-time classic, but it is a very solid WW2 tale told from a perspective I'm not accustomed to (and thus rather fresh). Being based on a true story, it is remarkable to consider the odds that the vagrant Jews faced just to survive each day, nonetheless maintain their freedom.The two acting leads (Daniel Craig & Liev Schreiber) are very compelling, while none of the auxiliary cast are exceptionally bad. Though it is a bit slow in the beginning, by the end the plot/characters will really have you rooting for success.Thus, I recommend this film to WW2 enthusiasts of all kind. If you don't expect a masterpiece, and are content with a good story from a new angle, you will enjoy this film very much.",7,2,2,10 March 2017
WALL·E," One Of A Kind, To Be Sure
","Some movies are good because they take a tried and true formula and add a unique twist. Others are good because they do something completely different and unexpected. 'Wall-E' falls squarely into the latter category.The story is simple: In a post-apocalyptic world, a trash-collecting robot (WALL-E) wanders the desolate terrain. One day, a visitor (EVE) descends from the heavens and involves WALL-E in a wild adventure to once more bring life to the barren planet.This entire film is so different from anything Disney/Pixar had produced to that point, yet the overall quality is still top-notch. The story is simple (yet charming), the characters are innocent (halfway in you'll forget that you're essentially watching robots), and the visuals are both unique and spectacular at the same time.Perhaps the hallmark of this fun little film, however, are the numerous sights gags it perpetuates. The Disney/Pixar team knew that since the fare was robots, the 'goofiness' factor could be upped for this effort. On multiple occasions, whether you're four or forty-four, you'll find yourself chuckling at something that just transpired on-screen.Thus, I highly recommend watching this film with the kiddie of your choice. It toes the line between the intellectual humor of Toy Story and the slapstick of Finding Nemo, all the while providing genuine laughs and heart along the way.",9,1,2,11 March 2017
Finding Dory," Another Rollicking Undersea Adventure
","'Finding Nemo' was a landmark, five-star Pixar film both in terms of visuals and locale (underwater world). 'Finding Dory' takes that winning formula, tweaks it just a bit, and produces another rollicking (if slightly less groundbreaking) undersea adventure.For a basic plot summary, 'Finding Dory' focuses on Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), the forgetful little blue tang fish. Early on in the film, Dory--now part of Marlin (Albert Brooks) & Nemo's (Hayden Rolence) family--remembers that she once had parents of her own, and thus the trio hitch a ride with Crush (Andrew Stanton) for the currents of California. Arriving at a Sea World-esque aquatic park, Dory is helped by a number of newcomers to the franchise, such as Hank the octopus (Ed O'Neil), Destiny the whale shark (Kaitlin Olson), and Bailey the Beluga whale (Ty Burrell).Basically, 'Finding Dory' takes the same basic plot formula (rescue adventure) of 'Finding Nemo' and just breathes some new life/characters into it. This approach doesn't really break much new ground, but perhaps such a formula doesn't need to be 'messed with'. I was chuckling at many jokes throughout (all the new characters fit in nicely), and found myself mostly caught up in the sense of adventure.Probably the most interesting choice of the entire experience was Disney/Pixar's focus on Dory's 'disability' (short-term memory loss). For the most part, that is where the emotion of the film comes from...seeing Dory overcome her weaknesses and even turn them into strengths. Whereas in the first film Dory was pretty much played as just the comic relief, this time her personal struggles comprise the main narrative structure of the entire flick.Why not the full five stars? Simply put: because Toy Story 2 was better than Toy Story. Somehow, someway, Disney/Pixar managed to have that sequel transcend its spectacular original, and that didn't necessarily happen here. My final star ranking would be 4.5/5.0, if able.Overall, though, I very much enjoyed the experience of watching 'Finding Dory'. It's an amazing experience to look around the theater and see people of all ages enjoying the same film. I give Disney/Pixar a lot of credit for that. If you were swept away by 'Finding Nemo', you'll get the same kind of adventure/comedy in 'Finding Dory'.",7,3,6,24 February 2017
Arrival," Vaults Villeneuve Into Upper Echelon Of Directors
","I'm always impressed by movies that 'go big' in terms of scope. I have a lot of respect for filmmakers that just 'go for it' and try to make as nuanced of a film as possible in multiple different ways. The problem, however, is that it is a bit of a slippery slope. If done masterfully (usually from a superb director and featuring top-notch acting), you have an all-time classic. If all the concepts aren't grasped, though, you have a muddled mess that doesn't succeed at much while failing at a lot. Fortunately, 'Arrival' is a prime example of the former, as director Dennis Villeneuve vaults himself into the ranks of Nolan, Eastwood, Spielberg, etc. with this effort.For a basic plot summary (no major spoilers), 'Arrival' is the story of Dr. Louise Banks (Amy Adams), who is recruited to a site (one of 12) of an alien 'first contact' of sorts featuring odd cylindrical objects. Louise is an expert linguist, and the government hopes she can break the ice and decode the alien symbology. Paired with scientist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), the pair get to work decoding both the language and the science of this new species. Along the way, they discover that the aliens may be trying to do more than just communicate.'Arrival' is one of the best films I have ever seen...bar none! It combines incredible acting, compelling visuals, and a plot that will stimulate you mentally all the way through. I liken it to a mix of two Nolan films (Interstellar & The Prestige) and Villeneuve's previous work 'Enemy'. There is not one boring scene in the film and each scene builds into the next towards a conclusion that will leave you quite speechless with wonder.I could write for paragraph after paragraph about the intricacies of 'Arrival', but I won't because it is also one of those films where you DO NOT want to be spoiled going in. I won't go so far as to call it a 'twist ending' movie, but just the entire concept of the piece is best enjoyed with an open mind.I really hope that 'Arrival' garners either its own award nominations, or at the very least for Villeneuve, as it truly deserves them. Yes, technically it falls under the 'science fiction' genre (that usually gets shut out come award season), but this movie is oh so much more! It can be enjoyed by everyone and easily crosses all genre/appeal lines. I may have just seen the movie of the year!",10,2,9,27 February 2017
The Terminal," Great Idea + Great Hanks = Entertaining Film
","Sometimes, a movie only needs a great idea and a great actor to be really, really good. 'The Terminal' is an example of that kind of film making. There are a number of things that prevent 'The Terminal' from being an all-time classic, but the performance from Tom Hanks and the 'guy trapped in an airport' premise is enough to make for a very entertaining movie.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Viktor Novorski (Hanks), who is trying to get from his home country of Krakosau into the United States (New York City, to be exact). On the international trip, however, Krakosau is over-run by rebels and no longer recognized by the U.S. government. As a result, Novorski cannot return home, nor can he legally enter America. He is 'trapped' in the airport terminal, waiting for something to happen. Not helping matters is that airport director Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) has it out for Viktor. While patiently waiting for a resolution to his situation, Viktor meets a number of friends, including a potential romantic interest (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman he greets every day trying to get his status validated (Zoe Saldana), and a number of other airport workers who help him be as comfortable as possible in such a strange situation.'The Terminal' is a charming movie mainly because you'll probably never watch a film quite like it. Under the able direction of Steven Spielberg, the movie succeeds in taking a ludicrous situation and making you care about a majority of the proceedings. Of course, it helps to have Hanks in the drivers seat of the leading role, as he turns in yet another performance that will make you think 'this can can play anything!'. Without his presence, this would be a forgettable experience.Unfortunately, 'The Terminal' is completely and utterly unable to capture any romantic chemistry between the Hanks & Zeta-Jones characters. For whatever reason (likely because Zeta-Jones just simply isn't around enough), the emotional backbone of the movie fizzles. For me, this was enough to drop the experience an entire star rating. Had the romance angle been done better, it would have easily been five stars. As it was, there were just too many moments towards the end of the film where I was thinking 'I know I SHOULD be wrapped up in these emotions more, but...' instead of just enjoying the experience.Overall, though, 'The Terminal' is a quirky, entertaining little flick that really emphasizes the 'less is more' philosophy of making a solid cinematic experience. In this case, all it took was a great idea and a great actor. With those components given to Mr. Spielberg, he was able to work his magic (sans a believable romance) with the rest.",7,5,7,27 February 2017
The Blind Side," More Human Interest Than Football
","I made the decision to watch this film for two reasons: One, because I am a football fan, and two, because I like film dramas. Though I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would recommended to anyone, it focuses much more on the 'human drama' angle and very little on the actual football.For a basic plot summary, 'The Blind Side' tells the story of Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), who is adopted by Leigh Anne & Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock; Tim McGraw) and given a respite from life in 'the projects'. A giant of a boy, Michael shows an aptitude for football, learning, and family values under the guidance of the Tuohys, and eventually obtains both a college education and a shot at football's biggest stage--the NFL.Because this is a movie based on a true story, it is tough to know how much of it is actually true. As a sports fan who closely follows the NFL, I know that Mr. Oher himself is uncomfortable talking about the film (or, more specifically, his portrayal in it), so perhaps some liberties were indeed taken to make for a juicier storyline.That being said, this production (for better or worse) is a strong, emotional, human-interest drama that will both warm your heart and make you think. Though the basic concepts and characters are 'vanilla' enough for even younger children to grasp, the more over-arching themes can easily be picked out by adults and thought upon. The acting also helps accomplish this goal, as the entire cast shines in their respective roles.About the only thing that prevents me from giving this film the full five stars is that I felt it could have devoted a bit more time to the 'football side' of things (ala the Michael Lewis book). If done correctly, this movie could have been a sort of 'Social Network', but for the NFL. Instead, to create a more family-friendly film, the production eschews all but a few mentions of actual football.Overall, this is a charming film that is appropriate for anyone. Though not quite 'gritty' enough to be an outright classic, there is something to be said for its saccharine approach to film- making. View with confidence knowing that you won't be looking at your watch throughout or shaking your head at the end.",7,2,2,8 March 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," A Film That Doesn't Fit Into A Genre (And That's What Makes It Great)
","'The Shawshank Redemption' is currently the highest-rated film (on average) on the IMDb website, a position it has held for quite some time. After a recent re-watch, I completely understand the sentiment, and (at least for me) the reason is fairly simple: this is a film that doesn't fit into any certain genre box. Drama? Prison Movie? Caper film? Emotional tear-jerker? Yes to all. My favorite films are the ones that supersede labels, and 'Shawshank' does exactly that.For a basic plot summary, 'Shawshank Redemption' tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man condemned to two life sentences in the maximum-security prison for the murder of his wife. While in Shawshank, Andy quickly befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man who 'knows how to procure certain items' that Andy wants/needs. Andy, through his analytical wisdom, also gets in the good graces of iron-fisted Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and lead guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) by his ability to do tax returns and basically run the prison's money-laundering scheme. While initially this affords Andy some luxuries that other prisoners do not receive, including his persistence in building up the prison library, eventually he comes to a crossroads: become institutionalized or fight back against the system.Without giving away the ending spoilers for those who may not have seen it, 'Shawshank Redemption' is one of those movies that expertly balances the 'side quests', so to speak, with the main plot arc, and everything comes out perfectly. That is a difficult thing to do in a film, as often the sub-plots crowd out the main storyline (instead of adding to it) or seem like filler. Neither of these things come close to happening here, as director Frank Darabont makes sure that balance is achieved.I feel like 'Shawshank' is one of those movies that almost gets the short-shrift in 'greatest of' conversations because it has become so iconic as to almost be 'too present'. The ending is now classic, Freeman's narration is perfection (this was before being almost comically typecast as 'narrator guy' down the road in his career), and every single character is interesting and advances key plots or character development. Basically, 'Shawshank' is almost too iconic for its own good in the sense that it never strays too far from the 'film consciousness'. One has to just make it a priority to sit down and watch it from beginning to end from time to time to truly appreciate its greatness.Perhaps the true staying-power of 'Shawshank', however, is that it truly has 'something for everyone' in terms of plot and characters. Some may get invested in whether Andy is guilty or innocent, others will marvel at his persistence in creating the prison library and contributing to prisoner education, while still others will identify with Red's side of the coin and how his character changes from the beginning of the film to the end of it. For me, the arc that always 'gets' me (moving me to tears) is that of Brooks (James Whitmore), a prisoner for 40+ years at Shawshank who is finally released to the outside world. Despite the apparent freedom, Brooks cannot adapt to life outside the prison structure and social order. Living in a run-down apartment and bagging groceries at the supermarket, he conjures up plans to get himself back into prison where he can 'be somebody' again. Basically, he has become 'institutionalized', and that to me was maybe the most interesting theme in all of 'Shawshank'.Simply put, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a cinematic masterpiece of the highest order. If you haven't seen it yet, you are in for a real treat. Once your kids or relatives are 'of age' to begin to comprehend the film's themes, show it to them too. Or, just sit down and watch it yourself for the ump-teenth time (like I just did). The characters will still be as vibrant and the themes will still be as applicable as the first viewing, and you'll likely pick up something new in every viewing experience. It is that expertly-crafted of a film.",10,1,1,25 May 2017
Parasite," A Solid Metaphor Film
","Let me say right away here that 'Parasite' may very well indeed be even better than a 7/10 star film. For my viewing experience, there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience. No matter how you slice it, though, 'Parasite' is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels.For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two families in South Korea: The Kims are the definition of poor, living in a cramped sub-street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside. The Parks are much wealthier, living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors, drivers, and a housekeeper. Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical, all four Kims become employed (in varying capacities) by the Kims. The juxtaposition between 'clans' is readily apparent, and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes/defines the entire back half of the film's narrative.On the surface, 'Parasite' is pretty entertaining, using a multi-genre approach to keep the viewer's interest. While watching, you will be treated to comedy, drama, farce, seriousness, etc. There is never a dull moment, in other words, and the acting is strong throughout. The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to (from an American viewer perspective) and will quickly become second nature, so don't let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie.More importantly, though, 'Parasite' is also very much a metaphor movie, dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself. I won't go into spoiler details here, but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually/physically portrayed. Multiple, deeper readings/viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze.Like I said in the opening paragraph, 'Parasite' may be objectively higher than 7/10 stars. For me, though, it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state, in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth. Also, and this is very much a personal preference, I prefer metaphor films to 'sneak up on me' as opposed to knowing that going in. With this film, though, the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards, which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings. So, I knew to look for the 'deeper stuff' from the get-go, and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience (and perhaps not for the better).So, as of right now, I'm giving 'Parasite' a 7/10 ranking. A solid film that I enjoyed, but not necessarily amongst my personal all-time favorites. Perhaps upon a second viewing in a different personal/social climate, it will climb the ranks further. It certainly won't go any lower.",7,1,1,24 March 2020
The Big Short," The Corrupt Leading The Corrupt In Compelling Style
","Director Adam McKay has a very unique style of filmmaking. You'll probably love it or hate it, with little in-between. For me, his crazy antics work perfectly in 'The Big Short', telling the story of the 2008 housing crisis and subsequent Wall Street meltdown.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how Wall Street investors and bankers created a housing bubble that essentially broke the economy. Ostensibly narrated by the Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) character, it also focuses on Mark Baum (Steve Carell), an investor betting against the 'common practice' for his own profit, and Michael Burry (Christian Bale), another man doing the same but who initially discovered the housing market being propped up by smoke and mirrors.If you are looking for a straight-forward, ultra-dramatic treatise on the subject, you've come to the wrong place. As I mentioned, McKay just doesn't do things that way. Instead, you'll find characters breaking the fourth wall (turning to talk to the audience), dance breaks, freeze-frames, celebrity cameos, and all other manners of craziness. Instead of being distracting, though, these interludes instead always serve to illustrate a particular point. This is still a comprehensive tale of the housing collapse, but just without the rigidity or serious nature usually reserved for such 'event biopics', if you will.What really helps pull off McKay's vision is the incredible cast, led by Gosling, Bale, and Carell. Those three alone are enough to carry the weight, but even the supporting players provide interesting character opportunities. Add in the humor, music, and genre-defying format that McKay presents, and there's a lot of reasons to get sucked into the proceedings.Perhaps most impressive, however, is that this film will leave you with a lot to think about in terms of who were the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys' in the entire scenario. Things are far from black-and-white in this case, and McKay does a great job of portraying those tensions. Even the characters (like Bale's) set up as 'heroes' to begin with only do so by exploiting the very market they inevitably save (albeit through near-total economic collapse).Overall, 'The Big Short' is an excellent film that successfully recounts a real-life story in a supremely entertaining fashion without being too serious or too over-the-top (though it does come close on that latter front a few times!). This is probably even better than the more recent McKay project 'Vice', as nothing feels quite so personal here. If you want the sub-prime montage scandal explained to you in a quasi-understandable way while at the same time being entertained in nearly every scene, 'The Big Short' is the film for you.",9,3,3,26 May 2020
The Conjuring," A Film With 'Jumps'...But Also A Good Story
","Horror films admittedly are not my favorite genre of film, but when I'm watching a good one it is usually a pretty engrossing experience for me. All too often, horror flicks are just full of 'cheap scares' that are good for getting the boys to wrap their arms a little tighter around their girlfriends. While 'The Conjuring' does provide those moments, it also tells a pretty good demonic possession story along the way.For a basic plot summary, 'The Conjuring' tells the story of Roger (Ron Livingstone), Carolyn (Lili Taylor), and their five daughters who move into a new house that they quickly discover is infested by demonic forces. As such, demonologists Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are called in to try and subdue the hauntings.Obviously, the first criteria any horror movie is judged by is quite simple: is it scary? 'The Conjuring' easily passes that test, as not only does it have some of the requisite 'jump moments', but also some psychological terror as well. It pretty much single-handedly brought the kids game of 'hide-and-clap' back into national consciousness.Beyond the scares, though, the movie tells a pretty intriguing story revolving around demonic possession. In fact, I actually thought the film could have focused even more on those areas (adding more of a 'God vs. Devil' aspect) in order to gain the five-star ranking, but it is still interesting nonetheless. Clearly, director James Wan (also director of the first few 'Saw' movies) knows how to weave a compelling story into a scary narrative.Overall, I enjoyed the experience of 'The Conjuring'. It isn't in my top echelon of scary movies (Halloween, Saw, The Ring), but it is far better than most slashers or gore-fests.",7,1,1,5 March 2017
Halloween," The Standard
","IN 1978, John Carpenter's 'Halloween' set the standard by which all horror flicks both emulated and came to be judged by.For a basic plot summary, 'Halloween' tells the story of psychotic killer Michael Myers, who (15 years after murdering his sister in cold blood) escapes a mental institution and returns to his old stomping grounds to wreak havoc once again, this time on a group of young teenagers on Halloween night.Basically, everything you are accustomed to seeing in a horror film has its roots here, including:-The blood-curdling score, which has never quite been duplicated. -The terrifying, weapon-wielding antagonist who knows nothing but murder. -The standard prey, that being young, sex-crazed teenagers who are so caught up in themselves that they become oblivious to their surroundings. -The 'jump scenes' (often accompanied by loud music crescendos) that make your heart skip a beat, whether true or fake-outs.What's really impressive about this movie, though, is the fact that it was THE standard of horror films for such a long period of time. Until 'Saw' changed the game with its graphic violence and outwardly moral musings in 2004, 'Halloween' was the king of scary movies. 'Friday the 13th' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' may have had their followings, and 'Scream' did a great job of poking fun at the genre, but it was this flick that still remained on top of the heap (it helps to have your own built-in holiday, too!).Thus, if you are a fan of fright fests whatsoever and haven't yet seen this film all the way through (hard to believe, I know), it is a must-see. Or, if you don't have trick-or-treating responsibilities on October 31st, then settle in for another go-round of the seminal horror event.",10,8,11,11 March 2017
Wonder Woman," This Is How You Make An Entertaining Superhero Movie
","Despite that fact that 'Wonder Woman' came out in the summer of 2017, it took me until nearly December to finally watch it. The reason? I had almost reached the end of my rope with DC Universe movies. I hated 'Man of Steel', 'Suicide Squad' was a well-polished disappointment, and 'Batman vs Superman' was almost comically inept. As such, I really had no desire to give DC films any more of my time. However, with all the good 'WW' reviews and word-of-mouth, I finally relented (it being released in 4K helped tremendously on that front). What I found was a surprisingly competent and entertaining film that (at least for a moment) breathes a little bit of new life into the DC film franchise.For a basic plot summary, 'Wonder Woman' tells the story of Diana (Gal Gadot), a woman living on an island of Amazons whose sole purpose are to protect the world from Ares, the God of War. While training to become a warrior, Diana witnesses the crashing of a military plane piloted by WWI spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). When he explains the state of the world to Diana (the scope of WWI), she is convinced that Ares must be acting through German general Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his demented chemist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya). As such, Diane defies her people and leaves the island, wishing to be brought to the Front of the war to take on Ares herself.The fact that the plot of this film is set up so simply really serves 'Wonder Woman' well, I think. Instead of trying to create a complicated scenario, director Patty Jenkins realizes that the success of the movie hinges on the character interactions, overall message, and action sequences.Let's take a quick look at those things one at a time:-The action sequences are thrilling. DC always does a good job with that. -The overall message is one of positivity and hope. Because Diana is so foreign to our culture, her viewpoint of humanity is quite instructive and fuels much of the movie. -The character interactions are the hallmark of the film, however. Gadot & Pine have incredible chemistry, and their scenes carry much of the experience.Is 'Wonder Woman' a perfect film? No. A few things came off as a bit too silly for me, and it isn't really as deep as, say, 'Batman Begins' was. But considering where the DC universe films were heading, 'WW' is a HUGE step back in the right direction.I'm still wary of pretty much all things DC (I have not and will not see 'Justice League' in theaters), but 'Wonder Woman' stood out in a good way. Put Zack Snyder behind the camera again and it all probably comes crashing down. But in the Jenkins-led 'Wonder Woman', it mostly worked.",8,8,14,26 November 2017
Despicable Me," A Different Approach Than Pixar
","After pretty much working my way through all the Disney/Pixar animated films, 'Despicable Me' was my first venture into Universal territory. The filmmaking styles are most definitely different, although I would argue that Pixar still holds a big edge.For a basic plot summary, 'Despicable Me' tells the story of Dr. Gru (voiced by Steve Carell), a supervillian trying to stay on top of the supervillian world. While dueling with the young, up-and- coming supervillians, Dr. Gru gets involved with a trio of orphan girls who eventually lend him some basic humanity.Clearly, Universal utilizes a completely different formula than Pixar. Here, the animation is a little goofier and the action almost never ceases. A bit of emotion is still injected into the film, but nowhere near Pixar levels. In this case, the never-ending action gets a bit tiresome and the emotion is actually a bit too little, too late.Overall, however, 'Despicable Me' will entertain all children with its fast pace, quirky humor, and abundance of sight gags. For folks any older, though, it just doesn't measure up to the Pixar stable of emotional depth and all-ages humor.",6,1,1,10 March 2017
Back to the Future Part II," A Two-Hour Extension Of The Most Genre-Diverse Film Ever Made
","While watching the first Back To The Future installment, viewers are given wild action, intense drama, side-splitting comedy, innocent romance, and about a zillion sight/character gags sprinkled throughout. Whew! Just when things seem to be slowing down, however, Doc Brown races back to 1985 and whisks Marty and Jennifer into the future (via a souped-up, flying Delorean time machine) to solve a problem regarding the newly budding couple's kids. This sets the stage for Back To The Future II.Basically, the plot of this film sees the trio of Marty, Jennifer, and Doc going ahead in time to the year 2015, where they must rectify a certain situation that will inevitably lead to dire consequences for all parties involved. However, after seemingly putting the future in 'good working order', they are in for a shock when they return to 1985 and find a few 'changes' have taken place due to their meddlings, of which only a trip back to that fateful 'Clock Tower' night of 1955 is needed to get 'back to the (real) future'.The main appeal of this second effort in the trilogy is its ability to seamlessly connect/incorporate the events of the first film into these two hours. Though the third film seems to lack a bit of the energy and inventiveness that made the original so great, 'Part II' 'fluxes' at full 'capacity' all the way through.Thus, if you were blown away by the original Back To The Future film, have no qualms about immediately seeking out its first sequel, as it will continue to entertain you like never before.",10,1,1,12 March 2017
Carrie," The Incredible Themes Carry Somewhat Cheesy Movie
","The 'Carrie' story originally penned by Stephen King contained some of the most interesting and truly uncomfortable themes ever put to paper in a story. This movie effectively captures those themes despite (at times) trying to turn into a cheesy slasher flick. Because of this, it still remains a classic to this day.For a basic plot summary, 'Carrie' sees high schooler Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) undergo her first menstrual period in the most embarrassing way possible. Having not been educated about 'those things' because of her religion-obsessed mother Margaret (Piper Laurie), Carrie struggles to understand what is happening to her. Not helping matters is the fact that Carrie also begins to develop a sort of telekinesis, allowing her to move objects with her mind when her emotions get out of control. When fellow student Sue Snell (Amy Irving) gets Carrie to the senior prom, the event that will change Carrie's life forever occurs.Like I said, this movie is great because its themes hit so close to home. I would almost go so far to say that 'Carrie' should almost be required viewing for teen girls entering high school. There are just so many concepts (religion, becoming a woman, parental relations, friendship, etc.) floating around throughout this film that there is usually always 'something to think about'.Perhaps the hallmark of the overall experience, though, is the Spacek/Laurie acting duo. Their scenes are probably the most gripping of the show and, once again, hit really close to home sometimes when it comes to religion.The only thing I don't particularly care for about this movie is that director Brian de Palma at times tries to turn it into a 'teen slasher' flick. I mean, he casts P.J. Soles for crying out loud! Luckily, he doesn't go too far from King's brilliant story, but there are times (if you've read the book) where you might think 'okay...let's be moving on here'.Overall, 'Carrie' is a classic films with themes that will stand the test of time. I hear that it is being remade in 2013, and I feel that they will have a tough time living up to this rendition.",8,2,3,8 March 2017
Marriage Story," Individual Performances Carry The Day
","When I first saw the trailer for 'Marriage Story', I was intrigued by the concept and cast. When it started gaining buzz and racking up award nominations in droves, I knew it was something I was going to see. While there were certain parts of the film I enjoyed very much, overall I found it slightly lacking in one key area: drawing real, visceral emotion out of the viewer.For a very basic overview, 'Marriage Story' is a tale about Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), a married couple in the beginning stages of separation/divorce. Not wanting to make things too messy for son Henry (Azhy Robertson), Charlie & Nicole want to keep things civil--until the lawyers get involved, drawing some passion out of the all sides.Easily the best part of this film for me was the acting from Driver and Johansson. They both give performances that are very much award-worthy and complement each other perfectly. At one point, Driver absolutely brings down the house with his rendition of 'Being Alive', while Johansson is a wonder to watch slowly unfurl her emotions as the movie progresses. I'd have no problem with either of them taking home some hardware during awards season.The problem I had with this film, however, is that it seemed like every time it looked to be kicking into a high emotional gear, something would happen to stop that momentum in its tracks. The lawyers (played by Laura Dern, Alan Alda, & Ray Liotta) are the most egregious examples of this, as those scenes constituted easily my least favorite ones of the whole experience. They sort of turn the proceedings into 'Divorce Story' rather than 'Marriage Story', which throws things off track.To me, the best scenes in the movie are when Driver and Johansson simple co-exist on screen together. They might end up talking very calmly with each other at first, but then the escalation continues and by the end they are screaming in frustration/rage. These are the types of scenes that win awards. Like I said, it's too bad that momentum kept getting interrupted.For whatever reason, it just felt like this film was about a half-step 'off' for me the whole way. Like all the ingredients were there for it to be really emotional, but rarely did they coalesce properly and actually do so. Like I said, the acting in the piece should be rewarded handsomely, but in terms of the film/plot as a whole, I can't quite put this one into my upper echelon.",7,4,6,22 December 2019
Taken 2," A Rare Feat Of Successful Repetition
","Despite being a pretty darn good overall movie in its own right, the original 'Taken' succeeds primarily because Liam Neeson makes the leap from solid character actor to leading man. His performance is what carries the show. In this sequel, the filmmakers are able to replicate pretty much the same scenarios as that original and get away with it because of the raw emotion involved in both the stories and the characters.For a basic plot summary, 'Taken 2' sees the same gang that abducted Kim (Maggie Grace) in the first movie now looking for revenge against parents Brian (Neeson) and Lenore (Famke Janssen).There are two reasons why this film works so well despite using much of the same subject matter as the original:1. The emotions behind the simple revenge-based plot are so visceral. Grace's persona of Kim is so innocent (but yet true-to-life) that one cannot help but root for her either to be the hero or the one being saved by the hero. Simply put, she's the on-screen daughter that everyone wants to protect.2. With that first crucial plot step in place, Neeson's magnificent character is given a chance to shine. With Grace providing the dramatic moments, Neeson brings the action and intensity with a passion. Film buffs recently learned that Neeson's distinctive baritone means nothing without a great plot/drama behind it (see: 'Unknown'). When given the opportunity to hone his character, though, Neeson can provide relentless intensity with as little as a few words.Overall, 'Taken 2' is a strong sequel to the original. It pretty much contains all the 'same stuff' as the first one, but the characters are still relatable and the action is still top-notch. If you really enjoyed 'Taken', this will probably not be a disappointment for you.",6,1,1,3 March 2017
The Silence of the Lambs," An Exercise In Creepiness
","Every once in awhile, a film comes along that introduces a character so original that it is impossible to turn away. 'Silence of the Lambs' is exactly this type of experience.For a basic plot summary, 'Silence of the Lambs' sees young FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) given her first assignment: interrogate Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector (Anthony Hopkins), a former psychologist-turned-psychopath. In trying to glean some information from Hannibal about the grizzly 'Buffalo Bill' murders, Clarice catches the caged madman's sense of gamesmanship and enters into a battle of wits with the thought-provoking Lector.This film primarily works because of the Hannibal Lector character. From out of nowhere, he becomes one of the most iconic villains in cinema history. He's clearly a crazed personality (as evidenced by his cannibalistic tendencies), but at the same time he is utterly brilliant ability to dissect the inner human psyche. His inner battle of wits with Agent Starling is incredibly interesting material that never gets old no matter how many times it is viewed.However, the film is also just an overall general masterpiece in pretty much all areas. The basic plot involving the Buffalo Bill maniac is chilling (especially the heart-pounding ending), the music is also creepily in the background, and the visuals are scary while still managing to be realistic.Simply put, this is one of the greatest suspense thrillers ever made. It created an iconic character, launched the career of Jodi Foster, and carved itself a place in many 'greatest of all- time' lists. I've viewed it multiple times and it always seems to evoke the same creepy emotions every single time (the mark of a truly chilling viewing experience).",10,2,5,7 March 2017
Vanilla Sky," How Can You Be 100% Sure You Aren't Dreaming Right Now?
","The strange thing about dreams is that, while in one, the dreamer usually does not realize a dream is taking place. Only upon the conclusion of the dream experience is an individual able to distinguish between dream and reality. That concept is the driving force behind 'Vanilla Sky'.
For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on David Aames (Tom Cruise), the heir to a vast business fortune who is very much a playboy. At a party one night, David is smitten by exotic beauty Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) and begins a relationship with her. When jealous fling Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz) finds out, however, she involves David in an accident that will change his life forever. Because this is a 'big reveal' type of film, I will not say anything more here to prevent spoilers.
There are two primary reasons that 'Vanilla Sky' is such an extraordinary film:
First, it is very much high-concept. Much like 'Inception', or 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', this movie deals with dreams and how they affect the dreamers. This plot line is almost guaranteed to make you think while viewing, and it will likely be still rattling around in your brain for awhile after viewing.
Secondly, though, is that a film like 'Vanilla Sky' can only work if it contains incredible character development, which it indeed achieves. In order to truly appreciate both the ending and the overall journey, both the writing and acting must be spot-on. It is, and as such will leave you feeling as if you truly care about the struggles of David Aames and his world.
Overall, 'Vanilla Sky' is an excellent concept film that ranks right up there with 'Eternal Sunshine', 'Memento', 'The Matrix', and the like. It even has very much of a romantic aspect for those who enjoy high emotion. Simply put, the only people this movie won't appeal to are those purely wanting action/adventure. This one will make you think, but it is more than worth it in the end.(After a recent re-watch, I dropped this movie down from 10/10 to 7/10 stars. This film has lost a bit of its luster for me in the re-watch process and feels a bit dated. The themes are still interesting and the concept is high, but it has been knocked off the lofty pedestal I once perched it on).",7,1,2,9 March 2017
Win Win," A Movie For Our Times
","Many films (for better or worse) portray an idealized form of life/drama to combat the current economic malaise. 'Win Win' is not that kind of film; instead choosing to revel in the struggles of day-to-day life and work through them.For a basic plot summary, 'Win Win' sees Mike Flaherty (Paul Giamatti) struggling to make a living for himself and his family. His law practice is hemorrhaging funds, the bills are piling up at home, and his health is even failing due to the anxiety. After becoming personally involved with a client (Burt Young), Mike 'inherits' a son (Alex Shaffer) who provides a spark for his high school wrestling team and lifts his spirits. That is, of course, until life intercedes once again.In better times, this might be the kind of movie that people would stay away from due to the fact that is is so down-to-earth in its portrayal of life's struggles. In tough times, though, 'Win Win' really resonates on a personal level. The struggles of life are not black-and-white, but full of shades of grey and ambiguity.Also, while the film is well-acted as a general rule, Giamatti's performance is especially moving. Giammatti is one of the great character actors of our time and never fails to shine on the big screen. There's no one who can match his style of acting in terms of combining over-the-top physical/verbal acting with dramatic intensity.About the only thing that prevents this movie from being a true classic is that the climax doesn't necessarily live up to the build-up. Don't worry, though, as the rich characters and believable circumstances are more than enough to provide compelling drama and entertainment.",9,1,1,11 March 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," This Is How You End An Epic Series
","In the prologue of Christopher Nolan's film 'The Prestige', a Michael Caine voice-over explains that, in order to conduct a successful magic trick, 'it isn't enough to make something disappear...you have to bring it back'. In 'Dark Knight Rises', another Nolan masterpiece, the genius director does exactly that.For a basic plot summary, 'Dark Knight Rises' sees Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), now a sort of shut-in hermit, retired from the role of Batman as Gotham City has rallied around the Harvey Dent myth in order to clean up its streets. When jewel thief Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) breaks into Wayne Manor and steals a family heirloom, however, Bruce is curious enough to pursue her. Along the way, Bruce stumbles into a new plot from the League of Shadows, now led by the seemingly unstoppable Bane (Tom Hardy), and realizes that Batman must return. However, the transition back to the Caped Crusader, as predicted by butler Alfred (Michael Caine) and 'gadget guy' Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), is not as easy as it seems.This is one of those movies where not a single scene or character emotion is wasted. It runs for two hours and 45 minutes, but it seems like nothing due to the fact that the narrative is practically seamless in the way that it holds the viewing interest. This is accomplished in a variety of different ways, including...-A storyline that is the natural continuation (and ending) of the Nolan/Bale Batman trilogy. Each movie ('Begins', 'Knight', & 'Rises') are stand-alone achievements in their own right, yet they are also part of a coherent whole that is ended by this chapter.-Characters so compelling that they almost seem real. In a stroke of genius, Nolan takes the new villain-Bane-and, in his own way, makes him just as interesting as Heath Ledger's Joker (quite an arduous task if you've seen 'Dark Knight'). You known the character development is spot-on when you start actually feeling a bit frightened of a certain character, as I did on numerous occasions regarding Bane. He is that visceral of a presence. Hathaway's Kyle/Catwoman also provides a strong (if perhaps at times rushed) presence to the film, as she is the one who truly draws Bruce Wayne back into social society once again.-The soundtrack and cinematography complement each other perfectly. You don't see much see or hear as FEEL the chant from Bane's underground prison, or the roar of the Batpod as it motors down Gotham's streets.-The actual ending scene(s) themselves, which (while I won't give them away here) are perhaps the most perfect way I have ever seen a director end such a large and expansive franchise. Nolan's 'Batman mythology' is complete, yet the story continues (if that makes any sense).Simply put, 'Dark Knight Rises' is one of the overall finest films ever produced, considering the scale of what it had to accomplish and the expectations it was living up to. Rarely has such a movie been made that has absolutely everything and can appeal to such a large audience (plus being based on a fictional superhero to boot!). See it if you even have an inkling that you should.",10,2,5,7 March 2017
Any Given Sunday," Nothing But A 'Vehicle' Film
","Sometimes, movies are made where the sole purpose is to provide a vehicle for its stars or producers to bigger and better things. These 'vehicle flicks' can, from time to time, be well- made, but most of the time they are shallow and focus on all the wrong things. That is a very apt description of 'Any Given Sunday'.For a basic plot summary, 'Sunday' focuses on the Sharks, a pro football team coach by 'Al Pacino'. When star quarterback 'Dennis Quaid' goes down with an injury, third-stringer 'Jamie Foxx' must step in and lead the team to the playoffs, all the while trying to be competitive so that owner 'Cameron Diaz' can leverage the city for more money on a stadium deal.Unless you are hopped up on Red Bull or steroids, this movie is pretty much an incoherent mess. It has no discernible plot, completely cardboard-cutout characters, and every single scene is punctuated by loud, driving, rock/rap music that essentially makes this experience feel like a 2.5 hour music video.Instead, this is strictly a vehicle for these purposes: -Getting Diaz in a few more sexy evening gowns -Showcasing Foxx as 'leading man' material -Letting director Oliver Stone screw around for 150 minutes and throw theme after theme in our face while developing none of them -LL Cool J showing he can 'act' as well as rap.The ONLY bright spot of this experience is the epic speech given by Pacino's character before the film's climax. Surrounded by utter dreck on both sides, that speech will (if only for a few minutes) get you fired up about something.Other than that, though, 'Any Given Sunday' is a total mess. The inclusion of James Woods (perhaps the single worst/most annoying actor of his time) almost seems fitting for such a stinker. If you are a pigskin fan who wanted to enjoy this one, I suggest you do so in the middle of a roid rage or other crazy emotional moment. At any normal time, this is 2.5 hours of time utterly wasted.",1,3,9,5 March 2017
Mother!," The Most Pretentious Director In Hollywood Strikes Again
","First off, let me say right off the bat: I understand that this is an allegory film. If a viewer doesn't understand that part of things, this film will make absolutely no sense whatsoever.For a basic plot summary, 'mother!' sees Mother (Jennifer Lawrence), and I'm using the billed names here, living in a falling-down house that she is repairing with Him (Javier Bardem). One day, Him invites a Man (Ed Harris) and a Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) into the house, and things start to get weird. Eventually Man and Woman's two sons, Oldest (Domhnall Gleeson) and Youngest (Brian Gleeson), join the proceedings, and a murder takes place. From here, the events spin even further out of control and descend into complete and utter madness.The allegory here is that Lawrence's character is Mother Earth, Bardem's is God, while Harris/Pfeiffer are Adam/Eve and their sons Cain and Abel. Once you understand that framework, this film is (at very least) watchable. Without it, the narrative makes no sense whatsoever.Even understanding the allegory, though, can't lead me to a better appreciation of the film. The problem, IMHO, is that Darren Aronofsky is establishing himself as perhaps the most pretentious director in Hollywood. First, he pretty much makes a mockery of 'Noah' (that film is bad whether you believe the Biblical story or not). Now, he uses similar religious and classic themes in such a messy fashion that it really isn't all that meaningful or thought-provoking.The message here is that humans are destroying the planet and God is helping them with the task. If that is Aronofsky's view of humanity, then so be it. I'm not overly religious, nor am I an outspoken atheist, so I like to consider myself open to possibilities. The problem here, though, is that I think the 'humans are destroying the Earth' narrative needs to be mediated by some positivity.Simply put, I don't want to sit for two hours and watch a film that brow-beats me. At least, not one that doesn't allow for a possibility of change. It very much feels like Aronofsky sitting up on his high horse condemning the rest of us, which feels incredibly pretentious to me.Had this film done something other than criticize, I think I would have enjoyed it much more than I did. As it stands, however, 'mother!' to me is just too pretentious to ever deliver an interesting or entertaining message.",4,3,3,25 December 2017
Creed II," Not Quite Its Predecessor, But Close Enough To Still Be Great
","The first Creed film, released in 2015, was masterful in crafting a new boxing tale for a new generation, all the while respecting the legacy that Sylvester Stallone had created for that universe. While Creed II may not quite nail that nearly perfect balance all the time, it does a remarkable job as sequels go.For a basic plot summary, Creed II sees Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan) now an established pugilist fighting for championships with Rocky Balboa (Stallone) still in his corner. At the same time, Adonis is taking the first steps toward family life with Bianca (Tessa Thompson). Out of nowhere (well, the deep recesses of the old Soviet Union, to be more specific), old Balboa nemesis Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) and monstrous son Viktor (Florian Munteanu), also a fighter, show up to challenge Donnie to a match. With the legacy of his father and name on the line, Donnie ultimately accepts the challenge...but this time 'Unc' (Rocky) will not support him.To me, the first Creed was an Oscar-worthy (if not winning, sadly) type of film. Creed II isn't quite that 'tight', but it still makes enough interesting choices and creates genuine emotion to be a great film.Thematically, the movie is kind of a mashup of themes from Rocky II, III, & IV, what with Adonis coming to terms with family life, struggling to recapture that 'eye of the tiger', if you will, and finally confronting the paternal demons that continue to haunt him. For the most part, director Steven Caple Jr. deftly balances all those themes. Then, of course, there is the presence of Stallone's Rocky himself, which is always in danger of being a distraction to the overall proceedings but never comes close to that, due to solid writing and Stallone's just general understanding of the character. 'Legacy characters' can often bog down films they appear in, but the exact opposite happens here: when Rocky is on-screen, his mannerisms and dialogue are an absolute delight.One filmmaking choice I really enjoyed was the focus on the Drago family. Starting the entire picture off with them really set a tone that was doggedly pursued throughout. To be completely honest, I actually think that this angle could have been played up even more over the course of the movie, as it was fascinating to me how Viktor's journey compared to that of Adonis's. I realize why it didn't comprise a larger portion of the action (most people watching this film likely do not know all the implications of the Drago name in this franchise), but for the die-hards it easily could have. As it stands, that family plot still works just well enough to pay off in the end.Overall, I came into Creed II with admittedly impossibly high expectations considering my reverence for the original. While I can't say that it checked every box quite as perfectly as that Ryan Coogler-directed previous installment did, it comes close enough to still maintain that sense of gravitas and emotion all the way through. Whether you've been a fan of Rocky since 1976 or are coming to the entire franchise through the Creed side of things, you'll be entertained and moved by the experience here.",8,5,11,22 November 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Built On Too Many Faulty Premises
","There is no criticism of 'Batman v Superman' that the film or its creators cannot in some way rebuke. All they have to do is point to the box office totals. I get it. However, the money/hype this movie drives shouldn't be confused with the fact that, at its core, it isn't a very good movie at all. It was just brilliantly marketed and captured a wide swath of initial audiences. In dissecting the flick, though, one quickly discovers that it was built on too many faulty premises to succeed.For a basic plot summary, 'B v S' sees Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) substantially angry that Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) caused so much destruction and collateral damage during his fight with Zod (Michael Shannon) at the end of the previous 'Man of Steel' movie. This leads to some serious animosity between the two heroes, with Superman fighting his own battles of conscience while Batman schemes for revenge and justice. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) tries to be a voice of reason, but with Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) whispering into the ear of both Clark & Bruce, the stage is quickly set for a confrontation. On the outside looking in is mysterious newcomer Diane Prince (Gal Gadot), who catches the eye of both men ends up a key player 'down the stretch'.Let me start with the one (and only) thing that 'B v S' does right: Director Zack Snyder is an 'action man', renowned for his ability to choreograph pulse-pounding fights and action sequences up on the big screen. So, the 20-25 minutes where this movie actually shifts into full- on action movie is pretty exciting and epic.Sadly, that is the only positive thing I took from the experience, as it is built on too many other faulty premises to even take seriously: -For a film that should have played to director Snyder's strong suits, why is so much time spent on character-building (an area where Snyder has no track record whatsoever)? Simply put, this should have been a 'Justice League' movie right from the get-go. Instead, it put itself in the awkward position of trying to re-hash many of the old Bat/Supes tropes just because this was the film that was supposed to launch the 'DC Universe' (after years of getting smoked by Marvel at the box office). What that means, though, is hours of character development from a director who doesn't know how to do it, leading to a bad situation. -Superman will never work as a 'dark' character...it just isn't what the character was intended to be. You can't just copy-and-paste the Batman backstory onto Superman just because Christopher Nolan did it so well with Batman in his trilogy. This was readily apparent in 'Man of Steel' and nothing has changed here. -So much of this film is set up for a Batman vs. Superman confrontation that will ultimately end in disappointment. There's a reason why this hasn't been tried on the big screen until now...because dramatically it just doesn't work. Too many predictability issues. Not helping matters is the fact that this sequence of the film ends with one of the lamest, most see-through 'revelations' that I have ever seen on screen. -Eisenberg may be a decent Luthor...but most certainly not for this movie. I mean, why is he young when the entire rest of the universe is supposed to be older? It doesn't make sense in terms of story.Basically, here is what I think happened with 'B v S': 'Man of Steel' was just successful enough that Warner Brothers didn't want to upset the apple cart by changing directors. So, they stuck with Snyder even if it meant sacrificing story/characters going forward. To WB, it was strictly a financial investment, as they didn't want to start back at square one in their pursuit of Marvel. So, they stuck it out with Snyder and (at least on the surface) seemed to create a movie (at least based on the trailers) that would play to his strengths (action/fight scenes). Tease an epic confrontation, tease Wonder Woman, tease Justice League, and cut some great trailers to build hype. But when one gets down to 'brass tacks', you find a film that didn't take any risks or bring anything new to the table. It had the perfect setup to be a big financial success, and the entire project was comfortable being exactly that, as if the bean-counters had more input into this film's construction then the creative people.Like I said at the beginning of this review, however, 'Batman vs Superman' will be considered a success for Warner Brothers just for the sheer monetary numbers it will pull in. I can't argue with that line of thinking, and let's face it: I knew I probably wouldn't like this one (I didn't too much care for 'Man of Steel'), but I felt like I had to see it. As a longtime fan of Batman and Superman, it felt wrong to just 'not go'. My point is this: Let's not confuse financial success with creative success in the analysis of this movie. There are many other things and situations that go into selling movie tickets that are far beyond 'how good the movie is'. This film pulled out all the stops in that regard. That still doesn't make it a good movie.I'd give 'B v S' 1.5 stars if I could (I save 1-star rankings for films that truly are abominations...although I considered it here). It scoots by on the bare minimum of creative storytelling or character development, instead letting its own 'hype machine' determine its overall success. Fool me once, WB ('Man of Steel'), shame on you. Fool me twice ('B v S'), shame on me. Despite a mild fascination with the upcoming 'Suicide Squad', I will definitely be skipping out on any further Justice League films with Snyder at the helm.",3,2,6,25 February 2017
Blade Runner," Those Who Enjoy Deep Story/Character Flicks Need Not Apply
","A number of years ago (when I was probably too young to be watching it in the first place), I watched 'Blade Runner' and was utterly confused and disappointed by the whole thing. Cut to the present and now perhaps my favorite film director, Denis Villeneuve, is making 'Blade Runner 2049' for release this fall. As such, I gave the original 'Blade Runner' another chance to see if I was perhaps 'missing something' (it seems to be widely considered one of the best sci-fi flicks ever). While I now understand what the movie is 'supposed to be', so to speak, I can also better articulate why it won't appeal to a certain viewing audience.For a basic plot summary, 'Blade Runner' is set in 2019 Los Angeles, where the Tyrell (Joe Turkel) Corporation has begun making human replicant (or 'skin jobs') cybernetic beings for slave labor in the 'Off-World' colonies. Predictably, a group of these beings, led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), rebel and commandeer a vessel back to Earth, where they will wreak havoc if not dealt with. This is where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) comes in, as he is the best in the business at dealing with these replicants. Along the way, Deckard comes across a new type of replicant, Rachael (Sean Young), that challenges him in ways not previously seen.There is no doubt that 'Blade Runner' is based on a very interesting, pure science fiction concept: human consciousness in a machine body. There are thousands of stories that could be told on this topic, and many already have been across cinema. The trouble with 'Blade Runner', though, is that it doesn't care all that much in digging into the meat-and-potatoes of those stories.Instead, this is a film primarily concocted out of love of noir and setting. Director Ridley Scott (much like he did in his earlier 'Alien' effort) is vastly more interested in exploring the dark underbelly of a future LA than he is in crafting a really tight story. As such, much of 'Blade Runner' showcases the aesthetics of the landscape. If you are really into that sort of thing, this movie will rocket up your list.For those more pulled in by story and character development, however, 'Blade Runner' only gives out as many nuggets as it needs to in his department. In fact, most of the context of the entire picture is given in an opening text crawl. There are a few 'story moments' scattered throughout the movie, but they are truly few and far between and too short to satisfy those looking for them.So, I think the litmus test of whether a viewer will enjoy 'Blade Runner' comes down to how much you enjoy the noir/aesthetic of a film, as that is the film's primary purpose. Does it touch on some interesting ideas/characters? Yes. Does it explore them in any deeper fashion? Absolutely not.",4,5,11,3 August 2017
The Greatest Showman," A Unique Presentation Befitting Barnum Himself
","The success of 'La La Land' opened Hollywood up to the musical again, and 'The Greatest Showman' is able to take full advantage. While traditionally the story of P.T. Barnum would be told as a biopic, here it is given a flourish that perhaps the old ringmaster himself would appreciate.For a basic plot summary, 'Greatest Showman' tells the story of how P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) built his circus empire. This was largely accomplished by using 'freaks' (bearded lady, dog-faced boy, etc.) to draw curiosity to his museum and later shows. Though initially deemed as catering to the 'lowest common denominator', Barnum's shows eventually won over the hearts of people (especially children) around the world. Also focused on in this flick is Barnum's marriage to Charity (Michelle Williams) and partnership with Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron).By positioning itself in the way that it does, 'Greatest Showman' only deflects any criticism that can be thrown at it. Not entirely indicative of Barnum's life? The man himself would revel in the drama! Too over-the-top or schmaltzy? Have you ever been to the circus?! In this sense, the film is practically immune to harsh takes.In terms of execution, the music is wonderful and the visuals are stunning and always offering something new. The tone is a good mix between relentless energy, but also being able to slow down and appreciate the softer moments when needed. The ability to accomplish this makes for high emotion with every song.The cast is about as diverse as a circus show itself, what with the eclectic mix of Jackman, Williams Efron, Zendaya, & Rebecca Ferguson. They all perform very well and create a great chemistry on the screen.Personally, 'Greatest Showman' will never be among my favorite films of all-time. I actually prefer a more straightforward, character-drama biopic approach. However, I can very easily see the appeal of the musical tact here, and enjoyed it enjoy to be thoroughly entertained. If you are more open to this crazier approach than I, the star ranking will likely tick even higher.",7,3,4,21 September 2018
Monsters University," Still Funny After 12 Years
","Considering that the original 'Monsters Inc.' was released all the way back in 2001, I was interested to see if this long-time-coming sequel could re-capture the magic. By-and-large, it does with that patented PIXAR mix of humor and heart.For a basic plot summary, this film details the meeting of young one-eyed monster Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman) at Monsters University, a monster-world school for 'scarers'. Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) also plays a role (a 'returning' character from 'Inc.'), while a group of geeky monster freshmen discover what working together and for a better future is all about.Simply put, 'Monsters U' is a very solid effort in the animation category. To be sure, it is not in the upper-echelon (Toy Story, Nemo, Tangled, Wall-E), but it is purely entertaining. The humor will make even adults laugh (or any of those who can relate to the college experience), while the 'heart' moments (while not quite as emotional as 'Inc.') are present and in the right places.I had fun watching this flick with my younger sister...simple as that. It doesn't go on any of my 'best of' lists or anything like that, but I would recommend it for family viewing to anyone. Even after 12 years away from Mike and Sullivan, director Dan Scanlon manages to keep the characters and their universe relevant.",7,2,4,5 March 2017
Casino Royale," The Beginning Of Bond
","The James Bond franchise has always been a bit of a mystery to me. Though I've seen them all and enjoyed most of them, I'm always amazed that the formulaic elements that comprised EVERY SINGLE Bond film (theme, girl, gadgets, suit, quips, etc.) never seem to get old. Studios could keep pumping them out for decades and still have a core audience. With 'Casino Royale', however, that formula is turned on its head a bit in telling an 'early Bond' story chronologically before all the others. This new convention, and the subtleties (instead of over-the-top antics) seem to completely refresh the series and make this installment my personal favorite.For a basic plot summary, 'Casino Royale' sees a newly-minted 007 (Daniel Craig) on his first assignment from M (Judi Dench). In trying to expose terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), Bond meets up with Felix (Jeffrey Wright) and falls for the beautiful Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).What makes 'Casino Royale' ultimately so successful is that it actually DOES contain most of the usual 'Bond cannon' material that we are all so used to seeing. Instead of being overt and flaunting such material, like the last few Brosnan flicks, this one takes a much more subtle tone. For example, Craig's Bond is (at first) taken aback by his new 'fitted dinner jacket', doesn't quite know how he wants his martini, and actually falls for a woman for her overall personality and not...well, you know. Seeing this 'beginning of Bond' after so many 'throw it in your face films' was refreshing.About the only thing missing from 'Casino Royale' was Q and his many nifty gadgets. Other than that, the action lives up to the Bond name and this one even has a semi-intriguing plot with a few twists (yay!).Basically, although I would have probably gone on seeing Bond movies forever, the franchise had gotten a bit stale towards the end of Brosnan's run (e.g. Die Another Day). Thus, going back in time (with a new Bond actor) to tell a different type of story (more grit than flash) was a welcome diversion that put the 'juice' back into my Bond fan-ship once again.Unless you are a very nit-picky Bond fan or one that thoroughly enjoys the old conventions exactly as they were, 'Casino Royale' will shoot straight to the top of your 'Best Bond Film Ever' list.",10,1,5,10 March 2017
Toy Story 3," All About Relevant Themes
","Besides the humor and crazy adventure, the thing that has really made the Toy Story franchise successful is its focus on very relevant childhood themes. In part one, it was the new toy (Buzz) challenging the viability of the old one (Woody). Part two is more of an origins tale. The trend continues in part three, this time dealing with the growing-up of toy owner Andy.For a basic plot summary, Toy Story 3 sees the toybox gang (led as usual by Woody the Cowboy and Buzz the Space Ranger) trying to deal with Andy going away to college. When some of the toys panic in thinking they will end up in the city refuse, they 'escape' to a local daycare, where life seems to be fine. However, the idyllic daycare future (where toys always get played with) may not be as rosy as it seems, forcing the toys to make some tough decisions about returning to Andy or moving on with their lives.All the good stuff that made the franchise what it is today is present in this film: the strong lead characters, the wise-cracking 'peanut gallery' of supporting characters, and the hilarious sight gags that will thrill both young and old. Also, the animation is slicker than ever (compare technology from the mid-90s to today and you'll get the picture), bringing the characters and their rich environments to live in even more vivid clarity.However, what really sets this film apart from other Pixar fare is its attention to themes that tug at everyone's heartstrings. The toys struggle with their loyalty to Andy (who has inevitably outgrown them) vs. their desire to still be played with (every toy's greatest joy). At times, you might wonder just why exactly you are misting end (especially towards the end) about chunks of plastic animated on screen, but then you'll remember: Because they DO mean something to you, as they share the same struggles as normal people. Unlike perhaps any other children's film franchise in history, Toy Story really creates an unbreakable emotional bond between 'actors' and audience.If this is indeed the final chapter in the Toy Story saga (and the ending, while emotional, leaves some wiggle room for the future), it went out on the highest of possible notes. It will make you laugh, cry, cheer, and, perhaps most importantly: FEEL.",9,1,2,10 March 2017
Space Jam," A Nostalgic Landmark For Those Who 'Lived It'
","Most people consider 'Toy Story' to be the animated movie that bridged the 'playful kiddie stuff' with 'sophisticated adult appeal' to produce a product that all could enjoy. However, I think that sometimes this quirky little gem is overlooked in the pantheon of animated fare as it shares many of those same 'Toy Story' traits.For a basic plot summary, 'Space Jam' sees 'former' (during his 'baseball years') NBA great Michael Jordan (played by himself, of course!) join forces with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and all the other Looney Tunes gang to play a b-ball games against the evil minions of Swackhammer of Moron Mountain in Toon Land.The reason this film works so well is two-fold:First, it is just a great kid's movie. I mean, what kid doesn't like the Looney Tunes, right?! There are enough crazy antics to keep most kids entertained for the runtime.The true hallmark of the film, though, is how well it stands up to 'nostalgia viewers' like myself, or those who saw it 'live' back in 1996. 'Space Jam' took full advantage of Michael Jordan's mystique (back when the NBA was relevant to everyone and still fighting the NFL for popularity), added some great music, and even capitalized on Jordan's retirement by making it a plot point.Simply put, 'Space Jam' may be somewhat of a forgotten effort due to basketball's waning popularity, the time gone by after Jordan, and the fact that even the Looney Tunes themselves are no longer as popular as they once were. However, the cultural significance of this movie (for those who 'lived it') cannot be ignored. When Jordan is flying around the court and 'I Believe I Can Fly' is crooning in the background, this is pure magic for the nostalgic set.",10,2,4,7 March 2017
Signs," M. Night In His Prime
","Coming off of 'The Sixth Sense' & 'Unbreakable', filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan was in the prime of his 'pull the wool over our eyes' type of films. It sure shows in this gem of a film dealing with both aliens and the question of 'fate vs. coincidence'.For a basic plot summary, 'Signs' sees Rev. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), brother Merrill (Joaquin Phoenix), son Morgan (Rory Caulkin), and daughter Bo (Abigail Breslin) suddenly dealing with an alien presence, begun by a strange crop circle on the nearby property. This comes on he heels of the death of the mother of the family, so the remaining family members struggle to deal with this new test.What makes this movie so great is that, short of 'Sixth Sense', it is the best 'trick ending' of any M. Night film. I won't say any more for fear of spoiling it for you, but suffice it to say that your jaw will be on the floor (provided you are 'going in blind', of course, without any prior knowledge). The ending even fits in with the context of the overall film, which is an area in which it surpasses later works such as 'The Village' & 'Lady In The Water'.The acting is also terrific, with Gibson giving a poignant performance as the faithless former preacher. Phoenix and the children characters provide some much-needed comic relief in such a dark (and sometimes emotionally dreary) film. As usual, one of M. Night's most underrated directorial talents shines through: the ability to change the mood of a piece on a dime, perfectly blending satire with mystery/adventure without either getting stale.Overall, 'Signs' is a wonderful movie if you are a fan of mysteries or sci-fi tales. It even has the 'human touch' to vault it into all-time favorite status. Incredibly, after fooling us already with 'Sixth Sense', M. Night turns around a scant few years later and turns the exact same trick. Remarkable.",10,4,8,7 March 2017
Pitch Perfect 3," A Severely Missed Opportunity
","'Pitch Perfect' is a franchise that really shouldn't succeed even close to the levels it reaches. Yet, it manages to grab from just enough audiences to prove itself viable most of the time. It has the 'girl power' audience, the audience that loves the raunchy humor/wisecracks, and of course the well-choreographed song/dance numbers. Throw in just enough of a story, and you've got something.The first 'Pitch Perfect' film was all about the transition to college and branching out in the world. 'Pitch Perfect 2' was about diving deeper into that experience and bonding with friends. Though never in line for an Oscar nomination, a story arc was indeed in play here. 'Pitch Perfect 3' was supposed to be about coming together after college is over and being a bit lost in life (as many young people feel at this point in time). Sadly, that opportunity is wasted by a script that doesn't try nearly as hard as it should to continue the story arc. What results is a jumbled mess, punctuated by just enough musical numbers to keep it watchable for even the hard-core fans.For a basic plot summary, 'PP3' sees Beca (Anna Kendrick) and the rest of the Bellas (Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Anna Camp, Hailee Steinfeld, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, etc.) struggling to adapt to life outside of the group. They are presented an opportunity, however, to participate in a USO tour to 'support the troops', (as well as perhaps prove themselves to be the opening act for DJ Khaled) and they all jump at the opportunity to sing again.Story-wise, this movie is a mess from start to finish. The USO doesn't really even make that much sense (and keeps changing in plot-device fashion to fit the narrative), no character development takes place, and a subplot involving Fat Amy's father (played by John Lithgow) is inanely stupid. There is even a confusion of tone, as the writers didn't seem to know what they wanted this movie to be. Is it about the Bellas reuniting and 'finding themselves' again, or is it about acapella music vs. instrumental music? Unfortunately, neither path is definitively taken or resolved.To me, the saddest thing about 'PP3' is that it missed a golden opportunity to 'go out on top', so to speak, as this is a franchise that is not (despite its previous cash-cow status) going to live on forever. It has already lost a lot of that forward momentum. This could have been a great 'final reunion' movie that brings everything back together and to a close. That doesn't happen here, though, as instead the tact was more to just create an average PP film and sort of leave the characters adrift at the conclusion. My guess is that the studio producing these films did not yet want to make an 'ending film' in the series, but I think they will come to regret that decision (this one is not doing well at the box office at all).Overall, then, 'Pitch Perfect 3' was a big disappointment to me. The song numbers are literally all this film has going for it. The rest is a mess, and potentially a long-term mess for this franchise as well. It's too bad that the studio wants to milk it dry, as that is exactly what seems to be happening here. Creatively-speaking, 'PP3' is bone-dry.",3,1,3,28 December 2017
Identity," Not The Movie You Think It Is
","AT face value, the conceit of this film seems like the set-up for every suspense picture ever made: A dark and stormy night, a collection of characters who congregate at a gloomy motel, and one by one they start dying off. While the film performs well inside of that characterization, it forgoes the traditional 'reveal of the killer' in the end in favor of a much more mind-bending conclusion.To not spoil things for the masses, the amazing twist near the end is roughly akin to what the TV show LOST has done over the span of six years. When LOST first started, creator JJ Abrams tricked us into thinking it was a show about a group of plane crash-ees trying to survive on an island. Six years later, the show is dealing with time-travel and the entire fate of civilization. Though 'Identity' doesn't quite go THAT far, it follows a similar tract by not even closely resembling (at the end) the movie you thought you were watching in the beginning.What keeps this movie from just being a curiosity, though, is that even after the jaw-dropping reveal, it still manages to wrap up the pseudo-plot line quite nicely. Basically, you can still be satisfied with the film even if the shocking ending doesn't do it for you.Thus, if you are a fan of mystery/suspense thrillers and revel in big twists at the end, you will watch almost the entire final credits in a state of shock. Plus, even if you don't like huge plot surprises, the 'fake' storyline will still keep you on the edge of your seat.",9,1,1,12 March 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," Maybe The Best Movie I've Seen All Year
","As a child, one of my favorite movies was always 'Mary Poppins'. Being young, I obviously couldn't articulate exactly WHY I liked it so much (I'm sure the catchy music had a lot to do with it), but I wore a tract in the VCR with it, that is for sure. After seeing 'Saving Mr. Banks', however, I was astounding to realize perhaps part of the reason why 'Mary Poppins' stands the test of time: because the message behind it is one born out of real-life issues.For a basic plot summary, 'Saving Mr. Banks' focuses on P.L. Travers (Emma Thompson), writer of the 'Mary Poppins' children's novel. For 20 years, Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) has been pursuing the rights to make the book into a movie, finally culminating in him flying Travers to Los Angeles to begin work on the project. When Travers wants full creative control and clashes monumentally with Disney's version of the film, it is revealed (via flashbacks) how personal the Poppins story truly is to Travers.The reason why this movie is so touching and genuine is because it works on two different levels:On one hand, it brings back incredible nostalgia for fans of Disney's 'Mary Poppins'. Just hearing the iconic music again and seeing how key plot/character points came together is exciting.On the other hand, those (though probably few and far between) who haven't seen the movie will still be intrigued by the fascinating backstory of P.L. Travers. More specifically, the role her father (played by Colin Farrell) played in her life and how that relationship shaped her persona even into adulthood. Some fascinating human dynamics that prove out the old 'truth is stranger than fiction' maxim.The hallmark of 'Saving Mr. Banks', though, is its ability to have audiences laughing, crying, singing, and feeling all in the span of two hours. The complex characters, catchy tunes, and use of flashbacks prove a potent mixture of drama and fun. This is truly a film for the entire family.Until recently, 'Prisoners' had been cemented atop my 'Best Movie of 2013' list. 'Saving Mr. Banks', however, is just as good, if only in a completely different way. I'm sure I'll enjoy some more genre Hollywood fare this holiday season ('Hobbit 2', 'Anchorman 2', 'Grudge Match', etc.), but I have a feeling that when all is said and done, this one will still be at the top of the heap.",10,3,3,4 March 2017
Live Free or Die Hard," A Crisis Worthy Of John McClane
","Bruce Willis (and the Die Hard franchise he perpetuated) will always be judged next to the other famous action franchises of the 1980s, such as 'Rocky', 'Rambo', & 'The Terminator'. While all those series got re-booted in the 2000s, they also contained a heavy dose of nostalgia for the past. In 'Live Free or Die Hard', however, it is 'full steam ahead' with little time for remembrance.For a basic plot summary, 'Live Free' sees John McClane (Willis) pulled into another tense criminal situation when villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Oliphant) executes an event of cyber- terrorism severe enough to bring Washington to its knees. Along with 'hack-boy' Matt Farrell (Justin Long), McClane sets out to find the perpetrators and bring them some 1980s-style justice.This film really works primarily due to airtight direction & pacing. Director Len Wiseman never lets the pace flag whatsoever. When the action dies down, the wisecracks & humor ramps up. Suffice it to say that there is never a boring moment what with all the action, chases, explosions, technology, & typical Willis humor.The main plot ('cyber-terrorism') also serves to usher McClane into the 21st century. McClane's old-school justice provides a nice counterpoint to the tech-nerd played by Long (who is actually, on a rare occasion, watchable in this effort).Actually, the only negative thing I can say about this movie is that I almost wished it would have harkened back to the themes of the original even perhaps a bit more. There is a subplot involving the daughter of McClane, but little more is mentioned (besides a few 'easter egg moments') regarding the original Die Hard trilogy.Overall, though, 'Live Free' is a great addition to the Die Hard cannon (already better than parts two & three). For an action-oriented film, it really holds its weight.",7,2,2,11 March 2017
The Sixth Sense," The Way Cinema Is Supposed To Work
","Is there such a thing as a 'perfect movie'? If that concept does indeed exist, than 'The Sixth Sense' comes about as close as possibly to taking that prize. It contains everything one could ask for in a film.For a basic plot summary, 'The Sixth Sense' tells the story of young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), who is prone to visions of dead ghosts and as such is not fitting in very well at school or at home. With the help of a very unique child psychologist named Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), however, Cole is finally able to face his fears and begin to move on with his life.Since it is easier to come at this review from this angle, about the only people who WON'T enjoy this movie are those who only like the mindless actions of explosions, car chases, and flexing muscles. Not to disparage those films or their audiences, but if that is the only kind of fare that gets you revved up in the theater, then this one might not be for you.For everyone else, though, 'Sixth Sense' is almost a clinic in how to make a movie that will keep the audience engaging in nearly every way possible. It is the kind of film that one cannot say too much about or risk major spoilers, but suffice it to say that it is filled with mystery, layer upon layer of plots, terrific acting, suspense, and a jaw-dropping finale that will have you rebooting the whole experience again very soon! Though perhaps not by a humongous margin (as 'Signs' is excellent in its own right), 'Sixth Sense' is the hallmark film from director M. Night Shyamalan, as it is the perfect showcase for the type of movies he enjoyed making.Overall, this film is easily in my Top Ten Films of All-Time mental list, and perhaps even encroaching on the Top Five. It is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word. If for some reason you haven't seen it, it may just fundamentally change the way you view cinema forever.",10,3,4,4 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Make Sure You See It A Second Time...Trust Me
","Seeing a new Star Wars movie is a big deal. It should be filled with great special effects, a compelling story, and intriguing characters. 'The Force Awakens' hits all of those marks, providing a very entertaining viewing experience. However, as Old Biff might say in Back To The Future 2: 'There's something very familiar about all of this'.For a basic plot summary, 'The Force Awakens' introduces a number of new characters to the Star Wars universe and has multiple plot threads interacting with each other simultaneously. It is set roughly 30 years after the events of 'Return of the Jedi'. I want to talk about the characters more specifically, so suffice it to say that the main plot lines center on these two ideas: -Springing from the ruins of the Galactic Empire, the New Order is consolidating power once again in a era where the Jedi are not a force to be reckoned with. In this film, the New Order is nearing completion of a solar-powered weapon that take take out multiple planets in a single burst. On the brunt end of that force? The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), a similar offshoot of the Rebel Alliance doing everything in their power to avoid the First Order getting any stronger. -While the battles wage on in the air, a more personal quest is undertaken by many to find the map to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a Jedi who has not been heard from in quite some time.There are many things that 'Force Awakens' does right. I could write pages and pages of character description and highlights, but for the sake of brevity and spoilers, I'll just hit the highlights: -It 'feels like a Star Wars movie' in its epic scale. I was entertained pretty much from beginning to end. -It introduces new characters expertly. Solitary orphan Rey (Daisy Ridley), storm-trooper- turned-Resistance-sympathizer Finn (John Boyega), and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are all intriguing and immediately have a sense of gravitas about them. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is also introduced, but he plays a much smaller role (with the potential to grow). The same can be said for the mysterious Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong'o) and Supreme Leader Snoke (Andy Serkis) -The 'winks and nods' to the IV-VI trilogy are all over the place. From the return of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) aboard the Millennium Falcon, to some old droid friends, and even a lightsaber steeped in mythological significance, this film isn't shy in the least about hearkening back to the 'good old days' of the original trilogy.No doubt about it, this is a very entertaining, dramatic, and visually appealing Star Wars film.Here's the problem, though, and the reason I can't give it the full star complement: To me, at least, it seemed a bit too derivative of 'A New Hope' in terms of plot. 'Large evil force builds unstoppable weapon that can only be defeated by a band of X-Wings by targeting a single location'. Where have we heard that before? Even Rey being introduced out in the desert is very reminiscent of Luke's original family at the beginning of Episode IV. For a movie that does so well about developing new characters, re-introducing old ones, and continuing the important story lines, one has to wonder why certain parts are so derivative of what came before.If I had to guess, I would say that hearkening so heavily back to the original trilogy was a way of establishing that this one was going to distance itself as far as possible from the controversial prequels. I find the prequels to have value, but many (most?) Star Wars fans don't share that point of view. So, perhaps this return to the conventions of the original trilogy is the greatest possible scenario for many fans. I was just a bit disappointed that a mind as creative as JJ Abrams' is couldn't think of something a little more original to represent the New Order/Resistance conflict.Of course, there is also very much a sense of 'delayed gratification' aspect of this film, as it is primarily setup. Many new ideas are thrown around and very few of them are expounded upon. There is a tantalizing teaser of a final scene that hopefully sets up a dynamite Episode VIII, but as I sit right now there are many unanswered questions. That's probably a good thing for the first third of a trilogy, but it just pushes 'final judgment' out further to see if this setup will really payoff. I hope so.Overall, 'The Force Awakens' was a very entertaining movie that will enthrall Star Wars diehards and make millions of new, young fans too. I had fun watching it. I just can't give it that 'classic' stamp of approval because of that lingering sensation that so many plot devices were taken from 'A New Hope'. Perhaps a second viewing will change my perspective (update: it did...for the better!).",9,11,29,28 February 2017
Flight," Realistic To Its Own Detriment
","The funny thing about the cinematic experience sometimes is that, for all that moviegoers seem to want more 'realism' on the big screen (e.g. the dark, gritty, 'Dark Knight' series, a movie completely steeped in reality falls a bit short. Why? Because, generally speaking, we go to the cinema to ESCAPE our own realities, not get sucked up in them once again. Thus, for all the good things that 'Flight' accomplishes, it is just too 'grounded' to ever real produce the kind of emotional response needed to make it truly great.For a basic plot summary (containing some minor spoilers), 'Flight' sees pilot Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) perform an incredible feat of flying by landing a large commercial airliner that is literally falling apart around him. The only problem? Mr. Whitaker is an alcoholic who also uses cocaine to 'rev himself back up' and continue flying. When both substances are found on his toxicology report after the crash, Whip embarks on a personal journey that ultimately ends with him confronting his own personal demons.There are some things that this film does very well. The direction from Robert Zemeckis is sound, Denzel turns in a great performance, and the airplane sequences are absolutely captivating. The plot and auxiliary characters are also just good enough to make it a solid effort despite my biggest critique:I have never viewed a film so down-to-earth and utterly devoid of an ounce of contrived drama. Usually that is a good thing (as so many films go the opposite route), but in this case it just makes for a flick that doesn't really arouse any deep emotions or feelings towards the on-screen proceedings. Every step of Whip's journey is laid out for us, there are no surprises, and even the moments that could have been filled with drama are instead a bit anti-climactic because they have already been explained to us.Overall, then, I can't rank 'Flight' as anything significantly better than average. It is a good role for Denzel, but other than that it just fails to capture any emotion enough to be a huge success.",5,1,2,6 March 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A Spectacular Rendering Of The Source Material
","The ending of J.K. Rowling's 'Deathly Hallows' novel is a wonderful way to bring to close such an epic series of this order. In this film, director David Yates manages to translate all of those same emotions to the big screen to really re-create the magic of Rowling's pen into visual form.For a basic plot summary, 'Deathly Hallows 2' produces the endgame of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) plan to rule the wizarding world. While Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) close in on the last Horcruxes, the students and teachers of Hogwarts must defend their territory in the face of constant Death Eater assault. As the final battle for the school rages, Harry (as is his destiny, made even clearer by a pensieve trip into the memories of Severus Snape (Alan Rickman)), must face Voldemort alone to decide their fate.Like 'Deathly Hallows 1', this movie is allowed enough time to focus on the details of the story without it feeling rushed or excising parts altogether. In Rowling's 'Potter Endgame', pretty much every page has some sort of meaning, and this film is able to explore those events/emotions with the care they deserve.It also helps that 'DH 2' showcases some of the best acting of the entire series. The lead trio have perfected their roles by this point, and the auxiliary cast is now so large and deep that every interaction seems like a true happening.Overall, this big-screen finale to the Harry Potter franchise is exactly what you would want in a based-on-the-novel scenario: it stays true to the source material while at the same time translating it into visual drama instead of imagined or 'thought' drama.",9,1,2,6 March 2017
Unbroken," A Soulless Film Devoid Of Any Meaning (And That's Really A Shame)
","When I read Laura Hillenbrand's 'Unbroken' novel, it was a visceral experience...perhaps the most power non-fiction book I've read in my entire life. I'll never forget the name Louis Zamperini because of it. Sadly, this film adaptation of Louis' story tells only the most generic form of the story possible. All the real emotion and raw power of the story is excised.For a basic plot summary, 'Unbroken' is the story of Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), an Olympic runner who joins the military (eventually becoming a bombardier) to serve his country during World War II. While on a rescue mission, Louis' plane is shot down, forcing he and two fellow soldiers to spend over a month on a floating life-raft. They are finally rescued...by the Japanese military, who bring them to a camp occupied by a sadistic leader known as 'The Bird' (Takamasa Ishihara). A trip through the coal mines also ensues, and Louis has multiple occasions where he could be nearing his mental and physical breaking point.The reason 'Unbroken' fails so miserably, however, is that my brief description above is actually more exciting than anything that happens in the film itself. Basically, it is just a 'collection of events' in a general sense. One thing happens, then another thing happens, and so on and so forth. The emotional underpinnings that tie all the events together in the novel are completely absent. I'm not exactly sure why this is (especially with a screenplay written by the usually-solid Coen Brothers), but it likely comes from the direction of second-time director Angelina Jolie. Either Jolie cut out the meat of the story due to her own personal biases, or she just isn't polished enough yet behind the camera to know exactly what she is doing. Either way, the result is a film without a soul.Also not helping this effort is that there is not a single truly great acting performance to be found. O'Connell as Louis is 'just okay', but even then there doesn't seem to be much brewing underneath the surface of the performance. None of the supporting cast stick out whatsoever.One final glaring mistake: Jolie chooses to not cover (besides a few captions at the end) the end of Zamperini's life which, to me, is the most emotional hard-hitting part of the whole story. In case you haven't read the novel, this is where Louis struggles with terrible post-traumatic stress and basically hits rock bottom in alcoholism. After joining a Billy Graham crusade and giving his life to Christianity, he then makes a journey back to Japan to try and find 'The Bird' and come to terms with his wartime experiences. To not show this in the film is a crime, IMHO.Viewing this movie was actually quite sad to me, as I know how much better it could have been made. If this version of the story is the only time you hear about Louis Zamperini, it will fade from your memory rather quickly, a shame considering how truly inspiring the man's story is. Instead of diving headfirst into the gritty, visceral issues that shape Louis' story, Jolie pulls too many punches and tries to create almost a family-film environment (released over the holidays, very little actual war violence compared to actual events, etc). This creates the most general movie experience possible, I have no respect for that approach to film-making.",2,2,4,4 March 2017
Rear Window," Hitch Breaks New Ground Again
","By today's standards, a film like 'Rear Window' would seem quite uninspired, unoriginal, and just plain derivative (see: Disturbia). However, when one considers that Hitchcock's 'Window' actually SET the standard, it really can be considered a groundbreaking film.For a basic plot summary, 'Rear Window' sees photographer L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) laid up with a broken leg, with nothing else to do but stare out the window at the activities of his city- dwelling neighbors. One neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) in particular, though, arouses the interest of Jeffries due to his strange behavior and disappearing wife. At first, things seem relatively harmless, until Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) gets pulled into the proceedings, making things a whole lot more personal.Once again, this movie shows just how far ahead of the game Alfred Hitchcock was compared to other directors of his time. In 1954, while other directors were cranking out B-pictures, character flicks, or even 'variety show' events that did nothing more than draw crowds, Hitch was crafting a spooky tale of voyeurism that still holds up very well to this day. The directing is fantastic, as Hitch slowly builds the tension to a few scenes towards the end that will make your blood run cold.The acting is also top-notch. You can't go wrong with Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly shows that she isn't just a 'pretty face' as well. Raymond Burr (though only uttering a few lines of dialogue) is also intriguing as the antagonist throughout.About the only criticism I have of this film (what drops it from a 5-star to 4-star rating) is that Hitch puts in some character development just for the sake of character development...it doesn't really lead anywhere. A full 20 minutes could have been cut out in relation to character-building, and the overall product might have been more exciting/better paced.Overall, though, this is a great movie that truly stands the test of time. Immerse yourself in Hitchcock's original fare and see the master at his best.",9,1,2,11 March 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The End Of The Epic
","The intensely satisfying emotions stirred by the writing of J.R.R. Tolkien are delivered via an epic quest by all creatures (men, hobbits, elves, orcs, and the like) of Middle Earth. Well, every quest must have a conclusion, and director Peter Jackson adapts Tolkien's final chapter of the trilogy onto the big screen just as triumphantly as the first two installments.For a basic plot summary, 'Return of the King' sees the two primary plot-lines of the entire trilogy reach their apex:-On one front, Frodo, Sam, & Gollum/Smeagle finally reach Mordor, but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at their journey's end.-In the world of men, Aragorn (with Gandalf's help) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions. Along for the ride again is the feisty dwarf Gimli, Legolas the marksman Elf, & hobbits Merry & Pippin doing the best they can to contribute to the cause.Simply put, 'Return of the King' is no better or worse than the preceding movies. It is just the continuation of perhaps the most incredible fantasy fiction (translated here to the big screen) series of all-time, and incredibly well-done at that.What really stands out with this particular third chapter, however, is the last half hour or so of run-time, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some emotionally rousing scenes. Because the characters are so real, so full of life, and have been through so much, you will feel as if it has been your quest all along, making those parting emotions feel all the more raw/real. Let's just say the eyes might get a little misty on more than one occasion.Thus, 'Return of the King' is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful book-to-film translation. It has everything that a movie-goer could possibly want: action, adventure, drama, humor, and most of all...heart.",9,0,0,8 March 2017
The Purge," Such A Novel Idea Wasted On What Turns Into Stock Horror Fare
","For its first 30 minutes or so, 'The Purge' is one of the most inventive, fresh movies of the entire year. At about that point, however, it is as if director James DeMonaco thought 'oh wait...this is supposed to be a horror movie' and thus the creative juices dwindle down into pretty much stock horror fare.For a basic plot summary, 'The Purge' sets the stage of America circa. 2022, where on one night each year all crime (even homicide) is legal. Supposedly, this 'simple' government action has led to the lowest levels of unemployment and general violence in history the other 364 days. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke), wife Mary (Lena Headey) and their two children (Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane) plan to ride out the night inside their fortified-shelter home, until a homeless man requesting aid gives their night a completely unexpected twist.The concept behind 'The Purge' truly is an incredible one, and thus contains the backbone of the entire storyline (or, at least, SHOULD). Enough dialogue (in various formats) is given about the event that the viewer will actually be intrigued instead of instantly dismissing the concept as a 'gimmick'. While watching, you'll actually be thinking through some pretty deep societal messages/themes (gasp...at a horror movie!).Sadly, once the 'Purge' event in the film commences, the movie slowly turns into much more traditional 'jump' and 'blood' horror movie fare. All those great themes established in the opening sequences are thrown away in favor of chases and contrived scares.Thus, there are two ways to look at a movie like this. On one hand, it accomplishes a great feat by taking some extraordinary themes of humanity and sticking them in a 'scary movie'. On the other hand, the film still couldn't be genre-diverse enough to resist going back to the 'old standards' of horror in the end and wasting such great development.",4,3,4,5 March 2017
Pitch Perfect," This Movie Is Beneath Anna Kendrick
","Despite the fact that 'Pitch Perfect' doesn't exactly fall into my preferred film genre, I rented it because I have thoroughly enjoyed previous flicks featuring Anna Kendrick ('Up In The Air', '50/50') and figured that her presence in this one might lend it more legitimacy. Unfortunately, all it did was leave me wondering why Kendrick would lend her presence to such a clichéd, pointless film.For a basic plot summary, 'Pitch Perfect' sees college newbie Becca (Kendrick) trying to fit in at her new campus while also pursuing a potential career as a music DJ. On some advice from her father, Becca joins a collegiate a cappella singing group in hopes of making friends and living the 'college life'.The glaring weakness of this film is that director Jason Moore should have made it a bit more of a serious effort in accordance with Kendrick's acting style. Usually, Kendrick is so cute and likable that audiences cannot help but sympathize and identify with her. In 'Pitch Perfect', though, all the crazy proceedings around Kendrick's characters are too ridiculous to even let the audiences think they should be taking themselves seriously whatsoever.Basically, I just wonder why-oh-why did the film's producers try to follow the 'Bring It On' cheerleading-esque approach to this movie. Rebel Wilson's 'Fat Amy' character is about the only semblance of the film that actually made me laugh a time or two. Otherwise, it is just a collection of shock humor (vomit jokes run the course of the movie) and sight gags.The only reason I give 'Pitch Perfect' two stars is because the musical numbers are fun and some of 'Fat Amy's' one-liners are legitimately hilarious. However, unless you REALLY, REALLY enjoyed the 'Bring It On' style of making a movie, you'll want to discard this one fairly quickly from your film library.",4,2,3,6 March 2017
The Truman Show," A Film Ahead Of Its Time
","When 'The Truman Show' hit theaters in the summer of 1998, there was no such thing as reality TV. 'Survivor', 'Big Brother', 'Amazing Race', or 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians'? All in the future. The fact that this film beat America to the reality-TV punch shows how much of a landmark production it truly was--ahead of its time, to be sure.For a basic plot summary, 'The Truman Show' tells the story of Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), a seemingly regular guy who begins to suspect that his life is being controlled by forces outside of his own. As it turns out, his life (from birth) has been viewed by the TV-watching public since birth, with everyone in on the idea except him. That includes his wife (Laura Linney), best friend (Noah Emmerich), and even an old flame (Natascha McElhone) intent on revealing the mystery once Truman starts putting the pieces together and ultimately discovers how manipulated his life truly is. But not if enigmatic director Christof (Ed Harris) has anything to say about it.'Truman Show' is a concept movie through-and-through. It really nails the concept of 'reality TV' & just how pervasive commercialism can become in our society. As previously mentioned, this film was years ahead of its time in portraying such issues. As such, in way the experience actually resonates more today than it ever could have in '98.The acting helps the production rise above just the concept as well. Carrey completely and utterly sheds his more farcical comedic roles and turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as the befuddled Truman, while the auxiliary roles are finely-tuned as well. Director Peter Weir will have you truly caring about the little town of Seahaven Island and its inhabitants by the film's conclusion.I consider 'The Truman Show' to be one of the finest films of all-time. It has everything a great movie needs...intriguing plot, good pacing, solid acting, investing characters, and even a little humor thrown in here and there. Not only does it work on its surface level, but it also expertly presages a digital, commercialist, voyeuristic culture--all avenues that seemed to be moving closer to a societal reality.",10,2,2,10 March 2017
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Style Improves & Still True To Book
","The first 'Hunger Games' movie's popularity to each person ran roughly equal to their enjoyment of the written works. Essentially, how much you liked/disliked the book was exactly how much you liked/disliked the movie. With 'Catching Fire', however, director Francis Lawrence actually turns in what may very well be a superior product to Suzanne Collins' tome.For a basic plot summary, 'Catching Fire' sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) back from their original Hunger Games experience now living on 'Panem's dime' while on the promotional tour for the next games. When President Snow (Donald Sutherland) doesn't like the symbol that Katniss may be turning into, he rigs the upcoming Quarter Quell (75th edition of the Games) with a special new set of rules unprecedented in the history of the event.While the first 'Hunger Games' movie was impressive in its own right, I believe that 'Catching Fire' is superior because it is a bit more 'versatile'. The original movie was very dark in tone and serious throughout. I have read all the books, so I completely realized that the tone is quite serious, but I really appreciated the lighter moments of 'Catching Fire', those moments when I felt like it was okay to laugh or smile at something that was transpiring.The main cog in making the machine work is Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Other great performances from characters like Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), and Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) are packed with subtle nuances all their own, but it is truly Lawrence who holds this whole thing together. Her screen presence alone is a force to be reckoned with. Even if her portrayal of Katniss is quite a bit different (at least physical) from how she is portrayed in the books, Lawrence has easily made the character entirely her own.Thus, while the first movie in this series whetted my appetite for more, 'Catching Fire' satiated the hunger by mixing some brevity and wit into some deadly serious subject matter. It changes the style of the series-so-far while also staying pretty true to the source material.",9,2,3,5 March 2017
The Matrix," The Greatest Science Fiction Movie EVER?
","'Wake Up, Neo'.With those three seemingly simple words, the entire concept of the Matrix is born. Part science fiction, part philosophical musing, part action-adventure, 'The Matrix' is, pure and simple, the most well-crafted science fiction film of all-time.The film, set in a human future where machines control the human race and use humans much like we currently use batteries, centers on the fate of one man, Neo (Keanu Reeves), who is awakened to this terrible existence. Much like the viewers of the film, Neo must figure out what is real and what is not, who to believe and who to fight.The real gem hidden within this film, however, is its commentary on the CURRENT human condition, or specifically how we continue to design smarter and smarter machines that may one day be our downfall. Plus, the absolutely unbelievable/horrible future that awaits us is so unforgiving that viewers can't help but cheer for the protagonists, even if we will go back to our AI the next day at work.The acting in this movie has been much-maligned, but the characters (while truly not very emotive) are almost MEANT to have a sort of philosophical tone to them. Neo is the confused savior, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is the unflappable leader, and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is the experienced sidekick. Also, the villainous 'Agent Smith' (Hugo Weaving) will make you want to see him absolutely annihilated (the sign of a truly good villain!).Of course, the special effects in this film are absolutely stunning, what with the use of 'Bullet Time' (where the lightning action is slowed down to minuscule movements without losing any clarity).Overall, this is a masterpiece science fiction film, combining an extraordinarily engaging plot, very able-bodied protagonists and antagonists, as well as special effects that, at the time of the film's release, were cutting edge. So, if you are looking for a film that will have you deep in contemplation days after viewing, but will also make you say 'Whoa' (to quote Neo) while viewing, this film is for you.",10,1,2,12 March 2017
Looper," Willis Gets Time Travel Right Again
","Back in 1995, Bruce Willis starred in a movie ('12 Monkeys') that managed to do what most time-travel movies cannot: make even a modicum of sense. In 'Looper', Willis (this time sharing the screen with Joseph Gordon-Levitt) once again gets time-travel right.For a basic plot summary, 'Looper' is set in a future where time travel isn't invented yet...but will be in thirty years, primarily used by the mob to get rid of their 'dirty laundry'. Each day, Joe (Gordon-Levitt) waits in a field and guns down time-looping individuals as they appear. One day, however, Joe must 'close the loop' on himself by killing the older version of himself (Willis). When the time comes, though, Young Joe hesitates and Old Joe does not, leading to an interesting scenario filled with astounding possibilities.Where 'Looper' primarily succeeds (like '12 Monkeys' before it) is that it perfectly walks the fine line of successful time travel fiction: it doesn't come off as hokey, yet it doesn't spend too much time deconstructing the science involved. This is a story about people and their relationships, with the time travel being the vehicle towards that end. It also gives the viewing mind a lot to think about.Only helping matters is the acting of the two leads. It is absolutely astounding how Gordon-Levitt was made to look like a young Willis. He is almost unrecognizable from his previously roles in films like 'Inception' or 'Dark Knight Rises'. Their chemistry with each other is both intense and interesting, a fact that is only bolstered by the fact that they are one in the same person!Overall, 'Looper' is just a well thought-out time-travel flick that also packs a ton of drama and character emotion. High praise must be given to director Rian Johnson for making what can be a maddening subject into a coherent screenplay. It makes you think, makes you feel, and always keeps you guessing as to what will happen next.",9,2,3,6 March 2017
Heat," Doesn't Live Up To The Billing
","As a fan of Al Pacino's 'later years' works, this seemed to be a gaping hole in my viewing of his films. When the film concluded after nearly three hours, however, I was left feeling severely disappointed by a whole slew of things in 'Heat'.For a basic plot summary, 'Heat' sees Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) square off against notorious big-time criminal Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). As a sort of cat-and-mouse game emerges between those two leads, a secondary plot line focuses on one of De Niro's henchman (played by Val Kilmer).The #1 problem with this movie is simply that the story isn't anything to write home about. In fact, it is actually a sub-par plot that contains very little emotion or meaningful character development. It is a slow-moving, hard-boiled cop drama...but without any of the usual themes that make those types of movies watchable.Also, what really puts the nail in the coffin is that the acting (what should be the flick's strong suit) is also poor. I never thought Pacino could possible over-act a role, but he does here, while De Niro is pretty much just stoic throughout. I know those two can do much better, but this was just not a great vehicle for them to shine.I even considered giving 'Heat' the dreaded one-star rating, but it isn't quite bad enough for that. There is one captivating scene involving Pacino/De Niro, and the plot is more recycled/dull than outright horrible.Basically, 'Heat' is nowhere near the 'epic cop drama' it is billed as. I would say go out a get 'Righteous Kill' if you want to see a better Pacino/De Niro pairing. While that movie is only average in its own right, it still surpasses this bloated marathon.",3,6,12,9 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Sense Of Something Epic
","There was science fiction before Star Wars and science fiction afterwards. The amazing thing about this film, though, is that it presents such a simple narrative. It has drama, compelling characters, action, adventure, humor, and fantasy; every ingredient that an epic doth make.The storyline is classic 'good vs. evil' fare. The Empire forces, commanded by the mechanically- supported Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), wreak havoc over the galaxy, but are opposed by a rebel force led by Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford).While recently watching this movie again, I identified three reasons why this simple little film sparked such a phenomenon:1. The storyline is just so compelling and dramatic. A sense of something epic prevails throughout the entire production.2. Whereas it too preceding show Star Trek many episodes to establish a cadre of eclectic characters, Star Wars (with the likes of Chewbacca, C3PO, & R2D2) accomplishes the feat in roughly 30 minutes.3. The overall genre-diversity of the experience. I recently screened the film with my 13-year old sister, and she enjoyed it as much as I did but for completely different (e.g. humorous, primarily) reasons. Much like 'Back To The Future', for example, Star Wars attracts viewers from all 'walks' of film genre.Basically, this 'first' (depending on your point of view...!) installment in the series does a great job of establishing the important characters, laying the basis for the epic plot, and just providing some basic entertainment. Very few people will be turned off by it, as it contains seemingly something for everyone.",10,2,3,11 March 2017
Footloose," Great At What It Does
","As one of the few people on this earth who has never laid eyes upon the original 1984 'Footloose', I came into this version with no preconceived notions or expectations. As such, I was pleasantly surprised, although not outright blown away.For a basic plot summary, 'Footloose 2011' is a typical 'teens vs. adults' flick. When a car crash (after a night of partying) kills five high school seniors, their community pastor (played by Dennis Quaid) restricts future teenage rebellious behavior by controlling the town with strict laws/curfews. That is, of course, until his daughter (Julianne Hough) meets the new kid in town from Boston (Kenny Wormald) and the town gets stirred up once again.The prevailing factor in this film experience is that the movie is good at what it does. It provides everything that one expects to see, such as: incredible dancing, popular music, attractive men/women, and teen-centered plots. All those things are accomplished with aplomb.An 'added bonus' is the quality of acting from both the youngsters and adults (especially Quaid) in the film. Though inherently a bit hokey, this movie could have diverged into pure cheeseball without such strong performances.Thus, while I can't give it an enormous star rating because it isn't an outright classic, it is very good at what it does (and if you like that kind of thing, your rating will be much higher). Three and a half stars would probably be a more exact ranking. Simply put, I had a good time watching this flick.",6,1,4,11 March 2017
50_50," You Won't Quite Know How To Feel...And Perhaps That's The Point
","While watching '50/50', I had the strange experience of being an 'outsider looking in' at the events transpiring on the screen. Having never battled cancer myself, I found it difficult to make any judgement on the actions.For a basic plot summary, this movie sees a young man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. As he struggles to cope with the diagnosis & treatment of his disease, he is 'helped along' (in a variety of different ways) by a greenhorn therapist (Anna Kendrick), his smothering mother (Anjelica Huston), and his 'best bud' (Seth Rogen).There are times when this movie seems downright ridiculous and seems to veer from any coherent narrative. However, there are also moments that will bring tears to your eyes. It is a very strange flick in that sense.The reason for the strange-ness? The crazy collection of characters present. Levitt himself proves me than capable of carrying the show, and his relationship with 'Kendrick' provides probably the best moments in the film. But then there are the auxiliary cast, who you will alternately hate and appreciate in equal doses. I'm usually a fan of complex characters, but in '50/50' I would actually use the word 'uneven' to describe them.Thus, I have to give this film a middle-of-the-road rating for now (perhaps at some other point in my life I will appreciate it more/less). It's like those personality tests you take in college that ask you to rate something on a 'scale of 1-5'. When you aren't quite sure how you feel, you give it a three.",5,2,3,10 March 2017
Easy A," The Thinking-Person's 'Mean Girls'
","A few years ago, the movie 'Mean Girls' redefined 'high school experience' movies. With 'Easy A', the 'bubblegum' style of 'Mean Girls' is replaced with a bit more of a sophisticated style.For a basic plot summary, 'Easy A' focuses on high school student Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), who inadvertently starts a rumor that she slept with a fellow student. When the rumor spreads like wildfire and Olive realizes she cannot contain it, she decides to just go with it and see what happens.When it comes right down to it, 'Easy A' strikes a nice balance between ridiculous & cute. At some points you'll just be laughing at Olive's crazy antics, while at other times you might just actually care about her character (a rare feat in a primarily comedic effort).Also, it must be mentioned here that Emma Stone's performance as Olive carries this entire movie. Stone can play sexy, sweet, and everything in between, and her range is on full display in this flick. She is a joy to watch and redeems a plot that gets a bit thin after about the first hour.Overall, 'Easy A' is a fun movie if you are interested in high school fare. It tries to be witty, snarky, cute, & even a bit preachy all wrapped up in a single package and, while perhaps not accomplishing any one of those things totally, the combination is enough to warrant a viewing.",7,1,1,9 March 2017
Apollo 13," A Great Film Made At A Strange Time
","'Apollo 13' is a great movie...there is no denying that. It is a great example of how a real-life story can be translated into a great big-screen adaptation and be done right (I'm looking at you, 'Unbroken'). Unfortunately, I think that 'Apollo 13' has gotten a bit of the short shrift over time due to the fact that it was made right on the cusp (1995) of what I consider to be the 'new Hollywood' look.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of the Apollo 13 NASA mission to the Moon. Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Fred Haise (Bill Paxton), and Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) are the astronauts on the mission, with buddy Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise) grounded due to a potential case of the measles. Before the mission shifts into its moon exploration phase, however, an on- board malfunction cripples much of their technology and makes even getting back to Earth a dicey proposition. This is where the on-ground flight coordinator Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and his crew must work their magic in order to bring the three men home and in one piece.Viewing 'Apollo 13' just in terms of story, it is a classic film. There is enough drama in the real- life story to not have to 'mess around' with too many things, and director Ron Howard is easily apt enough to know how to bounce back and forth between action and emotion. This is truly a textbook example of how to adapt real events to the big screen...one of the best I've ever seen in that area. Simply put, this film captures the gravitas of the event, what it did to the men involved in the mission and their families, and grounds the events firmly in 1960s culture in both look and feel.It only helps to have such great acting. Hanks is his usually brilliant self, while Sinise, Bacon, and Paxton are all great auxiliary players. At times, Harris even steals the show as he essentially is forced to do the impossible to bring the men home. Kathleen Quinlan also adds some emotional depth with her turn as Jim Lovell's wife Marilyn.Sadly, despite this being such an exercise in film-making, I think that the timing of the film makes it a bit hard to quantify. Had it been made a couple of years earlier, it would be considered a 'classic' much like Hanks' Forrest Gump (1994). Had it been made a few years later, it would probably get more air time than it does. As it was, however, 'Apollo 13' walks perfectly down that center line between feeling 'old' vs. feeling 'new'. Now don't get me wrong...I'm not saying there is anything wrong with older movies. But this movie just has a strange feel to it because even thought it deals with space and technology, it has that look of being filmed on older film or something like that. I'm sure someone more immersed in film technology could tell me the exact reason why I feel this way.Overall, though, 'Apollo 13' is a great movie that was a joy to watch again having not seen it for a number of years. It is emotional, inspiring, and exciting all at the same time. For an interesting tie-in to the current film culture, I highly recommend it for anyone who really enjoyed 2014's 'Interstellar'. Both films share very similar themes despite being very different in actual content.",Null,1,2,1 March 2017
The Thin Red Line," Sometimes, 'K.I.S.S' Is The Best Method
","When trying to complete any task, the 'K.I.S.S.' method (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is often the most productive. Instead of over-complicating things, the simplest approach is usually the best. In the case of 'The Thin Red Line', however, the film-making is so complicated that it erodes the simpleness of what the motion pictures are trying to convey.For a basic plot summary, this movie centers on the WWII Battle of Guadalcanal. It is basically the story of a bunch of soldiers all over the ranks, from the time they leave the island to the time they leave.This is one of the most complicated films ever made. I wish I could say that makes it good, but it only serves to make it nearly three hours of long stares and boredom. After perusing some Amazon reviews, it is interesting to note the difference between this film and 'Saving Private Ryan', also released in 1998. The supporters of 'Red Line' despise the simpleness of 'Ryan', while those in favor of Spielberg's film lambast Terrance Malick for overblown filmmaking. Here is what I consider to be the difference:'Saving Private Ryan' brought war movies back to the forefront of American filmmaking by connecting late-90s audiences with their 'Greatest Generation' parents or grandparents. Yet, what director Spielberg realized (as he usually does) is that the simplistic approach is the best. He focuses on the travails of just a few characters, doesn't preach or pander, and still manages to create THE film by which all future war epics are judged.'Thin Red Line' tries a completely different approach. It also tries to tell a simple story (Guadalcanal battles), but imbues it with so much philosophic babble and characters that 'say' instead of 'do', that by the end the viewer is so turned around that they won't know what to think. The whole 'horrors of war' theme that Malick leans on so heavily should not need to be explicitly laid out. Trying too long to wrap one's brain around it only serves to make what could have been an interesting picture a drawn-out piece with only spots of decent material.It was not my point to turn this review into a treatise on 'why I like Saving Private Ryan better', but that is the easiest way I could show what I feel to be the major differences between the two. There are a few good parts in 'Thin Red Line' (like the anticipation of the initial attack) and a few interesting characters (especially those played by Jim Caviezel & Nick Nolte). Thus the two stars instead of one.Overall, though, I completely see why 'Thin Red Line' completely fell off the map (except in more 'arthouse' conversations) while 'Saving Private Ryan' went on to immortality. Why make a movie so frustratingly complex why the same emotions can be conveyed in a much simpler fashion?",2,5,8,2 March 2017
Green Book," A Little Bit Of Everything
","One of my favorite cinematic experiences is when a film comes absolutely out of nowhere and ends up being incredible. That is pretty much the story of 'Green Book', a movie that came into the 2018 holiday season with little hype but, when all is said and done, might be the frontrunner for 'best film of the year' on many personal lists. It sure is on mine, I can tell you that!For a basic plot summary, 'Green Book' tells the real-life 1962 story of Dr. Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali), a renowned piano player embarking on a tour of the Deep South. His race--African American--might pose some issues, so he hires cocky tough-guy Tony Lipp (Viggo Mortensen) from the Bronx to be his driver. As the two set out on their journey, it at first seems like an Odd Couple type of relationship. But as they experience more of each other's company--as well as the racial injustices of the territory--they come to both rely on and perhaps learn something from the other.This is a movie that really 'sneaks up on you', so to speak. It starts off relatively straightforward and one could be forgiven for thinking it's maybe even a little slow. But that character development pays off in an enormous way, as by the end you'll be holding back tears (or failing to) after witnessing the bond these men form out on the road and in face of adversity.For a movie like 'Green Book' to work, the acting has to be spot-on, and it surely is here. You'd never guess this was the same Mortensen that was once the sword-wielding Aragorn in the 'Lord of the Rings' franchise. He went all-in for this role, shaping both his voice and body to fit the part. Ali has slowly built up a fantastic career for himself, and there's nothing to stop that process here. The arc of his character provides most of the emotion of the film, and his scenes range from heartbreaking to hilarious.Speaking of 'hilarious', also consider that this film was directed by Peter Farrelly...yes, he of 'Dumb & Dumber' fame! While seemingly an odd choice to helm such an emotional project, it proves to be EXACTLY the right decision, as the humor in the film goes a long way towards establishing rapport between the two leads. As deep as the 'emotional stuff' goes (and it goes deep, to be sure), the comedy is easily just as well-done.I haven't even mentioned the soundtrack yet, which is another integral 'role' in the film. Whether it be Shirley himself or just the 'on the road' type tunes, the 'Green Book' soundtrack is one of the best I've experienced in quite some time. A great mix of jazz, piano, and orchestral sections.As you can see, I think that perhaps the biggest reason why 'Green Book' gets the full 10-star treatment from me is because it does a little bit of everything, and somewhat remarkably nails all those little areas to produce a masterpiece. The final compliment? The overall message of the film is a great one: that sometimes all it takes for two people to better understand each other (in this case it is black and white, but really it could be anything) is proximity. Had not fate drawn Dr. Shirley and Tony together, they would have spent the rest of their days likely stuck in their own little boxes. As it turned out, however, it took a road trip to cross those bridges and each man to learn a little from the other.Great story, acting, direction, humor, music, and emotion. What more can a movie-goer ask for?",10,17,33,10 December 2018
The Great Escape," One Of The Best 'Caper' Films Of All-Time!
","Film-making in the 1960s was a different exercise than it is today. It was more about 'putting on a good show' and appealing to a wide audience instead of focusing on certain key groups. Back then, families went to movies together as 'outings' and the movies were required to play as such. Sometimes, this leads to strange casting and watered-down plots. Other times, you get a movie like 'The Great Escape', which combines perfect characters, music, and an intriguing plot to produce a masterpiece of its time.For a basic plot summary, 'The Great Escape' is set at a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp where all the 'break-out artists' are holed up together. Eluding the eyes and ears of the guards, the inmates start to work on getting out. Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) is the ring-leader, while other key roles are played by Steve McQueen, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and James Donald. To say anything more about the plot would be to give away too many key details.This movie is such a classic because it does so many things right, including:-Some of the best acting performances ever assembled in a single picture. Not a single scene is wasted due to all the on-screen talent. -Despite the tense setting, a sense of humor shines through (mainly coming from McQueen's character). -A plot that will have you on the edge of your seat. You can instantly identify with the characters, so you find yourself rooting for them as the escape plan builds and builds. -Not being predictable. You will think you know how this movie is going to end, but it throws you enough curveballs to always keep you off-balance.For a nearly three hour movie, 'The Great Escape' never seems to lag or get boring whatsoever. It also features a score that contains a tune you will be whistling for days afterward. Basically, it is the type of movie where everything (cast, music, plot, direction) comes together for a perfect storm of film-making. If you are sometimes wary of WWII capers or older movies in general, do not let that stop you from watching this one. It is one of the best.",9,2,4,4 March 2017
Click," It 'Clicks', Alright
","When one thinks of an Adam Sandler film, the phrase 'juvenile humor' immediately comes to mind, filled with low-brow humor and outlandish acting. Fortunately, 'Click' is a departure (for the most part) from that categorization by providing an interesting story, developed characters, and very solid acting.For a basic plot summary, 'Click' sees Michael Newman (Sandler) struggling to find time for his family while wearing himself out for his never-impressed boss. On a routine trip to find a universal TV remote, Michael runs into a crazy scientist (played by Christopher Walken) who gives him a 'universal remote', alright...one that can control his entire life! Hilarity, emotions, & hijinks ensue.Besides the novel concept, this movie outshines other Sandler flicks due to its heart. While shaping up (in the early goings) to be a hijinks comedy, somewhere along the way a heavy dose of emotion is thrown into the proceedings. By the end of the film, the viewer will actually care about the main characters and want to see their resolutions.Granted, 'Click' does still contain some of the typical Sandler low-brow humor, but it isn't too over-the-top or suffocating. Far outweighing that aspect is the above-average acting from pretty much the entire cast, which produces a real connection between characters and audience.Overall, 'Click' is a fun little movie (though not for the younger kiddies) that may (at least in a small way) change your perception of Mr. Sandler. This isn't his goofy 'Waterboy' or farcical 'Billy Madison'. Instead, director Frank Coraci crafts an actual storyline filled with character development and fun concepts.",7,5,5,10 March 2017
Annihilation," Pure Science Fiction
","In today's moviegoing culture, I feel as if pure science fiction tales are heading the way of the dinosaur. Don't get me wrong...there are plenty of films that are set in sci-fi type environments, but most of those either lean heavily on the 'science' in sci-fi or end up being little more than character pieces. I believe there is room for a return to science fiction in its purest form, and that is exactly what 'Annihilation' provided me.For a basic plot summary, 'Annihilation' primarily focuses on Lena (Natalie Portman), an ex-Army veteran (now biologist) whose husband still serves. After being absent for close to a year, that husband (Oscar Isaac) suddenly walks through the door to their home. What Lena discovers is that he has been inside 'The Shimmer', a top-secret project to find out just what in the world has materialized seemingly out of nowhere and is spreading at an alarming rate. Lena herself enters the Shimmer with a team of women (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez, Tuva Novotny, & Tessa Thompson) in hopes of finding answers both biologically and otherwise.What I absolutely love about 'Annihilation' is that it is filled with great visuals and 'what-if?' moments, to me the essentials of strong science fiction. Does everything necessarily make sense or can easily be explained? Certainly not. But if it could, it would cease to be science-fiction. As viewers, I think we are so used to being over-explained or relying on hard science to bolster our enjoyment of these types of movies that we forget about that 'what if?' factor. These are the types of films that aroused my curiosity as a child, and apparently they still do to this day.Besides the great, intriguing visuals and interesting plot, the acting is also top-notch. It's especially great to see Portman back in a leading role, as she is such an incredible acting talent. 'Annihilation' could actually stand up as almost the blueprint for making a female-centric film in Hollywood these days (very much a hot-button issue in the industry). Never once is it pushed or preached, but 80% (or perhaps higher) of the film's scenes feature exclusively women. Never once did I think 'I wish this had more of a male presence' in the slightest. I think it just goes to show that if you conceive a good enough film and cast solid female actors, the results can kind of speak for themselves.For the second time now, director/writer Alex Garland has caught my attention with a science-fiction flick (the first being 'Ex Machine'). Like I've mentioned, these are the types of films I sought out as a younger man (full of wonder and possibilities) and am always 'up for' even today. Garland's work, then, will continued to be closely monitored by this film fan.Thus, I have nothing but praise for 'Annihilation' and hope that it does well in streaming & home video rentals (it kind of got pushed out of cinemas fairly quickly). While perhaps not quite as good as 'Ex Machine' or 'Arrival' (similar-fare flicks), this one is very, very close.",9,1,3,13 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Action, Adventure, But Lack Of 'Epic'
","In terms of action and adventure, 'Empire Strikes Back' is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that 'sense of something epic' inherent in its original predecessor.In 'Episode V', as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the Empire, this time on the ice planet Hot. The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). A new character in Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. The second half deals more with Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) beginning steps to becoming a Jedi. After the death (in Part IV) of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke goes to continue his training with Yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. The film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of Luke and Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), as well as a startling (if now clichéd) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter.Though a good movie in its own right, I always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. A recent watching confirmed this. I think the 'trouble' stems from the fact that 'Empire' is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas 'New Hope' was so incredibly genre-diverse, 'Empire' takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the 'asteroid'; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.Overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. For special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. For others, it may fall just a tick behind the original.",7,2,2,11 March 2017
Minions," This One's Just For The Kiddos
","Nowadays, when I see an animated movie like this, I pretty much expect it to entertain me as much as the target audience of children. The bar has been set that high. Unfortunately (at least for me), this one is pretty much just for the kiddies.For a basic plot summary, 'Minions' tells the story of, well, the Minions! While the little mischief- makers were well established in the Despicable 1/2 films, this one explains how they came to meet Gru. For thousands of years, they wandered the earth looking for the meanest bad guy to serve, from cavemen to dinosaurs to Yetis. In more recent times, they fall in with Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock), who is intent on stealing the Royal Crown (quite literally) from the Queen of England (Jennifer Saunders). As per usual, the Minions' frantic antics make this an almost impossible task, with one even being crowned King himself (King Bob!).Simply put, 'Minions' is a fun romp for any audience of children. The gags will elicit laughs, and just the concept of Minions in general is still enough to hold interest. Kevin, Bob, & Stuart (the main three Minions featured) will enthrall kids for the whole 90 minute runtime.Because of how high the animation bar has been set, though, I can't help but rate 'Minions' a pedestrian 3-stars by my own standards. Maybe that isn't fair to the film, but it is from my own personal perspective. This one doesn't have, say, the wry humor of a 'Toy Story', and emotional punch of other Pixar efforts, or even the sincere sweetness of its two predecessors. It's just silly, goofy fun.So, if you have kids, put this on and it will be a rollicking hour and a half of laughter. Just don't expect to become invested in the cartoonish fun like you probably have been in the past.",5,2,2,26 February 2017
Saboteur," A Product Of Its Times
","When reviewing a film like 'Saboteur', there are a lot of 'perhaps'-es that come to my mind. Perhaps the movie was better for its time? Perhaps it needs to be seen as a propaganda piece and nothing more? Perhaps it represents a different age of cinema? Even considering those factors, however, I cannot endorse this as an engaging Hitchcock flick because it just doesn't bring anything unique to the table of film-making.For a basic plot summary, 'Saboteur' focuses on Barry Cane (Robert Cummings), a man on the run from the law after being wrongfully accused of setting fire to an airplane factory. While pursuing the true baddie Tobin (Otto Kruger), Barry finds a tag-along love interest in Pat (Priscilla Lane).This movie has all the elements of a traditional Hitchcock movie: the MacGuffin plot device, the 'wrong man' scenario, the espionage plot, and the strong, independent female lead. Some of the camera-work is vintage Hitch, while the locales are distinctly 'American' in nature in keeping with the wartime nature of the film.Sadly, though, the overall plot is about as stale as they come. It is a scenario that is almost 'too easy' for the genre and provides no true suspense or meaningful character development. I suspect that a film like 'Saboteur' was made with a strong eye towards propaganda instead of overall quality.Thus, I can't recommend 'Saboteur' to anyone but die-hard Hitch fans or those who can sit through generic war/spy tales. You really just won't be getting anything new here.",3,1,5,10 March 2017
Spectre," Only For Those Who Know Their Bond History (And Even Average Then)
","In 2006, 'Casino Royale' changed the game in James Bond movies, as it was the perfect combination of great story, cool action, and even relevant character development (something a bit new to the Bond franchise). Unfortunately, that wonderful effort was followed by two clunkers, 'Quantum of Solace' & 'Skyfall'. 'Spectre' pretty much splits the difference between the Craig original and the other two sequels, producing a thoroughly mediocre film.For a basic plot summary, 'Spectre' sees Bond (Daniel Craig) on the outs with M (Ralph Fiennes), as the 00-program is being phased out of British intelligence. As usual, Bond gets sucked into a scandal involving a shadowy figure (played by Christoph Walz) that seems to be behind the dastardly events of all three previous films via an organization called SPECTRE. With the help of Q (Ben Whishaw) and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), Bond does some reconnaissance of his own, along the way meeting up with Dr. Swann (Lea Seydoux), who has a personal connection to SPECTRE as well.The main selling point of 'Spectre' is that, like 'Casino Royale', it works pretty well as a prequel...at least for those who have seen the previously Connery/Moore flicks. I have seen them all, so (without spoiling them) I can say that there are a number of iconic moments here. The film also hits all the usual Bond cues and does them pretty well.Unfortunately, 'Spectre' is also a film riddled with problems, such as...-Though SPECTRE and its history may be able to hold my attention, it likely will not do so for more modern fans who haven't 'done their homework'. I was watching the film with a sibling who has only seen the Brosnan/Craig Bonds, and he was pretty much disinterested from beginning to end. Thus, it works as a prequel...but only to an audience that is probably getting narrower as time goes by (seeing how those old Bond flicks don't really hold up all that well). -It should have been combined with 'Solace' and 'Skyfall' into one super-movie, where all those plots could have been examined in one whiz-bang type of film. Unfortunately, production decisions have only drawn out these recent Bonds instead of made them tighter. It's almost like after the disaster of 'Solace', they tried to go back to formula with 'Skyfall'. Of course, then fans said 'but aren't these supposed to be prequels?', so it was back to prequel-land for this one. -The whole concept of 'Bond girls', which the franchise now doesn't know what to do with. Nowdays, you can't get away with Bond saving the girl and then, well, you know. That doesn't fly anymore. I'm not saying its good or bad, but I just think the Bond franchise may need to re- evaluate how they use their heroines. Right now, they are trying to have it both ways...adding a beautiful female, but then not really knowing what to do with her. Besides her looks, Swann's character added little to 'Spectre', and thus her in a 'sidekick to Bond' role felt strange.All in all, then, I thought that this was a decidedly average Bond effort. As a fan who has seen all the previous installments, it was fun to see the history behind the crime organization most prevalent in them. As stated above, however, I wish that the franchise hadn't drawn out the character so far from his 'Casino Royale' days. Had they been able to use Bond's love for Vesper and rage at her death (from 'Solace'), his roots (from 'Skyfall'), and his discovery of SPECTRE in one single film, it would have been great. Instead, for probably a number of different reasons (chiefly, we 'can't give Bond too much character development', right, lest we completely drain the idea well?), that character development was spread over three average (or below) movies.Bottom line: If you are a fan of Bond's history in the older films, 'Spectre' will at least entertain you (although I can't promise much more). However, if you only know Bond from 'Goldeneye' on (and I think that comprises a large number of Bond-goers these days), this will be run-of-the-mill at best and confusing/uninspiring at worst. In this case, it's all about what previous knowledge you bring into the theater with you.",5,3,5,27 February 2017
Joy," Russell Crosses The Line From 'Quirky' To Just Plain 'Weird'
","There is no doubt that film director David O. Russell has a very unique cinematic vision. He actually started off (at least in his major films) with the pretty straight-laced 'The Fighter', but then 'Silver Lining's Playbook' was a bit kooky and 'American Hustle' even more madcap. While I liked all three of those films, I liked each of them a little bit less than their predecessor because I felt the great story of each picture was getting more and more covered up by the wild storytelling techniques. With 'Joy', that jump was even more pronounced, to the point where I struggled to even enjoy the experience at times.For a basic plot summary, 'Joy' tells the story of, well, Joy (Jennifer Lawrence), a woman who is unhappy with her life. Joy was always a dreamer and creator as a child, but both her mother (Virginia Madsen) and her father (Robert De Niro) are too caught up in their own life drama to give her much heed. As a young adult, Joy is practically the provider for and organizer of the entire family, but she decides she wants more. So, after a nasty glass-cutting-hands accident on a boating excursion, Joy sets her mind toward inventing and selling a self-wringing mop. During this journey she meets Neil Walker (Bradley Cooper), who introduces her to the concept of selling her productions on TV (QVC). Will Joy fail in the face of big business obstacles, or will she persevere? That is what the film builds towards down the home stretch.First and foremost, much credit has to be given to Lawrence for an incredible acting performance...one that I could see perhaps taking home some hardware. One film at a time, she is proving that she is oh so much more than a pretty face (even though she is very much that, too!) and rising above her teen-themed Hunger Games routes. Just the fact that she can go from playing Katniss Everdeen to Joy is a testament to her acting range. Joy's story is a compelling one, and Lawrence hits all the right emotions.The problem with this film, however, is that it often gets distracted from what seems to be the main purpose (telling Joy's story). There are little interludes feating soap operas that are quite bizarre, and the madcap tomfoolery that De Niro so expertly brought to 'Silver Linings Playbook' feels a bit tired. The story of Joy is worthy of the big screen treatment, for sure, but the movie just doesn't quite settle upon that until about half way through. Until then, it is filled with weirdness and madness in equal measure.So, despite the fact that the concept is sound and it gets some great acting performances, I felt that director Russell went a little too crazy in trying to be creative instead of just sticking to the story. As I mentioned in the opener, 'Joy' seems to continue a pattern from him in which each movie has to be a little more quirky than the next, which (at least to me) isn't what makes his movies successful to begin with. I liked Russell because he can show a great human story. This one just crossed the line into 'weird' for the first time.",4,1,2,28 February 2017
Her," The Nature of Humanity & Relationships
","The 'hook' that drew me to see 'Her' in theaters was simple: the interesting 'man falls in love with smart-phone' plot that was advertised in the trailers. While viewing the film, however, I discovered that this is a much deeper movie than I ever thought possible, dealing with the true nature of relationships and the very essence of humanity itself.For a basic plot summary, 'Her' (set in an unknown future year) focuses on the character of Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix). Theodore is an extreme introvert who, despite having the skill to create loving 'couples notes' as a profession, is completely lost in the real world of relationships. Amy (Amy Adams) is basically the only person in the world that he can be himself around, and even she is 'taken'. As such, Theodore purchases a new computer operating system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) that is basically 'Siri X 1,000'. An unintended result of the new operating system (in this case named Samantha) is that many users find themselves becoming romantically involved with the artificial intelligence. This is exactly what happens to Theodore Twombley.Like I said, what initially drew me into this movie was the more science fiction-esque 'man falls in love with smart-phone' concept. In this day-and-age of Hollywood sequels and repeated ideas, I found it refreshing that an entirely and completely original concept was at play here.What I did not foresee, though, was just how 'deep' this movie would go in describing the essence of relationships. 'Her' has to walk a very fine film-making line because its entire concept often times seems utterly ridiculous (how can a person ever fall in love with a computer?!). However, every single time the viewer may even have a moment where they think that, the movie proves that the emotions could indeed happen and be very real. Again and again in the theater, I kept thinking that certain events were going to transpire, only to be surprised (in a very pleasant fashion) at how different and unique situations actually played out.Basically, this is the type of movie that 'thinking people' (and I mean the REAL deep ponderers) will revel in. If you are looking for action or adventure, look elsewhere or be severely disappointed. Instead, 'Her' is about subtlety and frank discussions of romantic relationships and emotions. Yet, at the same time, it isn't so over-complicated that it turns into psychological mumbo-jumbo either.Overall, then, I can see why 'Her' was nominated for 'Best Picture' at the 2014 Academy Awards. It should, IMHO, win 'Best Original Screenplay' in a cinch. In fact, the only reason it can't be a serious contender for the bigger awards is because, at times, director Spike Jones gets really weird (some scenes are quite bizarre and maybe are even a little out of place in such a thoughtful treatise). Other than that, though, 'Her' is a gem for the 'thinkers' among us; those who loved to be challenge in the cinema while also being entertained.",8,1,2,4 March 2017
Slumdog Millionaire," Can't Quite Put My Finger On Why It Wasn't Great...
","I just recently finished watching the film sensation of 2008-2009, Slumdog Millionaire, and I wanted to share with you my initial reaction: It was a good film, with a few touching moments, but nothing that will really stick with me long after viewing.I'm not exactly sure why I'm not caught up in the hype surrounding this film (plus its selection for Best Picture at the '09 Academy Awards), but I just don't consider it to be in any way groundbreaking or special. I don't want to steal a thread that has been circulating around the reviews for this product, but it does seem to be a bit contrived in its storytelling method, where a poor contestant on the Indian version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' wows the entire nation with his knowledge of matters that should be beyond him. Over the course of the movie, though, viewers are shown exactly how he came to know the answers to those questions through a series of flashbacks.The film did a good enough job of building suspense that I could give it four stars over three, but I think its biggest downfall was that the central romance of the film was not a little more fleshed out. The romantic angle is supposed to provide the great drama at the end of the film, but instead (at least to me) it fell a bit flat in the notion that there wasn't enough romantic chemistry built up along the way.Thus, while I loved the 'Millionaire' segments and the ensuing drama that this film created, I felt that the background stories weren't quite compelling enough to turn this film into a classic. However, it is one of those unique movies that a person must see for themselves to make an accurate judgment on, so I would urge you to check it out. You may not LOVE it, but you will almost certainly LIKE it.",7,1,2,12 March 2017
Hacksaw Ridge," A Different (And Much-Needed) Kind Of War Movie
","War is usually synonymous with death and loss...especially at the movies. Stories abound about individuals 'doing what needs to be done', which usually involves quite violent, brutal acts in the name of country and duty. There is nothing wrong with those types of movies (as war truly is Hell), but Mel Gibson proves in 'Hacksaw Ridge' that the story of war can also include men of peace.For a basic plot summary, 'Hacksaw Ridge' tells the story of Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield), a young man who volunteers to serve in WWII. He faces once pretty severe obstacle, however...the fact that he will not pick up a weapon (a combination of being a 7th Day Adventist and some past childhood experiences). After a fight just to be allowed to serve, Doss finally joins up as a medic on Okinawa, participating in the brutal 'Hacksaw Ridge' campaign. Without a weapon of any kind, Doss continually runs into battle to save as many men as possible.There is just something about the story of Desmond Doss that will resonate with most audiences. He had a battle just to serve, then a more literal battle in Okinawa. You have to respect an individual who manages to serve his country but still remain true to his own personal beliefs. Doss walks a fine line, to be sure, but his courage and fortitude stand out in the end.It helps that Andrew Garfield is basically perfect casting for this type of film. Once Garfield stops screwing around with teen/Spidey roles, I could see him really establishing a serious acting presence. He combines boyish innocence with stern resolve (when needed).Another thing to note about 'Hacksaw Ridge' is that, much like Gibson's earlier 'Passion of the Christ', the violence of the real world isn't shied away from whatsoever. The war scenes here are brutal, but aren't overdone. In fact, I felt like the movie did a better job than perhaps any I've ever seen of portraying the sheer terror of the battlefield. I was legitimately unsettled on a number of occasions.Perhaps the highest praise I can give to 'Hacksaw Ridge', however, is that by the end I was trying to hold back tears...and not succeeding. Doss's story is such an emotional one, and is portrayed perfectly as such, that it excellently stirs emotions. It's a story that needed to be told, and director Gibson was more than up to the task.",9,4,7,24 February 2017
The Breakfast Club," A Little Cheesy, But Gets You Thinking
","To be completely honest, I usually hate movies like this. It's like Don McLean's song 'American Pie', where basically he just mashes up a whole bunch of different themes and lets people interpret them to death. It kind of takes the fun out of the experience. Fortunately, director John Hughes (Mr. 80s himself!) doesn't allow his weighty material to get in the way of the film's true message.Basically, the plot of this film centers on a group of five high-schoolers dragging into the school on a Saturday to serve their detention 'sentence'. They come from all walks of life: The Rebel (Judd Nelson), The Jock (Emilio Estevez), The Princess (Molly Ringwald), The Troubled (Ally Sheedy) and The Nerd (Anthony Michael Hall). While being lorded over by Principal Richard Vernon (played brilliantly by Paul Gleason; he almost steals the show!), the self-dubbed 'Breakfast Club' start to get to know each other a little bit.From there, the rest of the film is essentially two things: a series of hilarious sight/action gags to foil Mr. Vernon, and (more importantly) a treatise on the cliquish life of high school students. Led by the colorful commentary of Nelson's hard-edged character, each stereotype is carefully picked apart and laid bare for the world to see. Is 'Ringwald' truly a good girl, or just fooling herself? Is 'Hall' a dedicated student, or just playing the role to keep the few friendships he has? Plus, the instigator ('Nelson') turns out to be perhaps the most interesting character-study of them all!What keeps the movie from seeming too high-handy and sappy, though, is the wonderful directing of Hughes. Unlike, say, James Cameron's 'Avatar', where the issues are preached to you in black-and-white terms with no room for disagreement, Hughes leaves it up to the viewer to decide who 'The Breakfast Club' members really are. You can view them as Mr. Vernon does, or have the opportunity to delve in deeper if you so choose.Thus, I have no problems recommending this film to any and all fans of movies that will really make you think. The ending may be too cheesy (but probably needed to satisfy the teen audience), but along the way it packs quite an intellectual and emotional punch, with a hefty dose of comedy thrown in as well.",10,1,1,11 March 2017
Gladiator," 'Death Smiles At Us All. All We Can Do Is Smile Back'
","For all you really avid movie-watchers out there, think about this question for a minute: Have you ever seen a movie starring Russell Crowe where you said 'that was really bad?'. I didn't think so either.For a basic plot summary, 'Gladiator' tells the story of Maximus (Crowe), one-time member of the Roman army turned gladiator slave at the hands of tyrant ruler Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). While fighting all that the Colosseum can throw at him, Maximus must also inspire a revolution to return Rome to its former glory.Despite starting off quite slow for the first 30-40 minutes, 'Gladiator' quickly becomes top- notch drama primarily because of the simmering intensity Crowe brings to his role. Without his presence in this film, I cannot think of another actor who could have turned in such a nuanced, show-carrying performance. His gravitas on screen carries itself almost without dialogue whatsoever.This is also the kind of film (much like Crowe's later work 'Robin Hood') that is quite long but only builds on itself. It takes some time for the real drama to really kick in, but when it does it is all the more pertinent because of the character development we have already seen.Overall, 'Gladiator' is a great movie that has a little something for everyone. If you like historical fiction, battle scenes, drama, or incredible acting, than this film will capture your interest for a full two and half hours. I can easily see why it cleaned up at the Academy Awards in 2001.",9,2,3,5 March 2017
Donnie Darko," Films This Deep Need SOME Explanation, But This One Provides Nothing
","I am an avid film-watcher, especially ones with mind-bending material such as this one, but I can honestly say that I've never had a stranger experience watching a movie than 'Donnie Darko'.For a basic plot summary, a teen named Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) who may or may not be just a tad emotionally unstable begins seeing a vision at night of a giant bunny. When said bunny saves him from certain peril one night, it sets in motion a chain of events that present Donnie with a serious of decisions he must make. To say any more would be to starting leaking spoilers.I'll start with the positives here: Despite the fact that the film gives away absolutely nothing (like a never-ending card game where the hands are never shown), it was still an enjoyable experience. The characters are interesting, the plot is intriguing, and even though I never quite knew exactly what was going on, I never felt like I was wasting time. It always seemed as if forward progress was still being attained.That being said, I can't give this movie the full five-star treatment like so many others. Why? Because I believe any movie has to have some sort of 'base' (or some answers given), and this film just refuses to provide them. It's like being asked to decipher a code without being given any sort of 'key'. Maybe I'm missing something big here, but until I finished the movie and went online in search of answers I was utterly clueless as to what the heck I just witnessed. Those online 'answers' that I found, however, didn't seem to have shown up in the actual movie itself (or very slightly). SPOILER ALERT: It all seems to be related to the 'book', but yet the book only shows up in flashes in the movie. Only in promotional materials does the book seem to be explained, giving us the 'key' to understanding at least a little bit.Of course, it is always possible that I just 'don't get it'. But until I do, this is an oddly middling effort for me. More frustrating than anything, as I was totally engaged until the end when I was severely let down by the esoteric nature of the experience.",5,6,10,5 March 2017
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Still Entertaining, But This Time Lacking In Punch
","I have to give director Michael Bay a great deal of credit in this Transformers series. He manages to make three movies that are basically all just carbon copies of each other and make them all at the very least entertaining. That is no small feat. Thus, although the luster of the franchise begins to wear off (especially towards the film's conclusion) in this installment, 'Dark of the Moon' still is an entertaining romp that won't leave you bored.For a basic plot summary, 'Dark of the Moon' formulates the notion that the Apollo 11 moon landing was merely a 'smokescreen' for the retrieval of alien (i.e. Transformer) technology. Many years later, this technology predictably falls into the wrong hands and leaves the fate of the world to Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his military buddies (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, & John Turturro).The positives of this movie are the usual: the special effects are a spectacle to behold, the action/adventure is pulse-pounding, and it is just a visual treat to watch. More importantly, though, is that the franchise still goes as LaBeouf goes. Though his exuberance for the Sam Witwicky role seems to have diminished just a bit (and perhaps that can be attributed to the character's aging as well), but his scenes are still the best of the experience.Sadly, this movie also has a few notable 'misses' that render it only slightly above average. First of is the utter exclusion of Megan Fox's character. I realize that Fox had a falling-out with Bay and wanted nothing to do with this movie, but the fact remains is that her stand-in (supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) has nowhere near that great romantic chemistry with LaBeouf. Rose is just as 'bombshell' as Fox, but acting-wise it isn't even close.Also, in this third go-'round, the general plot begins to get the slightest bit old. It is never boring, per se, but it doesn't have that 'edge' like the first two did when the characters were still fresh.Overall, 'Dark of the Moon' is a decent effort that doesn't end up boring in any way. The exclusion (and no explanation) of Fox is the biggest missing piece here, but other than that it is pretty much 'same old story' (with just slightly less enthusiasm all around).",6,4,4,8 March 2017
The Social Network," A Film Worthy Of Facebook
","An idea like Facebook is one that changed the world. It needed a film up to the par of that idea, and that's exactly what David Fincher provides here.For a basic plot summary, 'The Social Network' tells the story of Facebook's creation and subsequent legal battles. It is told primarily (via flashbacks) through the recollections of creator Mark Zuckerberg (Jessie Eisenberg) as he wades through the various lawsuits.There are three areas in which this movie really shines:1. Direction: There is no dull moment in this film. Fincher really keeps things hopping and upbeat, as befitting a movie about the greatest social invention perhaps of all time. Very deserving of his Oscar nomination, and I'd vote for him for the win.2. Acting: Only in the best of movies can outside-the-box casting choices make you not feel as if they are out of place. For example, Brenda Song (known worldwide as the ditzy London Tipton of Disney Channel fame) plays essentially a 'Facebook groupie', while Justin Timberlake has a small-ish role as Sean Parker, founder of Napster, who has a major influence on Zuckerberg in the Facebook development process. Remarkably, those thespians show no effects of typecasting and fit in seamlessly.3. Ideas: Besides just a summary of Facebook's creation, the true genius behind this movie is the ideas/notions it stirs up. The definition of copyright, the creative process, and the definition of friendship are all themes that are swished around during the movie. No grand conclusions or black-and-white summations are given. Instead, it is left up to the viewer to decide on the ethics of what just transpired.Thus, I consider 'The Social Network' to be one of the better movies I've seen in the past few years. Facebook literally (for better or worse) changed the world, so there are very few people who won't be affected in some way by the film. I'm clicking the 'Like' button on this one.",10,1,1,11 March 2017
The Pursuit of Happyness," A Movie For Its Times (And Perhaps Beyond)
","Back in 2006 when this film was released, the United States economy was headed towards the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930's. 'The Pursuit of Happiness' is a reflection of those hard times.For a basic plot summary, this movie (based on a true story) focuses on Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a salesman who can't seem to make ends meet. His products are not selling and his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) wants to leave him. Caught in the middle is young son Christopher (Jaden Smith). In a sort of last gasp effort to make a better life for his family, Chris decides to accept an internship as an investment banker under the tutelage of Jay Twistle (Brian Howe). It is truly a make-or-break effort that will require even more sacrifice in the short term. as the internship is unpaid (but may lead to stable employment).The themes central to this film are ones that most viewers can relate to: working hard, making sacrifices for family, and contemplating the hard choices in life. This is why the movie packs such an emotional punch. We all see (or would like to see) a little bit of ourselves in Chris Gardner, and that makes us root for him to succeed in life all the more. His seemingly endless setbacks only deepen that emotional connection.It helps that the acting in 'Pursuit of Happiness' is top-notch, with the crown jewel being the chemistry between Will Smith and real-life son Jaden. Theirs are the emotional backbones of the story, to be sure. In recent years, Will Smith has seen his career hit a significant snag, but rest assured that this is him at the top of his acting game.'Pursuit of Happiness' is also able to connect with viewers on a personal, day-to-day level. Perhaps in a future United States where the economy improves, these themes won't be so readily apparent. But even now (and especially in 2006) those hard choices that Chris must make I'm sure mirrored many individuals in America. Tapping into current culture can be a powerful thing on the big screen, and this film realizes that potential to the max.Overall, I very much enjoyed this viewing experience. It isn't quite good enough to go into my 'All Time Favorites' category, but it easily does enough things write to be an emotional, meaningful film.",7,1,1,1 March 2017
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The Perfect Indy Formula
","'Raiders of the Lost Ark' established the Indiana Jones franchise as the standard for action/adventure on the big screen. 'Temple of Doom' proved that the films could also have a sense of humor. 'The Last Crusade' melds both of those elements together, creating the perfect formula for an Indiana Jones film and making it the best of the lot in the process.For a basic plot summary, 'Last Crusade' sees Indy (Harrison Ford) initially dealing with the capture of his father, Dr. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), by the Nazis. Indy quickly discovers that the ultimate prize is the literal Holy Grail of biblical lore, which Papa Jones had an almost single- minded devotion towards finding.The most easily-identifiable reason for the rousing success of 'Last Crusade' is the chemistry between Ford & Connery, which steals every scene they are in together (a considerable portion of the film). Indy was never supposed to be a superhero-type figure (just an archaeologist with a penchant for adventure), so having a father (one who even saddles him with childish nicknames, no less!) really serves to humanize the character even further. Also, each Indy film needs someone to play against Indy's straight-arrow personality towards discovery, and Connery is absolutely perfect in that role. The banter between the two is pure cinema gold!I think the film is also helped by a move towards more 'traditional archaeology pursuits', so to speak, after the Indian mysticism of 'Temple of Doom'. Not that 'Temple' was a bad film by any means, but I think the Indy formula works a bit better if the 'pot of gold at the end of the rainbow' is a bit more identifiable. The quest for the Holy Grail fits this mantra perfectly, and sets up perhaps the best sequence of the entire Indy series (progressing through the three traps set to protect the Grail).Another remarkable aspect of 'Last Crusade'? The initial 'Indy as a kid' (played by River Phoenix) section, meant to promote a spin-off that never reach much critical acclaim, should have probably been nothing more than a money-grab. However, probably thanks to Spielberg's directing, even that material is thrilling and adds depth to the Indy character.Overall, 'Last Crusade' is my favorite of all the Indiana Jones films for the way it combines all the best aspects of adventuring filmmaking. As far as I am concerned, this is the true creative ending to the Indy saga. There is a great quote from Spielberg noting 'There's a reason we had Indy riding off into the sunset for the final scene'. After the embarrassment of 'Crystal Skull' many years later, perhaps a future 'Indy 5' will get things back on track creatively. Until that time, though, Indy will always be first and foremost a trilogy to me, with 'Last Crusade' shining brightest at the top of the pyramid.",10,1,1,26 February 2017
Back to the Future," The Film That Defies The Word 'Genre'
","When you head to your local video rental store, or browse the selection online with a site like Netflix, the titles are usually arranged according to genre, such as drama, action, comedy, romance, etc. However, when it comes to Back To The Future, truly one of the classic films of our generation, a copy would need to be put in almost every category, as it is the only film I have seen to date that defies the very notion of genre.The basic story revolves around young 1980s kid Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) whose friendship with mad scientist 'Doc' Brown (Christopher Lloyd) ends up with Marty in a time machine (made out of a Delorean, as if any more humor was needed!) whisked away to the year 1955, where he skewers the timeline and must make sure that his parents meet (and procreate sometime down the line, if you will) and fall in love once again.Yet, that 'simple' plot contains so, so much more in terms of just overall entertainment. It is hilarious ('Why don't you make like a tree...and get out of here'), romantic (the George-Lorraine plot thread), dramatic (will Marty make it back home?), and full of enough action and adventure to rival a Stallone or Schwarzenegger flick!The acting is also some of the best that cinema has to offer. While Fox and Lloyd play the primary leads, the acting trio of Lea Thompson (playing Lorraine Baines), Crispin Glover (George McFly), and Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) almost steal the entire show on certain occasions with their various personalities. Even the 'bit players' are superb in their short, yet very important/meaningful appearances.Perhaps the most impressive thing about this entire film experience, though, is the detail put into each and every scene. One must pay close attention to every single detail (no matter how seemingly small) of every single scene in the 1980s-portion of the film in order to better understand the jokes and sight gags of the 1950s-era time frame. I have probably watched this entire film all the way through at least a dozen times, yet on each viewing I find something new that I seemed to have missed.Thus, on my list of 'greatest movies of all-time', this effort is without a doubt in the top five for its ability to suck a viewer in on all levels. Watch with confidence knowing there will never be a dull moment!",10,1,1,12 March 2017
The Birds," Hitchcock Goes Paranormal
","Usually, master film director Alfred Hitchcock used the psychological approach to filmmaking, crafting thrillers that preyed on deep-seated fears or tension-filled situations. With 'The Birds', however, Hitch actually delves into the paranormal a trifle in order to work his cinematic magic.For a basic plot summary, 'The Birds' sees young socialite Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), on a vacation in Bodega Bay, become suddenly smitten by local boy Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor). However, as the two begin to mingle, the small island town is suddenly beset by bird attacks both large and small, seemingly without reason.As usual, this film is such a classic because of Hitchcock's ability to create tension. By the title alone, the viewer knows that birds will play a large role in this film, so in the early-goings Hitch uses certain scenes/images to foreshadow what is to come. Basically, as a viewer, you know what is going to happen...you just don't know when or from where!The acting in this movie also really stands out. Hedren and Taylor are solid, while supporters such as Jessica Tandy and a young Veronica Cartwright turn in fine performances as well.About the only criticism I have (aka why I can't give it 5 stars) is of the ending, which many will find quite polarizing. Let's just say that, depending on your point of view, a lot of character development may have circled the drain upon the film's conclusion.Overall, though, this is a solid film that deserves a place among Hitchcock's best.",8,1,3,11 March 2017
Sully," Well-Made Movie, But A Complete Lack Of Conflict Keeps It From Greatness
","There is no doubt that 'Sully' is a well-made film. I don't think Clint Eastwood (director) could do anything less at this point in his career. The tone is proper, the acting is fine, and the story is an inspiring one. It's just missing that one thing any film needs in order to have any dramatic purpose: conflict.'Sully' tells the story of Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), the pilot of a passenger jet who, along with co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), experiences dual-engine failure shortly after takeoff. With seemingly no other resort, Sully guides the plan down into the icy Hudson River, and all 155 passengers and crew are rescued safely.Here's the problem with 'Sully', flat-out: It doesn't have any conflict. Eastwood is a master at telling two sides of a story, but in this case only one side exists. No matter how evil Eastwood makes the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) look for questioning Sully, or the couple scenes where Sully beings to doubt himself, the audience is never given plausible evidence to believe that Sully is anything but a hero. It makes for a good feel-good story, sure, but not necessarily up on the big screen where some drama needs to be present.All that being said, there is nothing technically wrong with the film. The airplane scenes are thrilling, the acting is solid all the way through, and Eastwood's tone (set by the real-life visuals and simple music) is right. If you perhaps know nothing about Sully's story, you might be completely drawn in.To me, this is the type of film that might actually work better 5-10 years down the road, being watched by audiences that don't have any knowledge of the events. Since they won't know the details like current audiences do, future watchers might be able to get more invested.As it stands, however, 'Sully' is a film that is very well-made but just doesn't have the greatest dramatic story to tell. One would think it would be, but instead it just lacks that central conflict that any great movie needs. As such, I can't really give it the highest of marks (even if it is little fault of the film's own). At this point in his career, Eastwood can do any project he wants...and he's earned that. But some will be better/more interesting than others, and I felt 'Sully' feel somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.",5,1,2,27 February 2017
Jurassic Park," Playing God
","Far too many times, movies that tackle very complicated, edgy topics end up taking too much of a 'black and white' approach and not showing the shades of grey that exist in all areas of life. Fortunately, director Steven Spielberg doesn't let this happen, and instead lets the plot play out to its fullest.For a basic plot summary, 'Jurassic Park' sees billionaire mogul John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) build an amusement park housing eight species of dinosaurs. However, in order to get the corporate 'O.K' on the whole project, Hammond calls in two scientists Alan Grant (Sam Neil) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) to put the place through a fine-tooth comb from a biological perspective. However, largely due to some corporate intrigue, the park is completely shut down during the tour, leaving all the electric fences unwired and setting up a struggle between species that were never meant to interact.First and foremost, this is an action/adventure flick filled with impressive images, and in that role it succeeds admirably. The 1993 graphics still measure up to anything that has been produced today, and almost all of the action sequences are breathtaking and will have you on the edge of your seat.What really gives 'Jurassic Park' a solid four stars, though, is that Spielberg doesn't 'take sides'. Equally screen time is given to both perspectives: educational and biological. The viewer is allowed to see the pros and cons of both, and weigh them themselves in advance of the sequel.Overall, this is a solid film that delivers in all important departments: effects, action, plot, and characters. Plus, thanks to the Spielberg direction, it holds up very well almost 20 years later.",8,1,1,11 March 2017
The Wizard of Oz," A 'Wonderful Wiz', Indeed
","After reading the novel 'Wicked' (which I was thoroughly bored/disappointed with) and then picking up the book 'The Making of Oz' (which I enjoyed immensely), the natural progression led me to sit down and watch the original 'Wizard of Oz' film for the first time in 10 years or so. As people have likely been saying for 70 years now, I was transformed into a small child once again, inwardly dreading the exact second the Wicked Witch first comes on the screen in a big puff of smoke and singing along to each and every song/dance number.Everyone knows the story...Dorothy Gale from Kansas 'travels' to the magical city of Oz, where she meets such characters as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion, while trying all the while just to get home. During her travels, she is tormented by the Wicked Witch of the East, as well as entering into a love/hate relationship with the Wizard himself.What really strikes me, though, is how well this film has held up over time. With the possible exceptions of Casablanca and Gone With the Wind (and I believe an even stronger case for 'Oz' can be made than either of those two), this film has charmed the hearts and minds of both children and adults alike for an incredibly long time. Just think of all the children's movies (e.g. Disney, Pixar, High School Musical) and television programs (e.g. Cartoons, Nickelodeon, Disney Channel) that have came and went over the years, yet children (like the younger sister I recently watched the film with) still watch with wonder as Dorothy opens that door into the wonderful world of Oz.Thus, there really isn't anything bad that can be said about The Wizard of Oz. It is the consummate children's film, filled with incredible color, silly acting, and plenty of singing and dancing, while it still holds its appeal to all but the most crotchety of older folks, as the filmmaking was so well-constructed that it stands the test of time.It is a long-held tradition that the film is shown once a year on network television, and I would recommend adhering to that 'regime', even if you go the DVD route. Trust me, it will never get old.",10,6,7,12 March 2017
Dodgeball," How Many Jokes About 'Balls' Can Be Made In 90 Minutes?
","Basically, my thoughts about this movie can be summed up in the title of this review. A family member of mine got this movie as a gift last Christmas, and just recently I was in a 'comedy' mood and gave it a viewing. By the end of the film, though, the only person I was laughing at was myself for sitting through the whole thing.The problems with this film are numerous: The jokes rely way too much on crude humor, they often aren't even funny in that area, and the goal of the film (to combine comedy with an even somewhat compelling storyline) is not even close to realized. About the only positive impact this movie had on society was to get people playing the game of dodgeball once again. Yet, it was no thanks to the jokes in this movie...just the base subject matter.Thus, if you are looking for 90 minutes of laughter, please look elsewhere. Only a couple of decently funny scenarios kept this movie away from a bottom-of-the-barrel one star rating, and a '1.5 stars' would have been the optimal rating. Fans of Ben Stiller will find Zoolander to offer more genuine laughs, while others may want to steer clear of this entire comedy genre altogether.",3,1,3,12 March 2017
The Martian," 'Apollo 13' Meets 'Interstellar'But Not Quite As Good As Either
","'The Martian' is a solid movie. It has an interesting plot, some good character development, and (in a complete departure from most Ridley Scott films) contains a very hopeful, at times even light-hearted tone. Most people viewing this will find it a very enjoyable experience all-around.Here is the problem, though: About a year ago, 'Interstellar' was made by Christopher Nolan. It shares many similar character types and themes with 'The Martian'but manages to beat it in nearly every single area. So, I have to say that it was a little weird seeing this movie and thinking that not only it wasn't as good as 'Interstellar', but now it is chronologically second-fiddle too.For a basic plot summary, 'The Martian' primarily tells the story of a member of the Aries III crew exploring Mars sometime in Earth's future. A violent windstorm picks up and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is flung off into the eye of the storm and presumed dead, his fellow crewmates having to make a tough decision and a quick getaway. Due to some incredible luck, however, Watney is most certainly not deadjust stranded on Mars with few supplies and not enough food to last until any sort of retrieval mission can be furnished. The catch? Watney is a scientist (a botanist, to be exact), and must tap into all of his ingenuity and wits in order to survive until NASA can pick him up again.Like I said, 'The Martian' is a pretty good movie when looked at with tunnel-vision. It has all the right ingredients for a great sci-fi drama, and those ingredients do indeed gel together to form an entertaining final product. It has some high-concept themes, impressive visuals, and that sense of gravitas befitting films like 'Apollo 13'. Damon turns in a great performance, and his scenes are the highlight of the entire experience (had the movie focused on him even more exclusively, I probably would have liked it even better!).There are indeed two major problems that keep this film from being a classic sci-fi adventure, though:1. The casting besides Damon is very poor. Jeff Daniels is terrible as the head of NASA, as is Kristen Wiig in a similar corporate role, and Jessica Chastain's character is inexplicably under- utilized. As such, the scenes where Damon isn't front-and-center really drag the fun to a halt.2. Maybe this isn't 100% fair, but it still stands that this movie can't really hold a candle to Nolan's masterful 'Interstellar', and that turned into kind of a problem during the viewing experience. I mean, think of it this way: A film featuring Chastain, Damon, space travel, space anomalies, and all set in a very hopeful tone. Where have you seen that movie before? I know that 'The Martian' is based on a book and thus it is difficult to scream 'plagiarism' too loud, but having not read the book I really don't know how closely it was followed. To me, then, this sure seemed like an opportunity to capitalize on the success by using the same general themes of the previous 'Interstellar'.Bottom line: Had I seen this movie a year or so ago, I may have liked it considerably more. However, once one has seen movies like 'Interstellar' before it, it kind of feels old-hat. Not a bad movie by any means (and hence the four-star rating), but also not all that close to being one that will be remembered for years, either.",7,1,2,26 February 2017
The Fighter," Why Are Boxing Movies Never Really About Boxing?!
","For whatever reason, considering the low real-world current popularity of the sport, boxing fares quite well at the cinema (think Rocky, The Champ, & Million Dollar Baby to name a few). That tradition continues with 'The Fighter', a film that delves into so many more themes than just the sweet science.For a basic plot summary, 'The Fighter' tells the dual stories of brothers Mickey Ward (Mark Wahlberg) and Dickie Ecklund (Christian Bale). Coming from a family of almost total dysfunction and seemingly headed for a life of manual labor, the boxing brothers each face their own inner demons as Mickey takes his 'last shot' at pugilistic success.What really makes this a spectacular movie is the incredible complexity of the characters. Nothing is black-and-white about the entire experience, with all the plots/characters providing ample opportunities for shades of grey (the sign of most truly great movies). Nothing is predictable whatsoever, with the character dynamics changing regularly as the situations dictate. From beginning to end, the intense emotional roller-coaster will keep you on the edge of your seat.Of course, what makes those emotions really 'pop' are the incredible acting performances. Bale nearly steals the entire show as the enigmatic Dickie, cementing himself as perhaps the greatest pure actor of the present day. Wahlberg also nails the emotionally-drained Ward as he tries to navigate the pathetic petty family drama. Finally, Amy Adams (playing Charlene, Mickey's girlfriend) shows her acting chops as the fulcrum point from which Mickey goes from 'hanger- on' to 'legitimate contender'.The directing is adept as well, considering that no scene or character is wasted. Every single frame and interaction is meaningful in the overall scheme of things.Thus, I consider 'The Fighter' to be one of the greatest sports films of all-time. Everything (from acting to plot to direction) is solid and no time is wasted in the hour and fifty minute runtime. I could have watched two MORE hours and not have been bored in the slightest.",10,5,7,10 March 2017
Up in the Air," A Complex, But Satisfying Journey Through One Aspect Of The Human Psyche
","Ask most people what they would do with an unexpected sum of money, and this answer will likely pop up quite a bit: travel the world. Well, Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) gets to do exactly that...for his job.Bingham, while 'up in the air' 322 days out of the year, makes a living by firing people at the request of major corporations who would rather not do the dirty deed themselves. He seems to live a blissfully happy life, unburdened by the responsibilities of home & family, and enjoys his routine immensely. Until, that is, he meets someone just like him...Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Throw in spunky new sidekick Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), who sets out to change the way he does business, and Bingham is forced to re-evaluate all of life's priorities.What really makes this film work is, much like Gran Torino, the unbiased nature of the storytelling (making it the exact opposite of a film like Avatar). Viewers are treated to two completely different sorts of life (both on the road and settling down at home) with all the pros and cons included, and must (through Bingham) come to their own conclusion about which life is more satisfactory.The acting is also terrific, with Clooney doing what he's done for years and finding a good thespian match in Farmiga. However, it truly is young Kendrick who nearly steals the show with her energetic performance. Her character superbly represents the thoughts and feelings going through the heads/hearts of the viewers, questioning Bingham on nearly ever decision he makes. I don't say this too often about young people in the film business, but the sky is the limit for this woman based on this incredible performance.Finally, a little anecdote about why this movie may touch you as it did me:When I was five years old, my father played a little trick on me. He said he had a 'magic pill' (a common vitamin, of course!) that would make me stay 'five forever', allowing me to go to school and play with my toys ad infinitum. I took the bait hook, line, and sinker, but only after swallowing the pill were the consequences brought to my attention, such as seeing all my little friends grow up, always having to take naps, etc. After a bit of contemplation, I then chose the 'antidote' to set things right again.Filmmaker Jason Reitman operates under the same concept with 'Up in the Air'. We are first given a glance into the seemingly wonderful life of the man on the road, but only upon deeper introspection do we discover the true nature of his often lonely existence. What makes things interesting, of course, is the fact that his decision is much more meaningful than from some five year old.Thus, I strongly recommend this to film fans of any and all kinds for its deep story and incredible acting. If, say, Avatar turned you off by its overly black-and-white themes, this is the antithesis.",9,1,2,11 March 2017
