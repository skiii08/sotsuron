10 Cloverfield Lane," 1+1=<1
","I had reasnnonably positive expectations about this flick and, of course, I was disappointed. The story's been told several times over and most of the action is utterly predictable - except for the one big question at the beginning, granted, for which we get a first answer, then a twist and yet another twist. The problem with this film is that it tries to be two things at the same time, in just 94 minutes. * SPOILERS!! * There's what happens inside, and what happens outside. So there's first a kind of a thriller, and then a kind of an action/SciFi film. The two parts just don't add up. The movie would have been much better if it had chosen to be either the first, or the second kind. Here, it's just insufficiently convincing in both attempts. Oh and we have about 15 minutes of action taking place completely in the dark in the second part so you actually have no clue about what's causing the shouting and screaming. In one word : disappointing.",5,0,1,8 June 2016
The Butterfly Effect," Mindf@ck film just like they should be
","I seldom come out and write movie reviews in IMDb but I felt this one deserved some effort from me. I don't recall any movie which made me shiver thinking about what was gonna come next when I hit pause to go for a pee or any other reason. This one is really something. There is a 'Lost Highway' feel to it and the themes are closely related but...The Butterfly effect is in fact more complex.It is a really disturbing movie, not so much for what it shows, but for what it keeps you guessing - like all true thriller masterpieces - , about events that take or might take place, and above all, about human sanity and the subtle twist there is between the average Joe's walk of life and outright perversion. Requires multiple - rewarding - viewings.",8,14,14,27 July 2012
