The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Sucks bigtime!
",The most terrible movie ever. Bad acting. Bad looking actors. Bad story. Bad dialogue. Bad direction. BAD SEX SCENE! I literally fell asleep half way thru the movie...the one redeeming factor was that Big Cinemas has pretty good samosas. Oh...and the back of her wedding dress was pretty neat.And I need to write at least 10 lines to abide by IMDb's guidelines...so here's more. Watch for the scene where the werewolves 'talk' to each other. Truly cringe-worthy....makes you embarrassed on behalf of the actors. Did they really think that a scene like this would look good on screen?And oh....the scene where Jacob takes off his shirt and runs? HILARIOUS. I guess the director thought that would be a good idea :) NOT. A. GOOD. IDEA. MADE. PEOPLE. LAUGH.,1,15,20,4 December 2011
Skyfall," Not a typical Bond movie...but a great movie nonetheless!
","I went for the movie with some very high expectations - engendered partly by the fact that Quantum of Solace had left me miserable - and am happy to report that Skyfall more than fulfilled my expectations.Die-hard James Bond fans might be disappointed, since this movie represents a drastic departure from the genre - Bond here is more sensitive, more given to self-deprecating humor, less prone to emphasizing his manliness, and most importantly, has a past. A past that he shares with M, and that catches up with both of them.The movie starts with a spectacularly magnificent action sequence across the rooftops of a Turkish bazaar (India's loss, Turkey's gain), and culminates in Bond seemingly being shot and plummeting to his death. Of course, since he is Bond, he is not dead, and returns when the ghost of an ex-agent comes back to haunt MI6 and M.The ex-agent Silva is played to great effect by Javier Bardem, uglified,for lack of a better word, with bleach-blond hair. Silva has a few bones to pick with M who he believes has betrayed him, and he has a diabolical plan to bring her and MI6 down.While the movie differs from its predecessors also in not being an all-out action flick, mention must be made of the inventive fight sequence in a Shanghai high-rise - shot in darkness, lit by flashes of garish neon - the fight is seen mostly in silhouette, and is very realistically choreographed.Both Bond and Silva get our sympathy - the first by his portrayal of an aging man, haunted by his past, desperately trying to prove himself in a young man's world, and the second by the trauma he has undergone for the sake of a cause he wrongly believed in. M played by Judi Dench, is the true Bond girl, forget all those bimbos you have seen over the years. She is funny, she is feisty, she is manipulative, and she will do anything to gain her own ends. Her defence at the enquiry is a masterclass in acting.The movie ultimately belongs, as it should, to Daniel Craig, probably the finest actor to ever play Bond. He truly embodies everything that James Bond should be - a man in every sense of the word. Perhaps nothing embodies the evolution of Bond as well as Craig does - he has moved from a wise-cracking lothario to a man who is keenly aware of his failings, physical as well as psychological, and triumphs in spite of them.",10,9,21,16 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Man is the new superman
","There's a not-so-disturbing trend in superhero mythology now...one where the superhero is unmasked and stripped of his superpowers, forced to confront his nemesis, is nearly defeated, but triumphs over evil in the end. We saw this happen in 'The Dark Knight Rises' and now in 'Iron Man 3'. Perhaps the next Thor movie will see Thor battle evil minus the hammer...But this is about Iron Man - the third one in the series, and what an awesome third one it is. Tony Stark the man is more in evidence here, either unarmed, or armed in bits and pieces of his prehensile iron man suit. The villain is the suitably menacing Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) who turns out to be a front for someone far more sinister. Did I say 'unarmed'? That's far from the truth since Tony Stark comes armed with an endless supply of quips, ingenuity, brains, mechanical skills...and when all else fails, he gets by 'with a little help from his friends'. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark as though he was born to it - the physicality as well as the intellectual force is very evident. So is the brash humor...now the Stark hallmark.All the other players in the movie - Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall - are competent and inhabit their roles completely. Ben Kingsley is incredibly good in a role that takes a sudden unexpected turn. But at the end of the day, they are all mere supporting characters for Robert Downey Jr., and the movie never lets us forget it.The action sequences are incredible and keep you enthralled...the 3D effects have you actually cowering in your seat. The attack on the Stark mansion, and the final showdown are the best I have seen in a very long time - fantastic without being over the top, and perfect for 3D.Watch it - you won't be disappointed.",9,2,10,26 April 2013
Gravity," The most visually stunning movie ever!
","Gravity is unlike any movie ever told.The plot is simple - two astronauts are adrift in space and have to a find a way to rescue themselves and get back to earth. Nothing more, nothing less. What grabs the viewer is the treatment of this simple storyline and the incredible way in which the movie depicts it.The movie begins with these words against a black screen ''At 600 km above planet Earth, the temperature fluctuates between +258 and -148 degrees Fahrenheit. There is nothing to carry sound. No air pressure. No oxygen. Life in space is impossible.' No music, no dialogue, as the screen disappears, replaced by our planet. It fills the screen and engulfs the viewer within it, so much so that you feel like you are floating, spinning along with it. And you see this spot, in the distance, to the right. The spot moves closer to you, drifting on its orbit until finally it arrives, filling the screen, blocking your view of earth, and you see the American space shuttle and a team of astronauts floating outside it. And then you are inside the movie, part of it, experiencing the same space as the astronauts, a feeling of utter weightlessness and peace.Within the first thirty minutes, everything changes. Peace and serenity becomes utter horror. A routine repair mission becomes a disaster, with one astronaut dead, and two others drifting into space. The rest of the movie revolves around their efforts to get back to earth.As I said, a very simple plot, and in the hands of a lesser director, or lesser actors, the movie would have been a disaster as well. As it is, Alfonso Cuaron's vision is ably supported by his lead actors Sandra Bullock (playing emotionally damaged yet strong enough to single-handedly carry the day) and George Clooney (effectively playing himself - suave and breezy as always). There are no other actors, except Ed Harris as the voice from Houston, and a couple of other voices.The problem is that rather than dwelling on the actors' performance, exceedingly good as they are, my mind keeps going back to the special effects, the result of more than a year in post-production. There is one incredible shot that I remember - when the character of Bullock is cast adrift into space. There is dead silence punctuated only the sounds of her harsh gasps. The camera moves towards her, closer and closer, until her terrified face fills the screen, and then incredibly, suddenly, the camera is inside her helmet, and we are looking at the vast expanse of space through her eyes, and realize how awfully alone she is. And that's just one scene of the movie. Right from the utter desolation of space to the cramped confines of a rescue ship, the director's vision has imagined it all, and he has brought us into the ambit of his imagination.Gravity is not a movie you just watch, it is a movie that you experience, it is a movie in which you get involved. Remember, in space, no one can hear you scream.",Null,1,3,15 October 2013
The Hangover Part II," Unmemorable and unfunny
","I loved the first Hangover. It was just so fresh and funny and irreverent...and so unexpected! The second one attempts to ride on the success of its predecessor...and it just does not work. Comparisons are odious, I know, but the filmmakers have INVITED comparison by making the second movie an exact copy of the first one, albeit set in an 'exotic' location.What was funny in the first movie just seems plodding and labored in the second one. Case in point - Alan (played by Zach Galif...whatever). The first time around, he was sweet and clueless. Now, he's just unpleasant, yet just as clueless. The other characters don't even merit a mention - they are just so lacking in personality, it's hard to believe that we laughed at their antics last time around.And yes, there is a monkey...I do hope he/ she/ it got paid handsomely. Nothing is going to compensate for the fact that the monkey has to perform an unmentionable act on a certain body part at the beginning of the movie.The first part (yes, the comparisons are inevitable) at least had an element of suspense...as in 'what the hell happened?'. Now you just don't give a hang.",2,16,28,29 May 2011
Logan," A fitting finale to Logan; simply the best X-Men movie ever
","Logan must be the one of the best superhero movies I have seen, probably next only to The Dark Knight Rises. The last movie about the Logan character, this is a superb end-story, worthy of the character.Logan, as played by Hugh Jackman, is now aging, with a body that has taken too much punishment and seen too many better days. Trying to escape his demons, he has now taken refuge in the bottle and seems to be punishing himself for his supposed misdeeds. He is no longer invincible, has a permanent limp and a hacking cough, and takes much longer to heal. His adamantine claws are intact though, and make periodic appearances in some of the most brutal and violent action sequences ever seen in the X-Men series. But more about that later. In a reversal of fortune, Logan has now taken on the guardianship of Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart), whose brain is deteriorating, causing him to lose control of his telepathic abilities, leading to catastrophe. A brain that was once classified as weapon of war, is now at the mercy of medication. Logan makes regular trips to the border to administer the medication - the professor is kept inside a huge empty metal tank, in the care of an albino mutant tracker named Caliban. The metal tank is needed to blunt the professor's mental outreach. In the course of one of these trips, Logan ends up taking on the responsibility of a young mutant with powers suspiciously similar to his own. This mutant is being tracked by the bad guys, and all hell breaks loose when they finally encounter her. The action sequences in the movies are raw and realistic, highly violent and gory (decapitations and severed limbs are in abundance); the car-jacking scene, with its sudden burst of violence is especially riveting, as is the first incredibly brutal encounter between the young mutant and her pursuers. The scenes are shot so seamlessly that it's difficult to tell where the stunt ends, and CGI begins. Also, there's none of the extreme-close-up-jerky-hand-held- camera-shots, rather there's a return to classic, straight-shooting action, perfectly integrated with the rest of movie. None of the violence is just for the heck of it, rather it is essential to move the story forward. Jackman perfectly encapsulates the slowing abilities and physical deterioration of his character, but what he does best is portray his character's emotional state - Logan is angry and desperate, wanting forgiveness and redemption, while also wanting to forget. He is giving way to mortality despite being for all purposes, immortal, and in a way, welcomes his impending mortality. Stewart's portrayal of the old and ailing Professor Xavier is brilliant and touching - a prodigious brain, rapidly degenerating, locked in a failing body, controlled by medication, needing help for even the most mundane of activities - Stewart plays this to perfection - he may not have McAvoy's baby blues, but in talent he is unsurpassed. This superb end-story for Logan has a solid emotional core that doesn't feel forced or manipulative, unusual for a superhero movie, and is probably the finest comic-book adaption you are going to see for while.",10,2,6,4 March 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Live. Die. Repeat. Perfect!
","What I found so enjoyable about Edge of Tomorrow is that very little time is wasted on explaining the concepts on which the movie is based. This allows it to be a smart, taut and riveting action movie, pared down to its bare essentials. The basic premise of the movie is this - what if you were given multiple chances to 're-set' your life. Would you learn from your experiences and improve the direction of your life, or would you just live it over and over? Make no mistake, the movie doesn't spend time pondering this question; it just jumps right into the middle of answering it, and does so with a minimum of fuss and backstory.Tom Cruise plays William Cage, an ad executive who's working as the media relations officer in the war between invading aliens and us earthlings. Cruise is in superb physical form in the movie, endowed with unfairly high levels of energy and charisma. He is unwillingly thrust into the battlefield (for reasons I couldn't quite grasp) and is killed off by an Alpha alien within the first 20 minutes of the movie. Due to some of the alien blood having entered his bloodstream, Cage is now able to repeat his life...starting from the point where he is kicked awake by his soon to be commanding officer. It is to the movie's credit that this does not become repetitive, especially as we see Cage resetting and repeating more than 10-12 times, each time getting closer to understanding how to get rid of the aliens. In the course of the resetting, he meets Rita Vartakis, played by an unbelievably muscled Emily Blunt. Rita is the army's poster girl, killer of hundreds of aliens. Having gone through the same arduous resetting process as Cage, she becomes his ally in the fight against the invaders.The training sequences and the resetting scenes are tightly edited and are probably the best parts of the movie. There isn't much chemistry between the lead actors, although this may have been intentional. Shoehorning a romance into this movie would have killed the flow.Oddly enough, once the resetting scenes are done, and the actual task of finding and killing the aliens is taken up, the movie starts to flag. It's almost like the movie changes directors, since the tough parts are over! It moves from smart thriller with an innovative concept, to a generic action movie. But that's just the last few minutes.Overall, the movie is great to watch, with fine performances from Cruise and Blunt. Bill Paxton also makes an appearance as a scenery-chewing commanding officer. The battle scenes and the final showdown are executed so well, you just might stop believing in the existence of CGI! And oh, for a change, it's not an American landmark that gets decimated in the movie :)",8,2,4,9 June 2014
X-Men: First Class," Super-watchable....but eminently forgettable!
","I saw this movie about a week ago, with some suppressed expectations! I had heard so much about the movie, and so many good things, I was almost afraid to see it and be disappointed :) Well...I wasn't disappointed - I thoroughly enjoyed the movie; James McAvoy looked cuter than a bowl of ice-cream; and Michael Fassbender's long lean lithe body was perfect for his very action-oriented role.The problem is that I now cant remember what it was all about. And that shouldn't happen if the movie was really good to start with. Good equals memorable (I can still remember most if the dialogue from Gladiator). Therein lies the rub dear reader - X-MEN:First Class is a great bit of fluff. A great way to spend 2 hours in a theater; great special effects; great-looking people. It is NOT a great movie in any sense of the term. Watch it - enjoy it - DO NOT term it a classic!!",5,0,2,25 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," An epic trilogy....a magnificent conclusion...a movie that was worth the wait.
","The Dark Knight finally Rises! I have been waiting for nearly a year for this movie, and it was well worth the wait. Being a huge fan of both Christopher Nolan as well as the previous two Batman installments, I was actually wondering if this movie would be able to do justice to my expectations....YES IT DID!The movie is unusual in the sense there isn't much of Batman in the movie. Bruce Wayne the man is there (ably played by Christian Bale), carrying the burden of false accusations, injuries and advancing age. He walks with a limp, carries a cane, and has no cartilage left in his knees and shoulders. The man who saved Gotham is now seen as its biggest villain. He is forced to come out of self-imposed retirement when a new terror hits his beloved city...Bane. Bane is played by Tom Hardy, with a raw physicality rarely seen on the big screen. Its not just his incredibly transformed body that conveys the menace that is Bane, but his voice with its swooping tones and accent. I was a bit skeptical about how his covered face would translate on screen, but Tom Hardy has taken this character and made it his own. His gestures, his eyes, even his forehead - he becomes Bane. His talent is too obvious to be hidden under a mask. The movie is grand in scale, with numerous characters - old as well as new. Alfred (Michael Caine) gets a role that's worthy of his talents, with a more emotional core. Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) writes the book on great acting - how does one convey a character while lying immobile in a hospital bed. Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) is as competent as ever, with the deadpan humor and witty one-liners. Adding to the mix are some new characters - Selina Kyle aka Catwoman (Anne Hathaway) is surprisingly good in a role made famous by Michelle Pfeiffer...and infamous by Halle Berry. The surprise package is John Blake played by the yummilicious Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The cute kid from 'Third Rock from the Sun' has grown up...and how! He looks good, he acts amazingly well, and he could well be part of the next Batman movie (hint, hint!).The movie has numerous plots and sub-plots - in the hands of a lesser director, all of this could easily get confusing, or worse, make the audience lose interest. But not in this movie - director Nolan has a firm grip on the reins, and never lets go of any of the plot points. Every line has a point to it...every incident leads to a resolution...every character is needed to take the story forward. There isn't a single unnecessary character or scene in the 2.45 hour long movie. And the human element is never lost sight of, while at the same time executing sweeping and intricate plots.There were times when I felt that Nolan hasn't just made a movie about a superhero....he has actually made a powerful commentary on our times. His plot has echoes of the global financial crisis, as well as the various 'occupy' movements going on in various parts of the world. His movie seems to be a metaphor for a world in disarray and chaos, with Gotham as its disintegrating heart. Or you could just forget about the political metaphors, and watch it for its grand spectacle, the great acting, and the incredible SFX!!",10,3,7,21 July 2012
Looper," One of the more original movies this year!
","Having seen a lot of sci-fi movies (big fan of the genre), I went to this movie expecting a decent action thriller at the very least. I was pleasantly surprised - what i got was a movie with an original and very intelligent script, good performances, some great action, and a thought-provoking ending.Looper is set some years in the future when time travel and telekinesis are common, with the former being outlawed, and the latter being viewed as more of a party trick. The mob (yes the future has a Mob!) use time travel as a very ingenious way of getting rid of people. They send the victim back to a pre-specified time, blind-folded with silver bars strapped to his back. When the victim appears, there's a 'looper' waiting to kill him off and take the silver as payment. At some point in time, the looper is made to kill off his 'older self' thus closing the loop. Sounds complicated? The whole concept of time travel is complicated - yet the movie manages to explain everything very clearly with no loose ends and not a single plot hole.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a looper Joe, going through his life stashing away a bit of his silver bar payment, doing drugs, and in general, just waiting for when he has to close his loop. When it does happen however, he hesitates, and his older self (played by an older, grayer Bruce Willis) makes an escape. Joe has already seen what happens when a loop is not closed - a friend of his is killed off horribly for the same mistake.The rest of the movie focuses on both the Joes fighting to stay alive and also trying to find the younger self of the Rainmaker, a feared crime lord of the future who ordered the assassination of older Joe. The logic is that if the Rainmaker's younger self is eliminated, he is removed in the future as well. Of course, killing a child is always difficult, and this dilemma is what provides the movie with its emotional core.The child playing the younger self of the Rainmaker is a talent to watch out for, switching between cuteness and menace in a heartbeat. Jeff Daniels plays the crime lord sent back from the future to ensure discipline among the loopers, while Emily Blunt excels as the single mom trying to raise a telekinetic child on the right path.The movie of course belongs to Gordon-Levitt and Willis, both fine accomplished actors who deliver all that is expected and more. Credit is also due to the script - simple, elegant, yet intelligent to make the audience focus.",10,3,8,13 October 2012
Life," Do not watch if you liked the Alien movies
","If you did not like the Alien movies, then this is the movie you so richly deserve. The movie starts very promisingly, and quickly devolves into melodrama and mayhem. A key character takes an 'executive decision', and pretty much leaves the audience bereft. This also has the effect of leaving the rest of the space team unhinged, which explains the terrible decisions they take throughout the rest of the movie. Honestly, a bunch of Boy Scouts would have handled the crisis better - said crisis consisting of an alien life-form, nicknamed Calvin, that turns out to be far less cute than the name suggests. Calvin is a bad boy who wants nothing more than to...I'm not sure, since Calvin's motivations are not spelled out here, other than to perhaps create chaos. When the strongest emotional point in a movie is the death of a white rat, you know the movie has unsolvable issues. Calvin suffers from a bad case of CGI-itis, glaringly obvious in many scenes. The movie cast suffers from a lousy script, bad writing, and a clear aversion to actual acting. The movie in general has a strong disinclination to be nothing more than a poor rip-off of Alien and Gravity.",2,7,15,29 March 2017
Spectre," Skyfall's poor cousin
","Well, this is an abject lesson for me. I went for this movie thinking it was a sequel to Skyfall (only the finest James Bond movie ever made), and as it turned out, it was a sequel to probably every JB movie ever made.Spectre begins promisingly enough. As always, the opening sequence is awe-inspiring; an almost wordless collage of action. The theme song that follows is a precursor of how quickly your expectations are going to be squashed – a squeaky, scratchy wailing that does not deserve to be in the same universe as Adele's Skyfall theme. The opening action sequence culminates in the killing of Mario Sciarra, an assassin. We find out a couple of scenes later that the former M (Judi Dench) had asked Bond to kill Sciarra in the event of her death. As usual, this is something that Bond (Daniel Craig) does outside of the limits of his job, as a result of which he is suspended from duty by the current M (Ralph Fiennes). Sounds familiar? In spite of this suspension, he steals a car that was reserved for 009, and goes off to rescue Sciarra's widow, again on instructions from M. The widow, played by the luminous Monica Bellucci, has nothing to do, other than get seduced by Bond and provide him with info regarding the organization to which her husband belonged - Spectre. Bond goes for a Spectre meeting and there, he meets Franz Oberhauser (Christophe Waltz, playing the same character he has played in his last ten movies). We later find out that Oberhauser is not who he says he is, and in his own words, is 'the author of all your pain'. The exposition scene where we find out what drives Oberhauser is probably one of the weakest scenes in JB history. For whatever reason, in the big exposition scene, Waltz's character is wearing short trousers that ride up above his calves, along with tan socks. I can't imagine anyone looking less menacing. The big reveal behind what drives Oberhauser is something that could have been cured during his childhood with a bit more parental attention, and possibly a couple of skilfully administered spankings. Disappointment. And yet, Spectre is fun to watch on a very basic level, probably because of Daniel Craig, who brings his usual raw physicality to this very demanding role. Gone is the aging and vulnerable Bond of Skyfall, who was more human, and had actual *gasp* feelings! The Bond of Spectre is a steely automaton who purses his lips, gazes off into the distance, and can kill while blindfolded, with his hands tied – he actually does this at one point. He is able to recover at super-human speed – watch him do his thing right after being horribly tortured. He also seems to have an inexhaustible supply of impeccably tailored bespoke suits that fit him well in all the right places. If there ever was an award for Most Glorious Man-Candy, Bond would win it, hands down. The action sequences are topnotch, especially the car chases and the brutal fight on the train. If I haven't mentioned the second heroine Madeline Swann (Lea Seydoux), it's because she's a complete cipher, with zero personality and acting talent. Waltz coasts through the movie, using the exact same mannerisms and expressions he has been using since Inglorious Basterds. And oh, there's Andrew Scott (from Sherlock) playing a spymaster gone bad; it's evident he hasn't gotten over his Moriarty hangover. Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw (playing Q) are, as always, completely impactful in their roles.",7,5,10,1 December 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Buckle up those seat belts!
","Intense, visceral, perverse, brutal, exhilarating – Mad Max: Fury Road is all of these and much more!A simple storyline without any frills or back-story, the movie grabs you right from the start and doesn't let go. Set in a dystopian future, where wars are being fought over water, the movie follows Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) as she attempts to escape from the clutches of the despotic Immortan Joe (Hugh Keys-Byrnes), taking his harem along with her. Of course, Immortan finds out, and proceeds to unleash an all-out pursuit of Furiosa and his harem of Five Wives. So where does Mad Max come in, you may ask? Well, the fact is that the titular Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) actually plays second fiddle in this movie; it must have taken Hardy a certain amount of courage to play an iconic role that ends up being secondary to that of the female protagonist. The movie has a strong, yet non-strident feminist tone that does not detract from the rest of the action, and seems like a very natural extension of it. The movie opens with a high-octane chase when Immortan Joe's War Boys take Max captive in the Citadel. On finding out that he is a universal blood donor, they hook him up as a blood bag to Nux (Nicholas Hoult) a War Boy afflicted by tumors and therefore running on 'half-life'. Max, still hooked up, is taken along in pursuit of Furiosa, during which he is able to escape. Antagonists at first, Furiosa and Max become allies in their quest for the Green Place, her homeland. Every high-intensity chase sequence is immediately followed by a higher-intensity one. Every time you think that it can't get any better, it does. Every time you feel that you can now start breathing, something else comes along to knock the breath out of your lungs! The best part is that there is no shaky-cam or in-your- face-cam, which is what passes for action nowadays. The action sequences actually seem credible and effectively tread the fine line between glorious spectacle and complete insanity. There's actually a pretty good reason for this – it seems that the use of CGI was kept to a minimum, and stuntmen were used as far as possible. The movie is not just high-octane action and incredible pursuit vehicles; the themes of freedom, sacrifice and redemption form a strong emotional core for the movie. Stellar performances from Theron, Hardy and Hoult elevate this to much more than a mindless action flick. Hardy's monosyllabic Max is tortured by a past he cannot forget, while Theron is splendid as Furiosa, willing to kill (and die) for a childhood utopia she can barely remember. Hoult is unexpectedly able as Nux, in a role that calls for equal amounts of viciousness and tenderness. No matter how high your expectations are, believe me, this movie will meet them all, and then some!'What a day, what a lovely day'.",10,4,14,17 May 2015
The Martian," Castaway + Gravity = immensely watchable movie
","If Castaway and Gravity were to have a child, and that child had a great sense of humor and optimism, that would be The Martian. Matt Damon is perfectly cast as the titular character, so called because he is the first to grow plants on Mars, and therefore colonize it. He plays Mark Watney, an astronaut who is left for dead by his colleagues on Mars, after a freak accident leaves him unconscious during a aborted Mars mission. Well, he is NOT dead, soon recovers and patches himself up, and then dedicates himself to the task of sustaining himself until the next rescue mission. Mark's character is that of an intelligent optimist, with a generous sense of humor and level-headedness. All of these qualities go a long way in making sure that he does not lose hope during the time that he is on Mars, and that he takes ownership for his sustenance and eventual rescue. There is a sense of intimacy created between the audience and Mark, since a big part of the movie consists of him talking directly to the camera (ostensibly recording vlogs). We get to see his emotions, his occasional sense of defeat as well as his sense of humor, his loneliness, his tears and his happiness, and above all, his never- say-die attitude. At times during the movie, I could hear sniffling in the audience, there was the occasional cheering and clapping - you don't generally get these reactions unless the audience is emotionally invested in the movie.The movie belongs to Matt Damon; this doesn't take away from the fine performances of the other cast members. Jessica Chastain is in fantastic form (as always) as the commander battling with the aftermath of a decision. Sean Bean, Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor have extremely well-written roles that are deserving of such fine actors.",9,1,4,23 October 2015
