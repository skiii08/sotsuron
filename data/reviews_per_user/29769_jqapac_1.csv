Marie Antoinette," Marie Antoinette-Artful and Intimate
","Sofia Coppola has directed a masterpiece concentrating on the quiet intimacies of the last royals before the French Revolution. Shot beautifully with an endless parade of amazing costumes, there were very few negatives I would attach to the film. Kirsten Dunst is tantalizing and it is difficult to take your eyes away from her every movement. Jason Schwartzman is quiet, intelligently boring and perfectly cast for King Louis XVI. Sofia adds an contemporary edge to the film through music and language but this doesn't upset the delicate nature of preserving the characters integrity. Hats off to Sofia Coppola. I loved this film. If you love art, fashion, or are interested in the elaborate and intimate nature of the eighteenth century French Royals, you will love this film.",7,3,6,10 November 2006
