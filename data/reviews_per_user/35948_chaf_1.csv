The Blair Witch Project," Oh God, please don't let them make a 'Blair With project 2'
","Scary? No way. Good acting? No way. Was there anything good? YES: that it was only 80 minutes long.I must admit one third of the time I closed my eyes, not because I was so scared but I didn't want to puke in a full theater due to Heather's shaky camera action. Speaking about Heather: already after 15 minutes I began to feel the urge to shove the camera through Heathers' throat so she would finally shut up, what an annoying girl. She surely gets my vote for worst 'actress' of the year.If you like movies where half of the script exists out of actors saying 'F**k' and 'Jesus' and get scared by a pile of rocks, this might be a film for you. Otherwise you better save your money.",2,0,1,11 October 1999
