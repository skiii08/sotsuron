Requiem for a Dream," Best Film of 2000 It's Turned the Volume Down IT HIT ME HARD
","This film is unlike anything I have ever seen. HAUNTING VISCERAL HARSH AND SAD....SO SAD . It's an emotional assault... a visual masterpiece, it's actors shined so bright especially Ellen Burstyn. Her oscar should be sent now. I'm 16 and I found it so moving that I believe it should be shown to all High School students it has the power to change life .LOVED THIS FILM and hated it so much for the last 30 mins of this movie it was better than words can express.",10,0,0,10 January 2001
