Requiem for a Dream," bad casting, nervous camera
","This movie was interesting because of the story from Hubert Selby. And for the first hour it was thrilling to view. But then, some mistakes get clearer. It was wrong to cast Jennifer Connelly for this movie. She will always be an upper class girl, also when she is on H. It was annoying to saw her trying to look like a junkie. I think she was casted because she was an uprising star in hollywood. And every director wanted her to play in their movies. Or it was the guilt of her agent. Jared Leto fits much better for his role. He was so nervous right from the beginning, that it felt right to see his demolition. The camera also get boring after a hour. They repeated some scenes to often. The message was already made clear, but they repeated again and again the scene how to cook up heroin. And then, the cuts, were sometimes to fast. I know that this was chic at this time. But not everything which is chic fits to a story. And not every actor has to be casted because he or she will be a star. 5/10",5,1,2,11 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I gave it a 9, only.
","The book is one of those I had read most. I read it approximately 6 times. The movie was great, but it was too great for me. It was the only way to do it, but I was only sometimes surprised. Everything was so large. It just failed to raise my interest. And you saw what was real and what was not. Perhaps it was too early to  do it. But on the other hand then someone else had done it. And perhaps much worse.",6,0,0,2 January 2002
The Green Mile," Good movie, but the ending is not felicitous
","Hi, although I don't believe in such thing as wonders I enjoyed the movie very much, except for the ending. The casting was very good, every actor was well chosen, especially greetings to Harry Dean Stanton, welcome back to mainstream ;-). The movie was a little simple-hearted but very thrilling. I felt it so unfair that a wife from the prison-system was rescued by a man who was sentenced to death. And the escape from the jail was a leak in consistency because all the other guards would had give notice when a prisoner would leave the jail. And I can not understand why the director choose to show such a long ending. In my opinion it would be better to let the movie end with the killing of John Coffee. The tension was gone and I felt that I wanted to leave the cinema (in real I saw it on TV). So I choose to give it only 7 from 10.",7,0,1,3 October 2002

The Sixth Sense," See it twice! And then forget it!
","The problem with such a movie is that the gag from the end of the film is very good but that's all. You cannot make a religion out of this movie, or do you? So if don't believe in a life after death (like me) you see the movie twice and then you want to forget it, because the story is too unbelievable. And the story has holes. And when you see it for the second time you recognize that the director has take a deeper look to Hitchcock and Kubrick. But OK, it works! So the director has learned his lessons well.",6,0,0,29 September 2000
