Iron Man 3," over rated.....
",I have tried to watch the entire movie several time. every time I have attempted I fell asleep. It takes to long for any action to happen. There is nothing different or extremely interesting about this flick even though it made a killing at the box office.This is the type of movie that the producers have an in with the critics. If this movie was made independently or by the unknown it would have gotten bad review and received the helping hand a movie like this gets at the box office as well as DVD and Bluray sales and rentals. I guess this is the way the movie industry works with movies that make your TV look and sound really good.,4,0,3,21 August 2013
