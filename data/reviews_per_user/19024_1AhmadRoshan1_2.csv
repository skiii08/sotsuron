The Incredible Hulk," Idk
",Idk what I'm feeling about it. Cause the last time I saw this movie was around the time it came out and I didn't remember much. But when I rewatched it I didn't really like it. Why does the girl just forgets about her boyfriend and just tries to sleep with Bruce? What?,4,0,2,25 May 2019
Knives Out," Entertaining movie
","Like all crime movies, this contains plot twists, some major, some minor. I can say that most of the spoilers were, quite honestly, surprising to me, and I did like the movie overall and Craig's and Chris Evans' performance were good. However, I did predict one of the main plot twists from the beginning which made the movie from that point on to be not as enjoyable as it was before. Although because I didn't reach the right conclusions from the plot twist that I knew, the hole in the donut if you will, was coming, it was still enjoyable as a whole (pun intended.). So I do recommend watching it. If you're looking for a mystery movie that is amazing watch murder on the orient express. The Suchet version was more enjoyable for me but you could also read the novel.",8,3,5,3 March 2020
