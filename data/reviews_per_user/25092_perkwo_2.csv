Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," One of the best film with lower ratings (IMDB)??
","This is one of the best film i have watched in my lifetime (and i have watched a lot). I don't like writing reviews of any kind but in this case i am making an exception. This film has lower ratings in IMDb (7.3) while other sites like rotten tomatoes, meta critic gave a high rating (>90%)for the same. I uses IMDb for checking the quality of a film or a series before watching it,as i believe the higher the rating more the quality. But in this case its the other way around that is a good quality film with lower rating (i consider film with less than 8/10 as below average). The lower rating in IMDb may be due to some offensive (but comical) subjects in the film which many have considered rude or insulting. From seeing the film we can determine that cast and crew faced a lot of hardship for making this film. If you want good quality film with a realistic touch i would personally recommend you to watch this film.",10,0,1,5 September 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Unquestionably Best Sci-Fi of 2014
","After a long time i have seen a proper science fiction movie which intrigued me. The ending of the film was somewhat abrupt but movie as a whole is worth watching. Now a days the films released as science fiction are chick flick or teenage oriented movie (eg: Giver, Enders game) which is stereotypical, doesn't have any rationale of true sci-fi and lacks skilled cast. End of tomorrow is a movie with strong story and a skilled actors which will lock you into the chair from starting to the end. The film tells about the story of a solider who live,die and repeat (kind of a looped life) and his attempts to get back to his real time line. The veteran actor Tom Cruise has done a commendable job in this film so as other actors. The director also has done a fabulous job of making a complex plot into a realistic story which can be grasped by common folk.",10,0,3,4 December 2014
