Iron Man 3," Disappointing
","If you're going to see Iron Man 3, expect it to be very much unlike its two predecessors in terms of acting, story and development. It seems as though the writers forgot how to make an Iron Man movie and left us with a product that is far from what it could have been. RDJ, Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Kingsley and all the other actors put a lot of effort into making the plot believable, yet there is only so much a stellar cast can do with the messy, overly simplified and predictable script that they were given. Even RDJ's antics seems forced and unfunny at times. Story-wise, there's not much to it and it's safe to say they could have at least tried to make the villains somewhat menacing instead of hilarious and shallow.The action sequences will compensate, right? Wrong. Even here, the movie manages to not make any sense. In Avengers 2 or Iron Man 4 (should there be one), it'd be great if the writers could agree on exactly how (in)destructible the suits are so as to not create rather sizable differences in 1 movie.All in all, if this weren't an Iron Man movie it would be a sub-par action movie that nobody would really care about. As it stands, it's a sub-par Iron Man movie and people will see it. If you do, either lower your expectations or prepare to be disappointed.",5,18,42,24 April 2013
Man of Steel," As epic as Superman should be
","After having seen this movie twice, once in 2D and once in 3D, I can simply say that this movie is excellent in its presentation of Superman and the world he lives in. The sheer epicness of this movie is in perfect alignment with the power that Superman possesses. Wide shots, big scenes and an explosive use of what CGI can offer render a movie that is suitable only for this specific hero and I commend Zack Snyder for having achieved exactly what this superhero needed. Never could I have imagined how Superman's capabilities would be put into context, yet here it is.I'm not saying that this movie is without fault though. As big as it is, it is the details that are not so super every once and again. Story- wise, there are some aspects that may seem illogical to the uninitiated and yes, some of the lines are corny. Where I could easily forgive these mistakes I can imagine that others are having a bit of a tougher time doing so.The structure of the movie allows for the main story and Clark Kent/Superman's origin to be told at the same time. I thought this worked very well: alternating between scenes detailing his past and scenes showing the here-and-now happenings makes sure we get to see why he makes the choices that he makes. That he does some things in his past (e.g. the truck-destroying scene) that are not Superman-like is easily explained by seeing how he finds out what man he decides to become later on in his life. I mean come on, not even Superman can be exempt from exacting petty revenge like that.This isn't a perfect movie, yet as far as superheroes go it manages to get it right as far as I'm concerned. If you like superhero movies, this will be a fresh take on what they can look like.",9,3,8,7 July 2013
Batman Begins," Batman begins properly
","Ever since the Batman series took a wrong turn somewhere in the 90's, I was a little sceptic when I heard there was going to be a new one. This quickly turned to curiosity upon hearing Nolan was to direct it.And once again, he hit the right spot with this movie. Instead of introducing a colourful batman and his adversaries, he gave us the blessing of not even seeing batman in the first hour of the movie! The entire film is built up fantastically around how Batman came to be, why he did and how. The movie isn't even about how he fights the bad guy:it's about how he himself develops. Thus, we get lots of fine dialoguecombined with a healthy amount of action as Batman tries to save Gotham.This movie is an excellent reboot of the series, and sets a standard for superheroe movies in the future.",9,1,1,2 August 2008
The Dark Knight," Stunning
","Tonight I went to see the movie for the 2nd time. I do this with every movie I highly enjoy seeing the 1st time: this way I can see whether it was just a whim of excitement that got me, or the movie really was that good. This second time around, I had a good view of the acting, but most of all the story itself and the way it's directed.Enough has been said about Heath Ledger in other comments, and my opinion is these comments are right. The other characters in the movie are overshadowed by him, but certainly do perform excellently. Eckhart sublimely works up to his performance of Two-Face and does that well too, while Bale shows us a Batman who's more and more becoming aware that maybe he's not the hero Gotham needs. The rest of the characters were cast very well; I always enjoy Caine, and Gyllenhaal replaces Holmes in a very good fashion.The story itself is so fast-paced I felt like the movie had just been running for 15 minutes when the half-time break arrived. The run-time of 2.5 hours is certainly not too much for what the screen gives you. This is of course promoted by the way it's directed: the scenes are woven into each other in such a way that you'll never get bored. I can't see how the scenes could fit any better than this.The excellent story combined with amazing pacing and directing, and the presence of this wonderful array of actors all a perfect match for their roles results in what I think is the best movie I've seen so far in my life. As a final note to this movie, I'd be surprised if this one doesn't receive at least some nominations for the academy awards. Seeing it win a couple would be fair the way I see it.",10,6,13,1 August 2008
