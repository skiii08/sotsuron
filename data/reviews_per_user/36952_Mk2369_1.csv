The Avengers," Nothings perfect...but this came close.
","Joss Whedon's, 'The Avengers' was the most talked about movie since the trailer first aired. I was excited to see it and yet I ended up missing it in theaters and sadly had to wait for it to come out on DVD. When I finally was able to rent it and put it in, I knew right from the start what everyone was talking about. This movie has everything that anyone could ever want out of an hero action packed, semi comical and slightly sad movie and yet, to me, there still seemed to be some mysteries that were left to question. Like any other films that are made to lead up to another it is usually important that one sees the films beforehand so that way they know each characters original story. I felt that with 'The Avengers', for the people that did see all of the movies: 'Thor' with Chris Hemsworth, 'Iron Man' with Robert Downey Jr., 'Captain America' with Chris Evans and even 'The Hulk', whose character has been played by three different celebrities, that 'The Avengers' movie did not follow suit with what had happened in the prior movies. For instance, in the movie 'Thor' we last saw him trapped at his home land of Asgard, unable to come see Jane (his love) who is back on Earth. Yet in the movie 'The Avengers' he seems to be able to use his lightning bolt powers to magically come down with no explanation and join the rest of the crew in the future. Also when he did come down, he was not with the Avengers yet, he should have taken time to see her. Another thing I did not quit understand (this may be the fact that I do not read comics) is how the Hulk cannot control his anger when he is a raging green monster and he at first fights with anyone that is in a four foot radius but as the final battle scene rolls around he suddenly knows who is the enemy and who is not which also relates back to the fact that when we first meet him in 'The Avengers' he has himself hidden away someplace peaceful so he does not get angry and lash out. I just think that those might be some minor flaws in the story line.However, all around, I think that 'The Avengers' is a good movie. It has everything that a person could want out of a Marvel movie, which has been dishing out amazing stories for a long time. The choice of actors/actresses for each character and each movie makes up for the little 'umm,so wait, how did that happen?' with their personalities and the way they make it seem as though they have been those characters all their life. With all the flair the movie has, despite the leaks in the story line, I would give this movie an eight out ten.",Null,1,4,12 November 2012
