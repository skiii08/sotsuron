Angels & Demons," The Text, Vic ! ! ! Don't Say The Text ! ! !
","Monty Python used to do a comedy sketch in the 1970's called 'The Bishop', in which a crime-fighting clergyman would try to foil the pernicious plots and dastardly deeds of various criminal masterminds. The joke was that 'The Bishop' would always arrive ten seconds too late to save the victim and would then hilariously lament, 'We was . . . too late.' If you've seen that skit, then you've seen this movie. Super-Hero Symbologist (now there's a phrase you don't hear every day) Robert Langdon is pulled into a bizarro plot involving antimatter, flaming monks, and a centuries old cult trying to wipe out the Catholic Church. Langon spends the entire movie zooming around Vatican City in various sports-cars, helicopters, and police caravans only to see his mysterious shadowy foe emerge victorious time and time again because he was . . . too late.Not a horrible movie to be sure, but we have come to expect far more from people as gifted as Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. The film wants badly to evoke some of the grand mystery, horror and excitement of the earlier Hanks/Howard effort 'The DaVinci Code', but for this movie, it was . . . too late.",4,6,9,30 May 2009
Men in Black 3," 1)Old. 2)Tired. 3)Boring. (Pick any three)
","Let me explain. No, there is too much, Let me sum up.10 Will Smith shoots a bug.20 SPLAT!!! (Somebody, probably Will, gets slimed)30 Will Smith makes unfunny joke.40 Partner K doesn't laugh.50 Goto 10Because, Will Smith.., covered in slime.., joking.., and K not laughing. Will Smith, slime, joke, not laughing, get it?I'm pretty sure we get the not laughing part.The audience I was with to watch the movie sounded as if they had been stunned with a cattle prod.This seemed to go on for about 5 or 6 centuries, although I checked and the run time is only 103 minutes. So, I may have suffered a fatal brain aneurysm somewhere along the way.This movie seemed to feel that world was clamoring for another go at the first MIB movie except with the all of the humorous bits removed or made so painfully self aware that you feel like gawkers at a comedy ten car crash scene.We also got to again revisit the joke that every weird looking or weird acting person on the planet is a space alien. Because no matter how many thousands of times you do that joke, how could it ever NOT be funny? Am I right? Am I right? Am I right or am I right?Will Smith has apparently decided that he is such a bouncing off the walls, superfly, laugh-a-minute, comedy machine, that what has been lacking in his movies is not enough boring, uptight, straight white men to fail to laugh at his jokes. So both Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones get to play the steely faced, no nonsense, all business partner people types who will play total non-reaction so well when Will lets his full wacky out of the cage.We also get a love interest along the way. But it doesn't really matter who or when or where or why. Since the people and the plot points have become completely interchangeable and irrelevant at this point. The scenes play with all the raw animal magnetism of a flight attendant giving the seat belt lecture before takeoff.I like Will Smith, I like Tommy Lee Jones. I like Josh Brolin and Emma Thompson, I do, I really do.I enjoyed the first 'Men in Black' movie quite a bit and while the second one was not good, the reviews seemed to indicate that they had gotten back on track here.But the experience of watching this moving was like paying to watch oral surgery when there isn't enough knockout gas in the whole world to stop the pain. Check please!",1,12,28,26 May 2012
Star Trek," This Isn't Your Father's Star Trek
","Actually this isn't Star Trek at all.JJ Abrams has been doing the rounds of talk shows and news programs. Shilling for people to come out and watch his movie. I find it amazing that in every interview, he makes a special point to go out of his way to say that he didn't like Star Trek, he didn't watch Star Trek, he was never a fan of the show, he didn't know any of the history or mythology of the Star Trek universe and that he didn't really understand or care for the Star Trek phenomenon.Trust me. It shows.Abrams has made this new Star Trek movie with all the meticulous attention to detail and tender loving care that a McDonald's burger flipper puts into an Egg McMuffin. Slap it together, throw it at the customer, and grab their money before they notice you just served them a cold pile of pig fat.The characters seem to be genuinely confused and bewildered that they have stumbled into a Star Trek movie. Each character gets to utter one or two recognizable catch phrases. I suppose so that the audience can make an educated guess about which actor is supposed to be playing which role. They mouth their painful dialog with all the emotion and sincerity of a seventh grade debate team member who just dropped their index cards.The film is bad on so many levels, and so devoid of any possible connection to world of Star Trek, that it is difficult to imagine this is not intentional parody. If only Syler and Pine could have brought half the subtlety to Spock and Kirk that Chase and Belushi did, it would have been a better movie.Set design had all the verisimilitude of the psycho Trekkies who build Enterprise bridge sets in their living rooms. Special effects appear to have been pieced together on a old, broken down Amiga 2000, with the climactic battle taking place between the most pedestrian and geriatric Enterprise ever seen and a giant space tumbleweed. They producers loved this footage so much that showed it twice in the movie, for two different generations.The evil, creaky, leaky, fungus ship was crewed and captained by Romulan gangbangers, whose prime motivation seems to be that they wanted to get paid for appearing in the movie. (They should have asked for more money.) Star Fleet seem to have replaced the velour material of their uniforms with shower curtain material.Orci & Kurtzman, the Click and Clack of Hollywood writers have thrown together another two hour bathtub full of endless, pointless explosions and laser blasts without a semblance of logic or continuity. They no longer seem to feel the need to have any detectable plot or story come out of their work. Just write a script thin enough that Burger King can cover it on four collectible glasses and cash the check.The only grace note of this travesty was Leonard Nimoy. Returning one final time to hold a mirror up to humanities foibles, his Spock is always insightful, gentle, playful, and a tower of steely strength in the midst of disaster. He shows us why we liked Star Trek in the first place, and how little this rip off has to offer by comparison.R.I.P. Star Trek, you deserved a better sendoff than this.",2,137,214,8 May 2009
Terminator Salvation," I'll be back. - No, No, Please Don't
","The summer of my derivative, tired, clich√©d, vapid, stale, lifeless, trite, hackneyed, threadbare, timeworn, bland, weak, flat, pedestrian, banal, dull, insipid, uninspired, repetitive movie continues apace and unabated with 'Terminator: Assisted Living Community' Ahnold is too busy helping push California into foreclosure and bankruptcy to be the main star, so it falls to Batman, Checkov, and Jester to save the world from the evil, twisted, marauding special effects.I saw this movie at one of the midnight showing premieres, with a bunch of other hardcore Terminator fans. Christian Bale's ridiculous, menacing growl was so over the top hilarious that a good part of the audience was snickering or cracking up. Don't they have Hall's lozenges in the future? Apparently, Terminators are also Transformers, on the theory that you should steal from your competitors before they can push their own joke movie into theaters. Which leads to speculation that Terminators may also be Turbo Rangers, Tamagotchis, and Tinkerbells, but that's another story.This movie can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, EVER, until you are dead. You'll pray for someone to pull the plug on you.",2,2,4,30 May 2009
Justice League," Been There, Done That
","Well, once again we have the generic, boilerplate, superhero team flick. Team spends the first part of the movie unable to be a team. Then they finally and miraculously get it together just in time to fight the latest unstoppable big bad, who plans to destroy the city/country/continent/planet/galaxy/universe. I'm Shocked! Shocked I Say, that they pull together and pull though just enough and we find out the city/ country/continent/planet/galaxy/universe is safe until the next, even bigger bad, who is waiting their turn patiently to rain down destruction when the next installment drops in two years.At least this episode had a few obviously Whedonesque quipisms to drop into the tedium between the deadly dull plodding throughline Zack Snyder had deathmarched the audience into, but it was not enough to save us or the movie. I honestly felt like some of our protagonists should have been checking their watches an hour into the movie and asking, 'Can we go beat the bad guy already?' I am tired of this movie. I was tired of this movie when I saw this movie three movies ago.",3,73,145,16 November 2017
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Man of Steel, Part II (well that can't be good)
","My Mother always said, 'If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.' OK Ma, here goes, 'Wonder Woman'. (Long awkward pause and sound of crickets chirping in the silence.)In a movie that is composed of the worst parts of: Phantom Menace (Who doesn't love tedious Senate subcommittee hearings, like C-SPAN without the thrills.) Inception (Daydreams, Nightdreams, Nightmares, Dreams about Dreams, Thanks, with no Leto we're already all Requiemed out here.) Rock'em Sock'em Robots (Batman and Superman have to fight uhhhh . . . , because uhhhh . . . , (A) They have WMDs? (B) Soupy didn't like the sneezing powder gag gift Batty got him for their second date? (C) Batfleck was just all Tire'd out? (D) We just need something to justify all the expensive CGI (Yeah, I think we have a winner on the D-List.)In a movie that turns into one long exercise of 'Waiting for Gadot' BvS was tedious, verging on narcoleptic. Do yourself a favor and just watch the Trailers again. (All the best parts are already on display there, anyway.)Well, Vladimir, Estrogen and I are going to have a bit of a sit down and wait for 2017.",1,9,18,31 March 2016
