Alien 3," Disappointing when compared to the first 2
","Not in the same league as the first 2 Alien films. The special effects were well done, and while the action scenes were excellent, there weren't nearly enough of them. Nothing against director David Fincher, but I would not put him in the same class as Ridley Scott and James Cameron (directors of the first 2 films). This movie did not have a great flow. For the better part of an hour, we're left listening to dull dialogue, before the action picks up. At least with the first Alien film, the suspense kept up the pace of the movie. Also, aside from Lt. Ripley, none of the other characters are the least bit interesting in this film. This movie is enjoyable, and better than a many sci-fi movies out there, but I would not consider this one to be a classic.",6,309,322,4 October 2007
Predator," Typical Schwarzenegger Entertainment!!
","Predator starts off not all that differently than many other action movies of the 80's. You have a U.S. military group sent into the jungle of some South American country on a rescue mission. Two points, set this movie apart from those others. The first is the idea of bringing in a unique alien that hunts these soldiers and picks them off one at a time. The 'Predator' is unlike anything we had seen before. It's no wonder that this franchise continues to remain so popular today. The second point that makes this film so memorable is simply Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arnold is the master of action movies, the king of cheesy one-liners. He's the one guy that you could put in any movie, and you know he'll kick some serious ass. You're almost left feeling sorry for the alien in this movie, knowing that it's going to have to go up against Arnold. Predator has a great jungle setting, which enhances this suspense and the mood of the film. It is a superb blend of action and science fiction, and is enjoyable to watch anytime.",8,2,4,4 October 2007
Aliens," Masterpiece by James Cameron
","Just about everything about this movie; the cast, action, suspense, special effects, storyline, was just as good if not better than Alien. This was an overall tremendous effort by James Cameron. The only area where I thought this film lacked was in suspense. Don't get me wrong, there are certain scenes that will truly give you goose bumps, but overall there isn't that same eerie feeling as the first film. In 'Alien', there was just one alien, and you didn't know where and when it was going to show up. In Aliens, there is a whole army of these gruesome E.T.'s, almost to the point of overkill. Also, after watching the first film, we know what these Aliens look like and are capable of. Still, this film is a classic that combines the best of the sci-fi/horror/action genres.",8,1,2,4 October 2007
