E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," O.R. = Overrated
","I hate to play the 'heretic', but this flick is mildly entertaining, at best. It was, and is, about as much of a 'classic' as a Cabbage Patch Doll, or a 'Tickle Me Elmo'. If anything, it's a monument to MARKETING.",1,27,64,5 April 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Amazing
","I came to this film expecting to be bored, but now that I've watched it about 7 or 8 times all the way through, I'm amazed at how fantastic a movie it is. The cast is absolutely perfect...that's the only word for it. The story is totally entrancing, the locations and the sets are jaw-droppingly beautiful and mystical, and the screenplay is practically flawless. There is so much screen presence at work here: decades of great acting experience and faces that could only have played these parts. If the creators of this film can repeat the magic they captured here, then we may have a real milestone on our hands as movie fans. Don't let ANYONE tell you this movie wasted their time; that sounds more like a comment from a person who's lost their heart. 'Lord of the Rings' is exquisite.",10,1,1,23 September 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Great on several levels
","'The Two Towers' is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus I believe its new characters (those not introduced in 'Fellowship') are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. You have Gollum, King Theoden, Eowen, Faramir, Grima, Treebeard and many others. Peter Jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, I'll give no ground on that point. One might argue about Gollum and Treebeard's categorization as 'actors', but I say that whether they're CG or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. The existing characters are developed even more deeply in TT. Sam's humanity, Frodo's compassion, Aragorn's evolving kingship, Arwen's deep love, Gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. For epic 'sweep', you'll have to go far to match TT. The scenes at Helm's Deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of Sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and Jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. Gollum's split-personality conflicts as 'Smeagol/Gollum' are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! What a relief. Howard Shore's score is again one I'd buy for myself.I think that the main criticism of TT on this board is that the movie is dull, or that it relies too heavily on special effects. On the 'dullness' comment, I'd say that what's one viewer's 'dullness' is another's character development, dialogue, and foreshadowing. It's called 'filmmaking', along the lines of Kubrick and the Merchant/Ivory team. On the special effects comments, I'd counter that if special effects add to the plot and don't distract, then I'm perfectly OK with them. Now, I wouldn't be drawn to a film totally comprised of special effects, but TT is nothing like that. It's employment of them is only for the sake of plot and believeability. Would you want some guy playing Gollum, heavily made up, and totally false? No thanks. I bought the general release DVD yesterday, instead of waiting for the extended version, which I will purchase also. I only hope that TT's extended version is as fantastic as Fellowship's turned out to be.",10,2,3,29 August 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Masterpiece. But don't tell screenit.com
","First, I want to thank IMDB for allowing users to vote on films, rather than having a reviewer on staff. By the time a film receives tens of thousands of votes, it becomes clear that there is more to a movie than a die-hard core group of admirers could conjure up.Take your children to 'Return of the King'...then take them again. It's scary and chilling in some places, but those incidents are outweighed by the wonderful examples of leadership, bravery, dedication and undying hope, along with some gentle humor that (believe it or not) doesn't go the typical Hollywood route of being obnoxious or gross. It really is a film for all ages. Really. I can easily ignore the random IMDB user who dismisses the LOTR Trilogy because I know that those who sing its praises aren't all cave-dwellers who have to 'escape' to Middle Earth to feel alive. In fact, I'd bet that a lot of the film Trilogy's most devoted fans are people who have never read the books, but are responding to 3 of the most moving, beautiful, and memorable films ever made. LOTR speaks to the best parts of human nature: courage, loyalty, commitment, and true friendship, just to name a few. As a parent, I am indebted to PJ and his colleagues for bringing an uplifting and inspirational story to the screen; one I can bring my family to and not cringe every ten minutes. Yes, these are hobbitts, elves, dwarfs, wizards, humans and one very nasty eye, but the lessons are here and now; good for the home and for the world today. Most all agree. I've found that, almost without exception, the 'External Reviews' for LOTR as listed by IMDB, are 90% ecstatic, with the remaining 10% still conceding that the Trilogy is both exceptional and absolutely worth seeing. So, when I popped over to ScreenIt.com (which presents itself as a parents' guide to films), I was both amazed and disgusted that their invisible 'reviewer' had virtually nothing good to say about ROTK. The review was totally biased against all aspects of the movie. The site begrudgingly yielded the film a 6/10 rating, complaining all the way. As someone said here earlier: to those who rate LOTR 0/10, please cancel your registration to IMDB, for there simply is no intelligent way that a person can slam these movies across the board. And so I'm hoping to alert parents and moviegoers alike that not all 'professional' reviewers feel the need for objectivity or responsibility, even in this case, which seems clear-cut to most of us who have seen the films and who would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone who asked, or anyone who didn't ask as well!! I suppose that in the case of anything that is unabashedly positive, there are always those who (like Saruman) cannot resist the shadows. Time will prove that the Trilogy is a milestone and a masterwork. And then misguided websites with axes to grind will be exposed as lacking the basic credentials to be advising parents, or anyone else for that matter. Again, take your children to ROTK over these holidays and you'll have even one more reason to celebrate.",10,0,0,24 December 2003
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Brother, This is Excellent!
","I am still kicking myself for not seeing this film in the theater when it first came out. Oh well, at least I had the good sense to catch up with it on my local pay-per-view cable channel about a month ago. I can honestly say that I've only been surprised by a movie a few times, and this is one of those times. I saw George Clooney in 'The Perfect Storm', and thought he did a very good job in that film, but I wasn't prepared for what 'O Brother' had in store! I've seen 'Raising Arizona' and 'Fargo', and am definitely a Coen fan, but OBWAT is in a league ALL BY ITSELF. It's spirit is simple and poetic, its actors are dead-on, its screenplay is virtually flawless, its cinematography gorgeous, and its soundtrack is one that with have you humming/singing/whistling for a long time after. 'Surreal' is a word that comes to mind to describe many of the scenes. The escapees are 3 of the funniest characters you'll ever meet on film; Charles Durning as Gov. Pappy Lee O'Daniel makes me laugh just thinking about his portrayal, along with his 'advisors' and his rotund son, Junior; and all of the other supporting characters make for a superb collection of contributors to this rare jewel. I replay my tape of it to the auditorium scene over and over, just to savor the exuberant return of 'The Soggy Bottom Boys'. If you haven't seen OBWAT, you're missing a treat. 10/10",10,1,1,14 September 2001
