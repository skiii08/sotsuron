The Ring," Horrible
","This movie was simply aweful.  It was not scary, and there were way too many holes in the plot.  They didn't develop each of the story lines enough for the film to come together and make sense.  If the writers fully developed everything, the movie would be great.  But, as it is, the Ring is a great disappointment.",3,0,0,10 November 2002
