Iron Man 3," Disappointing. VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING!
","I hereby write a review in complete frustration after thinking about this movie. What did Shane Black do? OH GOD WHY?! The complete hype of Mandarin, the dark scene where Tony carried his suit, what I thought came out all disappointing. You think there's a Mandarin with 10 rings power? NO! The Mandarin is complete joke here. First of all, Here, Aldrich Killian says, 'I'm Mandarin'.. Aldrich Killian and the Mandarin were never the same person. I mean I was like 'Whaaa?' The part of me just got died when Tony enters in house looking for Mandarin. Why do they muck around with the already established story lines? They really should have kept to the basics of the Mandarin story line. In a word disappointing!The suits of Tony broke every time. I mean, the suits aren't suppose to be like these. Aren't the suits suppose to resist the thunders by Thor's and all stuff? One of the suit here just broke by Truck clashing. 'Whaaaa?!' In terms of story and comic book alignment, Ironman 3 is worst of the three movies.",1,145,285,26 April 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Transformed from better to excellence.
","I feel like cursing people who hated this movie. What kind of people are they who hated this movie? - People who watched Transformers just because of Megan Fox (Mikaela)or who didn't have clue what the hell was going on in this movie. First of all, they might be confused because they didn't even know who is who and who is doing what. For God's sake, have they even watched the G1? This is how it all works. From the Robot stories to their wars. Don't use your brain when watching this movie. Accept the fact that this might be possible before watching movie. Keep your brain at home and go watch the movie! Michael Bay did a fantastic job from direction to actors. All were fantastic! He even had discussion with James Cameron on 3-D effects. From my opinion, the 3-D effects were as good as Avatar. Let me make things clear. This movie is better than Revenge of the fallen. (Although I don't consider that movie terrible). Good story line. I recommend you to go and watch the movie or perhaps I shall Order you to GO WATCH THIS! Don't miss!",10,5,12,28 June 2011
