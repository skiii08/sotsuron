The King's Speech," The King's Speech rules!
","Hail to 'The King's Speech'! This is a triumphant and empowering movie about determination, courage, resiliency, leadership, but most of all friendship. For those of you have not heard 'The King's Speech', let me voice out the narrative for you. The film centers around King George VI of Britain's struggle with his speech impediment. The studerness of King George VI brings in the help of an unconventional but wily Speech Therapist, Lionel Louge. Director Tom Hooper is commended for not making the speech impediment as the sole narrative voice of 'The King's Speech'. The friendship between a lifelong lonely boy & man born into monarchy with a vivacious & clever family man who happens to have a gift in propelling others to reach their zenith provides the film its most entertaining & magnetic components; and that is what I loved the most of 'The King's Speech'. Not to say that I did not admire Colin Firth's virtuoso performance as King George VI or Geoffrey's Rush divine work as Louge. Firth and Rush are most deserving of all the accolades they have been receiving. The undervalued Guy Pearce also did a kingsman job himself with his supporting performance as the King's big bro David. However, I do have to say that Helena Bonham Carter's performance as Queen Mum Elizabeth is solid but not a monarchic one as many critics have hailed it to be. Screenwriter David Seidler, a former stutterer himself, contributes a resounding & inspirational scribe that is not in a loss for words. I am not the Firth to say that the 'The King's Speech' speaks volumes on the human spirit. ***** Excellent",10,1,2,17 January 2011
The Lobster," A Mastepiece Lobsterpiece!
","Please do not get clawstrophobic with my pun-filled review of the masterpiece independent film 'The Lobster'. I just don't sea, I mean see, a better movie coming out this year than 'The Lobster'. Director Yorgos Lanthimos has yorgone where few directors have gone to with his apex originality, creativity, and quirkiness of this gem of a film. 'The Lobster' stars an excellent Colin Farrell as David. His wife has just left him, and has to go to a hotel where they provide you 45 days to find a new mate. The rules of this futuristic dystopian society is that if mating is not made within 45 days, then the guests are transformed into an animal of their choice. David selects a Lobster because he loves the sea, they live to more than 100 years old, they are blue-blooded like aristocrats, and they always remain fertile! I have been saying this for years!!! At the hotel, David befriends two other male guests; a lisping quasi-looney dude, and an abrasive limping man. There are unorthodox occurrences that occur in the hotel that will leave you flabbergasted; either with bitter disgust because of its unconventionality or with cinematic euphoria due to its originality; I was hit wit the latter. So yea, 'The Lobster' is not for everyone to stomach. Rachel Weisz co-stars as the Short Sighted Woman, she is part of The Loners; a guerrilla-type group that guests in the hotel must hunt on. Consequently, David and the Short Sighted Woman meet and then the film becomes an insightful love story like you have never seen before; from near or far. Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou's screenplay of 'The Lobster' was a clawsic case of delight! It's as inventive as they come! I will boil with anger if 'The Lobster' screenplay is not nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar nomination during next year's award season! Moreover, Lanthimos also better land plenty of Best Director nominations for his phenomenal direction of the picture. Farrell has never been better, it is the best performance of his career with his perfect work as David. Also sensational was John C. Reilly as the Lisper and Ben Whishaw as the Limper. I also envision Weisz with much award accolade for her perfect performance as the short sighted woman. Other Lobster kudos acting feeds also go to Lea Seydoux as the Loner Leader, Angeliki Paupolia as the Heartless Woman, Ashley Jensen as the Biscuit Woman, Jessica Barden as the Nosebleed Woman, and Olivia Colman as the Hotel Manager. The Acting Lobsemble here is as good as it gets! So yes, I am a 'The Lobster' lover, and it has clawed its way to my cinematic tops! ***** Excellent",10,0,6,10 June 2016
Moneyball," Had a ball watching Moneyball!
","I am ready to spill the beans on the baseball management flick 'Moneyball'. So let me pitch it to you, because it's a good one. Director Bennett Miller's film adaptation of the true story of Oakland A's General Manager Billy Beane's creative non-spending architecture of putting a winning team in the field without spending the big dough is sure to have its own winning streak during movie awards season. The Beane computer-generated player analysis technique has been a trendsetter that many other Major League Baseball clubs have used. 'Moneyball' is set during the 2002 Oakland A's season who many thought was going to be an 'F' graded one for the Athletics. Beane me up some Brad! Because Brad Pitt's exemplary starring performance as Billy Beane does not have to be computer-analyzed to prove that it's as solid as they come for a leading actor this year. Mr. Pitt is no longer the pretty boy actor, his work throughout the last few years have proved that he is one of the best actors in the business; besides being sought after by many Major League Studios in Hollywood. 'Moneyball' sure had a lot of Miller time on it, maybe not personally on screen but on development; because Director Bennett Miller's acute management of the movie gets my vote as an all-star auteur effort for 2011; and Miller's fluid direction authenticated the fact that you don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy this film, because its major narrative hit is showcasing how to deliver a winning product with budget restrains. Hall of Fame screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian did threw a few curve balls and did change it up a bit in their 'Moneyball' script enough to base it as what can be the premier screenplay of the year. The supporting players of 'Moneyball' also brought their A game! Jonah Hill was spectacular as Beane's economic-wiz apprentice Peter Brand. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was a piece of art as A's Manager Art Howe. And Chris Pratt brought the right balance of nervousness and opportunity as A's player Scott Hatterberg. But overall this was mainly Pitt's playing thespian field and he sure made the best of every opportunity he got up at the acting plate. 'Moneyball' may or may not roll large amounts of moneyballs in the box office, but it is definitively 'so money' and I hope everybody knows it. ***** Excellent",Null,0,0,26 September 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Cool Bill to Play!
","Pump up the volume! Pump up the volume! Pump up the volume! Kill Bill!That is what masterful director Quentin Tarantino does in the exhilarating 'Kill Bill Volume 2'. Various questions are answered in this version so there is no doubt that you will get your kicks out of Volume 2. Uma Thurman returns as 'The Bride', the vengeful martial arts master who continues her quest to, you got it, kill Bill. Those of you who experienced Volume 1, know that she had her 'Bill of Rights' to do that after what Sir William did to her in the dress wedding rehearsal. Along her vengeful voyage, she still possesses the need to liquidate some of Bill's associates: Budd (a.k.a. Swidewinder) & Elle Driver (a.k.a. California Mountain Snake). Tarantino budd, I mean bud, Michael Madsen was cool as a Bud Light with his performance. Daryl Hannah as the California Mountain Snake was venomous with her sly work also. Both are deserving of Supporting Actor noms. However, let's kick it up a notch; the sharpest supporting work of 'Volume 2' was beheaded by no other than the 'King Fu' himself David Carradine as Bill. Let's not forget about our temperamental bride: Uma Thurman should get her comeuppance by being nominated for a Best Actress Oscar after being snubbed for Volume 1. Memo to the Academy: You do not want to p*ss her off! Just ask Bill! Volume 2 does have its arduous lapses but it is incorporated for the sake of the story. Tarantino's ingenious dialogue is what still drives his films, and it is no different here in 'Kill Bill: Volume 2'. So get up and go biller blading by viewing 'Kill Bill: Volume 2'. **** Good",8,0,1,6 September 2004
Black Swan," Take a ride in this dark Swanee River!!
","Director Darren Aronofsky does not mind to step on anybody's toes when it comes to demonstrating that he can outperform other auteurs in orchestrating movies starring obsessed 'go to the extreme for their profession' characters. Probably due to the fact the Aronofsky does the same himself in his craftsmanship of his pictures. Aronofsky's latest gem is the psychosexual 'Black Swan' which uses the ballet as the backdrop. Natalie Portman stars as Nina Sayers, an apprehensive but driven ballet dancer in a New York company who gets the lead in a new version of the legendary 'White Swan'. Nina lives with her controlling mother Erica, and this Erica wants 'all her children' (which would be just Nina) to reach supremacy in the ballet arts. Nina is the little ni√±a of Erica and she won't let her forget it. The ballet company's artistic director is Thomas Leroy, who pushes Nina to the edge by insisting that Nina demonstrate reckless & impulsive behaviors in order for her to take a trip to the dark side to aid her in her 'black swan' performance within the 'white swan' ballet. Thomas makes a few sexual moves of his own on Nina for her to unveil a hidden aggressiveness or maybe for her to be the '(rhymes with luck)swan' to him. Yea Baby! OK, enough. Nina's ballet rival is Lily, the spontaneous little bombshell who may or not may not be a swan figment of Nina's imagination. In fact, there are numerous scenes in 'Black Swan' that Aronofsky showcases Nina's extreme mania to excel by inserting hallucination or non-hallucination visions that Nina experiences. Aronofsky does push the envelope at times within those scenes but at the same time it displays his forte expertise of exhibiting determined & semi-delusional protagonists. There is no black & white (or maybe there was) when it comes to Mark Heyman & Andre Heinz' masterful screenplay of 'Black Swan', it will effectively engage you in the 'WTF' process. Portman's audacious leading performance as Nina will very well show the Academy that 'she was perfect' and they will most probably hand her a Best Actress Oscar. The supporting acting of 'Black Swan' demonstrated that they were almost perfect themselves; Mila Kunis was captivating as the wily Nina, Barbara Hershey reached over the veteran actress bar as the overprotected mommy Erica, and Vincent Cassel was powerfully enigmatic as the 'no holds barred' ballet director Thomas. Hey, even Winona Ryder was a scene-stealer (did I just include Winona and stealer in the same sentence?) with her show-stopping performance as a jealous veteran ballet dancer. 'Black Swan' was not perfect but it's the only time in my life that I have immensely enjoyed anything remotely close to the ballet. **** Excellent",9,2,7,19 December 2010
Changeling," A great 2008 film found!!!!!!!!!
","Hollywood legend Clint Eastwood does not change much does he? He continues his non-changing hot streak of directing emotionally powerful films in his twilight time. His latest 'Changeling' stars Angelina Jolie as Christine Collins, a single mom in 1920's Los Angeles whose son goes missing and then found by the L.A.P.D., but it turns out that the boy located is not her real son. The film is based on a true story, but I guess Clint did have to make a few changelings for dramatic enhancement touches. 'Changeling' channels itself into such themes as: police corruption, despicable murders, and mental institutionalism. Jolie's performance should not be missing from the list of top female acting efforts of the year. It would be another case of corruption in L.A. if Jolie is not nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award. The supporting thespian performances of the film were the right ones found for Oscar consideration: Me gusta John Malkovich's work as Rev. Gustav Briegleb, an advocate on fighting police corruption; Jason Butler Harner was monstrously amazing as the loathsome Gordon Northcott; Amy Ryan is not yet 'gone baby gone' from strong acting with her wicked performance as psych ward patient Carol Dexter; Jeffrey Donovan as 'bad cop' Captain Corrupter J.J. Jones was commanding; and Michael Kelly was solid as 'good cop' Detective Lester Ybarra. OK, I will stop playing 'good cop, bad cop'. Hey, but you know what 'Kids Are Good Actors Too'. The child actors in the film were phenomenal and should have plenty of 'changelings' in their pockets and bling-bling on their necks & wrists for years to come! So acting kids' kudos goes out to: Gattlin Griffith as Walter Collins, Eddie Alderson as Sanford Clark, and the rest of their child thespian colleagues of 'Changeling'. Let's change the subject of 'Changeling' and get technical! Because the cinematography, art direction, costumes, sound, sound editing, and score (by none other than Eastwood himself) of the film are all worthy to be found and not missing from the Academy Awards nomination list for their respected categories. Scriber J. Michael Straczynski effectively put the word out on 'Changeling' with sturdy emotional pathos that will leave you uneasy but in tuned. Lastly, one cannot ignore that Hollywood God Eastwood was the proficient main orchestrator of 'Changeling' and I think the Academy will 'make his day' once again by nominating Clint for Best Director. So change your plans today and allocate some time to locate 'Changeling' at your nearest theatre. ***** Excellent",9,6,10,11 November 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The strange tide is not high, but it does the trick, thanks to its Depp waves!
","It is not a total shi*wreck like the last two installments, but 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' does not totally hook you in; even though it did have its moments. Johnny Depp returns as everyone's favorite pirate Captain Jack Sparrow in this fourth film of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise. In this installment, Jack is on a mission to find the 'fountain of youth', which seems like the 48 year-old Depp has already found. Sparrow is confronted by an ex-girlfriend Angelica Malon, which I am sure Jack la 'piratio' from a fellow pirate. Angelica is portrayed by none other than Spanish bombshell Penelope Cruz, who actually does have some chemistry with Depp. Ms. Malon also happens to be the daughter of the pirate nemesis Blackbeard, played with a chilling disposition by Ian McShane. Blackbeard is also on the quest to find the Mr. De Leon 'oil of olay' waters. Speaking of beards, Sparrow foe & occasional ally Captain Barbossa is back for this one, even though Captain B is gunning more to shave off Blackbeard than Sparrow in this chapter. Geoffrey Rush continues to give the Barbossa character that good ol' pirate swagger no matter the circumstances. There are even mermaids in 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' which swimmingly look great but they don't provide much of a 'fin' to the movie. I personally do not think that the character of Sparrow has worn out his welcome, and is still the best part of the franchise, and we have another Depp vibrant performance to thank for that. However, I still grrrr about the film's cheesy narrative elements when it does not have to be. Yes, Director Rob Marshall did not heavy-hand it as much as Gore Verbinski's last two Pirate films, but the 'fountain of youth' storyline was more of a bore than a score, and after a while it really got old. Nevertheless, I did enjoy the action sequences and the introduction of Blackbeard into the movie totally rocked the house or at least the boat. I was elated that the hideous characters of Will & Elizabeth were finally axed out from the franchise. It is still Depp running the acting show here, so as long as we are not Depprived of the charismatic Johnny D. playing Captain Jack, then keep those pirate movies coming; but I do plead to the filmmakers to please spice up the plot. All in all, this swashbuckling flick is not GRRRRReat but not bad!! *** Average",Null,0,1,12 June 2011
Frost_Nixon," Read my review of 'Frost/Nixon', I promise I am not a critic crook!
","'Frosty the Hostman was a very busy nose-body, he wanted to get the ex-Prez Nixon to confess and to come back to life some day.' Maybe that is not the ideal mature way to describe the plot of Director Ron Howard's 'Frost/Nixon', but it does give some precise insight on the film. 'Frost/Nixon' is based on the infamous interviews between British talk show host David Frost and former President Richard Nixon which took place a few years after Nixon's resignation due to that little water-spill people call Watergate. Veteran actor Frank Langella commands screen presence with his presidential performance as Richard Nixon, and Michael Sheen continues his steady acting play portraying influential figures caught up in government scandals with his charismatic performance as Frost. The goal of Team Frost was to get Richard Nixon to confess or as one of the Team Frost members states 'give Nixon the trial he never had'. The interviews took place in 1977 which were a couple of years after Nixon resigned. The former President was living a tranquil life with his wife during that time; but he was sickened to be held down to incongruent public speaking gigs. He wanted to be back in the limelight so he accepted Frost's offer for the interviews; and it did not matter that Nixon also got a hefty paycheck from all of this. They do not call him Tricky Dick for nothing. Team Frost consisted of Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr., two investigative reporters who were consumed and fixated on a Nixon conviction; in addition Frost's producer John Brit was also a major player in Team Frost. I especially liked Sam Rockwell's restless performance as Reston Jr. The hottest Team Frost member had to be (by a long-shot) Caroline Cushing, a nice cushy intellect beauty that Frost meets in a plane and inadvertently becomes part of 'the high mile club', I mean part of Team Frost. The up-an-coming Rebecca Hall does some nice work here as Cushing. Speaking of fine acting and its degree, it now leads me to Kevin Bacon; his degree of acting connected again with viewers by his portrayal of Nixon aide Jack Brennan. The set of interviews which took place between Frost and Nixon never did reveal an actual confession from Nixon, but there were definitely physical and verbal signs of lifelong regret from Richie Rich. Tricky Dick did shoot a few verbal jabs at Frost during the first interview, but then Frost kept his cool and made a nice comeback during the latter interviews. What caused Frost to power up? Was it verbal steroids? Was it verbal sabotage or blackmail? Watch the movie and you will find out. Screenwriter Peter Morgan and Director Ron Howard proved they can 'talk the talk and walk the walk' within their praiseworthy film-making exertion in devising the realistic Frost/Nixon interview scenes of the film. I also liked how Howard carried the film into other areas as in the media's inner workings, the fixation to protect superiors at all costs, and how insignificant daily rituals can have mammoth impacts. 'Frost/Nixon' did drag at times but the man Nixon himself was also a bit of a drag. 'Frost/Nixon' does not get my vote as the best film of the year, but is one you should not resign yourself from viewing. **** Good",8,2,7,19 January 2009
Walk the Line," Country Licking Good!
","I think I am not being out of line when I state that 'Walk The Line' will be one of the most celebrated films of 2005. This Johnny Cash bio should cash in a few Oscar nominations for its lead actors, writers, and director. The film does primarily focus on Johnny Cash's relentless romantic pursuit of June Carter. It is not created as a love story but more as a man's willingness to romance a woman he has enduring love for. I will 'Cry, Cry, Cry' if Joaquin Phoenix & Reese Witherspoon are not nominated for Oscar acting nominations. The Phoenix does rise up here from his acting ashes with a vociferous & breathtaking performance as Cash. Joaquin even perfects the Cash sound by doing his own singing; sound like money in the Cash vocal bank to me. Hey June, could anybody could have perfected your part better than the flawless Reese Witherspoon? Witherspoon also masters the June Carter persona and voice 'withhertune' too. Director James Mangold might see another 'mangold' in a Best Director Oscar statuette in the near future. His arty direction of 'Walk the Line' puts him in line in as one of the deserving candidates for a Best Director nomination. The musical sequences of the film deserve a high note as one of the optimum ever captured in film. The buzz has already started on how hot this film is , or in other words the 'ring of fire' has already been chained for 'Walk The Line'. So line up at your local movie theatre for this linear narrative that is 'Walk the Line'. It will be cash well spent! ***** Excellent",10,4,10,20 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat definitely not boring
","Borat is definitely one of the most dreary, mind-numbing characters I have ever witnessed in cinema. (Pause) NOT!!!!!!!!!!Borat's film is remotely but not too offensive to such groups as the Jews, the feminists, the upper class, the African-Americans, and the male university students. (Pause) NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!Sasha Baron Cohen is a amateurish comedian/actor who does not invoke any creativity, outlandishness, and vivacity into his Barot role.

The Incredible Hulk," Inject this other Hulk movie with originality steroids!
","THE INCREDIBLE HULKNo Way! (Meeza's nostrils turn green!). You did not like my pun-infested movie reviews as the next one I will be throwing at you! (Meeza's shirt opens up while it pulsates as his entire body turns into a dark green complexion!). You thought the reviews were silly and a bit over-the-pun-top!!! (AAAHH!! Meeza is a pun green monster filled with rage & revenge!) OK, so these type of comments do make me angry! And you would not like me when I am angry, or maybe you would because I do not pun as much when I am angry. What also made me angry at times was viewing another mostly unsuccessful cinematic takeoff of the Marvel hero 'The Incredible Hulk' story. Director Ang Lee's 2003 Hulk did break many backs but also showed Hulk as a silly crouching monster, hidden dragon; Sorry Ang! In this latest adaptation, Director Louis Leterrier does improve the Hulk story with a bit more power by giving it an alternative narrative but not enough to have a Hulkian cinematic effect. The steady Eddie, Edward Norton, stars as Dr. Bruce Banner (alter-ego Hulk). Leterrier quickly presents a five minute montage on why & how scientist Banner transformed himself into Hulk when he gets angry during the film's opening sequence. So kudos to Louis for getting those anger issues quickly out of the way. The rest of the film fixates on the cloistered Banner's quest to get the Hulk out of his system. Banner is being chased by arrogant General Thunderbolt Ross and his men to get the Hulkian formula out of poor Bruce to use it for weaponry defense purposes. The Thunderbolt eventually finds where the lightning Banner is hiding and therefore Banner returns back to the States. The good thing for Banner is that he has a banner time reuniting with his love Betty Ross; she even knits a Hulk flag for him and this Ross undresses for less for Bruce. OK, enough! General Ross is so livid that he cannot hunt down Banner that he eventually causes for one of his men Emil Blonsky to convert himself to another gargantuan creature named 'Who Cares? It's Big, Scary, and Ugly' to battle & defeat Hulk. By the way, that is not the real name of Hulk's nemesis; but at that point I was not engaged in the whole formulaic monster battle between good vs. evil that most superhero films climax with. I do think that Norton was the right man for the Hulk acting job with his excellent performance. But the rest of the cast made me angry with their acting, and you would not like me when I am (ok, been there, said that). Liv Tyler as Ross, William Hurt as the General, and Tim Roth as Blonsky seemed were just doing their acting gigs to just collect the green. I was at a loss for words on how awful Zak Penn's harebrained loss-of-words screenplay was. Not good Pennmanship my dear Zak. 'The Incredible Hulk' did have some action sequences that were a bit entertaining, but not enough originality was injected in the film to make me feel green with envy that I did not catch it during its original theatrical run. Therefore, I continue to have anger management issues with Hulk movies. *** Average",Null,1,3,5 September 2009
Requiem for a Dream," Wow!!!!!!!!
","I have requested filmmakers to make a movie about the loathsome feeling of addiction and finally my dream has come true. That would be in the spectacular new film `Requiem for a Dream.' The film follows four different drug addicts in their downward spiral to substance hell. The breathtaking visuals by director Darren Aronofsky are the best I have seen in film this year. The cast gets very high and I mean very high marks: Ellen Burstyn's name should `pop' up in the best actress oscar nominee list, Jared Leto's formerly mediocre `so-called' acting is now a thing of the past because of his extraordinary performance, Jennifer Connelly not only stimulates us with her beauty but also demonstrates that her acting skills are not of a hallucinogenic nature, and Marlon Wayans  shows us in living color that he could also be a pretty good dramatic actor. However, it is director Aronofsky who is the master dream weaver of this film. It would be a downer if he does not get nominated for a best director oscar. Why? You said! Because everything in his film is full of uppers! ***** Excellent",9,0,0,27 November 2000
Captain Phillips," Yes Captain!!!
","Look at me, look at me (well maybe you can't) but I am the pun captain now. Because I am going to hold you hostage with a plethora of puns in yet another film review voyage upon my pun-man ship. Please don't jump off!! OK, I am going to bring you my insight of the masterful movie 'Captain Phillips'. The film is based on the real life 2009 incident where cargo ship capitan Richard Phillips was taken hostage on a cargo lifeboat by four Somali pirates. Tom Hanks pitch-perfect starring performance as the title character was on board as one of the best acting efforts of the year. It's too bad the Academy rocked the boat when they left Hanks off the Best Actor Oscar nominee list. Newcomer Somalian actor Barkhad Abdi's freshman effort as the Somalian pirate leader Muse was a gem. Abdi's facial expressions alone were worthy of all the acting accolades his performance has received. Director Paul Greengrass has once again proved that the green is always richer on our side when he is orchestrating suspense action films based on true stories. Greengrass anchors 'Captain Phillips' quite swiftly, just as he perfectly piloted 'United 93'. Billy Ray's screenplay was very compelling and included what probably is the movie catchphrase of the year 'I'm the captain now'. So whether you pirate this movie or not (recommending the latter of course), you should take a look at 'Captain Phillips'. ***** Excellent",10,0,1,29 January 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," This Wallflower blossoms!
","These are the perks of being a pseudo film critic. I can write about any movie, at any time. So therefore, I am going to provide you some perks that you can receive by watching the coming-of-age flick 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'. First perk- you will be vastly entertained with Writer-Director Stephen Chbosky's film about Charlie, an introverted high school freshman in Pittsburgh who is befriended by a group of eclectic seniors. They include Patrick, the popular vocal one who is gay; Sam, the pretty gal who has had a bad run with boyfriends in the past; and Mary Elizabeth, the punky Buddhist who takes a romantic liking to Charlie. However, Charlie has his sights on Sam. Charlie did have a traumatic event as a child which is not disclosed until the latter part of the movie; and eventually this situation led to psychological challenges for Charlie. Second perk- Chbosky, who adapted the screenplay from his novel, directs the picture in a method reminiscent of John Hughes classic 80's teen movies; which authenticate the ordeals and challenges that teens go through, and verify that it's not just about fun & games for them. Third perk- Chbosky's screenplay was immensely ingenious and endearing, and very worthy of a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination. Fourth perk- Logan Lerman's astute performance as Charlie just might give him a Logan's run to more high-profile acting gigs in his career. Fifth perk- Ezra Miller's work as Charlie was probably the best performance by a young actor in a movie this year. This young actor keeps proving that it's about Miller time for him to move up the Hollywood thespian letter with premier starring performances. Sixth perk- Emma Watson proves that she does not need a Potter by her side to demonstrate her acting skills; she was debonair & articulate in her work as Sam. Seventh perk- the movie is set in the 80's, but it incorporates some of today's major teen issues transposed in that time. Eight perk- the killer soundtrack that includes great tunes especially the premier song of the film which would be the inspiring classic 'Heroes' from David Bowie. Ninth perk- there is even a Paul Rudd sighting in the movie, his restrained and effective performance as Charlie's high school English teacher was an added plus to this unpretentious film. Tenth perk- after you see this movie, you will feel just as good as watching 'The Breakfast Club' for the 200th time. The premier line of the movie is 'we are infinite', and lucky for you this review isn't. Nevertheless, I hope I provided you enough selling perks to locate your perking space to check out 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'. ***** Excellent",9,3,6,29 December 2012
3:10 to Yuma," Take the '3:10 to Cine' to see '3:10 To Yuma'
","Do not be a train wreck by missing the exhilarating western '3:10 To Yuma'. It is quite the entertaining western that we have been waiting for. Director James Mangold struck gold in his delivery of this remake of the 1957 western starring Glenn Ford. Mangold was quite fortunate to lasso thespian megastars Russell Crowe and Christian Bale in the title roles this time around. Bale plays Dan Evans, a crestfallen rancher who is so broke that $3.10 is about the estimated total cash he has on him to support his worried wife and his two melancholic kids. Crowe plays Ben Wade, the wily outlaw who leads a posse that robs armed stagecoaches carrying lots of 'Big Ben Franklins' for Big Ben Wade to steal. Wade's luck runs out when he is captured by lawmen in the desolate western town of Bisbee. The 'financial desperado' Evans is then hired by the Bisbee lawmen to join a posse which will take the baddie Wade to the town of Contention in order for put him on the 3:10 to Yuma train; that will lead him to Yuma jail for an eventual hanging. Let's just say that they want Wade to hang it high as the basketball Wade does when he dunks the ball. Anyway, Evans accepts the offer and what follows is a cerebral & physical duel between Evans & Wade that is quite the roundup I have been waiting for in a suspenseful & creative western. Along for the 'take Wade to the 3:10 to Yuma ride' is Peter Fonda playing Byron McElroy, a former grungy outlaw who joins the Bisbee entourage because he himself despises Wade; Kevin Durand as Tucker, a loudmouth cowboy; Alan Tudyk as Doc Potter, the town veterinarian who is used to hanging out with a bunch of desperate old dogs himself; and Dallas Roberts as Grayson Butterfield, the railroad lawman who is as soft in the inside as butter itself. Not exactly the dream team of Western Bad-Asses; which does make it easy for the clever Wade to always be in contention to escape on his way to Contention. However, I will hold my guns here because to say more would be a misfire in adequately reviewing the film with no spoilers. Ben Foster plays Charlie Prince, Wade's right hand man (no not Shaquile O' Neal) whose devilish demeanor is western bloodcurdling at its apex. Yes, this Prince definitely does 'go crazy'. Let's just say that Prince and his bandit posse will go to any means to save their boss Wade. Many of the acting performances of '3:10 to Yuma' are deserving of Oscar nominations at the Kodak Corral. Crowe and Bale were simply brilliant as Wade & Evans and will probably be dueling out again in the Best Actor category in numerous award shows. Foster means 'American for Best Supporting Actor nomination' for his wicked work as the monstrous Prince. I was also fond of Fonda's fun acting as MCelroy. Logan Lerman who plays Dan Evans' son William was also a nice addition to this winning acting posse. Director Mangold 'walks this western line' with a triumphant psychological western touch that makes the '3:10 To Yuma' the yummiest cinematic experience of the year. ***** Excellent",10,1,3,18 September 2007
Ali," Stunk like a butterlfy, but 'Mann' floated like a bee!
","The slogan of the new biopic `Ali' is ¬ñ forget what you know. After seeing `Ali' it should be more like `forget what you saw'. The film's very lightweight screenplay & dreary story-line made me throw in the towel halfway through the movie. Even though the film is based on one imperative part of Muhammad Ali's courageous life, it did not develop his character in full by showing his childhood and his eventual knockdown of obtaining Parkinson's Disease. However, I must vote a unanimous decision on Director Michael Mann's boxing sequences direction. His one-two punch direction style of slow motion shots and integrating close-ups were a winning combination. Michael's direction `mannerisms' do get you `hooked' into the film a bit. I also do commend Will Smith as Ali who flied as a butterfly with his impersonating dialogue and Jon Voight as Howard Cossell who stung like a bee with his masterful mimicry.  Even though the film as well-acted and its boxing sequences were wonderfully directed, it was the screenplay's deficient technicalities that resulted in  `Ali' losing by a tko (technical knockout). *** Average",6,0,1,13 May 2002
Skyfall," It's time to Bond again!
","I did not fall in love as much with 'Skyfall' as others did, but I still did bond with it enough to enjoy it. The latest James Bond chapter 'Skyfall' brings back some of those momentous Bond features, and also for the first time examines his childhood. In 'Skyfall', Bond's operative mission is the capture of a high-tech villain named Silva who has his sights on not only terrorizing the MI6 but also seeking vengeance against the captain of the MI6 ship, which of course is the one that sits between L and N; which would be M. Did you get my letters? Anyways, Silva does have a past with the MI6, which I won't share too much in order not to shake & stir this review with too many spoiler points. Silva is the 21st Century Villain, a techy madman who in just a stroke of a key can cause massive havoc. Director Sam Mendes does carry out his directorial operative mission well with the fast-paced action of 'Skyfall', and its background checks on the pasts of Bond and even M. The three-headed Screenplay team of Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan did not shoot blanks with their scribe of 'Skyfall'. Daniel Craig is again proving to be a formidable James Bond, and was glad to see some of that sly Bond humor return with his 'Skyfall' thespian effort. The great Judi Dench was marvelous as M. Javier Bardem's juicy bad-boy performance as Silva deserved every 'Silva' dollar you paid to see it. Ralph Fiennes delivered another fine performance in his brilliant acting resume as M's superior Gareth Mallory. And we also had a young GQ I mean Q in the picture with Ben Whishaw's stellar work as that infamous MI6 gadget master. And there has to be a Bond girl mentioned here somewhere, so therefore I must state that Naomie Harris was money as agent Eve. Adele's 'Skyfall' song is the best Bond tune in the last two decades. Even though 'Skyfall' had all these positives, I do not think it was the best Bond film and still have more of a liking to 'Casino Royale' in the 'Craig as Bond' era of the franchise. Nevertheless, witnessing the 'Skyfall' is still a mission that you should accept. **** Good",8,1,4,28 December 2012
50 First Dates," Undateable!
","Here are 50 reasons why I should have stood up `50 First Dates':1) Adam Sandler was no Mr. Sandman as an island gigolo who falls for an amnesiac who cannot remember her experiences of the previous day (which scarcely enough resembles my monthly series entitled `50 Last Hangovers'.)2) `Who plays the amnesiac?' you ask.  I forgot! Why? Because her performance did not cause enough brain chemical reaction to transfix itself in my cerebral cortex. Ok! I will stop brainwashing you on the negativity of her performance and tell you who it is: Drew Barrymore.
3) Director Peter Segal, who also guided the disciples `Anger Management' & `The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps', is no directorial professor and actually needs to take some courses on director management.4) George Wing's vapid screenplay is of the not-right wing party group.
5-50) it sucks! It sucks! It sucks! It sucks! Now `copy' and `paste' the previous phrase 43 more times!Please do not set a date to view `50 First Dates'! ** Needs Improvement",4,2,6,5 July 2004
The Young Victoria," Lavish costume design & art direction, and Blunt was impressive, but that is it, period!
","The British Queen Victoria was infamous not only for her long run of sovereignty but also because she took the throne at a young age. Many thought she was an inexperienced spoiled child who would not be capable of such responsibility. No, this is not The George Bush Story. Queen Victoria showed all her naysayers and her country that she was a powerful and endearing leader. The first years of her rule are chronicled in the period movie 'The Young Victoria'. Emily Blunt stars as the titled character, and she continues to prove most worthy of her acting range and that she thespian rules! Director Jean Marc Valee' assembles the movie more as a love story than a power monarchy struggle. In other words, Valee' parks the narrative mostly as Victoria's relationship with Prince Albert. But nevertheless, 'The Young Victoria' still has plenty of the formulaic reign jealousy that is incorporated in most period movies. So I am sorry Jean Marc, but maybe you should Valee' your period movie creativity in unchartered historical waters. In other words, develop something that has not been included in this genre for your next period flick. The 'Young Victoria' is based on a true story and you cannot defy history but you can spice it up with a little novelty for viewer enchantment. Jean Marc, I would give the same advice to your fellow filmmaker Julian Fellowes, who scripted 'The Young Victoria'. Fellowes' past scripts have been a bit more jovial and less melancholy, so maybe its time for Julian to be once again a 'jolly good' Fellowes in his screen writing contributions. Blunt was impressive but the rest of the cast was a bit too robotic for my taste; which included: Rupert Friend as Prince Albert, Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mommy), and Paul Bettany as Lord Melbourne. Lord o lord, must these actors always use the same expression throughout the movie! I did enjoy the always charismatic Jim Broadbent as King William, but he was very much underutilized. I must coronate 'The Young Victoria' with some positive feedback on its vibrant art direction and opulent costume design; but then again those are pretty much sure things when it comes to period flicks. 'The Young Victoria' is what it is, not a victorious movie but a divine pleasure to history buffs and those who love a period love story ('Carrie' not included). *** Average",7,1,2,21 December 2010
The Hangover," Hang with this one! A gagfest!
","Unrememberable, that is what Hangovers are; Unrememberable, through beers and bars. My apologies to Nat King Cole! We have all had them, we can't stand them, but is a part of 'paying the piper' for the few vivacious hours of liquid festive madness from the previous night! Hangovers!!! I think Hollywood was overdue in providing us a comedic film about them! Maybe they got hung up with the premise! But finally they gave it to us and they did not barf it up with the winning comedy 'The Hangover'. Let me throw you up the plot of this gem: Three groomsmen and their about-to-be-wed buddy go to Las Vegas for a stirring bachelor party. Phil is the cocky ringleader of this Vegasfest and also the best friend of the groomie Doug. Stu is the neurotic Dentist buddy who gives his possessive girlfriend muela by lying about where the boys are going for the bachelor festivities. Alan is Doug's soon-to-be brother-in-law who's probably gone over the hangover threshold zillions of times in his life thereby explaining his outlandish behavior. So these fearsome foursomes drink it up in Sin City and before you know it- Hangover Helper gets a service call! They wake up the morning after with chaos colliding in their not-so-little Caesars Palace suite- A tiger in the bathroom, a stolen police car, a baby in the closet, a hanging mattress, a broken tooth, and a missing Doug. Obviously, their alcohol-induced memory banks are at zilch so it is oblivious to Phil, Stu, and Alan how this happened. So consequently, they need to retrace last night's itinerary of events to find the lost Doug. I will not seltzer you up (whatever that means) with more details, so you just gotta hang on tight & witness this zany mayhem that is 'The Hangover'. Director Todd Phillips does phil up this comedic adventure Vegas ride with side-splitting, off-beat material that makes you crave for a longer Hangover running time! Bradley Cooper as Phil had the adequate charismatic pizazz in portraying him. Zach Galifianakis was very Belushish as the deranged Alan. Justin Bartha as Doug was not a barfa of laughs in his supporting role, but walked this acting aisle admirably. But my favorite thespian performance here was that of Ed Helms as Stu; Helms stewed it up just right with a perfect blend of comedic acting ingredients. So the remedy for your cinematic blues is to catch 'The Hangover' before it gets out of your must-see system. ***** Excellent",10,3,6,14 June 2009
Stop-Loss," A Win for 'Stop-Loss'
","There is no loss of masculinity testosterone in the Iraq War theme film 'Stop-Loss'. It stars cinematic heartthrobs Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Director Kimberly Peirce's poignant 'peirce of work' on the mental psyche of the American soldier post Iraq combat duty is probably the best of the platoon of Iraqi movies so far; even though I still have not unlocked and checked out the critically acclaimed 'The Hurt Locker'. In 'Stop-Loss'- Phillippe stars as Sgt. Brandon King, a multiple-duty served soldier who returns to his Texas hometown after his last tour only to discover a short time after that he has been 'stop-lossed' to serve once again. Undoubtedly, King is at a loss for words on hearing the disastrous news but nothing is going to stop him to evade another Iraqi nightmare. Therefore, he decides to win the 'stop-loss' AWOL style by taking a road trip to seek assistance from a U.S. Senator to the nation's capital. King's travel companion is childhood female friend Michelle, tenderly played by the breakthrough-verging Abbie Cornish. Tatum portrays Sgt. Steve Shriver, King's best friend and soldier peer. Shriver is willing to reenlist to serve once more even though he has not completed his 'tour of boyfriend duty' to his impatient girlfriend, the aforementioned 'She is Michelle'. The steady Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the third soldier hometown amigo Tommy Burgess who goes AWOL on his own mental state and not to mention liver by taking aim at the liquor lifestyle. I do commend Peirce for her magnificent cerebral architecture of the mental battle of the postwar American soldier. Even though I do feel that scriber Mike Richard's formulaic screenplay needed some more ingenious verbal-creative firepower. Phillippe's vastly improving acting continued to step up the thespian hierarchy with his commanding performance as Sgt. King. Tatum also followed his acting orders to the 'tee' with his striking work as Shriver, and Gordon-Levitt continues to be one of Hollywood's bright young stars with another superb performance. And Dear Abbie Cornish: Simply keep doing what you are doing. I was also surprisingly flabbergasted with Victor Rasuk's sensitive performance as the war-afflicted handicapped Pvt. Rico Rodriguez. Cinematographer Chris Menges was a man at war with his gripping imminent camera-work. 'Stop-Loss' was not a masterful major cinematic winner but definitely not in the war loss film category. **** Good",8,0,0,30 July 2009
United 93," Stay United by viewing 'United 93'
","September 11, 2001 is still in us. It was a calamity that directly impacted many and indirectly impacted all. After observing these repulsive terrorist acts, many of us were quietly uttering the words 'This is just like a movie'. After you see the shattering gripping film 'United 93' , you will be quietly uttering the words 'This is just like September 11'. Director Paul Greengrass has created a masterpiece of a narrative. The film is based on the hijacked 9-11 United Airlines Flight 93 which was hijacked by terrorists and supposedly was going to strike The White House. However, valiant passengers bombarded the terrorists to prevent The White House strike and instead the plane crashed in a grassy field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The passengers of United 93 woke up on September 11, 2001 as everyday living common people and died that day as forever-to-the-day living-in-our-hearts uncommon heroes. Greengrass powerful directorial execution inserts the viewers as they were actually passengers in United 93 observing the horror objectively, and as if they were air traffic controllers in the stressful trenches of the National Air Traffic Control Centers observing the horror subjectively. The shaky camera style of 'United 93' provides an unsettling hysterical perspective to the film which coincides with the emotions all Americans were feeling on that haunting day. Greengrass' not so 'plane' delivery of 'United 93' was instrumental in disclosing emotions of that infamous day which many of us had stored as secondary sentiments for a couple of years. Greengrass brilliantly interchanges scenes from the turmoil of the flight to the labor of the traffic control centers. He was also wise to cast unknown actors in a film that the characters should supersede the actors portraying them. However, I should point out that the ensemble acting of 'United 93' was remarkable and their performances should take off their thespian careers 'sky high'. 'United 93' is a film that is not exploiting September 11. It is an educational film that pays tribute to the crew of United 93. So unite your family & friends and 'secure' yourself to your local 'homeland' movie theater by embroiling in the cinematic excellence of the film 'United 93'. ***** Excellent",10,9,18,1 May 2006

Finding Neverland," Magical Barrie Tale
","'Finding Neverland' is not based on my relentless pursuit to visit The Playboy Mansion. It is also not based on my own dreams to seize supreme pun powers in a literary fantasy-land called 'Cleverland'. Anyway, 'Finding Neverland' is Director Marc Forster's enchanting narrative on the inspiration behind 'Peter Pan'. Obviously, the centerpiece of the story is J.M. Barrie, the Scottish author of 'Peter Pan'. This fervent jewel of a film focuses on Barrie's friendship & kinship with four fatherless Scottish juvenile lads and their moribund mother. I really dipped into Depp's subdued, but yet, goodwill performance. By previously taking on a swashbuckler role in 'Pirates of the Caribbean' and now an author who inspired a fairytale which a swashbuckler is the villain, one can state that Depp is hooked on the spearing seaman thing. I guess a 'pirate's life for him'. Kate Winslet scores high with yet another winning performance as the courageous mother, Sylvia Davies. Freddie Highmore also sparkles as Peter, the young Davies boy which becomes the primary emphasis of Barrie's inspiration. Because of his stellar work, Highmore should rank 'high' in the child actor department by receiving 'more & more' lucrative acting gigs. Hollywood, Are you ready for Freddie? Dustin Hoffman (playing Theatre Director Charles Frohman) and Julie Christie (playing the controlling grandmother Emma Du Maurier) contribute their well-respected expertise to their roles. But the hero of this tale is not Johnny Depp, nor Peter Pan, nor J.M. Barrie, and not even Wendy. It was Director Marc Forster's illuminating vision of Barrie's experiences with the Davies. With 'Monster's Ball' and now 'Neverland', Forster proves that he is a Director 'forceter' to be reckon with. Screenwriter David Magee developed a tender dialogue that will cause viewers to be 'finding handkerchiefs'. So straighten up and fly right and visit 'Finding Neverland'. **** Good",8,0,0,22 December 2004
Training Day," Surprisingly A Fine Tuned Training!
","November 12, 2001 was the day I saw the intensity-filled `Training Day'. Here is how my `Training Day' went:3:30 p.m.- Since it was `Veterans Day' I knew I had some free time to see a matinee. Usually I see romantic-comedies during matinees, so I had not been trained in the action genre that is `Training Day' during this mid-time of the day.4: 13 p.m.- I decided on `Training Day' because of the buzz on Denzel Washington's virtuosos performance as a crooked L.A. cop. So I got up my gear (my movie watcher discount card, my popcorn money, and my glasses) and was ready to be trained. 4: 45 p.m.- My training began a little rough when I saw the long line outside the movie theatre waiting to get their tickets. I knew now I was not in this alone. 5: 13 p.m.- I now started my neck-stretching warm-up exercise regime as I notice that the only vacant seats left in the cinema room were the ones in the front row. 5:45 p.m.- My official training started in the `advertising department' when I saw the trailers of some upcoming yet-to-be-released films.6: 00 p.m.- 7:00 p.m.- During this time, my training moved into the `public relations department' when I was able to notice that the film was very intense and very well-crafted. It had substance that the viewing public, especially those that live in the inner city, could relate to.7:01 p.m.- 8: 15 p.m.- My training ended in the ` motion picture elite department'. Because after watching this immensely entertaining intelligent film, I knew that it belonged in the elite films of 2001. Academy voters should be put on probation if they do not nominate Denzel for a Best Actor Oscar. Ethan Hawke, who plays the rookie cop who gets manipulated by Denzel's character, was surprisingly good in this type of film for him. However, it was Antonio Fuqua's manipulative direction that was one of the most unpredictable aspects of the film.  8:30 p.m.- My `training day' had ended! So now all of you have been hired to start your 'Training Day' as soon as possible!***** Excellent",9,2,13,21 November 2001
Detroit," As gripping as they come!
","The super cinematic duo of Director Kathryn Bigelow and Writer Mark Boal have constructed an impactful, passionate project in the film 'Detroit'. Rev up your Detroit Pistons, because this one is riveting. It is based on the true story of the 1967 Detroit riots centered on the police brutality travesty that happened in the city's Algiers Motel. Bigelow helms the movie in a masterful manner that magnetizes the viewer into the action, especially in the film's brawny second act. Boal scribes up a script as sturdy as a Detroit Tiger. The film's acting ensemble assembled roaring performances as loud as a Detroit Lion; including John Boyega, Algee Smith, Jacob Latimore, Jason Mitchell, Jack Reynor, Ben O'Toole, Anthony Mackie, Hannah Murray, and Kaitlyn Dever. But it was Will Poulter as the savage, racist cop Krauss that was the standout here and should be 'red winging' it to a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. 'Detroit' is one of the best films of 2017, and should be seen as soon as possible in your motown. ***** Excellent",10,12,29,6 August 2017
In Bruges," Loved it 'In Bruges'
","When I had my cinematic travel experience in 'In Bruges', it was a sheer entertainment extravaganza. Writer-Director Martin McDonagh's 'In Bruges' creation was a juicy blood-broiled black comedic offering, with a few Irish fried hit men to go along with it. Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson star as Ray and Ken, the aforementioned hit men protagonists who are ordered by their mob boss Harry to lay low in Bruges, Belgium due to the fact that Ray accidentally killed a young boy on a hit job. Ken takes a touristy liking to Bruges, while Ken thinks that Bruges is the boredom capital of the world. Their hit men chemistry was definitely on target, and in equilibrant comparison to Jules & Vincent in the classic 'Pulp Fiction'; and this is a fact! Team Kenray do come across some eccentric characters while in Bruges including a: a foul-mouthed dwarf actor, a one-eyed robber, and a rude Canadian couple. A ray of sunshine appears in Ray's torturous Bruges experience when he meets the beautiful ecstasy drug dealer Chloe. Things get a bit hairy for Ray & Ken when Harry comes to Bruges to hunt them down for hit men insubordination; if such thing exists. Colin Farrell was phenomenal as Ray with his witty banter on his hatred for Bruges. Farrell also did the best heavy emotional work in his career portraying Ray as a guilt-ridden suicidal hit-man, while still maintaining his sarcastic comedic liveliness. Gleeson's subdued but resounding performance was also a sure shot winner. Ralph Fiennes continues to be one of the finest actors in the business with his hair-raising thespian fineness as the menacing Harry. I also gladly in took the 'In Bruges' supporting acting experience with crafty performances by Jordan Prentice as the American dwarf actor Jimmy and Clemency Posey as the poised Chloe. Obviously, the city of Bruges does play an integral part of the film's symbolization. I dunno where McDonagh's imaginative genial inspiration came from for his 'In Bruges' masterpiece direction & script; but I bet this is a McDonagh that has more tasty offerings for us to cinematically chew on for some time to come. Must also fare well to Carter Burwell's soothing 'In Bruges' score; might just get the top score as the best movie score of the year in my book. So colonize yourself to Colin's colossal acting and the rest of the outstanding movie attractions that 'In Bruges' has to offer. ***** Excellent",10,3,7,13 February 2009
John Wick," Wooooow!!!! To quote Gomer Pyle: Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!
","Wickedly action-pack entertainment is what 'John Wick' brings! The movie instantly wicky wakey'd me up with its no-holds barred bravado tone. Kudos to Director Chad Stahelski for his masterful action orchestration of the picture. 'John Wick' stars a sensational Keanu Reeves (yes, you heard right!) as the title character. Wick is a former Russian mafia hit-man who seeks all-out vengeance on his former boss' son for stealing his car and killing his puppy beagle. Hey, I am a beagle owner myself, so I can empathize with Wick, I would go bezerk if someone hurt my beagle. Wick is pretty much a badass one-man army in seeking his revenge as he battles an entire Russian Mafia Army! Sure, it goes over-the-top at times, but who cares? The action sequences is the paramount of the picture. Keanu Reeves has never been better, I don't know what kind of red or blue acting pills he took to prepare for this, but it worked. The always great Willem Dafoe also delivers a hit performance as a former accomplice of Wick. And Michael Nyqvist delivers a good performance as the baddie head Russian mafia honcho Viggo Tarasov. So hopefully I have Wicked you up before I go-go, and have convinced you to take a shot at 'John Wick'. ***** Excellent",10,2,7,27 July 2015

Gravity," What's the hyphenated word? FAR-OUT!!!!
","'Gravity' is a visual spectacle of technical brilliance, thanks to the far-out vision of Director Alfonso Cuaron. The film stars Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone, an engineer who is on a space mission to work on a satellite for her research. Along for the el espacio ride is George Clooney as astronaut Matt Kowalksi. When debris from a Russian satellite crashes into their own satellite, they decide to call Direct TV for technical assistance. Wait, come back! I am un tremendo sa-te-li-te so you have to excuse me. Anyways, in reality what happens is that Dr. Stone and Astronaut Kowalski get caught up in a spacely catastrophic situation, and a plight to survive. Cuaron's direction is the gravitational force that magnetizes the viewer into his visually- brilliant 'Gravity'. Cuaron is earthbound to receive lots of love during the movie award season. Bullock's mission of portraying an authentic character of a woman's fight to survive in space was superbly controlled by Madame Sandra. Clooney was pretty much playing the charismatic Clooney in space, but it did have enough pull to give his supporting performance worthy accolades. Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is a sight-to-see and is a shoe-in for a Best Cinematography Oscar. 'Gravity' deserves many stars in its review.

Lone Survivor," Signed, Sealed, and Delivered!
","The gripping 'Lone Survivor' has that 'eye of the tiger' as a surreal cinematic experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This adapted true story stars Mark Wahlberg as Navy Seal Marcus Luttrell who is sent on a mission with his three Seal compadres to kill or capture Tabilan leader Ahmad Shad. When the mission turns into a nightmarish experience, Marcus and company have to fight for their lives by combating a full army of Tabilans. Director Peter Berg, who has not been much of a Berger Directorial King in his past work, does surprise here by brilliantly capturing the authenticity of the misery of war through Marcus' & Co. unforgettable experience. Wahlberg was on target as Marcus, and Ben Foster also fostered in nicely with his work as Navy Seal Matt 'Axe' Axelson. There are many scenes that are a bit too heavy-handed for some viewers, but 'Lone Survivor' is a must-see and a true valiant lesson of overcoming insurmountable odds. And I don't think I am the lone critic (or pseudo-critic better stated) that has the same sentiment. **** Excellent",9,0,1,25 October 2014

Meet the Parents," Familiarize Yourself With Laughs!
","It seems that all of America has gone to see `Meet The Parents.' I do have to admit that it did take me awhile to `Meet The Parents.' Which explains why I always tend to break the romantic law once I meet some potential in-laws. But that is another story. I just recently saw `Meet The Parents' and did think it was a funny film, but not as funny as I though it was going to be. That was probably because of the hoopla. I guess I should have familiarized myself with `Meet The Parents' when it first came out in the theatre. But that is what happens for being a lazy `focker.' Oh `god!' I just thought Robert Deniro was so funny as the overprotective `father', and there is something about Ben Stiller that is making him the acting king of the bad luck characters in cinema today. By the way- even though most of you know, this film is about the hilarious bad luck situations that happen to Stiller's character when he stays in at his girlfriend's parents house for the first time.

I'm Not There," I'm Not There with this one!
","Call me 'The Anti-Dylan', say that I don't give a 'folk' about folk music, even say that I'm not there with the societal implications of storytelling in that type of genre music. However, do not say that I do not have justification in finding the Bob Dylan semi-autobiographical film 'I'm Not There' an exercise in extreme ridiculousness. Director Todd Haynes presents ruminations on the life of Bob Dylan through different eccentric characters: a rambling interviewee Arthur Rimbaud (Ben Winshaw), a hardcore folkie musician Jack Rollins (Christian Bale), a man of the small village wild Billy The Kid (Richard Gere), a gabby black child Woody Guthrie (Marcus Carol Franklin), a successful actor-musician Robbie Clark (Heath Ledger), and a vociferous 'play by my own rules' musician Jude Quinn (Cate Blanchett). Haynes presents us mosaics of their lives and asks us via cinema to compare it to Dylan's musical and personal background. Note to Haynes: Not everybody is an obsessed Dylan film like you Todd! Maybe Dylan has his 'Haynes' on or visa-versa, but I do not partake in the 'underwear' I mean underbelly of that musical environment. The performances from the actors were decent Dylan subliminal portrayals but without a doubt the one that will cross your mind a few times was the phenomenal performance of Cate Blanchett as Quinn. Yes, you got it! To quote the great Austin Powers: 'That isn't no woman, it's a man, baby!' or maybe it was the other way around. Nevertheless, Blanchett was worthy of her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination and several other critical accolades that she received for her work here; Simply stated: She was the Mighty Quinn. Too bad Todd Haynes writing and direction of 'I'm Not There' was simply not there! Even though I loved Cate here, my advice to you is to not be there for 'I'm Not There'. ** Needs Improvement",5,4,7,30 May 2008
Unbreakable," Unforgettable!
","Unbreakable that's what you are (Director M. Night Shyamalan new film) Unbreakable now playing at a theatre near you some near some far (it is worth the ticket price.) Oh my god! Why am I writing this review about the new film from  the director of The Sixth Sense with Nat King Cole in my system? Is it that I am going crazy or maybe I am seeing dead singers? Back to reality: The film is about a security guard who comes out unscratched from a serious train wreck. He then meets a very strange character in order to obtain the answers from this mysterious happening. Stars Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson deliver notable performances, and once again demonstrate that it is no pulp fiction that they work well together with a vengeance. The only aspect that I would put some krazy glue on to `Unbreakable' was the role of Robin Wright Penn in the film. Her role was written a little bit too underdeveloped. Director Shyamalan strength is the surprise endings he inserts in his films, and you should sense that it is no different with `Unbreakable.' Come and break the ice!

Star Trek," A far out disaster!
","Call me a strange earthling who does not venture into the popular planet of Trekkies, but I still don't get the fascination of the 'Star Trek' phenomenon. And Director J.J. Abrams' 'Star Trek' flick for the present generation did not generate interest for me to get on trek to Trekkieland. In fact, I found the latest 'Star Trek' movie adaptation so repulsive and ridiculous, that I have been promoted to Vice President of the UFO (Untrekkie Fascist Organization). Abrams attempted to go where man has gone before way too many times, tell a tale of the origin of popular TV characters of an infamous TV show. So yes, we do discover how Captain Kirk became the entrepreneur king of the USS Enterprise; how Spock was all ears on seeking vengeance for the destruction of his planet Vulcan; and who were Kirk and Spock's parents, and how they played a part in their Enterprise Rent-A-Ship senior citizens program. OK, disregard the last one; I was pun-spaced out! We even have a Leonard Nimoy sighting in this latest 'Star Trek' as an older version of Spock who actually somewhere in the film confronts the young version of Spock. Nimoy's 'In Search Of¬ÖToo Many Spocks' was featured oddly there. The rest of the Enterprise gang joins in for this film version also: Dr. Bones McCoy, Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott, Sulu, and Uhura. None of them are engaging or charismatic, but if I had to beam up a winner, I would select Scotty; who was pegged in nicely by comedic British actor Simon Pegg's commendable performance. The rest of the thespian enterprise of 'Star Trek' was a disaster including Chris Pine as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, Eric Bana as the baddie Nero, Zoe Saldana as Uhura, and John Cho as Sulu. And even though Abrams was able to Finding Nimoy, old Leonard did not bring much to the older Spock characterization. Robert Orci & Alex Kurtzman's script of 'Star Trek' did not live long and prosperous in my attention span, too impractical and disengaging. Listen, I do not blame J.J. Abrams for his effort in piloting 'Star Trek' for the present generation; but it looked like J.J. was lost in storytelling on presenting the film's narrative through a director's vision. I please want J.J. to give me back the two hours I lost in watching 'Star Trek' but I know that is a mission that is impossible. Join the federation of Untrekkies and move into another cinematic galaxy devoid of 'Star Trek'. * Failure",3,5,11,11 April 2010
Fury," Only Frank the Tank has more action antics than this!!!
","I feel that Writer-Director David Ayer's World War II film 'Fury' got massacred with many unfair negative reviews. Sure, it might have been 20 minutes too long (so it wasn't too fast but it was furious), sure it mimicked 'Saving Private Ryan' mucho with its many narrative missiles (whatever that means?), but I sure did enjoy it anyway. 'Fury' stars Brad Pitt as Sgt. Don 'Wardaddy' Collier who commands a Sherman tank Fury and its five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Ayer based the film on real life war incidents told by former War veterans who manned Army tanks in World War II. It just seemed like yesterday or better said 'ayer' when Ayer wrote the 'Training Day' screenplay, and after a few solid directorial action-movie efforts including 'End of Watch', one could say Ayer is a director for today's action movies, not yesterday's; you got all that. The cast of 'Fury' was the bomb! That basterd Brad Pitt was on target as a Nazi Killer again as Wardaddy. Shia LaBeouf can still act, besides his real life garbage-head shenanigans, he was sound here as the preaching tank Private Boyd 'Bible' Swan. Lorgan Lerman was a perk in the movie as the scared rookie Private Norman Ellison. Jon Bernthal was no 'walking dead' tank Private as the aggressive Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis. And to round out the Tankers, Michael Pena was not as good as the rest but still did not misfire as tank sharpshooter Private Trini 'Gordo' Garcia. Maybe the jury is still out on 'Fury' and still has to pass the test of time, but I still think that this movie did not tank in my round of cinematic machinery. *****Excellent",9,9,16,9 July 2015
Fight Club," Split Decision
","'Fight Club' is a type of film that will not totally knock you out with excitement, but it does go the distance thanks to some of its complex twists and turns. The movie is billed as Brad Pitt as its star. However, it is really the Edward Norton character which this film revolves around. To bill Pitt as the main actor, was a bit displeasing and just plain pitiful. This experimental story is about an underground fight club started by the Norton and Pitt characters. What I thought was worth fighting for was to have more of Norton and co-star Helena Bonham Carter dual scenes. Their chemistry was a unanimous winning duo! We just did not get enough of it. Also, I felt like throwing the towel a few times when I saw a bit too many long scenes that were not instrumental to the film's following striking developments. Finally, if you do go see 'Fight Club' make sure you follow these two rules- 1) You do not tell anyone the ending of 'Fight Club' 2) You do not tell anyone the ending of 'Fight Club.' *** Average",7,1,3,6 June 2000
Monster," Monster Film!
","Come on Aileen! Why did you have to turn to a life of prostitution, which made you a habitual street midnight runner? Why did you not face your demons and get psychological help? And of course, why did you go on that killing spree? These monstrous questions are answered in the biographical film `Monster'. Monster is of course on the life of Aileen Wuornos. She was labeled by the media as the first American female serial killer. Wournos, a prostitute, killed 7 of her johns during the late 80's and early 90's in order to support her lesbian lover. Charlize Theron plays Wuornos in what has been described as one of the best transformation acting performances in cinematic history. Miss Theron, who gained 30 pounds for the role & had a wickedly scary Wuornos makeup alteration, is no Charlize Angel in this picture. Her mannerisms & gestures ,which copied those of the mentally disturbed Wuornos, were done with pitch-perfect accuracy. I mean that serialously, i mean seriously. Christina Ricci also executes an astounding performance as Wuornos' teenage lesbian lover. Monster's screenplay was also a monster ingredient in the film's success. There is dialogue in this film that is unforgettable and will be fixated in your cerebral cortex for days. First-time Writer/Director Patty Jenkins is deserving of newcomer accolades in a film that was challenging to direct and probably was not some type of pattycake project. But it is Charlize Theron who steals the show with her killer performance. Can you say Best Actress Oscar recipient? Do not be afraid of this monster and check out `Monster'. ***** Excellent",9,0,0,29 January 2004
Memento," Mementous Film!
","The memento has come for me to tell you that you will not see a more original film this year than  `Memento.' The film is about an insurance agent who is on a vengeance mission to find out who raped and killed his wife. However, this is definitely a challenge for him because he has short term memory loss from the time that his wife was murdered. This means he only remembers real life experiences right after they happen for only about 5 minutes (which is very similar to my situation when I go out drinking). He experienced this trauma because of a head injury he suffered when he was trying to save his wife from the killer. Star Guy Pearce delivers an unforgettable performance that academy award voters should not forget during oscar time. The remarkable thing about this film is that is presented backwards. We see the action-packed conclusion at the beginning of the film, and the beginning of the story at the end (which is very similar to how I always hope my dating nights would turn out to be like). Anyway, this makes us be in the same predicament as the main character because of his condition. Whatever you do, don't forget to see `Memento.' ***** Excellent",10,0,1,16 April 2001
Inglourious Basterds," The inglorious glory of Tarantino reigns!
","Ingloury, Ingloury alleluyah, Tarantino has laid it down! The Q is back in Director monarchy status with his rocking orchestration of 'Inglourious Basterds'. The I.B.'s (see film title) are a renegade squad of Jewish-Americans with a German Nazi killer who go on a mission in Nazi occupied France to hunt down and dismember the Nazialites during World War II. The Basterds are led by redneck Lt. Aldo Raine, a scowl-gestured feisty leader who is one damn funny basterd, and has a zero-tolerance sympathy for the germy Nazi Germans. Brad Pitt's brilliant performance as Raine was a shower of comic delight. The rest of the Basterds include: Sgt. Donny Donowitz, a baseball bat basher who hits Nazi brains out of the war park; Pfc. Omar Ulmer, a Nazi brain dismembering specialist who definitely makes the Basterd cut right; Private Smithson Utivich, the quiet Basterd who Nazis nickname 'The Little Man' without him knowing; Lt. Archie Hicox, the undercover Basterd who needed to take some foreign accentuation classes before his spy gigs; and last but not least, the German beast Sgt. Hugo Stiglitz, a bulky German who is famed for brutally murdering Nazis and therefore ends up a Basterd. The beastly basterd supporting thespian work of Eli Roth as Donowitz, Omar Doom as Ulmer, B.J. Novak as Utivich, Michael Fassbender as Hicox, and Til Schweiger as Stiglitz was Basterd grunt euphoria! Not since the 'Saving Private Ryan' grunts have I witnessed some fine acting in a movie war squad! OK Meeza, at ease! Now let's move to the dark side, the Nazis. Christoph Waltz plays the verbally manipulative Nazi Colonel Hans Landa, his specialty is to find hiding Jews in all of France at all costs. Hans is the premier villain of the film, yes even above Der Fuehrer himself. I have not witnessed such a despicable, but yet quite charming, villain in a film since I witnessed another Hans twenty years ago that being Hans Gruber in 'Die Hard'. Waltz' virtuoso performance will waltz him into the Oscar dance with a Best Supporting Actor nomination, and even a win. Some commanding Nazi supporting acting turns were also executed by Daniel Bruhl as Private Fredrick Zoller, a Nazi war hero who stars in a movie based on his sniper work in killing thousands of Jews; and August Diehl who plays Dieter Hellstrom, a supercilious German Major who grows suspicious of Hicox's fake German accent and partakes with some of the Basterd undercovers in a drunken game at a basement tavern. Hell, even Martin Wuttke was not bad playing Hitler himself; that is the only time you will see 'not bad' and 'Hitler' in the same sentence. And what about the chicks? Shosanna Dreyfus might be just considered the central character of the film. Dreyfus is a France theatre owner who lost her entire family during one of Landa's Jew seeking expeditions a few years ago. With inglorious intervention a few years later, she is confronted with devilish Hans again when he is self-assigned the role of Security Head for the premiere of Zoller's sniper film at Dreyfus' theatre. Consequently, Shosanna comes up with a fiery plan to eradicate all Nazi officers attending the premiere in her theatre. Melanie Laurent's work as Dreyfus was of Best Saint Laurent scent. Another delightful fem performance was delivered by Diane Kruger playing famed German actress Bridget Von Hammersmark, who is also set her mark in rightfully betraying her country by hammering some Nazis, and even congregates with the heroic I.B.'s to eradicate the Nazis at the film premiere in Shosanna's theatre. Yes, there is a myriad of plot developments within the movie, but Quentin would not have it any other way. Tarantino's screenplay was masterful as the dialogue itself within the characters symbolized the red flags of bloody red violence lurking thereafter. No one develops this form of verbal antecedent better than Tarantino, as he has also formulated it proficiently in his past films. It has become the Q's original writer-director niche. Quentin most certainly deserves Best Director & Best Screenplay Oscar nominations for his stellar film-making of 'Inglourious Basterds'. The Academy would be the new Inglorious Bastards if they fire him with snubs. Tarantino's glorious film-making team also made their mark! Robert Richardson's cinematography & Sebastian Krawinkel's art direction were cine veritas on the authenticity of Nazi-occupied France. As in most of Quentin's films, the music & the score played integral parts in 'Inglourious Basterds' developments, and the hip glorious tunes tuned us all attentively. OK, I know I have been a critical basterd by elongating this film review! But I just wanted to provide you a cut-by-cut analysis on the masterpiece entitled 'Inglourious Basterds'. ***** Excellent",10,2,10,13 September 2009
This Is the End," Apocalypse Comedy Now!!!
","I am going to begin my review of 'This is the End' by stating that this comedy is one tour-de-force zany trip. Does it make it an infinite comedic classic? Probably not, but its still worth the ride. The writer- director team of Seth Rogen & Evan Goldberg do helm this one as an outlandish mock festival with a fair amount of laughs. Numerous comedic actors play themselves including James Franco, Jonah Hill, Danny McBride, Jay Baruchel, Craig Robinson, and Rogen himself. The premise is that they are at a party at Franco's mansion and in less than 127 minutes, an apocalyptic catastrophe wreaks havoc and puts all the actors in a tailspin survival crisis situation. There is plenty of mocking around here, as they all play presumed versions of themselves. There are a plethora of 'over the top' scenes in the flick, especially with McBride & Hill; but in the end, it's all part of the territory. I really cannot acknowledge any acting performance here because they have all that Memorex (is it real or is it¬Ö) tone to them. To end my review, I still do recommend you to take the backstreets or the main road, and give 'This is the End' a try; but it will not be the end of the world if you miss it either. **** Good",8,2,6,5 January 2014
Iron Man 2," Isn't it Ironic? I don't think
","There are plenty of rough spots to iron out in 'Iron Man 2'. I did not feel the super charismatic powers in this one as I did in the original. Not to say that the sequel was a total disaster, but there were some narrative elements that Director Jon Favreau and especially actor-turned-screenwriter Justin Theroux should have unwrinkled in this mediocre sequel. In this ironic chapter, Tony Stark (of course Iron Man himself) becomes a narcissist iron-tuned man machine in arrogantly telling the world that his iron weaponry is the country's main armed defense and they are helpless without him. Starks then faces new super challenges in being a identity-revealed super hero: competitive corporations try to develop their own ironisque design suits, his mechanical heart is causing his blood toxic level to rise, he faces pressure from a jealous U.S. Senator, is obsessed in pursuing his deceased father's vision to become a reality, and delegates his CEO executive powers of Starks Enterprises to his right-hand woman Pepper Potts. Of course, Iron Man does encounter new enemies. Those would come in the form of an avenging Russian named Ivan Vanco, who has constructed a miniaturized arc reactor of his own including whip-like attachments harnessing the electrical energy. And also the garrulous & obnoxious Justin Hammer, a CEO corporate rival who desperately tries to hammer out a super iron suit of his own to no avail. Starks' BFF Lt. Colonel James Rhodes does return in this installment in taking the high road on becoming an armed super hero of his own, in order to help Iron Man not to dive into a colossal downfall. We also get some spy eye-candy in this one with the gorgeous Natalie Rushman, Starks new assistant who may or may not be the Rush woman she claims to be; and there just might be another limelight to her persona. Robert Downey Jr. was again stellar as Starks/Iron Man, so I am down with him still playing the armed superhero. Gwyneth Paltrow as Potts lost some of that Potts' thespian high that she embodied in the first installment. Mickey Rourke did kind of wrestle with his underdeveloped role as Vanco. The undervalued Sam Rockwell did rock once more in the acting arena with his performance as the determined Hammer. I felt kind of cheated with Don Cheadle's flat work as Rhodes; Terrence Howard was more divine in the Rhodes role in the predecessor. I was elated that there was a casting trip to Johannsonburg by having the stunning Scarlett Johansson portray Natalie Rushman/Black Widow. I do credit Favreau for enterprising some challenging direction to 'Iron Man 2', but this 'just in', Justin Theroux's immensely chatty screenplay was too much talk and not enough creative bite. There were way too many mumbling elongated conversations in 'Iron Man 2' which provided a mechanical restlessness in its viewing audience. So I am bit in the red with 'Iron Man 2' but I am still down with Downey. *** Average",7,1,2,9 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," We Are Marshall and We Rock!
","We guys have all had some Sarah Marshalls during our lifetime- a ridiculously beautiful little blonde bombshell with a perky zest for romance, adventure, and sex. OK, don't we wish! But we guys have also been victims of The Marshall Plan when the Sarah Marshalls of the world have dropped the trouncing breakup bomb on us. The highly entertaining comedy 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' encompasses the bitter tastes of the brutal break-up victimization process with comedic connotations. 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is yet another brainchild of comedy producer mogul Judd Apatow and his riotous entourage. Jason Segel stars as Peter Bretter, a television show score musician who has scored himself with the hottie star of the show Sarah Marshall played by the bellisima Kristen Bell. But bedding Sarah Marshall becomes a past phenomenon for Peter when she breaks up with him. Peter is in the raw when she does the malicious dumperiski act so there is no doubt she lays the naked truth on him. Peter's life becomes a disarrayed existence in coming to grips with the heartbreak. He takes solace in his stepbrother Brian to help him ease the pain but to no avail. After some uncontrollable crying, Peter starts participating in the one-night-stand routines to help him forget Sarah. But Peter is still in the heartbreak dungeon. Eventually, he decides to go on a solo Hawaiian escapade. But faster than you can say 'Aloha', he runs into Sarah and her rock star new boyfriend Aldous Snow portrayed by the unrestricted Russell Brand; Snow is a sex crazed British singing lunatic lothario who has an appetite for all hotties named Sarah (pause)¬Ö. , and Diana, and Jane, and Mary and¬Ö. you get me. Brand has branded his raunchy British comedy to the States with an overwhelming welcome. Back to St. Peter- he encounters numerous outrageous experiences and befriends eccentric characters (besides Snow) during his Hawaiian experience including: Rachel Jensen (Mila Kunis), a cutesy hotel attendant who helps Mr. Peter roll over the breakup hump by devouring him of much pain and even a potentiality for a new romance is invoked. The ensemble acting of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' was a firecracker thespian experience. Besides the stellar performances from Segal, Bell, Kunis, and Brand- we also get some outlandish supporting turns from Paul Rudd as an amnesiac surfer (my personal favorite character of the film), Jonah Hill as an obsessive fan waiter, and the stupendous Bill Hader as the previously mentioned 'Stepbrother of Peter'- Paul; I mean Brian. Director Nicholas Stroller is able to stroll his characters with effective dynamic scenarios and I also quite enjoyed how he incorporates Hawaii as central character to the film's developments. Double kudos goes out to Segal for also scribing the very funny screenplay; and the whole 'Dracula Rock Opera' thang did not suck as some have said. 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is unforgettable, that is what you are! Do not forget it! I sure won't as one my favorite comedies of all time! ***** Excellent",10,1,7,7 September 2009
The Hunger Games," Appetite for destruction depicted in fine form in 'The Hunger Games'
","There is a movie that many moviegoers have had an appetite to chew on, and it's called 'The Hunger Games'. Heard of it? But of course you have, most of America and the world has not only heard of this movie but have already digested 'The Hunger Games' with a cinematic viewing. I did that myself and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Based on Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel, 'The Hunger Games' takes place in the future where the Capitol selects a boy and a girl (called tributes) from twelve districts to fight to the death on live television; hopefully, not the future of reality shows even though some of them have already plagued many with superficiality syndrome. In the competition, there is only one winner and the rest of the twenty-three participants will be fatally eliminated which can make any of the twenty-four participants sick to their stomach in the hunger games competition. The movie stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, she is the arching aficionado who volunteers to enter the hunger games replacing her kid sister Primrose who was primarily selected as the District 12 female tribute. Josh Hutcherson co-stars as Peeta Mellark, the District 12 male tribute representative selected for the hunger games in order for the Capitol to get a taste of that Peeta bred. Director Gary Ross does not dress for less this movie by brilliantly capturing the film's pulsating tone of its Darwinism competition and depicting a future of an oxymoron-like colorful darkness. Collins, Ross, and Billy Ray's screenplay was not a utopia scribe, but it did hit the verbal bulls-eye in numerous scenes. Jennifer Lawrence's starring performance as Katniss was multilayered and magnetic! It was dead on! Maybe wrong choice of words, sorry Katniss! Hutcherson's work as Peeta was mediocre at its best or maybe it was because the Kitty Katniss was more delicious than the Peeta White Bread. Woody Harrelson was hey bitchin' in his supporting work as mentor Haywitch Abernathy, and provided some of the best lines in the movie; so another kudos there for the film's screenplay. Other tasty supporting performances in 'The Hunger Games' include Elizabeth Banks as District 12 spokesperson Effie Trinket, Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games' master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman, Donald Sutherland as Capitol President Snow, and Amandla Stenberg as District 11 child tribute Hue. But it was Lawrence's tour-de-force performance that filled me up the most with thespian pleasure in 'The Hunger Games'. OK, I know you have had enough of my pun tributes to this movie, so I will conclude my review. So in all, I think the odds are in your favor that you will enjoy 'The Hunger Games'. **** Good",8,4,14,1 April 2012
The Impossible," Natural-Disaster Movie Mission Accomplished!
","It is a mission impossible if I don't include puns in my movie reviews. And that is the case also in my review for the tsunami‚Äìthemed film 'The Impossible'. One of the worst global catastrophes happened when I inadvertently put a 'new wave' spin to movie reviews by pestering them with puns. OK, I am kidding, even though some of you might concur with that sentiment. In reality, one of the worst global catastrophes ever was the 2004 Thailand tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people. 'The Impossible' is based on a true story of one family that miraculously survived the Thaliand tsunami disaster. Naomi Watts stars as the mother of the family named Maria; she is a doctor who visits Thailand for a Christmas vacation with her husband Henry and their three sons Lucas, Thomas, and Simon. Maria gets seriously injured in the tsunami and separates from Henry, Thomas, and Simon. Maria does find the eldest son Lucas in the rapid tsunami waters. Therefore, Lucas' mission is to get help for her profoundly injured mother; while Henry, Thomas, and Simon's mission is to find Maria and Lucas. Director Juan Antonio Bayona's impressive reenactment of the Thailand tsunami on film was quite a feat for this aspiring filmmaker. His directorial future is nowhere close to being a disaster. Now, I did have some minor complaints with Sergio Sanchez' screenplay; even though it proficiently verbalized the power of the human spirit, it was lacking a bit of character development, so I was not entirely swept away with Sanchez' scribe. Naomi Watts was outstanding in her Oscar-nominated leading performance as Maria. The underrated Ewan McGregor was also exceptional as Henry. And child actor Tom Holland is headed to Hollandwood, I mean Hollywood child stardom with his stirring performance as Lucas. What I found to be the most disastrous in the aftermath of 'The Impossible' was the disheartening omission of a Best Production Design Oscar nomination for 'The Impossible'; I guess the 'old wave' of geriatric Academy members did not catch the brilliance of Production Designer Eugenio Caballero's work in the movie. I do think 'The Impossible' is an emotionally-charged movie that will make it impossible for you not to shed a watering tear. So make it possible to catch 'The Impossible'. **** Good",8,1,2,24 February 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Dreadful for Man's Head!
","Yuckkkkkkkkkkkkk! Yes, I am going to get it off my live man's chest! 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is as atrocious as they come! To be 'clicheish' - ' I do not know what all the fuss is all about!' Sure it has brought in a buck or two, but I think they are more familial fiscal contributions than 'word of mouth' excitement. The sequel to the pleasurable 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' was a total 'shitwreck'. The film follows our protagonists Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swain battling for their lives with a wicked Octopus disfigured man Davy Jones. Johnny Depp was quite a showstopper in the original Black Pearl, but his pirate show wears thin and is not much of an 'eye-opener' in the sequel. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley should of 'walked the plank' early in the film to spare us of their abysmal performances. Director Gore Verbinski should of bared the name Bore Verbinski in the credits. 'This Pirate's Movie is Not for Me' and is not much of an attraction! * Failure",3,3,5,5 September 2006
Argo," Argo! Go Find Yourself an Oscar! Brilliant movie!
","I promise I will not hold you hostage with a myriad of corny puns in my film review of the exhilarating 'Argo', but then again I am free from pun censorship so just please bear with me. Director Ben Affleck has just catapulted to exemplary filmmaker status with his masterful direction of 'Argo'. The movie is based on a true story during the Iran Hostage Crisis when CIA Agent Tony Mendez masterminded a plan to free six American Hostages held in a Canadian Embassy in Iran by pretending to make a sci-fi movie called 'Argo' in Iran in order to return them to the states. Hollywood came calling in support of Mendez' Argo cinematic plan of action in the form of assistance from Oscar-Winning Makeup Artist Tony Chambers and Hollywood Producer Lester Siegel. Hollywood Awards will also come calling to Affleck for his utopian direction of 'Argo'. How he was able to incorporate an infamous international crisis and the satire of Hollywood movie-making was phenomenal. Affleck was also solid in his starring performance as Mendez. It will not be justifiable if I don't give Chris Terrio some props for his captivating screenplay of the picture. The supporting acting of 'Argo' was also spectacular. I am not making this up when I say that John Goodman deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his charismatic performance as Makeup Artist Chambers. And Alan Arkin's comical scene-stealing work as Producer Siegel should produce yet another Best Supporting Actor nomination to A.A.'s resume. And you can never go wrong with having Bryan Cranston in a movie; Cranston plays Mendez' CIA Boss. The steady Bryan has still not broken in a bad acting performance. Many will argue that 'Argo' played around a bit with the facts of what really happened during that crisis, but one cannot argue that 'Argo' is one of the best movies of the year and is probably headed for Oscar royalty. So that is the end of my review, which means you have been officially rescued from my Argoistic puns! ***** Excellent",10,2,6,3 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Piracy at its best!
","`Yo! Ho! Ho! A pirate's movie is not for me!' I always said every time I watched a torturous pirate film. In fact, the most pleasurable live pirate episodes I have experienced were the ones where some of my compadres seized their mate's stunning girlfriends in several happy hour watering holes. In fact, that can lead to pirate `eye-for-an-eye' warfare where it turns out too difficult for friends to patch things up. Anyway, back to pirate films. I am astonished but glad to report that `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' has broken the curse of horrendous pirate flicks. The film is based on the Disney attraction ride, and the movie does not derail from its voyage of cinematic cleverness. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, a charismatic pirate who is on a quest to regain his old ship `The Black Pearl'. Johnny be very good with his oscar-worthy performance as Sparrow. With this work, Johnny has paid his Depps I mean debts to those critics who have condemned him for not selecting roles in more commercially appealing films. It is one of the best acting pieces of the year! Co-star Orlando Bloom is blooming into a star with his role as the Blacksmith on a quest to rescue the Governor's daughter Elizabeth Swann. Speaking of which, Keira Knightley√Ç‚Äòs breakthrough performance as Elizabeth was also commendable. Geoffrey Rush as the evil pirate continues to demonstrate his scene-stealing ability to portray scoundrel antagonists. Director Gore Verbinski provided just the right touch of Goreism for it to be a Gore candidate as the best film he has directed. `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' is the pirate film for me! So guys take your hoe hoe hoe (sorry ladies) to watch this jewel and you will see that this pirate film is for you too. **** Good",8,0,1,29 December 2003
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Love this non-stupid rom-com! Call me crazy but I do!
","Call me crazy (as many have), call me stupid (see last comment in parentheses), and call me love (as many females that have called me crazy & stupid have), but I think the romantic comedy 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is one of the best romantic comedies of the last few years. Before I continue, I must confess that I am a master of crazy & stupid puns and there will be more coming your way in this review. So let me get to the cool crazy of 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Steve Carell stars as Cal, a dull husband & father who suddenly is dropped the bomb by his wife Emily (Julianne Moore) that she wants a divorce. Cal's streak of hits with his wife comes to an abrupt end and he must cope in living a new single life. There is where the slick Jacob comes in, played by Ryan Gosling. As Cal embarrasses himself profusely in a stylish singles bar by yelling out the name of the man that slept with Emily, lothario Jacob takes notice and takes it upon himself to help stop the Calsanity. So then Jacob befriends Cal and shows him the tricks of the singles trade and the notebook to pick up women, Gosling can't seem to let go of those notebooks. Then we have Hannah & her Sisters, actually just Hannah, played by Emma Stone. She is an aspiring lawyer who is self-confident and initially does not let herself be another Jacob conquest when they first meet. Hannah wishes to be proposed to marriage by Richard, an uninteresting lawyer at the practice where she interns; it is quite evident that the charismatic Hannah is in a higher court than Richard, who is really a dick, by nickname of course (coughing twice). There is a quasi-creepy side plot in the movie of the babysitter of Cal & Emily's kids that I will not provide too much info on because that would be downright stupid to spoil it for you. Co-Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa do incorporate crazy in the movie with a lot of love, but it is hardly ever stupid. So yea, I do commend Team Ficqua for their crafty orchestration of 'Crazy, Stupid, Love' and for not letting it drown to the formulaic pitfalls of most romantic comedies. And it sure looks like Dan Fogelman was the write man to pen up the witty screenplay of the movie. I could not think who else can 'Calify' to play Cal than Steve Carell himself, and he was up to par with a steady performance as Cal. Julianne Moore once again brings more to the table in each role and here is no different with her solid work as Emily. I would have liked to see more of Emma Stone (in more ways than one, call that one under the stupid comment category) but she continues to shine with each thespian assignment; and yes, it is another performance that earns her an Easy A in acting. Gosling was a scene-stealer even though at times I was thinking that he was auditioning for the remake of 'American Gigolo'. There were some fine supporting work also from the underrated John Carroll Lynch as the babysitter's father (sounds like a scary movie), Marisa Tomei as a teacher that becomes a one-night Cal gal, and Kevin Bacon as a colleague of Emily who wants her to eat his bacon to another degree. I did tell you that there were crazy, stupid puns in this review! So stop yelling at me!! Anyways, if you reached to this point of my review, you must be crazy. But please do not be stupid and miss the enjoyable 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. ***** Excellent",Null,2,4,7 August 2011
Green Room," Green is Good! Very Good! In fact, Excellent!
","Maybe the grass is not greener on the other side because the indie thriller 'Green Room' is one of the best movies I will see in 2016. Writer-Director Jeremy Saulnier has delivered with this tense flick about a modern hardcore punk rock band who end up entrapped in a dangerous situation in a neo Nazi skinhead bar. The movie stars the late Anton Yelchin as Pat, the bassist of the band who is trying to string his way out , along with his bandmates, out of the unexpected entrapment ordeal. Imogen Poots co-stars as Amber, a follower of the neo Nazi who ends up being also entrapped with the punk rockers. And I must mention Patrick Stewart, whose deliciously mild-mannered but wicked role as the neo Nazi leader Darcy is magnetically superb and Xcellent I mean excellent; and should garner consideration for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Speaking of Oscar, Saulnier's enigmatic direction and stellar script of 'Green Room' is worthy of that 'Gold Room' list of nominations. Yelchin was outstanding as Pat, and as excellent as it was it was also heartbreaking to see due to his unexpected passing. Poots was a hoot as the witty Amber. I also liked many other supporting performances from the film. The 'Green Room' acting ensemble needs to get the green light for acting ensemble nominations come awards season. So go green and sneak inside the 'Green Room'. ***** Excellent",10,3,6,4 September 2016

Because it's going to come in handy when you watch the romantic tearjerker 'The Notebook'. So are you ready to take notes? Here we go: 'The Notebook' is the poster film of chic flicks for 2004. Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel Mcadams as Allie star as young lovers who must overcome obstacles to survive their romance: poor boy/rich girl dilemma, boy has cool dad and girl has overprotective mom, boy goes to war/girl goes to pray. Yea, we have seen these formulaic concepts before, but take note of this, they are presented by Director Nick Cassavetes as more of an instrumental plight then a serendipity fluffy ingredient. The story is told by older Noah to the older Allie, who suffers from a degenerate Alzheimer's condition, in hopes of getting her to remember their unforgettable love. That's it, reach for that handkerchief. James Garner did garner a S.A.G. Best Supporting Actor nom for his heartwarming performance as the older Noah. Gena Rowlands as the older Allie was no match for Garner but it was sporadically tender. However, she crawled up the wrong allie when it came to match Garner's magnanimity. Cassavates, who is Rowland's real life son, did execute a credible job with the festooning and amour of 'The Notebook'. Several scenes were of cinematography perfection by Robert Fraisse. His 'Fraisse' frames were breathtaking. However, what binded me the most of 'The Notebook' was the emotional breakthrough performance of Rachel Mcadams. I wonder if there is more talent in 'The Mcadams Family'. OK guys! Final Notes! If you request a movie to get your gals all romantic & horny then 'The Notebook' gets straight lays, I mean straight A's, in that department. **** Good",8,0,0,25 April 2005
The Rocker," The Rocker is a comedic charttopper!
","Some critics have called the latest 'rock-n-roll world' lampoon flick 'The Rocker' an incomparable imitation of the critical darling of the same theme 'School of Rock'. To drum it up in simplistic syntax, both films ROCKED!!!!! 'The Rocker' is not a carbon copy narrative of 'School of Rock'; it does have a musical story life of its own. 'The Rocker' stars the zany Rainn Wilson as Robert 'Fish' Fishman, an over-the-top boisterous drummer. Fish was about to dive into the school of 'Rock-Roll Fame & Fortune' when he was the drummer of an 80's heavy metal band called Vesufius. Just before Vesufius made it to stardom, Fish got the firing bait when the band's agent persuaded the Vesufius band members to let the Fish go so he can be replaced with a recording studio hotshot's son. Therefore, Fish was a musician out of the musical waters for the next twenty years. That is until Fish's nephew Matt asked Fish to be the drummer of his high school band entitled A.D.D. (are you with me?, lol) because the original juvenile drummer boy was being a bad boy and got expelled. Fish accepts and the rocker show begins! Fish is one to rebel and follow the beat of his own ludicrous drum and therefore A.D.D. chaos follows. Due to parental control issues of the remaining A.D.D. band members, the band is forced to rehearse each from their own home utilizing technical wizardry so they can view each other. Fish chooses to rehearse in the nude and before you can say 'a little bored girl put it on You Tube and got zillions of hits' it did that exact same thing. That undoubtedly is the scary 'naked truth' on the Fish following. Consequentially, fame and fortune follow for A.D.D. as they land a recording contract and tour gigs all over the country. Rainn Wilson's breakthrough performance as Fish was a comedic vivacious delight that should rain him in some more starring comedic roles. I also loved Jeff Garlin's role as the rocker-fantasy suburban dad. Screenwriters Maya Forbes & Wallace Wolodarsky scripted a trendy and modern narrative that symbolized the present youth obsessions & dilemmas in combination with the 80's retro fixations of the forty-year old generation. It was also quite damn hilarious for those young and older. And Director Peter Cattaneo brought the script to cinematic life by orchestrating a fine-tuned comedic machine. 'The Rocker' might not be nominated for any Oscars, Golden Globes, or even Grammys, but it's a flick that simply (well you know¬Ö) ROCKS in the comedic entertainment 'hysterically laugh out-loud' record category. ***** Excellent",9,39,68,25 August 2008
Public Enemies," My public record shows that 'Public Enemies' is a cinematic hit!
","John Dillinger was a gangster legend who was adored, loathed, chased, admired, and detested by many. There are mixed elements to how people judged John Dillinger, and that was one the most admirable & authentic qualities to Director Michael Mann's John Dillinger gangster flick 'Public Enemies'. Mann wisely does not evolve into the entire biography of the Dillinger tale; there is no childhood chronology and no catastrophic life scarring moment. It is basically about a man choosing a life of crime in order to live fast and play hard, subconsciously aware to the fact that is will be not be infinite. Mann starts the film with Dillinger already at his height of his gangster popularity orchestrating another one of his 'great escape from prison' schemes. Then once again, Johnny D. and his bad boy entourage are robbing banks and living the retro thug life. Dillinger then checks out and romances the lovely checkout coat girl Billie Frechette. Apparently, Johnny's fresh ways were successful in luring Ms. Freshette. During that era of the 1930's crime hike, many Americans were rooting for these public enemies to rob banks in order to show their dislike of American banks for their mismanagement which eventually was the catastrophic factor which caused The Great Depression. Not to undermine the fact that many were against the dreadfulness that Dillinger and his men caused by their heinous crimes. J. Edgar Hoover was during that time trying to formalize his Bureau of Investigation into a national police force which later became known as the FBI. But Hoover had to find ways to vacuum the U.S. Government into this political formalization. Therefore, he exploited the capture of outlaws as a way to elevate his Bureau of Investigations. He then delegated the task of capturing Public Enemy Number 1, Dillinger himself, to top agent Melvin Purvis. The central plot line shootout of 'Public Enemies' which Mann exhibits is the relentless pursuit of Purvis and Co. in capturing the charismatic Dillinger and his men. Johnny Depp was a real straight-shooter with his enigmatic but bulls-eye performance as Dillinger. Christian Bale's acting pursuit as one of the elite in the biz took another leap higher with his driven work here as Purvis. Marion Cotillard proved that she suffered no acting letdown, after her Best Actress Oscar, with her strong supportive work here as the Dillinger gal Billie. Speaking of Billies, Billy Crudup crudely transformed himself into J. Edgar Hoover with authentic prowess. Maybe I was hit too hard with Ronan Bennett's complex screenplay, but at times I was lost with 'Public Enemies' verbose rounds. Nevertheless, it was Mann who captures his audience by Mannly displaying the Dillinger crime life and his ultimate demise in sheer entertainment fashion. 'Public Enemies' might not be the #1 film in my 'most wanted' 2009 film list at years end, but most probably will be gunned up as one of the best of the year. ***** Excellent",9,60,119,18 July 2009
The Babadook," Essie is the easy reason to give this one a ba ba look
","The Australian horror film 'The Babadook' was not as haunting as I thought it was going to be. Maybe all the 'baba blabber' about how magnificent the film was garnered high expectations for me. Writer-Director Jennifer Kent's movie stars Aussie actress Essie Davis as Amelia, mother to young child Samuel who warns mummy that the fictional title character in a children's book called Babadook will enter their home and cause horror havoc. Amelia ignores Samuel's warnings and, not to play Bada Spoiler, you pretty much can assume the rest. Kent did not really construct any spooky elements to the picture; and it was somewhat predictable. Now I must exorcist, I mean exercise my right as a ghost corny film critic, to mention that Aussie Essie was auuuuustanding as Amelia. Child Actor Noah Wiseman was on his novice thespian ark (whatever that is) quite bravely with his stunning role as young Samuel. 'The Babadook' was not totally a bad bad spook, but it could have been better. *** Average",7,0,3,21 July 2015
The Danish Girl," This Danish is not worth the dough!
","Director Tom Hooper's period piece 'The Danish Girl' is based on the courageous true story of Einar Wegener who was the first man to go under the knife to transform into a woman who became Lili Elle. Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne did a credible job in his or her transformation into the character or characters of Einar and Lili, but don't think it was Oscar-worthy. Alicia Vikander co-stars as Einar/Lili's conflicted but supporting wife Gerda Wegener. Alicia hit her wonderland earlier this year when she won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance here. And Vikander's work was the highlight of the movie. What needs to be transformed a bit was Hooper's lackadaisical direction of the picture. Lucinda Coxon's screenplay was also not worth a danish doughnut. However, it should not discredit the courage that the real Lili went through. Nevertheless, I do not recommend a date with the movie 'The Danish Girl'. *** Average",6,0,1,1 October 2016
The Girl Next Door," Do not say nay to this neighbor!
","Come on guys! Let's face it! We have always had a crush with the girl next door! It has always been a guilty pleasure, but in so peculiar way it has been a lust for life! Come on, you peeping Toms! Express yourself! You know you have! 'The girl next door' has to rank as the #1 object of desire for the master of your domain. You get my thrift! Those girls next door sure did 'cum' in handy! Anyway, the film 'The Girl Next Door' is really like your 'girl next door' herself: it's a jollity guilty pleasure! Emile Hirsch stars as Matthew Kidman, a nouveau riche high school senior who must execute an eloquent speech in order to get a Georgetown University scholarship. However, for this 'George' hopeful 'Bush' gets in the way. The luscious Elisha Cuthbert co-stars as Danielle, who else but the girl next door. Matthew falls for Danielle (no doubt). Even though I like the sound of Danielle falls for Joel better (even rhymes). I almost forgot to mention the Triple XXX files aspect of the story: Danielle is porn to be alive! Yea, she is a reincarnation of 'Roller Girl'. She is a porn star!!! Anyway, havoc occurs when the simpleton Matthew is faced with challenging situations after he founds out the naked truth about Danielle. The rest of the story is just fun film popcorn entertainment, even though some more things might be popping after you see the beauty of Elisha Cuthbert. 'The Girl Next Door' will not change your life but always remember 'like a good neighbor, porn star is there'. **** Good",8,0,2,31 December 2004
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Catch Some Scatch Fever!
","'Ice Age: The Meltdown' is the sequel to the computer animated classic which melted many of our hearts with its creativity and pleasantry. The sequel did have its stellar flashes, but it does not heat up fast enough for me to surpass its superb predecessor. Manny the Mammoth, Diego the Saber-tooth Tiger, and Sid the Sloth are back as our prehistoric protagonists. This time the Ice Age is over and starting to melt so they must reunite and coldly warn everyone the hot news. The crew is enlarged by the addition of Ellie the Mammoth (who thinks she is a possum) and her petite pussies, I mean possies (forgot this is a kid flick) Crash and Eddie. Sid still adequately delivers his comical delusions of grandeur and Diego is still the 'light saber' which lights up the screen because of his cool presence. However, it was Manny who I was disappointed with. He was not the principal mammoth who we respected in the first saga. It was a huge disappointment. Another cold downfall of the film is that it lacks a primary antagonist which we love to hate. The scene stealer of 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' as its forerunner is no other than Scrat the Squirrel. The Stray Scrat rocks the house with his hilarious mishaps! 'Ice Age: The Meltdown' has been a big box office hit and definitely does not have to worry about frozen assets. The film is worthy of its financial prize because children will love it. I just wish Director Carlos Santana , I mean Saldhana, would have shown more his 'evil ways' by incorporating a magnetic villain and would of made Manny the Mammoth a bit more extinct. Nevertheless, I do slightly recommend you all to see 'Ice Ice Baby' to go. *** Average",7,0,0,23 April 2006
Ted," Da Bear!
","Here are the bear facts: The comedy 'Ted' is quite a treat, and it's one of the best 'laugh-out-loud' comedies of 2012. Director Seth MacFarlane's concept of a raunchy talking bear is something that might sound silly on paper, but it's quite amusing on screen. 'Ted' stars Mark Wahlberg as John Bennett, a Bostonian who as a result of a childhood wish, caused his toy bear Ted to come to life; too bad he did not have a Bikini Barbie. Consequently, the talking bear Ted becomes an instant celebrity as a result that he is a talking bear. John and Ted become best buddies throughout John's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. John and Ted do all those things that guys do with their toy bears like smoke pot, rent hookers, get drunk, and talk smack. Lori, John's girlfriend of four years, gets impatient when she continuously observes that John is not willing to mature into a matrimony state mainly because of his man-child behavior with Ted. So therefore, John and Ted's friendship is put to the test. I will not divulge more on the 'Ted' narrative because it is something you have to see for yourself; if you have not already. But let me tell you this in in a flash, the 70's sci- fi remake of 'Flash Gordon' and its star Sam J. Jones play an important part in 'Ted'. Again, you just have to see for yourself, if you can bear controlling the laughter of this uproarious inclusion. 'Ted' is MacFarlane's baby, and he excels in his hilarious scribe of the picture and his pinpoint direction; and I should also voice to you that he voices Ted riotously. Wahlberg proves again that he can depart from drama to comedy with ease in his performance as John. Mila Kunis was efficient in her work as Lori. And by the way, Mila could bear hug me any time! Like that's going to happen! But it was Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, yes Sam J. Jones, who came out of nowhere to deliver the top 'far out' performance of the picture. 'Ted' delivers the bear necessities for a comedy to shine, so give it a bear chance. ***** Excellent",9,4,8,19 January 2013
Coffee and Cigarettes," Gabbby Smoking!!!!!!
","In our history, there have been numerous humanoids who probably had too much coffee in their lifetime: Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, Benny Hill, Kathy Griffin, myself for that matter, and Dick Vitale. Moreover, there have been some that have smoked too many cigarettes: Johnny Carson, The Marlboro Man, Colin Farrell, Kiefer Sutherland, Jim Leyland, Smokey the Bear (oops! that's the antithesis), and The Camel Dude. However, there have been many which have had perceptive and didactic conversations having 'Coffee & Cigarettes'. Ironically enough, that is the main premise of Jim Jarmusch's film 'Coffee & Cigarettes'. You have heard that coffee & cigarettes definitely does cause harmful health situations, but le flick 'Coffee & Cigarettes' definitely does cause exceptional intellectual stimulations. The film is comprised of several chatty coffee & cigarettes vignettes. They are embodied by such Hollywood cafeinados & nicoaddictos as: Bill Murray, Tom Waits, Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Jack & Meg White, Alfred Molina, Steven Coogan, Steven Wright, Roberto Benigni, and Cate Blanchett. The film's 'cr√®me' a la crop vignettes which 'lit' it up were: Molina & Coogan's 'Distant Cousins', Blanchett's own 'Cousins', Buscemi's 'Elvis' Brother', and Pop & Waits' 'Jukebox'. The ones that probably had too much 'black' on them and included no 'matches' in cinema superiority were: the White Stripes machine bit, the waiter & hot chic bit, and Benigni & Wright's 'Strange to Meet You'. The top acting nods that stirred up the pot accordingly was Molina's searching cousin, Blanchett's dual cousin, and Murray's cofffe mug chugger. Jarmusch's screenplay was wistful, realistic, and variable. 'Coffee & Cigarettes' has the perfect combination to make it one of the most insightful films of the year. **** Good",8,1,2,30 January 2005
Spider-Man 2," I see Red in this Sequel!
","Many critics have labeled 'Spiderman 2' as the best superhero film ever. The film was quite entertaining, but I think many of these critics got caught up in the spider trap. As its infamous predecessor- the film did incorporate sensational special effects, paradoxical personal dilemmas, sacrificing love intricacies, and stirring action sequences. However, to say that it was much better than the original would be an overstatement. I think these critics were 'climbing off the walls' with their calenture for 'Spiderman 2'. Sam Raimi must be once again commended for his swashbuckling direction of 'Spiderman 2'. Raimi, who directed my own personal favorite superhero film 'Darkman', is the premier director for this type of film genre. Tobey Maguire's performance as the web-slinging crusader was adequate but not of superheroic proportions. Alfred Molina was quite a handful or should I say handfuls as the villainous Dr. Octopus (Ock). However, the remaining supporting cast of 'Spiderman 2' (James Franco, Kirsten Dunst, and Rosemary Harris) did not entrap me too much into their world wide web of acting. They were far better in the original. In spide, I mean spite of it all, 'Spiderman 2' is still one worth hanging on to and checking out. **** Good",7,0,1,15 July 2005
The Secret in Their Eyes," A secret masterpiece!
","You are just too good to be true, can't keep my eyes off of you! And boy is that true in viewing the mastery of the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language motion picture 'The Secret in Their Eyes'. The Argentinean flick is directed by Juan Jose Campanella. If Campanella's name does ring a bell, it is because he is not only an acclaimed Argentinean auteur but also has directed numerous episodes of the critically-acclaimed television series 'House M.D.'. Campanella also co-wrote 'The Secret in Their Eyes' with Eduardo Sacheri. This movie is unlike any you have laid your eyes on before! Campanella masters the craft of developing unpredictable journeys on where the narrative of this film takes you to. 'The Secret in their Eyes' stars Ricardo Darin as Benjamin Esposito, a retired lawyer who decides to write a novel on a murder case he was assigned to many years ago that still haunts him in his present life. In returning to the undiscovered aftermath scenarios of the case, Benjamin's buttons are pushed in so many variations. I will not divulge too much on the case because that will be a bit of plot snitching on the secret of 'The Secret in Their Eyes'. I will state that in rediscovering the case, he reunites with a past female attorney colleague Irene Menendez Hastings. Benjamin always held a secret love for Irene but was not hasty enough to express his love for her, due to the nature of the infamous case. During the time Benjamin and Irene were working on the case, they had the assistance of a wisecracking, inebriated attorney colleague Ricardo Morales. He provides the film's comic relief of an emotionally-wrenched narrative. Campanella and Sacheri's screenplay is as intense and compelling as they come! And Campanella's directorial vision of 'The Secret in Their Eyes' was 20/20 perfect! His skilled orchestration of interchanging between past and present was one of the movie's finest assets. The cast of 'The Secret in Their Eyes' was phenomenal! Darin's daring starring performance as Esposito was undeniably outstanding. But he was not alone, because Soledad Villamil's work as the captivating Irene was up to par with Darin's effort. And not to be left undone, Pablo Rago was exactly no rag doll with his scene-stealing performance as Morales. 'The Secret in Their Eyes' was most worthy of its Best Foreign Film Academy Award, and that is no secret. ***** Excellent",10,1,2,8 January 2011
Billy Elliot," Good But Not For All The Billing It Has Received
","`Billy Elliot' is the newest british import billed to us. It is a pretty good one. The movie is about an 11 year old british lad who becomes fascinated with the art of ballet. Billy lives in a mining town with an abusive father, a selfish brother, and a zany grandmother. I guess that is enough for any young lad to go cookoo and put on a tutu. Newcomer Jamie Bell is definitely no acting `ding dong.' He just might dance away with an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Also, Julie Walters, who plays the chain smoking ballet instructor, might just waltz away with a Best Supporting Actress nomination herself. `Billy Elliot' did have a few falls though. For example, its concentration on the mining strike definitely did not strike it rich it to my liking. All in all, `Billy Elliot' is one that is worth a few bills to spend on and go check out. *** Average",7,1,1,24 November 2000
127 Hours," Not going to be a rocky road for James Franco from now on! Franco reaches new heights!
","Director Danny Boyle probably had some type of massive rock fall on his head as a kid and is probably the main reason why he is such a maniacal auteur who does not play within the conventional rules of orchestrating a film; as depicted in his directorial work in such movies as 'Trainspotting', '28 Days Later', and the Oscar-winning 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Danny Boy has done it again in the gripping '127 Hours', the movie based on the true story of mountain climber Aaron Ralston. While canyoneering in Utah 2003, Ralston had a boulder crash on his arm; trapping him in an isolated canyon for (yea, you guessed it) 127 hours! Ralston's remarkable survival story is what entraps viewers in '127 Hours'. Boyle is definitely not a lazy director, and his energy and workmanship is shown around the clock in '127 Hours'; from Aaron's survival skills, to the expeditious visuals of Aaron's adventuristic persona, to Aaron's desperate motives of detachment; I hope I did not have to arm wrestle with your brain in figuring that last one out. Speaking of detachment, the 'arm self-amputation' scene of the movie is the one that is stirring a buzz in movie world. It's the authenticity of the scene and not so much its graphic nature that makes it work. And of course, the bold Boyle is responsible for its excellence. '127 Hours' screenplay was mediocre at best; probably due to the nature of the movie, so I am not trying to take anything away from the film's screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Boyle himself. Nature and its catastrophic capabilities play an integral role in the film highlighted by the superb technical work of: Cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, Art Director Christopher DeMuri, and Production Designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They all deserve Oscar nominations! Jon Harris' master cutting in editing the movie, and A.R. Rahman's master tuning in scoring the movie are also climbing the Oscar mountain of nominations for those applicable categories. But to be 'Franco' with you, the peak of '127 Hours' has to be James Franco's mesmerizing performance as Aaron Ralston. I will give my right arm (I know, wrong choice of words; Sorry Aaron!) to have James Franco be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Wait a minute! I don't think I would have to give my right arm since he is already a favorite for a Best Actor Oscar nomination! Sorry, I guess I was arm & hammered when I wrote that last statement. Anyways, Franco's emotional, rawpower thespian work will definitely make the cut as one of the most talked about acting performance of the year. There is not much of a supporting acting ensemble to '127 Hours' since it was Franco's showcase. But we did get a treat in seeing veteran actor Treat Williams appear as Aaron's dad; and there were a couple of sharp performances from Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as mountain climbers that Aaron meets before his downfall. I will not proclaim '127 Hours' as the best movie of the year; it still has a few mountains to climb before it reaches that apex. But nevertheless, Franco and Boyle definitely make it worth your while to spend 93 minutes with '127 Hours'. It rocks! **** Good",8,3,8,4 December 2010

Therefore, Peter goes on 'mandates' to find a best buddy to be his best man at his wedding. Peter is also on a real estate mission in trying to sell Lou Ferrigno's (Yes, the Incredible Hulk himself) mansion which make many of Pete's colleagues green with envy. Jason Segel co-stars as Sydney Fife, a straight-shooter bohemian beach slacker who Peter befriends and before you know it Peter is the main dog in 'The Big Fife Club'. Peter and Sydney's novice friendship becomes the central narrative association of 'I Love You, Man'. Oscar amigos, please consider Paul Rudd for a Best Actor nomination at your next award soiree. His performance as the semi-neurotic, somewhat-pretentious but extremely likable Peter was a comedic tour-de-force. Segel was not lagging too much behind with his picture-perfect performance as the comedically candid Sydney. I Love You, Paul & Jason men for bringing back the 'comedic actor duo chemistry' subject back into the movie curriculum. The film also greeted us with show-stopping supporting performances from: Rashida Jones as Peter's fianc√© Zooey, Jon Favreau & Jamie Pressly as Zooey's bickering married friends Barry & Denise, the great J.K. Simmons as Peter's dad Oswald Klaven, Andy Samberg as Peter's younger gay brother Robbie, and Lou Ferrigno for his muscular self-parody acting effort. Writer-Director John Hamburg's tasty script and orchestration of 'I Love You Man' was stellar, and exact sentiments goes out to the 'Hamburg Helpers' that aided him to make 'I Love You, Man' a Hamburg creation lacking with cheesy material but with enough witty beef to satisfy your comedic taste buds.

Actually, the `Finding Mula' I am referring to are the astronomical profits of `Finding Nemo'. This is the supreme jewel from the Disney/Pixar winning collaboration. Oceanography will never be the same because of the film's existentialism cinematography. Moreover, the screenplay of Nemo is in the school of the great Disney comical scribes. The acting voices were also primo! Albert Brooks as the neurotic Marlin was simply in the class of Fisher Island.

Creed," Increedible!
","I promise I will not knock you out with a bunch of punnercuts with my review of the latest film installment of the Rocky franchise called 'Creed'. Yo, I lied. Anyways, 'Creed' is a marvelous picture which should round out in my list as one of the top films, if not the top, of 2015. 'Creed' stars uprising actor Michael B. Jordan as young boxer Adonis Johnson. Adonis is also the son of Apollo Creed; and I don't have to tell you who Apollo is, unless you are spaced out with the Rocky flicks. Adonis wants to make his own name in boxing so he seeks the training help of the late Apollo's friend & competitor; the one & only Rocky Balboa. Balboa is played by..... really, do I have to tell you who it is? Come on, this is about the eight count of Rocky movies, so we all know it's Sylvester Stallone. Rocky now is an aging Philly restaurant owner who has lost both his wife Adrian and his brother-in-law Paulie. Rocky is first reluctant to train Adonis, but with some soul searching, he changes his mind. Rocky later discovers that he has to put up with another fight, no ring required in this one but it turns out to be his most important fight. 'Creed' is proficiently directed by Ryan Coogler. Ryan's hope was not to discredit the Rocky franchise, and his hope came true with his unanimous stellar direction of 'Creed'. He also put in some inspiring write jabs with fellow scriber Aaron Covington with their heartfelt screenplay of 'Creed'. Jordan has to be a slam dunk for a Best Actor Oscar nomination with his powerful performance as Adonis. And a Stallone Academy Award nomination playing 'Rocky' might just make a comeback to the Oscar ring with what should certainly be a Best Supporting Actor nomination. I also admired the performances of Tessa Thompson as Adonis' love interest and Phylicia Rashad as Creed's adoptive mother. I won't reveal much more of 'Creed' because that would give this review a 'black eye'; not that it doesn't have a few already. 'Creed' is my second favorite of the 'Rocky' franchise; still prefer the original by a split decision. So get creedy, and feel the 'Creed'. ***** Excellent",10,4,8,7 December 2015

Oh, and these two relatively unknowns Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston play the plastic surgeon Danny and his assistant Katherine, just go with it. I actually think that Director Dennis Dugan's masterpiece 'Just Go With It' should be nominated for a plethora of Oscars for next year's ceremony, and be the first comedy to win a Best Picture Academy Award since 'Annie Hall'. Come on, I am having some fun, just go with it! Let me go back to the narrative of 'Just Go With It'. Because of plastic-lies surgeon Danny's continuous lies & fabrication, a lot of silly stuff transpires in the movie which leads the film's characters into Hawaii, even though there was not much Alo ha ha ha in those scenes. Now there were a few that I went with and made me chuckle, but not nearly enough. Sandler and Aniston looked like they were simply just 'going with it' to collect a paycheck. News Flash: Decker is not the second coming of Michelle Pfeiffer but she is sure one that could cause many other second comings, we will just leave it at that. Nick Swardson's performance as Danny's cousin Eddie is deserving of the MOCAT Award, that would be playing the 'Most Obnoxious Character of All Time'; even though I have to admit that his sheep scene was not a piece of ¬Ö. (well, you know). Oh, and Tom Cruise's ex also shows up in this one also; and I am not talking about Mimi Rogers, Katie Holmes (eventually that will happen), or Ms. Scientology (look at last parentheses comment). I am not kidding, Kidman is in this movie, and is not a cameo either. 'Just Go With It' was actually scribed by two screenwriters, Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling. I guess it does take two to make a word thing go wrong. OK, it was not that bad, there were a few zingers here and there that made me laugh; but again not nearly enough! If you do not take it too seriously and take it for what it is, 'Just Go With It' might just pass go with you. But if you are expecting an authentic witty comedy, then simply don't go with it. *** Average",7,0,3,15 February 2011
Brokeback Mountain," Cowboy Hats off to Brokeback Mountain
","'Love is a force of nature' is the acknowledged tagline of the critically acclaimed Ang Lee film 'Brokeback Mountain'. However, 'Mother Nature' nor in this case 'Gay Father Nature' could have predicted that this little independent film about two Wyoming ranch cowboys who endure a twenty-year old secret romance would create such a cinematic force. 'Brokeback Mountain' will undoubtedly ride off with numerous Oscar golden boys; come on, those gay cowboys sure like those shiny naked boys. Brokeback Mountain is an incandescent film that contains one of the most breathtaking cinematography I have ever seen in a motion picture. The musical score of Brokeback also successfully juxtaposes the narrative's reticent themes. Heath Ledger turns in a remarkable performance as Ennis Del Mar, the taciturn cowboy who marries his accommodating country gal Alma. Michelle Williams' work as Alma was one of the 'Alma Matters' salute material. Both are deserving of their Oscar nominations. Jake Gyllenhaal, plays Gay Cowboy #2 Jack Twist. He is the most unrestrained of the two who desperately pursues a committal romance between Ennis and him. However, the real 'twist' of 'Brokeback Mountain' comes in when 'he will be coming around the Brokeback Mountain when Ennis comes'. Gyllenhaal also scored a Best Supporting Actor nod for his affectionate performance. Anne Hathaway plays Lureen Newsome, Twist's imperious wife who probably should have looked at his 'Gay Cowboy Diary' instead of her 'Princess Diary' to seek the truth what got 'Jack off'. Director Ang Lee's film 'which could have easily been titled 'Crouching Cowboy receives Hidden Dragon', was really a lucid film about forbidden love in a stillness environment. Lee's efforts are commendable. The only area where I have to say 'hold your horses' and say that is was overrated is in the film's lackluster screenplay. Let's just say that 'I could quit that type of wordage.' Nevertheless, this film is picturesque, thought-provoking, and revolutionary enough for me to get on my high horse and recommend 'Brokeback Mountain'. **** Good",8,6,13,7 February 2006
Spotlight," Spot on!
","You spotlight up my life, you give me hope, to carry on... Sorry to get all Debbie Booneish on you in my intro on my review of the spectacular movie 'Spotlight'. Director Tom McCarthy's movie about the true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese is shaking up to the be the frontrunner of the Best Picture Oscar, and why not? McCarthy's meticulous direction of the film and his layering of its expose was a sermonial, I mean a ceremonial piece of mastery. The Boston Globe's investigative 'Spotlight' department shined on unveiling this disturbing truth. What was not disturbing was the exemplary acting performances from the actors playing the 'spotlight' write players; including Mark Ruffalo as the emotional Mike Rezendes, Rachel McAdams as the conflicted Sacha Pfeiffer, Brian D'arcy James as the cerebral Matt Carroll, and the 'Birdman' himself Michael Keaton as the group's leader Robby Robinson. Keaton and Ruffalo were the standouts here, but all should be given the proper spotlight for their commendable acting. Other fine thespian turns came from Stanley Tucci as the counsel Mitchell Garadebian, Liev Schrieber as the paper's new editor Marty Baron, and John Slattery as the associate editor Ben Bradlee. It will be very sad if this acting group does not get the SAG Best Acting Ensemble Award. McCarthy's script with fellow screenplayer Josh Singer had all of the write stuff of a multi- dimensional narrative covering an uncomfortable subject matter. Sure, the film does depict journalists as literary superheroes, but their procedural process workings was their greatest weapon to get rid of the darkness of the subject they were investigating; and it isn't that what superheroes do? or something like that? Anyways, I pray that 'Spotlight' receives many Oscar nominations, as it should. So, it's now time for you to see and then share the 'Spotlight'. ***** Excellent",10,8,15,25 November 2015
Insomnia," Nolan is Masterful!
","The grandiloquent directors of our time have the niche to implement a certain theme into masterful storytelling. One of them is Director Christopher Nolan. No one could forget his ingenious direction for last year's sleeper hit `Memento'. He has done the same for this year's unsleeper hit `Insomnia'. If you forgot, `Memento' focused on a short-term memory loss amnesiac who utilized mementos devices such as inscribed tattoos and polaroid photographs as aids to his disability in order to solve a murder mystery. In `Insomnia', it focuses on an insomniac detective who uses his crafty police-work and his masterful discretion as aids to his disability in order to solve a murder mystery. Al Pacino stars as the restless detective. His performance should open the eyes to academy award voters during oscar time. The godfather of all actors proves once again why there is not a challenging role he can't refuse. I was quite `alarmed' to see Robin Wiliams playing the heavy; but he was quite impressive as the sadistic psycho. Also, Hilary Swank does deserve accolades for her role as the junior inquisitive police officer. However, the true light of the film that opened my eyes widely was the innovative direction of Christopher Nolan. This 32 year old brit is one of the best bright minds of theatrical filmmaking. So see the light at the end of the tunnel (or at the end of the movie theatre line) and see `Insomnia' today! ***** Excellent",9,0,0,26 May 2002
500 Days of Summer," Summer Loving had me a blast!
","This is not a movie review, it is my punfested non-linear take on my 95 minute experience viewing & digesting the groundbreaking romantic comedy of the year '500 Days of Summer'. 26th minute- Wow, I am flabbergasted that this witty romantic comedy does not construct itself with the standard cinematic norm of most other films by continuing to reveal the plot in a non-chronological system. 74th minute- Joseph Gordon-Levitt's starring performance as Tom, the 'hopeless romantic' greeting card writer has to be considered for a Best Actor Oscar nomination for the authenticity he invokes in the character. 6th minute- God, Zooey Deschanel is so hot! Nominate her for a Best Actress Oscar for just prettiness magnetism alone. 62nd minute- Zooey is not just an 'acquired taste' bombshell but she also delivers a restrained but accurate performance as Summer, the greeting card administrative assistant which Tom romances even though she does not reciprocate the same romantic stance towards him throughout most of the relationship. 34th minute- How cool! An entertaining Karaoke scene in the movie, you just don't get enough of good ones in movie scenes these days. 80th minute- Director Mark Webb's definitely has me caught up in his atypical web of developing a romance with a foreseeable breakup where boy is much more into it than girl, we as male species have all been there. Mark gets high marks from me for his auteur efforts here. 23rd minute- How cool! That is The Smith's 'There is a Light That Never Goes Out' that Tom is listening to on his headphones in the elevator. I love that song and so far this movie! 1st minute- I hope '500 Days of Summer' lives up to all the hype people have been buzzing about this presumed creative movie. 58th minute- Man, I gotta go pee but I do not want to miss a second of this overwhelmingly creative movie. 58th and a half minute- OK, I am back, wow that was one of the fastest urinal releases I have had in my life; I hope I did not wet my pants with the quick shake (T.M.I. Alert!) 81st minute- Scott Neustadter & Michael Weber's super clever screenplay of this movie is my favorite so far this year in that department. Man, I know I could have revealed my feelings for that in a more witty fashion. I was just flabbergasted with the verbal wit of Scott and Michael's screenplay which has left me relatively punless. 66th minute- Feeling the thespian love of the commendable supporting performances of Geoffrey Arend as Tom's greeting card colleague & pal McKenzie and Clark Gregg as Tom's evenhanded supervisor Vance. 53rd minute- I hope I get at least a semi-nude glimpse of Zooey's left breast in this sex scene between Tom & Summer. 95th minute- '500 Days of Summer' will most certainly be in my Top 10 List at year's end! Loved it! 96th minute- Did I valet my parking pass? Dizzy? Sorry! Nevertheless, the right order you should take is to go to the movies and feel the innovative warmth of '500 Days of Summer'. ***** Excellent",10,1,3,13 August 2009
Juno," This Juno is not cold!
","The quirky revolutionary comedy 'Juno' has impregnated the birth of the verbose juggernaut of our present youthful society in cinematic screens. Writer Diablo Cody's innovative screenplay is a call to present to us how many of our teenagers and young adults dingo the lingo. Before I let more of the Diablo inside of me and marvel on the wonder of Cody's screenplay, let me inform you the embryonic state of the 'Juno' plot. The articulate Ellen Page plays Juno MacGuff, a high school teenager who gets pregnant and wishes to give the baby up to child-seeking parents who are wealthy & mature enough to care for the offspring. Juno is a prototypical cerebral 2007 teenager, who even though she speaks a modern & idiosyncratic lingo and demonstrates a mature demeanor, she still possesses the archetypal egocentric characteristics of a high school teenager. Juno was given the 'stickin to the cliting' by her introverted best friend Paulie Bleeker. Paulie is in his high school's track team but he does not run away from Juno's oven ordeal. Leah is Juno's best friend and I will be 'leahying' if I said she did not act like your typical Americana teenager. Mac MacGuff is Juno's understanding & supporting pop who does hold some reservation on 'le pregno situation' but still stands by Juno in her baby steps decisions. Bren is Juno's stepmother who is open to the times so she also lends a helping hand. Mark & Vanessa Loring are the yuppie couple who made the Juno cut and will parent the Mini-Juno once it makes it earthly debut. These are the zany but charismatic characters of 'Juno' and thank God they entered our cinematic existence. The ensemble acting of 'Juno' was uno for the thespian ages. Ellen Page's performance as the title character was the best I have seen this year by a female actress. J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney's work as Mac & Bren was an acting planned parenthood that delivered. Jason Bateman & Jennifer Garner adopted some positive acting points in my book portraying Mark & Vanessa Loring. I especially thought that Bateman was phenomenal and there was some 'arrested development' going on when he did not make the cut of the Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominations. What can I say but 'Que Cera, Que Cera' for upcoming young actor Michael Cera's 'unbleaky' performance as Paulie Bleeker. Olivia Thirlby also thrilled me with her work as Juno's BFF Leah. I guess after all hipster Director Jason Reitman was the right modern man for the job to deliver the birth of 'Juno'. I am glad the film's producers made the right house calls in selecting Reitman as the film's auteur. But I must return to hell and feed you more Diablo; because Cody's ingenious screenplay was the lump that made 'Juno' grow into one wondrous comedic doodle that can't be undone. So take a bite out of your time by visiting Juno MacGuff and company. 'Juno' what I mean! ***** Excellent",10,1,9,28 January 2008
Concussion," I concur that Will Smith rocked in 'Concussion'
","Set Hut Hut Hut.... Yes, that was my opener of a film review about a football-based movie. Was it original? Of course not! Should I be penalized for unreviewlike intro conduct? Yaaa! But I got your attention, your still reading (at least for now). Yes, you are not the only one that thinks that I should get my head examined. Speaking of heads, the movie 'Concussion' is definitely an eye- opener on the damage that football-related concussions can do to the brain that can eventually causes thoughts of suicide, depression, and schizophrenia, among others. The movie is based on a true story and stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, an accomplished Pittsburgh pathologist who discovered the aforementioned complications that football-related concussions can incur on the brain while autopsying the brain of Pittsburgh NFL Hall-of-Famer Mike Webster; who sadly committed suicide at age 50. Omalu did have to tackle his biggest opponent for this theory to be considered authentic; and that would be a little league we call the National Football League; heard of it? Smith's superb performance as Omalu should land him in the Best Actor Oscar nomination roster; and if it doesn't, I think the Academy should (yes, you guessed it; had to use it again) get their heads examined. Writer-Director Peter Landesman gets solid auteur points for his direction & script of the film; however, there were a few directorial fumbles with some formulaic scenes between Omalu and his wife Prema, and the miscast of Luke Wilson as NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was a castaway disaster. The supporting performances that came to play were of Gugu Mbatha- Raw as Prema, and David Morse as Webster. The rest were adequate (including the work of acclaimed actors Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks) but I would not consider their work as first-string caliber. So head on over and examine 'Concussion' today. **** Good",8,3,9,29 December 2015
Don Jon," Satisfying but not completely orgasmic
","Joseph Gordon-Levitt's 'Don Jon' is a bit self-absorbed, but it still delivers the goods as an enjoyable entertainment fare. Gordon-Levitt stars as Jon, a New Jersey Guido-like ladies' man who is addicted to pornography; but still manages to be devoted to his church & family. His friends and hooking up with the ladies also play instrumental to his life, but unfortunately Jon needs to be 'born again' instead of 'porn again'. His pornography addiction does get out of hand; sort of speak. Jon does hook up with a sexbomb Guidoette in the voluptuous Barbara Sugarman. I guess his 'searching for Sugarman' was a sweet find. Barbara is a chick-flick lover, but not the same type of 'chick flicks' that Jon logs on to. Jon also befriends an older night school peer in the depressed Esther who plays vital in his development. 'Don Jon' is Gordon-Levitt's baby, as he also wrote and directed the flick. His head- on direction and humorous screenplay did come with the goods, but the egoism behind most of his characters was a bit of a turn off. Gordon- Levitt's starring performance as Jon was solid but not spectacular. Scarlett Johansson was exquisite & debonair in her performance as Barbara, and Julianne Moore was great as always in her work as Esther. However, my favorite performance of 'Don Jon' was of Tony Danza who was a scene-stealer as Jon's vociferous father Jon Sr. Tony showed that he was the boss in the film's family dinner scenes who Gordon-Levitt also presented them in homage to the similar themed scenes in 'Saturday Night Fever'. I will not reveal if 'Don Jon' has a happy ending because that would be cinematically criminal. But I will reveal that you will feel most satisfied seeing this movie into its final climax. **** Good",8,0,0,5 January 2014
Match Point," A win for this Match!
","Woody Allen has been serving our comedic cravings for many decades. Love him or hate him, the 'Woodsman' has verifiably proved that he is a comedic cinematic genius and a master of storytelling within themes of neurosis, self-exploration, adultery, egoism, and obsession. His latest effort 'Match Point' serves up those themes with cinematic poetic justice. Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as tennis pro Chris Wilton, an opportunistic handsome Scottish lad who befriends a British yuppie named Tom Hewett played by Matthew Goode and eventually marries his sister played by Emily Mortimer. Let's just say that Chris wants to live a joyous 'Chrismas' lifestyle every day of the year by marrying into a wealthy family. The luscious Scarlett Johansson co-stars as Nola Rice, Tom's fianc√©e and Chris' American object of desire. I will not spoil a good cinematic match for you, but I will say that Chris' obsession for Nola does have enough probable cause for him to double fault and jeopardize his enriching plan. Johansson looks ravishing in the narrative. No doubt that 'Scarlett Fever' is hot! Murder does come into play in 'Match Point' during the latter part of the narrative. Rhys Meyers and Johansson were a superb acting duo with their ace performances. However, the main 'advantage' of 'Match Point' was the cleverness of Writer-Director Woody Allen. His triumphant return to cinematic excellence was done by the way of game, set, and 'Match Point'. ***** Excellent",9,1,2,31 March 2006
Yes Man," Maybe to 'Yes Man'
","Yes, you have decided to read my film review of Jim Carrey's latest comedy 'Yes, Man'. Good for you, you are taking chances! Because my film reviews are not the standard ones, but they definitely are unique. Jim! Jim! Jim! You are definitely one of my idols! I have been an avid supporter and jovial fan of all your films; including the drama ones. I have said 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' every time in dishing out the admission fee to check out your Carreyisms in your flicks. But Mr. Carrey, almighty Mr. Carrey, it causes me profound pain to say this but 'Yes, Man' is a No for me compared to your other comedic masterpieces. Carrey plays Carl Allen, a compulsive 'nosayer' who decides to turn and join the 'Yes Club For Men' after attending a motivational seminar. Carl then goes berserk with the yeses. He will say yes to just about anything and anyone. He then meets cutie Allison, lifelessly played by Zooey Deschanel, who he desires the most important yes from. For a few initial scenes, the yes scenes were comical; but then Carrey gets carried away with them and it overextends their yes welcome. The plot line of 'Yes, Man' is similar to Carrey's classic 'Liar, Liar', but the similarities cease there. 'Liar, Liar' was a laugh riot contrary to the underdeveloped or maybe one can argue overdeveloped 'Yes, Man'; and that is no lie! Director Peyton Reed did not develop enough creative comedic ingenuity in 'Yes, Man' to be considered 'The Reeder' of the comedy directorial parade this year. Screenwriters Nicholas Stoller and Jarred Paul were in 'No Man's Land' while writing the mediocre script of 'Yes, Man'. However, I must say 'yes, man' to Rhys Darby's hilarious turn as Carl's colleague Norman. And I also mildly enjoyed other supporting turns from John Michael Higgins playing a 'yes' motivational recruiter and Terence Stamp playing a motivational speaker. Those aforementioned supporting performances and a few hilarious gags from Carrey, I guess motivated me enough to give 'Yes, Man' a borderline 'Yes' recommendation; but not by much. *** Average",Null,0,1,27 January 2009
Midnight in Paris," A Midnight magical feast!
","I would encourage every cinema lover to take a stroll and walk into Woody Allen's latest gem 'Midnight in Paris'. Woody's 7,204th film (OK OK maybe he has not helmed that many) is an elegant nostalgic film that mentally transports you to another time & place; and isn't that what movies are primarily supposed to do! It's also an admirable love letter to the 'city of lights' which will illuminate Paris to those who love Pari and even to those who have marked the city off their 'favorites' map. Even if you're an 'anti-Pari', how could you not want to visit Paris after a viewing of 'Midnight'! So before it gets to midnight, let me not prolong this review any more and cut to the narrative chase. Owen Wilson stars as Gil, a disillusioned but successful Hollywood screenwriter working on a nostalgic novel, and who also longs to live in Paris. Californian Gil and his girlfriend Inez visit Paris on a leisure trip, and also occasionally meet with fellow Paris travelers John & Helen; who happen to be Inez's parents. Inez is a looker of a girlfriend for Gil but does not encompass the literary free-spirit and nostalgic demeanor that he possesses. She is also a domineering complainer who does not respect Gil's artistic passions. Gil is into the past, most notably the Golden Age of the 1920's including many of the artistic & literary legends that came out of that period. While in Paris, Gil is uninterested in spending time with Inez and her judgmental parents. To make matters worse, Gil also despises Paul, who is a supercilious American friend of Inez who also happens to run into Gil & Inez in Paris travels. Consequently, Gil decides to take solo walking strolls of Paris; and what he ends up encountering is beyond a 'blast from the past' in the streets of Paris. To detail Gil's 'media noche' Paris encounters would be an exercise of futility, because it does require a 'see it for yourself' experience. I will however provide a Midnight clue: if you are a literary and art aficionado of the Golden Age, you are going to definitely think those scenes struck gold. There were hardly any hysterics in 'Midnight Paris', and I am glad that there wasn't because that would have taken away from the film's magical magnitude. Woody Allen masterfully scribes & directs 'Midnight in Paris' with lively ingenuity and sheer stylishness. Woody might be a little 'French fried' by showcasing Paris a bit too often, but it actually plays well within the film's premise and narrative; and last I checked, the movie is called 'Midnight in Paris'. Owen Wilson has never been better, he is deserving of a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his captivating performance as Gil. Yes, I said it; Owen Wilson and Oscar did play out in the same sentence. Rachel McAdams was terrific as the superficial Inez. Michael Sheen delivered yet another exceptional performance here with his portrayal of Paul; remind me why Sheen has never been nominated for an Oscar? This is the Sheen that is winning with his acting! But the scene-stealer of 'Midnight in Paris' is Adrien Brody who only appears for five minutes in the movie, but I guarantee you will have a 'Dali' good time watching it. Johanna Debas and Darius Khondji should be shoo-ins for a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination for their picture-Paris-perfect cinematic photography of 'Midnight in Paris'. To be France I mean frank with you, this is the best movie I have seen so far in 2011. So go and catch a midnight show, a matin√©e, or any scheduled theatrical showing of 'Midnight in Paris'. You will have a golden time! ***** Excellent",10,2,6,11 June 2011
Youth," Get in touch with this 'Youth'!
","Ahhhh, 'Youth', if only we can all go back. Well, maybe we can't (of course this only refers to us mid-lifers and geriatrics), but at least we can satisfy ourselves a viewing of a very cerebral and insightful movie about two professional older men vacationing in an exotic grand European hotel; and that would be Writer-Director Paolo Sorrentino's 'Youth'. The film stars Michael Caine as Fred Ballinger, a retired composer who is pressured by the Queen's parliament to orchestrate one final concierto. Ballinger was famed as a composer of simple songs, but his life is not that simple. He has doubts about his urinary health, mourns about his institutionalized wife, and guilts about not providing enough attention to his daughter in his past due to his obsession with his work. Then there is Mick Boyle played by Harvey Keitel. Boyle is an aging film director who is past beyond his prime, but is working on a movie with a young group of screenwriters. Boyle plans to use his longtime actress muse Brenda Morel as the star of his movie. Sorrento delivers such a beautiful composition of Ballinger and Boyle's friendship in the picture. It was wonderful seeing them discuss so many topics that many seniors would discuss in conversation. Rachel Weisz plays Lena, Fred's daughter and assistant. Lena is going through major heartbreak as her husband has left her for a younger female pop star. Lena is devoted to her father even though she feels a bit of angst for him not being a devoted father in the past. Paul Dano comes in this picture branch as TV actor Jimmy Tree. Jimmy is at the hotel preparing for a role and takes a friendship and mentor-like liking to Fred. Tree is trying to leaves I mean leave his character stereotype of playing a robot in a popular television show. Sorrentino's movie is not for everyone, and it might take a couple of viewings to fully digest it, but his exquisite execution of 'Youth' is timeless and beautiful to see. Sorrentino's screenplay was also a delight. Luca Bigazzi's cinematography was big and wondrous. Caine orchestrates a Caine-like performance as orchestra-maestro Fred, but what do you expect? It's Michael 'The Man' Caine!! Keitel was adequate as Boyle but a bit outshined by his counterpart Caine. Weisz continues to give stellar performances as she does here as Lena. Oh, I need to save the Tree because Dano's simple work as Tree was also very admirable. But the ultimate scene-stealer in 'Youth' was the legendary Jane Fonda as Brenda Morel. Wow! Fonda hit it out of the park, even though she only went to bat once; meaning her role was very brief, but very lasting. So go and live and relive 'Youth' with a youthful viewing. ***** Excellent",9,1,2,10 September 2016
Zodiac," Sign in to this classic!
","Here goes my Meeza horoscope for Director David Fincher's masterpiece flick 'Zodiac', which is based on the real Zodiac serial killings that stalked the San Francisco and Northern California area in the 60's & 70's. The following are based from real horoscope readings from horoscope.com, with a little Fincher Zodiac twist to it.Aries: a well-meaning friend might encourage you into making DVD purchases that you can't really afford. If you find yourself being dragged off to the mall, then be prepared to explain exactly why you can't buy the fabulous item that your friend insists is so you! Unless it is the Zodiac DVD! It is too tempting to pass up! Taurus: Work or school matters will continue to dominate the week. The moon in your sign is doing you no favors: it could hold you back and draw out a particular matter long after it should be concluded. You might feel reluctant to try something new, but taking that tiny risk will be a useful tactic! It will be a tiny risk if you spend two hours and a half of your time watching the sensational Fincher 'Zodiac'. You will be transcended by Fincher's genial depiction of the still unsolved Zodiac mystery and the obsession brought upon it by law enforcement, journalists, and even amateur sleuths. And I am not feeding you no Taurus bull either! Gemini: Yesterday's unhelpful influences are likely to ease only a little: communications will be tricky, with silly misunderstandings escalating tensions. Don't be afraid to take a breather or suggest a little time out if a mini-row develops. A good mood can be restored if you offer the olive branch! A good mood can also be restored by locking in to the splendid subtle-comedic performance of Robert Downey Jr. as gabby San Francisco Chronicle reporter Paul Avery in 'Zodiac'. It does have my support as one of the 'gems' in supporting acting this year! The Zodiac hounded Avery with death threats so much that many San Franciscans started wearing 'I Am Not Avery' buttons! Cancer: Romance will offer some nice surprises today, but there's a danger that you'll be a little too absorbed in how great things are for you to notice someone's, possibly a friend's slumping mood. Be altruistic today: pay attention to the person who needs you, even if it means putting romance on hold for a little while! You can be altruistic by treating someone you love to a nice surprise and buying them the next Two-Disc Zodiac DVD with a plethora of special features! Leo- Leos, with their love of fun and extravagance, have been known to make grand, over-the-top gestures from time to time, and today is one of those days where you are likely to do just that, especially when it comes to romance! Rein it in a little: you don't need to break the bank to impress someone! A nice gesture from the Academy would of have been to nominate James Vanderbilt's insightful 'Zodiac' screenplay for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. I guess most of the Academy members are not Leos! Virgo- You are likely to wake up feeling like you just want to avoid the whole rigmarole of the day, but the planets suggest that you'll be pleasantly surprised by the end of the day. A dip in your confidence levels is what's bringing you down: believe it or not, you'll attract a lot of positive attention! Lots of positive attention is what should have been received by critics for Jake Gyllenhaal's neurotically obsessed performance as Robert Graysmith, the former San Francisco Chronicler cartoonist who took a profound vested interest in the Zodiac investigation and actually started one up himself years after Zodiac signs were obsolete. Graysmith ended up authoring the best seller Zodiac books which the film is based on.Libra- You might have the day all worked out: what to do; when to do it; where; how and even why, but their might be one little detail you've overlooked, and that is: who! Whether you celebrate the day according to tradition or not you will need to be inclusive; you will need to consider others! And that is what I will do! I will consider other actors besides Gyllenhaal and Downey who were wondrous with their performances including: Mark Ruffalo as lead investigator David Toschi; I should do my own investigation why it was not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. Brian Cox as defense attorney/radio show host Melvin Belli, Anthony Edwards as Toschi's partner William Armstrong, and Chloe Sevigny as Graysmith's second wife Melanie round out the stellar acting signs of 'Zodiac'. I must single out John Carroll Lynch's scene stealing performance as Zodiac main suspect Arthur Leigh Allen as freakishly as they come. And too think that this Allen frenzied was in the Libra for so long is quite scary! Scorpio- You're likely to have a fabulous day in terms of romance, and an excellent aspect from the moon suggests that you'll be the center of attention, because someone is going to sit up and take notice of you today! There will also be the chance to get something off your chest once and for all! Unfortunately, director extraordinary David Fincher was not the center of attention during Oscar time by being snubbed for a Best Director nomination. I just wanted to get that off my chest.Can this review be any longer????? So I am skipping the rest of the signs! Anyway, I think I covered my viewpoints of 'Zodiac' from Horoscope A to Z! ***** Excellent",10,2,9,5 March 2008
Milk," Good Milk!
","Got Milk? Unfortunately, we don't got milk anymore in the form of 70's San Francisco gay rights leader/elected official Supervisor Harvey Milk. He was assassinated along with then San Francisco Mayor George Moscone in 1978 by a former S.F. Supervisor Dan White. Director Gus Van Sant's 'Milk' biographical diary film product turns out to be one of the emotional cinematic rousers of the year. Sean Penn milked it through with his performance as Harvey Milk; it is another 'Pennmanship' acting showstopper which should garner him a Best Actor Academy Award nomination. Josh Brolin goes from effectively playing a Bushman (Anti-Gay) White in 'W.' as President Bush to effectively playing another Bushman (Anti-Gay) White as Dan White. Brolin continues to broil it up with his recent paramount acting performances. Oh Josh! This might be your Oscar year! James Franco gives a frank and tender performance as Milk's longtime lover and campaign manager Scott Smith, and Emile Hirsh is the Emile acting ticket again by charismatically portraying an 'into the wild' Milk campaign apprentice called Cleve Jones. Openly gay Director Gus Van Sant constructively marches to the beat of his own drum by helming a profoundly inspirational narrative of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay person ever elected to political office. Milk's mission was not just about gay rights but about civil rights. So I think the Academy should be civil enough to consider Van Sant as a Best Director Oscar nominee. Van Sant's stock package of actual footage from the Milk era was an imperative ingredient to his 'Milk'. Dustin Lance Black's rookie screenplay of 'Milk' was a verbal juggernaut achievement in civil rights literacy. The 'Milk Chronicles' travel from Harvey's New York underachieving life to his resilient triumph to political candidacy in San Francisco to his tragic assassination in City Hall by White, and every Milk life drop in between. My only sour milk taste for 'Milk' was the just one too many 'rah rah' rally scenes. Nevertheless, 'Milk' was up to par within my cinematic taste. It is time for you to be 'Under the Milky Way' tonight and cinematically drink up a viewing of 'Milk'. **** Good",8,1,6,5 December 2008
Cloverfield," See the magic of Cloverfield!
","A monster movie set in New York? Why not? Maybe not in 2002! But I do not think acclaimed Producer/Director J.J. Abrams was 'lost' in left field and was timely appropriate in reintroducing the monster movie theme in present time via the narrative form in his 'Cloverfield'. Director Matt Reeves helms this surprisingly fine film about a grandiose monster attacking Manhattan. Hey, I have felt like a monster myself with a few too many Manhattan cocktails. What gives 'Cloverfield' a visionary edge is that all of the chaos is seen subjectively through the video camera of one of the film's characters named Hud. The film's narrative structure starts in a New York apartment where the lead character of the film Rob has been thrown a 'going away' surprise party by his friends; including Hud who is videotaping the guests testimonials about Rob using the soon-to-be infamous camera. But the real surprise comes right after in the clash of the Clover Monster; buildings explode, debris is everywhere, and even the head of the Statue of Liberty lands in the streets of Manhattan courtesy of monster Clover's unstatuette left hook. The rest of 'Cloverfield' focuses on the film's hipster characters trying to survive the Clover Monster's destruction. So to end my review of 'Clover√Ç‚Ä¶' Oh No! What's that coming at me! It is a humungous monster looking like a 300-foot Roger Ebert telling me to give it up as a film critic! AAHHH!!!! Where is my camera? I want a shot of this! His massive Thumbs Down is about to trample me! Help!!!! OK enough! I did enjoy the ensemble acting of 'Cloverfield' from newcomers Lizzy Kaplan, Jessica Lucas, Michael Stahl-David, and T.J. Miller. Stahl-David played Rob; and Miller played Lite, I mean Hud. 'Cloverfield' had extra special visual effects which were monstrous in recreating a New York tackled by a monster. I do not deny that 'Cloverfield' did a have a few silly rudiments to it, but it did not intercede within the sheer entertainment value of the film; or maybe it was that good luck clover that did it. Nevertheless, 'Cloverfield' does warrant for you to play its viewing field. **** Good",8,1,3,27 December 2009

Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Tailor-made to tinker with it!
","I do respect the spy suspense flick 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy', and I am glad I was finally able to tinker with it. But be ready to put your complete attention to this movie, or else you will be thinking that the movie is a 'stinker, failure, duller, please die' type of film. Do not think that this British spy thriller is filled with Martinis, Aston Martins, tuxedos, gadgets, and all those Bonderisms. This is not that type of movie. 'Tinker, Tailor, Solider, Spy' stars the masterful Gary Oldman as George Smiley, a semi-retired British espionage veteran who is forced back into the spy game by a government official to investigate who is a Russian mole in a high-intelligence British bureau called the Circus. Smiley doesn't smile much throughout the picture, and he just wants to make his mark in uncovering the mole, and then nonchalantly leave the Circus. The members of the Circus are a trapeze artist, a lion tamer, and a juggler. Oops! Wrong Circus! Just being a Clown! They really are Percy Alleline (Tinker), Bill Haydon (Tailor), Roy Bland (Soldier), and Toby Esterhase (could not catch his nickname). So who is the Mole? I will let Agent Spoiler tell you, it is.... Kidding! I will not let him commit that devilish cinematic crime. Director Tomas Alfredson does not construct an entertaining movie in 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy', but one that is very cerebral and converts you to Thinker by trying to grasp all of the details of the picture, and make sense of it in order to go along with Smileys' uncovering-spy mission. Peter Straughan and Bridget O'Connor's screenplay was one that is a head- scratcher but at the same time is also a head-catcher,whatever that means; actually, what that means is that it's confusing as hell but keeps you thinking about it. Sadly, O'Connor passed away last year before the film's release. Oldman was phenomenal in his Oscar-nominated performance as Smiley. There was high-intelligence acting work also from Toby Jones as Alleline, Colin Firth as Haydon, John Hurt as Control the retired head of British Intelligence, Mark Strong as agent Jim Prideaux, and Tom Hardy as cleaner Ricki Tarr. 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' is a thinking-man or thinking-woman's movie, and the mission to watch it should not be abandoned by anyone up to the challenge of capturing a complex flick. **** Good",8,0,2,25 December 2012
The Hateful Eight," Hateful great!
","There was not much to hate about Quentin Tarantino's latest chatty & blood filled cinematic offering 'The Hateful Eight'. The fact is that it's no Pulp Fiction, but 'The Hateful Eight' is still unchained with plenty of charismatic basterds and unreserved dogly humanoids. Before you want me to kill the bill of puns that I am firing and will continue to fire, please read along so I could provide you my cuento on Quentin's latest. Tarantino returns to the western genre; this time focusing on eight nefarious characters trapped in a Wyoming cabin under a profound blizzard. Kurt Russell plays bounty hunter John Ruth who is chainly transporting a female convict named Daisy Domergue to hang in Red Rock. On their way, they come across a Capital One card and look for Samuel L. Jackson in the vicinity; give me a break, there is lots of cerebral cortex pun dysfunction in my brainy wallet. Anyways, Ruth & Daisy do come across Samuel playing Mayor Marquis Warren who desperately needs transport so he does not die due to the storm. Moreover, on their transport another hateful hitches on for a ride and that would be Sheriff Chris Mannix played by the latest Quentin regular Walton Goggins. So the hateful quarter reach the cabin and inside are the the not-so-better-half of the hateful eight which consists of Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir), Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), and Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth). What they are doing in the cabin is something I won't reveal in order not to be a hateful spoiler. Tarantino again delivers with witty and enigmatic direction & screen writing. The entire cast shined but my favorite was Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue; hope all turns out daisy for Jennifer Jason Leigh on Oscar night as she has just been nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her exceptional performance. I will cease fire to my hateful puns and complete this review. But make sure your travels take you soon to 'The Hateful Eight'. You will love it! ***** Excellent",10,9,23,15 January 2016
The Adventures of Tintin," 'Tintin' is not in the top ten-ten of my favorite movies of the year, but I liked it!
","Steven Spielberg's first computer-animated movie 'The Adventures of Tintin' marks another gold cinematic star on this master's legendary directorial resume, and also signifies that there is no genre Steven cannot helm. The protagonist Tintin is voiced by Jamie Bell. Tintin is a young intrepid reporter always looking for an adventurous story. He sails on one when he buys a model ship called the Unicorn that includes a scroll that might be the key to a fortune. The problem is that the villainous Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) is hot on Tintin's tail to devour him of the Unicorn with its scroll. However, Tintin is no tonto; and with his magical dog Snowy there is no adventure Tintin can't handle. I love Tintin's cool, calm, and collective demeanor in facing even the most challenging of situations. Tintin teams up with Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis), whose ancestor was the Unicorn's first ship rider, in order to find the other model Unicorns with their treasured scrolls. Spielberg does incorporate the movie with some of his infamous storytelling themes and directorial techniques of his past iconic movies such as 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Catch Me If You Can', and even 'E.T.'; but in a more fast-paced family entertainment mode. Spielberg's team of screenwriters (Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish) verbally insert the movie with plenty of wit and exhilaration. And how can one not be impressed with the movie's 'true-to-almost-life' animation. The only knock I have against Tintin , like the movie business itself, is that there was a bit too much piracy in it; at times it seemed like a computer animated version of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At Tintin's End'. Nevertheless, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is tintinlating enough to garner a viewing adventure. **** Good",8,1,2,16 January 2012
Ocean's Twelve," The Twelve Days of Ocean was too merry for its own sake!
","OK, time to go back to the Ocean! 'Ocean's Twelve' is obviously the sequel to the caper hit 'Ocean's Eleven'. Did the sequel gamble payoff? Mmmmm well! I'll tell you this much! It did not hit the cinematic supreme jackpot that its predecessor was able to reach. At times 'Ocean's Twelve' seemed indolent, fatiguing, and unpolished. Hey, maybe the porn version of 'Ocean's Twelve' called 'The Dirty Dozen' will be better. OK, I lost track of this review. Coincidentally enough, at times you will lose track of 'Ocean's Twelve' unparalleled storyline. Director Steven Soderbergh could have 'soder' done a better job as he did in Eleven. In 'Ocean's Twelve', the same zany cast of characters are back for another heist before the clock strikes twelve. Maybe you've heard of them: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Don Cheadle, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, James Caan, and on and on and on. Andy Garcia is also back as the vengeful Casino Owner who wants his money back from the Oceanographers. To do that, the crew must execute a challenging European heist. Oh, who cares about the plot! You chicks just want to check out these dudes, while us guys have our dial set for 'Zeta 4' for the voluptuous Catherine Zeta-Jones who here plays a European detective who tries to be the heist ballbreaker. Again, it is Catherine's physical and not artistic presence that did it for me. Clooney and the rest of the gang seemed that they were having too much fun here and maybe did not take the project too seriously. It did cross my mind that maybe they had a little bit too much of those 'Ocean's Twelve' Packs. 'Ocean's Twelve' is still cool but not in the class of the groovy Eleven. *** Average",7,0,1,25 January 2005
Crash," Crash is head on to greatness!
","Director Paul Haggis' 'Crash' is a big cinematic hit! It is no accident that moviegoers and critics alike are voicing their positive opinions of 'Crash'. The film centers on several subplots of Los Angeleans during a 48-hour time span. The story lines eventually merge and collide with issues of jealousy, morality, benevolence, conflict, libel, corruption, and on the forefront: race. The characters that drive 'Crash' include: a district attorney & his domineering wife, a noble police officer & his Latin hottie partner/lover, a racist cop & his ethical rookie partner, a Puerto Rican locksmith & his devoted family, a successful African-American television director & his outspoken wife, a Hindu shop owner & his concerned family, and a couple of garrulous thugs. The performances by the actors which portray the aforementioned multicultural characters were bravura. This stellar 'crash unit' includes Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Terrence Dashon Howard, Brandon Fraser, and Jennifer Esposito. Dillon, Howard, and Newton should crash their way to supporting acting Oscar nominations. In fact, The Oscar red carpet should already be designed with a welcome 'Matt' for Dillon. It is the best performance of his restless and underrated acting career. Writer-Director Paul Haggis, who also scribed 'Million Dollar Baby', developed a powerful cerebral film in 'Crash'. His efforts should be commended during awards season for both direction & screen writing. Or better stated, I doubt that Haggis will have to crash most of the upcoming movie awards ceremonies. So get your 'rear-end' up and 'head-on' to collide with the cinematic brilliance of 'Crash'. ***** Excellent",10,6,13,4 November 2005
Pan's Labyrinth," Pantastical!
","Director Guillermo Del Toro's numinous, mesmerizing 'Pan's Labyrinth' is the foreign film feast of the year. Take a trip to this fantasyland where dreams can come true! I know! Shameless Disney plug! Anyway, enter to my 'Pun's Labyrinth' so I can guide you to the mastery of 'Pan's Labyrinth'. Child actress Ivana Baquero stars as Ofelia, the daughter of an ailing pregnant mother named Carmen. Ofelia's mom is married to Capitan Vidal, a malicious, ruthless Spanish leader who might be the supreme villain of the year in film. Ofelia is miserable in her existence until she inadvertently comes to the path of a magical labyrinth inhabited by a Pan. Mr. Panman leads her into a mystical journey that is filled with majesty and oddity that makes it the proper escape for the troubled child. Pan informs Ofelia that she was a princess that has been resurrected in her life-form. Pan also provides Ofelia the unearthly goods to cure her mother. However, Ofelia still has to persevere her cruel real world of being controlled by Captain Vidal. Let's just say that Captain Vidal's vicious demeanor makes Saddam Hussein look like_________ (sorry to keep you 'hanging' with the Saddam reference , remember you are in 'Meeza's Pun Labyrinth') Mother Teresa. I think Captain Vidal's daily liquid nutrition is primarily comprised of Captain Morgan juices. He massacres innocent peasants, assassinates his own Spaniards, beats his wife, and abuses children. That is the harsh 'verdad' on Vidal. Mercedes is Vidal's primary housekeeper which grows an affectionate bond with Ofelia. In the Labyrinth, Ofelia encounters supernatural experiences that have profound impacts in her natural existence. The ghoulish Labyrinth character that is a must-see of 'Pan's Labyrinth' is the Paleman! He has the 'white stuff'! He is creepy, whimsical, and visualize this: his eyeballs are on the palms of his hands. And by no means, don't mess with his fruit!!!!!!! You will see why when you un-vegetate yourself to see the film. The acting of 'Pan's Labyrinth' was nothing short of spectacular! Baquero was endearing as Ofelia. Adriana Gil's work was not ailing as mother Carmen. Maribel Verdu of 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' was convincing enough to demonstrate that she was caring enough to be 'la mama tambien' of Ofelia. Sergi Lopez was captivating in his work as the devilish Captain Vidal. Doug Jones was dually 'doug'-on great as Pan & The Pale Man. 'Pan's Labyrinth' cinematic labrytory was also embodied with excellence: Guillermo Navarro's cinematography, Jose Quetglas' makeup, Eugenio Caballero's art direction, and Javier Navarrete's musical score was phenomenal. However, it was Writer-Director Guillermo Del Toro's vision that was the catalyst of the brilliant success of 'Pan's Labyrinth'. This Del Toro is a visionary genius, and that is no bull about Del Toro! Make 'Pan's Labyrinth' your next stop in your cinematic journey! ***** Excellent",9,1,3,27 January 2007
Horrible Bosses," You be the boss, but I thought it was pretty good, though not great.
","The supervisor revenge comedy 'Horrible Bosses' is not horrible, not terrible, definitely tolerable, but not incredible. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis star as employee slaves to controlling bosses who decide to take the 'last resort' highway in seeking vengeance to their higher ups by scheming to murder them. Bateman plays Dale Arbus, an overworked office employee who is constantly scrutinized by his hardball boss Dave Harken. Sudeikis portrays Kurt Buckman, a man who works for the bucks in a family owned chemical company who's controlled by the egocentric cokehead Bobby Pellitt after Pellitt's admirable father passes away from a heart attack, and therefore making Buckman's worklife a living nightmare. And the day has come (or at least the time) to tell you that Day spent his days on 'Horrible Bosses' playing dental assistant Dale Arbus, he who is sexually harassed by a voluptuous female dentist boss Dr. Julia Harris; who is portrayed by a very sexy Jennifer Aniston. I think the last one is not so horrible and that is no muela, but it is for Dale since he is recently engaged and had always wanted to be a 'husband' when he grew up. The Three Amigos put their liquid assets together so they can liquidate their Three Jefes. However, they are not exactly The Big Three Killing Machine, more like The Three Stooges. So therefore, they try to contract a hit-man to do the dirty deed. Things do not go exactly according to plan on that, so they end up contracting 'murder consultant' Dean 'MF' Jones. Director Seth Gordon commands 'Horrible Bosses' with lots of slapstick comedy which at times raises the comedy of the film, but at others it downsizes its narrative. I prefer the subtle comedy Gordon inserts in the film and I rather promote that aspect of the movie. Screenwriters Michael Markowitz and John Francis Daley should have been more closely supervised by their boss Gordon, because their screenplay needed some polish even though it did have enough comedic turns to be it classified as a moderate success, so good (not great) job goes out to Michael and John. Our three leading actors Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis were solid with their performances but not ready to promote them as the exemplary comedic performances of 2011. However, their evil thespian counterparts were bad to the bone! Kevin Spacey was vintage villainous Kevin Spacey as the profoundly horrible Harken. Colin Farrell was the scene-stealer of all the thespian employees of 'Horrible Bosses' with his spectacular work as the despicable Pellitt; I am just Pellitting as it is. And my friends, I guarantee you have never seen this side of Jennifer Aniston with her hands-on deadpan performance as the Sexual Dentist the Menace Dr. Harris. Jamie Foxx was also a bad M.F. and a sure hit with his work as Dean 'M.F' Jones; just wanted to see more of it. Overall, this movie is not in the company of superb workplace comedies as 'Office Space', but then again you will not spend horrible losses of time by clocking in to 'Horrible Bosses'. **** Good",8,1,3,9 July 2011
Black Mass," Masterpiece!
","James 'Whitey' Bulger, the kingpin leader of the 'Winter Hill' gang, was a notorious criminal from South Boston responsible for many deaths. He was a fugitive for many years until he was found and arrested in Santa Monica, California in 2011. Bulger was as vulgar as a criminal could get. Bulger was also an FBI informant revealing info on mafia organizations in North Boston, but that didn't stop Bulger from orchestrating his own mass killings. Director Scott Cooper has organized a crime film on the story of Bulger's violent ways in South Boston called 'Black Mass'. The film was a surefire hit with me, and I thought Cooper did a sensational job in orchestrating it. Johnny Depp's performance as Bulger was the best of his career, and you could 'depp' on it that it will garner him a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Joel Edgerton was also on his game as FBI Agent John Connolly who protected Whitey for selfish career purposes. Peter Sarsgaard provides a scene-stealing performance as a drug-dealer paranoid that Bulger will assassinate him. Benedict Cumberbatch did a nice job imitating a Massachusetts Senator who also happens to be Whitey's brother, ouch! Mark Malluok and and Jez Butterworth's screenplay of the picture was worthy and on its mark with its authentic narrative on the crime world of South Boston and of course Bulger's rise & fall. However, in all, it was Depp who was the biggest hit of the movie, and Johnny being bad was very very good. So witness it for yourself and then tell the masses about 'Black Mass'. ***** Excellent",10,1,4,25 November 2015
Nacho Libre," Naachso are a bit salty but does have a comedic taste
","I guess the effervescent Jack Black was the prototypical actor to play the ludicrous Lucha Libre wrestler 'Nacho Libre'. Director Jared Hess, who helmed the modern cult classic 'Napoleon Dynamite', made the right choice in casting Black. No one could play Nacho better. Black is definitely a 'Nacho, Nacho Man' 'he had to be the Nachoman.' However, I guess what Hess needed was bit more of that cerebral creative gas to pump up his Nacho movie. The film is too inconsistently entertaining. At times it is a wallop of a laugh-fest while at others it wrestles itself to lie flat on the floor. 'Nacho Libre' follows a monk named Nacho who desperately wants to provide funding for the orphans he cares for in the monastery. He decides to transform himself into the bubbling alter-ego Nacho with a bubbling emaciated wresting partner named Esqueleto. Nacho also decided to dip into the Nacho physique to impress the beautiful nun, Sister Encarnacion. One thing is for sure, Nacho shows way too much carne to impress Encarnacion. Make no bones about it that Hector Jimenez as Esqueleto is one of the comedic acting charms of the year. It is very reminiscent of another Mexican actor in a Hess film. Of course, I am referring to the performance that made our wildest dreams come true, Efren Ramirez as Pedro in 'Napoleon Dynamite'. Well, that is the skinny on Jimenez's efforts. 'Nacho Libre' is not worth jumping for joy for, but it worthy to greet it with a welcome mat. *** Average",7,0,0,5 September 2006
The Town," Affleeeeeeck insures 'The Town'!
","The talk of the town is that Ben Affleck's 'The Town' will be a legitimate power player during this year's movie awards season. After visiting 'The Town', I could see why. Big Ben has proved one more time that he can pass for a legitimate movie director with another triumphant directorial effort in his sophomoric try behind the lens. His directorial debut was the very good 'Gone Baby Gone'. The narrative of 'The Town' resides in the blue-collar town of Charlestown; a suburb of Boston where bank robberies are of Boston Common. Affleck stars as Doug Macray, the bank robber leader of a gang of four thieves who habitually steal away in the heart of Charlestown; and you can take that to the bank! Jeremy Renner co-stars as Macray's right-hand hot-tempered robbery man James Coughlin, who will take prisoners and do whatever it takes for his victims to cough up the cashola. Jon Hamm is sandwiched here as FBI Special Agent Adam Frawley, a mad man whose relentless pursuit of Macray and Co. takes center stage several times in 'The Town'. Rebecca Hall is the hall female monitor (whatever that means) in this one portraying Claire Keesey, a bank hostage victim of Macray who falls in love with him; being unaware that it was a Bad Doug that held her hostage during a bank heist. Pete Postlethwaite is Fergie Colm, a malicious Charlestown criminal kingpin who 'not Colmy' barks the orders to Macray and his crew for their bank robbery gigs. In other words, I have a feeling its not going to be a good night when this Fergie is around. Yep, the gossip is true, Blake Lively co-stars as Krista Coughlin, Dougie's sleazy ex-girlfriend who is also James' sister. But in reality, the main character of 'The Town' is Boston. Affleck is uplifted by the profound love of his hometown and Bentown, I mean Beantown, becomes the centerpiece to the revolving narrative of the movie. Affleck's directorial skills in 'The Town' are potent, enthralling, and unpretentious. He is deserving of a Best Director Academy Award nomination for painting 'The Town' red with some stirring action-packed sequences, and undoubtedly for the story's character interplay. Credit also goes to Ben and co-writer Peter Craig for scripting 'The Town' with its words. All the aforementioned performances are worthy of Oscar nominations. But I was primarily taken back by Lively's lively emotional punch as Krista, Renner's stellar work as brother James, and Pistol Pete Postlethwaite himself for his brawny performance as the despicable Fergie (that's a first, 'despicable' and 'Fergie' in the same sentence). I was also down with The Town's musical score, art direction, and most of all for Robert Elswit's astounding cinematography; the witty Elswit should garner a Best Cinematography Academy Award nomination come Oscar time. So I think it's about time you hit the town and cinematically reside in 'The Town' for a couple of hours, Big Ben will make sure its worth your time! ***** Excellent",9,1,5,7 October 2010
Closer," Close to Perfection!
","There is no doubt in my medulla oblongata that one cannot close their eyes when they observe the vigor & barbarity of Mike Nichols' 'Closer'. The film stars Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman as four impassioned human species who have 'closer encounters of the swapping kind'. Disclaimer: this is not a romantic comedy! Not even close! The film focuses on the verbal savagism lovers can say to one another. In more simplistic terms: it is not sometimes the lies that we do want to hear, but is the truths we do not want to hear. This Nichols' film reminds me much of his sexually orientated classic 'Carnal Knowledge'. I guess mike got back into his carnivorous ways and brought us back some 'carne con bollo'. Unfortunately in 'Closer', Director Mike did not show us Julia & Natalie's aforementioned body part. 'Closer' was written by Patrick Marber, who also scripted the play that is based on. Do you know the name of it? Yes, you are close! It's also called 'Closer'! Marber did a 'marberlous' job in adapting his own play with a calenture-type dialogue. Roberts & Law were grand as Dan & Anna. But I must say that as close as 'Closer' gets to acting supremacy does not come from our superstars Jude & Julia. That illustrious honor would go to the robust works of Owen & Portman as Larry & Alice. Natalie was an 'Alice in Acting Wonderland' and Clive's Larry was one of the most stalwart movie pervs of all-time. Owen's acting was a masterpiece of pervection, I mean perfection. 'Closer' does carry a few unnecessary elements into the film, but it is a realistic film that can reflect your life in ways that are closer than you think. **** Good",8,1,1,25 January 2005
Elf," Elf provides gigantic laughs!
","'Elf' is a movie about a big guy in a green suit that made some big green and made other filmmakers green with envy. Speaking of 'Made', 'Elf' was directed by Jon Favreau; the star & director of 'Made' and star & writer of 'Swingers'. With the blockbuster status of 'Elf', Favs is evolving into one of the superlative comedic directors of our generation. The star of 'Elf' is not doing too shabby himself. And why not! He is probably the funniest entertainer working in show business. I am not 'toying' with you! Of course, I am referring to Will Ferrell. His performance as Buddy, the lanky nitwit raised by elves who is now on a quest to find & bond with his biological father, was the paramount laugh riot work of 2003. It had me in stitches! (This way the elves could put me back together.) Another impressive showstopper was Zooey Deschanel as Jovie, the toy store employee who becomes Buddy's fem buddy. Deschanel is an actress on the up-rise who is definitely not on the bad acting 'naughty list'; even though this hot blonde could be naughty to me anytime. 'Elf' also contains the best comedy scene of 2003; the corporate meeting scene when Buddy mistakes a surly publication executive giant (wonderfully played by dwarf actor Peter Dinklage) for an elf is honest to say as absolute comedic mastery. 'Elf' is 'boy toy' heaven at its best; I hope that was not taken in a certain context. ***** Excellent",9,1,4,30 January 2005
Shutter Island," Shut up! Shutter Island rules!
","Welcome to my Punner Island where all your pun dreams can come true! Of course I am going to punhabit my review of Director Martin Scorsese's brilliant 'Shutter Island' as I do to all of my reviews. 'Shutter Island' is not associated with the documentary based on every time that Paris Hilton opens her mouth, that one is called 'Shut-her Island'. OK, I will focus on 'Shutter Island' before you guys think I belong on 'Shut-him Island'. Leonardo Dicaprio, collaborating with Scorsese for the fourth time, stars as Teddy Daniels; a 1950's U.S. Marshall who travels to Shutter Island to investigate a case of a missing patient. The island is primarily comprised of a hospital for the criminally insane. Sounds crazy ha? OK, sorry. Moving right along¬Ö Teddy's marshall partner is Chuck, played by the reliable Mark Ruffalo. Teddy was a soldier in World War II and played a big part in rescuing Holocaust victims in a Nazi concentration camp. He is a recent widower whose wife accidental death still haunts him as he keeps having hallucinations of her. In the hospital for the criminally insane, they are met by numerous peculiar characters who do not help Teddy & Chuck much with the investigation; and I am not primarily referring to the patients also. I really cannot indulge more in providing you plot lines of 'Shutter Island' because that would have me institutionalized in the hospital for the spoilerly insane, they have that? It is not insane to state that Leonardo DiCaprio's masterful performance should garner him another Best Actor Oscar nomination. The supporting performances of the film were also sanely proficient. Besides Ruffalo's fine work, I was psyched with the stellar performances of legendary actors Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the hospital's primary psychiatrists, Kingsley playing the head mental honcho. The up-and-coming Emily Mortimer and the always stupendous Patricia Clarkson were scene-stealing in their brief performances as a couple of zany Rachel patients. Michelle Williams was not spectacular in her work as Teddy's deceased wife Dolores, but I would not say she was 'dead in the water' also with her moderately commending performance. Kudos also goes out to veteran character actors John Carroll Lynch and Jackie Earle Haley for their powerful supporting work; Lynch playing a head guard and Haley playing a loony patient held at the hospital's 'critical psyche condition' ward. The film's cinematography and art direction were vivid enough to also be called as Oscar nominees at next year's show. Laeta Kalogridis' twisting screenplay based on Dennis Lehane's novel made me 'twist & shout' with literary pleasure. But who is crazy and daring enough to put all of this together- the one and only highbrow eyebrow maestro, Mr. Martin Scorsese. His daring direction of 'Shutter Island' does not depart from the fact that Scorsese is still at the top of his game. So take that surreal cinematic voyage to the bizarre but worthwhile 'Shutter Island'. ***** Excellent",9,3,7,10 April 2010
Capote," Phil fils up the screen with Capote!
","Phillip Seymour Hoffman was astonishing as legendary writer Truman Capote in the bio film 'Capote'. It is an Oscar-caliber performance that has been acclaimed by numerous critics as the unsurpassed acting of the year. Truman Capote was quirky, garrulous, self-centered, liquorish, gay, and extroverted. Hoffman was not 'off man' in portraying those aforementioned cluster of characteristics in the Capote character. I am delighted that more filmgoers will now 'Seymour' I mean 'see more' of Hoffman's work. He has been one of the most undervalued actors for some time now. His acting forte is to play sad sack losers. However, Hoffman is a winner and might very will be one come Oscar night. Truman Capote was the 'Truman Show' and center of attention of many New York cocktail galas and parties. His exuberant personality was more of a fa√ßade and defense mechanism for his sadistic self-esteem. The film for the most part solely fixates on the developments of his classic novel 'In Cold Blood'. The libro told the bloody tale of a mid-western family who were violently murdered in (you got it!) cold blood by two psychotic killers. Capote actually befriended the psychopaths to aid him with the non-fiction narrative. The supporting cast of 'Capote' was also bloody good: Catherine Keener as his confidante Harper Lee, Chris Cooper as the local lawman Alvin Dewey, Bruce Greenwood as Truman's lover Jack Dunphy, and Clifton Collins Jr. as slayer Perry Smith. However, this was Hoffman's show! Director Bennett Miller and Writer Dan Futterman are the true men who meticulously developed a bloody potent film. This 'Capote' should not to be 'caput'.

Life of Pi," Hungry for Pi? You should be!
","The Angular tales are back with another Ang Lee feature. Director Lee is never timid in taking on a wide array of genres when tackling on a movie. And in his latest 'Life of Pi' he might have just discovered a new genre for motion pictures because Pi serves such themes as adventure, love, courage, man vs. beast, family, religion, regret, friendship, survival, and a few others all in one just movie. 'Life of Pi' is the most beautiful looking picture of the year, and it will have its Pi I mean eye on the Oscar prize of many technical categories including Best cinematography, sound effects, editing, special effects, and art direction. By the way, the 3-D in this picture is used to its apex. The movie features our protagonist Pi Patel first as an adult telling his incredible teen tale to a journalist, and then it rewinds to flashback in the telling of his unforgettable adventure at sea. Pi's real name is Piscine, so you could imagine how much he was bullied at school due to his name. His father named him Piscine because of his love of pools; but come on bro, out of all the pool of names you could have named your son, why that one? To avoid future name harassment, Pi during his teens, decided to shorten out his name to Pi; an incredible scene in the movie shows Pi in a 3.14 craze demonstrating to his classmates how the Pi equation is calculated in order for them to comprehend that he is now a Pi not a Piscine. Pi's parents live in India and own a farm. When economic problems arise, Pi's father decides to move teen Pi and the family from India to Canada. His plan is to sell the farm (literally) in Canada. To do this, he must first take the family and the animals on a freight ship at sea to Canada. And that is when 'Life of Pi' transposes itself to a mystical 'survival-at-sea' flick. A brutal storm causes a shipwreck which Pi bravely survives. Consequently, he is stranded on a lifeboat with an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena, and a Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. Yea, that happened to me also. Anyways, Director Lee carries the picture into a thrilling state of 'young man vs. beast' for survival. And he brilliantly depicts the relationship between Pi and Richard Parker as the forefront on many of the film's messages about the aforementioned themes. Wait, I must take a break. My cat Douglas Simpson is hungry and I must feed him. OK, that's enough. David Magee's endearing screenplay also deserves an Oscar nod for its relative verbose within Lee's direction. And Ang is a shoe-in for a Best Director Oscar nomination, I must say. Another what should be a sure Oscar nomination is Newcomer Suri Sharma's mesmeric performance as the teen Pi. And Surily I can be serious! Veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan was solid as the adult Pi, but the young Pi Sharma had the more tasty scenes for a thespian showcase. So without a doubt, on a scale from 1 to 4 (4 being excellent), 'Life of Pi' is not a 4 but much better than a 3.14. ***** Excellent",10,19,36,25 November 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Thirteen is lucky here!
","To develop another sequel to the Ocean franchise was not much of a gamble. '11' hit it big at the box office so the films producers decided to double-down on 11 and produce a continuing '12' which brought more than a dozen of glories to the Ocean franchise even though '12' was not admired by critics. So now the waves are high on the expectations of 'Ocean's Thirteen'! Will 'Ocean's Thirteen' crash at the box office or will it be smooth financial sailing again? The film almost made $40 mil at the box office during its opening weekend run so I would say that this Specific Ocean is banking it in again. 'Ocean's Thirteen' returns to Las Vegas and like '11' it focuses on an elaborate casino burglary scheme against a supercilious Las Vegas hotel entrepreneur. This time is Willy Banks played by Al Pacino. All the Ocean players are back to steal your heart with their witty banter and distinctive specializations. In case you forgot, the Ocean crew includes: The leader of this safecrack pack himself Danny Ocean (George Clooney), the slick Rusty (Brad Pitt), the 'wanting to prove' Linus (Matt Damon), the Vegas hotel historian Reuben (Elliot Gould), the nervy Livingston (Eddie Jemison), the explosive Basher (Don Cheadle), the acrobatic shortie Yen (Shaobo Qin), the bickering brothers Virgil (Casey Affleck) & Turk (Scott Caan), the Croupier smoothie Frank (Bernie Mac), and the conning elder Saul (Carl Reiner). OK, so that is just 11! Who are the other two? The hotel villain of '11' Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) yes you heard right; and a techy wizard Roman (Eddie Izzard). Banks right-hand-woman Abigail played by Ellen Barkin is the sole female primary character in this Ocean tale. The ensemble acting is not much of an audacious effort by these thespian clowns, but it is still a supreme spectacle of movie stars having a ball on-the-job and doing it formidably & coolly. I do have a slight favoritism towards Elliot Gould taking the acting gold of this crew for his comical work as Reuben. Pacino banked it in also for yet another grand performance as a baddie in playing Banks. I cannot tell you more specifics of 'Ocean's Thirteen' because that would be Movie Spoilery! And even the Ocean's Crew do not commit that one! What I can tell you is that 'Ocean's Thirteen' is on a revenge heist against Banks who cheated Ruben out of millions on a hotel deal. Director Steven Soderbergh does recapture some of that cool aura and clever dialogue that brought 'Ocean's Eleven' a critic goldmine. However, my money is still on 'Ocean's Eleven' as the king of the trilogy! Nevertheless, you should still check out that Oceanview of 'Ocean's Thirteen'. **** Good",8,1,4,14 June 2007
Lost in Translation," Lose Yourself In Movie Heaven!
","Turning Japanese, I think I am turning Japanese, I really think so; or at least turning to the resplendent & outlandish Sofia Coppola Tokyo world of 'Lost in Translation'. Director Coppola's masterpiece piece will receive great fortune cookies, I mean fortunes, come this award season. Bill Murray stars as Bob Harris, an aging American actor who travels to Japan to endorse a whiskey. This whiskey business is very lucrative for Bob not to pass up even though he must travel zillions of miles to appear in tv commercials & print ads in promoting the liquor. Scarlett Johansson co-stars as the beautiful Charlotte, a newlywed who accompanies her photographer husband on a business trip. 'Lost in Translation' fixates on Bob & Charlotte's relationship in glorious, but yet, isolated Tokyo. They are lonely souls finding compatibility in an incompatible society. The upper echelon scenes of 'Lost in Translation' are set in a hotel cocktail lounge & a karaoke watering hole. Murray's karaoke rendition of Roxy Music's 'More Than This' is remarkable, and more than I expected. Young Coppola's chic direction glamorizes not only the city of Tokyo but also our 2 solitary protagonists. Sofia, daughter of legendary Director Francis Ford Coppola, is clearly on her way in being hailed as the 'godmother of young female directors'. I am sure that she will be offered remunerative monetary projects that she won't refuse. Scarlett Johansson was near perfect as Charlotte. Hopefully, her dexterous work will not be forgotten and be 'gone like the wind' during award season. Frankly my dear Scarlett, I will give a damn if you are not recognized. 'What about Bob?' You ask. Simply stated, Bill Murray as Bob delivers the best performance of his celebrated career. 'Lost in Translation' es una de las peores peliculas de esta temporada. Hey! What happened? I really meant to say that 'Lost in Translation' is one of the best films of the season. I guess I got a bit 'lost in translation' myself. So lose yourself with 'Lost In Translation'. ***** Excellent",10,0,0,15 October 2003
Interstellar," Yea, I understood it all! NOOOOT! But who cares, still amazing!
","Where can I start instilling my praise for Christopher Nolan's mesmerizing film 'Interstellar'? There is lots to love about 'Interstellar',but keep in mind it's a Nolan film, so there's lots to learn with 'Interstellar' by viewing it repeatedly and getting a degree in Astrophysics. OK, I was a bit far out there, but again it's a Nolan film so there are plenty of 'come again?' moments even if your intelligence if plenty above ground. The movie stars Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a widowed father of two, who resides in a future where the crop is dying, and the world is in danger of extinction. Cooper, a pilot and a farmer himself, gets fatefully transported to a secret organization who at that time many thought no longer existed; we call them today NASA. Cooper is asked to go on a mission with space astronaut comrades to find another planet that can inhibit life so the people on earth don't have to face their impending doom on the endangered planet earth. Cooper has a wily 10 year-old daughter named Murph and a devoted teenage son named Tom. Murph is the one that is fully against her dad going on this longtime mission, an age part of the mission is that Coop stays the same age while the earthlings get older; beats Oil of Olay any day I guess! The mission is filled with complexities, deceit, discoveries, and challenges; and they even go and Save Private Ryan; OK, I am stopping there. Will Cooper ever see Murph and Tom again? Well, I am not not going to be an interspoiler by revealing that. Nolan proved once again that he is a master auteur with his direction of 'Interstellar'; but what I was enamored more about his orchestration of the film that he made the picture more as a love & bond story between a father and a daughter through the test of time (and this is big time) and their brawny magnetic force. The technical features of the movie were exemplary including its cinematography, production design, sound, and of course its extra special visual effects. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's screenplay was sure complex but very heartwarming, And yes, there was a a bit of a drag in the film's second act, but it all rightfully led to an astonishing third act. McConaughey continues his alright, alright, alright acting with his superb performance as Cooper. Anne Hathaway was outstanding as the fellow physicist astronaut Dr. Amelia Brand; and there was another brand that rated high, and that was the performance of Michael Caine as Amelia's father, Professor Brand who orchestrated the mission. The enchanting Jessica Chastain yet delivered another potent performance as the adult Murph. Other fine supporting work was lifted off by Wes Bentley as fellow astronaut Doyle, David Gyasi as the Black Hole expert Romilly, and child actress MacKenzie Joy as a young Murph. So if you have not done so already, now it's the time to set your cinematic mission set to the stellar 'Interstellar'. ***** Excellent",9,0,5,3 August 2015
American Sniper," Right on!
","'American Sniper' sure hits with surefire accuracy in many cinematic categories. Clint Eastwood's picture depicts the story of real life NAVY Seals Sniper Chris Kyle; Eastwood does deliver the good, the bad, and the ugly about patriotic duty and gritty warfare in the movie. Kyle was called the 'legend', as Eastwood himself is and Clint has directed another solid offering in the twilight of his career. Now, 'American Sniper' is not a a perfect movie; Jason Hall's academy award nominated screenplay was a bit overrated and it did have its sporadic misses with one too many formulaic lines in a war picture. Bradley Cooper was mesmerizing as Kyle and is worthy of his Best Actor Oscar nomination. Sienna Miller showed yet again this year that it's 'Miller' time with her impressive work as Kyle's wife Taya; Sienna fit the right 'taya' for her role. So your tour of duty in the next few days is to target on to 'American Sniper'. **** Good",8,54,107,17 January 2015

Lion," Not a Lion King of a picture but close...
","There has been a vast amount of roar about the touching drama 'Lion', and now I know why it roared with critics. 'Lion' features the true story of Saroo Brierly, a five-year old Indian boy who gets lost in the streets of an Indian city very far from home. Via events that followed, Saroo gets adopted by an Australian couple John and Sue Brierly. Twenty years later, Saroo decides to come down to Google Earth to help locate his original mother and brother in India. Director Garth Davis provides an authentic emotional landscape that viably transports you into Saroo's incredible story. Luke Davies' screenplay also feeds the 'Lion' with a genuine verbal touch. Dev Patel was no thespian slumdog with his credible performance as the adult Saroo; Sunny Pawar also provided a little sunshine with his loving performance as the child Saroo. Nicole Kidman's work as Sue Brierly was solid, but not of Oscar caliber; but who am I to believe, I'm just a corny pun kidman. Rooney Mara did not add anything relevant to the picture as Saroo's girlfriend Lucy; so yea, I did not Love the Lucy character here. Nevertheless, I am not lying when I say to feed this cinematic 'Lion'. **** Good",8,0,1,29 January 2017
Southpaw," Split Decision on 'Southpaw', a moderate winner but not the undisputed boxing movie of the year
","I am about to give you a round & round pun review of Director Antoine Fuqua's boxing movie 'Southpaw'. So if you are a lightweight when it comes to pun corniness, I suggest you to throw in the towel and stop reading now. Aaaanywways, 'Southpaw' stars Jake Gyllenhaal as light heavyweight boxing champion Billy Hope. At the film's onset, he is pretty much past being the great white hope; he is the champion of the world, he has a gorgeous wife, has a kind & loving daughter, and is filthy rich. But Fuqua then turns the movie into a 'riches to rags' story when tragedy strikes; and I am not going to hit you now with a spoiler because it was in all the film's trailers, his wife is killed. Hope then loses all hope of both the boxing world and the living world and spirals into darkness. The rest of the film focuses on Hope trying to get hope again to return to glory. The movie did have its inspiring moments but I was not left hooked or even right hooked with the movie's mundane & rather predictable narrative & screenplay. Now I am not going to say that Fuqua 'fuquaed up' because he did an admirable job in directing the boxing scenes, but his Screenwriter Kurt Fuller did not fill the movie with any enticing dialogue. Gyllenhaal does go 'punch to punch' with a knockout performance as Hope. Rachel McAdams gets a minor spotlight as his wife Maureen, but does it admirably. However, I could not say the same for Forest Whitaker's stale performance as boxing gym owner and trainer Tick Willis; his performance did tick me off at times. Listen, I am not saying that 'Southpaw' should be left out of your 'movies to see' list, but temper your expectations below the 'Creed'. *** Average",7,0,0,15 May 2016
21 Jump Street," There are more than 21 reasons why you should check this one out!
","Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! I sound a bit Kris Krossed there or Van Halenish, take your pick. I just wanted to jump in quickly to my review of the hilarious comedy '21 Jump Street'. The film is based on the popular 80's TV show. Like the show, the film focuses on a couple of young police officers who go undercover in a high school to investigate crimes, more of the drug dealing affair. Channing Tatum stars as young Officer Jenko, who is the muscular good-looking type but not too bright in the cerebral bulb. Jenko (the J is not silent) was a bully during high school. Jonah Hill co-stars as young Officer Schmidt, who is the vertically challenged officer who is gifted with mental aptitude but lacking in the physical component. Schmidt was one of Jenko's main bully targets in high school. So jump few years later, and what we see is that Jenko & Schmidt reunite now as young officers and even partner up together; but this time around in a more friendly tone, even though they do have their disagreements. Schmidt and Jenko's undercover high school mission is to find the supplier of a dangerous synthetic drug that is being circulated and sold in the school to many students. But due to their inadequacies, Schmidt and Jenko do get in a bit of uproarious situations in trying to complete their mission, which in hence becomes nearly a 'Mission Impossible'; had to plug in another movie that was adapted from a popular TV show. Speaking of missions, Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have successfully completed the mission that many filmmakers have not been able to succeed in, which is adapting an infamous TV show into a great film. Michael Bacall's screenplay was side-splitting and engaging. Channing Tatum demonstrated that he could bare his stuff also for the comedic genre with his humorous performance as Jenko. And it is 'No Schmidt' that Jonah Hill is quite the talent, with yet another strong performance here as Schmidt. Other '21 Jump Street' notable acting performances that were on target included Ice Cube as the fiery Police Captain Dickson, Rob Riggle as the oddball P.E. Coach Mr. Walters , and some guy that had the '21 Jump Street' gig before who should remain nameless so I do not commit the horrific cinematic crime of movie spoiling. '21 Jump Street' is a very funny movie that you should investigate as soon as possible. ***** Excellent",9,6,12,20 January 2013
Bridget Jones's Diary," It Will Make Your Day!
","Monday May 283:35 p.m.- I arrive at the Sunset Place Cinema. I make the usual `disney world space mountain' type line to purchase tickets. Finally, I buy movie tickets (using my 1994 student i.d.)  for the new british romantic-comedy `Bridget Jones's Diary.' Since I am a big fan of british comedies such as `Four Weddings and a Funeral' and `Notting Hill', I did have high expectations.4:40 p.m.- I sit down in the multiplex and start shouting all the answers to the movie trivia questions that are shown on the large screen before the previews start. Yes, I know my mind has an endless capacity for useless information!! 4:53 p.m.- I view some previews to some upcoming summer films such as `Planet of the Apes' (which is the story of some of the girls that I have met when I have been really drunk and realize the morning after that the truth hurts) and `Legally Blonde'  (which is the story of some of the girls that have gone with me to watch the submarine races at a nearby beach).
5:05 p.m.- I start watching a quite amusing little gem of a film in `Bridget Jones's Diary.' I first notice that Renee Zellweger was born to play this part; even though many critics felt that she would be unable to play the part british. Renee's british accent and acting was excellent.  
6:10 p.m.- I get a good feel about what the plot of the film is all about: a distress chain-smoking social-drinker chunky british single female determined to fight the right man, lose weight, and change her drinking and smoking habits by year's end.6: 40 p.m.- I get up to go to the bathroom to do #1. Yes I know! That is T.M.I. (too much information). Anyways, at this point I do realize that the movie had made me laugh from time to time. I also realize that Hugh Grant and Colin Firth also deliver some very effective performances as the men in Bridget Jones' life. Screenwriter Richard Curtis again proves why his writing always deserves curtain calls. 7:00 p.m.- The movie ends. I was quite satisfied with `Bridget Jones's Diary', even though it is not in the same line of cinematic excellence as `Four Weddings' and `Notting Hill'. 11:00 p.m.- I write this review for `Bridget Jones's Diary' and recommend to all moviegoers that this film has the `write' stuff!**** Good",8,0,0,29 May 2001
American Hustle," Hustling at its apex!! No lie!
","What a horrific movie this is! Yuk!!! Get away from this monstrosity of a picture! Kidding! Just conning you because everyday I'm hustling LMFAO!!! I am no pun hustler, well maybe a little, but one thing I know that is real is that 'American Hustle' is one of the best if not the best movie of 2013. Director David O. Russell strikes gold again with another impressive playbook in orchestrating a motion picture. 'American Hustle' stars a top-of-his-game Christian Bale as Irving Rosenfeld, a lifelong New York con artist who teams up with the beautiful Sydney Prosser to con desperate men asking for loans. Amy Adams plays Prosser with exact precision. Not to mention, Amy has never looked better in a movie; Will Larry Flynt be calling Amy for a Hustler cover? Who knows? But she is better than that. Anyways, when Irving and Sydney get busted by FBI Agent Richie DiMaso (masterfully played by Bradley Cooper), the con game goes into a governmental level. DiMaso uses Irving and Sydney to seize elected officials in taking bribes; this was all based on the real life Abscam scandal of the late 70's. The movie is set in the 70's and it is presented also as a love letter to that 'won't play by the rules' decade, and that is the way uh-huh uh-huh I like it. Jennifer Lawrence also is on target here as Irving's showy wife Rosalyn. Jeremy Renner contributed a major Mayor performance as the targeted Mayor Carmine Polito. The entire acting ensemble of 'American Hustle' was spectacular, but my favorite performance of the movie was of Cooper's as DiMaso. David O. Russell co-wrote the screenplay with Eric Singer, and what a money script it was. Sure Mr. Russell did incorporate a few Scorseseisms in his direction and writing of 'American Hustle', but he did inject his own Russell muscle to it also. This movie should garner a plethora of Oscar nominations for Acting, Screenplay, and Direction among many other categories; and if it doesn't, there has to be some type of con going on in the Academy. So get on your Con-Air vehicle to witness the cinematic brilliance of 'American Hustle'. In other words, do the hustle!!!! ***** Excellent",10,48,91,27 December 2013

But it was Daniel Bruhl that won this acting race by putting it up in Oscar-worthy gear with his winning performance as Lauda. Howard geared the film with precise precision in his direction.

Nightcrawler," Jake G. excels in playing another Darko character!
","Night Crawler, Night Crawler, Jake knows how to do it. OK, sorry for the very Saturday night feverish intro in my film review of Writer- Director Dan Gilroy's 'Nightcrawler'. The movie stars the aforementioned Jake, as in Gyllenhaal, as the mentally disturbed and obsessed Louis Bloom. Louie Louie is unemployed and looking for work until he stumbles into a roadside accident and notices independent freelance videographers who shoot tape of nocturnal news events and sell them to the local television stations; otherwise known as nightcrawling. Bloom then blooms into a more disturbed individual when he runs with this concept and decides to become a nightcrawler himself. Gilroy shoots 'Nightcrawler' with a subjective eye prioritizing on Bloom's narcissistic demeanor. Gyllenhaal does some of his finest work in his career as Bloom. Other eye-catching performances were derived from Rene Russo playing a sensationalistic-seeking TV news director, and Riz Ahmed playing Louis' gullible nightcrawling assistant.

The Aviator," Aviator Glides with near Greatness
","Can legendary Director Martin Scorsese 'score' his long-awaited Best Director Oscar with his Howard Hughes bio 'The Aviator'? Most oddsmakers feel Marty will be sipping a few 'martynis' after he receives his first golden boy at this year's Academy Awards. However, Scorsese has been the favorite before and left home empty-handed. For example: 1) The 'Taxi Driver' oversight many felt was not 'fare' 2) Many also felt that Academy voters were 'Bad Fellas' for not awarding Marty the statuette for 'Good Fellas' 3) Even others felt that the 2003 Academy Awards should have been renamed 'The Gong Show' for not recognizing Scorsese for his 'Gang Show' that is 'Gangs of New York'. However, I do think Scorsese will reach new Oscar heights for his spectacular & mesmerizing direction of 'The Aviator'. The bio film focuses on the legendary billionaire, aviator mogul, and Hollywood big wig that was Howard Hughes. 'The Aviator' takes off with Hughes' relentless direction of 'Hell's Angels' and ends with the Pan Am/TWA Senate Hearings. During its airtime, 'The Aviator' exhibits: Hughes romances with Hollywood starlets, his aircraft obsessions, and speaking of obsessions: his obsessive compulsive disorders. Leonardo Dicaprio's performance as Howard Hughes was definitely worth a billion bucks. He portrayed Hughes as capricious, obsessive (of course), enterprising, focused, rigid, suave, and strenuous. Leo's work is one of the best of the year! Pero que 'Leo' se va forma si no lo nominan para un Oscar. Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Katherine Hepburn, one of Hughes' Hollywood conquests, was hypnotic. Blanchett's 'vowelistic' vocal interpretation of Hepburn's infamous gab was definitely something to 'vowel, I mean, bow down to'. Hughes romanced Hepburn before she hooked up with Spencer Tracy. I guess the billionairo proved that he can 'have his Kate and eat it too'. Speaking of Hollywood starlets, Kate Beckinsale was a sight of comeliness as Ava Gardner. Ava Maria! She looked hot! Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, Danny Huston, and the great John C. Reilly were competent 'aviator' attendants as the supporting acting co-pilots of 'The Aviator'. The film's cinematography, art direction, and costume design were stellar and not in the 'just plane' category. The only downfall of 'The Aviator' was its overlong running time. This nearly three-hour film flight should have landed at the 2-hour runway. Still, it should be your priority not to miss the next theatre flight of 'The Aviator'. **** Good",8,2,4,31 December 2004

","Many horny high school students throughout history have tried to solve the pie equation. No! Not the 3.14 one, but the one that makes them as shagadelic as an overmojoed Austin Powers. My friends that would be called the 'American Pie ' equation. These and many more hilarious pursuits are rekindled in a very funny film called ( Yes! You guessed it!) 'American Pie.' This hilarious gem is about four high school students who make a pact to lose their virginity by graduation ( or in other words solve the 'American Pie' equation.) The movie contains some outrageous scenes such as a powerful laxative that will make you pee in your pants, a new meaning to the term the world wide web, and a beer that is definitely not less filling. To rephrase the great Forrest Gump or in this case I will call him Forrest Hump- ' Life is like an American Pie, you never know how horny is going to get.' ****Good",8,0,0,27 February 2000
Burn After Reading," Burn Baby Burn, It is a Coen Comedic Farce Inferno!
","Let me spark up this film review of the new Coen Brothers' offering 'Burn After Reading' with witty pun banter in order for you not to burn before reading. The Coens return to their screwball dark comedy noir with 'Burn After Reading' that, by the way, practices the cinematic characterization of 'no country for dull men'. The film's central characters possess an unremitting egoistic-burning sensation that intertwines swimmingly with their screwball behavior for supreme sheer entertainment value. These quirky characters nearly supersede and extinguish the plot of 'Burn After Reading'; because I would burn up with laughter every time they displayed their surreal eccentricities and not care so much on the narrative's developments. But there is still a plot to be told of 'Burn After Reading'. John Malkovich plays Osborne Cox, a hot-tempered CIA Analyst who writes a memoir after he wrathfully resigns from his CIA long-term employment. Brad Pitt and Frances McDormand exercise their acting by portraying Chad & Linda, two gym trainers who inadvertently end up with a copy of Cox's CD memoir and consequently want to play the blackmail game with The Wizard of Mad Os. George Clooney plays Harry Pfarrer, a neurotic U.S. Marshall whose mentally-deranged marshal plan is overflowed with profound paranoia. Harry is having an affair with Cox's domineering pediatrician wife Katie played by the stupendous Tilda Swinton. Character-actor king Richard Jenkins plays Ted Treffon, the reserved gym owner who craves for the romantic acceptance of Linda. David Rasche and J.K. Simmons play two CIA Operatives who are trying to unscramble all this burning mess into a concise, well-read depiction. Are you now burned out after reading the mishmash chaos of 'Burn After Reading'? Whatever the case, Joel and Ethan Coen continue their hot Hollywood streak by cleverly writing up characters which encompass scene-stealing qualities. I will be burning mad if the film does not garner a Screen Actors Guild 'Best Ensemble Acting' nomination. All the actors were phenomenal. But primary props have to go to Pitt's hilarious performance as the dumbbell Chazz, McDormand's usual skin-deep wondrous acting as the cosmetic-surgery obsessed Linda, and Malkovich just being the great John Malkovich as the mad Cox Osborne. My only minor burning issue with the auteurs here was the slight overacting of George Clooney, but maybe I am just being too paranoid here a la his character Harry. So maybe you have read other film reviews that outmatch mines on the breakdown & analysis of 'Burn After Reading', but I do not think you will find another 'Burn After Reading' film review that has as many 'Puns During Reading' as the one delivered by yours truly. Burn rubber today and book a visit to 'Burn After Reading'. ***** Excellent",Null,1,6,21 September 2008
The Bourne Identity," Bourne to be A Lively Hit!
","Audiences & critics have identified Director Doug Liman's new film `The Bourne Identity' as a very well-crafted flick. However, there have been others who have renamed it `The Bored Identity.' I could see why some have said the latter since the film does drag at times. However, I mostly have to agree with the former because `The Bourne Identity' is just one cool amnesiac spy flick. Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne. Poor Mr. Bourne is a superspy who suffers from amnesia on the streets of paris. He teams up with the beautiful Franka Potente and now we have a identity case of 2 innocent fugitives on the run, who are now being chased by everybody and their `bourne' relatives & forefathers. Damon does a credible job as Bourne who is `good well hunted' throughout most of the film. Franka Potente is illuminating as the innocent girl-on-the-run. Potente proves she has a lot acting potential. `The Bourne Identity' is one film that you should identify to see quickly. **** Good",7,0,1,5 September 2002
The Italian Job," Mini-Cooper Saves The Day!
","`The Italian Job' is not based on the documentary of my favorite restaurant Pauloluigi. Hey Paulo! Free plug there! What about sponsoring my weekly movie review show? Anyway, `The Italian Job' stars Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker, a renegade brigand who is on a vengeance journey against a former colleague who violently betrayed him. We have experienced this plot development before numerous times, so that is why I feel they should have changed the title of this film to `The Battalion Job'.  Yes, the same old redundant premise of a protagonist seeking revenge to a former friend who is now a present foe. Charlize Theron co-stars as Stella Bridger, the safe breaker who joins up the Marky Mark `Steeler' team. Even though  it is a safe bet to say that Charlize looks hot, her work here was a dull & unchallenging one. Obviously, unlike her daring Oscar-winning performance in `Monster'. Edward Norton disappoints here as Steve, the bad boy nemesis. However, I must state that `The Italian Job' does present a marvelous exhibition of product placement. Which product you ask? As if you did not know; let's just say, we will call it: `Mini-Cooper'. These stylish transports will drive you crazy to purchase one. `The Italian Job' had plenty of pasta but was a bit cheesy.

","Oh!!!!!! Lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could not understand why `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' was nominated for so many Oscars? In fact, my fellow man, I think this film should be shipped right out of every multiplex cinema in the country. I was never engaged to this ring tale about wizards, hobbits, and dragons. I hope the film chokes and has a severe case of `ring around the collar' on oscar night.  I did not like anything about this film! The wizards should be locked up in `oz' prison, the hobbits were very earrryyyy, and the dragons should have stayed in their dungeon.

Lilo & Stitch," King of Disney Films!
","In cinema history there have been a few contrasting characters that have generated immense screen chemistry: `Martin & Lewis', `Nolte & Murphy', `Tucker & Chan' to name a few. The latest entry to this illustrious category is `Lilo & Stitch'. This amazing entertaining Disney film stars a Hawaiian orphan girl who befriends a ferocious alien creature. Lilo is an avid fan of Elvis Presley. Stitch is an avid fan of anything that has the capability of being torn to pieces. In other words, Stitch is no `hound dog'. Speaking of the king, Disney: I would like to `thank you very much' for inserting Elvis music into `Lilo & Stitch'. Lilo develops a `burning love' for Stitch even though he converts her house into a `break hotel'. Lilo's older sister Nina has the challenging duty of being Lilo's caretaker. Because she is a young caretaker, an exuberant social worker investigates Lilo's habitual situation. His `suspicious mind' makes him think that Lilo is not living in a suitable environment  because of Nina's unemployed situation and Stitch's anger management situation. He pressures Nina for the situations to change or he will `return to send her' a notice stating that she must `surrender' Lilo. At the same time, Stitch is `all shook up' when realizes he is being chased by aliens who have been instructed to return stitch back to his extra-terrestrial homeland. The one-eyed pursuant alien should have been instructed to have ` a little less conversation , a little more action'. `Lilo & Stitch' is by far my favorite Disney film. Some of you might say this is a bit of an overstatement and might inform me to `don't be cruel' to such Disney classics as `Cinderella', `Fantasia', and `The Lion King'. However, Disney is all about imagination and `Lilo & Stitch' is bombarded with it. So `if you are lonesome tonight', spend the evening with `Lilo & Stitch'. ***** Excellent",9,2,3,3 January 2003
The Revenant," Reved up with this one!
","Acclaimed & Oscar-winning filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu went from a Birdman seeking redemption to a Frontiersman seeking revenge. His latest stellar work comes in the form of 'The Revenant'. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as the aforementioned 1800's frontiersman named Hugh Glass who seeks vengeance against his fellow frontiermen who left him for dead after a bear attack. I guess they could not bear seeing Glass in such pain or maybe not. Glass is made out of thick glass with his focused resiliency to get those who did him wrong. Let's just say that he has viable justification to be an angry man. Oh, and as far as his marital status: he once had a love and it was no gas, soon turned out it was the heart of Hugh Glass; sorry for that 'Blondie' moment there. Anyways, Inarritu marveled with his courageous direction of 'The Revenant'. His script of the picture, which he co-wrote with Mark Smith, was a revelation on revenge; but this movie shines more with the physical than the verbose and that is its brilliant makeup. Two-time cinematography Oscar champ Emmanuel 'Chivo' Lubezki presented what is probably one of the most breathtaking photography I have seen in a motion picture with his work in 'The Revenant'; y no estoy chivando! Now to Mr. DiCaprio! It is one of my favorite Leo performances and it is his most impressive physical thespian effort of his illustrious career with his Glassified offering. Tom Hardy was exceptional as Fitzgerald the Frontiersman. Other fine supporting performances derived from Will Poulter as Bridges the Frontiersman, and Domhnall Gleeson as Captain Henry. In the end, 'The Revenant' is something to see. ***** Excellent",10,6,17,31 December 2015
Bridge of Spies," Spielberg once again is building strong cinematic bridges!
","Master auteur Steven Spielberg's latest movie 'Bridge of Spies' is not falling down, not falling down, not falling down. OK, I think my Bridge of Puns is nearly extinguishing you from further reading. But please continue to read for puns' sake. This 1950's true story film adaptation stars the splendiferous Tom Hanks as insurance lawyer James Donovan who inexplicably is delegated to defend arraigned Russian spy Rudolf Abel, exceptionally & subtlety played by Mark Rylance. Donovan is conflicted on defending a Russian spy and all the negative publicity it will receive; and not to mention how it will affect his family. Spielberg once again puts on the genius directorial cap with his intelligent direction of a Steven flick; and there are no bridge of lies with that statement. Another truth you have to handle is that Tom Hanks keeps on putting up strong work; he captivates with his starring performance as Donovan. But it is Rylance here who is the master thespian of the movie, and you can rely on that. Would you want me to add more on the movie? Would it help? But a few tidbits I will add: loved Thomas Newman's score of the picture and the solid screenplay from Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman. That's all I have to say about this movie. In other words, I would rather not be a spoiler spy and let you cross the rest of the 'Bridge of Spies'. ***** Excellent",9,0,2,15 January 2016
Cold Mountain," Good view of Cold Mountain!
","Almost every freeze frame of the epic `Cold Mountain' is encompassed with ravishing cinematography, an authentic art direction, and a heart-rending musical score. Those are definitely the hot properties of `Cold Mountain'. Jude Law stars as Inman, a Civil War soldier who is on an enduring journey to Cold Mountain to reunite with his love- Ada Monroe.  Ada is played by newcomer Nicole Kidman. Just a little kidman kidding!   Part of `Cold Mountain' revolves around the series of adventures that Inman is confronted with on his journey, which very much resembles `Homer's Odyssey'. The other side of the mountain focuses on Ada's desperation for her Inman to return, and the friendship she develops with the tough grassroots southern farmgirl Ruby- here played with dynamism by Renee Zellweger. Director Anthony Minghella continues to prove that he is mountains above many other directors as far as adapting epic literary works into major motion pictures. However, I must give the cold shoulder to the screenplay of  `Cold Mountain. It was a bit falsifying and way too melodramatic. Nevertheless, `Cold Mountain' is high enough with positive attributes for you to climb on to. **** Good",8,1,2,1 February 2004
Kung Fu Panda 2," Kung Fu Writing! Just for pun kicks!
","I Want Pandy!!! So I decided to get my kicks with a 'Kung Fu Panda 2' viewing. I was aware that it was a sequel and there is always a 'more of the same' element to sequels. However, I was pandily surprised that 'Kung Fun Panda 2' played at more being a prequel than a sequel. Dragon Warrior Po (awesomely voiced again by Jack Black) is now on a mission to defend Kung Fu & China with his mates 'The Furious Five' against an evil peacock called NBC, I mean Shen. However, within the fighting pandamonium there is also a subplot in the movie of Po trying to search his past and figure out who he really is and where he is from. The two plot lines interconnect in 'Kung Fu Panda 2' not just to provide narrative depth to the movie, but to present how one's upbringing is so relevant to one's survival & also character. 'Kung Fu Panda 2' looks beautiful on screen, and besides the latest computer graphic animation design included in the movie there is also 'old school' simple animation inserted to differentiate the time periods. Director Jennifer Yuh did a yeoman's job or should I say yuhwoman's job by incorporating noble Chinese culture into the narrative, as a love letter to China. However, Yuh did get carried away with too many explosion sequences that for the most part bombed. Nevertheless, it is the comedic protagonist Po that makes the Kung Fu Panda movies work. Po still demonstrates that his love for the culinary arts is still his favorite thang! This Panda still loves to munch it down. I just hope we don't see an offshoot of his dietary habits in a Part 3 called 'Kung Poo Panda'. Besides Black, Angelina Jolie also nailed it once again with her lipwork as Tigress, 20% of The Furious Five. Gary Oldman playing a villain never gets old, and he does some badass vocal work as Shen the Peacock. Dustin Hoffman just gets in a scene or two this time around voicing Master Shifu, but when Hoffman speaks you better listen 'He's talking here!!'. 'Kung Fu Panda 2' does not hit on all cylinders, but it is no ancient Chinese secret that it is quite entertaining, mostly due to its Black comedy! **** Good",8,0,3,28 May 2011
American Psycho," Cut Classic!
","I am being serious or should I say serial when i say that `American Psycho' will be one of the best films of the year. Oh my christ! I almost forgot- It also has one of the best acting performances of the year from Christian Bale. This dark, but yet, brilliant film is about an 80's yuppie who moonlights as a disturbed serial killer. Bale's star-breaking performance should ring bells to oscar voters when they decide the best actor nominees. Director Mary Harron's  unique style of craftsmanship was right-on. Also, you will not hear a more creative screenplay in a film this year ¬ñ especially in the scenes when Bale's character is describing his version of 80's musicians societal insights as he is nonchalantly murdering and seducing his preys. The `hip to be square' scene is one of the best of the year- so spread the news. Hopefully, I have said enough to have `psyched' you up to go watch this flawless film. ***** Excellent",10,1,2,6 November 2000
Little Miss Sunshine," Sunny Delight!
","Quirky characters have always been a necessary criterion in dialogue-driven independent films. The indie sunsation, I mean sensation 'Little Miss Sunshine' glows to that mold exactly. Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette star as Richard & Sheryl Hoover. Richard is a struggling motivational speaker whose egoistic tactics derail his career instead of motivate it for success. Sheryl is the Gibraltar of the Hoover Damn Family who tries to put everything in its place doing rocky times at the Hoover Damn. Steve Carell plays Sheryl's gay brother Frank, who unsuccessfully tries to commit suicide because quite frankly his gay lover left him because he was no longer considered the top Prost scholar. Paul Dano plays Dwayne Hoover, the angst tacit teenage Hoover son who has resorted to 'sounds of silence' to allow him to escape from the family torments. Alan Arkin plays Grandpa Edwin Hoover who is the antithesis of Dwayne. Gramps talks way too much about anything he has his mind on. And then there is the Little Sunshine herself. Abigail Breslin plays Olive Hoover, the young pageant-obsessed Hoover girl who has qualified to enter in the Little Miss Sunshine beauty contest in California. 'Little Miss Sunshine' is a bright & wonderful family road trip film which focuses on the Hoover mission to get Olive to the pageant in Cali. Michael Arndt has written a delightful script which is worthy to be called a 'piece of Arndt'. Directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Paris also should be noted for their big dynamic duo effort in developing 'Little Miss Sunshine'. However, it was the stellar cast of this film that really 'brought the sunshine in'. Could very well be the premier acting ensemble of 2006. All are worthy of Oscar nominations! The scene-stealing work of Arkin has to garner a Best Supporting Actor nom! Make the sunshine of your movie life a viewing of 'Little Miss Sunshine'. ***** Excellent",9,1,4,20 September 2006
Hugo," Scorsese scores again!
","Legendary Director Martin Scorsese likes movies; he really, really likes them. Sorry to start this review with a Sally Field-esque play on words, but I just had to mention that since Scorsese's latest gem 'Hugo' is Marty's love letter to movies and film preservation. 'Hugo' stars child actor Asa Butterfield as the title character. Hugo is an orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in the 1930's, and works the station's clock due to the absence of who is supposed to be working the clock that being Hugo's lush uncle who goes missing due to his clockwork drunkenness. Hugo's later father, played by Jude Law, was an inventor who was trying to fix a robot before his unfortunate death in a museum fire. Hugo goes to extremes to find a heart-shaped key to run the automation of the robot that his late father was working on. Hugo befriends Isabelle the goddaughter of George Melies, the cranky toy store owner whose past holds a cinematic secret that that might be the key to Hugo's robotic dreams. Scorsese's illuminating and heartfelt picture is truly movie magic due to the vision of master Marty. John Logan's 'Hugo' screenplay was solid, but at times it stalled in its narrative progression. But in all, Logan's word-run with 'Hugo' was worthy. Ben Kingsley was superb (when isn't he?) as Melies, and child actor Butterfield's time has come in the movie business with his impressive debut as Hugo. I have inspected Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as the Hugo-intimated 'Station Inspector', and I must say that it passed its thespian inspection. Chloe Grace Moretz continues her rise to 'tween actress' supremacy with another impressive turn, here with her charismatic performance as Isabelle. The art direction of 'Hugo' is a piece of cinematic beauty with its timeless depiction of 1930's Paris; and in due time it will garner the Best Art Direction Academy Award. I think it's time for me to end my 'Hugo' review. And the time has also come for you to set your clock for a 'Hugo' viewing. **** Good",8,2,4,14 January 2012
American Beauty," CINEMATIC BEAUTY!
","They say the american dream is to find that beautiful successful significant other for a lifetime, live in a two-story house  with a white picket fence, and have two children that are  not a disciplinary challenge. This will make you happy? Right!! Think again! We are now almost living in the 21st century my friends! Things have changed! The american dream is now to breakaway from your significant other by craving for your daughter's sexy friend, start buffing up so she could crave for you, and begin smoking some good weed. The american dream also now consists to have an affair with your business competitor but be careful not to get caught so your two-story house with that white (or should I say black) picket fence could still be yours. I have just described the plot of one of the best films of the year- 'American Beauty.' Without a doubt, it is the best-acted film of 1999. Kevin Spacey has just become the frontrunner for the Best Actor Oscar. There will be reason to suspect if he does not get nominated. You could beatty I mean bet that Annette Bening will also get nominated. Co-star Chris Cooper's performance is gripping, insightful, and simply sensational. It will not be too cool if Cooper does not get nominated for a Supporting Acting Nod. Young stars Mena Suvari, Thora Birch, and Wes Bentley execute some real cool thespian stuff also. It was just a film with all-star performances. I also congratulate the filmmakers of 'American Beauty' for making a film that has put the black beauty back into cinema.

Warrior," The Mixed Martial Artists get it done in this winning flick!
","Movie Warriors, come out and seeeeee 'Warrior'. You will not regret it! I am still dumbfounded how this movie did not make more money at the box office. 'Warrior' is a gritty film starring Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton as estranged brothers Tommy and Brendan Conlon. Tommy is an introverted, rage-filled former Marine who wants to make a return run to mixed martial arts and participate in a 'big money, winner takes all' infamous tournament called Sparta. The elder Brendan is a devoted husband, father of two girls, and physics teacher; how is that for a white-picket fence physics equation. When Brendan cannot make the mortgage payments on his home and is on the brink of foreclosure, he decides to also make a return run to mixed martial arts to bring in the extra flow, and therefore also trains for Sparta. So yes, Tommy and Brendan do yell in unison in one of the movie's scenes 'We Are Sparta!!!'; OK, that did not happen but its just part of the close to '300' puns that I insert in each of my movie reviews. Nick Nolte co-stars as Paddy Conlon, the alcoholic father of Tommy and Brendan who definitely did not play 'paddy cake' with his sons during their childhood. In other words, Brendan and Tommy do not take a liking to Paddy due to his past lush life. Tommy does ask Paddy to train him for Sparta in just a mere trainer-fighter relationship. Jennifer Morrison also co-stars as Tess, Brendan's supporting but scared wife; and Frank Grillo puts it in the acting grill with his supporting effort as Frank Campana, Brendan's friend and after some St. Brendan praying & begging to Frank, eventual trainer. I will not reveal too much what happens in the Sparta, but let's say that the Conlon brothers from the same father & mother, do make their match. Director Gavin O'Connor excelled in helming 'Warrior' in all aspects of the movie including the fight scenes, the brother/father relationships, and in the sport that is mixed martial arts. O'Connor and fellow screenwriters Anthony Tambakis & Cliff Dorfman did not exactly pin down a perfect screenplay in 'Warrior', but good enough to take worthy of. The uprising Tom Hardy, who delivered in my eyes one of the most astounding acting performances in the last 5 years with his bravado leading performance in 'Bronson', continues to rise up the thespian charts with another strong performance here as Tommy. Joel Edgerton did not match Hardy's performance 'pound for pound' but Edgerton's work as Brendan was mixed with more good than bad. But the granddaddy or at least daddy performance of them all was Nick Nolte's stellar work as the Moby Dick obsessed pop Paddy, who even garnered a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor nomination for his passionate thespian effort. I must cut now to the part of the brilliant editing of 'Warrior'. Unfortunately, the film's editing did not make the cut of the Best Editing Oscar nominated films but it sure deserved it. So get your kicks and thrills (and maybe a few punches) with the magnetism of 'Warrior'. ***** Excellent",9,0,2,19 March 2012
Silver Linings Playbook," 'Like' this Playbook!
","Call me crazy, deranged, maniacal (why not, everybody else does), or whatever you like, but there is no doubt in my complex mind that 'Silver Linings Playbook' is one of the best movies I have ever seen. A 21st Century Masterpiece! Writer-Director David O. Russell has orchestrated a divine, genuine flick about a Philly 'born and bred' 30ish man who has been released from a mental institution who returns to live with his parents and also battles his bipolar disorder. The man I am referring to is Pat, who was put in the mental institution due to almost beating to death the man who his wife was having an affair with. Pat is still obsessed with his wife and stands pat in focusing on getting her back. Pat's parents are Pat Sr. and Dolores. Pat Sr. cares about his son dearly, but his main bird it seems is the obsession he has with the NFL Football team The Philadelphia Eagles. Dolores is your typical loving mom who primarily cares about comforting and smothering her offsprings. Pat gets introduced with Tiffany, a vivacious Philly gal who also has some mental challenges of her own and is still trying to cope with the death of her husband. The silver lining here is that this brilliant film becomes a utopia odyssey on dealing with broken pasts and adjusting to novice changes. Pat dismisses Tiffany mucho times due to his obsession on reconciling with his wife; but when Tiffany asks Pat to be his partner in a dance competition, the playbook is up and running on how their life readjusts with those moves. Writer-Director David O. Russell's masterpiece works on all levels due to his skillful integration of family, psychology, obsession, regret, love, and so many more authentic aspects of the film that perfects its craftsmanship. Russell's script is on the playbook as the best of the year with so many unforgettable verbiage; and is there a better written-scene in a movie this year when Tiffany is explaining to Pat Sr. that his son Pat Jr. is really a good-luck charm to the Eagles when Pat Jr. spends time with her. Bradley Cooper's starring performance as Pat Jr. is the best of his career, and should be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar; and no I am not hungover. Even without speaking in tongues, Cooper's gaze expresses so much about his character's condition. Jennifer Lawrence has just catapulted as my favorite young actress working today with her exceptional performance as Tiffany. Robert DeNiro is back baby! Yes, I am talking to you! His lively performance as Pat. Sr. is vintage DeNiro and is line for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Jacki Weaver showed that her Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for 'Animal Kingdom' was no fluke, and is in the kingdom of exemplary thespian talent. It was also great to see Chris Tucker return to form with his charismatic supporting performance as Pat's friend from the mental institution. The game plan for 'Silver Linings Playbook' was executed to the max, and hopefully is in line for many Oscar nominations. So get your entertainment playbook in gear, and schedule a visit to the 'Silver Linings Playbook'. ***** Excellent",10,4,9,18 November 2012

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," It's a Finch for King David to always direct a great movie! And Rooney Rules!
","I wish I could start my review of David Fincher's 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' as riveting as the film's infamous 'Immigrant Song' opening. But I am foreign to those type of stellar intros unless there are plenty of corny puns on the menu. Many, including yours truly, thought there was no need to make American versions of the 2009 Swedish film franchise which was adapted from Stieg Larsson's best-seller Swedish novels. But since it would have the Fincherprints of the master auteur David Fincher, I thought maybe it would turnout alright; and it sure did! At least, the first installment did. David Fincher's version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' is simply one of the best films of 2011. For those of you who are not familiar with the premise, I will ink it for you. It is about a disgraced Swedish journalist named Mikael Blomkvist who gets hired by a wealthy Swedish geriatric billionaire named Henrik Vanger to investigate the 40-year-old mystery of the disappearance of his granddaughter Harriet; her case was unsolved and her body was never found, so Vanger wants someone to do a bang-up job and finally solve the mystery. Henrik is even suspicious that someone from his Vanger familial bunch was responsible for Harriet's disappearance. In return, Blomkvist gets mucho cashola and undisclosed information from Henrik about the corporate magnet that Mikael has been trying to pin for many years. So how does that chic with that dragon pic in her skin fit into the picture? In mucho ways! Lisbeth Salander is the name, computer hacking is the game, and her Gothic fashion is not lame. And by the way, you don't want to make a sexual move on a first date with this Salander Girl, or else you will be sorry; just ask her monstrous welfare officer Nils Bjurman. I will just leave it at that, and if you have not seen it, I will be hush about Lisbeth's vengeful show on not-Nine Inch Nils (a little kudos there also to Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and movie composer pal Atticus Ross for another mesmeric score to a Fincher flick). Lisbeth who knows all about Blomkvist due to her hacking ways, eventually teams up with him to try to solve the Harriet disappearance. Fincher's well-tuned directorial techniques were very pulsating throughout the Tattoo picture, and Oscar-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian's Tattoo scribe read very well in its verbal intercourse. As much as I loved the Fincher and the Zaillian's labor efforts to the Tattoo, my favorite contributor to this movie was that of Rooney Mara's tour-de-force starring performance as Lisbeth Salander. Let's just say that Rooney Mara was a giant among scene- steelers throughout the movie. Daniel Craig's performance as Blomkvist was spectacular and there is nothing to libel about that sentiment. Christopher Plummer turned out another great performance as Henrik Vanger from this now Oscar-winner veteran thespian. The steady Swedish actor Stellan Skarsgard was stellar as Harriet's brother Martin Vanger. Kudos also goes out to Robin Wright's right-on work as Blomkvist's lover and boss Erika Berger. And this Joel has to commend a Joely of course; because Joely Richardson turned out a genuine supporting performance as one of the Banger women, Anita Banger; say Anita Banger five times real quick; just saying. I see now why Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall picked up yet another Best Film Editing Oscar in a Fincher movie; because just from the film's opening, you know they were going to be immigrating to the Oscar stage. 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' might not fully- capture you in its initial viewing (especially if you have read the novel or seen the Swedish film version since you know what is going to happen), but this Fincherpiece will stay in your mind and there is Mara of where that came from. ***** Excellent",9,4,10,7 April 2012
Dreamgirls," The Dream Team deserving of a Silver Medal!
","Keep dreaming if you agree with some moviegoers and critics that Bill Condon's 'Dreamgirls' is the finest cinematic feast of 2006. However, I must state that the storyline and screenplay was capturing enough to be a bit dreamy. The film centers around The Dreams, a Supremes-type of black trio soul-singing gals, and their rise to prominence and stardom. Jamie Foxx stars as a shady musical manager named Curtis Taylor. He gives The Dreams their embryonic phases of recognition by contracting them to sing backup to a renowned James Brown-type soul singer named James 'Thunder' Early. Some have called Eddy Murphy's performance as Early the best of the year. Even though it was a vibrant performance, I think it is too early to categorize it in that echelon. OK, here is where Dreams come true (Yea, I know! It was a very Mickey Mouse statement!) : The Dreams eventually do mature to break out of the background singer supporting world and reach the apex of lead recording artists success, but not with some nightmares along the way. One of the Dreamies named Effie leaves the trio because of jealousy and stubbornness, another Dreamie named Deena marries Taylor and reaches Divaland but also 'divas covering' the ruthlessness of the music industry. I will not wake you up in the middle of your 'Dreamgirls' dream and spoil the rest for you. Writer-Director Bill Condon does 'Condonly' protect 'Dreamgirls' from a musical cinematic epidemic by orchestrating some thrilling scenes featuring the amazing Jennifer Hudson, who plays Effie. However, I think Condon played risky movie musical business by not wrapping it up fast enough in some elongated conversation-musical scenes that was the nightmare of 'Dreamgirls'. As far as the leads, Beyonce Knowles was middling as Deena and Foxx was not his usual 'foxtrotting' acting self as Taylor. No doubt that 'Dreamgirls' was Jennifer Hudson's acting & musical showcase! The J. Hudson River has channeled its waters in Tinsletown and it might be sailing with a potential Oscar statuette for Best Supporting Actress. Jenny, I think Hollywood is got your production number and they want to make you theirs. Though it did a have a few yawns, 'Dreamgirls' is one film worth waking up to. **** Good",8,0,2,11 January 2007
Being John Malkovich," BEING ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF 99
","'Being John Malkovich' will be one cinematic experience that you will treasure forever! This is definitely the most inventive film that has come out in a very long time. This is  'In The Line of Fire' of the great films of 1999. Its wittiness will find 'A Place In Your Heart.' John Cusack's performance is 'Alive' and full of spunk. Cameron Diaz and Catherine Keener continue to do great work and that is why they are 'The Objects Of Beauty' of many casting agents.  Let's not forget dear John Malkovich, who at even being himself executes one of the best performances of the year. Also, both director Spike Jonze and screenplay writer Charlie Kaufman both highly deserve oscar nominations. 'What is this movie about?' You ask. Well, I hate to inform you but this time I wont be the 'Liaison' in describing the film because it will be very 'Dangerous' for me to do that. 'What?' You say. Just be John Malkovich and find out! *****Excellent",10,1,3,27 February 2000
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Virguoisity good comedy
","If you have not been de-virginized by inserting yourself to see the lauded 'The 40 Year Old Virgin', then you have not reached the ultimate climax in film comedy for 2005. The laughable Steve Carell stars as Andy Stitzer, a sound-store stock supervisor who has never made love to a woman in his 40 years of dull existence. That does not 'sound' very good for Andy! He has 'come' close but no cigars! Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen co-star as his partners in virgin watch whom are determined to come to a means to an end to get Andy out of the morbid state of 'Virginia'. Catherine Keener plays Trish, the E-Bay products store owner who auctions herself to Andy as his potential 'virgin breaker', or in other words Trish is the tasty dish that Andy falls for. The film is packed with side-splitting gags that are of the 'sexual comical healing' material. The masturbating 'hello', condom for dummy virgins, and most notably the chest hair waxing scenes will be the 'hair apparent' supreme comical scenes of the year. Carell's subtle but yet magnetic performance should break him in as one of the superb comical actors of our present time. The great Keener always contributes excellent keen thespian awareness to her roles and here is no different as Trish. Rudd also contributes an amusing performance as the heartbroken porno-enthusiast David. Rudd was 'porn to be alive' to play that supporting role. Director Judd Apatow does have a juicy raunchy appetite for comedy and shows that Judd is no comedic directorial dud. However, his only misfire was to elongate 'The 40 Year Old Virgin's' running time 30 minutes over its satisfactory climax level. Nevertheless, Apatow & Carell which by the way also impressively scribed the film, are on their way to comedic greatness in pleasing all our comedy film desires for many years to 'come'. **** Good",8,1,2,20 November 2005

Jarhead," Jarring!
","Director Sam Mendes' war flick 'Jarhead' is about a battle-less war. The film is based on former marine Anthony Swofford's best-selling 2003 book about his pre-Desert Storm experiences in Saudia Arabia and about his experiences fighting 'or not fighting for that matter' in Kuwait. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the cocky and mutinous Swofford who probably got in trouble in his uneasy childhood for going into the cookie jar way too many times without permission. However, that is not why he is a 'jarhead'. Jarhead is the term given to fighting marines. The film co-stars Peter Sarsgaard as the defiant Corporal Troy, Jamie Foxx as the hard-Knox Sgt. Sykes, Lukas Black as the government pundit Corporal Kruger, and Chris Cooper as the marine lifer Lt. Col. Kazinski. These charismatic supporting actor battalion deserve kudos for their auteur efforts ; noteworthy goes to Saarsgard though. Director Sam Mendes sets the cinematic battleground of 'Jarhead' in the eagerness & desperation of the marines in their quest for combat in a battle-dry situation. Gyllenhaal's gritty leading performance was credible and courageous. Even though his doggy-style gay character in 'Brokeback Mountain' broke more backs in battle than his Swofford character in 'Jarhead'. Where I do have to give medals of cinema honor to 'Jarhead' was in its astounding cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. Thomas Newman's musical score was also right on the note target. So all in all, I say 'OOO RAH' to 'Jarhead' and give it a favorable recommendation. **** Good",8,0,1,10 November 2006
Collateral," A Fantastic Cruise Vehicle!
","Let me start out by stating that this review is not going to be complimentary for you to read. I mean, I have been hitting on this `Collateral' film review for the last few days. In other words, I have been a review hitman. Hey, I know times are tough with the economy and all of that (for more of this issue: see `Fahrenheit 911').  So if you do not have cash, we will accept that. However, you must leave something as collateral. Ok, don't go and leave this review! Stay collateral with me on this one! `Collateral' of course stars Tom Cruise as Vincent, a psychopath hitman who is on a job to exterminate 5 L.A. witnesses & district attorneys involved in a drug trafficking case. On his mission possible, Vincent collaterals with Max; an L.A. cabbie who reluctantly drives Vincent to all his hit locations. Eventually, this Mad Max gets quite aware of the lethal weapon that he is driving. Cruise was a real hit as Vincent! His grayish hair & suit represent a certain decrepit aura about him; a self-assured villain who is really an enclosed catastrophe.  Cruise commands the screen; you can't take your eyes off him. There is no gray area in that statement. Foxx was a real foxxy cabbie with his outstanding neuropath work as Max. This breakthrough performance puts him in the elite category of one of the best African-American actors of today. I will give up my left nut as collateral and bet that these two will garner Oscar nominations. Ok, so I am a little nutty! How can I forget about the main mann of this film though? Director michael Mann's stylish techniques in manifesting a turbulent evening in Los Angeles is manly enough to be highly regarded during awards season. Also, screenwriter Stuart Beattie did not beat around the bush while scribing some eye-opening dialogue. All in all, `Collateral' is a Cruise vehicle emotionally driven by Foxx and wisely mannuevered by Mann.**** Good",8,0,2,8 August 2004
Dunkirk," Nolan is the man!
","The great auteur Christopher Nolan has just orchestrated his most mature and visceral picture in his esteemed career. I am referring to the true World War II story 'Dunkirk'. It is based during the early part of the war when French and British allies where stuck in the Dunkirk beach as they are attacked by the German nemesis. British civilians with their ferry boats put on their heroic hats and went on a mission to save the British soldiers. Nolan integrates the viewer right into the dungeons of 'Dunkirk'; either by sea, land, and air. The narrative is presented into these three segments; sea in a day, land in a week, and air in an hour. And they come all together masterfully due to Nolan's firepower. 'Dunkirk' is Nolan's show. I have never seen a war movie depicted in a fashion where one never sees the enemies and there is such little bloodshed, but works so astoundingly. It is mostly a profound evacuation picture. Now there are actors here that due solid work; Mark Rylance as the civilian seaman, Cillian Murphy as a rescued pilot, Tom Hardy as an air force pilot; and also some young actors that really pulled their acting landing in Fionn Whithead, Damien Bonnard, and Harry Styles; yes I went that direction, that Harry Styles. Hans Zimmer's score is riveting and propels the movie in a very gripping manner. The cinematography, art direction, and production design all allied to perfection. But I go back to Nolan, because this was Nolan's land. And if Sir Nolan does not get nominated for a Best Director Oscar, I will be have to be evacuated from watching next year's Academy Awards. 'Dunkirk' is the best film I have seen so far in 2017. ***** Excellent",10,3,11,23 July 2017
The Machinist," The Machinist runs on cinematic greatness!
","'The Machinist' is such a grandiose motor of a film that it has geared its way to film supremacy. This is the most unique and one of the best films of the year. Let me first give you the 'skinny' on its protagonist, Christian Bale. Mr. Batman Begins himself was no Fatman Begins here. Bale lost 60 lbs. to play the part of Trevor Reznik, an industrial worker who has a severe case of insomnia due to not sleeping over a year because of a life-altering event. I will not get into the specifics of the event because that would be a major blunder to this review. Reznik is paranoid & lonely but at the same time has in-depth knowledge & intuition. The thin man Trevor befriends a co-worker named Ivan, who is non-existent to his other colleagues. Is Ivan the Great providing sound guidance to Trevor or is Ivan the Terrible playing psychological mind-games to Trevor? Reznik has two main women in his lives who he sporadically sees: his call girl girlfriend and and airport diner waitress. These fems see the melancholy in Trevor, but they also see the humanity. They both play significant parts in Trevor's unyielding complexities. In fact, I wonder if they see anything at all in Trevor since he is almost physically transparent. Director Brad Anderson's archetypal construction and ingenious design of 'The Machinist' has enough fuel to be classified as one of the best directorial efforts of 2004. Oscar voters' mechanisms needed a tune-up when they snubbed Anderson from a Best Director nomination. The acting of 'The Machinist' was also a well-constructed acting machine. Bale most definitively was the spark plug of the film with his daring and compelling performance. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon were competent maquinitas as the women in Trevor's life. John Sharian was mesmerizing as the overbearing Ivan.'The Machinist' has enough credible cinematic groundbreaking qualities to make this well-tuned machine into a cult classic in the film industry! Gear up to 'The Machinist' asap. ***** Excellent",10,2,3,29 October 2005
Bad Teacher," I am not so hot for 'Bad Teacher', even though it had its periods of laughter!
","Buenos Diaz and welcome to my lecture, I mean review, of the Diaz-driven comedy 'Bad Teacher'. OK, I am not going to fire away on 'Bad Teacher' but I am not going to give it cinematic tenure either. As mentioned, on the starring dais of 'Bad Teacher' is the applelicious Cameron Diaz, who is not bad here, actually she was pretty good. Diaz stars as Elizabeth Halsey, a Middle School Teacher who craves to get a breast ahead of the golddigger sweepstakes by finding conniving ways to get money, so then she can get a boob job so she can marry rich. Halsey's Vomit and other unethical behaviors (showing movies in class, smoking pot, embezzling school fundraising money, etc) throughout her working school day make her a¬Ö¬Ö. see movie title. She catches the eye of Scott Delacorte, a substitute teacher whose parents are immensely wealthy due to their lucrative watch company. Therefore, like clockwork, Elizabeth has her new victim to somehow marry rich in the future. Justin Timberlake was in sync playing the dorky Delacorte, and was hilarious in a school dance scene. Ms. Halsey's rival is fellow teacher Ms. Squirrel solidly portrayed by the up-and-coming Lucy Punch. This Squirrel teeths into Halsey's mischievous ways; and Ms. Squirrel's unorthodox, corny-pun teaching methods might just be as horrific as Ms. Halsey's behaviors. But who am I to criticize corny puns, there are plenty of those already marked in this review. Two other performances that hit the B+ barometer in 'Bad Teacher' were of John Michael Higgins who plays the dolphin- loving Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's only teacher- friend Ms. Davies. However, the thespian valedictorian of 'Bad Teacher' is Jason Segel as P.E. Teacher Russell Gettis, whose repeated Gettisburg Address to get into Elizabeth's pants was quite entertaining. Segel is one of the brightest comedic actors of today, and everything he is in gets automatically bumped up a grade. So why don't I put 'Bad Teacher' in the school of stellar comedies? Due to Director's Jake Kasdan orchestration of 'Bad Teacher' in the last semester, I mean act of the movie. He was off to a great start with some outstanding opening sequences, but as the film went on it sure could have used some creative composition. Gene Stupnitzky & Lee Eisenberg's screenplay has its sporadic hilarious comedic lines within the dialogue, but needed a script tutor for its redundant narrative. I will pass 'Bad Teacher' with a C+, mostly due to its drama team of actors. If you were able to read this pun-driven review, thank your preacher, because I bless you for having the courage. *** Average",7,13,25,26 June 2011
Dallas Buyers Club," The cure of this picture comes from McConaughey and Leto
","Dallas Buyers Club' did not have a complete subscription of exemplary dosage, but it is still one you should buy into. Matthew McConaughey delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as Ron Woodroof, a real-life Dallas electrician homophobe who was diagnosed with AIDS during the mid 80's. Woodroof took the opportunistic route and formed a 'buyers club' to import and sell non-government approved drugs to AIDS patients via a membership program. Let's just say Ron Woodroof just ran with it and wanted to raise the roof of his bank account. Director Jean Marc-Vallee does a credible job in orchestrating the picture with the 'business opportunistic' angle than making it a predictable sympathetic movie in dealing with the film's theme; however, the third act of the movie was way too wearisome for my taste and I was about to ask for a refund for the 'Dallas Buyers Club' during the film's last 30 minutes. The writers' club of 'Dallas Buyers Club' did a good job in scribing some clever zingers mostly coming from Woodroof's character. But no doubt the strengthening endurance of the movie was the lively performance from McConaughey and from Jared Leto who plays Ron's homosexual business partner Rayon. It will not be too difficult to sell the excellence of their thespian work in 'Dallas Buyers Club'; no doubt both will be soon joining the Oscar Nominee Club. So for the most part, medicate yourself with acting greatness from McConaughey & Leto in the 'Dallas Buyers Club'. **** Good",8,3,5,2 December 2013
Control," Take Control of your Joy today! And that is your New Order of the day!
","Sam Riley's mesmerizing performance as former Joy Division lead singer Ian Curtis in the bio pic 'Control' undeniably had control as one of the best of 2007. Director Anton Corbin's cinematic take on the uncontrollable melancholic life of the un-joyous vocalist is a commendable film orchestration. Curtis committed suicide at age 23 in 1980. Corbin reveals Curtis' constant struggles with self-esteem, adultery, epilepsy, and fame throughout the narrative; starting with his post-adolescent days as a British loner to his self-destructive final act. Curtis married at a young age to gentle gal Debbie; but due to the hasty marriage, he consequently fell out of love in the coming years and suffered much self-ridden guilt from it. Curtis, still married, then meets a sexy Belgium named Annik and falls deeply in love with her even though he knows that adulterous 'love will tear him apart'. Corbin also shows us the Joy Division 'transmission' from local band status to rock-solid popularity 'atmosphere' status. The dialogue interactions scenes between the Joy Divisionees and their manager Rob Gretton are the film's comic relief from an otherwise gloomy rock star story. Samantha Morton's auteur work as Mrs. Debbie Curtis was one of the most powerful of the year and Ms. Morton proficiently demonstrates that she never lost control of her character. Joe Anderson, James Anthony Pearson, and Harry Treadaway were no 'dead souls' in their performances as the Joy Division members. They just might be included in the 'New Order' of promising British actors coming our way. And without a doubt you can book Toby Kebbell's effort as Gretton as one that definitely rocked! But it is Riley's ('believe it or not' 'Is that really Ian Curtis?') acting that falls as probably as the most overlooked performance of 2007. I was all hung up when Sam's stunning achievement was 'isolated' away from the Best Actor Oscar nominees list for 2007! I guess there is so much that we can control. Now it is time for you take control and tune in to 'Control' today! ***** Excellent",Null,0,0,27 September 2008
The Exorcist," One of The Scariest!
","`The Exorcist' to many movie fans is the answer to the infamous question said to poor Sydney in the `Scream' trilogy = `What's your favorite scary movie?' `The Exorcist' did scare me. However, it did not possess me enough to declare it the scariest movie of all time. I give that honor to `The Amytiville Horror.' For those of you who do not know, this horror flick is about a pre-adolescent who inhabits a bit of a behavioral problem. I loved the theme song of the film `You Spin Me Round' by Dead or Alive. Ok! I will quit exorcising I mean exercising my sarcasm.  This new version, which includes some old deleted scenes from the original, will also make you sleep with the light on. Linda Blair's haunting performance is one of the best of all time by a child actress. What could have possessed her to take crappy roles afterwards? A new scene to this renovated version is a shattering staircase flip by our protagonist Regan that is very reminiscent of those done by russian gymnasts in style and appearance (ever seen a pretty russian gymnast? Or russian athlete for that matter?) Anyways, make sure that `The Exorcist: The Version You Have Not Seen Before' is one that you will end up having seen before. **** Good",9,2,3,21 August 2001
Ocean's Eleven," Sure Gamble!
","One of the slickest films of the year has to be `Ocean's Eleven.' Director Steven Soderbergh has remade this Rat Pack classic about a heist in Las Vegas with a golden nugget touch. It also contains some excalibur performances by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Andy Garcia, and Don Cheadle. It also has made some booming business at the box office that has probably made some MGM executives grand with anger that they did not produce the film. Clooney plays Danny Ocean an expert thief who recruits 10 skilled crafty characters to rob 3 casinos in Las Vegas. The look of Las Vegas has never looked so `luxor'ious in a film until `Ocean's Eleven' that it deserves to be inserted in some type of stratospheric category. The only thing about the film that I should hope was just a mirage was the dull acting of Julia Roberts as the angry ex-wife. All in all, `Ocean's Eleven' is one that you should treasure in your movie collection. **** Good",8,0,0,2 January 2002
Pearl Harbor," Good Strike!
","Aloha film lovers! Many critics felt `Pearl Harbor' bombed at the box office. They also felt it bombed as a film altogether. However, I do have to strike back at these critics and inform them that 'Pearl Harbor' was a very important film to make especially because of September 11. As most of us know, the film is based on that `day of infimacy' when the island of Pearl Harbor was `turning japanese'; we really think so. The movie also depicts a love triangle between two best friends air force fighters and a beautiful nurse. Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett execute decent perfromances in parts I am sure they fought hard for to get. Kate beckinsale is on her way to be registered as  star in the making in her breakthrough role as the conflicted nurse. So make it a `harbor night' and battle your way to view `Pearl Harbor'. **** Good",8,0,2,30 September 2002
Jackie," Mica Levy and Natalie Portman were quite a hit in 'Jackie'
","Jacqueline Kennedy was probably one of the most famed female figures of the 20th Century. Director Pablo Larrian's 'Jackie' focuses on Kennedy's grief period after her infamous President husband John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. Oscar-winner Natalie Portman stars as the former First Lady and marvels in a performance that is quite very presidential and should garner her lots of movie award love. Peter Sarsgaard co-stars in a subtle performance as Bobby Kennedy. One up on Billy Crudup for his fine performance as 'the Reporter' who interviews Kennedy a few weeks after the murder of her husband. It was great to see John Hurt back on the silver screen here playing an advising priest to Mrs. Kennedy. Larrian's directorial effort here was sound & solid and stood up more as an experimental independent piece than a overexposed Oscar-bait delivery. Noah Oppenheim's script was credible but not sensational. Mica Levi's pounding score of the movie was probably its resounding feature; yes, even more than Portman's outstanding performance, that is how brilliant it was. In all, 'Jackie' deserves a viewing. **** Good",8,2,5,22 December 2016
Tropic Thunder," Downey Jr. and Cruise are the thunder and the lightning of 'Tropic Thunder'
","Comedy, Tragedy, Parody- 'Tropic Thunder' does encompass the aforementioned three elements to certain degrees. Comedy- Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Baruchel, and Brandon T. Jackson portray Hollywood thespians who are acting in a 'Platoon'-type war film entitled, what do you know, 'Tropic Thunder'. Stiller is Tugg Speedman, the Hollywood action hero whose latest action film franchise has recently run out of speed. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, the comedic chunky actor who starred in a flatulence-induced comedic franchise called 'The Fatties' and is trying to prove he has the acting diversity to also do le drama. Robert Downey Jr. is Kirk Lazarus, the acclaimed Academy Award winner whose method acting runs in his blood so much that for his lunatic role in Thunder he goes to the dark side by going through a procedure that pigments his skin color and wants it to quote the Stones 'Paint it Black'. Jay Baruchel plays the youthful rookie actor Kevin Sandusky who has been an avid fan of the aforementioned, but is more level headed than his mentors. And Brandon T. Jackson plays Alpha Chino the rapper turned actor who made his claim to fame by promoting an energy drink called 'Booty Sweat'. When the film's director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) has numerous troubling challenges in working with these prima-donnas, the Hollywood studio bosses take notice and desolate the thespian Thunderous group into the isolated jungle fighting a real war against some Asian drug-ring soldiers. What does not strike thunder to these egomaniacs is that they are no longer shooting a film but in fact are really shooting at them! There are certain mundane misfires to that aspect, as it does get monotonous after a few scenes. But fiery comedic turns by Robert Downey Jr. as Lazarus and an unrecognizable Tom Cruise as an authoritative Hollywood studio boss Les Grossman does salvage 'Tropic Thunder' to thunderous laughing explosions that are strictly the bomb! Tragedy- Nick Nolte portraying a former war veteran named Four Leaf Tayback who is also the film's technical adviser was not the four leaf clover 'Tropic Thunder' needed. It was quite a tragedy to observe Nolte playing the same old anger-induced egomaniac character which he has overkilled in many previous Nolte roles. I also did not observe any relevance to the plot in Danny McBride's performance as Cody, the technical effects guru whose clumsy acts were just a failed effectual effort for laughs that were not special in any comedic technicality. Ben Stiller also directed and co-wrote 'Tropic Thunder' and somewhere along the way it was a tragedy to watch Stiller get lost in the jungle with the script and direction of the film by sidetracking it with irrelevant scenes that should have been fired out. Parody- Even though I pulled in a few hard knocks for Stiller, I do commend him for his efforts in deriving the premise of 'Tropic Thunder'. The self-obsessed nature of the film industry were presented to the viewers as messaging that it is part of the fabric nature of making films, and at the end it should not be taken too seriously as long as the cinematic end-product is of above satisfactory material. 'Tropic Thunder' never reaches the jungles of above satisfactory material but it does land us with some classical parody delights in the work of Downey Jr. and Cruise. *** Average",7,1,6,26 August 2008
Inside Out," Inside out, boy you turned me with laughter!
","Disney Pixar's 'Inside Out' is one movie that will stay in my 'cinematic joy' memory bank for a long time. This creative gem focuses on a tween named Riley who moves from Minnesota to San Francisco with her family. Writer-Directors Pete Doctor and Ronnie Del Carmen develop this fascinating film by focusing on the mental emotions inside Riley by developing characters of her emotions; which include Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. Not to sound like a Debbie Downer, but my personal cerebral character of the picture was Sadness; actress Phyllis Smith did a stellar vocal performance as Sadness, which ironically brought me much joy in laughter. Anyways, back to the narrative. When things go wrong inside Riley's brain when Joy is jumped out from Riley's memory headquarters, Riley becomes disillusioned about her new life in San Francisco and finds no joy in it. Joy, alongside Sadness, must find their way back to Riley's Cerebral Headquarters before she loses all emotion. Other solid vocal performances came straight outta the mouths of Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, and Mindy Kaling as Disgust. 'Inside Out' is one smart computer-animated flick you should delve inside to and check out. ***** Excellent",9,7,29,14 November 2015
The Duchess," Not a Duchbag of a film!
","Costume period dramas are a constant bore so why should I spend my time unclothing this one literally style. Because 'The Duchess' is a pretty good one I must say your highnesses. Keira Knightley stars as Georgiana, the Duchess of the Duke of Devonshire in the 18th Century. However, this Duke and Duchess are not the happy aristocratic couple as they do tend to verbally duke it out from time to time. In fact, they are both opposite ends of the spectrum. Georgiana is charismatic, humorous, and enchanting; while the Duke is lifeless, demanding, and egotistical. His only concern with the Duchess is for her to labor a son to be his heir. When the Duchess can only deliver junior duchesses and no mini-Dukes, the Duke chaos follows. Not to mention, the Duchess longs for a charming politician named Charles Grey, but the Duke makes it very difficult for the Duchess to fall into The Grey Zone. Director Saul Dibb does not dibble dabble too much with the same ol' period piece plot. Dibb does a stellar job in characterizing the protagonists so the focus is not primarily focused on the usual elaborate art direction and whopping costumes of most period pieces. Not to say Dibb did not have some help in accomplishing this by hatching out handsomely to Screenwriter Jeffery Hatcher appealing script of the film. Knightley's commanding performance as Georgiana was of extraordinaire reign. Keira is quickly becoming the acting queen of the period piece genre. Ralph Fiennes was pitch perfect as El Duque. And there were some nice thespian supporting touches by Charlotte Rampling as Georgiana's selfish mother Lady Spencer (for hire to have her daughter marry the Duke), and Dominic Cooper as the aforementioned Charles 'Not in Charge' Grey. So my concluding exclamation is that 'The Duchess' is one surprising period film that makes its mark! **** Good",8,2,3,2 January 2010
No Country for Old Men," Another Coencidence of a great film!
","Filmmakers Joel & Ethan Coen might be called 'freaky little people' by Josh Brolin the leading actor of their critically enamored 'No Country For Old Men', but it's all in awe respect for their craftsmanship, nonconformity, and originality. The Cojones Brothers, I mean the Coen Brothers, did again have the cojones to architect an unconventional American tale about the quest for wealth even when violence & crime is presented as an unbreakable barrier to reach the monetary goal. Those are the same underlying themes that the Coens masterfully delivered to us a far decade ago in the 1996 gem 'Fargo'; which was based in Minnesota and North Dakota. This time the Coens set their sights on the lone star state. 'No Country For Old Men' follows Llewelyn Moss, a thickheaded Texas hunter who stumbles upon some dead bodies in a drug deal gone bad, and with it a huge chunk of change in a bag filled with $2 mill. Could it be no mas overdue credit card charges for Moss? Well, not when you have a no-holds-barred vengeful psycho named Anton Chigurh also in pursuit of the money and will liquidate any 'head or tale' that gets in his way, got it friendo! Town Sheriff Ed Tom Bell realizes the hot water that Moss has gotten into and tries to stop Llewelyn from feeling the Anton wrath. However, Moss' ignorance and stubbornness do become vital deterrents in his seek to take the money and run freely. Will Anton kill Llewelyn? Does Sheriff Bell come to the rescue? Why the Anton 'heads and tales' coin shenanigans in deciding to kill people? I am not going to provide answers to those questions in my review because it will be a 'no country for spoil men' in film reviewing if I spill the T.M.I. beans. I must ground in that 'No Country For Old Men' had a cavalry of country bold acting men. Josh Brolin kept rocking and broling and did not escape 'money acting' as Moss. Tommy Lee Jones was once again in the valley of stellar with his performance. Javier Bardem was a tour-de-force in portraying one of the top antagonist characters of all time in the hardcore ruthless Anton Chigurh. Let's just say that Chigurh caused a lot of chigore in his coined victims. Woody Harrelson, Tess Harper, and Kelly Macdonald also did lasso up some fine supporting work to the country. But back to those little freaky people called the Coen Brothers. Their well-respected sibling talent has brought well-deserved bling bling to the Coen finances. Joel and Ethan's screenplay and directorial configurations of 'No Country For Old Men' proficiently state many beliefs on violence themes from the simpleton law enforcement of the early 1920's to the complex serial killer realities of the latter part of the century. 'No Country For Old Men' is a movie experience that will stay engraved in your cerebral movie land for a long time, so I do highly recommend a viewing. But in the end it is your call, so call it friendo! ***** Excellent",10,0,6,28 January 2008
The Love Guru," There is a lot to hate about The Love Guru!
","'The Love Guru' is a cruel joke on our cinematic society and should be abolished in an executive manner. So I am being a bit of a 'Hate Guru' on my opinions of Mike Myers' profound corny film 'The Love Guru', but it was that repulsive. Myers stars as Guru Pitka, a Love Guru who craves to be the most popular guru in the love universe. His love quest is to reunite an African-American all-star hockey player named Darren Roanoake with his ex-wife Prudence; even though it was not prudent for 'The Love Guru' filmmakers to insert this ridiculous flatline plot line. Roanaoke has been struggling in the hockey rink and the only way to get his 'mojo' back (sound Myersly familiar?) is to get his Prudence back. If Pitka succeeds, then he could be claimed as the 'world's best guru' on Oprah. Are you still with me? Or do I sound like a 'Bore Guru' in describing the atrocious piece of work. Jessica Alba, looking 'albalicious', plays the hockey team owner but her acting here was 'demolicious'. Verne Troyer, Mini-me himself, has a 'small' part as the hockey coach but it would have served him better to be a mini-golf coach instead. Justin Timberlake did not bring his recently impressive acting back playing here a hockey goalie buffoon who is dating dear Prudence. And there is Myers! I did not like Mike here! Myers lost his mojo comedy acting power in 'The Love Guru' by over-exhausting ourselves with way too many puns which most of Pitka's puns were quite pitiful! Even though I might be guilty of the same charge! Director Marco Schnabel and Screenwriters Graham Gordy & Myers himself should quickly visit a 'Film Guru' in order to reconcile with the positive cinema society with their next project. However, I must state that I did enjoy the hilarious elephant sex scene with Chris Isaak's hit song 'Baby Did A Bad, Bad, Thing' playing in the background. But the rest of 'The Love Guru' was no doubt a very bad, bad thing! ** Needs Improvement",Null,0,5,22 November 2008
District 9," District Fine!
","There is a cohesive adjudication by many that Writer-Director's Neil Blomkamp's 'District 9' is the most original film of the year. I think I will also reside in that judgment district. I could 'yada yada' about how much I enjoyed this film, but there is no experience like visiting 'District 9' yourself to get the real zest of the movie. Many of you have inhabited the plot of 'District 9'= Twenty years ago, an Extraterrestrial race made their way to Johannesburg, and consequently are forced to live in a slum area in the city called District 9; all while their massive standstill spaceship occupies the Johannesburg sky above. Twenty years later, a munitions corporation called Multi National United (MNU) is contracted to forcibly evict the aliens (which they call Spawns) of District 9 and use them for weaponry experimental purposes. They delegate the clumsy operative Wilkus Van De Merwe to head the mission. Even though at first, Van De Merwe is doing a 'gran de mierda' job with the mission, he turns out to be a very engaging hero whose broad personality & antics does wonders to the film's success. Sharlto Copley's dynamic starring performance as the resilient Wilkus was definitely not one of charlatan material. I can't cope with the fact that Copley was not nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award. The aliens (spawns) of 'District 9' were also (how can I put this?)¬Ö Far Out!!! Christopher Johnson is the premier spawn character in the film which might or might not have the long searching fluid for the aliens to be able to disembark the slums and return home. In other words, Chris Johnson wants to be the main Spawn Titan to get them out of there. Oops! Wrong Chris Johnson! Blomkamp's outlandish direction and imaginative scribe of 'District 9' were one of the elites of the year. I think many Hollywood studios will be 'kamping' out for Blomkamp's services for some time to come. Some other film-making experts of 'District 9' also contributed to its highly-legal grand cinematic residency: Emilia Roux's art direction, Julian Clarke's editing, Clinton Shorter's score, Trent Opaloch's cinematography, and the entire makeup & special effects crews. So make your way to 'District 9' and see Wilkus & the Slumprawn Alienaires duke it out with the nasty (it's not all about) the MNU. ***** Excellent",9,0,3,3 February 2010
Mamma Mia!," Do not take a chance on this one!
","ABBA, Abbacadraba, I want to reach out and grab you! Why? In vengeance for the cinematic torture you put me through in experiencing the film adaption of the ABBA inspired musical 'Mamma Mia'. This asinine film stars Meryl Streep as Donna Sheridan, a rundown Greek hotel owner whose daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is planning her upcoming nuptials in the Greek island. The primary 'Who is my real Pappa?' premise of this film is that Sophie was never informed by Mamadonna who her real father is, even though there are three main candidates who Mamadonna went over the sexual borderline with twenty years ago. Sophie's choice then is to invite all three to the wedding so she can finally have 'faith' to know the 'father figure' truth. These Sophie Daddy nominees are the 'I still love Donna even though I dumped her after I did her' Sam, the former hippie but now stable banker Harry, and the free spirit boat-aficionado Bill. Along for the wedding ride are also Donna's best friends: the lunatic Rosie, and the middle-aged lush Tanya. Throughout all this 'Who is your daddy?' humdrum plot there are spurts of these characters singing away to ABBA tunes. All I can say is, to quote a classic ABBA hit- 'Gimme Gimme Gimme' less of these ridiculous musical scenes; even though Meryl Streep's pipes were not as bad as I thought coming from a seasoned actress. I cannot say the same for The Three Dads who were Pierce Brosnan as Sam, Colin Firth as Harry, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bill. Brosnan was the main singing daddy here and his musical voice was undoubtedly both shaken & stirred. Let's just say that Brosnan's singing was 'The Matador' to my ears. The ensemble acting of 'Mamma Mia' was appalling but the 'main weapons of acting destruction' were found in the performances of Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya. Catherine Johnson's screenplay of 'Mamma Mia' was dreary & wearisome, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction was as clumsy as direction can get. Harris Zambarloukos' unauthentic cinematography seemed like he used a Greece Photoshop software program for the film's look. So to cap this monstrosity of a film in musical fashion, I will use an ABBA tune: Do not 'take a chance' on the musical horror of 'Mamma Mia'. *Failure",1,7,11,22 November 2009
Tigerland," This One Roars!
","`Tigerland' is probably one of the best military films that no one has seen. I was surprised and glad to see that big budget director Joel Schumacher had the courage to instead make a small low-budget film with unknown actors about a military training camp that prepared privates for the vietnam war. But I guess those Joels do surprise you from time to time? Anywayyyyyys, the film's acting was fantastic especially stars Colin Farrell and Matthew Davis. To quote the great Tony the Tiger, ` They were greeeeeeeeeeaaaaaattttt! ' The precise direction and screenplay of the film should also `spot' your eyes. `Tigerland' is definitely one attraction that you should not miss. **** Good",8,0,1,1 August 2001
Batman Begins," Nolan knows his superhero stuff
","Christopher Nolan directorially batted well enough to save the 'Batman' film franchise from production disqualification and audience desensitization. Nolan, who helmed the cerebral masterpiece 'Memento', goes on a Batman storytelling crusade by depicting the methodology of why a wealthy orphan named Bruce Wayne became a caped crusader nicknamed Batman. It details his childhood, bat-phobia, imprisonment, seclusion, transformation, and heroism. Yea I guess 'Wayne's World' is a bit complex, melancholy, and nocturnal but there is no doubt that his 'bat'teries are always charged up when predicaments arise. Christian Bale stars as our murky superhero and it was obvious to analyze that the 'Good Christian' did not just 'wing' his performance. Bale must have prepared intensely: physically, mentally, and even spiritually; just like 'Batman' himself. The grand Michael Caine revitalizes the character of the butler/caretaker Alfred with wittiness, buttress, and craftiness. Cilian Murphy found enough brain to play a Batman nemesis nicknamed Scarecrow with wizardry. However, the rest of the 'Batman Begins' cast were not thespian superfriends to the narrative. Liam Neeson falls once again to stereotype casting by playing Henri Ducard, Batman's tutor and eventually his foe. Didn't he play this role already like in around 30 other films? Morgan Freeman was miscast as Lucius Fox, a veteran engineer which eventually becomes Batman's Costume Designer and Art Director. Katie Homes did not 'cruise' on her way in playing Rachel Dawes, a District Attorney who also moonlights as Bruce Wayne's childhood friend and admirer. Ken Watanabe was impressive as Batman's major nemesis Ra's Al Ghul but his minimal screen time did not give Ra enough raw footage. The primary positive bite of 'Batman Begins' is that it is a Christopher Nolan film and the eccentricities he injects to his films (unpredictable conflicts, multifarious situations, and non-linear storytelling) are profound enough to resurrect Batman from the dark side of film franchises. **** Good",8,0,0,31 March 2006
The Fault in Our Stars," Not faulty at all!
","There are not too many faults in the emotional 'The Fault in Our Stars'. The movie is centered around Hazel and Augustus, two teenagers with cancer who form an exceptional friendship and romance. It is based on John Green's best-selling book which made plenty of green in the literary world. The ascending Shailene Woodley marvels again with another solid performance, here as Hazel; Shailene fortunately has not diverted herself into the poisons of Hollywood demise. Newcomer Anton Elgort is an unfaulty star-in-the-making with his work here as Augustus. And I also thought Willem Dafoe was stellar as novelist Van Houten; but a Dafoe performance is usually outstanding just at default. Josh Boone's direction of the film was authentic as he did not convert 'The Fault in Our Stars' into a weepy Lifetime movie by incorporating a myriad of themes in the picture. I loved how love for a novel became a potent point in the movie; yes, I even read into that. Sure, this type of film will bring the handkerchiefs and kleenexes out, but I refuse to call 'The Fault in Our Stars' a tearjerker. I rather describe it as a strong movie about the power of love; and maybe I am reaching for the stars, but last I checked, there is no fault in that. ***** Excellent",9,1,2,11 March 2015
To Rome With Love," I do not love 'To Rome with Love', even though its not a 'To Rome with Hate' for me
","I loved Woody Allen's Paris, but was definitely disappointed with Woody Allen's Rome. For the most part, 'To Rome with Love' lacked creativity, inventiveness, and appeal. Unlike Woody's wondrous 'Midnight in Paris' which was both a love letter to a divine city and also a captivating narrative, 'To Rome With Love' was just simply the former and lacking the latter. Now, I did enjoy some facets of 'To Rome with Love' but like my personal European trips, they were far and few in between. Woody seemed rushed in constructing the movie, it was like he was trying to build Rome in one day. The film features several story lines set in the titular city, some with natives and some with tourists. We start the Rome adventure with a trip to Haley's Comet, which would be the young American Haley who travels to Rome in an excursion. Haley falls in love with the Italian Michelangelo (no, not that Michelangelo, this is not 'Midnight in Rome') and therefore since it is a romance in the most romantic city in the world, they get engaged. Haley's American parents Jerry and Phyllis visit Rome to meet Michelangelo and his parents. Jerry is played by none other than Woody himself, and Phyllis is portrayed by Judy Davis. Jerry, who is a retired Opera Director, notices that Michelangelo's dad has a brilliant opera singing voice when he hears him singing in the shower; so therefore Jerry decides to try to ride that ticket to a return to Opera glory even though Michelangelo and his mother are totally against it. Let's just say this storyline was not showered with magnetism. It was great to see Davis in an Allen film again, being a veteran of so many Woodyflicks. And Woody was just being Woody with another neurosis-filled performance. Allison Pill turned out a solid performance as Haley. I want to say so much on the promise of Allison's acting career, but I decided to take a chill pill and move on to our next stop in our Rome film review excursion. That would include the beautiful return of Roberto Benigni (remember him?) as the Italian family man Leopoldo who obtains instant stardom when he inadvertently becomes a Reality Star phenomenon, and gets plummeted with press observing every move he makes during the day. Allen is obviously depicting the unauthentic aspects of Reality Show fame, but the joke starts wearing thin at times even though Benigni portrays it with precision. Moving right along to our next Rome storyline, there is a story that was prostituted for cheesy laughs. And that would be of a young Italian married couple Antonio and Milly who visit Rome to meet Antonio's uncles but a series of events lead Antonio and Milly to separate Romeatic adventures including Antonio having a bombshell Italian prostitute named Anna pretend that she is his wife for reasons that would take too much time and energy to explain. Besides that, the story was not funny; but Penelope Cruz did look ravishing even though her performance was overacted and not even in the same ball park as her Oscar-winning performance in Allen's 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. And our last stop in 'To Rome with Love' was the most entertaining narrative of the movie. It includes Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, and Alec Baldwin. Eisenberg plays Jack, an architect student living abroad in Rome with his American girlfriend Sally, that girl is portrayed by Gerwig. Jack meets the effervescent middle-aged John (Alec Baldwin), who when he was Jack's age also studied architecture in Rome. John becomes like a guiding force and voice of reason or unreason to Jack by giving him advice on a dilemma that occurs when Sally's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) visits Jack and Sally. Monica is cerebral, analytical, and chatty which are all attributes that attract Jack to her. So where they be a m√©nage a trios as the Romans do?, o wait that is the French. Baldwin nailed the John performance, and is worthy enough of a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Ellen Page has just turned another page in her impressive young acting career with another fine-tuned performance. I do have to credit Allen for scribing a very witty screenplay within this storyline, but this is the only one that did it for me. Allen does show breathtaking scenes of Rome that brilliantly captures the beauty and romance of the beloved city, but that was not even enough for me to unanimously recommend this movie. 'To Rome with Love' is not a total disaster, and it does have numerous good things in it, but if I were you I would not spend too many Romeing charges on it. *** Average",7,2,7,9 July 2012
Bridesmaids," Here comes the 'Bridesmaids', all dressed in just alright
","I am sorry to separate myself from most of the moviegoer audience, but I just did not feel the love of 'Bridesmaids' and think it's the most overrated movie of the year. Now, don't get me wrong, I did not mind walking down the cinematic aisle with a viewing of 'Bridesmaids'. It did have its share of shits and giggles, especially the former in a most- talked about bridal dress shop scene. But the movie has been hailed as the top comedy of 2011 by many film critics, and I just don't think it deserves that ring of honor. 'Bridesmaids' stars the always enigmatic Kristen Wiig as Annie, yea she is a bridesmaid and also the maid of honor of her best gal pal Lilian played by Maya Rudolph. Annie is intimidated by Lilian's new close friend Helen (Rose Byrne) who is an egocentric socialite who will stop at nothing to be Lilian's new best friend and dethrone Annie from that classification. Sounds like silly teenage girls battling for a 'best friend' confirmation, doesn't it? Well, that is pretty much how it is in 'Bridesmaids'. Now, that is not what 'Bridesmaids' is all about. There is the rest of Lilian's bridesmaids entourage- the bored housewife Rita (Wendi McClendon-Covey), the adventure-seeker Becca (Ellie Kemper), and the zany Megan (Melissa McCarthy). Director Paul Feig dresses up 'Bridesmaids' with many aspects that have already been addressed in other chick-flick movies; the jealous friend, the villainous socialite, the crazy obese character, and the formulaic rom-com storyline. The primary romantic storyline in the movie is of Annie and police officer Nathan Rhodes. They are opposites that are destined to be together; and their boy-gets-girl, girl-loses- boy, girl-desperately tries to get boy again-in movie's final scene is a narrative feature that has been exposed way too many times in this genre. Sure, I am speaking now to forever hold this piece on what is awry of 'Bridesmaids', but there was some positive uniformity in the film. Kirsten Wiig was very good as Annie, and the Annie protagonist is what made me want to hold on to 'Bridesmaids' as much as I can. Wiig continues to get 'wiiigy with it' as one of the best female comedic actresses in today's Hollywood. Chris O'Dowd no doubt was arrestingly charismatic as the witty-liner Officer Dowd. And it was very joyous, even though a bit heartbreaking, to see legendary actress Jill Clayburgh in her final performance as Annie's mom. Clayburgh passed away a few months ago. Wiig and Annie Mumolo scripted up the 'Bridesmaids' screenplay with some funny lines, but not enough in the 'laugh out loud' department. A lot has been talked about new comedy queen Melissa McCarthy's performance as the madcap Megan, now it was good but not to the level of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination as it has been buzzed around. Megan sure did a bit of scene-stealing in 'Bridesmaids' but I think it does have a bit of Alan-takeoff in them. You don't know what I am referring to, stream or Netflix 'The Hangover' and 'The Hangover Part 2', which it would be an exercise of futility because chances are you already saw them. Jon Hamm's performance as a womanizer who uses Annie for sex is one of the most pointless performances of the year, Hamm is a good actor and I don't want him to be a mad man towards me for my comments but his talents were wasted here. 'Bridesmaids' is a recommendable feature, but there is not enough colorful-movie coordination for it to be proclaimed as a comedic classic. *** Average",7,0,2,25 November 2011

OK, let the focker pun games begin! 'Meet the Fockers' has already met the dollars by striking box office bonanza. This sequel contains the same focking humor as its predecessor 'Meet the Parents'.

Before Sunset," A Beautiful Cinematic Sunset View!
","It dawned at me many years ago that the 1995 Richard Linklater film 'Before Sunrise' was one of the supreme bang-up romantic narratives in cinematic history; even though the main characters are not showed banging. 'Before Sunrise' tells the story of Jessie & Celine's one-day romance in Vienna. Jessie is the American and Celine is the Frenchie. They were young, vulnerable, and adventurous. The film's open-ended finale left us pondering if they would reunite in 6 months. Before you know it, 9 years have passed. So you know what that means, Sequel Heaven! Jessie & Celine are now Sunset People! Doing it right! Night after night! OK, Summer's over! Donna Summer, that is. 'Before Sunset' is one of the best sequels ever! I know some of you think that my brain is fried by getting too much sun with this overstatement. However, you have to experience this breathtaking sunset to believe it. In 'Sunset', Jessie & Celine unexpectedly reunite in Paris nine years later. They're older, wiser, and more experienced in the game of love. Will they recapture the magic in this 'Sunset Place'? If you are an avid fan of 'Sunrise', then you will adore the 'Sunset' even more. The film's poetic masterful screenplay is quite deserving of its Academy Award nomination; which by the way was scribed by Linklater, Jessie, and Celine. Yes! Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Their acting was also not too shabby. Ethan Hawke as Jessie and Julie Delpy as Celine were commanding thespian performances that were definitely on the sunny-side up category. Without a doubt, the best acting duet of the year! Reunited and it felt so good to see Hawke and Delpy on screen together again. I announce in my delpysition that Delpy's work might very well be the best female acting of 2004. So much so, that I desperately wish I had 'Jessie's Girl'. Writer-Director Linklater's work never ceases to surprise me. He is one of the genius directors of our generation.

Non-Stop," Non-Stop fun!
","The flight thriller 'Non-Stop' sure has its turbulent silliness and unauthenticated features, but it still aired out its downright thrilling popcorn entertainment. Liam Neeson stars as Air Marshall Bill Marks who is pretty much a marked man in a transatlantic flight. There is an anonymous passenger on board who threatens to start killing the passengers if a large sum of money is not deposited into an account. Marks then pilots into action to save the day. Sure, you could call this flick 'Taken on a Plane', but somehow this one worked for me. Director Jaume Collet-Sera steered the movie with intensity which kept me on the edge of my seat; so que Sera, Sera. The script sure had its flaws, but who cares; this is not a movie that flies on dialogue. Neeson was tough as nails as Marks. A underutilized Julianne Moore flies coach in this one with a supporting role as a female passenger who inadvertently gets caught up in the action; sure one always wants more from Moore, but it seems like she was just flying high and having fun with this role. ' Non-Stop' is not a showstopper of a flick, but it won't give you much of a red eye of boredom. So hop on this cinematic flight and have fun with it. **** Good",8,1,2,29 June 2015
The Pianist," Good Tune!
","present you my report card for Director Roman Polanski's biographical holocaust film 'The Pianist' starring Adrien Brody as a Polish Jewish piano man experiencing Holocaust horrors:Subject: Directing Piano Key Grade: 'A minor' Roman Polanski deserves an 'A minor' for his masterful direction. He was very pragmatic in displaying violent Holocaust sequences that were frightening, but yet, historically imperative to observe. Polanski himself is considered a fugitive for fleeting the United States 20 years ago after being convicted of performing underage sex with a minor. Roman, congratulations on the critical acclaim that 'The Pianist' has received. I just hope that the next film installments of 'Child's Play' & 'The Fugitive' are not in your Director wish list. Subject: Acting Piano Key Grade: 'A minor' 'A' is for Adrien! Adrien's Brody tour-de-force performance as Polish piano legend Wladyslaw Szpilman proved that Brody is no 'peeonist' in the movie business. His subtle facial gestures while witnessing holocaust events were astonishing to observe. Yo Adrien: You played a brilliant tune of acting. However, the rest of the cast of 'The Pianist' was a bit off-key.
Subject: Sound Piano Key Grade: 'D minor' The sound of 'The Pianist' was muzzled and undeterminable. The sound editors should have tweaked their cinematic instruments more efficiently.
Subject: Screenplay Piano key grade: 'C minor' 'The Pianist' screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. I think Academy voters should play that 'Pianist' piece again, and notice that it is not deserving of a nomination. Its dialogue was stale and clumsy.

The Grand Budapest Hotel," No boos in this Wes Budapest creation!
","'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is more of the unique craftsmanship of Writer-Director Wes Anderson, which many Wild Wes Wes Lovers will adore. The movie stars Ralph Fiennes in an excellent performance as Hotel Concierge M. Gustave of the titular hotel. Gustave is a suave concierge with his ways of romancing geriatric women heiress who stay in his hotel. One of them would be Madame D, who dies and leaves Gustave a priceless painting in her will and testimony. Madame D's ferocious sons have another plan in mind to relinquish Gustave of the painting. Gustave confides in a young lobby boy named Zero, who saves Gustave out of many near brushes with death & disaster; maybe Anderson should have shown Gustave singing The FIxx 80's tune 'Saved by Zero' in one of the film's scenes. As in any Wes cinematic offering, there is much quirkiness involved in the film's scenes and characters. But as much as I enjoyed the film's creative ways, I do not think 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' resides in the presidential suite of the greatest independent movie comedies of all-time even though it did have some elements of a first-class stay; which included Fiennes' grand work as Gustave, and other grand thespian works coming from F. Murray Abraham as the older Zero, Jeff Goldblum as Deputy Kovacs, and even the young Zero himself played by newcomer Tony Revolori who is quite a revelation in this picture. Anderson should be credited with another worthy idiosyncratic screenplay and direction of an independent movie. In all, I do think you should check-in and check out 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. And for those of you who did not like this review, just please 'get your hands off my copy boy', it was not his fault. **** Good",8,0,6,6 April 2014
Seabiscuit," Spectacular Bid to watch this film!
","Many filmgoers are fetching on to the biscuit!  That is the horse race film `Seabiscuit'. It is quickly becoming one of the top DVD sellers of all time! Yes folks! I am not horsing around! Tobey Maguire, who himself is a jockey-of-all-trades I mean jack-of-all-trades actor, reached new heights by superbly playing rangy jockey Red Pollard. This motion picture is based on the triumphant true story of an undersized racehorse named Seabiscuit who touched the hearts of Americans during The Great Depression. The film also centers on Seabiscuit's impact on two other prominent figures: Horseowner Charles Howard & Trainer Tom Smith. Jeff Bridges' commanding & endearing performance as Howard will not burn any bridges. It hits high on the gallup poll. Chris Cooper's work as Smith was admirable but it did not adapt to the beautiful supporting work he contributed in `American beauty' & `Adaptation'. Gary Ross' spectacular direction was a winning run in the day of the Rosses, I mean roses. Ok! I will cut these horseplay puns. Seabiscuit's aggressive stretch marketing run prevailed it to a Best Picture Academy nomination.

Revolutionary Road," Mendes mending more marriage hearts but with a slick revolutionary style!
","Director Sam Mendes' suburbia melancholy tic is still ticking with his latest subversive (synonym of revolutionary) film 'Revolutionary Road'. The film is not really a revolutionist one as it is a sinister one; sinister in the sense of marriage peccadillo. Mendes brings us the usual no-no's of marriage that have been mores in the matrimony world in the last few decades: adultery, deceit, lies, dissatisfaction, and escapism. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet star as Frank & April Wheeler, a young married couple with two kids living in a Connecticut suburb in the mid 1950's. Frank Wheeler unenthusiastically just goes with the motion in his mundane office job living paycheck by paycheck. April Wheeler is a stay-at-home mom and part-time amateur actress who longs for more than the life she is living. Therefore, a Wheeler Revolution must occur! So they decide to move to Paris. They inform their archetypal suburban married neighbors (and best friends) Shep and Milly Campbell of their Tour de France plans; The Campbells think it is all talk soup, even with their stunned expressions. That scene is probably the elite one the film. The Wheeler's revolutionary Paris road plans come to a dead end when Frank gets an unexpected promotion and the zenith of the Wheeler Marriage Civil War begins. 'Revolutionary Road' should not be part of an itinerary for a Marriage Retreat because most of the film shows the Wheelers emotionally bickering about various contrived sentiments and psychological conflicts. DiCaprio and Winslet's titanic performances are Oscar worthy; but Winslet wins out between the two. Nevertheless, my favorite performance of the film was Michael Shannon's scene-stealing work as John Gibins, the mentally troubled son of the Wheeler's real estate confidante Helen Gibins. Shannon portrays John Gibins as a real straight shooter who fires emotional verbal blows to the Wheelers which get them off track in saving their marriage. I hope the Academy does shadow my Shannon sentiment by giving him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kathy Bates is 'gibin' us some more fine acting in the twilight of her career with her solid work as Helen Gibins. Justin Haythe's screenplay based on Richard Yates 'Revolutionary Road' novel gives the best-seller literary work a respectful proper credence. You gotta have Haythe in your promising screenwriter list. Roger Deakins' astounding cinematography should garner him yet another Oscar nomination; copy that Roger. But let's divert back to Sam the Man! Mendes, Mr. Kate Winslet himself, admirably continues to direct stories on marriage tribulations that cause eventual destruction on many psychological effects on a couple and those close around. He did it proficiently with 'American Beauty' and does an encore with it in 'Revolutionary Road'; even though I thought Beauty was superior to Road. When you first cinematically drive through 'Revolutionary Road' it seems like just a mediocre movie ride; but before you could say 'mental revolution' it does linger in your mind for a few days and that is a prominent sign of a powerful film. Follow your movie G.P.S. and take a ride through 'Revolutionary Road'. **** Good",8,1,3,17 January 2009
Foxcatcher," What a fox!
","Right after I finished watching the gripping 'Foxcatcher', I wrestled with the idea that it was a masterpiece. Well, maybe it's not a masterpiece, but it is really quite good. 'Foxcatcher' is based on the true story of wrestling Olympic Champion brothers Mark & David Schultz, who joined Team Foxcatcher led & financed by multi-millionaire John Du Pont. Du Pont sees some chemistry in having the gullible Mark join his team. And then eventually the more stoic Dave joins the Foxcatching crew. The tragedy within this story is that the deranged Du Pont ended up murdering Dave Schultz; that was not a spoiler, its a true story so if you can't wrestle with that concept, don't blame me. Director Bennett Miller paints 'Foxcatcher' as an icy psychothriller; which was fair enough due to its subject matter. Miller has proved again that when it's Miller time, the movies are not less filling. Steve Carrell's performance as Du Pont was a creepy of a performance you will see, but it was also quite brilliant. Channing Tatum delivers his best work in his career in his portrayal of Mark Schultz. And Mark Ruffalo keeps up his impressive thespian filmography with another worthy performance, here playing Dave Schultz. 'Foxcatcher 'is not the feel good movie of the year, but its power is sturdy.

","`28 days later' is being hailed as the independent box office champ of the year. This is Bullocks! Bullocks! Bullocks! And I am not referring to the star of the similar titled but dissimilar theme film `28 Days'. However, I must say that the critics who have praised the apocalyptic   `28 Days Later' must go into rehab for at least 28 days (Yes! I know wrong 28 Days film again). This atrocious film is about a British man who discovers that the entire human civilization has been inflicted with a deadly plague is about the most horrific film I have seen in a long time. When I mean horrific I mean horrible! The ridicule continues when our main protagonist discovers that the inflicted humans now are killer zombies. I do not know if it took 28 seconds or 28 minutes before I discovered that `28 Days Later' will definitely fall in the list of one of the worst 28 films I have ever seen. I can give you a another 28 reasons why this movie is so bad but I will spare you the killer list.  Say later days to `28 Days Later'! * Failure",Null,2,3,22 January 2004
It Follows," Follow through this one!
","'It Follows'! Yes, it does! My grandiose corny puns in my movie reviews, and this one is no different! OK, OK. Please don't leave and I beg you to continue to follow me in my review of the horror independent flick 'It Follows'. Writer-Director David Robert Mitchell has formulated a very inventive horror movie about an unknown supernatural force that follows some of those who have sexual encounters. Our protagonist here is the blonde beauty Jay Height. Jay reaches her own new heights when she starts dating the all-American sporto Hugh. But Hugh will not guess what happens with that encounter, because then if I spill the beans, it will be a Hugh disappointment, and spoilers will follow. Sorry, but I can't resist. Hugh ends up giving Jay the supernatural force that causes weary characters to slowly follow; hence 'It Follows'. It might sound like 'It Follows' is not it, but it is actually a very engaging movie, that does not mimic most of the formulaic hum-drum horror movies of these days. And it does have its scary moments, including a breakthrough beginning. So I think we should start following the career of David Robert Mitchell because he was it in crafting this feature. I also liked the leading performance of Maika Monroe as Jay. The rest of the cast was moderate but nothing to follow through profusely. OK, that is pretty much it. Now follow 'It Follows'. **** Good",8,1,1,26 April 2017
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," A short Serkis saves this movie from disaster! Caesar rules!
","I am sorry, but I did not go ape crazy with cinematic ecstasy with my 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' viewing experience as many moviegoers and numerous critics did. This movie is a prequel to the 'Planet of the Apes' and it reveals the genesis of how the apes went ballistic and eventually wiped out the entire human race. And to think it all started in times of Caesar. More on that in just a sec¬Ö 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' stars James Franco as Will Rodman, a scientist who vehemently tries to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease which his father Charles suffers from. Will tests out an Alzheimer experimental drug on chimpanzees in the lab he works with; when that experiment goes ape crazy, he has no choice but to go back to square one and do a Huey Lewis, 'I Want A New Drug'. Will takes in Caesar, a baby chimp who eventually gets older and gathers humanlike intelligence from the experimental drug's effect; which also help cure Will's father Charles from Alzheimer. When a bullying neighbor tries to hurt Charles outside Caesar's Palace (that would be the Rodman home), Caesar goes bezerk and almost kills the neighbor. Consequently, Caesar is court ordered to an ape sanctuary. What follows is a sort of an ape prison escape type of situation led by a very angry Caesar. Director Rupert Wyatt does a credible job with the action ape sequences of the film, but lays flat when it came to the humans. None of the humans were engaging at all, and it did not help that they had nothing fascinating to say thanks to Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver's humdrum screenplay. Franco looked bored playing Will Rodman, maybe he would have had more fun if he was playing Dennis Rodman. Freida Pinto's performance as primatologist and Will's love interest Caroline Aranha served hardly any purpose in the movie and was just thrown in there for eye candy pinta when seeing the gorgeous Pinto. John Lithgow was OK, but not vintage Lithgow with his performance as Charles. The thespian who stole this show is no doubt Andy Serkis, the performance-capture master who once again showed he is the Lord of the Walking Things with his work as Caesar. His Serkis continues to be the Greatest Show on Earth in the performance-capture movie arena. Another positive rise of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' was its breathtaking visual effects; I do visualize that it just might take the Best Visual Effects Academy Award. 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes' is a cinematic planet worth visiting primarily due to the Serkis ride of Caesar the primate. *** Average",7,1,2,27 January 2012
City of God," Oh my God! This movie was amazing!
","`City of God' is a Brazilian cinematic masterpiece.  Thank God that it has been nominated for 4 academy awards. Director Fernando Meirelles mesmerizing look at teenage ganglords in a Brazilian slum-town nicknamed the City of God is one of the best crime films of all time. Hey! I know this might be an overstatement so please do not gang up on me. The film is narrated by the reticent teenager named Rocket who lives in the `city of god' but is not a hoodlum himself. However, he is surrounded by a life of crime & violence that commands this ghetto. The teenage ganglords control the city of god and there is minimal police intervention. Hey, why not start a Youth Crime Watch program? I had to shoot that one in there (shameless promotion). Alexandre Rodrigue as Rocket sparks up an astronomical performance. However, the most puissant performance of the film is delivered by Leandro Firmino as the menacing youth gang-leader Lil'Ze. His killing-spree ruthless demeanor makes him the most intimidating character I have seen in film this year. Among the aforementioned, other godlike attributes in the `City of God' is the amplitude that Meirelles inserts in its screenplay & narrative.  The film is based on accounts of a true story and Meirelles & Screnwriter Paulo Lins are most credible in keeping it Rio, I mean real. `City of God' is magisterial but yet disturbing. Nevertheless, it should be blessed as one of the best foreign films in history. ***** Excellent",10,1,4,27 February 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Tigers Roars At Times But Mostly Bites!
","I think that the critics that have selected `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' as one of the best films of the year are a bunch of kung fools. This overrated film about a missing sword and its struggle to get it back does not kick ass, contrary to popular belief. Superior chinese epics in the past have made me `Enter The Dragon' and even go back once more and `Return To The Dragon.' However, this one made me `hide forever from the dragon.' Listen, I am not being a big crouch or should I say grouch. I do have to bow my head to the spectacular fight scenes wonderfully directed by Ang Lee.

Beasts of No Nation," Beastly for the most part!
","Writer-Director Cary Joji Fukunaga, the acclaimed director of the 'True Detective' series, has demonstrated that he could be a beast in Hollywood director nation with his latest gripping movie 'Beasts of No Nation'. The film stars child actor Abraham Attah as Agu, a child whose family is murdered by an oppressed army of an unnamed African country. Agu is then sort of rescued by a rebellious group led by the domineering commander subtly named Commandant played fiercely by Idris Elba. Agu then transforms himself into a child soldier and is forced to kill many by the Commandant. That is a killer childhood no child should experience. Funkunaga transports us into a brutal African society where survival is just the matter of life, and rebellion forces becomes an unwelcome necessity. My only flaw of 'Beast of No Nation' is that it was maybe twenty minutes too long. But the beastly performances from Attah and Elba more than make up for that matter. 'Beasts of No Nation' is not the feel good movie of the year, but it just might be the feel important movie of the year. **** Good",8,4,6,28 November 2015
Gone Girl," Gone but not forgotten! Great flick!
","David Fincher's 'Gone Girl' wont disappear too much during movie awards season and box office fare because of its critical & commercial success. It is a prototype fine Fincher film. The flick stars Ben Affleck as Nick Dunne, a writer who has fallen on hard economic times, but wait I am not Dunne yet. Nick also discovers on the day of his anniversary that his wife Amy is missing. Amy is also a writer who was famed for writing an 'Amazing Amy' novel series. Nick turns out to be a suspect of his missing wife. But I won't reveal much more about the plot because then I will have lots of gone girls and boys from reading the rest of my review. Affleck holds game in his starring performance as Nick, but it was Rosamund Pike who reached a new peak in her promising acting career with her outstanding performance as Amy; it will be amazing if she gets nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, which surely is a shoe-in to happen. Believe it or not, Tyler Perry does not bolt it away and does credible supporting work as Nick's attorney Tanner Bolt. Neil Patrick Harris is hosting the Oscars, and also hosted us to a worthy supporting performance as Amy's obsessed ex Desi. Carrie Coon also delivered a cool Coon performance as Nick's sister Margo. Fincher's exemplary direction was not gone from this picture, and Gillian Flynn was in in her impressive screenplay adaption of her own 'Gone Girl' novel. OK, I am about gone here. Just see 'Gone Girl' if you haven't already. **** Excellent",9,0,4,15 December 2014
Django Unchained," Do the Django and watch this Tarantino instant classic!
","DMeeza (and yes, the 'D' is silent) is about to write a review of one his favorite movies of 2012, 'Django Unchained'. Quentin Tarantino returns with another immensely entertaining 'history rewrite' film with the Django. This spaghetti-western movie stars Jamie Foxx as Django, a black slave who is confronted by a Dentist turned Bounty Hunter named Dr. King Schultz in order to help him locate some outlaws who are next on Dr. Shultz' Bounty hit list. Dr. Shultz takes a liking to Django's bravado & demeanor and eventually they team up as Bounty partners. Django's ultimate desire is to reunite with his slave wife Broomhilda who was sold to the Candieland plantation in Mississippi. Candieland is owned by the condescending Calvin Candie, who thrives in watching slaves fight to the death in a Mandingo sport. Dr. Shultz makes a king move in helping Django reunite with his wife; his plan is to go to Candieland and for him and Django to pretend to be Mandingo aficionados in order to scheme a method to buy off Broomhilda from Calvin Candie. Of course, there is always plenty of grotesque violence, boisterous mayhem, and witty dialogue in a Tarantino flick and fortunately that is also in the menu of this spaghetti western Quentin has delighted us with; his films are in a genre of their own. Quentin is worthy of screenplay & director Oscar nominations for his ingenious 'off the chain' orchestration and scribe of 'Django Unchained'. Foxx was one cool black cat as Django. Christoph Waltz' performance as Dr. King Schultz was just as juicy as his Oscar-winning work in Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds', but with a heroic quality to it. Leonardo DiCaprio's first premier villainous role in his performance as Calvin Candie proves that Leo is just as good playing bad as he is playing good. Tarantino favorite Samuel L. Jackson served up a meaty performance as Candie's main butler Stephen, who was just as villainous maybe even more than Candie himself; and he is black. Don Johnson delivered a vice mac-daddy cameo performance playing the negro-hating plantation owner Big Daddy. And even though she was a bit underutilized, Kerry Washington swept it up nicely thespian style as Broomhilda. 'Django Unchained' was a chain of exemplary film-making and acting that deserves a chain reaction of praise. ***** Excellent",10,3,12,27 December 2012
Get Out," Get Out!!! That good, ha! Yes, sireeee!
","Writer-Director Jordan Peele has just made a mark as another Great Jordan! Peele's masterful orchestration (directorial and scribe like) of his movie 'Get Out' will probably be getting in my future 'Top 10 Movies of 2017' list. This horror/comedy/drama/unique movie stars Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams as Chris Washington and Rose Armitage. Chris and Rose are a biracial couple (Chris being black, Rose being white) who go on a trip to suburbia so Chris can meet Rose's parents; but 'Meet the Parents' this is not. There Chris sees himself in a plethora of surreal & strange situations, which I won't divulge because I don't want you to 'get out' of reading my review if I reveal spoilers. Peele not only presents the narrative as unpredictable, perplexing, and magnetic, but he also incorporates various social themes on class distinctions within the picture. A big Kaluuya shot, I mean Kaluuya shout-out goes to Daniel for his excellent performance as Chris. Williams also delivered as Rose. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener nailed their performances as Rose's parents, Dean and Missy. I was especially hypnotized with Keener's work. Other phenom supporting work was gotten out of Caleb Landry Jones as Rose's brother Jeremy; and Betty Gabriel as Georgina, the Armitage's housekeeper. Not its time for you to stop reading this, and get out and experience 'Get Out. ***** Excellent",10,8,16,7 July 2017
Drive," An unforgettable Drive!
","I am going to quickly put it in first gear and off-the-bat mention that Director Nicholas Winding Refn's 'Drive' is sure to be the #1 badass movie of 2011. OK, maybe many of you reading this feel that I put it in overdrive with that statement, but you have to trust me on this one. Ryan Gosling stars as (he pulled one out of Clint Eastwood's 'man with no name' spaghetti westerns) because his name is never mentioned throughout the movie, he is just simply Driver. How cool is that? Driver is an orthodontist, brace yourself. OK, so he is not. Helloo! What do you think he is! Ryan Seacrest eat your heart out because Driver has more Hollywood gigs than you. Driver is a Hollywood stunt driver for movies, a mechanic at an L.A. body shop, and a contract driver for thieves on their robbery hits. He is tacit, conscious, and of course driven. He befriends a cutesy apartment neighbor Irene and her son Benicio. When Irene's husband Standard returns from a prison sentence and hires Driver for a forced robbery , 'Drive' is taken to another gear altogether, and shifts more to an ultra-violence speed. The Standard operation heads to a dead-end zone and that is when 'Drive' moves up to top cool control. Refn's mastery of the movie's guise, unpredictability, and stylishness are key factors why this movie rocks! Refn is very deserving of a Best Director Oscar nomination. I will be refn mad if that does not happens! Hossein Amini's staid screenplay is limited in wordage but unlimited in deftness. Gosling does not take a back seat to anyone with his stellar starring performance. 2011 is looking like the year of the Gosling, so I think he is on the right route for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Carey Mulligan was solid as Irene. Albert Brooks delivers a menacing performance as the antagonist Bernie Rose. Looks like Brooks' comeback is heading in the right direction. Give The Brooks a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nom! Some other nice turns were thespianly delivered in 'Drive' by Bryan Cranston as body shop owner Shannon, Oscar Issac as Standard, and Ron Perlman as Rose's partner Nino. Cliff Martinez's perfect score was musically 'up to speed' with the film's pace. So go and drive to see 'Drive', it is a ticket to movie supremacy. ***** Excellent",10,5,17,17 September 2011
The Theory of Everything," It was theoritcally possible for this to be a good film
","I have discovered a pun hole where all punvolution originated. OK, so I am no Dr. Stephen Hawking, but I can write a cheesy pun review on a movie about him. 'The Theory of Everything' is an emotional movie about the life of Dr. Stephen Hawking, the renowned physicist who presented theoretical predictions including the one that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Hawking was the first to set forth a cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. Hawking also achieved success with works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general; his 'Brief History of Time' stayed on the British Sunday Times best-sellers list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. While my 'Not so Brief History of Puns' was not even published! Anyways, what made this so courageous and commendable, is that Hawking was able to accomplish all these great feats living with the debilitating ALS disease. All of this is depicted in 'The Theory of Everything', but Director James Marsh decided to march to the beat of a different drum by highlighting Hawking's longtime relationship with his first wife Jane Hawking. So, 'The Theory of Everything' is mostly a love story about overcoming insurmountable odds and having profound resiliency to produce a marriage and a family. Stephen had three kids with Jane. There was hardly any Marsh Madness in the direction of the picture, so I give a passing grade to the film's orchestration. I thought that Anthony McCarten's screenplay was a tad weak; and it might have been the film's only minor drawback. However, the greatest force of 'The Theory of Everything' was the powerful performances from Eddie Redmayne as Stephen and Felicity Jones as Jane; my theory is that they will be both get nominated for Oscars, and yes I did not kill any brain cells figuring that one out. So drop everything, I mean everything, and discover 'The Theory of Everything'. **** Good",8,0,1,31 December 2014
Room," What a lovely room!
","Please, please, please. Can you make room for about two minutes to read my review of the movie 'Room'? This movie is a haunting look at the emotional & survival aspects of child abduction seen through the eyes of a young boy. That boy's name is Jack; his mother Joy was abducted as a teen and held captive for numerous years. The despicable excuse for a human being who abducted Joy impregnated her and the result was Jack. The first half of the movie is captured in the shed 'room' where Joy & Jack are held captive and it shows them both go through their normal daily routine, and their mother to child interactions. It is very disturbing to watch, but so resounding in how their resiliency holds them through. Jack is blinded to much of the world due to his captivity, and only envisions to be reality on what he sees on television; this is brilliantly presented by screenwriter Emma Donoghue who adapted the script from her novel. The second half of 'Room' is stored in the aspects of adjusting to the real world after Joy & Jack are able to free their captor. Director Lenny Abrahamson helms the picture with a commanding orchestration of the inner emotional layers that Joy & Jack go through their experience in captivity and adjusting; my only minor critique of 'Room' was in the film's unrealistic ending which obviously I won't reveal because there is no room for spoilers in my reviews. Brie Larson was astounding as Joy, and this is the real Joy who will be the next Oscar winner for Best Actress. Jacob Tremblay as Jack was a revelation, and this young actor is heading straight to the real world of stardom; he is a genuine pure talent. There was also strong supporting work from Joan Allen as Joy's mother, William H. Macy as Joy's father, and Tom McCamus as the boyfriend of Joy's mom. OK, I will free you now from this review, sorry I held you captive with all those roomy puns. Just make sure you make room for 'Room'. ***** Excellent",9,1,8,4 February 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Lordy! Lordy! Lordy! This one is also awful!
","We have witnessed another melancholic Two Towers tragedy. That is the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. This ring also fits into the hand of pathetic cinema just as the one of the previous fellowship. The film brings back all of its characters: hobbits Frodo & Sam, Gandalf the Wizard, hobbit defender Aragorn, and all the rest of these ludicrous characters who are more reminiscent of `ringling circus' animals than lords of rings.   My quest, just as it was last year, is for this ring version to get destroyed at Oscar night and not receive any major wins. * Failure",2,0,1,2 March 2003
Across the Universe," Too much Beatlemania here but not bad!
","Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Beatlejuice! Like a flying Lennonball, another Beatle homage musical has crossed the cinematic universe that has a familiar ringo to it. It is Director Julie Taymor's love-story jingle narrative 'Across The Universe'. A plethora of Beatle tunes are incorporated within the plot of a young Liverpool lad named Jude who crosses the pond to America and meets a gorgeous born-into-wealth 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds'. Jude travels to America primarily to meet his estranged father who is an Ivy League university janitor so they can 'Come Together'. There, Jude meets a 'Day Tripper' college student named Max and with 'A Little Help From His Friend', Jude meets Max's sister none other than Lucy herself. Mad Max is exhausted by his family demands on striving to succeed so he rebels and consequently Jude & Max move to America Beatleland, New York. In that 'Apple City Field Forever', they meet a group of bohemians including a sexy cougar singer/landlord Sadie, a Jimi Hendriexian guitar player Jo-Jo, and an Asian lesbian Prudence. Not before long, Lucy joins them in New York after her boyfriend is killed in combat. 'Hey Jude' now Lucy is available and before you can say 'I Love Lucy', they fall for each other and all 'They Need Is Love' now to exist joyously in this universe. 'Across The Universe' then dwells into 60's themes such as war, democracy, violence, sex, drugs, an of course rock n roll. Cutesy for a 60's themed film but all too familiar; but I 'Let It Be' since it is a film of the 'hippie hippie hooray' era. I do commend the actors for their theatrical efforts in taking on such challenging characters, but none of the performances caused me to 'Shout' with exhilaration for their thespian contributions. Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais are the 'Paperback Writers' of the screenplay of 'Across The Universe', but their film paper should have screamed 'Help' because it lacked originality and authenticity. Director Taymor tames it well with the visuals in the musical sequences but has a 'Ticket to Override' by inserting an overabundance of Beatle tunes which take away the realism of the film's romantic plot line. 'Across The Universe' is not out of this universe, but not bad to check out after a 'Hard Day's Night'. *** Average",7,1,2,25 October 2008

","'The Incredibles' is not based on how the Bush-Cheney ticket won reelection. That film is called 'Fun with Dick & George'. 'The Incredibles' is the latest computer animated pix (as in 'Pixar') flick. I do not want to sound like I have 'Buddy Pine Syndrome' and be ruthless, but I must admit that to me 'The Incredibles' was not all that incredible as many critics & filmgoers thought it to be. I actually enjoyed more the old TV show 'That's Incredible' than 'The Incredibles'. OK, so maybe that was an incredulous incredible statement. I did not mean to go that far. Don't get me wrong! I did think that Brad Bird's film did soar at times with its elucidating look at a superhero family trying to live a suburban lifestyle before they are forced to be 'superheroexpialadoso' (oops! wrong movie) again.

Gran Torino," The Pitches of Eastwood are still striking magic!
","It is deluxe, it is old, it is powerful, it swaggers, it still runs well, it can direct you smoothly, it is priceless, and it is infamous. I could be easily referring to the classic Gran Torino automobile; however, I am primarily talking about the monumental Hollywood God: Clint Eastwood. He continues to flabbergast all of us movie buffs by still maintaining his film-making supremacy even at the twilight of his illustrious career. I do not know what drives Clint; but I do know that he has driven his latest film 'Gran Torino' to a superb flick destination. Eastwood directed 'Gran Torino' and stars as Walt Kowalski, a retired Detroit autoworker who grimaces and prejudices his way through life. He is a recent widow who has two estranged sons; and he is not shy to share racist comments with others about the Hmongs whom he feels have wrongfully inhabited the neighborhood he has resided in for decades. Walt has trouble getting along with others including his two sons and his grandkids. Let's just say that Walt Kowalski is at the opposite end of the spectrum of Walt Disney. Walt's precious possession is a 1972 Gran Torino that he keeps stored in his garage in mint condition. When Walt's young Hmong neighbor Thao is forced to steal the Gran Torino by a group of hoodlums is when 'Gran Torino' stars gearing up its thought-provoking plot. Thao's family is almost attacked by the same hoodlums but Walt comes to the rescue and to quote Dirty Harry himself 'makes their day'. Walt all of a sudden becomes 'the good, the not-so-bad, and the pretty' geriatric boy of the neighborhood and is suddenly worshiped as a hero in the Hmong neighborhood. The Hmongs bring Walt gifts in appreciation, but Walt wants to be left alone in his 'grumpy old man' life. However, some type of 'changeling' gradually embodies Walt and he stars befriending his Hmong neighbors; most notably the witty female teenager Sue and her younger brother no other than Thao himself. Thao is forced to work for Walt by his family in order to repay his debt to 'Walt Society' for trying to steal le Torino. Walt and Thao's elevator relationship is the heartstring and spark plug of 'Gran Torino' and provides the sincere life lessons of the film; but not in an afterschool special kind of way. Writer Nick Schenk's touching screenplay is one of the best of the year; you have to 'schenk' it out. I am glad than Schenk took a 'grassroots' approach to writing by including the film's catchphrase 'Get of my lawn'. Let's head back east now! Because 'Gran Torino' is Eastwood's showcase! He has never acted better in his classic career! He was mesmerizing as Walt and his 'Gran Torino' thespian performance is headed for a red carpet light at The Oscars. Within Clint's direction of the film, he properly drives 'Gran Torino' into reverberating societal & humanistic issues as: racism, mortality, religion, kinship, culture, friendship, and even more. In other words, his 'Gran Torino' is fully loaded! Therefore, test drive the 'Gran Torino' today! It will be worth your cinematic ride! ***** Excellent",10,2,8,21 January 2009
The Hurt Locker," This movie is the bomb!
","I promise you this will not hurt (maybe a little) meaning my following punsightful review of the explosive Iraq war film 'The Hurt Locker'. There has been buzz circulating stating that other presumed Best Picture Oscar contenders do not stand a chance in diffusing 'The Hurt Locker' from reaching the golden statuette. I would not personally go that far, but undoubtedly the film is a worthy contender in the Camp Oscar battle. Director Kathryn Bigelow has orchestrated in 'The Hurt Locker' the best Iraq War film assembled so far. Bigelow's authentic picturesque display of an Army Bomb Squad's courageous tasks in diffusing bombs is a totally suspenseful tour-de-force. Jeremy Renner stars as Sgt. William James, the main bomber of the squad, whose passion for the risqu√© of diffusing bombs and war battle confrontations demonstrates not all soldiers have a mentality that 'war is hell'; some live for it as King James here. Anthony Mackie co-stars as J.T. Sanborn, the more by-the-book or bomb for that matter sergeant in the squad who constantly conflicts with James' fiery bombastic nature. Brian Geraghty plays Specialist Owen Eldridge, the internally conflicted of the bunch who has his own psychological time bomb ticking in his continuous fixated anxious mind. All three of these actors give solid performances, but its Renner who goes further outside the acting box in delivering the apex acting of the film. Bigelow's expert craftsmanship or should I say craftswomanship is displayed with the detail-oriented vision of the fervor, passion, anxiety, and embodiment of the risk-taking physical atrocities and adrenaline mental rushes of war which have helmed Kathryn with a five-star General Director status for her efforts here. This Bigelow is no Dunce Bigelow and her name will be included in the Best Director Oscar list for this year! 'The Hurt Locker' also should garner 'sure lock' Oscar nominations for its stellar Cinematography and Art Direction. Mark Boal's captivating screenplay bowled me over, even though a few times I got somewhat lost in the garrulous crossfire of war terminology. I would not insert 'The Hurt Locker' in the pedestals of 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'Full Metal Jacket' of war films, but its not too far off. Hopefully, I have provided enough of affirmative cinematic combinations for you to unlock 'The Hurt Locker' before it explodes away from your local theatre. **** Excellent",9,4,10,5 September 2009
Moulin Rouge!," This One Does Not SIng The Blues!
","Go sister go! Go brother go! And see the greatest show on film this year- `Moulin Rouge.' This has to be one of the most beautifully photographed films of all time. I am sure that this musical gem of a film will dance away with Best Art Direction & Cinematography Academy Awards. Nicole Kidman stars as the prostitiute-showgirl of Moulin Rouge. Ewan Mcgregor co-stars as the gullible writer in search of love & freedom at the Moulin Rouge. The film is about their love, song, and dance at the Moulin Rouge. The high notes of the film (and there are many) are the illuminating, colorful, and energetic musical sequences. The low notes, if any, are the way too many appearances of the ruthless duke who derails from the beauty of the film. Kidman should `cruise' (sorry nic) her way to a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Mcgregor was far out with his performance. Co-stars John Leguizamo & Jim Broadbent eccentric acting should be recognized at oscar time. Kudos should also go to Director Baz Luhrmann's creative direction. So set sail to the cinematic experience of the year at the `Moulin Rouge.' ***** Excellent",9,0,2,22 June 2001
Ex Machina," Ex Sellent!
","The movie 'Ex Machina' is not based on most of my ex-girlfriends! Kidding! Kidding! Kidding!, if you are out there in social media land. Anyways, I will try my best to let my movie review of the indie sci-fi flick 'Ex Machina' not sound robotic, but that probably won't happen. Not because of my so-called pun cheesy writing skills, but it's primarily because 'Ex Machina' is the most fascinating & well-rounded movie I have seen so far in 2015. First time Writer-Director Alex Garland's luminous looking film stars Domhnall Gleason as a young computer techy Caleb, who works for a Google-like online search company. Caleb wins an office lottery to visit the exquisite field home of the company's owner Nathan, played by the 'will get an Oscar one day' impressive actor Oscar Isaac. Nathan introduces Caleb to an artificial female robot named Ava; Nathan instructs Caleb to be a product of a field of exercises to test Ava's artificial intelligence; but Ava unfortunately transform herself to the 'whatever happened to' Haley Joel Osment. Just kidding! I just see pun people too much. OK, enough. Ava takes a liking to Caleb; and before you could say 'Ava Maria', havoc starts to occur. Garland perfects the look of the film, and does a remarkable job in scripting an unpredictable narrative. The up-and-coming Alicia Vikander was quite solid as Ava, and Oscar Isaac deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work as the arrogant & manipulative Nathan. However, I can't say the same for the robotic starring performance of Glesson as Caleb. But I will say no more, and let you experience the surreal world of 'Ex Machina'. ***** Excellent",10,3,6,21 August 2015
Grudge Match," Spilt Decision, but give it a marginal win
","'Grudge Match' stars Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNiro as two former rival boxers who decide to duke it up in their geriatric time in a grudge match. Speaking of which, I have held a grudge against many Stallone movies not including 'Rocky', 'Rocky 2', 'Cop Land' and 'Cliffhanger'. As far as DeNiro goes, I am not going to put up a fight here because a good 80% of his movies have been worthy, but even Bobby D. has been knocked down by a flew clunkers himself. I would not call 'Grudge Match' a surefire winner but it still fell marginally into my ring of worthy comedies for 2013. Stallone stars as Henry 'Razor' Sharp, the mild-mannered but off-putting of the two who unexpectedly retired before the initial scheduled grudge match 30 years ago. DeNiro co-stars as Billy 'The Kid' McDonnen, the womanizing alcoholic who discovers he has as adult son from a previous affair; who by the way, the woman happened to be in love with Razor thirty years ago. Director Peter Segal added some fun to the piece by satirizing the Stallone & DeNiro infamous 70's boxer characters; Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta, respectively; but then again, he did not knock me out with his orchestration of the picture also. Stallone and DeNiro were adequate with their performances, but it looked more like an easy-peazy fun time for them. Kevin Hart was not exactly a formidable acting supporting sparring partner for Stallone & DeNiro with his over-the-top performance as an eager promoter. In the other ring, Alan Arkin looked lackadaisical with his performance as Razor's longtime trainer. Kim Basinger shows up here also as the woman that had a split decision as Sally, yes that girl, who romanced Razor but fooled around and fathered The Kid's kid three decades ago. Please don't have a grudge against me if 'Grudge Match' is not your cup of tea; as I said, it's not a champion of a movie, but it had its moments; as most boxers do. *** Average",7,0,1,15 April 2015
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Curious Pun Film Review of Benjamin Button!
","As I turned 40 this past summer, I was craving that some unexplained cosmic phenomenon would cause me to be positively inflicted with a severe curious case of Benjamin-Buttonitis. Is there a remote chance that I might be celebrating my 39th Birthday next summer? Probably not! The premise of laboring a film about a man who ages backwards is undoubtedly a very intriguing one. Director David Fincher has fulfilled our curiosity with that by helming 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'. Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin Button, an extraordinary man who is born old and gets younger with time. Benji is raised by two kids who love their pet! Oops! Wrong Benji movie! Benjamin is raised by Queenie, a black woman who is a caregiver at a senior citizens home in New Orleans. However, things get kind of old for Benjamin with time. Therefore, he embarks on a voyage in the high seas as he gets younger and restless. Benjamin then meets Elizabeth Abbott, a bored married woman who finds his lifeline case very intriguing and falls for the younger (or older) Benjamin! I am confused!!!! I she 'cougaring' him or not? That relationship turns out to be a short term one! Abbott eventually became the first woman to swim the English Channel. Benjamin's true buttoned-down love is for Daisy. Ben meets Daisy as a child while he is an old man; and as time progresses, he gets younger, she gets older, and they meet in the middle. 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' does have some similar themes as 'Forrest Gump' but Button's case is more extraordinaire than Gump's; but Gump goes through more outlandish life experiences than Button. Although, hands down, I take the Button deal more than the Gump one anytime. In any sense, the film is primarily Benjamin and Daisy's undying love story. Pitt's timeless performance was very commendable and will grow fonder with age! Cate Blanchett was once again impressive as Daisy, and she continues to gel nicely with Pitt in the screen chemistry department; they played a bickering married couple in 2006's 'Babel'. Taraji P. Henson charmed us with her maternal Queenie portrayal, and Tilda Swinton was all about the abbott with her swimmingly winning work as Elizabeth Abbott. Pitt's makeup jobs as the young-in-age geriatric Button (smell a massive oxymoron there) was nothing short of phenomenal! I also commend the Art Directors and Cinematographers for their challenging case of Benjamin Button's picturesque appearance. There has been a curious case sometime now in Hollywood on why the acclaimed David Fincher has never been nominated for a Best Director Academy Award. I think that case will be solved once he receives his well-deserved Oscar nomination for his visually-enlightening cinematic architecture of 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'. My only age issue with the film was the time itself! It was 30 minutes too long for me, I felt like a year older (or younger, depending if I had Buttonitis or not) at the end of the film. Another minor gripe I had with the Button flick was with Eric Roth's humdrum screenplay; it looked like a copyright infringement of his own 'Forrest Grump' screenplay. Roth should sue himself! Nonetheless, I am still highly recommending for the old and the young to check out 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button'. **** Good",8,0,1,16 January 2009
Hidden Figures," Mission Accomplished, I guess
","I am ready to set off some not-so hidden puns in my review of the space drama 'Hidden Figures'. The movie has received major figures at the box office, and is nominated for several Oscar nominations including Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Motion Picture. 'Hidden Figures' is based on the true story of three African- American women who provided some major mathematical data needed for NASA to help launch off America's first successful space missions in the early 60's. However, the main figure of this flick is the math wiz Katherine Johnson, admirably played by Taraji P. Henson. Octavia Spencer does provide some help here as Dorothy Vaughn, who was very instrumental in NASA's IBM management. Uprising star Janelle Monae plays Mary Jackson, the lively NASA engineer-to-be who fights the court in order to be enrolled in a all-white school. These were the 60's so Director Theodore Melfi does incorporate the themes of civil rights, segregation, and gender differences within his filmmaking mission of 'Hidden Figures'. Kevin Costner dazzles as the NASA Supervisor Al Harrison. Did not get much of a thespian big bang from Jim Parson's performance as the bullyish NASA engineer Paul Stafford. And 'Moonlight' star Mahershala Ali moonlights here also as Johnson's beau Colonel Jim Johnson; but was not in 'Moonlight' fantastic mode. Spencer did receive a Best Supporting Actress performance for a character that was not much of a blast in this space movie; so yea, I thought it was a fine performance but don't think it warranted a nomination. Don't get me wrong, 'Hidden Figures' does have feel-good qualities and plays a well-deserved homage to these ladies who were such an addition to NASA's progress. 'Hidden Figures' does rock it at times, but its not a perfect cinematic mission. **** Good",7,3,9,31 January 2017
Lincoln," Important piece of filmmaking and DDL is once again swell!!
","I could write shorter corny pun-infested movie reviews, but when I get started I'm too lazy to stop; which in no way shape or form is related to a line in the 'Lincoln' movie that was 'I could write shorter sermons but when I get started I'm too lazy to stop' Relax, I am kidding! Please keep reading and do not impeach this movie review. 'Lincoln' is a monumental piece of premier filmmaking and powerful acting that should garner mucho Award love come the season to hand out those premios. Director Steven Spielberg (yea, him) has helmed another classic historical movie that should be highly utilized by secondary school teachers to show to their students in their classrooms. Spielberg focuses the narrative during the time that Lincoln was passionately pursuing the passing of the 13th Amendment which would abolish slavery. Of course, Abe had to go through some intense legislative hurdles including getting votes from Democratic legislators that were more 'yay' than 'nay' for slavery. Spielberg also presents once more in a film the ravages of war with graphic depictions and human turmoil of the Civil War in 'Lincoln'; as he did in 'Saving Private Ryan' with World War II and 'Schindler's List' with the Holocaust. Steven is the anti-war maestro and may all Gods bless him for that. Screenwriter Tony Kushner should consider a part-time gig teaching U.S. History; because, even though it's filled with legislative jargon as it should be, his scribe was masterful in depicting Abraham Lincoln's pursuit of the 13th Amendment passing. But it's that presidential actor that is most probably the greatest thespian of this generation that was the summit of the movie 'Lincoln'; and that would be the stunning performance of the great Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. I am totally being 'honest' when I say Daniel nailed every part of Honest Abe; the voice, the mannerisms, the walk, the passion, the charisma and on and on and on. The Academy will most certainly have a majority vote favoring Mr. Day- Lewis to collect his third Best Actor Oscar. As paramount as it was, I am still in the group that thinks that Joaquin Phoenix's work in 'The Master' is still the tops in the Best Actor category for 2012; but not by much compared to Day-Lewis' work. 'Lincoln' also had a fine supporting acting cabinet with illustrious supporting performances from Sally Field as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln, James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, David Strathairn as Secretary of State William Seward, and Jared Harris as Ulysses S. Grant. But the top one that should definitely never be abolished from Best Supporting Acting consideration was the whopper performance from Tommy Lee Jones as abolitionist Thaddeus Stephens. As in many Spielberg films, 'Lincoln' included premier editing, score, makeup, art direction, and cinematography. 'Lincoln' is not my favorite movie of 2012, even though I envision it in my Top 10 list of 2012; however, it is the most important film of 2012. And as Abraham Lincoln states in one of the last scenes of the movie 'I would rather stay, but I must go now'. So that means I am out of here, but please remember to vote 'yay' for 'Lincoln'. ***** Excellent",9,3,11,2 December 2012
Sing Street," I save a prayer that this movie gets Oscar noms! One of the best of the year!
","I know I need to relax, but I am in such cinematic elation with a movie that shows that there is always something there to remind me of the magical 80's New Wave Music. And in comes in the form of Writer-Director John Carney's exuberant 'Sing Street'. This movie is a love letter to the 80's New Wave Romanticism movement that I just can't get enough of. It stars Ferdia Walsh-Peelo as Connor, a bullied Irish teen who decides to form a band to impress an older girl he meets in the sidewalks of Dublin. He then befriends several quirky but likable teens who become his bandmates and form the band 'Sing Street'. Lucy Boynton plays Raphina, the older girl that Connor wants to give everything she wants; and that's no careless whisper. Carney nails both the direction and the screenplay of 'Sing Street' with such feel- good and enlightening qualities that its take on me made me go back to that wonderful mid 80's musical time. Walsh-Peelo, Boynton, and the rest of the mostly young cast sure made me want to shout, shout, and let it all out that these young boys & girls on film are for real. 'Sing Street' is pure movie gold, it is for Rio, and this much is true. I have no more words. ***** Excellent",10,1,2,1 October 2016
Million Dollar Baby," Don't Get Boxed In! Check This Baby Out!
","Millions of critics have been enraptured by the sheer emotional impact of Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby'. With 'Mystic River' and now 'Baby', critics that were once 'unforgiven' to Clint because of such clunkers as 'Blood Work' & 'Bronco Billy' are now in awe to the Clintster. Not that Clint cares about that sort of thing so much because in his eyes those pundits should really be called 'The Witches of Eastwood'. 'Million Dollar Baby' stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, an impecunious waitress who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. Maggie is on a relentless pursuit to have a surly old trainer named Frankie train her. Maggie works out in Frankie's boxing gym everyday in hoping to persuade Frankie to be her hit-man. Frankie is played by none other than Eastwood himself. To be 'frank' with you, I admired Eastwood's straightforward acting work here, but do not think it deserved a Best Actor Oscar nomination. However, his direction of 'Million Dollar Baby' was worth its price. His attention to detail and framework was of the technical knockout variety. Moreover, the movie's startling emotional turn midway in the narrative is one of the most profound plot-twisters that I have seen in film in a very long time. Morgan Freeman plays the assistant gym sidekick to Frankie who he himself plays an imperative role as the overseer & narrator of the story's dramatic chops. Freeman is an acting legendary God in the business; he did play 'God' in 'Bruce Almighty'. However, his work here was poignant but not of the Best Supporting Actor nomination weight-class. The heavyweight of 'Million Dollar Baby' is Hilary Swank. She delivers passionately blow-by-blow. Her lauded performance has been recognized by numerous critics and my scorecard also shares that exact sentiment. She is the frontrunner for the Best Actress Academy Award. If Swank wins her second golden boy, Hilary will be living large in the 'Hollywood Hills'. Paul Haggis' screenplay does possess a heartfelt punch to it, but it felt lightweight at times in the church scenes. 'Million Dollar Baby' is somber and it's unlike your typical boxing movie, but those are no reasons why you should throw in the towel for 'Million Dollar Baby'. Spend a few dollars and check out the 'Million Dollar Baby'! **** Good",8,3,5,29 January 2005
Garden State," State of Greatness!
","Put on your guard because 'Garden State' is in the premier echelon of endearing films for the year 2004. Writer-Director Zach Braff, star of the TV hit show 'Scrubs', shows he is no scrub when it comes to character-driven film-making. Braff also stars in the film. He plays Andrew Largeman, a middling L.A. actor who heads back to his Jersey hometown to attend his mother's funeral. In his 4 day Jersey visit, Largeman experiences a 'larger than life' life-awakening eureka effect which will alter his life forever. He confronts issues which he had avoided in numerous years and gets into an authentic Jersey 'Garden State' of mind. Natalie Portman co-stars as Samantha, the garrulous Jersey chic who plants the love seeds of 'Largeman's Garden'. Peter Sarsgaard plays Mark, the jocuse gravedigger who indirectly plays a grave part in Largerman's psychological discoveries. Can you 'dig' that? To round out the top acting guards of 'Garden State', we also have Ian Holm who plays Largeman's despondent father. All execute phenomenal performances! However, it was the 'Jersey Girl' that really did it for me; and I am not referring to Ben Affleck's box office blunder flick. I am talking about Ms. Portman. Her performance as Samantha is Oscar-worthy. Lately, Portman has been in the 'acting zone' with stellar works in 'Cold Mountain', 'Closer', and now 'Garden State'. Hopefully, she will be fighting another type of 'Star Wars' with fellow thespians in competing for some acting awards. Nevertheless, 'Garden State' is Zach Braff's garden of eden brainchild. His heartfelt screenplay & intuitive direction was quite impressive for a rookie filmmaker who some thought was just good enough to 'scrub' floors! Sorry, Zach! Just joking! Do not have a 'Zach Attack'! The music of the film was quite compelling and was a key attribute in its storytelling component. For those numerous reasons just mentioned, it will be a worthwhile ride if you visit the 'Garden State'. It is one of the best films of the year! ***** Excellent",10,1,3,13 January 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Rapace has injected herself as a major star!
","I remember the days when I used to date a few girls with dragon tattoos. It marked me as a guy that liked Gothic chicks, or something like that. I thought that was unfair stereotypical criticism not only to me but for the young ladies. OK, this never happened (well, maybe a couple of times it did). I was just trying to be a guy with a 'girl with a dragon tattoo' story, but obviously that intro did not make its mark. Anyways, most have heard of this foreign flick adapted from the late Stieg Larsson's best-selling novel about Mikael Blomkvist, a Stockholm disgraced reporter who is employed by Henrik Vanger, a geriatric Swedish millionaire in order to unravel the mystery of who killed Vanger's beloved niece Harriet. Vanger offers Blomkvist a wealthy fee for his services, the only catch is that the murder occurred 40 years ago and it is not fresh blood anymore (ouch, I hit below the belt on that one, must have been the dragon inside of me), and another catch is that Henrik requests for Mikael to investigate some of the family members of his own Vanger clan. I guess Henrik is of the 'school of thinking' that a family who is rich together also kills together. However, where this movie gets profoundly skin deep is in the character of Lisbeth Salander, a gothicetta computer hacker who has been able to hack away on Blomkvist's CPU for sometime and eventually ends up teaming with Mikael to investigate the Vanger cold case. Salander is witty, crafty, sexy, sly, sharp, and also has one big ass tattoo on her back. I thought that Director Niels Arden Opley's film adaptation of Larsson's masterpiece literary offering was more than OK but not perfect, but then again Opley could just do so much in incorporating all the intrinsic details from the book to the movie. Screenwriters Nikolaj Arcel and Rasmus Heisterberg probably knew that they were playing with fire in adapting a Larsson book to a movie screenplay, but they actually excelled with a well-knitted movie scribe. I must report that there was no libel in Michael Nyqvist's suave performance as Blomkvist, but it was Noomi Rapace's multi-layered thespian effort in her Lisbeth portrayal what fired me up the most about 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'. Noomi is looming as a major actress! I have yet to see the film's sequels 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' (not based on all the girls who have dated me) or 'The Girls Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest' (not based on all the girls who have kicked me where it hurts the most), but I doubt those films can reach the achievement of its praise-worthy predecessor. **** Good",8,1,2,15 May 2011
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Goody Film!
","Edward R. Murrow was a legendary CBS television anchorman during the golden age of 1950's television. That was the time when 'TV Video killed the Radio Star'. Murrow was pointed, prepared, cerebral, and audacious. No more audacious when he challenged Senator Joseph McCarthy controversial claims on numerous Americans alleged ties with communist parties. For several years, McCarthy's bully tactics were uncontested by the media. However, Mr. Ed got on his high horse and the gallup ratings poll skyrocketed for CBS when he whitewashed the Big Mac Senator in several televised news programs. Why should I continue to inform you on this historical broadcasting event when you can see for yourself in George Clooney's film 'Good Luck, and Good Night'? The film's title was Murrow's signature line. Director Clooney must be commended for not being 'tubeloose' by crafting the M & M debate with exact precision. He also intensifies the film by inserting actual McCarthy footage and presenting it in monochrome. Georgie Boy also validates 'Good Night, and Good Luck' by screening the fast paced style of the television medium. Thespian Clooney also executes a labor-type vociferous performance as longtime CBS News Producer Fred Friendly. Clooney's 'friendly' relationship with the Academy should 'reel' George two Oscar nominations for Best Director and Best Supporting Actor. Frank Langella also executes a subtle but frankly striking performance as CBS President William Paley. However, what was not newsworthy about 'Good Night, and Good Luck' was the superfluous subplot of two CBS married reporters portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson. What anchors this reputable film was the superb performance of David Strathairn as Murrow. I wish him good luck at Oscar night because undoubtedly he will garner a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Strathairn nails down Murrow's mannerisms and verbose to an exact television science. Broadcasting rights (and not wrongs) should also go to the creative art direction, thematic costume design, and garrulous screenplay of 'Good Night, and Good Luck'. So for goodness sake, do yourself a favor and have a good night by tuning in to 'Good Night, and Good Luck'.**** Good (what else)",8,2,4,18 November 2005
Mulholland Drive," Best Film Of The Year So Far!!!!!!!!!
","Start your engine and gear up for the cinematic experience of the year at `Mulholland Drive'. Director David Lynch's dreamscape new film is one of the best of the year! It will definitely make u-turn your head in bedazzlement after you watch it. The movie is about an aspiring young actress who befriends a lost amnesia vixen on-the-run. At the same time, the film also focuses on a director who is forced to cast the leading lady in his film by some quirky underground mobsters. However, the plot is not what drives this film. The surreal images of the film is what makes it unforgettable! It is like a dream! Never told in a normal sequential order. It is the images what we most remember in a dream! Just like it is the images that you will most remember in `Mulholland Drive'. Director David Lynch should have his hand lynched on to a Best Director Oscar statuette next March. It is without a doubt, the best direction executed in a film this year! The films unknown female stars Naomi Watts & Laura Elena Harring were a vision! Watts out because Naomi will be a name you will hear a lot of during the next several years; and Harring's Rita Hayworth looks is worth the price of admission. Their lesbian thespian scenes will be in your top 3 list of the most sexiest scenes of all time. But most important, their performances are of oscar-caliber. Also, this just-in √Ç‚Äì Justin Theroux also delivered an oscar-worthy performance as the constrained male director. Even one-hit wonder Billy Ray Cyrus was solid as the pool cleaning stud who sleeps with the director's wife who breaks our male protagonist's `acky, bracky heart'. This film will leave you mesmerized for days or even weeks. If you do not believe me, just get in your car now and head on over to `Mulholland Drive'. ***** Excellent",10,10,22,6 November 2001
Guardians of the Galaxy," Right Guardians!
","Call me lost in space for taking an eternity to experience the 'Guardians of the Galaxy', but I finally launched into it and it was worth the ride. The blockbuster stars Chris Pratt as a charismatic intergalactic criminal named Peter Quill who also goes by StarLord. Peter himself was abducted as a child by a clan of intergalactic criminals just after his mom passed away. His national treasure has always been a walkman with a cassette of some classic tunes, which was one of the classic aspects of the movie. Through unexpected circumstances, Quill teams up with other intergalactic bad guys that are really good; including the green gal Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the vengeful prisoner Drax (Dave Bautista), the sarcastic loudmouthed raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and the one-phrase tree Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Sure, they are a diverse bunch but their mission to stop madman Ronan's Run to control the universe was quite imperative. Director James Gunn sure had some fun developing this one, and he did a commendable job, even though there were one too many action sequences. Where Gunn hit right on target was on the witty screenplay he scribed with Nicole Perlman. What I thought was really a blast off about 'Guardians of the Galaxy' was the zany, pitch-perfect vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket. His Rocket launched vocal greatness, even though Rocket was off his rocker. OK, my pun mission is done here. Have a blast with this one, if you haven't already. **** Good",8,2,6,20 July 2016
The Imitation Game," I love this game!!
","'The Imitation Game' is not a bio movie based on the life of infamous comedic impersonator Rich Little; even though that would have been a nifty little film. 'The Intimation Game' however is a bio flick based on British Mathematician Alan Turing, who with his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, tried to crack the Enigma Code to obtain German transmission during World War II; not an easy math problem, that's for sure! Unfortunately and unjustifiably, Turing was persecuted for his homosexuality which was illegal in Britain during that time. Director Morten Tyldum's breakthrough direction is one of the finest of the year. Tyldum is no dumb-dumb by putting us right in the middle of the codebreaking challenges & actions, while also masterfully presenting the complex humanistic persona of his protagonist, Alan Turing. Graham Moore also delivers solid write play on his fine screenplay delivery to 'The Imitation Game'. It is not an enigma that Benedict Cumberbatch's astounding performance as Turing broke the Academy code for a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar nomination. Keira Knightley does not completely imitate the grand performance of Cumberbatch, but the lovely Keira does shine with her supporting performance as Joan Clarke, the fellow mathematician who ends up engaged to Turing for non-conventational marital purposes. The much underrated Matthew Goode does good work once more as Hugh Alexander, who is part of Turing's dream team of codebreakers. So get on your game, and play 'The Imitation Game'; no code required, just an admission movie theatre ticket is what's needed. I loved this game!!!***** Excellent",10,4,13,31 January 2015

Paranormal Activity," A paraprofessional scare job!
","Another rare cheap project that made crazy money inhabited our cinematic space this past year in Writer-Director Oren Peli's 'Paranormal Activity'. Many compare it to the low-budget, high-grossing late 90's horror flick 'The Blair Witch Project'. I thought that 'Paranormal Activity' had its suspenseful & scary moments but overall my consensus is that 'The Blair Witch Project' had a better premise & narrative, and even marketing plan; even though both movies were ingenious in the marketing end. Just in case you are in the abnormal activity end of the movie world and do not know what the premise of 'Paranormal Activity' is, I will divulge you that info. The movie is about Micah and Katie, a young San Diego couple who suspect there is paranormal activity going on in the master bedroom of their two-story house during the midnight hours. Therefore, they set up a camera in their bedroom and let the video roll as they are sleeping in order to later see for themselves if they are in the spirit. As Blair Witch, the haunting scenes of the film divulge themselves from minor sounds that make a major chilling impact. Peli scored some points on the directorial end of the suspenseful scenes of the movie, but focused way too much on the couple's ridiculous arguments on the writing end. But what do I do know! It only cost him $15,000 to produce the film and its made over $100 million in the box office. So Pelisimo, you are laughing all the way to the bank! I guess lots of not-so-normal, high-volume ATM activity use for Oren now. Micah Slot & Katie Featherston star as Micah & Katie. So this is all real and in reality they were not really acting! Even in the sex scenes of the film! Kidding! There was not much of any Parahormone Activity in the movie. And there was not much of any thespian activity in the movie either, but Micah & Katie's job was not really to act, just to ghostbuster their way through. 'Paranormal Activity' is sure one step beyond some of the horror movie duds that have been released in the last few years, but zoom in more on the creative direction of the movie than on its mediocre script & acting. So hope you enjoyed my usual Punnormal Activity that I inject in most of my film reviews, or maybe this will continue to haunt me. **** Good",8,0,0,18 March 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Liked better the original Wonka scoop of chocolate!
","Oompa Loompa Loompa Di Du¬Ö¬Ö.. OK, I will fall short from singing the infamous catchy tune from the celebrated children's classic film 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. Unfortunately, the song was not included in the Willy Wonka remake 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'. That is not the only reason why 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' was not able to surpass its predecessor. For those of you who are not familiar of the chocolate dark side of this sweet fable, here it is: Charlie Bucket is a sweet destitute boy who gets a golden ticket in his Willy Wonka chocolate bar which enables to him to get invited to the mesmeric Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory. He takes his granddaddy along and encounters other golden ticket raffle-winning children who are definitely not a bunch of sweet vanillas. Wonka himself is an eccentric who probably had too many nuts in his ice cream as a child. Johnny Depp stars as Wonka; it is wilder than the original Gene Wilder 'Wonka' performance. However, wilder does not necessarily signify better. Even though Depp was 'depplicious' at times with his nifty verbose, it still did not satisfy my taste buds because of the unnecessary slapstick that was instilled in his character. Director Tim Burton does create a compelling Wonka World but he did have his 'rocky road' in direction by sinking too much into Wonka's mundane childhood. Child actor Freddie Highmore was able to find neverland in his affecting performance in 'Finding Neverland', but he did not exactly melt me with his inflated 'Charlie Angel' effort. The rest of the cast: David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor & Helena Bonham Carter as Mr. & Mrs. Bucket, and Christopher Lee as Dr. Wonka was not the supporting acting dessert I was craving for. 'Charlie and The Chocolate Factory' is not exactly a 'bucket' of ¬Ö¬Ö. , but I would also not spend too much golden money to get a golden ticket to see it. *** Average",7,0,1,1 April 2006

World Trade Center," Oliver is a good boy after all!
","Director Oliver Stone is not one to shy away from controversy. His Stone Age film career has scrutinized methods that the U.S. Government has invoked in dealing with issues such as: the Vietnam War, JFK Assassination, Watergate, Music Censorship, and the Stock Market to name a few. In his real life, Stone also has been a headliner himself by being arrested for drug possession. I guess Oliver was trying to live up to his last name. However, he brings a disparate directorial approach to the 9/11 film 'World Trade Center'. Stone focuses the narrative on valor and survival. Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena star as Port Authority officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno. They were one the last survivors rescued from the World Trade Center catastrophe. They were stuck in the rubble of the Twin Towers for numerous hours using their perseverance, humor, and encouragement as survival tools under extreme excruciating circumstances. Cage's Sgt. McLoughiln is an emotionless leader who is silently dumbfounded by the unexpected tragedy. Pena's Officer Jimeno is the simpleton humanitarian who has a way of bringing the unadorned aspects of life to life by using as it as a motivating force. Even though McLoughlin and Jimeno are as dissimilar as they come, they both share a common force in being loving family men and devoted law enforcement reps. Their manhole conversations focused on such assorted topics as: the Starsky & Hutch theme song, Jesus with a water bottle, procrastination of a kitchen cabinet project and paternal responsibilities. Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play the suffering, despondent wives who are out-of-the-loop on their husbands' fate. Cage and Pena were heroic and powerful with their acting contributions. They were the Twin Thespian Towers of 'World Trade Center'. However, my opinion was not proportionate in symmetry fashion with the overacted efforts of Bello and Gyllenhaal. These stellar actresses were not at their prime here and their overplayed grief was the slight terror of the film. Screenwriter Andrea Berlof does stay united and committed to the actual verbal interactions which took place on that dismal day. Auteur Stone also constructs the scenes with mesmerizing realities and acute depictions which will stay in your mind & hearts for days. To some 'World Trade Center' might be 'too much, too large, and too soon'. However. I do salute Stone for pledging allegiance by providing us this honorary tale. **** Good",8,4,10,5 September 2006
The Hangover Part II," A good buzz! The unnecessary action sequences cause it not to be a great hangover!
","It happened again in 'The Hangover Part II'. I am referring to many of the ingenious comedic elements that made the first 'Hangover' a real crowd pleaser- the magnetic rapport between its three main protagonists or better stated, those pack of wolves; the unpredictability of the narrative structure in the protagonists' ordeal trying to figure out the mania that occurred during their obliterated state; the scene-stealing comments from the eccentric Alan character; and of course 'those pictures'. Sure one could argue that it is more of the same from the original, but if it ain't broke don't fix it or forget it for that matter. 'The Hangover II' takes place in Thailand a couple of years after the first Hangover mayhem occurred in Vegas. Dentist Stu (Ed Helms) is marrying his lovely young bride in Thailand; however, Stu wants to extract himself from anything close that resembles a 'bachelor party' due to the toothless mania that happened to him in Vegas. Stu's best buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Doug (Justin Bartha) head east with their wives and kids for Stu's wedding. And even the offbeat Alan attends even though Stu is reluctant with the idea. Into the picture in this one is also Stu fianc√É¬©e's teenage brother Teddy. And before you could say 'just-one-beer beach bonfire in a Thailand Resort causes Bangkok profound partying', the madcap fiesta experience returns to the Wolfpack; and Teddy is also along for the ride. Doug does save himself from the forgettable partying by splitting from the bonfire early. I do not want to provide too many more shots on what happened in 'The Hangover II' because it would then spoil your hangover experience. But let me just say that they don't call it 'bang kok' for nothing. As in the original, this Hangover flick also gets some zany chow time from the flamboyant villain Mr. Chow, again masterfully played by Ken Jeong. I also loved the cameo work from the great Paul Giamatti. And yes, we do get another scene-stealing Tyson comedic punch in this one from the Champ! In fact, all the performances were as good in the sequel as in the original, but still the top thespian of the Wolfpack pack is Zach Galifianakis, who delivers another comedic brawny performance as the one & only Alan. Director Todd Phillips keeps the pace engaging as he did the first time around, but my only Phillips knock is that in a few scenes he tried to do the whole 'action-comedy' thing in 'The Hangover Part II' which made me want to barf, its called 'The Hangover Part II' not 'Bad Boys II'; nevertheless, another solid directorial orchestration from Phillips. The screen writing team of Phillips and Craig Mazin & Scott Armstrong delivered a funny script outside the whole 'bang bang' sequences. 'The Hangover Part II' is a must-see even though you probably will not be as hung over from it as you were when you first had a taste of a cinematic 'Hangover'. **** Good",9,6,15,27 May 2011
Prisoners," 'Prisoners' is free from errors! Great thriller!
","I am not going to write too many sentences on 'Prisoners', so therefore I will set you free with not too many 'punalties' on my behalf. However, I do have to commend Director Denis Villenueve's brilliant thriller about a desperate father's actions after his daughter is missing. Hugh Jackman delivers the best performance of his career as the Pennsylvania working-class father Keller Dover. On a Thanksgiving, Dover and his wife and two kids were celebrating the holiday at their best friends' home who are the Birches.; I guess those Sons of Birches could not just celebrate the holiday by themselves. Kidding! On that sad day, the Dovers' young daughter Anna and the Birches' young daughter Eve went missing; a mysterious RV parked in front of the Birches' home might have had something to do with it. When the driver of the RV named Alex Jones is arrested as a possible suspect, Keller goes all 'cray cray' in order for the police not to release him even though there is not suffice evidence to book Jones. Jake Gyllenhaal co-stars as Detective Loki, who is not the real 'loco' in the picture, but does get obsessed to solve the case and find the missing girls. Villenueve's direction was superb and some might argue that he was sadly missing in the list of Oscar- nominated film directors for 2013. Aaron Guzilowski's screenplay was pure, even though 'Prisoners' sometimes got locked up with some clich√©s. It was great to see Jackman hide those big nails and singing voice, and transform himself into a character where he wore his emotions on his sleeve, and Hugh better believe that Jackman delivered the goods with his outstanding performance here. Gyllenhaal was also very good as Loki, as he continues his stellar acting career. Melissa Leo was stunning as the mysterious Aunt of Alex Jones; And speaking of Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones- Paul Dano delivered another effective cringe-worthy work as Alex Jones. Roger Deakins' cinematography of 'Prisoners' was a scenic tour-de-force, even though I think that Deakins' 'arrested development' of not getting the Oscars he deserves is a cinetragedy. OK, so I did write way too many pun-induced sentences for 'Prisoners' after all; I guess that was a 'hard cell' for you to believe I wouldn't. However, it is an easy sale for me to recommend the excellent 'Prisoners'. ***** Excellent",9,1,2,18 January 2014
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Movie You Have To Watch In A Trans State!
","`Hedwig & The Angry Inch' is the story of a transsexual vigorous singer and his or should I say her quest for fame, love, and acceptance. The film did have its comical gay moments, but I thought it was not all that it was cracked up to be.  Director-star John Cameron Mitchell did execute a heads up performance but his direction did lack effective narration. All in all, what this translates to is an average film about a transsexual that might transgress some viewers taste. *** Average",6,1,5,24 January 2002
Big Fish," Burton is The Fisher King!
","Director Tim Burton's surreal & illusionary cinematic techniques have taken us to mystical lands such as: Gotham City, Planets of Apes, Scissor Worlds, Edywood, and Mars. However, mainstream film buffs have been appalled by Burton's outlandish direction. Along comes `Big Fish', Burton's latest flick. Without a doubt, this is Burton's most mainstream film. `Big Fish' will hook those conservative moviegoers along with Burton's cult fanatics. Ewan Mcgregor stars as Ed Bloom. Ed is definitely not a late `bloomer' because of his vivid life and the eccentric characters he befriends along the way. Albert Finney co-stars as the late `bloomer; or should I say the older Ed Bloom who tells his suspicious off-center life tales to his estranged son. The tales might sound fishy to his son Will, played by Billy Crudup, but he listens to them because of his dad's near mortal condition. Alison Lohman, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Devito round out the acting pond in this thespian school of fish. `Big Fish' possesses sentimental humanistic elements unseen in Burton's previous films. The film, which runs to 130 minutes, could have been shorter in duration but `Big Fish' is still worth the bait. **** Good",8,2,2,18 June 2004
The Dark Knight," The Super of all superhero films!
","Hello ladies and gentleman, hopefully with this punned-filled review of 'The Dark Knight' I will be tonight's entertainment; OK I am 'joking'. Here we go: The Caped Crusader has returned with a complex and cerebral narrative on his 'battery' adventures, but in the end to quote his colorful nemesis 'It's simple really'- 'The Dark Knight' is the best superhero film of all-time. The very good Christian, Bale that is, is back as Batman. There is no reason to 'bale' him out in the Batman persona because undoubtedly Christian Bale continues to prove that he is the best Batman thespian to put on the dark leather metallic tights. The aforementioned 'colorful nemesis' could be none other than The Joker. I am not joking when I do say Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker might be the best supporting acting in movie history. Heath's sinister but charismatic work was a scene-stealing tour-de-force for every turn his Joker acting scene card was dealt. The last thing you want to do is overexploit a joker, so kudos to Director Christopher Nolan for giving The Joker the right amount of screen time. Speaking of the Batman auteur, Nolan's masterful direction of 'The Dark Knight' was the closer in getting him knighted as one of the best movie directors of the present generation. Nolan has garnered momentum on every film he has directed since he helmed what else but the indie classic 'Memento'. It would be very hypocritical of me if I did not mention the spectacular acting face-job proficiently executed by Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two Face. The rest of the Knight acting crew also delivered good knight performances including: Maggie Gyllenhaal as Batman's main gal Rachel Dawes, Michael Caine as the every pennyworth Batman butler Alfred Pennyworth, Gary Oldman as the not-so-flashy but so astute Lt. Gordon, Morgan Freeman as the Batman costume designer/techno-master Lucius Fox, and Eric Roberts as arrogant mobster Salvatore Marone. Oh, I think I forgot to mention something about a plot! I waited this long just so I can mention that Christopher & Jonathan Nolan's knightly script about Batman fighting the corrupted mobbing streets of Gotham, fighting his moral dilemma of what constitutes a city savior, fighting his heart in trying to recapture Rachel away from boyfriend Dent, and most of all fighting a make-up crazed psychopath is a proved winner as one of the super screenplays of the year. Time for me to 'get techy with it'; because 'The Dark Knight's' technical work (Cinematography, Art Direction, Make-Up, and Sound Mixing) was technologically stupendous. I do hear Oscar calling now Heath (in heaven), Nolan, and many of the film's technical masters because I smell a great night at the next Academy Awards for 'The Dark Knight'. Now if you are in the minority and have not seen 'The Dark Knight', do yourself a favor and get a bat and hit yourself (kidding, why soooo serious?), just travel to the dark side and see 'The Dark Knight' tonight! ***** Excellent",10,2,5,21 July 2008
Into the Wild," Wild Thing! You pull my heartstrings!
","'Into The Wild' is not based on the astonishing true story of wild choral-child Britney Spears nocturnal escapades in The Bipolar Express. 'Into The Wild' is not even based on the 'asstonishing' true story of wild Governor-manchild Eliot Spitzer's nocturnal escapades in The Emperor's Club. 'Into The Wild' is really based on the astonishing true story of wild child Christopher McCandless who abandoned his possessions, gave his entire $24,000 savings to charity, and hitchhiked to Alaska to live in the wilderness. Just like Britney and Spitzer, his 'assets' get frozen because of his desire to roam free. Director Sean Penn's compelling film pulls into the heartstrings on the quest of ultimate solitary freedom. 'Into The Wild' is more into the journey that McCandless took within the friendships he experienced on his hitchhiking route to Alaska. That roster included an affectionate middle-age hippy couple, a fast-talking farmer, and a lonesome geriatric widower. McCandless does reach the apex of solitaire euphoria when he encounters an isolated wrecked bus in Alaska which in turn he calls The Magic Bus. Chris becomes The Who of the Magic Bus by living in it until the song stops playing in his life. It is no secret on what happens to Chris so I am not playing spoiler when I say The Magic Bus becomes The Tragic Bus because he dies in it because of a poisonous fruit he ingested. Chris was eventually going to die anyway from lack of nourishment, so I guess Chris picked his poison. His fragile body was so emaciated that a slight 'McCandless in The Wind' would have tipped him over. Emile Hirsch's courageous performance as McCandless was enthralling enough to be into the best male leading acting efforts of the year. Hirsch lost an enormous amount of weight for the role; I guess he must have eaten many 'Hirschy Bars' to gain the weight back. Hirsch's roadie entourage were also into the acting: Hal Holbrook broke our hearts by effectively portraying the emotional senior Ron Franz, Vince Vaughn's 'vaughnisms' talked the talk and walked the walk as farmer Wayne, and Catherine Keener & Brian Dierker's performances as the hippy Rainey & Jan were hip hip hooray! William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden as the desperate McCandless parents and Jena Malone as the philosophical McCandless also were into their supporting acting. Eric Gautier's gorgeous scenic cinematography was as cold as ice at times but warm at heart at others. Eddie Vedder of Peal Jam jammed it in with a high score by contributing a nicely-tuned thematic musical score for what 'Into The Wild' entails. However, it was the Pennmanship of Writer-Director Sean Penn that revitalized Christopher McCandless incredible journey into cinematic reality! I hope I got you into the mood to go 'Into The Wild'. ***** Excellent",10,2,6,23 March 2008
Pride & Prejudice," I do not mind that it got Keira'd away!
","'Sense & Sensibility' is a Jane Austen literary classic that has been adapted for the electronic media copious times. The story is about the Bennett family which are comprised of sisters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, Lydia and of course pop/mum Mr. & Mrs. Bennett. This capricious tale about how the sisters relentlessly seek future husbands could have easily been re-titled 'Sister Act'. The latest film version of 'Sense & Sensibility' stars Keira Knightley as the jovial but practical Elizabeth. Matthew Macfadyen co-stars as the legendary Mr. Darcy, the wealthy but snobby bachelor who bumps heads and eventually hearts with the innocent Pink Lizzy herself. What made sense about 'Sense & Sensibility' was the admirable acting of Knightley and the cool magnetism of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett. What I felt was senseless about 'Sense & Sensibility' was the atrocious acting efforts of everyone else! It was like my first cooking experiment! Overdone!!!!!!!! Director Joe Wright does moderately bring in the 'wright' stuff in adapting this demanding tale to the big screen. However, it was the KK plan or otherwise known as the Keira Knightley experiment that brought vivacity to 'Sense & Sensibility'. *** Average",7,1,4,17 December 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Spotless is Errorless!
","I am eternally grateful that I am in the conscientious state of mind to review the phenomenon of an avant-guarde film that is 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. Not even the memory erasers of Lacuna can wipe my retrospection of this grand pelicula. Wait a second! What is happening? the Lacuna memory-wipers have snatched me! There has been a misunderstanding! I said i did not want this procedure done to me, Lacuna! Do not do this! What I meant is that people who are trepidated by 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' are being babies and they belong in 'la cuna'! Help meeeeee! Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #1: This innovative flick stars Jim Carrey as (man, what was his name in the movie? I think it had something to do with me!) Oh yes! His name is Joel! Man, that is my name! Joel is timid & sequestered (not me!), he drives a gray Toyota (me!), and wants to erase the memory of his last romantic relationship from his mind (always me! except the sex scenes! might need those for future self-help exercises!) Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #2: That Titanic actress with those titillating tits co-stars as Clementine. Oh my darling, Clementime! What is her name? I can't 'win' since I am 'let'ting the Lacuna technicians erase my memory. That is it! 'Win' 'Let'! Kate Winslet!!!!!!!! Yes! Clementine is the impulsive eccentric who first opts for the Lacuna procedure in order to erase her memory of her romance with Joel (which most of the girls I have gone out with have also opted to do). Joel (Meeza) Memory Erasing Phase #3: Living screen writing genius Charlie Chaplin has written another clever script that clearly is unforgettable! Wait! His name is not Charlie Chaplin! It's Charlie something! (I start to cough repeatedly). 'Man', I must stop 'cough'ing! That is it! 'Cough' 'Man' Kauffman!!!!!! His name is Charlie Kaufman! Yes!!!!! Eat your heart out Lacuna! End of Memory Erasing! OK, I had my fun! I think I should stop these memory erasing puns before all of you erase this review very soon! To sum it all up, Carrey and Winslet's performances were exceptional and will be embedded in your cerebral cortex for days! That is no case of brain damage! Not to far off are the remarkable supporting acting contributions of Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and Elijah Wood. They all play the Lacuna technicians who are in no doubt Lacuna Lunatics. Jon Brion's musical film score scores high points as the best film score of the year! Last but not least, we cannot forget the directorial brainyman of 'Eternal Sunshine'. That would be French Director Michel Gondry! He had a 'Gondre' task to achieve in directing a Kauffman script and he was able to do it masterfully! 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' take on: fervency, anamnesis, subsistence, loneliness, and exigency cleaned house with originality to make this film spotless in cinematic magnanimity. ***** Excellent",9,0,1,4 January 2005
Taken," What a take!
","As I finally woke up to the sleeper action movie hit of the year 'Taken', I was taken by surprise on how immensely entertaining this narrative is. Sure it does incorporate various faux action tactics by the lead action character, but you know what? I'll take it! Liam Neeson stars as retired CIA Agent Bryan Mills who might be the best of the action heroes to arrive in the cinematic millennium. It's not so what Mills can do, is what he cannot do. He is sharp, cerebral, dynamic, skilled, swift¬Ö just to give you a few takes on his strengths. Mills' CIA training definitely comes in handy when his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is what else 'taken' on a Paris vacation by an Albanese gang for slave trade. Thereafter, Daddy Mills puts on his vengeance suit and off to Paris he goes to rescue his daughter and take down the malos. Does the Mills prevail? Well, I can't take that away from you by providing you the answer. You are going to take it all in cinematic stride by watching 'Taken'. Director Pierre Morel excelled in orchestrating action sequences in 'Taken' with his rapid style. Sure no CIA agent could realistically be as skilled as Mills and sometimes his marvel proficiency seemed more illusory than authentic. But we could say the same for 'Die Hard' machismo John McClane and many other infamous action heroes. So we should all take it with a grain of salt, and ask ourselves 'Is this plain action movie fun?' I sure thought so! I am glad the protagonist role was taken by veteran actor Liam Neeson! He was, to simply say it, 'kick ass' as Mills. 'Taken' will not capture everyone, especially those nitpicking critics, but I was sure taken in on this 90 minute action entertainment ride. OK, that was my last take for the compelling 'Taken'. ***** Excellent",9,2,2,20 July 2009
Alice in Wonderland," Meeza in Punderland writes about the awful 'Alice in Wonderland'
","Director Tim Burton's long-awaited film adaptation of 'Alice in Wonderland' is finally here! And ouch! What a disappointment! Unfortunately, Alice is malice in boringland. We all know the trippy story of 'Alice in Wonderland' so I will devoid this review the Wonderland narrative (Google: 'Lewis Carroll book' in case you want to be reminded of it). The visually stunning and conceptually enthralling movie somehow had too much pot I mean plot to give me a cinematic high. Burton inserted way too many pseudo-eccentric characters in the flick for one to really get absorbed in their wonderland. I wonder why? Let's just say the movie's Cheshire Cat, Dormouse, March Hare, Blue Caterpillar, Bayard, White Rabbit (didn't I go there a couple of years ago for my bachelor party), and Tweedledee & Tweedledum (contrary to popular belief, not played by George Bush & Dick Cheney) did not do it for me. But the character I wanted to white out the most from the screen was the lackluster White Queen; probably had something to do with Anne Hathaway's asinine performance as the pale one. No, I am not going mad- I have not forgotten The Mad Hatter! My jury is still out on The Mad Hatter but let's just say I was expecting more of a charismatic Hatter character from the eccentric thespian maestro Johnny Depp. Mr. Hatter was captivating at first but after a while Depp's 'more of the same' performance became more of a persistent hat trick that did not achieve its gravitating goal. I must say that the villainous bigheaded Red Queen was my favorite character in the movie due to her grandiose livid reactions expressed in that petite frame, priceless! Helena Bonham Carter's performance as the Red Queen might just get her a red carpet trip as a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominee at next year's Oscars. OK, maybe not, but Bighead Red did red-rock. Oh, and there is that Alice chic. Mia Wasikowska's starring performance as Alice was as lifeless as acting could be. Her sterile & immobile characterization of Alice made one wish that Alice would shoot down a few shots of Tequila & some Red Bulls in Boogie Wonderland in order to enliven her up! I wonder what hypnotic drugs Linda Woolverton was taking (or for that matter not taking) when she scribed up the unnecessarily-complex adapted screenplay based on a children's tale that is 'Alice in Wonderland'. The Art Direction, Cinematography, and Visual Effects of the movie were its strong suits, and do merit high praise. But that is not enough to give 'Alice in Wonderland' a storybook-ending favorable review. ** Needs Improvement",6,6,14,6 March 2010
Avatar," I see you... Please read my 'Avatar' pun-filled review!!
","True Blue, baby I love you. Well, I would not go that far but those Cameron crazies are definitely milking the love of James Cameron's long-awaited science fiction phenom 'Avatar'. It is racking in the millions, and will probably sink Cameron's 'Titanic' as the most profitable film of all time. 'Avatar' is Cameron's vision of a planet named Pandora inhabited by the Na'vi tribe; a blue-skinned, yellow-eyed humanoid race with their own language, culture, and spirituality. The only difference that 'In The Na'vi' you cannot put your mind at ease since they exactly do not put up the welcome mats to the general human race. That is where the Avatarados come in! The Avatar program is one where they mix the DNA of humans and Na'vis to convert into the look of a Navi and mechanically zip your way into Pandora's Box. Our 'Avatar' hero is Jake Sully, a paraplegic war veteran, who in exchange for some legs promised by a ruthless Colonel Quaritch, enters the Avatar program to infiltrate the Na'vi people so the human army can conquer Planet Pandora. Sully however does not follow the Avatar game plan and ends up bonding with the Na'vis and falls in love with the beautiful Na'vette, Neytiri. I guess Neytiri did give Jake some blueballs during their 'whoopee' session. Anyway, Sully becomes more connected to his Avatar self than his real self. The Army of greedy humans become disconcerted with Jake's Na'vi love and decide to overcome the tribe with grandiose mechanical machines. Jake & the Na'vis are not alone in this fight. Jake also has his Avatar mates to aid him: the Avatar expert scientist Dr. Grace Augustine and the smarty sidekick Norm Spellman. Not to mention the sarcastic female Private Trudy Chacon who rebels against Colonel Quatrich's ruthless antics to eradicate the Na'vi tribe. Director James Cameron's titanic direction of 'Avatar' is one revolutionary wizardry piece of work that is definitely groundbreaking in the future of the science fiction genre. The film's Art Direction, Cinematography, Make-Up, and Special Effects- not to get too technical, was a technical masterpiece. Sam Worthington as Sully and Zoe Saldana as Neytiri were solid with their starring performances. Worthington was worthy with his sly work and Saldana was not 'killing Zoe' with her expressive thespian effort. The supporting acting of 'Avatar' did not make me blue also. Most notably: Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Augustine and Michelle Rodriguez as Chacon. However, the villainous Colonel Quartich was played a bit over the top by Stephen Lang. My only true blue note of 'Avatar' was Cameron's monotonous screenplay; especially during the Sully & Neytiri so-called love scenes, a bit too Pocahontas-like for my taste. But 'Avatar' is not primarily about the words is about the vision. And I see you, I mean I see 'Avatar' as an epical science fiction film that will stand the test of time in the history of motion pictures. **** Good",8,0,3,18 January 2010
Selma," It has many rights!
","I vote 'Yes' for 'Selma' as a quality biographical movie, and that is my cinematic civil right to do so. Now I will try to be civil as much as possible, but I liked this movie better when it was called 'Lincoln'. I am kidding! Please don't start the protest. All kidding aside, 'Selma' is an important piece of filmmaking that chronicles Dr. Martin Luther King's campaign to secure equal voting rights via an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama in 1965. Like 'Lincoln', 'Selma' is the kind of movie that should be shown to every high school student in their American History class. Director Ava DuVernay might just be marching on to more directorial gigs with her accurate orchestration of the picture. Paul Webb's screenplay of 'Selma' marched on to the applicable verbal beat of the story it was telling. Oye esto, David Oyelowo was majorly snubbed of a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his triumphant performance as Dr. King. I don't want to get too political but Tom Wilkinson and Tim Roth pitched in with solid supporting performances, respectively as President Lyndon B. Johnson and Governor George Wallace. Now, 'Selma' is not a 'I have a dream of a perfect movie' type of film, but I still think you should march on to it.**** Good",Null,1,2,24 January 2015
The Artist," The premier piece of art of 2011!
","No one can silence me on expressing my jubilant emotion on the silent masterpiece modern movie 'The Artist'. It is pure artistry. So therefore, I have to voice that to me it is the best movie of 2011; and I am not the only who has been vociferous with that sentiment. 'The Artist' stars a brilliant Jean Dujardin as silent movie star George Valentin. During the silent movie era of Hollywood, everyday was Valentine's Day for Valentin as he was admired & loved as that era's supreme movie star. Valentin was confident, charismatic, determined, and pretty much a pure silent showman. However, it was all the future talk that ended up ruining Valentin's career. When the silent movie days of Hollywood dwindled, and the talkies became the talk of Tinseltown, Valentin became a movie face of the past. After Valentin gets booted by the movie studio he was under contract with for many years, he decides to keep the silence alive by developing a silent film which he produces, directs, and stars in. When that experiment bombed, all kept spiraling downwards for poor Silent George; he loses his house, his wife, his fame, and even to a certain extent his legacy. At the same time- Peppy Miller, an aspiring actress which George had given her first break by briefly appearing in one of his last silent movies, becomes a megastar in the new Hollywood talkies. I guess one can say that her Peppy Talk was the talk of Hollywood. George and Peppy's careers go through opposite pathways, even though Peppy continues to admire George even throughout all his trials & tribulations. The epitome of man's best friend has to be George's cerebral dog who is not only George's pooch confidant but eventually his savior. Director Michel Hazanivicius' orchestration of 'The Artist' is one for the ages and for all ages. He is able to formulate a wondrous silent movie in modern times and to make it as magnetic and enticing as it is was simply movie magic. It is the best direction of the year and it will be very hazardous if Hazanivicius does not garner a Best Director Oscar. Moreover, the vicious Hazanivicius also pulls of another cinematic impossible- scribing a spectacular and lively screenplay to a modern silent film; translation= Another Oscar. There is a lot to love about Dujardin's expressive starring performance as Valentin. Dujardin is definitely due a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Berenice Bejo was very nice with her stellar work as Peppy Miller, there is no doubt that Bejo won't be to lejo of the Kodak Theatre come Oscar time; she is a shoe-in for a Best Supporting Actress nomination. 'The Artist' also got more support from the great 'silent but medley' performances of John Goodman as the studio mogul, James Cromwell as George's chauffeur, and Penelope Ann Miller as Mrs. Valentin. Another guiding force in 'The Artist' was the grand musical score of the flick orchestrated by Ludovic Bource. The Bource Musical Identity was of Bource Supremacy and the sound of this music should rejoice in the Oscar mountaintops with an Academy Award for Best Movie Score. Many have called 'The Artist' a love letter to 'old school' Hollywood. And yes I do concur with that analysis, but the new school of Hollywood should reward 'The Artist' as the movie valedictorian of the year 2011. So go ahead and¬Ö. enjoy the silence! ***** Excellent",10,4,6,29 December 2011
Invictus," This South Africa story kicks (u know what)!
","I invite everyone to witness the inspiring human factors of the brilliant film 'Invictus'. The narrative is based on real life events in South Africa during the mid 90's. During that time, newly elected South African President Nelson Mandela tried to pull the rug out of the carpet by taking a keen interest in the country's mostly-white Rugby team in hopes of uniting a post-apartheid South Africa; and that is as clear as black & white during the movie. Mandela unites with the team's captain Francois Pienaar to fulfill this, and their scenes together is the apex of the film's supremacy. To this day, Nelson is one cool rocking fellow! Morgan Freeman's superb performance as Mandela was not an imitation but a personification of one of history's most respected leaders. Freeman plays the recently freeman Mandela of the 90's with precise authenticity. Matt Damon was captivating as Pienaar, and his Mandela-inspired capitan character scored high points thanks to Mr. D's brilliant work. But the ultimate human factor of 'Invictus' was the exceptional direction of the legendary Clint Eastwood; it never ceases to amaze me how he continues to be so good, so baaadass, but never ugly in his career's twilight time. The Richness of Eastwood strikes again. Anthony Peckham's screenplay was infiltrated with typical sports & humane clich√©s, but it did not peck away from the film's central goodwill focus. I will also not evict Tom Stern's cinematography and Tom Hannam's art direction from the 'Invictus' cinematic goodwill house anytime soon; I was dazzled by their meticulous efforts on the film's look. So unite and free yourself from the oppressions of boredom and visit 'Invictus' today! ***** Excellent",9,2,4,30 December 2009

'La La Land' is a beautiful film, and a love letter to classic Hollywood. Chazelle marvels with his stylish direction and orchestration of the picture. His screenplay was a musical gem of art. Ryan Gosling was outstanding as Sebastian, but it was Emma Stone as Mia that please 'mamma Mia' must get an Oscar nomination for her brilliant performance. This perfect picture is a must watch for all, so set your mind to 'La La Land'. ***** Excellent",10,5,12,17 December 2016
Super 8," Super!
","Super 8, 8, 8, I love you Super 8, give it to me Super 8. OK, I sound like a silly Celi Bee there (only hardcore 70's Disco fans got that opening). But it is true! Summer Popcorn Cinematic Entertainment a la 70's style is alive and well in J.J. Abrams 'Super 8'. The movie's executive producer is Steven Spielberg, and why not because 'Super 8' has Super Spielberg written all over it. Before its release, the film's plot points were supposed to be kept super secret, and even in the trailers all one would see is a railroad trailer of a grandiose train crash. So I don't want you to super-hate me, so I will not reveal too much of Super 8's plot during my review. I will inform you that if you are an aficionado of 'E.T.', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', 'Poltergeist', 'The Goonies', and 'Jurassic Park', you will also become a super fan of 'Super 8'. The film is based during the late 70's in an Ohio town. A few Middle School kids are filming an 8 millimeter short film to help their peep Charles, who is directing it, so it can be entered in a youth film contest. But during its roll, the kids witness a colossal train wreck. After that, havoc runs amok and bizarre occurrences start occurring in the town. The town's deputy sheriff Jackson Lamb is now in the center of the madness trying to investigate what is going on. The train wreck and the town's strange happenings do have a connection, but I will not wreck it for you by providing information on that either. The movie's primary focus is on the kids though; the film is primarily presented through their subjective responses to all the madness that is going on, especially those of the tween protagonists Joe Lamb (yep, the Deputy Sheriff's son), and the young girl he crushes on Alice Dainard. All the other kids do play an integral though. So what is the mystery of the train wreck and how it affected Jackson Lamb and his son Joe Lamb? Not gonna tell you! It will be my Silence of the Lambs. I will say that J.J. Abrams' direction & screenplay of this super flick will have you on the edge of your seat, you will not be derailed with flat boredom or insignificant subplots; every aspect of the film bears semblance and swiftly aids in the progress of the narrative. Turn out the Friday Night Lights because Kyle Chandler has now entered into the movies playing field quite nicely with his game performance as Jackson Lamb. Nice to see Ron Eldard back in the thespian game with an impressive effort as Alice's dad Louis. But it is the kids that dominate 'Super 8'! I am not kidding! Whopper performances all around- Joel Courtney as Joe Lamb, Elle Fanning as Alice Dainard, Riley Griffiths as Charles; Ryan Lee, Gabriel Basso, and Zach Mills were the other kiddos who round out the young thespian super crew of 'Super 8'. So get behind the 8 ball or at least your vehicle, and drive to the nearest multiplex to witness the 'Super 8' phenomenon! ***** Excellent",Null,0,0,11 July 2011
The Last Samurai," Cruise Cuts!
","There were not an overabundance of moviegoers which bowed to `The Last Samurai'. The film was a moderate box office disappointment despite the fact it starred megastar Tom Cruise. Did Cruise make a risky business decision in taking on a Japanese epic? Did he feel aggravated that the film did not show him the money? Was it a mission impossible for `The Last Samurai' to obtain blockbuster status? Let me cut to the chase: `The Last Samurai' stars Cruise as Nathan Algren, a 19th century Civil War soldier who takes on a job in training a Japanese army in battling Samurais. In a fierce battle, Algren `sword' of gets held captive by the Samurais. Through a gradual & grueling process, he is befriended and welcomed by the Samurai nation and ends up being `sword' of a Samurai himself. Ken Watanabe co-stars as Katsumoto, the fearless & commanding Samurai leader. Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nod for his performance here. He had a tyrannical presence here, but I think the nod was not deserving. I `sword' `watanabe' Sam Rockwell of `Matchstick Men' to had received the Best Supporting Actor nod instead. The masterful components of `The Last Samurai' was its breathtaking cinematography, ingratiating sound editing, and cultural costume design. A few critics felt that the Academy was crude to Cruise by overlooking him for a Best Actor nomination. Tommy Boy's sensible & courageous work was notable but not for him to cruise a Best Actor nod. Director Edward Zwick is one slick director with all the effort he put into the film.  All in all, `The Last Samurai ` was quite lengthy and should have `cut' some scenes out, but it still displayed luminous filmmaking qualities. *** Average",7,0,1,4 August 2004
Up," What's Uuuuuuuuuppp? This movie is!
","Upsy daisy! It's time for you to wake up and read my quirky pun-induced film review of Disney Pixar's 'Up'. Not up for it? Come on, it will lift your spirits up! OK, enough uppers already! Do not want it to be a downer for you guys. 'Up' is yet another creative Pixar tale about a lonely geriatric widower named Carl Frederickson who fixates on fulfilling his deceased wife Ellie's wishes of flying their house to a paradisiacal land in South America. This idea might not fly with many, but grumpy Carl just wants to be happy by his lonesome in his own isolated South America Paradiso. However, Carl did not expect a junior wilderness explorer to come along for the ride. What's up with that? Russell is the aforementioned boy scout who accidentally gets stuck in the house during Carl's upward liftoff. Nevertheless, Frederickson was in no mood to be 'bringing down the house' even with Russell on board. Frederickson and Russell end up landing in the paradise land (house and all), and there they befriend a talking dog named Dug and an eccentric female bird who Russell names Kevin. Their nemesis comes in the form of the devious explorer Charles Muntz who masters a pack of menacing talking dogs. So therefore, Frederickson and Russell are confronted with plenty of 'ups' and 'downs' during their adventurous experience. There are many humanistic elements in 'Up' such as aging, loneliness, acceptance, and detachment that many kids might not be up for; but provides invaluable life lessons on character education to our future generation. 'Up' does play with your heartstrings plenty, so bring a hanky! The former Mr. Grant, Ed Asner, was granted a perfect role to voice as Frederickson; that impressed me Ed Asner! (Only 'Tonight Show with Jay Leno' fans got that pun upper). Bob Peterson's tender & uplifting screenplay was superb while Pete Docter doctored a successful directorial uperation of 'Up'. Big Thumbs Up for 'Up'! ***** Excellent",9,2,4,8 June 2009
Woman in Gold," I give it a Bronze!
","The true-story based drama 'Woman in Gold' did not deserve any gold medals, but was bronzely deserved as solid cinematic offering. Helen Mirren stars as Maria Altmann, an older woman who was a Jewish refugee in her homeland of Austria. Her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer sang the original version of Adele's 'Hello'; not even Lionel Richie sang it better! Hello! Hello! Are you still there? Please don't say goodbye yet to my review of 'Woman in Gold'. In all seriousness, Adele Bloch- Bauer was the subject of an infamous painting during the 1940's. However, that painting and much artwork of Maria's family was seized by the Nazis in Germany-occupied Austria. During the late 1990's after a few occurrences including a deep letter from her deceased aunt Adele, Maria decides that it's time to get what is rightfully hers; most notably the startling 'Woman in Gold' painting, in that time displayed in an Austrian museum. So Maria hires a nice young Jewish lawyer named Randy Schoenberg, and their fight for art-recovery justice is in full plight as they tackle many obstacles, most notably the Austrian government, to recover to Maria what is rightfully hers. Director Simon Curtis does hold par in his orchestration of the picture, even though Simon says way too many times what is obvious. Alexi Kaye Campbell's screenplay was moderate at best, but shined brightly within Maria's charismatic dialogue. Helen Mirren did shine with a golden performance as Maria, and Ryan Reynolds deserved a silver-thespian medal with his work as Randy Schoenberg. 'Woman in Gold' does paint a pretty picture on art justice, and though not perfect, still deserves a look. *** Average",7,1,2,2 April 2017
Love & Mercy," Nice little deuce coupe of a flick!
","The bio flick 'Love & Mercy' tells the tale of the professional and personal life of Brian Wilson, one of the key members of the infamous Beach Boys band. OK, so let's do the math here, I do include an enormous amount of puns in my movie reviews, and I am reviewing a movie about a Beach Boys member. So you know what that means, will have 'puns, puns, puns' til my readers start to run away!!! Anyways, Wilson's challenging dilemma was no laughing matter. He battled schizophrenia throughout most of his adult life. Director Bill Pohlad marveled in presenting a double-sided chronology to Wilson's story; first as a young successful songwriter/producer/member of the Beach Boys who thought that 'wouldn't it be nice' for the band to transform into a more avant- garde sound which dismayed his Wilson brother bandmates, but most notably his cousin bandmate Mike Love. Paul Dano's performance as the younger Dano was right on key. On the flip side, John Cusack magnificently plays the older Wilson who was already diagnosed with full-fledged schizophrenia and is profoundly controlled by his psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Landy. When the older Wilson meets Melinda Ledbetter, a former model turned car saleswoman, it simply leads to better times for the mentally ailing Wilson; but not without a control fight from Team Landy; let's just say Dr. Landy was a real kokomierda. 'Love & Mercy' is an excellent piece, but not a perfect film; the screenplay at times was bit disoriented and repetitious. But from the instant, I picked up 'good vibrations' from the supersonic performances from John Cusack and Paul Dano as the Brians, and ledbeter not forget Elizabeth Banks rousing work as Melinda. 'God only knows' how people can take so many puns in movie reviews, but 'don't worry baby' because I'm just about done here. 'Love & Mercy' is worth riding its cinematic wave; in other words, it's beaching, I mean bitching! ***** Excellent",9,1,3,17 September 2015
Limitless," Not limitless with mediocrity!
","I give you fair warning before you continue reading; I just took a verbal pill called UPP (Unlimited Pun Power) which can enhance pun memory to 100 percent, instead of the mere 20 percent we punners use. So there will be no pun limit in this review! Before you stray away, I must state that I am joking. I included that 'pillacious' entry because that is the main premise of the flick 'Limitless'. It stars Bradley Cooper as Eddie Morra, a down-on-his-luck struggling writer who runs into his ex- brother law who introduces Eddie to a limitless memory pill that is able to use 100 percent of brain power. Morra, Morra, Morra how do you like it? How do you like it? Even though that sounded more like an Andrea True Connection, the real connection that Eddie has with the drug is precisely to want more of it. The top-secret pill, called NZT, is Eddie's meal ticket to break into the brokerage business and rise to the top; which is what precisely happens. I will not divulge any more info on where the NZT leads Eddie to, but I will say that situations get incredibly zany when a Russian mobster also gets his hands on the pill among other messy situations; so zany in fact that the movie starts losing its semi-validity because of it. And that is where Director Neil Burger got a bit fried in cooking up 'Limitless'; however, Burger was king in a few scenes in helming the movie, especially the scenes in displaying the power of NZT in Eddie. As far as the 'Limitless' scribe goes, unfortunately I do have to prescribe a dose of authenticity to Leslie Dixon's cluttered screenplay. Bradley Cooper shows he can carry a movie as best as he can with his strong leading performance as Eddie Morra; and it was fortunate that Bradley did not overdose with 'over- the-top' thespian antics in his work in 'Limitless'. Robert DeNiro's supporting work as a CEO executive who recruits Morra for a merger was a bit bland and needed a few uppers. But who am I to criticize the great Robert DeNiro! And Abbie Cornish was very much underutilized as Morra's on-and-off girlfriend Lindy. So yea, my critical bag is mixed when it comes to my 'Limitless' reactions. But if you can stand the few highs and several lows of this movie, then I think you might be ready to pop in 'Limitless' to your system. *** Average",7,1,2,29 December 2012
Eyes Wide Shut," #1 Film of 1999 Without A Doubt!!!!!
","Wake up! And open your eyes wide open! And go see 'Eyes Wide Shut.' Why you say? Because without a doubt, Director Stanley Kubrick's final masterpiece is one of the best films of all time. I know many close-minded moviegoers who have gone see the film are probably telling me to keep my mouth wide shut. Yea! I know! It is not for the usual bubble gum movie fan. But if you are into craftsmanship, creativeness, visuals, design, and symbolism in moviemaking then this is the film for you. The film is about a successful New York couple who display their passions and jealousies through erotic dreams and voyeuristic adventures. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman deliver Oscar-worthy performances. Also, co-star Sydney Pollack stands firm with his too. This Kubrick masterpiece contains the most mesmerizing scene of the year. It will definitely excite you in more ways than one! The elegant but sometimes mysterious music in the film is one of its best assets.  Director Stanley Kubrick has definitely saved his best for last! The light should have been shining on him at Oscar time when the Best Director winner was announced. You will do a very bad, bad thing if you don't check out 'Eyes Wide Shut.'   ***** Excellent",10,0,1,9 May 2000
Sicario," A hit!!!
","Director Denis Villeneuve has imported in a tour-de-force picture in 'Sicario'. The movie stars Emily Blunt as FBI Agent Kate Mercer. She is recruited by the mercy (sort of, kind of) of a U.S. government task force to aid in the escalating war against drugs at the border area between the U.S. and Mexico. Half mercy on Mercer because even though she volunteered for the journey, this is not what she envisioned it to be. Josh Brolin co-stars as the Government Agent Matt Graver who does not want to dig his own grave in this dangerous mission, so he manipulates Mercer in ways I will not reveal. At the center of this mission, is the mysterious Alejandro played by Benicio Del Toro. Villeneuve marveled in his orchestration of 'Sicario' by keeping it tense and unpredictable. Taylor Sheridan's screenplay was a little bit of a bust, but not so much to lessen the movie's strength. Blunt delivers the best performance of her career as Mercer; and Mercy, Mercy, Me why in the world was she not nominated for a Best Actress Oscar! Brolin was his usual steady self in his work as Graver. Del Toro was the scene stealer of the movie though, and there were plenty of hits to that statement; I will just leave it at that. 'Sicario' is sic!! And A must see, so open your borders for it. ***** Excellent",10,3,5,14 July 2016
Departures," Do not depart from Departures
","I recollect at the Academy Awards last year when Japanese Director Yojiro Takita departed from his seat to accept the Best Foreign Language Picture Oscar. Many, yours truly included, were shocked that the frontrunner 'Waltz With Bashir' was upset by this small independent Japanese flick. I guess that was the last waltz for Bashir, and the Academy was turning Japanese, I think they were turning Japanese, I really think so. After experiencing 'Departures', I am glad the Academy veered that way. 'Departures' is a moving, endearing, and even semi-comical film about a young Japanese cellist named Daigo Kobayashi who gets unemployed from his orchestra gig. Therefore, he moves to his Japanese hometown with his wife where he takes a job in a funeral home preparing the dead for their departures. At first, he thinks that the job is travel oriented. But upon arrival to his departures job interview, he realizes that he has to be 'prettying up the dead' on a daily basis. However, 'Departures' does not depart from the humanistic narrative themes on Daigo still dealing with the hurt on being deserted by his father as a child, and his resiliency to support his newlywed wife Ikue. Director Takita and Screenwriter Kundo Kayama resurrect what could have a lifeless Japanese story with poignant affirming themes on: life appreciation, spirituality of a departure, and misconceptions of the field of funeral services. Takita does incorporate profound symbolist themes on the film's narrative with the cello, food, and stones. Japanese movie star Masahiro Motoki was mas de un hero with his engaging performance as Daigo. Motoki carried the film quite brilliantly. But I cannot depart from this film review by also stating that I do take a bow on the supporting acting ensemble of 'Departures', most notably: Tsutomu Yamakazi's performance as Daigo's funeral boss Ikuei Sasaki was of commanding variety, and Ryoko Hirosue work as Daigo's wife Ikue was more than Okaey. Takeshi Hamada's phenomenal scenic cinematography was also an asset to the film which I did not want my eyes to depart from. So arrive to a 'Departures' viewing as soon as you can. **** Good",8,2,2,31 January 2010
Les Mis√©rables," I dreamed a dream that this movie was better
","I really don't have problems with movie musicals. It is not my favorite film genre, but I do respect the musical. However, a little dialogue would be nice from time to time incorporated with the singing. There was very, very little of that in Director Tom Hooper's film adaptation of 'Les Miserables'. So therefore, that was one main reason why I felt miserable numerous times in experiencing 'Les Miserables'. As most of you are aware, the movie is adapted from Victor Hugo's infamous novel and Broadway show. It is set in 19th Century France and tells the story of Jean Valjean, a former thief who for decades was hunted down by ruthless policeman Javert after he breaks parole. Valjean agrees to care for factory worker Fantine's daughter Cosette. When Cosette grows older, she falls for revolutionist Marius who is set in standing strong against the tyranny of France. I wonder if Marius bought Cosette a corset and if they french kissed on the night of their prom. OK, those were some miserable puns! 'Les Miserables' seemed like it lasted an entire day. Hooper does a decent job in reconstructing the look of the time and also the technical efforts in the movie were solid. But Hooper's direction was not powerful enough to persuade viewers who are not fan of the musical to buy in to 'Les Miserables'. If one is a Miserables fan, no doubt you will adore this movie. I can't really comment too much on the movie's screenplay because it was pretty much nonexistent since most of the screen played to characters singing away their melancholy. Undoubtedly, Hugh Jackman is a renaissance man and it showed once more in his performance as Valjean; however, I do not call it Oscar-worthy; Hugh know what I mean? Many people seemed to be scarecrowed of Russell Crowe's singing in his work as Javert; but it's actually not that bad. Anne Hathaway is sure to pick up a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the doomed Fantine for her emotional performance. I loved her work, but I was mostly watching a buzzcut Hathaway on screen and not a total transformation into the Fantine character; hey, that is just my buzz. 'Les Miserables' includes other decent (though not spectacular) tenor performances from Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks as Eponine, and Amanda Seyfried as Cosette. I could have done without the ridiculous performances from Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter as Thenardier and Madame Thenardier. 'Les Miserables' is not the most miserable movie-going experience I have ever had; but if you are an avid fan of the infamous musical, you should not miz out in checking out Hooper's 'Les Miserables'. *** Average",6,2,6,13 January 2013
The Happening," M. Knight Happens!
","M. Night Shyamalan's latest suspense maze 'The Happening' did not happen to be a box office hit; unfortunate that happened. Because I did happen to enjoy Shyamalan's apocalyptic-type spooky flick of an eerie naturist phenomenon that causes Northeasterners to behave bewildered and then commit suicide. Mark Wahlberg stars as Elliot Moore, the small town Science Teacher who gets caught up in the middle of this suicidal mess with his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel). The Moores want less of this catastrophic fatal occurrence by trying to escape to where the happening is not happening. I have a sixth sense that Shyamalan is back at his supreme directorial game again by expertly helming 'The Happening' with unpredictable elements that have you stomped on what is going to happen next. Not much happening with the acting here, but this narrative is more of a director's den than an actor's playhouse. So I am not going to further comment on 'The Happening' because I think you need it to happen by hopping on over to discover Shyamalan's 'Happening' cinematic journey. ***** Excellent",9,10,19,26 August 2008
Mystic River," Mystical!
","Director Clint Eastwood has mystified us again with his new landmark film `Mystic River'. Cinemas around the country should let this river run for awhile to allow more audiences to sink in to this `Mystic River'. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon star as three childhood friends who are reunited once again in adulthood because of a hometown murder that will change their lives forever. Penn is remarkable as Jimmy Markum, the former town thug who seeks revenge for his daughter's murder. `What about the other two penn pals?' You ask. Kevin Bacon plays Sean Devine, the local detective who is investigating the murder; and Tim Robbins plays Dave Boyle, the unstable comrade who turns out to be the prime suspect. To a certain degree (try 6), one can say that Kevin brings home the bacon by cooking up the most appetizing performance of his assiduous career. As far as Tim Robbins is concerned, it would be highway robbery if Robbins is not nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. This not-so-tiny Tim delivers a grandiose performance. Also, Marcia Gay Harden gave me a Harden hard-on by pumping up her acting with precise affecting emotion as Dave's perplexed wife.  Laura Linney's work as Jimmy's wife was admiring but she did not have enough screen time for Academy Voters to `Think of Laura' when they select the Ssupporting Actress nominations. However, in the end `Mystic River' is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. Clint, who recently should have been unforgiven for his recent atrocious directorial pieces, redeemed himself and made my day with `Mystic River'. Clint was even generous enough to give Mcgruff the Crime Dog some screen time during the film's conclusive parade scene.

Zombieland," No Z's in Zombieland!
","The witty 'Zombieland' definitely did wake me up from my zombie state and was a real eye-opener. The film is set in the future where a deadly plague that converts people into zombies has set its mark in the USA. 'Take A Bite out of Slime' has superseded 'Take A Bite Out of Crime', sorry McGruff. Jesse Eisenberg stars as pseudo-name Columbus, a gabby, jittery unzombie who has set his own 'zombieland security' rules in order to defend himself against zombie attacks. Woody Harrelson co-stars as pseudo-name Tallahassee, a bad-ass 'zombie exterminator' who plays by his own 'zombieland security' rules which are more of the destroyer mode than Columbus' ones. The two coincidentally meet up in trying to search for locations that are 'zombie free'. In their journey, they meet up with a con-artist sister duet in Wichita and Little Rock, also pseudo-names, who are conniving in stealing property and dollars of the what's little left 'male zombie-free' population. Eventually, the fearsome foursome do converge in most of the narrative of 'Zombieland'. Director Ruben Fleischer revitalized the zombie genre with some juicy, sharp bites in his orchestration of the movie. Rhette Reese also did a credible job in instilling his reese's pieces in the amusing scribe of the flick. I don't want to be a 'plotbuster' but there is a cameo appearance of a comedic legend in 'Zombieland' that does earn the film its 'stripes'. Cheers to Woody Harrelson for his enigmatic performance as Tallahassee, and to Jesse Eisenberg for connecting quite well as Columbus in the 'Zombie Network'. Emma Stone continues to impress as a startling young actress, and her performance as Wichita was one I was wishing I could see more of. Abigail Breslin as Little Rock was no 'little miss sunshine' here, but she also delivered a fine performance. Hey, can't forget the Zombies! Kudos to those thousands of zombie extras that zom way had to make them believable. Hey, you just read a corny pun review of the film 'Zombieland'! What are you going to do now? I am going to 'Zombieland'!!! Or at least I am hoping you will. **** Good",8,1,3,17 October 2010
A Beautiful Mind," Simply Gorgeous!
","It was sure a happy day when I decided to see Director Ron Howard's new film `A Beautiful Mind'. This film is one that sure looks good to be one of the best of the year. The film stars Russell Crowe, and it is based on the real life story of John Nash. Nash is an ingenious mathematician who has had to battle with schizophrenia. Crowe's performance should equal another Best Actor Oscar nomination. His work was so good that I would not be surprised if he adds another oscar to his acting awards collection.  If you multiply Crowe's work by the very effective supporting performances by Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris, and Christopher Plummer it will not be odd to say that this is the best ensemble acting in film this year; even though I am also divided by the fine ensemble acting of `Memento', `Mulholland Drive' and `Sidewalks of New York'.  Director Ron Howard should also receive a Best Director Oscar nomination, and any academy members who disagrees with his nomination should be subtracted from the board. What all this adds up to is that `A Beautiful Mind' is a beautiful classic that you should not miss! ***** Excellent",10,0,2,2 January 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Smithy Good Time!
","The following film review analyzes the new Brad Pitt-Angelina Jolie vehicle 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' and at the same time it pays homage to the classic 80's new wave band 'The Smiths'. Why not? It has 'smithereens' written all over it! How soon should I start this review? I say 'How Soon is Now?' (Smiths' song). Most of you know that this film has been a real 'hit' with audiences! For those of you who have not been on the 'hit' list and are oblivious of what the film is about, it's about a married couple who are also a couple of contract killers! However, the real 'killer' part about this is that they are unaware of each other's deadly occupations. To add fuel to the fire, they have both been assigned to kill each other. I know some of you guys are sick of Brad & Angelina because 'Us' 'People' have been seeing the Bradgelina suspected romance in the covers of the aforementioned magazines just about every week. However, give 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' a chance. John Smith, played by Pitt, will go to no ends to make sure that he successfully completes his mission or in other words end up with a 'Girlfriend in a Coma' (Smiths' song) or in this case 'Wife in a Coma'. OK, I am pushing it! I am being a comamierda! Jane Smith, played by Jolie, is also on a continuous relentless pursuit to doom Mr. Smith, or in this case Pitt 'Meat is Murder' (Smiths' first album title). The always vociferous Vince Vaughn co-stars as Mr. Smith's sidekick or in other words 'Bigmouth Strikes Again' (Smiths' song). Director Doug Liman does an admirable job with the verbose and chemistry of our main Smith protagonists. However, Liman did push it to the depthless formulaic level with the action of the film. Pitt and Jolie obviously light up the screen with their beautification physical characteristics. There was no 'Jennycide' in this film! Sorry Jennifer!

I will not spoil the ending for you, but I will say that 'There is a Light That Never Goes Out' (Smiths' song) between Mr. & Mrs. Smith. **** Good",8,0,3,15 July 2005
The Departed," Acotrs play 'de' 'part' successfully in 'The Departed'
","There is no doubt that Martin Scorsese's instant classic mobster flick 'The Departed' has not been left for dead. Not only has it received lauded critical success, but it also has been a box office monster. OK, I am going to rat and tell you what the film is all about. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as Billy Costigan, a novice cop who goes undercover and poses as a henchman to Boston Mafia Guru Frank Costello played by an unknown actor named Jack Nicholson. Kidding! I was just Jacking you off! Eventually, these 'Costo' brothers' pseudo-relation will cost them a great deal and not much is saved. Dicaprio continues to demonstrate that he is a true aviator in the world of acting and that his pretty face is not always in the clouds. He was impressive as Costigan, his character is likable and made you want to advise him 'Billy, Don't Be A Hero' so his life will not be endangered. What can you say about Jack? Nicholson's Costello routine was wicked, wily, and wonderful. Ummmmm I smell a rat! That would have to be Matt Damon who was astounding as police rat Colin Sullivan. Damon was a little damon in this part , but the talented Mr. Damon has effectively played wicked before. I also dirkly digged Mark Wahlberg's performance as the callous Sgt. Dignam. I guess you can't take the dig out of Wahlberg's movie characters. All the aforementioned are worthy of Oscar noms. Acting vets Alec Baldwin, Martin Sheen, and Ray Winstone also gave 'The Departed' a will to incorporate an outstanding acting ensemble. The only character which I thought was lifeless in 'The Departed' was Madolyn (played by Vera Farmiga), the lone principal female character of the film bared no momentous contribution. Before I depart, I must mention that the iconic Marty Scorsese makes a triumphant return to the genre which made him a film director legend. Hopefully for his sake, he will not also be classified as a Susan Lucci legend by losing out on another Best Director Oscar. His nom is in the bag already. OK, I am departing now but don't you depart from ratting on to 'The Departed'. ***** Excellent",10,0,0,14 November 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," 'Zero Dark Thirty' is no zero of a movie!
","I am about to embark on the biggest punhunt in the history of my corny pun-induced movie reviews. And I am also on a mission to hunt down men and women to witness the mastery of 'Zero Dark Thirty'. OK, I am sorry to scare you away, and I am also sorry that I bombed with that opening of my movie review of the spectacular 'Zero Dark Thirty'. Director Kathryn Bigelow's movie about the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden is about as gripping as it gets in watching a motion picture. 'Zero Dark Thirty' stars Jessica Chastain as Maya, a CIA Agent who had an integral role in finding the Pakistani three-story home where Osama Bin Laden hid and where he was eventually killed by the U.S. Navy Seal Team Six. The Maya character is based on a real female CIA Agent who was the secret-operative defining force in finding Bin Laden. The movie opens with no images but of audio recordings of 911 calls from people in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001; the day that changed our world forever. And then it jumps two years later at an undisclosed Detainee Prison where supposedly CIA Agents used torture techniques as waterboarding to Islamic terrorist detainees to force them to divulge information. The information from the detainees was the watershed or should I say waterboard moment that spurred up the eventual finding of Osama Bin Laden years later; but obviously this did not happen abruptly. It was a rigorous and challenging process that is captured authentically by the great directorial hand of Oscar-winning Director Kathryn Bigelow. Remind me again why she was not nominated for a Best Director Oscar for her exemplary orchestration of 'Zero Dark Thirty'. Talk about terror! The Academy sure slipped big time with that omission. The last 30 minutes of 'Zero Dark Thirty' in depicting the Navy Seals raid and the killing of Bin Laden was a thing of cinematic beauty. Mark Boal's compelling screenplay of 'Zero Dark Thirty' was a bowl of sharp and cerebral dialogue that accentuated the heroism of Maya. Chastain's performance is the best I have seen by any actor or actress in 2012. In fact, it is one of the best (if not the best) I have seen by any leading actress in motion picture history. Chastain brilliantly captures a woman's determination to accomplish a challenging mission. The supporting cast of 'Zero Dark Thirty' earned their medals of thespian excellence like Chastain. Jason Clarke's performance as CIA Agent Dan, who ran the Detainee Camp, is not torturous to watch at all and it should have merited a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Kyle Chandler shined under the 'Zero Dark Thirty' lights as Joseph Bradley, who led the CIA Delegation in Pakistan. Jennifer Ehle was a revelation as CIA Agent Jessica who also befriends Maya. Mark Strong's brawny performance as CIA Administrator George added to his strong thespian resume. And James Gandolfini was a hit as the CIA Director. Now I am going to hunt down a few more deserving accolades for 'Zero Dark Thirty' in the technical department; those would be Greig Frasier's stunning cinematography, William Goldenberg & Dylan Tichenor's perfect editing, and Jeremy Hindle's astonishing art direction. I also have to score one more, that would be Alexander Desplat's mesmeric score. 'Zero Dark Thirty' is the best movie of the year, and please don't raid in my parade by disagreeing with me. See for yourself! ***** Excellent",10,16,35,13 January 2013
Steve Jobs," Pretty good job!
","I am about to launch my review of the biopic film 'Steve Jobs' on the revolutionary computer mogul. But the pun pressure is on, I don't know if I will be able to have a Pun Mac attack with my review of Director Danny Boyle's inventive but at times unauthentic movie. Don't get me wrong, the film is not filled with rotten apples of filmmaking. Boyle takes an unusual approach in setting the film in three different time eras of Jobs about to launch his latest product designs: the Mac, NEXT, and the IMac; obviously, the latter did not do too shabby. I credit Boyle for this distinct approach, but I doubt how much authenticity was involved in what transpired in those launches. In the three launches, Jobs interacts with longtime marketing director/right-hand woman Joanna Hoffman, longtime upstart partner Steve Wozniak, Apple CEO/Surrogate Father Figure John Sculley and others; all while dealing with a paternal responsibility with at first he denied. Michael Fassbender fascinates once again; this time with his fervent & magnificent performance as Jobs. Seth Rogen has never been better with his dramatic programmed work as Wozniak, Jeff Daniels was his most-of-the-time usual steady self as Sculley, and Kate Winslet was impressive as Hoffman. Acclaimed screenwriter Aaron Sorkin did provide some words of entrepreneur & arrogance wisdom (sort of computer speak) with his 'Steve Jobs' script; but as he did with Zuckerberg, he did not articulate a pretty picture of Jobs by focusing a bit more on his arrogance. Sure it was unorthodox, but 'Steve Jobs' did the job for the most part and computes as a worthy film in my book. **** Good",8,0,1,15 January 2016
Crazy Heart," Jeff Bridges is not falling down! The Dude country rocks!
","'Crazy Heart' is all about building Bridges (as in Jeff) to his long awaited well-deserved Best Actor Oscar? Well, maybe but that is not all of it. Jeff Bridges' exemplary starring performance as former country star legend Bad Blake was not (to say the least) half bad. In fact it was one of the best orchestrated by an actor in this country this year. The 'Crazy Heart' narrative tic-tock focuses on Blake's struggles to make a country living; in not being the country crooner he used to be. He is not known by the present country fan generation, and quasi-followed by longtime country fans. Moreover, the bad about Bad is that he now plays in rinky-dink bars across the country instead of sold-out stadiums as he did during his heyday. Blake also plays that bottle like there is no tomorrow, he is bad to the liver bone; but somehow is able to perform satisfactorily at his small-time gigs. Blake lives day-by-day in the hierarchy of survival, even though on the back of his mind he knows that his hardcore alcohol & nicotine habits will end his country life in the near future. Bad does take in some good southern comfort in a beautiful & wholesome music reporter named Jean Craddock who wants it real bad from Bad. OK, that was bad! I meant to say was that Jean falls for Bad. Blake, who has been divorced four times, takes a liking to his 'I Dream of Jeanie' country gal; even though she is twenty years younger than him. First time Writer-Director Scott Cooper does a nice job in his vision & scribe of this small tale about an aging country star in the melancholy twilight of his career; sporadically it reminded me of Darren Aronofsky's wondrous small film 'The Wrestler'. My only sour note to Cooper is that the whole age-gap romance between Bad & Jean somehow did not seem authentic, and at times a bit country creepy. 'Crazy Heart' also had thespian heart from its supporting players: Maggie Gyllenhaal was commendable as Jean (but not exactly Oscar-worthy), Colin Farrell marveled as country star & Blake disciple Tommy Sweet, and Robert Duvall was once again scene-stealing as bar owner & Bad pal Wayne. T-Bone Burnett's music of 'Crazy Heart' was a t-bone well done! But now to helming more Bridges, Bridges, Bridges. Not only was his starring performance off the country charts, but Jeff also croons many of the tunes of the film. So have a heart, and see this infamous actor dude named Jeff Bridges do his badass acting thang in 'Crazy Heart'. **** Good",9,0,1,3 February 2010
Love Actually," Actually One of the Best of the Year
","Love Actually' actually has the credentials to be judged as the supreme romantic comedy of the year. The film follows an ensemble of lovestruck characters in a five-week period before the Christmas holidays. It combines the ingenious character-filled interrelated subplots of 'Magnolia' with the exhilarating joyous connotations of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral'. Moreover, the irony of the situation is that too much love actually leads to 4 weddings and in some cases can lead to an unexpected funeral in an unexplained magnolia occurrence. Screenwriter Richard Curtis' freshman directorial effort deserves a Curtis curtain call. Ok! Let's go back to our cupid players. Hugh Grant grants us another superb bland performance as the crafty Prime Minister who falls for one of his assistants. Alan Rickman, the famous 'Die Hard' villain Hans Gruber, executes a towering performance as the editor who is tempted to an infidel act by his sexually obsessed secretary. Emma Thompson was also wonderful here as Rickman's endearing wife. Colin Firth, of 'Bridget Jones' Diary' fame, was 'write' on as a secluded writer who falls for his Portuguese aide. Liam Neeson's performance as a widowed stepfather who strongly bonds with his 10 year old stepson is in my 'Meezer's List' as one of the best supporting performances of the year. However, I am not saying 'nighty nighty' yet to the superb acting of 'Love Actually' because I must commend Bill Nighy's work as an aging musician who executes the scene-stealing performances of the film. 'Love Actually' is a cinematic classic film act to act. You actually have to see this one! ***** Excellent",10,0,1,9 December 2003
12 Years a Slave," Northup's Odyssey captured here!
","'12 Years A Slave' is a powerful picture on the challenging struggle of real-life free-slave Solomon Northup, who was kidnapped and put back to the horrors of slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor's name will be pronounced numerous times during movie awards season for his riveting starring performance as Northrup. In fact, the whole movie was freed from lousy acting with other impressive performances; most notably from Michael Fassbender as the villainous slaveowner Edwin Epps, Sarah Paulson as his horror story-esque sister Mistress Epps, and Lupita Nyong'O as the tortured slave Patsey. Director Steve McQueen's work here will propel him to elite auteur status. But believe it or not, John Ridley's screenplay was a bit too detached for my taste. Nevertheless, break the chains and witness for yourself the gripping '12 Years A Slave'. **** Excellent",9,4,6,29 November 2013
Wedding Crashers," Wedding Comedic Bliss!
","'Wedding Crashers' has engaged many movie lovers throughout the nation. It's a box office hit that ceremoniously has made a comedic impact in a very 'marry marry' way. Vince Vaughn & Owen Wilson star as Jeremy Klein & John Beckwith, two hardcore wedding crashers who strategically plan out their pseudo-guest conquests with artistry and appeal. What are the rewards? Complementary culinary arts tasting, complementary liquor arts tasting, and complimentary vagina arts tasting! I am going to kill my high school career counselor! Why didn't he invite wedding crashologists to the school's annual career day event? Anyway, Jeremy & John eventually do fall in love and not in lust with female wedding guests. John succumbs to Claire Cleary, the candy-coated politician daughter played by the uprising starlet Rachel Mcadams. Jeremy falls for Claire's sister Gloria; her magnetically robust demeanor was quite memorable. Isla Fisher's jocular performance as Gloria makes her the 'scene-stealing maid of comedic honor' of 'Wedding Crashers'. Our 'Wedding Crasher' stars were also not too shabby. Vince Vaughn's prototype garrulous, but never exhausting, acting was quite stupendous. You also got to owe it to Owen for his perspicacious solid work. This dynamic comedic acting duo should not be annulled. They have the chemistry potentiality to be the 'Martin & Lewis' of our generation. The rest of the cast of 'Wedding Crashers' was also worth inviting. Christopher Walken once again was 'walkin' to the part of a controlling, but yet, caring father with exact precision. Jane Seymour was 'm.i.l.f.ing' it through as the hot mother who craves for John. We also get to 'see more' of Seymour in 'Wedding Crashers'. That in itself is worth crashing this movie! Also, there is a high profile comedic actor who makes an appearance during the final segments of the film. I 'Will' not say too much, but let me just state that he proves once more that he has the 'Will to Power' in comedies. I do 'vow' my head to Director David Dobkin for elucidating our humdrum summer movie season with 'Wedding Crashers'. Make sure your next movie 'reception' is 'Wedding Crashers'. ***** Excellent",9,3,6,27 July 2005
There Will Be Blood," There Will Be Cinematic Supremacy!
","There will be numerous mastery achievements for you when you view the P.T. Anderson masterpiece 'There Will Be Blood'. Let's take a look:There will be an exceptional screenplay- Master Anderson struck oil when he loosely adapted Upton Sinclair's novel 'Oil' into 'There Will Be Blood'. Anderson extended Sinclair's fable into a deeper obsession piece. Anderson's scribe focuses on Daniel Plainview, a coalman turned oilman in the early 1900's who is obsessively determined to drill oil lands and richly succeed at whatever humane price. Plainview travels with his child named H.W. who he also considers his business partner. Plainview encounters a proposition to drill for oil in the hill lands occupied by the Sunday family. Plainview's nemesis in the film comes in the form of Eli Sunday, the preacher Sunday son who is suspicious of Plainview's antics. The questions are: How intense does this rivalry lurks itself into? Is there going to be a 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' in 'There Will Be Blood'? I will not spoil it for you or else there will be blood from the author of this review by its readers. Speaking of authoring, Anderson's script is articulately creative and intuitive. I am confident there will be a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination for P.T.'s libretto effort of 'There Will Be Blood'. There will be breathtaking cinematography and art direction- The picturesque cinematography and exquisite art direction of 'There Will Be Blood' efficiently signifies in epic proportions the oil lands of America as being tranquil fertile grounds of potential richness and self-indulgence. Kudos goes out to Blood's 'witty' cinematographer Robert Elswitt and 'uncranky' art director David Crank for their supreme visions. There will be Oscar nominations for these two in their respected categories and hopefully also wins. There will be auditory brilliance in the film's music- Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood is definitely not no airhead. His powerful score of 'There Will Be Blood' profoundly guides the film and is an integral part of the storytelling process. There will be an Oscar win for Greenwood for Best Score. Are you keeping score? There will be precise film editing- Long-time Anderson collaborator Dylan Tichenor's design and cuts of Blood was bloody perfecto. I will have a tick if Tichenor is not nominated for a Best Editing Oscar nom. However, I am confident that there will be one for Dylan. There will be cr√®me-a-la-crop acting ensemble thespian efforts- Let's lead with the lead= Mr. Daniel Day-Lewis! His performance as Daniel Plainview was not of plain material. It ranks as one of the best of all time. The power, greed, ego, charisma, and darkness he invokes in the character were of tour-de-force quality. There will be another Best Actor Oscar boy in Mr. Day-Lewis residence! Day-Lewis also won a bald golden boy back in 1996 for his touching performance in 'My Left Foot'. But I will give my left foot or my right one for that matter and guarantee that Daniel will be prized with another Best Actor Oscar for his startling performance in 'There Will Be Blood'. Paul Dano, who played the angst mute teenage son in 'Little Miss Sunshine', performance as young preacher Eli Sunday spoke volumes. I did 'dunno' know that Dano had it in him. Paulie, want an Oscar? Hopefully, there will be a Best Supporting Actor nomination for him. Other worthy bloody acting players included Kevin J. O' Connor as Daniel Plainview's 'brother from another mother' Henry, Ciaran Hinds as Plainview's right hand man Fletcher Hamilton, and of course Dillon Freasier as Mini-Plainview or in other words Daniel's son H.W. Plainview. There will be prototypical idiosyncratic Paul Thomas Anderson direction- And there is nothing wrong with that! P.T. Anderson is one of the mastermind directors of our generation and he incorporates his typical P.T. directorial themes also in 'There Will Be Blood'. He cerebrally integrates such themes which have been typical of P.T. Anderson films as obsession, egocentricity, dysfunction, greed, love, and plight for freedom in 'There Will Be Blood' just as he has in his past masterpieces 'Magnolia', 'Boogie Nights', 'Punch Drunk Love', and 'Hard Eight'. P.T.'s direction of blood was its centrifugal force of separating the aforementioned themes in the film's various narrative elements. P.T. definitely does not give it p.t. (part-time) to his devotion in directing films. He is the best in the business! There will be a well-deserved Best Director Oscar for the man! There will be a Best Picture Oscar for 'There Will Be Blood'- Hopefully, that will occur! But obviously there is stiff competition from other selected worthy films that were released in 2007. But there will be prayers that 'There Will Be Blood' slices up to being selected as the best of the clan! ***** Excellent",10,1,5,17 January 2008
Burlesque," Boo for Burlesque!
","The musical 'Borelesque' I mean 'Burlesque' was grotesque with its formulaic tune. 'Burlesque' stars Cher as Tess, an L.A. burlesque-club owner who must come with a big show of cash in order to save her struggling club. However, the movie is really the showcase of Christina Aguilera who also stars as Ali, an aspiring singer-dancer who heads to L.A. from Iowa to make it big, what an innovative concept for a movie! Sorry, I used to work at Sarcasmesque. Anyways, Ali slips into Tess' club, and well you could figure out the rest¬Ö. female protagonist stars with lousy job, her co-workers think she is a nobody, she meets a male friend, she gets a chance to show her talent, she makes it big, she falls for male friend, she has a jealous rival out to ruin her, she has conflict with lover, she has a conflict with her superior, problems eventually get solved and the rest is¬Ö. well, you get the picture. Or maybe you should not get this picture. Writer-Director Steve Antin's directorial and screenplay 'Burlesque' antics were making me hope that the show must not go on. I was not moonstruck with Cher's over-the-top performance as Tess; if I can turn back time, I would have fast forwarded all her scenes. Aguilera was not too shabby in her debut acting performance as Ali, but I was more impressed with the voice than the act. Stanley Tucci's performance as the club's gay fashion designer in 'Burlesque' was dressed with the same characterization as his duplicate character in 'The Devil Wears Prada'. What's next 'Tucci Wears Gucci'; sorry Stan, I know you are a hell of an actor. Eric Dane seemed bored in his portrayal of Marcus, the wealthy magnate who is trying to buy Tess' club. Kristen Bell's work as the villainous dancer Nikki also danced itself with too many over-the-top moves. Cam Gigandet's performance as Ali's love interest Jack (who is also one of the club's bartenders) was a bit charismatic but not gigantic enough. The music of 'Burlesque' was at zero level in my goose-bump meter. So I guess it does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that 'Burlesque' to me was a near complete mess. ** Needs Improvement",4,0,2,6 February 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," Pretty good movie, AAAAA I am dead! Pretty good movie, AAAAA I am dead! Pretty good movie, AAAAA I am dead! ......
","Director Doug Liman's 'Edge of Tomorrow' is 'Groundhog Day' on steroids with some mean looking aliens. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Lt. Colonel Cage, who is sent into battle against mimic aliens who have destroyed much of the world. Cage is not really programmed for battle, probably because he was caged too much in military offices instead of the battlefield. Cage is scared out of wits, but then something miraculous happens; he dies in battle, and then relives the same day repeatedly. Why that happens? Let me not spoil if for you, but let's say that he became a blood brother of the Omega alien mimic fraternity; they have that? The stunning Emily Blunt co-stars as Rita, a fierce warrior who was pivotal in destroying many of these mimic aliens in a past war. Cage groundhogs into Rita's world and the two team to destroy the Omega mimic plan to destroy mankind. The first two acts of 'Edge of Tomorrow' kept me on the edge of my seat with its inventiveness in a futuristic action movie. However, the third act of 'mimic aliens vs. human soldiers' action unfortunately mimicked many other formulaic battle-oriented action flicks. I did like Cruise and Blunt in their performances; and to be blunt with you it was refreshing to see Cruise as a coward character and not cruising with the same old 'machoman saving the world' typecast character he has played many times before, while Blunt cruised with another bravado performance. So let me finish this review before it ends on the edge of tomorrow. But if you got nothing going on tomorrow, it's not a bad idea to live & relive the 'Edge of Tomorrow'. **** Good",7,2,4,7 March 2015
Whiplash," A masterpiece!!!
","Now whip it! Into shape, shape it up, looks great! Whip it real good!!! I just had the Devo inside in that intro for my movie review of the fabulous movie 'Whiplash'. What a gem!! 'Whiplash' stars Miles Teller as first year music student Andrew Neiman. Andrew is a student drummer who is more than just a little drummer boy in his pursuit to excel at his beat craft. However, he has to prove his skills to the extremely rigid music school instructor/conductor Terrence Fletcher. Let's just say that Fletcher is trying to make a newman out of Neiman. As Andrew tries to excel in the battery, Fletcher's own authoritarian battery charge is always on full in pushing Andrew to the edge. Damien Chazzelle orchestrates 'Whiplash' with a magnetic flow that hits all the right beats in his direction of the picture; and his screenplay also hit all the write verbal notes. Miles Teller delivers yet another stellar performance in his rising career; here as Neiman. J.K. Simmons was terrible as Fletcher! Wait, wait! I was J.K. (just kidding!) Simmons' work as Fletcher might just be the best delivered by any actor or actress this year. Paul Reiser also delivered an impressive supporting performance as Andrew's supporting dad; but I was not as mad about his performance as I was in Simmons' classic masterpiece thespian conduction. So here is my final drum roll of this picture.......... 'Whiplash' is one of the best movies of 2014! ***** Excellent",10,0,2,19 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Crash into this one now!!!! Rich with entertainment!
","Howl can you not like this Wolf!!! Anyways, many critics are enamored with Martin Scorsese's stockbroker saga 'The Wolf of Wall Street' while many others have called it a despicable, slimy ruthless flick. I am with the former. Undoubtedly, this is the most entertaining movie of 2013, even with its outlandishness and all. The narrative is based on the real life exploits of stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who rose to riches in the stock trade but not without a few corruption trips to the market, if you get my thrift. Belfort was also an avid drug addict, with his preferred drug of choice being the quaalude; yep, Jordan was definitely a boy in the lude. Oh! Jordan was also profoundly hooked on hookers; so he got plenty of action 'under the Belfort'. Leonardo DiCaprio's magnetic performance as Belfort is Oscar-worthy and it's a shame Leo's stock has not risen enough to be a frontrunner for the Best Actor Oscar chase this year. DiCaprio knocks it out of the ballpark! Jonah Hill was outstanding also as Belfort's right hand man of corruption Donnie Azoff. Hill should also be in the moneyball I mean money for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Other stock worthy supporting performances rose from Kyle Chandler as an FBI Agent chasing Belfort's wrongdoings, Rob Reiner as Belfort's sympathetic father, and Matthew McConaughey with yet another scene-stealing performance as a Belfort mentor. Margot Robbie was not extravagant as Belfort's second wife Naomi, but Robbie did not rob me of any eye candy viewing. Terence Winter's screenplay was sure a wonderland of outrageous entertainment. And what can you say about the legendary Scorsese. He has delivered again in vintage Marty form. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' reminded me of Scorsese's 'GoodFellas' with a stockbroker corruption landscape. So thump your chest and get psyched up to 180 minutes of pure, zany entertainment with 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. ***** Excellent",10,1,14,6 January 2014
The Last King of Scotland," You ugana love Mr. Whitaker in this one!
","'Forest' heaven's sake, somebody please give Mr. Forest Whitaker the Best Actor Academy Award for his ferocious tour-de-force leading performance as Ugandan dictator Idi Amin! His work will reign as the king of performances of male actors this year. However, I do have to dictate that he was not the leading actor in the film. That reign of being the premier protagonist of 'The Last King of Scotland' would go to James Mcavoy, who plays Nicholas Garrigan, the young Scottish doctor who moves to Uganda and befriends Amin. It is prominently his story that is the film's showcase. Garrigan, not only becomes Amin's doctor, but as Amin calls him also 'his most trusted adviser'. That is till Garrigan discovers the massacre Amin havocs on his people. It also did not help matters much when Dr. Garrigan made too many Ugandan house calls to Amin's wife Kay, so they can play doctor together if you know what I 'amin'. Anyway, Idi Boy was responsible for the savage brutal deaths of over 300,000 people during his reign in the 70's. He was a vindictive eradicator! The film was inspired by true events, even though the Garrison character is fictional. James Mcavoy's underrated performance as Dr. Garrigan deserves a doctorate in effectual acting. Kerry Washington's work as Kay was also 'ok' in my book. Director Kevin MacDonald can be called the 'Mac Director Daddy' for assembling a gripping film on the personal corollary of dictatorship through one man's eyes. I also have to helm other cinematic players in 'the King's court': Jeremy Brock's screenplay, Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography, Joshua Barraud's art direction, and Alex Heffe's musical score. However, it is that 'Forest' through the trees that primarily branches the cinematic power of 'The Last King of Scotland'. **** Good",8,1,2,27 January 2007
American Gangster," The Crowe and The Washington rule in this great Scott American Classic!
","Frank Lucas was a real true to form American Gangster. Detective Robbie Roberts was a real true to form American Cop-Master. The true story of the grueling process on the evolution, execution, and resolution on how Roberts pinned Lucas is revealed in the masterful Director Ridley Scott film 'American Gangster'. Denzel Washington stars as Lucas, a 1970's black American Kingpin who builds a drug empire by smuggling heroin in coffins of dead soldiers from the Far East. Russell Crowe also stars as Roberts, the righteous lawful detective who heads up an undercover-angel law enforcement team whose master plan is to be 'frank', nail Frank! The great Scott masterfully orchestrates the film as a two-sided good cop/bad gangster symphony; you got Lucas up-rise to gangster notoriety as one story and Mister Roberts passionate determinative quest to nail the American Gangster in the other. Crowe and Washington do not even share screen time together until the film's final chapter. Though this is ultimately a cerebral tale of a cat-and-mouse chase of a law-biding cop's mission to nail down an egoistic hoodlum, the film's major theme that is investigated is police corruption. Crowe and Washington were, not surprisingly, brilliant as Lucas and Roberts. The supporting acting gang of 'American Gangster' also did show their true good enforcement acting colors: Josh Brolin was wickedly conniving as crooked Detective Trupo, Chiwetel Ejiofor was a hoot as Frank's brother Huey Lucas, Ruby Dee was divine as Mama Lucas, and Cuba Gooding Jr. still showed us the acting as Kingpin competitor Nicky Barnes. Screenplay extraordinaire Steven Zaillian penned a gangbuster striking scribe for 'American Gangster'. But my Great Scott, in the end, American Gangster's main hero was Director Ridley 'Believe it or Not'! Don't be afraid of the 'American Gangster', seize it today! ***** Excellent",Null,1,2,11 October 2008
The Green Mile," Frankie 'Darabont' Goes To Hollywood Succesffully Again!
","Director Frank Darabont's first picture 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one the best prison films of all time.  So what do you do for an encore, Mr. Darabont? Well, this isn't a hard sale or should I say cell. You would just make another prison film! And while you are it Frank, Why don't you cast the biggest male star in Hollywood as your lead actor? Remember to give it a catchy title like 'The Green Mile' and not something that sounds like  the tongue-twisting challenge of 'The Shawshank Redemption.' Frank, also do not get imprisoned in coming up with the story. Just call your friend Stephen King, invite him for lunch, and borrow some of his prison stories. If you use some of my ideas Frank, I am sure your 2nd prison film which we would call 'The Green Mile' will make more green at the box-office than what you beloved Shawshank totaled up. Wow! Frank! I am glad you took my advice. I just saw your 'Green Mile' and I thought it was very good. I see that you adapted it from Stephen King's story about a death row giant and his supernatural powers. I see that you once again created a bond between the black and white man in prison by having the prison guard befriend this gentle giant. I am also glad that you hired Tom Hanks to be the lead actor in the film as the prison guard. Told you he was good! However, Frank I did not expect to see very fine supporting performances from fairly unknowned actors such as Michael Clarke Duncan and Doug Hutchinson. Way to go Frank! Looks like you don't always need all my help! Also, it looks like 'The Green Mile' did pretty good in the box office.  However, Frank the only thing that shocks me about this film is its length. 3 hours and 10 minutes for a film is like a life sentence in cinematic terms! But all in all Frank, I am very proud of your 'Green Mile.' Frank- Even though you are now enjoying all the greatness of your film, I hope you don't relax too much and hoping that this Frankie Goes to Hollywood again. **** good",8,0,0,21 March 2000
The Reader," Reader Wanted!
","Congratulations! You are the protagonist of this film review! Yes, you are. It is not me the writer, it is you 'the reader'. Come back! Please do not stop reading! Director Stephen Daldry's 'The Reader' is definitely not the feel good movie of the year, but it is gripping enough to satisfy your visual-literary movie experience. Kate Winslet stars or is a supporting star (depending on which movie awards you go by) as Hannah Schmitz, a German lonely woman in the 40's who works as a transportation ticket-taker. Her young meal ticket though comes in the form of Michael Berg, a secluded teenager she meets in a side street in caring for him cause of an ailment. Eventually, Hanna's pedophile storm stars erupting when she starts having passionate sex with him on a routine basis. You don't have too read much into the fact that Michael does not mind that whatsoever. Hanna does fixate for Michael to read her novels and books; call it a foreplay literary fetish, but if it helps getting Kate Winslet into bed with you then it's a well read out plan. OK, enough! Hannah's temporary cradlerock adventure does fade when she deserts her apartment and also Michael for an employment promotion. Michael eventually reconnects with Hannah (and no, not on Facebook) years later as a law student when he witnesses a Holocaust S.S. trial which Hannah is one of the defendants. 'The Reader' also shows a much older Michael in recent past time reminiscing on his 'Hannah-Barbaro' experience, and in trying to open up resolving chapters in order to help the troubled older Hannah. Speaking of chapters, I will let you (the reader) visually read the remaining plot line chapters of 'The Reader' in order for yours truly not to play the part of the antagonist 'Reader Spoiler'. Winslet's performance is worthy of all the accolades it has received. David Kross and Ralph Fiennes also delivered authentic performances as the young & older Michaels respectively. Writer-Director Stephen Daldry did demonstrate the post Holocaust doldrums in 'The Reader', but his readiness on the narrative was primarily fixated on the impact that hiding a disability can have on people's lives. 'The Reader' does include some inconsequential scenes that could have been read out of the film, but it is still a powerful film which you should read into. **** Good",8,2,3,26 January 2009

Maybe Toni was dedicating the song to 80's acting icon Mickey Rourke. The Mick powerfully acted in such 80's cult classics as: 'Body Heat', 'Diner', 'Rumble Fish', '9 ¬Ω Weeks', and 'Barfly'. Rourke roared on screen with magnetism, coolness, and self-assurance in the 80's. Mickey did not have many obstacles to wrestle back then except: women, fame, and money; and those are matches made in Hollywood heaven. Then the 90's rolled around and Roarke hit rock bottom! And there the internal wrestling with personal traumas, egoistic insubordination, and lost opportunities took a toll on Rourke physically and emotionally. Well, the good news is that the vigorous thespian roar of Rourke is back in a winning way with his superb performance as wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson in 'The Wrestler'. Rourke has been gradually climbing the comeback ladder in recent years with impressive supporting roles in 'The Pledge', 'Sin City', and 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico'. However, those were just opening acting matches for the main event of Rourke's comeback in the form of 'The Wrestler'. Director Darren Aronofsky's heartbreaking but aspiring film rams it in as one of the best of the year. I was in awe in how Robinson's character is analogous to the man Mickey Rourke himself. But the commending aspect is how Rourke can somehow differentiate & assimilate between the two with his poignant performance. The fictional character Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was a famous 80's wrestler with a cult following who somehow lost his ways in the 90's and thereafter. The present Robinson is lonely, contrived, and melancholy; he still has a passion to wrestle, but he is not wrestling in the same packed arenas he used to headline at his peak. Now he wrestles for little money at small wrestling shows at VFW halls. Randy is also a part-time grocery employee in order to make ends meat. He visits a city strip club on occasion mainly to see Cassidy, a middle-aged stripper with a heart of gold. Randy and Cassidy are not exactly lovebirds but it's the closest thing to a romance in 'The Wrestler'. Marisa Tomei's work as Cassidy continues to demonstrate that her raw acting proficiency continues at a consistency level. Note to Academy: Please give the Mona Marisa a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Randy also tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter Stephanie, who despises him due to childhood abandonment. Their heartfelt emotional roller-coaster scenes are of the supreme handkerchief material. The underrated Evan Rachel Wood was potent as Stephanie, and hope her performance in 'The Wrester' is a call to Hollywoodland to give her more credibility as one of today's best young actresses. Another nice slamming touch to 'The Wrestler' is how Aronofsky truly depicts on how wrestlers support each other and are affable to one another outside the ring. Robert Siegel's screenplay of 'The Wrestler' will be hard to defeat as the championing one of 2008. It was that strong, genuine, and reflective! The film's cinematography, editing, and art direction are also bona fide contenders to deservingly receive Oscar noms. And what can I say about Mr. Aronofsky, you get straight A's Mr. A for your tour-de-force direction of 'The Wrestler'; hope an Oscar ring comes your way Mr. A! Even though 'The Wrestler' had a tag-team cast and crew to make it a winning film, the ultimate ringleader of the movie was Mickey Rourke with his astonishing performance which should present him with a Best Actor Oscar and a legitimate resurrection back to the film industry! Keep blowing our mind Mickey! Its guys like you Mickey that inspire us to reach for the top no matter how many slams life gives us! ***** Excellent",10,2,3,19 January 2009
Hancock," Modest but not Super!
","We have seen many fake Hancocks throughout our lifetime. That would come in the form of drunken, cocky male humanoids who think they have special superheroistic powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way. Those guys are really just a bunch of cocks. The 'Hancock' protagonist in Director Peter Berg's feature in reality is also drunk and cocky, but in reality also possesses special powers to conquer any other male or female humanoid that gets in their way to harm the city of Los Angeles. However, the L.A. citizens do not partake in the appreciation process mostly because Hancock is a drunk and cocky (for lack of a better word or maybe it's the perfect word¬Ö.) Cock! Blockbuster king Will Smith plays Hancock with no real superhero thespian powers but modest enough to give it a heroic effort. Jason Bateman plays Ray Embrey, the public relations guru who desperately helps Hancock in getting the citizens to dispel Hancock's cocky image by changing his superhero persona as more as a crime-fighter than a bottle-chaser. The luscious Charlize Theron portrays Ray's devoted wife Mary, who in turn Mary Mary quite contrary turns out to be a little scary. But I will leave it at that. Do not want to be a cocky spoiler! Berg's direction in the first half of 'Hancock' is an entertaining crowd-pleaser by displaying Hancock's comedic rebellious ways, but Berg throws us a curve ball in the latter part of the film that struck out with many viewers & critics, present company included. I am slightly recommending a 'Hancock' because it does bring plenty of comedic saviors in its first hour to satisfy your cinematic cravings. *** Average",7,1,2,27 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Dark Heaven!
","'Star Wars Episode 3- Revenge of the Rich' is based on how movie stars are striking back against the paparazzi. The film stars Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee, and Cameron Diaz. However, that is not the 'Star Wars' episode I am going to review. Of course, the episode I am going to review is the final chapter of what is the most successful franchise in movie history- 'Star Wars: Episode 3- Revenge of the Sith'. Director George Lucas has saved the best for last! We finally learn the power of the Dark Side, which in now way is reminiscent of Halle Berry's steamy sex scene in 'Monster's Ball'. Speaking of monsters, viewers finally get the answer of the most asked question in film history- 'What makes Anakin Skywalker transmute to the Dark Side and become Darth Vader?' I was a bit displeased with Episodes 1 & 2: 'The Phantom Menace' & 'Attack of the Clones', but my George I think you got it right with 'Revenge of the Sith'. It's a blockbuster movie extravaganza embodied with exceptional special effects, striking action scenes, and memorable characters. I have a 'Sith Sense' that you will see some dead people in this episode, but I will not reveal whom. Ewan Mcgregor, Natalie Portman, Hayden Christensen, and Samuel L. Jackson are more stirring here than in their trifling performances in the first 2 episodes; at least this time they do not appear to be so spaced out. However, the palpable supreme performance of Sith is Ian Mcdiarmid's brutal work as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine. The delightful androids of 'Star Wars' (C3PO, R2D2,Yoda, and even Chewbacca) are also a continued bliss. It was even cool to see a Jar Jar Binks (who's real name is Mesa) appear. Do not panic! He only appears for a few seconds! I realize that too much 'Mesa' can be annoying. Let me also point out that the biggest badass 'Greengo' of 'Star Wars' continues to be the little green Yoda. He rocked! However, 'Star Wars' is still primarily Anakin Skywalker's tale. One of the greatest movie moments in history is when the Darth Vader armor is inserted on Anakin!!!!!! 'Star Wars- Episode 3: Revenge of Sith' is interstellar cinematic heaven! ***** Excellent",9,3,7,15 June 2005
Ray," It's Rayning Oscar for Foxx
","Let's see here! There is buzz that Jamie Foxx will receive numerous acting accolades for his performance as Ray Charles in the bio film 'Ray'. I guess he is going to have to 'unchain' himself and be present to receive his well-deserved statuettes. His turn as Ray was wondrous. If you have not observed Foxx's multi-talented efforts, you must 'Meet This Foxxer'. Director Taylor Hackford's film was passionate, jolting, and hypnotic. It will not blind you on how a man can overcome physical challenges, mental obsessions, and diversified pressures; yet still succeed at his craft. If you see 'Ray' you will see what I mean. Kerry Washington 'kerries' the film quite nicely as Charles' wife, Bea. You will not 'bea' surprised if she receives some Supporting Actress nods during award season. Regina King continues to prove why she is the queen of the underrated African-American actresses with her stellar work as Charles' temperamental mistress, Margie. However, let's face the 'Foxx', I mean facts! It is Jamie and 'Jamie's Crying' that will make you 'Jump' out of your seats when you witness 'Ray'. So 'Hit The Road Jack' and see the light of 'Ray'. I am sure after you endure it you will have 'Georgia' I mean 'Ray' on your mind. **** Good",8,1,2,22 December 2004
Inception," Nolan is the man!!
","There are immeasurable deceptions of 'Inception' which will make your freaky-fried mind go haywire! Mind you, all done with cerebral expertise by Director Christopher Nolan. His visual euphoric masterpiece is one that requires your complete attention. And even if you don't fully digest Inception's complex plot, and most viewers will not even though they might think they have, the film is still far from being a nightmare. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Cobb, a dream extractor who specializes in stealing valuable secrets of the subconscious from others during their dream state. Call him another Cobb who has had his share of dreamy hits. OK, call that a corny-on-the-Cobb pun! There goes another one! Anyways, Cobb takes on one last job from Saito, a corporate honcho. However, this one is not to extract but to incept (hence, movie title) an idea into corporate competitor heir Robert Fisher's mind for financial gain. To incept is a more cerebral challenge than to extract, and Cobb has only attempted it once before (which becomes a centerpiece of 'Inception'), so therefore Cobb and his dream team are up for a challenging mindful task. The Cobb Dream Team consists of Arthur the dream Setup-man, Ariadne the dream Architect, Eames the dream Forger, and Yusuf the dream I guess Forger #2. Cobb does have some nightmares of his own he wants to extract due to the dreamlike existence of his deceased wife Mal in his extraction and inception jobs. That's about it on providing you information on the 'Inception' plot line. Don't want to spoil this dreamy movie for you. DiCaprio was effective as Cobb even though it was a very similar character as the one he recently played in 'Shutter Island'. The supporting cast of 'Inception' was to near perfection. Ellen Page keeps on building an already stellar career with her portrayal of Ariadne the Architect. Joseph Gordon Levitt as Arthur was steady and provided some comical contributions to a heavy-hitter movie. Tom Hardy's work as Eames the Forger was the real deal. There was not one mal thing about Marion Cotillard's deep performance as Mal. Cilian Murphy as Fisher, Ken Watanabe as Saito, and Tom Berenger as Fisher assistant Browning also provided 'Inception' some positive corporate-character thespian contributions. But most of all, 'Inception' was Christopher Nolan's vision! His direction was a cinematic magnum opus! His screenplay was an intense maze of cerebral challenges. He was the MVP of 'Inception'!!! And I hope that is the perception of the Academy and therefore finally nominate him for a Best Director Oscar. The technical Nolanders also deserve kudos! I am dreaming of Oscar nominations also for Wally Pfister's cinematography, Lee Smith's editing, and Frank Walsh & Co.'s art direction. But it is the Zimmerman himself, music score maestro Hans Zimmer, that I think has the Oscar in the bag. His pulsating score is a pivotal player throughout the entire film and I just cannot envision a better score in any other movie this year! Even though I slightly favor Nolan's 'Memento' to 'Inception', this is still worthy to be called another Nolan extraordinaire piece of work! Dream on if you think 'Inception' will not linger in your mind for days to come! ***** Excellent",9,3,10,18 July 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Sherlock Holmes deserved better support in solving the movie apaptation case!
","Depicting too many details is a classic Sherlock Holmes trait from the timeless sleuth stories of the infamous detective scribed by the late Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately, Director Guy Ritchie took that to an extreme level by ingesting his film adaptation of 'Sherlock Holmes' with TMI syndrome which caused a severe case of cluttermania to the baffled viewer. The 'Sherlock Holmes' plot focuses on a deranged Lord Blackwood who has a Gothic sinister plot to rule the world. But Holme don't play that, so it is up to Sherlock and his BFF Dr. Watson to stop the Blackwood Magic Man to cause havoc to England and the rest of the world. Seems like 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' and this worn-out plot formula continues to bring out tears & fears in me. It took a scribe team of five screenwriters to peg the 'Sherlock Holmes' movie story down. I am no Sherlock Holmes, but that was significant probable cause of the writing offense of the movie. Again, excess is not best. Another piece of evidence that hurt the film was the humdrum performance of Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler, a former Sherlock fem conquest who might or might not be betraying the Sherlock. However, not every case was cold in 'Sherlock Holmes'. Robert Downey Jr. was delightfully divine as Sherlock Holmes, and Jude Law was efficiently operable as Dr. Watson. Their character chemistry was more than elementary, it was exemplary. The film's cinematography & art direction also got passing grades for their effective 'mise en scene' to old England. Unfortunately, those positive contributions did not provide sufficient evidence to give some 'pipe dream' positive recommendation to the overrated & over-hyped 'Sherlock Holmes'. *** Average",7,1,1,30 May 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Good Pets!
","It is no secret that the animated flick 'The Secret Life of Pets' hit box office bonanza. And why not? It was a fun movie about the crazy antics that happen to pets once their owners leaves their cribs. Our main dog here is Max (voiced by Louis C.K.), who becomes very jelly when a new dog Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) joins the household. Max and Duke first duke it out for main pet ownership of the house; but then zaniness follows and they have no choice to team up and try to defend themselves against an evil anti-human stray animal clan led by a vociferous bunny named Snowball, brilliantly voiced by Kevin Hart. There are many more Pet Shop Boys in the picture that provide opportunity for laughs; including other dogs, a parrot, cats, etc. So I am not going to pet you more plot points and let you fetch this movie for yourself. Sure, there are some scenes that are over the top with slapstick outrageousness, but 'The Secret Life of Pets' still deserves a viewing feeding. **** Good",8,1,2,10 September 2016
WALL¬∑E," Woweeee for 'Wall-E'
","'Wall-E' is 'by far out' the best Pixar computer-animated film ever assembled. OK, it might sound fishy to you that I am selecting 'Wall-E' over 'Finding Nemo'. You might think I am a rat in the kitchen by selecting 'Wall-E' over 'Ratatouille'. You might think I am toying with you by selecting 'Wall-E' over 'Toy Story 1 & 2'. You might think that I am incredibly deranged by selecting 'Wall-E' over 'The Incredibles'. And you might think it is monstrous of me to select 'Wall-E' over 'Monsters, Inc'. All the aforementioned are obviously credible computer-animated Pixar creations, but none of them captured the intellectual seismic force of 'Wall-E'. This earth trash shattering robot is definitely the most appealing character graphically drawn up by the Pixars. 'Wall-E' stands for 'Waiting Amazingly Long Lines- Exasperatedly', No! It actually stands for 'Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class'. Wall-E is a small waste collecting robot who is in a solitude futuristic earth with just a tiny pet cockroach to keep him company. However, Wall-E is not a total waste because he is very ingenious in doing the garbage work in a very compacting and useful manner. Wall-E is primarily a love robot who craves for the robotic touch of a Mrs. Roboto. Before you can say 'Hello Dolly' (which is the film Wall-E constantly sees in his trashy apartment, lol) he falls for a female robotette named Eve which has traveled to earth to evaluate living organisms. Wall-E and Eve fall in love and then Wall-E eats a devilish apple which then√Ç‚Ä¶ (Wait! Wrong Eve story here). OK, here we go: Wall-E eventually follows Eve into a grandeur spaceship which takes him out of the earth-lands. In the second chapter of 'Wall-E', the film turns into an insightful environmental lesson on the futuristic fate of our universe via Wall-E's hilarious, passionate, romantic, generous, and heroic 'space cadet' spaceship adventures. Director Andrew Stanton brilliantly provides homage to Stanley Kubrick's classic '2001: A Space Odyssey' by inserting elements of the Odyssey into 'Wall-E'; i.e. Blue Danube space, a similar HAL villain, the fate of mankind, etc. Somewhere in 'Stanton Island' there is a Stanley Kubrick Memorial! There is not much dialogue in 'Wall-E', but I must verbalize that it was the way to go in the 'Wall-E' tale since it is Stanton's marvelous directorial orchestration that is the primary presentation tool of 'Wall-E'. It would be a waste if Stanton is not nominated for a Best Director Oscar nomination! 'Wall-E' is the love guru that you should really be watching this summer! 'Wall-E' will not be a waste of your time! One of the best films of 2008! I am not being off the wall when I say that 'Wall-E' is so far one of the best films of 2008! Take off and see it today! ***** Excellent",10,2,5,30 June 2008
Finding Dory," Should include it in your short term list of things to do
","Hello! My name is Meeza, and I am going to now present you my movie review of Disney Pixar's sequel to 'Finding Nemo' called 'Finding Dory'. This time around the primary fetch star is the lovable, short-term memory loss blue fish Dory. Hello! My name is Meeza, and I am going to now present you my movie review of... Wait a Second! I am ADoryble myself, as most of us are who reach our mid 40's with our short term memory. Anyways, 'Finding Dory' is very similar to the original in narrative content but does not exactly reach Nemo's depth. Dory's dilemma in 'Finding Dory' is that she suddenly is aware that she has a mother & father and goes from sea coast-to-coast to try to find them, Nemo and his neurotic dad Marlin do help Dory in her sea quest. There are new characters in this one including a wonderful octopus named Hank who Dory meets along her search for Ma & Pa. Writer-Director Andrew Stanton, who also scribed & orchestrated 'Finding Nemo', did a fine job also this time around; but the originality was not as creative as before due to similar plot line of 'Finding Nemo'. Ellen DeGeneres nailed the Dory voice once again, and the Ellen Show was one of the main reasons what baited me into liking the picture. Albert Brooks was also superb in his vocal performance as Marlin. Ed O'Neill also was quite the modern squid with his voice work as Hank. Right now there are not too many movies in the 'to see' tank from what's playing in theaters; however, 'Finding Dory' is one you should find. **** Good",7,2,10,27 June 2016
Arrival," Arrrighty Arrival!
","Here comes a puntapod arriving to your viewing eyes, as I review the sci-fi flick 'Arrival'. Please don't run away, I pun in peace. Acclaimed Director Denis Villeneuve's 'Arrival' stars the astounding Amy Adams as Dr. Louise Banks, an expert linguist professor who is called in by the U.S. Government when semi-oval saucers arrive in several locations throughout the globe, including Montana in the U.S. Her duty is to try to decipher communication from the arriving heptapods, not an easy task. They should have just called Trump to deport the illegal alien heptapods, problem solved. Anyyyways, off the politics. Dr. Banks is paired up in this mission with Dr. Ian Donnelly, an expert physicist, played well by Jeremy Renner. This is not your simple alien story, there is a twist thrown in by the brainy humanoid movie director Villeneuve that will throw you for a loop. You can take it to the bank that Adams was robbed of a Best Actress Oscar nomination in her performance as Banks. Eric Heisserer's screenplay of 'Arrival' was earthly sound, even though it had a tad too much of the scientific jargon; but I guess that comes with the sci-fi territory. If you still have not arrived to the viewing landscape of 'Arrival', I suggest you do so now. **** Good",8,0,3,20 February 2017
The Blind Side," Super Sandra does make the cut as one of the best performances of 2009!
","Actress Sandra Bullock is on the top of her game in the sports drama 'The Blind Side'. The movie is based on the real life story of a wealthy southern socialite's caretaking of an underprivileged inner city teen who turned out to be NFL Rookie Left Tackle Michael Oher. His childhood was not too different than other young black boys living in the inner city. His father had mental issues, and his mother was a crack addict trying to raise a handful of children. Young Oher traveled from foster home to foster home during this time. As a teen, Oher was reserved, isolated, and near mute. But one could not be blinded to his enormous body frame and athletic talent. A catholic high school coach gets introduced to Oher and convinces school administration to bring that Oher on board even though he does not have the academic aptitude required in such a school. But here enters Leigh Anne Tuohy, the wealthy wife of a restaurant franchise owner, who takes in the solitaire teen Oher into their home. Leigh Anne has two kids of her own in the sweet teenage girl Collins and the charismatic young boy S.J.; Collins is a bit more reserved at first in welcoming Michael while S.J. adores him from the start. Like S.J., Leigh Anne's husband Sean (played by Tim McGraw, yes that one country boys & girls) is also very supportive of Michael from its huddling beginning. Eventually, the Tuohys become the left and right guards of Michael by becoming his legal guardians. Writer-Director John Lee Hancock does not block the formulaic inspirational & sentimentality themes of most sports films but in 'The Blind Side' but he presents it with goodwill tones instead of salvation armies rah-rah's as most other sports narratives; so kudos to Hancock for his superpower donations in quarterbacking 'The Blind Side'. Hancock's screenplay is a bit clich√© filled but he did open up the lines for some touching messages on caring for others. But what will sweep you away the most of 'The Blind Side' is the commanding performance of Sandra Bullock as the vigorous but yet endearing Leigh Anne Tuohy. All the supporting acting performances follow her lead; but not even in the same 'pro acting bowl' category as hers. Even the great master Bates, (Kathy that is) playing Michaels's tutor could not compare to Bullock's tour-de-force work. It would be complete bullocks if Sandra is not handed off a Best Actress Academy Award. I think I have tackled my viewpoints on 'The Blind Side' so now it is your turn to call your plays on this non-offensive movie which I am sure will open your hearts. ***** Excellent",9,1,2,21 December 2009
Rango," Plenty of boring dirt in Rango, but overall Depp's delight and the classic movies homage makes it a marginal recommendation!
","'Rango Rango Man, I have to see that Rangoman' I said to myself several times in anticipation of the next Johnny Depp starring vehicle 'Rango'. The trailers of this computer-animated movie looked enticing. Come on, Johnny Depp voicing a bug-eyed, fast-talking lizard! How could it miss? But after seeing 'Rango', I must say that I am a bit disappointed. 'Rango' does delight in playing homage to classic movies such as 'Apocalypse Now', '2001: A Space Odyssey', and the infamous 'man with no name' Eastwood westerns. But what 'Rango' dangles primarily on is on its dull narrative. Our protagonist Rango is a lizard drifter (aren't we all?,whatever that means) who ends up in the animal western-town of Dirt. The Mayor of Dirt (voiced by Ned Beatty) does plenty of dirty deeds done first cheap by stealing the town's water for greedy investment purposes; or something like that. That watered-down plot line did stray my attention; it's not like I was watching 'Chinatown'. Rango falls for Beans (voiced by Isla Fisher), a 'looks like a lizard but I cannot make what it is' Dirt animal female who is suspicious of the Mayor's actions and wants to keep the land of her deceased father. Rango, with his wit and fast-talk, ends up convincing most of the town animal residents of Dirt that he is a skilled killer & fighter. The Dirt animals love Rango, he is to them one rocking Rango Star! Rango is then appointed Sheriff and his first sherrify task at hand is to save the Dirt town from being waterless due to their droughtarama. Predictability then ensues as Rango gets into hot water when his Dirt followers found out that he has been deceiving them all this time. Writer John Logan must have not gone into a profuse analytical Logan's writing run with Rango's formulaic script; and to make it worse he even included way too much dialogue incomprehensible for children; who let's face it, is the major demographic target audience of 'Rango' . It appeared to me that Director Gore Verbinski was trying too hard to guide the film with unorthodox elements. Gore, this is not 'The Lizards of the Non-Caribbean: The Curse of the Amphibian World'! However, what rang in quietly nicely in 'Rango' was the stellar talent of Johnny Depp as 'Rango'. I could not envision any other actor but Depp giving 'Rango' his character justice. 'Rango' is a lizard tale that lounges around most of the time, but is salvaged by Depp and that classic movies' homage. *** Average",7,2,7,5 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Bird scores!!!
","It's a bird, It's a plane, actually it is a bird! It's Birdman!!! And definitely one of the best movies of 2014. Alejandro Gonzalez I√±arritu's directed 'Birdman' stars Michael Keaton as Riggan, an aging actor who had his thespian heyday in the early 90's playing an iconic superhero named Birdman. And do I have to hit you with a bat on your head, to discover the irony in this since in the early 90's Keaton himself played.... well, you know the rest, or at least I hope you do. Well, anyways back to the current Riggan era. Riggan is now in production of a Broadway play based on a Raymond Carver novel. He stars, wrote the adaptation, and is directing the play. It is here where 'Birdman' flies with greatness as I√±arritu brilliantly sends us to the backstage Broadway theatre world, and shows us all its complex eccentricities and politics. Alejandro the Great also scribed up a very witty 'Birdman' screenplay with co-writers Nicolas Giacabone, Alexander Dineralis, and Armando Bo. Michael Keaton was more than phenomenal as Riggan, and Keaton is deserving of all the award love he is receiving. The supporting work of 'Birdman' also did not fly the coup. Edward Norton was spectacular as Mike, a feisty Broadway actor. Emma Stone was standout as Riggan's daughter Sam. Zach Galifianakis was superb as Riggan's lawyer Jake. Watts out, here comes another brilliant acting effort from Naomi Watts', here playing the emotional-wreck theatre actress Lesley. And other solid supporting work were delivered by Amy Ryan, Andrea Riseborough, and Lindsey Duncan. But this was really Michael Keaton's main stage, and he kept us birdwatching throughout his stupendous performance. My only minor flaw of 'Birdman' is the one-too-many fantasy-like scenes, but that was just a minor mishap in the 'Birdman' nest. So rise up and catch the 'Birdman'. ***** Excellent",10,6,14,23 December 2014
The Big Short," Big financial words, but not short on creativity! And Bale was the MVP of the Big Short Team!!
","Please don't shortchange me in a big way if I invest in a wealth of puns on my review of the financial dark comedy 'The Big Short'. Writer-Director Adam McKay focuses on a number of financial outcast wizards that via circumstance and research predicted the housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000's. The film was enriched with eccentric characters which gave the film a big bonus; but it was the performances that made its stock rise. Most notably, the great Christian Bale as Dr. Michael Burry, a rebellious glass-eyed financier who noticed the first inkling of the collapse. I hope the Academy does not Bale out Christian in the Best Supporting Actor category. Other fine thespian turns derived from Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and a very brief but whopping performance from Melissa Leo. McKay's direction and script (which he co-wrote with Charles Randolph) is on the epitome of financially complex terminology & comprehension; so it would not be a bad idea to take your personal CFO when heading out to view 'The Big Short'; and yes, multiple viewings is a good idea for further numerical knowledge; and you can take that to the bank! Nevertheless, 'The Big Short' is a fun movie with some very creative bits that you should definitely invest in watching. **** Good",8,3,7,24 December 2015
The Conjuring," 'The Conjuring' does bring down the house!!
","I made a conjugal visit (well, maybe not conjugal) to the horror flick 'The Conjuring', and it was pretty satisfying. The movie stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed & Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators in the early 70's. Ron Livingston & Lili Taylor co-star as Roger & Carolyn Perron, parents of five females who move into a two- story haunting, I mean haunted, farmhouse. So who you gonna call? The Warrens of course for a Warren investigation to lift the spirits, away that is. Director James Wan does wanna keep us spooked, and does a good job of it. The thespian fems Farmiga & Taylor do stand out with their work here, while Wilson & Livingston should have been scared away from the set with their humdrum performances. Hear my voices and give 'The Conjuring' a try. **** Good",8,1,1,1 November 2014
Prometheus," Ridley Scott is a real sci-fi PRO!
","I promise I will not reveal too much about the plot of the Ridley Scott sci-fi sensation 'Prometheus' because that would put me in an illegal alien status for cinematic spoiling. But what I will reveal is that 'Prometheus' is so far the best movie I have traveled to in 2012. The film stars Noomi Rapace who was the girl with the alien I mean dragon tattoo. Rapace stars as Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, a scientist who travels to the darkest portions of the universe in trying to discover the origin of the human race. In her quest, she is accompanied by her scientist boyfriend Dr. Charlie Holloway portrayed by Logan Marshall-Green. They travel with other explorers in the spaceship Prometheus. The P.E.T. (Prometheus Explorer Team) includes the stellar Michael Fassbender who portrays the robotic David with android precision. And there is Idris Elba who plays the ship's captain Janek; and not-to-be-forgotten is the luscious Charlize Theron who portrays Meredith Vickers, the mission's orchestrator who is just going along for the ride due to external pressure from a certain 'Guy' as in Pearce; I will not elaborate on that one. But the star of 'Prometheus' is really the iconic sci-fi auteur Ridley Scott, whose directorial hand was phenomenal in bringing us another sci-fi cinematic discovery. I enjoyed the craftiness of Jon Spaiths and Damon Lindelof's 'Prometheus' screenplay, even with the human-origination discovery quest inclusion which a few critics thought was a bit too clone-like of the one in '2001: A Space Odyssey'. What is definitely looming in the future of Academy Award mankind is Oscar nominations for 'Prometheus' in the visual effects, cinematography, art direction, and editing categories; just some major technicalities there for you. Rapace overacted a tad in the picture as Shaw, but still proved that Noomi is looming for a bright thespian career. The acting showstopper of 'Prometheus' who keeps on ticking throughout the movie was Michael Fassbender as David; there is a scientific possibility that there will be several supporting actor nominations quite possible here for Fassy in the future of the world of award circuits for the year 2012. 'Prometheus' does move a bit slow during its onset; but remember that 'big things have small beginnings'. ***** Excellent",9,5,11,11 June 2012
Despicable Me," Not despicable whatsover!
","'Despicable Me' is not based on Paris Hilton's autobiography, Saddam Hussein's memoirs, or even BP's 2010 annual report. It is an enjoyable computer-animated film about a criminal mastermind named Gru who adopts three little orphan girls in order to use them to seize his shrinking machine from criminal competitor Vector's home. Gru is a stealer at heart and has stolen many renowned monuments, but his astronomical goal is to steal the moon. His plan is to shrink the moon, so he can steal the moon, and he needs his shrink machine to do that. The three little orphan girls named Margo, Edith, and Agnes are oblivious to Gru's mischievous plan. 'Don't Be Gru to a heart that's true' probably is an applicable anthem to describe how eventually Gru softens his sturdy persona, and takes a liking to the three little orphans. Gru's criminal entourage includes the meticulous scientist Dr. Nefario voiced by Russell Brand, and the scene-stealers of the film- that adorable army of minions. I could give you a minion reasons just to watch this movie for their sidesplitting antics. Steve Carell sure was no vocal schmuck with his inventive vocal performance as Gru. And Jason Segel also deserves a shout out with his vocal work as Vector. There were hardly any despicable parts of the direction and screenplay of the movie, even though there were some scenes that ran just a bit too long for what it was. But I go back to the minions, so comical and charming. How does one get them? In other words, 'tell me, tell me, how to be, how to be, a Minionaire'. If you are stumped with that reference, youtube ABC's 'How To Be A Millionaire'. OK, so I am being a despicable punner!!! Anyways, if you are having a despicable summer, get out of it for a little while and experience some comic relief with a 'Despicable Me' viewing. **** Good",8,1,2,31 July 2010
The Queen," Queen's Mirren Logic make it a stellar film
","'The Queen' 'will rock you', and I believe that the monarchical performance of Helen Mirren as your highness will leave all other actress contenders 'biting the dust'. Mrs. Mirren is the clear favorite to be shouting 'I am the champion, my friends' at the Oscar podium for the Best Actress golden boy jewel. OK, so much for the musical Queen homage. The film 'The Queen' unravels itself on the British throne's, primarily Queen Lizzy, reticent reaction to Princess Diana's death. Michael Sheen portrays newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair. He becomes the troubleshoot agent who's challenging task of convincing the Queenie to address the British people on Lady Di's death become a ministerial milestone. Michael Sheen's prime work as Blair ruled! I also hail the rest of the supporting cast of 'The Queen'; James Cromwell as Prince Phillip, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles, and Roger Allam as Robin Janvrin. Peter Morgan's complex but explicable screenplay was a crowd pleaser. However, the king of 'The Queen' was its diversified & acute director, Stephen Frears. Nonetheless, it was Mirren's grandiose acting that is the sure deal of this 'Queen of Art'. *****Excellent",9,1,2,14 December 2006
Blow," Good Movie ! No White Lies!
","`On your mark! Get set and blow!' And prepare yourself to one of the most provocative and entertaining films you will see all year. `Blow' stars Johnny Depp and is based upon the real life story of drug dealer George Jung. Depp's performance as Jung was outstanding and proves again why his outstanding diverse acting is all that is `cracked' up to be.  Ray Liotta was just as good as the trusting father. However, Penelope Cruz as the materialistic drug dealer wife was not a woman on top with her acting. The most surprisingly energetic performance was by Paul Reubens (a.k.a. Pee-Wee Herman) who was once again a master of his domain as the drug dealing homosexual middleman (in more ways than one). All in all, this is one `blow' that does the job right! **** Good",8,52,70,1 May 2001
Straight Outta Compton," Solid play!
","Hello there! I am coming to you live straight outta Punton! Yes, there will be several straight corny puns in my movie review of the music biopic 'Straight Outta Compton', but please don't leave and call the pun police! Director F. Gary Gary's movie tells the tale of the late 80's gangsta rap music group N.W.A.- their rise to stardom, and the turbulence that tore the group apart. The group's infamous artists Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E are the main premise of the movie. Gary's direction was not 'outta this world' but it was very commendable on how he provided a integral perspective of the group's history, and its biographical tunes (I mean, tones) on Dre, Cube, and Eazy. The ensemble acting from young thespians O'Shea Jackson as Cube, Corey Hawkins as Dr. Dre, and Jason Mitchell as Eazy-E was sweet music to my ears; well, maybe not 'sweet' but definitely hardcore effective. Moreover, Paul Giamatti was his usual brilliant self as group manager Jerry Heller; and the hell with all of you who think Giamatti is too loud! I guess that angry rap is getting to me. Anyways, I think it's time to 'rap' this review up, before you get straight outta reading this (if you haven't already). Just keeping it straight! Outta here! **** Good",8,2,26,30 December 2015

Fifty Shades of Grey," My viewing contract expired early in this one!
","Sorry, but I am going to whip, I mean rip this film apart with my review! Oh you poor servants who have been dominated by a novel to go see the film adaptation of 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. Director Sam Taylor-Johnson constructs an uneven, unbridged, and unexciting film in 'Fifty Shades of Grey'. With all due apologies, Taylor-Johnson is the grey goose here. I think she should have spiced it up with an 80's soundtrack consisting of 'Back on the Chain Gang', 'Whip It', and of course 'Sex (I'm A....). As most of you know, this film is about a literary student named Anastasia Steele who meets a young billionaire named Christian Grey. Grey is soft spoken and sly, but he has a fetish for bondage, S&M, whipping, etc. Grey romances Anastasia and tries to persuade her to sign a 'dominant-submissive' to-be-my-lover contract. It was about this time that I felt that the filmmakers of this garbage needed was a good spanking from their studio heads; even though that is far from happening since the movie has brought in chains of box office gold. Jamie Dornan plays Grey and Dakota Johnson is Steele; Dornan was dormant with his performance and Johnson did not provide any scene-steeling work in my book. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was as shady as they come; and I mean that literally. * Failure",4,1,4,2 March 2015
Win Win," McCarthyism continues to be a winning turn!
","Writer-Director Thomas McCarthy's 'Win Win' was such a winning movie that I never wanted it to 'fin fin'. This clever flick stars the always great Paul Giamatti as Mike Flaherty, a middle-aged father of two who has a small law practice which he is struggling to keep afloat. Flaherty moonlights as a coach of a high school wrestling team who is not doing any better than his law practice. In order to wrestle with his economic troubles, Flaherty decides to declare himself a guardian to Leo Poplar, a senior citizen client of his that is going through early stages of dementia. Mike gets a nice chunk of change per month for his guardian duties in 'The Poplar Express'. Unexpectedly, Poplar's teenage grandson Kyle appears on Leo's doorstep but Leo does not live there anymore since Mike put Leo in a senior citizen residential center. Mike then takes in Kyle, and quickly discovers that Kyle is a young wrestling whiz with a troubled past and a despondent mother. You will be gone with the 'Win Win' if I provide you more details on the film's narrative developments. But I must state that this movie is outstanding! Writer-Director Thomas McCarthy has done it again, his first two movies 'The Station Agent' and 'The Visitor' were brilliant, and he delivers the same authentic character development and storyline as those films into the 'Win Win'. Giamatti was spectacular as the conflicted Flaherty, but when is Giamatti not good; he is a literal lock for a 'win win' performance in any movie. No one perfects a character of a gabby dude looking for male- bonding companionship better than Bobby Cannavale; he mastered it as the Cuban-American Ice Cream Truck vendor Joe Aramas in 'The Station Agent', and also crowns it here in 'Win Win' as Mike's best friend and novice assistant wrestling coach Terry Delfino. Jeffrey Tambor was no bore with his comical work as Stephen Vigman, who is Mike's coaching wingman in the wrestling team. Amy Ryan was very sharp and very middle-age hip as Mike's supporting wife Jackie. And newcomer Alex Shaffer pinned in his acting debut nicely with his work as Kyle. It was great to see veteran actor Burt Young back on the top of his game with his very good performance as Leo. McCarthy's superb screenplay deserved a 'win win' or at least a 'nom nom' in the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award category. 'Win Win' is one of my favorite movies of 2011, and its winning formula makes it a viable 'win win' situation for all to see. *****Excellent",9,1,2,11 May 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," What a Knight!!!
","Our 'knight' and shining armor has arrived to save us from the doldrums we sometimes get from summer cinema. He is none other than the Dark Knight himself, Batman! Christopher Nolan has brilliantly directed the final chapter of his highly-acclaimed Batman trilogy with superb precision in 'The Dark Knight Rises'. This masterpiece is set eight years after the events of the 'The Dark Knight'. The city of Gotham is recovered from a crime epidemic but still feeling the loss of former District Attorney Harry Dent, little do they know that guy was a two-face. Bruce Wayne has disappeared from the Gotham spotlight mostly due to the fact that his alter-ego took the rap for Dent's crimes. Bruce is living or not-living (take your pick) a life of hibernation; he can hardly walk and looks very enervated. But things change when a Bane in the ass comes in the picture. That would be the monstrous villain Bane, who viciously takes wrath in Gotham and plans to destroy the city with his buddy Atom 'I am the' Bomb. Bane wears a mask, or more like a headpiece, that covers the central features of his face and head; that actually looks like a humungous respirator. He has a distinct voice and is no Joker with his serious tone. But as the Joker, they rated high in their maniacal evaluation exams. At the same time, we have a fresh pussy that enters the picture, she goes by the name of Selina Kyle, but we know that is no cat in the hat that we are talking about; I have absolutely no idea what that meant. Of course, I am referring to Catwoman. Kyle wastes no time to smoothly enter Bruce's crib and steal away his jewels, but what she actually is looking for is his prints. Anyways, with so much havoc going on, Bruce decides to go up to bat again and save Gotham from Bane and his crew by bringing back out the caped crusader Mr. Batman. 'The Dark Knight Rises' is a grand spectacle and is a cerebral challenge to keep up with narrative, but we must incept our minds that this is a Nolan picture; so pay attention. Nolan and his brother from the same mother Jonathan developed a very polished script that as its predecessor 'The Dark Knight' parallels numerous different themes of present day society. I am going to get technical now and mention that the film's art direction, cinematography, sound effects, visual effects, score, and production design should all rise with Academy Award nomination honors. They were spectacular! Christian Bale has definitely cemented that no one can play Batman as he does. Tom Hardy was quite the warrior with his grandiose performance as Bane. Anne Hathaway was no pussycat (or maybe she was) with her strong performance as Selina Kyle/Catwoman; and also delivered the best lines of the movie. She looked marvelous! That cat could get my tongue anytime! OK, that is enough. Michael Caine once again proved that the Butler did it quite well with his work as Alfred. Other solid thespian work in 'The Dark Knight Rises' included Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon and Marion Cotillard as Bruce's new flame Miranda. And Joseph Gordon-Levitt just levied up his career once again with another sound performance; he portrays the savvy Officer Blake. I am going to conclude my 'The Dark Knight Rises' review by mentioning that the conclusion of this movie is one of the best of all-time in motion picture history. OK, I am going to call it a Knight, and cap off my review of 'The Dark Knight Rises' by stating that this by far is the best movie of 2012. Knighty-knight. ***** Excellent",10,6,14,22 July 2012
Any Given Sunday," I will have to settle for a field goal with this one!
","There has not been a more controversial director in the last ten years than Oliver Stone. With any given movie he directs- he brings us distracting, but yet, powerful images of the film's subject matter. Now Stone has decided to engrave himself into the world of the National Football League. `Any Given Sunday' is about the glitz, glamour, pathos, greed, and hypocrisy of the NFL. The film is full of pro bowl actors. Some of them did touch down with their performances ( Al Pacino, James Woods, Jamie Foxx), while others did not backup some of their fine work in earlier films (Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, Mathew Modine). Oliver does twist the plot a few times to surprise the viewer. However, I do have to blow the whistle on the film's length. This movie should definitely not have gone into overtime.  I will defend those who did like this movie but at the same time I will not offend those who did not like it either. *** Average",6,0,0,26 September 2000
Iron Man," Nothing erroneous about this Ironious film!
","Man, did I feel popcorn entertainment at the pinnacle point of 2008 when my adrenaline was running sky high as I was watching the superhero film extraordinaire 'Iron Man'. Robert Downey Jr. stars as Tony Stark, a billionaire weapons-manufacturer who gets captured by Middle Easterns who hold him captive in an Afghanistan prison cave. Stark uses his weaponry intellect, charismatic persona, and creative ingenuity in creating and becoming Iron Man to plan the Great Escape; eventually Stark sparks up Iron Man with precision robotics after his escapade. Sparks' assistant Pepper Potts is about the only female species who could probably tame the womanizing Tony. Let's just say that Iron Man had been pumping iron with the ladies even before Pepper sneezed in his life. Obadiah Stone is Sparks' shady business partner who might just turn out to be 'obadass' villain of Iron Man. Jim Rhodes is the colonel pal of Tony who also moonlights as Sparks' public relations military 'rhodie', sort-of-speak. I will not reveal more of Iron Man because I think you are going to have to iron out the facts and rough spots (if any) yourself by viewing 'Iron Man'. Director Jon Favreau, who starred in the indie classic 'Swingers' and directed the hilarious 'Elf', swings into blockbuster heaven big-time with his astonishing architecture of 'Iron Man'. Could be one of the premier directorial efforts of the year! Way to go Favs! Downey Jr. was the most ironic actor to play Sparks because Robert was used to living a fast 'shoot them up' lifestyle (as Iron Man) in his real life when he fought a profound drug addiction problem back in the 90's; But just like Iron Man, Downey Jr. was able to get down from his high in the nick of time before facing the valley of death. Robert Downey Jr.'s heavy thespian work as Tony Sparks/Iron Man might just land him a Gold Man Best Actor nomination. Gwyneth Paltrow pushed her 'acting real good' as the Pepper to her Sparks or otherwise known as Sparks & Pepper. In seriousness, it was Paltrow's best work in a decade. Jeff Bridges was 'metally' tough as villainous steel as the greedy Obadiah Stone/Iron Monger. Terrence Howard, a great actor of our present generation, was adequate here as Colonel Rhodes but did not fire the same acting super missiles as Downey Jr., Paltrow, and Bridges. 'Iron Man' was also a special effects spectacle and an art direction delight. So strike the iron while its hot (made $105 million on its opening weekend) and program yourself to the 'Iron Man'. It was simply Marvelous! ***** Excellent",10,2,7,5 May 2008
Mother!," WTF in full gear!
","Hey, I am always up for some daring & strange movies; but never did I expect the mother f**king rapid-fire lunacy of Darren Aronofsky's 'Mother!'. It's like if Darren took all the drugs he showcased in his classic 'Requiem for a Dream' while writing and directing 'Mother!'' OK, maybe it's not that crazy; wait, it is that crazy. Love it or hate it, the main tagline for this movie's ads are correct; there is no other movie like it, which it does not necessarily mean it's a good thing. This is the no-name defense I mean movie. There are no character names in the movie. 'Mother!' stars Jennifer Lawrence as Mother. She is married to Him, as in Javier Bardem's character. Him and Mother live in a countryside solitary two story house. Him is a poet; Mother is a housewife; still with me? Him is like twenty years older than Mother; that sounds strange. Him and Mother start getting visits from zany strangers; primarily in particular a dying man named Man; but of course; and his rude wife named (you guessed it) Woman. Man and Woman are played by Ed Harris and Michele Pfeiffer. Then all of a sudden, 'Mother!' goes into rapid fire 'cray cray' mode with more strangers visiting Mother and Him. Listen, I do credit Aronofsky in his daring direction, but this was waaaay too much. It just gets bombarded and overflown with ludicrous scenes. Jennifer Lawrence, whose character gets quite a beating, was strong as Mother. And Michele Pfeiffer is always quite the Woman, and she acted the part also quite right as Woman. Bardem and Harris were modest, but I think they were outshined by their female counterparts. I do recommend quite a motherload of alcoholic beverages before experiencing 'Mother!'; to say the least. *** Average",6,1,7,16 September 2017
Bruce Almighty," Almighty Carrey!
","`Bruce Almighty' will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass `Titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would possess the powers of God. That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carrey's new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty'. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the `Gift of God'(his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do God's job any better. Obviously, Bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not `mis.pittiful' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty' is not the most in-depth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `Carreyism'! **** Good",8,0,0,26 May 2003
Casino Royale," Good, Very Good
","I do have to give the latest Bond release the royale or should I say the royal treatment. It was popcorn entertainment at its apex. Daniel Craig plays all the right cards in 'Casino Royale' as the new James Bond. This blonde Bond will bond with many Bond films aficionados which prefer a more rugged, menacing Bond. The film is based on the Ian Fleming novel that focuses on 007's early days. Jimmy boy's nemesis this time is Le Chiffre played by Mads Mikkelsen; Chiffre is a corrupt banker, who like most antagonists in Bond films or in all action films for that matter, do their malevolence stuff to collect a whole bunch of mula. Le Chiffre's obscure peculiarity is that he cries blood. Yes, he is Le Chief of the 'bloodshot eyes' and contrary to popular belief not Mel Gibson. James and Le Chiffre duel it out in a cerebral casino card match and eventually in more hands-on type of matches. Eva Green plays Vesper Lend, a feminist accountant who lends her wisdom to James but initially not her body. Green is incandescent and has to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. 'Casino Royale' stirs it up with plenty of classic Bond action sequences that are gripping and exhilarating. Director Martin Campbell's 'soup'er dexterity in constructing 'Casino Royale' was commending. The only misfire in 'Casino Royale' was its semi-droning screenplay. In summary, I hope you feel that my film review for 'Casino Royale' was naught shaky and immensely stirring. **** Good",8,1,5,16 December 2006
Toy Story 3," Yea Toyyyyyy!!!
","I do sincerely apologize for being punfully playful in my movie review of the extra charming 'Toy Story 3'. Yes once again, I will be a Mr. Puntatohead! 'Toy Story 3' is a room full of entertainment heaven. It is that good! I am not toying with you! This Toy story picks up when a grown Andy is preparing to leave to college, and unsure on what to do with his classic toys he has cherished throughout his past childhood. The same cast of Andy Toy characters are back; of course headed by Woody The Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear. But as the last Toy story, new toys are introduced to this story including a toy boy for Barbie, and that would be none other than Ken. The Andy toy family eventually end up in a day care center called Sunnyside, even though the toys end up being more scrambled than sunnyside up by a feisty group of toddlers. The so-called toy leader at the Sunnyside Daycare is a conniving bear called Lotso, who has lotso devious plans to hold the Andy toy entourage as prisoners. However, Toy Story 3's primary premises play more with the concept of the agony & denial of 'letting go', and the togetherness of loved ones. Not to mention, the specialness effect that childhood toys could have on one throughout an entire lifetime. There were a few handkerchief moments in the teary story of 'Toy Story 3'. Academy Award winning screenwriter Michael Arndt scribed an exuberant and heartwarming screenplay which should present him a revisit to the Oscar red carpet. Director Lee Unkrich was precise with his handling of these toys, and the rest of the Pixar clan were once again terrific. And woodynt you know it, the vocal performances of Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz, and Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head were a thing of beauty! I especially liked Michael Keaton's vocal work as Ken. In no way, shape or form 'Toy Story 3' belongs in the toylet. It is a classic tale that both children and adults will adore, even though some kids might not see a baby doll the same way again. The final buzz is that 'Toy Story 3' will live in all us for infinity and beyond. And that truth is not light years away! ***** Excellent",9,1,2,27 June 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Scratatouille Ice Ice Baby steals the show!
","Scrat the Squirrel is on the dawn of finally hitting the utopia of Squirrelism by capturing the beloved acorn. That is until his whirling squirling hormones get the worst of him and he falls for a sabre-toothed female squirrel named Scratte; who evidently wants a piece of that herself. Piece being Scrat or the Acorn? OK, so that was not the best way to break the ice in my review of 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'. What do you expect? I first wrote it in 'scrat paper'. This third installment of the infamous Ice herd franchise does have numerous comedic dawning moments that come mostly in the form of the aforementioned Scrat adventures. The male procrastinating complexities of choosing love or gratification are in a way symbolized in Scrat's dilemma of deciding between Scatte's love or the tempting acorn. OK, that was way too 'acorny' and unforgivably deep! Sorry, it is just that I am still living in the Pun Age, and this is the Dawn of the Punasours. OK, I will stop. All punning aside, Scrat once again shows that he is the superstar of the Ice Age installment. Herd, do not misunderstand! Heard me? Not to take anything away from your stellar lineup including the mammoth stars Manny and Ellie, the cerebrally-challenged sloth Sid, the feisty sabre-tooth tiger Diego, and the screwy possums Eddie & Crash. It is just that Scrat rocked the Ice Age House once more! In this Ice Age narrative- Ellie is pregnant carrying Manny's little mammoth baby, Sid wants to be a dad of his own so he steals three dinosaur eggs, and an aging & unmotivated Diego is trying to recapture the 'eye of the tiger'. Through some Sid-witted disasters, the herd end up in a dinosaur underworld chased by a gargantuan Dino mom who wants her triplets back from Sid, and a even more grandiose dinosaur named Rudy who is just plain rude. The herd befriends a one-eye weasel named Buck who lives in the underworld and ends up being their key to escape. But does the herd end up getting a bang out of their Buck? I am going to have to pass the Buck on this one, and let you figure it out yourself. Some critics have given 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs' a cold-hearted reception and have ridiculed Co-directors Carlos Saldanha and Mike Thurmeier for not bringing more originality to the story. They do have some valid arguments with those theories, but the hotness of the 'Ice Age' movies has never been the story, it has been the characters. And I think that these herd of characters were once again marvelous and should not be inserted in the endangered movies franchise list. Chill out til dawn with 'Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs'. I am scratting out of here! **** Good",8,1,3,15 July 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' is a winning trifecta of an excelente pelicula
","The latest Woody Allen cinematic offering 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' sure sent out a few 'Woodys' to male filmgoers. Two words: Scarlett Johansson! Is there a more cinematic picturesque acting beauty than Scarlett? I think not. However, I am not going to get let my male hormones invade the film review of this very witty and delightful film. 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' stars Javier Bardem as Juan Antonio, a Spaniard painter who meets and fancies two gorgeous American female tourists visiting Barcelona for the summer named (yea you guessed it) Vicky and Cristina. Rebecca Hall plays the perspicacious Vicky while Johansson plays the free-spirited Cristina. The unruffled Juan Antonio offers Vicky and Cristina a flight to a nearby Spanish town, good wine, exquisite food, and a 'make love' offer that he does not want them to refuse. The latter would fall into the entitlement of 'Vicky Cristina Off Pantalones'. Vicky is engaged to be married to a cookie-cutter yuppie named Doug so she rejects the making love portion of the Juan Antonio proposition, while Cristina is all down for the Juan Antonio seduction expedition. Cristina eventually does develop a relationship with Juan Antonio, but a Spanish 'new order' is intertwined in a 'bizarre love triangle' fashion when Juan Antonio's fiery ex-wife Maria Elena gets in the picture that eventually converts into a m√©nage a trios Barcelona style; Si Baby! However, the film's central focus is on Vicky's insecurities & neurosis on her relationship with Doug and her uncontainable desirable feelings for Juan Antonio. I think Batman is no longer my summer movie hero, gotta make the change for Juan Antonio; three beautiful women lusting for him, Do I say more? Legendary auteur Woody Allen scripted a brainy but relatable script on passion, love, and romance. He also helmed the picture with an effective unpredictable storyline manner that also had the fringe Spanish benefit of showing us viewers splendid cultural cinematography of beautiful Barcelona. No actor could have played the Juan Antonio role better than Bardem; I will call it 'friendo' that Bardem will be one our finest male thespians in years to come. Newcomer Rebecca Hall is no kid in the lonely acting hall anymore with her breakthrough performance as Vicky, and Scarlett Johannson as Cristina is proving that she continues to be an effective muse to Woody; do not take that literally. Nonetheless, it is Penelope Cruz's performance as the fervent Maria Elena which should be cruising her to a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination. So reserve your one-way (or three-way) movie ticket to Spain and visit the luscious and passionate land of 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'. ***** Excellent",10,9,21,21 August 2008
Identity," Tough to ID this one!
","`Identity' valiantly tries to replicate an identity of various Alfred Hitchcock's suspenseful classics. However, the results for the most part is an identity crisis. Ok! Let me get to `Identity's' identity: several unrelated group of suspicious characters hibernate to a highway motel on a rainy evening (`Psycho' anyone?) and before you know it the body count commences. I am sure you can identify with some films that present the same violentiosco plot. The actors in `Identity' are renowned and easy to identify: John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Amanda Peet, Alfred Molina, and Rebecca De Mornay. However, this acting ensemble was mostly middling here. `Identity' was suspenseful in several homage Hitchcockian scenes. However, the problem was that Director James Mangold became a bit psychotic with the multitudinous repetition of them. Mangold turned out to be `The Man Who Knew Too Little' about direction in this project. He was `Notorious'! `Identity' identifies several suspenseful elements of effective storytelling, but for the most part this one was for `The Birds'. *** Average",6,1,2,12 July 2004
Saving Mr. Banks," It's Super.............. (fill in the rest)!!!!
","'Saving Mr. Banks' is a 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' flick about how the Disney classic 'Mary Poppins' popped into its development. The movie stars Emma Thompson as P.L. Travers, the author of the 'Mary Poppins' novel who refused for years for her eye-popping book to be adapted into a Disney movie no matter how eagerly Sir Walt Disney tried to persuade her. Due to financial problems, Travers reluctantly takes the road well-traveled and decides to travel to Hollywood and meet with Walt and the Disney movie clan. However, she does have lots of reservations about how Disney wants to tinker with her 'Mary Poppins'. Sorry that I am feeding you a spoonful of puns, by the way. 'Saving Mr. Banks' delves in also to Travers' childhood, most notably her relationship with her loving, but alcoholic father. But the magic of this movie is witnessing the interactions between Walt Disney and P.L. Travers. Director John Lee Hancock, who previously helmed 'The Blind Side', opens our eyes on dreams, imagination, wonder, adversity, insistence, and of course magic; which are all elements Hancock had a hand in to make 'Saving Mr. Banks' worth the ride. Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith's screenplay was divine. Thompson's performance was excellent as Travers, and it was a bit of a travesty that she did not get nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. Tom Hanks not only helped save Private Ryan, but also had a hand in 'Saving Mr. Banks' with his superb charismatic performance as Walt Disney himself. Other worthy supporting turns came from Colin Farrell as Travers' father, Paul Giamatti as Disney limo driver Ralph, and B.J. Novak & Jason Schwartzman as film composers Robert & Richard Sherman. 'Saving Mr. Banks' is a lovely movie that everyone should experience, and you can take that to the bank. ***** Excellent",9,0,1,18 May 2014
Son of Saul," No Saul I mean Sell for me here!
","The Oscar-winning Hungarian Holocaust movie 'Son of Saul' has received a bountiful of critical and award love. I don't wanna sound like a sour grape, but this sour movie did not move me at all; you want more Saul on your entertainment taste, 'Better Call Saul' instead. In all seriousness, 'Son of Saul' stars Geza Rohrig as Saul, a 1944 Auschwitz Jewish prisoner who is forced to burn corpses of his own people. Saul is presented with a dilemma when he sees his son is in the group next in line to be incinerated. Saul then goes on a conquest for his son not to be one of them. He takes heavy risks, connives his allies, all the works really for his son not to be put in flames. Director Lazlo Nemes shoots the picture in close proximity with the lead character, which I found it to be very irritating instead of capturing. I was trying to be Finding Nemes in Nemes' chronological work, but it seems this was his first real picture; and it showed. I am sorry to say nothing struck me profoundly in 'Son of Saul'; not the directing, the writing, nor the acting. And yes, I do think it's extremely overrated. But maybe, me who is the Son of Jose (dad's name) just did not see 'Son of Saul' the way others did. ** Needs Improvement",5,1,2,10 April 2017
Am√©lie," Nice Import but Not Great!
","`Amelie' is being called the toast of France. Critics amor `Amelie'. They are calling it one of the best French films of all time. Now, I did think it was cute but I do think that some of these critics are french toasted by including it in that illustrious category. The film is about a cute- petite French woman who gets satisfaction out of doing favors for others and changing their lives. Now, I did like the premise (especially in today's times). However, I did think the film dragged as long as the Tour De France. Guys- I do not think that you will like this film too much. However, I do know a way to change that. Just tell your girl that you want to have a very romantic French night that would have to include- viewing a French film like `Amelie', doing some serious French kissing during the boring scenes of the film, and maybe ask her to get a friend and do a serious menage a trois (that's French isn't) during the film's climax. If you view it that way, I am sure it will be one of your favorite films of all time. *** Average",7,0,1,24 December 2001
Moonrise Kingdom," Moonstruck with Moonrise Kingdom! But I do not think it belongs in the kingdom as one of the best films of 2012!
","The Wes Anderson quirky flick 'Moonrise Kingdom' is not for everyone; but when we are talking about Wes-stern films, you must know that they are for an acquired taste. His movies are infamous for being unorthodox and strange, which is very similar to my movie reviews minus the wisdom. I personally like many of his films, even though I found a couple of them disappointing; 'Moonrise Kingdom' is not one of them. It is very good, even though I do not like it as much as many critics and pseudo-critics do; I belong in the latter category by the way. 'Moonrise Kingdom' is set in an island village near the coast of (oops, I forgot!). I should have listened more to the film's Narrator who was marvelously played by Bob Balaban. The movie really stars two unknown child actors, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward as Sam and Suzy. They meet and young love commences. Sam belongs to a Scout Troop group, but runs that coup to meet with young Suzy for a childhood romantic adventure. Sam is an orphan, who is a misfit with the rest of his scout peers. Suzy comes from an upper-middle class family that has its share of dysfunction. Suzy rebels against her parents, who are both lawyers. She also has an anger management problem, but takes a sweet liking to Sam. So therefore they plan the 'Summer of Sam and Suzy'. Edward Norton co-stars as Scout Master Ward who is distraught that one of his scouts has runaway, of course I am referring to Sam. Bill Murray and Frances McDormand portray Suzy's parents, Walt and Laura Bishop. They are also in disarray when Suzy goes missing. Bruce Willis has been a die-hard fan of Anderson movies, so he rolls into this one as the Island Police Captain Sharp. Willis' sharp performance as the Captain was king. The rest of the cast was also quite sharp, I must say. Besides the aforementioned actors, we also had some good thespian work from Tilda Swinton as a Social Service Agent who went by the name 'Social Services'; (you gotta love it), and also from Jason Schwartzman as Uncle Ben, I mean Cousin Ben (sorry I had too much rice). Anderson's direction and writing was worthy, even though he did not bring anything new to the cinematic table which he has not done before. 'Moonrise Kingdom' contains the same Anderson ingredients as his past films: family dysfunction, emotionless expressions, and tactile objects as narrative centerpieces, etc. etc. etc. My favorite 'Moonrise Kingdom' feature was its spectacular cinematography. Many are predicting that 'Moonrise Kingdom' will thy kingdom come to the Academy Award spotlight with several nominations. I would not put it in that pedestal, but I have no reservations why you should not scout out 'Moonrise Kingdom'. **** Good",8,1,2,22 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Out of this world!!!
","First and foremost: I would like for you to read my review of 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens'; but remember I don't like to leave my hand solo without writing puns in movie reviews. For those two or three humanoids who still have not seen 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens', I promise not to play the part of Darth Spoiler in my review of this riveting installment of what is probably the most popular movie franchise of all time. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is set around 40 years after 'The Return of the Jedi'. Three decades after the defeat of the Galactic Empire, a new threat arises. The First Order attempts to rule the galaxy and only a rag-tag group of heroes can stop them, along with the help of the Resistance. Director J.J. Abrams definitely was not spaced out with his orchestration of the movie, as he brilliantly incorporates the vintage Star Wars elements, with an invigorated new narrative. It involves a fugitive stormtrooper named Finn, who wants to put a fin to his trooper-served time; I guess he wasn't a real stormtrooper. And a pretty scavenger named Rey, who is really the reigning character of the movie; let's just say Rey's role is as pivotal as it comes in a Star Wars flick. Now for the Old School of Star Wars; yes there are sightings of classic Star Wars characters and several are imperative in the film's narrative, But I will not be the only-one can-open the secrets of their roles in this installment; I will say that young actors Daisy Ridley as Rey and John Boyega as Finn conducted forceful performances; the pressure was on and they delivered. Now to the dark side, which would come in the form of the primary villain here- Kylo Ren portrayed with edgy fierce by Adam Driver. Yea, he bad, yea, he loves the Darth. Come on, it's the dark side, what you expect! A few other laser points before I depart the Pun Star: Harrison Ford is back with his exceptionally clever badass wit with his work as Mr. Solo, and Carrie Fisher was gently effective as the former Princess now General Leia. And then there is that Luke dude.... So anyways, may the puns be with you; and yea, don't forget to watch this little space flick, if you haven't already. ***** Excellent",10,8,40,23 December 2015
RED," Badass Red Army!
","Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Red alert! Redrum! Redrum! Redrum! OK, how did that transform itself into a critical warning to a creepy 'murder spelled backwards' fixation? I just wanted to provide this review an initial 'Shining' moment. OK, enough. I am here to review the action-comedy 'Red'. So 'rede' or not, here I come. At first, I was a little puzzled upon seeing that 'Red' was nominated for a Best Motion Picture (Comedy/Musical) Golden Globe nomination last year. But I must admit now that 'Red' was a viable nominee. I had much fun watching this movie about retired black-ops agents who reassemble their team when retired ops leader Frank Moses is targeted by a group of assailants who might very well have government connections. 'Red' stands for retired and extremely dangerous, which fits the bill these days of Regis Philbin, George Bush (both of them), and Joan Rivers (is she retired?). Director Robert Schwentke excels in keeping the 'Red' action unpredictable with a nice touch of sarcastic comedy, due much to the on- target screenplay of Jon & Erich Hoeber. The geriatric and non-geriatric cast of 'Red' was stellar, even though that is 'old news' since this movie was released last year. Bruce Willis was vintage Bruce with his wily performance as Frank Moses. Malkovich! Malkovich! Malkovich! Sorry, I got a bit excited that the actor human being John Malkovich was in this movie, and delivered yet another scene-stealing performance as retired ops Marvin Boggs. Morgan Freeman as retired ops Joe Matheson did not have to do much acting, but his presence is always welcome in any movie even when his narration is not required. Damn was Dame Helen Mirren good as the badass retired ops Victoria, and they give her a machine gun in this one! Yea Baby! Other great supporting turns came in the way of Brian Cox playing Russian inside man Ivan Simanov, Karl Urban as CIA Agent William Cooper, and the lovely Mary-Louise Parker as Moses' romantic interest Sarah Ross. So head on over to the 'red light district' and get the red out and get your DVD or Blu-Ray Player ready for 'Red'. **** Good",8,5,6,22 December 2011
Flight," Book it! 'Flight' is worth the trip!
","The plight of 'Flight' could have been more focused on the disaster of an airplane going down in fuels and how it impacted the crew and the passengers, in more of the 'disaster' genre category. But I am glad that renowned Director Robert Zemeckis kept the movie more focused on depicting one man's denial of his profound alcohol dependency problem. And no, this movie is not a sequel to Zemeckis' 'The Polar Express' so you can take out 'The Polar Beer Express' as a title that could have worked. Anyways, that man is airline pilot Whip Whitaker piloted to perfection by the great Denzel Washington. Whip likes to whip it good on the bourbon, whiskey, beer, vodka, and the occasional line of cocaine. The only problem (actually, not the only problem) is that Whip gets a potential whipping when its revealed through toxicology reports that he piloted a plane more than legally drunk that took the lives of six and injured many, including Whip. The first portion of 'Flight' is on how Whitaker was able to maneuver a defected plane from crashing; and due to his expert piloting skills, he was able to land the plane in an open field even through its rough landing. But when you are high in the skies as a kite, and you are drunk as a skunk in the pit, it's just not a good thing. After the crash, Whitaker befriends a heroin addict Nicole in the hospital where he is staying due to his injuries in the crash. Nicole is a 'down & out of luck' woman who has no one else to turn to; that is until Whip takes a liking to her and invites her into his own cockpit, I mean secluded farm home of course. Whip is in a whip of trouble due to the negligence of piloting the plane drunk, so his lawyer buddy Charlie Anderson contracts the services of Union Counsel Hugh Lang so he can Lang I mean land himself out of this mess. Zemeckis takes some great shots of 'Flight' in focusing on a man's constant denial of his alcoholism even though the protagonist's dire situations get worse and worse. And that is what maneuvers 'Flight' into authenticity, even through a bit of predictable forecasting of how it all turns out. Kudos also goes out to Zemeckis' co-pilot, who would be Screenwriter John Gatins for his strong scribe of 'Flight'. Denzel Washington's starring performance is one the best of his stellar career, and should land him yet another Best Actor Oscar nomination. John Goodman yet delivers another show-stopping supporting acting performance as Whip's drug dealer pal Harling Mays. And the rest of the supporting thespian crew of 'Flight' was not half bad. Kelly Reilly was solid as Nicole. And veteran actors Bruce Greenwood and Don Cheadle added more to their impressive thespian resumes with their legal & good work here portraying lawyers Charlie Anderson and Hugh Lang. Oscar-winner Melissa Leo was sturdy in her brief role as a hardball investigator. 'Flight' is not dead on arrival and in the ends in departs into a satisfying trip even with the heavy subject matter. So book your next cinematic trip on this 'Flight'. ***** Excellent",9,2,4,8 December 2012
Unbroken," Liked this movie better when it was called 'Rescue Dawn', and that was a much better movie!
","'Punbroken' is the story of how I got pun writer's block!! Wait, Wait don't leave! Angelina Jolie's 'Unbroken' is based on the incredible true story of Olympian track runner Louis Zamperini. Louie Louie won full medal in the 1936 Olympics, and then went full metal by joining the armed forces. During his tour duty in World War II, Louie was involved in a plane crash that left him and two of his fellow patriotas in a life boat for close to two months. Louie was rescued from death on the lifeboat, but the bad news is that it was the enemy Japanese who did it; consequently, Louie was a prisoner of war in two concentration camps. Jolie directed 'Unbroken' by mostly concentrating on the concentration camp, and lacked character development of her protagonist. The infamous Coen Brothers wrote the film's screenplay, and surprisingly so it was an 'uncoen'-like script that lacked ingenuity. Jack O' Connell did deliver a bravo performance as Zamperini. Also, there was some solid cinematography by the cine steady Roger Deakins. But those pluses were not enough to fully salvage and rescue 'Unbroken' from the mediocre cinema concentration camp. *** Average",7,3,6,24 January 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Thank You Very Much King!
","Come on, my precious master readers and follow me as I will take you to my film reviews of the first two installments of `Lord of the Rings- Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers' which I praised as one of the best fantasy films of all time. Come on my precious readers, do not read the film reviews of that fat hobbit I mean critic Roger Ebert. My reviews of `Lord of the Rings' are more profound and better articulated than those of that fat critic.  Follow me my precious readers to my reviews. Mr. Frodo, I mean readers is a trap! Do not read Meeza's relentless derogatory reviews of the first 2 installments of `Lord of the Rings'. It's too late! Here they are:
Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingOh!!!!!! Lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I could not understand why `The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' was nominated for so many Oscars? In fact, my fellow man, I think this film should be shipped right out of every multiplex cinema in the country. I was never engaged to this ring tale about wizards, hobbits, and dragons. I hope the film chokes and has a severe case of `ring around the collar' on Oscar night.  I did not like anything about this film! The wizards should be locked up in `Oz' prison, the hobbits were very earrryyyy, and the dragons should have stayed in their dungeon. All in all, the only finger that would fit in this ring story would be my√Ç‚Ä¶. ( I think you can fill in the blanks.) * FailureLord of the Rings: The Two TowersWe have witnessed another melancholic Two Towers tragedy. That is the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'. This ring also fits into the hand of pathetic cinema just as the one of the previous fellowship. The film brings back all of its characters: hobbits Frodo & Sam, Gandalf the Wizard, hobbit defender Aragorn, and all the rest of these ludicrous characters who are more reminiscent of `Ringling Circus' animals than Lords of Rings.   My quest, just as it was last year, is for this ring version to get destroyed at Oscar night and not receive any major wins. * Failure
Ok! So this is not in the same category of a Gollum trap, but as you noticed I was not the biggest fan of the first 2 installments of `The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. However, I must bow my head for the final installment of the trilogy `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. This is not a Meeza Gollum trap! I really enjoyed this one! It is a visual spectacle! Director Peter Jackson has to be commended for his extraordinary direction. This Action Jackson will not molest children but yet entertain them with the film's thrilling battlefield sequences. Sorry Michael!  He He! Sean Astin was very inspirational as an undersized linebacker (oops! wrong Astin movie) I mean oversized hobbit. It is worthy of a Best Supporting Actor Nomination. It was a pleasure to observe how all the pieces of the puzzle came together for all the film's characters in the trilogy's final installment. However, I am still puzzled that I actually enjoyed `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. Could it be that my new hobby is now to continuously watch these hobbit tales? I hardly think so. However, `Return of the King' was fantasy film cinema at its supreme! I guess because of the film's astronomical profits and award accolades one can say that `It's Good to be the King!' **** Good",8,1,2,21 January 2004
The Purge," I am guilty of liking this film! Suspend me if you like!
","Wow! I just heard about a new law that allows one to pun endlessly for a 12 hour period with no 'punalties' involved! This way everyone can release their urges to pun away without getting a one way trip to Cheesyville. Loving it! Anyways, not to worry, that will not be the premise of my following review of the horror flick 'The Purge'. But I had to open my review that way because that is the premise of the movie, but not with puns but with crime. The movie is set in the not-so- distance future where the US government has made it legal to commit criminal activity once a year in a 12 hour period; this way people could release their urges to be naughty; it's called the Purge. Ethan Hawke stars as James Sandin, a security surveillance sales representative who splurges the opportunity to sell equipment to neighbors and others for Purge protection. When things go array during the year's Purge period, Sandin is in a desperate situation to save his family from a group of ruthless youth who want to kill a homeless man who made his way in the Sandin residence. Writer-Director James DeMonaco did not exactly receive filmmaker monarchy status with his orchestration of 'The Purge', but he does an admirable job in keeping us guiltily entertained. The movie is no Shining, and does have an extremely short punning I mean running time. However, if you want to splurge on horror, 'The Purge' should be activated. **** Good",8,0,0,5 January 2014
Munich," My Munichcipalaties have decided that this film deserves a Silver medal!
","Steven Spieldberg has been praised as the premier 'gold medal' director in cinematic history. There are many that share that sentiment while others that opinion that he is more in the 'silver or bronze' auteur medal category. Why I am I getting into such a 'medalica' state in describing Spieldberg's career? Because his latest controversial flick is inspired by true events of a historic horrific Olympic tragedy. Many know it as Black September. It was during the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich when 11 Israeli athletes & coaches were assassinated by a Palestinian terrorist group. The premise of 'Munich' is what happened next. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir ordered a vengeance strike against the Palestinians planners of Black September. The Israeli covert revenge team was led by a former security officer turned agent named Avner. His subordinates were comprised of a former toymaker now bomb crafter, a forgery specialist, a practical agent, and an experienced schematic hit specialist. These Mossad agents are not exactly the Israeli armed forces 'high five' but remember the operation was very clandestine one. The main focal point is that they seek revenge for Munich, non-stop. It is no bullocks that the film has sparked up controversy from Palestinian and even Israeli groups. Palestinians state that Spieldberg depicts them as unmerciful terrorists while Israelis state that he was too lenient against the non-pals Palestis. Personally, I thought Spieldberg was too harsh against his own Israelis, 'jew' know what I mean. Hey, if this film is controversial why can't this review be of the same caliber? The film's 'message for peace' signifies that revenge is useless and non-resolving by having Israeli apply egoistic vengeful tactics. Eric Bana executed a Herculean performance as Avner. Bana masterfully portrayed Avner as a righteous family man, a devoted countryman, and later a conflicted hit-man. Spieldberg's recreation of the Munich horror integrated with actual footage was resourceful and effective. The screenplay of 'Munich' was complex, but yet, suspenseful. Writers Tony Kushner and Eric Roth did give 'Munich' justice by giving Spieldberg their 'words'. Undoubtedly, Spieldberg has developed a cerebral film. 'Munich' is not a masterpiece, but it is startling enough for one never to forget that striking back is the same as striking out. Games Over! **** Good",8,2,3,2 April 2006
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," I may catch fire for this, but I did not love this one!
","'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' did not deliver the fiery passion of the original. However, I think devoted fans of the novels probably will catch a lot more from this one than those who did not hit 'The Hunger Games' books. Nevertheless, I feel that Director Francis Lawrence was no Sir Francis in keeping the movie-going audience vastly entertained with this edition. Maybe my appetite for 'The Hunger Games' relinquished after seeing more of a forces of nature aspect to this sequel, while the original had more a thirst for survival appetite. Oscar-winning screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt did not scribe up a magnetic screenplay, even though maybe what Simon says was not too Ardntly; OK, I am catching fire with these cheesy puns. Jennifer Lawrence does shine here again as Katniss Everdeen; The J-Law is still in effect and is here to stay. Woody Harrelson also delivered charismatically once again as Haymitch; so cheers to that. Donald Sutherland also demonstrated that his senior years have not affected his thespian brilliance portraying here proficiently the ruthless President Snow; so yea, let it Snow, let it Snow, let it Snow for this trilogy. And there is the masterful Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman. The rest of the acting of the movie was just subpar which includes that 'I rather be eating Pita bread' than watching Josh Hutcherson's humdrum performance as Hunger Gamer Peeta Mellark; or maybe I am just writing a whole bunch of Mellarky. Anyways, it's worth catching 'Catching Fire' but you will probably be left tasting for more. *** Average",7,6,24,29 November 2013

Do you know what The Matrix really is? It is a very boring science fiction film about a man's battle in a computer generated world. It is also a movie with some very bad acting that all stars with the king of bad acting- Keanu Reeves. Whoa! I forgot something else. It is also 7 dollars drown the drain if you check this one out in the theatre. I do have to admit that the special effects were spectacular.

50_50," I give 50/50 more than a 50/50 chance to have movie staying power!
","Due to my over 50 certifiable corny puns that I insert in my film reviews, there will be most probably more than a 50/50 chance that you will find my review of the new comedy-drama '50/50' very 'repunant'. See what I mean! Anyways, let me cut to the chase. '50/50' stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Adam, a Seattle radio journalist who in his mid 20's is diagnosed with a form of spinal cancer; too 'syllabistic' to pronounce. Adam, as anyone would be, is first stricken back with his diagnosis and even though he maintains his resiliency is still internally profoundly hurt with the situation. He finds some sort of zany support from his best friend Kyle, who is with Adam through the cancer battle, but actually uses Adam's sickness to meet beautiful women. Kyle is portrayed by Seth Rogen, who ironically enough lived his Kyle role when supporting best friend Will Reiser through his cancer ordeal a few years ago. And Reiser even rose up through the challenge and wrote the '50/50' screenplay. Adam's girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) does her best (or better her worst) to support Adam through the ordeal. Adam does get mental aide from a perky newbie psychiatrist Katherine played by Anna Kendrick. Adam also receives some 'I am there with you' support from a couple of older cancer patients Alan (Phillip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Brewer) who share chemistry and chemotherapy with Adam. The legendary Angelica Houston portrays Adam's overbearing but loving mother Diane. What makes '50/50' primarily work as a medication for narrative dullness are the eccentric characters in the film, and Reiser's witty screenplay in authentically balancing out the gravity of the situation with respectful comedic doses. All of the performances get a first-rate diagnosis especially the under-appreciated Gordon-Levitt and the alluring Kendrick; I was psyched up mentally and physically in their scenes together. Rogen was his usual 'rogenish' but was the film's primary comic relief. And I could live to forever to watch Phillip Baker Hall performances. I am glad that Director Jonathan Levine stayed alive with the '50/50' project because the director usually has more than 50% accountability on a movie's success or failure; and in this case it was more of the former than the latter. '50/50' is a movie I could view more than 50 times, and the percentage shows that you will second that notion. I hope there is more than a 50/50 chance you will see this gem as soon as possible. ***** Excellent",Null,2,4,7 October 2011
Deadpool," Deadcool!
","'Deadpool' is a unique superhero film with a unique superhero. Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson, the former quarterback of the Minnesota Vikings; oops, wrong Wade Wilson. OK, he is really the father of that volleyball and BFF of Tom Hanks in 'Castaway'. OK, enough!!!! Reynolds' character Wilson is a fast-talking mercenary who discovers has late stage cancer. Wilson then takes an opportunity from an underground group that promises him that they can cure his cancer and give him superpowers. I know that most of America, and the World for that matter, has seen this movie; but in order not to be in the spoilerpool , I will not divulge more on the plot. I do have to tell you that because of Wilson's dilemma, arises Deadpool. Writers Rhett Reese and Pauk Wernick did go into their pool of witty zingers to deliver to Deadpool's witty verbal attack. Director Tim Miller did pull through with some nicely orchestrated sequences, but at times did get trapped into the formulaic 'bang bang' superhero scenic action. Reynolds was the superhero of 'Deadpool'; his performance was superb. So if you haven't already, take a dip in the 'Deadpool'. **** Good",8,2,6,2 January 2017
The Replacements," Replacements Scores High!
","Have you been `holding' on to see a good sports movie? Because you know that some of the latest ones have `interfered' with all the rules on what a good movie is supposed to be like. I do have to tell you that we have just `received' a pretty good one. That would be `The Replacements.' It `centers' on a bunch of replacement football players. It is a simple movie, but don't be `off-guard' by that because the movie is very entertaining. It stars Keanu Reeves as the scab quarterback and Gene Hackman as the motivating coach. However, what `sweeped' me to my feet was the comedic performances of some of the supporting players such as Jon Favreau and Rhys Ifans.  Their performances were of `first-string' caliber. So get your those loose `nickels' and `dimes' and `runback' to your local movie theatre: so you could sit your `tight end' down and watch this fun football flick.

Get Him to the Greek," Greek is not the word! Even though at times it was diddy good.
","The sidesplitting and sharp comedy 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' is one flick I have not forgotten about. So I was all psyched on seeing 'Get Him to the Greek' which is from the same director behind the Marshall plan; that being Nicholas Stoller. Well unfortunately it looks like Stoller has stolen 109 minutes from my existence, because 'Get Him to the Greek' was an enormous disappointment. The Greek film stars Russell Brand as Aldous Snow of the band Infant Sorrow, who would be the same uproarious rock star character he played in a supporting role in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. Also in the Greek starring show is Marshall alumni Jonah Hill portraying Aaron Green, a record company assistant who is given the challenging task of accompanying (or more like babysitting) the out-of-control Snow from London to Los Angeles' Greek Theater for a scheduled Infant Sorrow comeback concert. Ruckus follows consistently as a neurotic Aaron does his best to control the alcohol & drug induced Snow on the ride from London (with pit stops in New York & Las Vegas) to the Greek, but to no avail. Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs co-stars as the demanding record executive Sergio Roma who delegated the 'snowjob' to Green. Rose Byrne plays Jackie Q., Snow's sexy pop star ex-girlfriend who shares a child with Snow, but now is Entering Sandman every night by mating with Lars Ulrich of Metallica. Elisabeth Moss also co-stars as Daphne, Green's longtime girlfriend who is more on the Daphne Duck side in the looks department. The movie does contain some gross-out comical scenes that provide a few chuckles but they wear out their welcome already during the film's second act. Brand was a riot in 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' but his branded 'highwire' rock star personification is not fit to lead a film. Hill's tiresome bit as the starstruck but determined assistant Green also started growing weary early in getting to the Greek. However, I do not fault Brand and Hill completely. They both got a raw deal by Stoller getting them a muddled & disconnected screenplay. The one thing that really rocked in 'Get Him to the Greek' was the scene-stealing performance from Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs as the self-centered but charismatic Roma. The movie worked when it was in Roma. To say that 'Get Him to the Greek' is a forgettable movie is definitely not part of Greek Mythology, it is a fact! What a Greek tragedy! *** Average",6,1,9,5 June 2010

Easy A," Take it, Easy!!
","Emma Stone continues rolling as a surefire outstanding actress with her vastly charismatic role as high school teen Olive in the gem flick 'Easy A'. Olive is the prototype perky, witty high school teen. Olive is a teen so she is entitled to make mistakes, and hers was lying to her best friend Rhiannon that she slept with a college boy. Olive spills the beans to Rhiannon in the high school female's potty room where the obnoxious, religious zealot Marianne is also at unknowingly to Olive and Rhiannon. Therefore, Marianne turns the gossip overdrive into high gear and before you could say 'I want some of that Olive Oil all over my body', the entire student body thinks that Olive is a certifiable slut. There is more that transpires in 'Easy A' than what was just explained or else it would have been an 'Easy D'. Particularly, the parts that Olive becomes a charity poster girl by helping out the geek and gay males of the school by pretending to sleep with them, so their bullying victimizations come to a cease fire. 'Easy A' is a modern-day adaptation (high school style) to Nathaniel Hawthorne's literary classic 'The Scarlet Letter'. It was just our luck that Director Will Gluck did a phenomenal job in keeping the movie entertaining and engaging at all times. I especially loved how Gluck incorporated the 80's teen flicks homage into the narrative. That was pretty to think, and you could say anything about 80's movies, but don't you forget about how those 80's teen flicks made such a difference in the history of teen cinema. I was also royally impressed with Screenwriter Bert Royal's pretty nifty 'Easy A' scribe; it was filled with zappy one-liners! The supporting ensemble of 'Easy A' sure did aid to the film's success. The greats Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson were (how do you say it?) great as Olive's modern parents Dill & Rosemary. Tucci probably had the funniest lines of the film, and nailed each one of them. The very much underutilized Thomas Haden Church was steady as the cool teacher Mr. Griffiths. Lisa Kudrow guided herself quite effectively in her role as the guidance counselor with a secret, Mrs. Griffiths; and yes, relation to Mr. Griffiths. And also the young gossip guns of 'Easy A' also held their own with their solid performances- Amanda Bynes as Marianne, Penn Badgley as Woodchuck Todd (Olive's crush), and Alyson Mychalka as Rhiannon. But the spotlight of 'Easy A' has to be the marvel of Emma Stone. She not only made the grade, but just moved up the thespian scholarship ranks as one of the best young actresses working in movies today. 'Easy A' deserves an easy A, its one of the best movies I have seen in the last two decades about the lives of high school students.

","Adam Sandler is an established comedy superstar who is a four-leaf clover for producers & directors who cast him in their films. Most of the films Sandler stars in are box office hits including his latest remote- control nutty narrative 'Click'. Sandler stars as Michael Newman, a yuppie architect who is dissatisfied with some aspects of his life. Newman becomes a 'newman' when he meets Morty. He is the quirky Bed Bath & Beyond technician, played by Christopher Walken, who hands Michael a special remote control that gives Michael the enchanted power to control his life. The concept is alluring & witty, but unfortunately 'Click' did not entirely click with me. I will let the remote control features elaborate: 'Play'- I did want to 'play' with the luscious Kate Beckinsale who plays Newman's wife Donna. Not her supreme acting effort but who cares. Hey! You can't have your Kate and act it good too.'Pause'- The sequence when Michael first discovers the miraculous workings of the control were amusing and worthy of a 'pause' to digest the laughs.'Rewind'- I was hoping the theatre projectionist would 'rewind' the film to its first half when I encountered countless unnecessary moral plot elements during the second half of the film. 'Click' would have clicked efficiently as just a side-splitting show instead of a life-lesson lecture.'Fast Forward'- I was hoping the theatre projectionist would 'fast forward' the film every time I saw the hackneyed pet jokes that smothers many comedies. I guess it's my pet peeve in comedies.'Tracking'- Director Frank Coraci was on the right 'track' during the first half of 'Click' , but somehow got derailed and ended up showing us a fuzzy picture.'Stop'- Do not 'stop' what you are doing and feverously see 'Click' but at the same time let me not stop you from a watching a moderately entertaining film. However, it would not kill you to stop it during its midpoint.*** Average",7,1,3,5 September 2006
Pineapple Express," A sour Pineapple taste! Yuck!!!
","A 'Pineapple Express' movie a day, keeps the viewers away! And that is an understatement on how atrocious and rotten this Pineapple tasted to my movie appetite. 'Pineapple Express' is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen. I am sorry producer king Judd Apatow, but your comedy streak express has come to a halt. Apatow has produced, written, and directed a core of elite comedies in the last few years including: 'Knocked Up', 'Step Brothers', 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall', 'Superbad', 'I Love You, Man' and even the overrated but adequate 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'. But Apatow has manufactured his first cinematic monstrosity. 'Pineapple Express' is a foolish & disintegrated film about two stoner dudes who get in a high heap of trouble when one of them witnesses a murder. Seth Rogen plays Dale Denton. Dale is a court-process clerk who buys drugs from drug dealer Saul Silver played by James Franco. Dale is cerebrally dormant, profoundly egotistical, and conclusively annoying. Dale is close to his 30's and has a high school girlfriend, which makes him an even creepier character. Saul is your archetypical, lethargic illegal pharmaceutical rep (yea, you got it!) who does constant product testing to most of the hash he sells; if you get my drift. Dale is definitely in the list of Saul's preferred customers. In a token of appreciation, Saul lets Dale smoke & keep his most unique and valued possession: the Pineapple Express hashish. In one of his court-process 'you've been served' trips, Dale witnesses a murder. The killers are drug dealing kingpin Ted Jones badly played by Gary Cole and corrupt police officer Carol badly played by Rosie Perez. Ted & Carol witness that Dale witnessed the crime. Dale drops his Pineapple doobie after freaking out cause of the shooting and Ted's puff of the Pineapple leads the trail to Saul. The Doobie Brothers themselves, Saul and Dale, consequently go on the run to evade Ted's hit men crew. Saul and Dale hook up with an even more ridiculous character, drug dealer Red. Danny McBride's performance as Red should have been caught red-handed as an exercise in acting futility. The rest of the film is high on despicable irrelevant gore and burned-out marijuana expositions/references. Director David Gordon Green, who is a master of the art house independent film, must have either been offered lots of green to direct the movie or smoked lots of green in directing the movie. Either way, I hope the very talented Mr. Green does not go into this wasted movie Greenland again. Rogen co-wrote the script with longtime collaborator & best buddy Evan Goldberg. They also collaborated for the 'Superbad' screenplay which was super good, but the 'Pineapple Express' was ¬Ö¬Ö (Doy! Fill in the blanks! What do you think I was going to say?) I am still gagging! And I am still mind boggled how James Franco was in the company of the Golden Globe Awards' Best Actor (Comedy/Musical) nominees; to be frank with you, any amateur actor could have played his stoner drug dealer role. And let me not get started on Rogen! Seth, what happened? Not very Sethy here buddy! There is no need to travel on the 'Pineapple Express' through your cinematic journeys. Take the highway home and stay away!!!! Now!!!!!!!! * Failure",3,2,6,9 May 2009
Inside Llewyn Davis," Coenheads disappoint here a bit, but Mr. Isaac is where is at!
","As I went 'Inside Llewyn Davis' (please please please, don't take that the wrong way) I discovered I was watching a mediocre film that was a bit overrated by the film critic industry. But Inside Joel 'Meeza' Mesa there is a disturbed pun cerebral cortex that causes Mr. Mesa to actually think he is part of the film critic industry; so there you have it. Anyways, this Coen Brothers feature stars Oscar Isaac as Lllewyn Davis; a struggling 60's folk singer who leaches of acquaintances, strangers, and other musicians for places to stay as he tries to make a folking name for himself in the music industry. Llewyn is not a nice guy; he is bitter, abrasive, and narcissistic; but boy does he love pussy. Get your mind out of the gutter, cause the pussy I am referring to is a cat of a couple friend of Llewyn who accidentally gets stuck with him, and he does go beyond the call of duty to safeguard the cat. Joel & Ethan Coen are filmmaking legends, so it's hard to nitpick them; not good to nitpick a Joel anyways. But I don't think their direction and scribe of the picture captivated me, but at the same time it was not a folking bore either. Many say that Oscar Isaac got snubbed of an Oscar nom for his starring role here. I do agree that Isaac was phenomenal, but with such a heavy competitive field in the Best Actor race this last season, I think Oscar was properly snubbed; but Oscar's Oscar time will come, try saying that six times in a row at a fast pace. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake give fair performances as the folk duo singing couple Jane and Jim, or is it Jim and Jane. Llewyn impregnates Jane by folking around too much with her; I guess he was having too much fun with 'Dick and Jane'. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' was not the movie I thought it would be, but as an outsider looking inside to the film critic industry, I still suggest you take a look for yourself. And if you did not like my review, Folk You!! Kidding! Kidding! *** Average",7,0,0,30 March 2014
Sin City," Rourke saves the fate of Sin City
","Forgive me father for I have sinned, I had told people that the film 'Sin City' was going to be one of the most profound realistic films about a society of corruption, egoism, and shame. Father, after I saw the film I found that to be not true. Father, even though those three elements are incorporated in Robert Rodriguez's avant-garde film 'Sin City', it was not flashy or sentiment enough for me to evoke on a crusade to minimize the problems in our society. The film is comprised of three separate stories in the fictional town of Basin City. The first one fixates itself on a thug named Marv who seeks revenge on the murder of a prostitute named Goldie. Father, we should bless actor Mickey Rourke for his mesmerizing work here. Father, to quote Toni Basil 'Mickey you are so fine in this film, you blow my mind, Yea Mickey'. The second narrative fixates on a savor-type named Dwight McCarthy who helps a beaten waitress and ends up in a ruckus by unknowingly killing a cop in a part of Basin City controlled by prostitutes. The slick Clive Owen was sturdy as McCarthy and Rosario Dawson leaves you hooked in her work as the mama hooker Gail. The third Basin City fairy tale fixates on an aging cop named John Hartigan who is falsely charged with child molestation even though what he was trying to do was save a little girl from being raped by a monstrous pedophile. Lucy, the young girl, grows up and before you can say 'albacadabra' transforms into the luscious Jessica Alba. Yes! 'I Love Lucy'. Hartigan eventually follows the 'yellow brick road' and is a Lucysaver again by skirmishing with the pedophile who now is transformed as a horrifying villain named 'The Yellow Bastard'. Bruce Willis successfully plays Hartigan as a Die Hard John McClane archetype character. The film's stories are adapted from famed comic book writer Frank Miller's bizarre comic tales of Basin City. Miller co-directed the film with Rodriguez and, get this non pulp fiction, included Quentin Tarantion as a Guest Director. Father, Rodriguez is a technical innovator and should be commended for his cinematic revelations but somehow I felt bored in 'Sin City'. Maybe I thought that it wasn't Miller Time when I would hear the ridiculous banter of Miller's scribed words from the characters of 'Sin City', or maybe it was that there was not a central message within the mildly connecting narratives , or maybe it was just that I wanted to see the 'raw' version of the infamous Alba dancing on the stage scene. Father, whatever it was forgive me for my marginal critical film review of 'Sin City' . *** Average",7,0,3,4 April 2006
Gangs of New York," Day-Lewis was the master 'gang' leader in this one!
","Director Martin Scorcese's assiduous film dramatizations of New York continue with the 19th century epic 'Gangs of New York'. Leonardo Dicaprio stars as Amsterdam, an Irish immigrant who returns to New York to take vengeance on his father's murderer- Bill the Butcher. Daniel Day-Lewis slices up an electrifying performance as Bill the Butcher. This is a type of role that is 'prime meat' for an Oscar nomination, so expect Day-Lewis to deservedly receive a nod when nominations are announced. However, Dicaprio was no 'King of New York' in his stale performance. Cameron Diaz, who plays the pick-pocket romantic interest, was not able to steal our hearts with her lackadaisical acting attempt. Diaz has definitely had 'better diaz' as an actress.  The voluptuous 'big apples' of 'Gangs of New York' was the detailed direction of Scorcese, the magnificent replication art direction, and the subjective historical cinematography. Also, let's not forget Day-Lewis' outstanding 'meaty' performance. Even though it was not the classic that I expected, 'Gangs of New York' is overpowering enough for you to take your gang to initiate yourselves in the 'Gangs of New York'. **** Good",8,0,0,24 December 2002
Windtalkers," It is a 'Winder' by a Split Decision
","I am going to talk about Director John Woo's war film `Windtalkers', and please do not break my wind. This battle movie is based on the true story of how the Navajo Indians helped Americans with their language for code-breaking in World War 2. Nicolas Cage stars as the marine who is recruited to protect a `family man' Navajo Indian and the code. Nicolas or should we call him `marries with presley' was a bit middling as a war marine. However, I do have to `bow' my head for Chief Cage for broadening his acting horizons by acting in his first war flick. Adam Beach, who plays the Navajo Indian, portrayed his character in a candy-coated tone that tried to hard to convince audiences that he was no `son of a beach'. Some of the formulaic elements of `Windtalkers' were too irksome for me. However, the affectionate manifestation of the appreciation of the Navajo Indians with their masterful language is what made `Windtalkers' one film that you will not stop talking about. **** Good",7,0,1,22 November 2002
Joy," Not a complete joy, but not a downer!
","Acclaimed Writer-Director David O. Russell's playbook was not so golden or silver for that matter in his creation of his latest film 'Joy', but I still think it had enough americana woman hustle and brought a woman fighter to the limelight effectively. 'Joy' stars Jennifer Lawrence as Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop. Her story details the spirit of invention of a young girl which later materialized even further as an adult. Sure, there were a few aspects of 'Joy' that needed some cleaning; including too much emphasis on Joy's dysfunctional family which were very unlikeable. But that did not stop me on feeling joy in observing the title character's fiery determination to succeed. Lawrence was sensational as Joy, and it was no miracle that she was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Bradley Cooper was enigmatic as the cable-access merchandising channel mogul Neil Walker, and his scenes with Lawrence brought back some of that silver lining chemistry between these two; however, I was not sold on the fact that Cooper's performance had to be limited to just a few scenes. I also saw no new inventiveness in the supporting performances of Robert DeNiro as Joy's father, Virgina Madsen as Joy's mother, and Edgar Ramirez as Joy's ex-hubby. Nevertheless, it was the Joy herself, Jennifer Lawrence, that made me buy into it. **** Good",8,2,5,4 March 2016
Her," This 'Her' is worth the date!
","Have you seen 'Her'? Baby have you seen 'Her? AAAAAA! OK, sorry for that Motown intro to my film review of the inventive flick 'Her'. Spike Jonze has written and directed yet another creative narrative. 'Her' stars the masterful Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, a lonely man who is still grieving the separation from his soon to be ex-wife. 'Her' is set in the not-too-distant future where people are even more dependent on technology for their daily interactions. Theodore gets his 'Roosevelt' on (whatever that means) when he falls for his Operating System named Samantha wonderfully voiced by Scarlett Johansson; yes, a non-living breathing 'her'. Jonze brilliantly depicts how the dependence on technology for communication with others has hampered the viability of interpersonal relationships. Could falling for a living breathing organism be a thing of the past? I don't think Jonze takes it to that extreme, but comes remotely close. Wait, I have to take a break. My OS Punantha is talking to me and wants to have lunch, so I have to go now see her. Kidding!! Jonze's cerebral operating system proves again that it is proficient in directing yet another inventive film in 'Her'; and his screenplay was a revelation which also included the most comical scene of the year with that cursing video game character. Phoenix's performance as Theodore did briefly walked the line of over-depressive, but Joaquin did authentically bring it to life. Johansson's vocal performance is the best vocal work I have ever witnessed on screen; frankly my dear Scarlett I do give a damn that you were shut out of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. The talented Amy Adams does some nice genuine work here as Theodore's friend Amy. So even though 'Her' is not for everyone, I still think you should see 'Her' sometime. ***** Excellent",9,0,1,6 February 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Millions will love 'Slumdog Millionaire'
","'Slumdog Millionaire' is rich with so many magnificent qualities: It is a vibrant, inspiring, and audacious film. And it just might be the apex of cinematic releases for the film year 2008. 'Slumdog Millionaire' is the story of impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik's Dickens-like life adventure during his childhood and juvenile years; from his turbulent childhood in India's slums to his destined juvenile experience of being a game show contestant of India's version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' Director Danny Boyle does a divine job of orchestrating on how Jamal is able to answer Millionaire questions correctly by Jamal's adventurous 'lifeline' childhood & youthful slum experiences; the two interrelated juxtaposed narrative structures is the storytelling nature of 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Jamal and his older brother Salim together go through many childhood slum trials & tribulations and evade seizure & mortality in the most unique ways. Salim as he grows older eventually ventures into the bad seed of living a thug life, while genuine Jamal turns the other cheek and is just focused on living a love life. You see Jamal's foremost drive is to reunite with the love of his life Lakita, which he befriended as a child but were separated in a slum escape from some horrific opportunistic criminals. Jamal as a young man does eventually find the beautiful Lakita and is aware that she is an avid fan of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' Therefore, that is what leads our main slumdog Jamal to the game show experience. India's law enforcement is dubious on how a slumdog like Jamal can answers questions correctly on the game show, so they shake up Jamal a bit. Jamal then has no other choice but to tell his life story to them and fortunately for our cinematic delight to us viewers also. Dev Patel as Jamal was no slum in his motion picture acting debut with his brilliant performance. Anil Kapoor was captivating as Millionaire host Prem Kumar; and the steady veteran Indian actor Irrfan Khan did contribute yet another admirable performance to his underrated acting resume. The drop dead gorgeous Freida Pinto not only paints a pretty picture as an Indian sex symbol but she was also ready as Freddy, I mean Freida, with her thespian contribution to Slumdog. Simon Beaufoy's electric screenplay was one of the year's elite and Simon says 'you best believe that it is a lock for a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination.' The wondrous cinematography, production design, and editing of 'Slumdog Millionaire' should also bark up more Oscar nominations on the Slumdoghouse. The celebratory theme song of Slumdog is entitled 'Jai Ho' which means 'Victory' in Indian. The rousing 'Jai Ho' is also worthy of an Oscar jai ho as Best Song. The true hero of 'Slumdog Millionaire' is Director Danny Boyle for his precise composition of this gem of a film; thank you Danny Boy! How do you say 'Best Director Oscar' in Indian? Will there be many Jai Ho's for 'Slumdog Millionaire' come Oscar night? I believe so and that is my final answer! ***** Excellent",10,1,5,13 January 2009
The Nice Guys," More than nice!!!!!!
","Niiiiice job Shane Black for directing and co-scripting with inventive flair the very groovy and immensely entertaining 'The Nice Guys'. The movie is set in the 70's and stars Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as (respectively) hit- for-hire man Jackson Healy and clumsy P.I. Holland March. Circumstances that are uproarious in happenstance lead them to team up to find a missing teen named Amelia, who just might be the key to revealing more not-too-nice foul play situations. Kim Basinger co-stars as Amelia's mother who hires The Nice Guys to find Amelia before she gets lost in the clouds (with all due apologies to the late, great Amelia Earheart for that pun). 'The Nice Guys' will be like no other movie you will see this year; its distinctive quality and magnetic unpredictability are two major reasons this movie is a very nice gem. But of course, other nice gems come in the form of Crowe and Gosling for their super nice performances; Sure the real Crowe has had his real life moments of not being too nice, but who cares, he was very nice here as Healy. And give that Gosling fellow an Oscar nomination for his uproarious performance as March, it's the Ides of March!! Hey, wasn't he in that movie? And hail to Mr. Black for putting all this nice stuff together! It's time for you to play nice and take & have a trip with 'The Nice Guys'. ***** Excellent",10,14,29,21 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," Was mad with disappointment! But loved the cinematography!!!
","Don't get mad with me to the max, but I was not enthralled at all with 'Mad Max:Fury Road'. George Miller's redux of his classic 80's Mad Max franchise was mostly about visual storytelling but there was no true connection with any of the characters, mostly the madman himself Max. If you are not familiar with this franchise, the film takes place in a dystopian future where eccentric characters set the pave to a divided society. Tom Hardy stars as Max, who is about to be killed in some type of mundane 'chain to a speeding truck' kind of deal; when circumstances change, he now joins a group of female rebels led by Imperator Furiosa, profoundly played by Charlize Theron; but not to the caliber of Oscar nominated, don't get furioso with me, just my take. Tom Hardy, who is one of my favorite actors, turns out his worst performance of his career; he looked lost and stale throughout the picture. However, I am still in the Tom Tom Club as a Hardy fan; Hardy har har. Nicholas Hoult was sound as the desperate Nux. Director George Miller's direction was way over the top, and not much could be said of his limited screenplay. Hey, but I did not hate it all together. John Seale's brilliant cinematography got my seal of approval. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' was a road for me that will be less traveled. *** Average",6,1,3,6 September 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Glad I saw the Hacksaw!
","Mel Gibson is not a Mad Phone-to-the-Max anymore; he is back; returning to passion with his harrowing true-story war drama 'Hacksaw Ridge'. The film stars Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss, who was the first American soldier who served in a war without firing a gun. I will try to be the first corny puns critic to write up a review without firing a pun; mmm don't see that happening. Anyways, Doss fought during World War II as a medic during the Battle of Okinawa. His religious beliefs in not killing was the prominent reason why he chose not to be armed, even though he fought hard with the Army for that right, and even almost got court martialed for it. I'm not going to fire away spoilers here, but what Doss did unarmed to save numerous soldiers was an unfathomable act of courage. Gibson's direction of the film was spectacularly vivid. Garfield was a tour- de-force as Doss; and there were also some sure fire supporting performances from Vince Vaughn as Doss' semi- sympathetic Sergeant and Sam Worthington as his defiant Captain. The battle scenes were mesmeric, but it was the more humane scenes of Doss' refusal to carry a firearm that triggered the best part of the film for me. The movie did run a tad too long, but that did not defeat the matter that I am a believer of 'Hacksaw Ridge'. **** Good",Null,0,4,11 February 2017
Gladiator," SWIIIIIIIINGGGGG!
","I am sure glad I decided to go see the new epic film 'Gladiator.' This movie is sure to be a hit with all audiences! Set in the glory days of Rome, the film is about a former commander who is enslaved and must be a gladiator to seek revenge and survive. Could somebody say 'summer blockbuster'? It is not inside confidential information anymore, Russell Crowe is not just a fine actor but now he is a big star. His performance as the gladiator was subtle, but yet, powerful. Co-star Joaquin Phoenix also delivered a swashbuckling performance. However, he still has many rivers to cross before he gets to Crowe's acting status. Follow my advice- Do not save it for later, go see 'Gladiator.' **** Good",8,0,0,6 June 2000

The Social Network," My friends, this is the best movie of 2010!
","Please do not ignore my following movie review of the grand masterpiece 'The Social Network'. Yes, I will confirm that there will be plenty of corny puns 'like' in my other movie reviews; but you don't get to 500 million puns without making a few enemies. 'The Social Network' is Director David Fincher's captivating tale of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's creation of the infamous social network and it has my affirmation as the best movie of the year. Fincher's precise direction first connects with Zuckerberg as a Harvard University student in 2003 when he develops 'Facemash', the 'who is the hotter Harvard gal from the two' site that dismayed many of the Harvard fems, but was a major hit with so many hits on campus. Zuckerberg got facemashed out of angst of being dumped by his girlfriend one Fall evening in 2003. 'Facemash' also proved that Zuckerberg had no problems hacking away in the Harvard network. Facemash was the genesis of what turned out to be the social networking book of all, Facebook. Zuckerberg partnered with his only friend on campus, economics major Eduardo Saverin, to develop Facebook- a social network website where¬Ö (you know what it is! Hello!) The rest of 'The Social Network' logs on to the rise of Facebook, and the legal depositions that sucked in Zuckerberg by those who claimed that the Facebook idea was theirs; including the Harvard rowers Winklevoss twins and their diva pal Divya Narendra, and even Saverin himself takes a swing at Zuckerberg in this Boston Sue Party. The opportunistic Napster founder Sean Parker also gets in the picture not as an angry plaintiff towards Zuckerberg, but as one that makes his mark on Mark by seizing opportunities to put Facebook on the profit map. If you are still reading this and are not a napster falling asleep on me, Facebook me! God Bless you for putting up with the puns. Speaking of which, I am running out of puns so its time to hit the Punbook. OK, I am back on 'The Social Network' serious (sort of speak) review state. Aaron Sorkin's screenplay of the movie is an ingenious film libretto that delivers in not only characterization but also in authenticity of today's social taxonomy in and out of the net. Moreover, Sorkin's script highlights the thin line between friendship and ownership. Sorkin is in for a Best Screenplay Oscar nom. Director David Fincher takes Sorkin's words into the vision of the narrative that makes it a tour-de-force triumph that will also place Oscar nomination status for King David. The thespian network of 'The Social Network' were not lagging on to mediocrity, they were exemplary. Andrew Garfield was terrific as the gullible Saverin; Armie Hammer & Josh Pence sure hammered it down in playing both Winklevoss twins in two parts, head and body; Rooney Mara was all marvel & bright as Mark's ex-girlfriend Erica Albright; Justin Timberlake was bringing his fine acting back by delightfully loading down another commendable performance in portraying Sean Parker; and Rashida Jones's work as legal assistant Marilyn Delpy was all legally not-wrong in my book. But it was Jesse's world! Jesse Eisenberg's starring performance as Mark Zuckerberg is by far one that should be posted by the Academy as the one to beat in the Best Actor Oscar race. Eisenberg portrayed Zuckerberg with such an authentic multilayered mode that its thespian algorithms formulated Jesse in the elite club of today's best young actors. There is a lot more to 'like' of 'The Social Network' that could be depicted in my review. But it seems that I have received a request to end my review, which I will do. 'The Social Network' is a cinematic magnum opus that will connect to many members of the movie-going industry and many members of the movie award industry. It is the movie event of the year that should be attended by all! ***** Excellent",10,1,5,7 October 2010
The Pursuit of Happyness," Willpower at its apex!
","Will Smith's pursuit of an Oscar might be accomplished for his stellar & heartbreaking work in the sappy, but then again feel-good, flick 'The Pursuit of Happiness'. The film chronicles the true story of Chris Gardner, an economic-struggling medical equipment salesman in the 70's who eventually becomes homeless and has to solely care for his young son Christopher. However, this constant persevering Gardner obtains an unpaid internship at a Dean Witter brokerage firm in his pursuit of his happy dream job as a stockbroker. The film's focus on the kinship between father & son through turbulent times was conducted with the right notating heartstrings. Kudos goes out to Screenwriter Steve Conrad for playing the right heartstring scribal tunes. Will's real son Jaden Smith plays Kid Christopher. Mr. & Mr. Smith pull it off to proclaim their work as the best father & son acting duo performance in cinema history. 'The Pursuit of Happiness' did get off the 'film happy route' with a few irrelevant scenes. However, this endearing narrative is one worth smiling about! So 'C'Mon Get Happy' and pursue yourself to view 'The Pursuit of Happiness'. **** Good",8,1,1,9 January 2007
The Proposal," A mixed Proposal of cinematic engagement and disengagement
","Oh, my love. You are the most beautiful and caring woman in this universe. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Saying that (bending on one knee presenting an engagement ring) Would you marry me? Oops! Wrong Proposal written material! That is the one I used in my real-life Proposal pop to my wife. The one intended here is for the romantic comedy 'The Proposal'. Sandra Bullock stars as Margaret Tate, a domineering publisher executive who is threatened to be deported from the U.S. because of past illegal immigration business traveling. Margaret is Canadian. Ryan Reynolds co-stars as Andrew Paxton, Margaret's restless assistant who dreams of proposing himself to move up the publishing hierarchy to Editor. In a desperate & improvisational move to convince her bosses to let her stay employed and avoid deportation, Margaret pretends that she is engaged to Andrew. He is obviously oblivion to this firsthand but quickly sees Margaret's selfish motives. Margaret & Andrew travel to Alaska to visit Andrew's family for his grandmother's 90th Birthday, and consequently so Marg can learn more about Andrew & his Paxton family tree so she can ace the dreadful Immigration interrogation of marriage authenticity. Did Andrew and Margaret get at each other's throat in Alaska? Or do they fall for each other throughout this crazy ordeal? Does his family suspect the farce of it all? Does his grandmother survive? Does Margaret get to keep her job? Does she get deported? Am I asking way too many questions in this review? OK, I will stop! It is just that I am in this 'popping the question' mode while scribing this Proposal review. One question I would definitely say 'No' to is: If Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds had screen chemistry? Not to take away from their quasi-commendable performances, I just do not see Sandra being Ryan's hope as a compatible acting partner. And visa-versa for Sandra with Ryan, and that is no bullock! Betty White did have some golden scene-stealing efforts as Grandma Annie, but I would not give it a 'grandmother clause' recognition because we have seen these shades of White numerous times before with her recent film characters in playing the loony geriatric. Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen looked bored portraying Andrew's parents. And Oscar Nunez playing the Latin zany 'do-it-all' named Ramone became a running joke that became way too outlandish & creepy and disbarred credibility from his performance; even though there were some 'guilty pleasure' smirks along the Ramone way. Screenwriter Pete Chiarelli should have proposed to write up a wittier and less formulaic screenplay than the one he offered for the film. Director Anne Fletcher tried to engage the audience with inventive comedic scenes, but not enough to accept her working of 'The Proposal' as viably original. I do not think you should totally reject 'The Proposal' but give it some time to think about it, and wait to rent it during its DVD release. End of Proposal! *** Average",7,0,8,21 June 2009
Shark Tale," Sharkpun Heaven!
","The Pixar computer animated classic 'Finding Nemo' found itself a pool of box office euphoria. Since 'Finding Nemo' were 'the fisher kings' of the box office last year, Dreamworks decided to go fishing for some of their own dough and develop their own fishy animated story. I introduce you 'Shark Tale'. Audiences also took the bait on 'Shark Tale' by rounding up satisfactory box office coin. However, it did not reach the deep sea pockets of Nemo. 'Shark Tale' stars Lenny the tiburon (voiced by Jack Black) as a gentle sharkey lacking the fury of his fellow sharkanians. In other words, he is no sharkey's machine! I guess Lenny does not fit in the school of sharks. The situation does not 'boat' I mean bode well with Don Lino, Lenny's shark daddy (voiced by Robert Deniro). Don Lino wishes Lenny was a bone shark instead of a lone shark. Next, I introduce Oscar the hyper bling-bling fish (voiced by Will Smith). Even though Smith will not receive any Oscar nominations for his voice-over of Oscar, it is still deserving of a goldfish statuette instead of the aforementioned goldman statuette. Oscar is chatty, manipulative, and debonaire. Angie the pescada (voiced by Renee Zellweger) is in love with the big 'O' and would give her left gill for him. She wants to have Oscar at below! Then we come to Lisa (voiced by Angelina Jolie) who is the fish girl interrupted who is trying to prevent from Oscar & Angie from hooking up. However, Lisa wants Oscar for his bills and not for his gills. Through some unforeseen circumstances, Oscar is recognized as 'the shark slayer' because of Lenny's generous antics. Shark Tale's relentless puns was the prominent feature why you should deep into 'Shark Tale' at your own risk! **** Good",8,2,6,31 December 2004
Hustle & Flow," Do the Hustle and Flow!
","You know it's hard out there for an anglo film director to orchestrate a film focusing on the dreams of a struggling pimp's thrive in becoming a successful rap artist. However, Director Craig Brewer was able to accomplish it with a superfluous flow. You know it's hard out there for an actor to dig deep into the protagonist role of DJ, the aforementioned pimp who's relentless pursuit of self-accomplishment is the thrust of his life. However, Terrence Howard's star-making performance saved this DJ from a broken acting heart. Terrence's titillating work is probably the most passionate acting performance of the year! You know it's hard out there for supporting actors to compete with Howard's extravaganza thespian effort; but Anthony Anderson, Taryn Manning, D.J. Qualls, Paula Jai Parker, Taraji P. Henson, and Ludicrous go with the flow admirably and do the supporting acting hustle impressively. You know it's hard out there for a rap song in a movie to win the Best Song Academy Award. However, 3 Six Mafia put a hit to that myth by deservingly getting the aforementioned golden boy recognition for the hit single 'You Know It's Hard Out There For A Pimp'. 'Hustle & Flow' was engrossing, spirited, and succulent. So get some flow and do the 'Hustle & Flow'. *****Excellent",9,0,1,29 March 2006
Cinderella Man," Braddock High!
","I had a pugilistic ball watching 'Cinderella Man'. Director Ron Howard's bio of Great Depression boxer Jim Braddock is the most inspiring film of the year. Russell Crowe was a knockout as Braddock. Do not get so hung up on Crowe's real life phone banging ordeal. His uppercut performance as Braddock was of the heavyweight thespian class. Braddock was an upstart boxer of the late 20's when his fate turned for the worse and was heavily affected by the Great Depression of the 30's. He started losing fights, losing money, and close to even losing life. However, he had the tenacious courage to comeback and re-energize his boxing career and eventually became a champion pugilist! It is a real Cinderella story! Renee Zelweger plays his devoted wife Mae. Mae I say that I was impressed by Renee's performance here. Paul Giamatti diverse acting training came in handy with his hands-on charismatic performance as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould. Giamatti keeps proving that he is as good as 'Gould' with each acting project he undertakes. Howard masterfully directed the film and was a technical artist with the exceptional champion boxing scenes. Probably the supreme boxing scenes in movie history! Sly Stallone and Martin Scorsese probably want to punch me out by that last comment. So before the clock strikes twelve, make all your boxing film dreams come true and visit the true fairy tale of 'Cinderella Man'. ***** Excellent",9,0,0,4 April 2006
Valkyrie," I am 'germaine' like many others in thinking this is just an average movie!
","VALKYRIE(In the style of Steve Winwood 80's hit song 'Valkyrie')So wild, leading there, with his hands going in for the dare I cannot remember if von Stauffenberg actually touched him There is still no other face dreaded in Germany's face Not cool, he was an ass in Germany's days Hitler, fright and not sweet, that Von Stauffenberg wanted to blow away Now he cannot be that warm, with Von Stauffenberg's bomb ready to disarmValkyrie, kill on him, kill on him, Valkyrie Come and see, He is not the same Colonel he used to beOK, enough! Director Bryan Singer's 'Valkyrie' is not more than a modest adaptation of true story events on German Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's assassination attempt of Adolph Hitler during the height of World War II. Operation Valkyrie, is the name of the plan that used the Reserve Army to keep amongst the Germany country should anything disrupt communications from Hitler, or should Hitler be killed. It should have been titled 'Fuehrerkillrye'. Colonel Santa Claus did have some elf helpers (I mean other German conspirers) in his 'Bye Hitler' assassination attempt including: General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy), Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp), and other general German Hitler Haters. Singer orchestrates the 'Kill Hitler' tune synchronic at times; but at others, it was lost in key with its complex 'hard-to-follow' plot. Tom Cruise's starring performance as von Stauffenberg was commandable, I mean commendable, but misfired at times with its monotonous expressions. The supporting acting performances from Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Izzard, Tom Wilkinson, and the aforementioned Nighy & Stamp also failed to kill me with thespian excellence, even though I am giving these acclaimed actors the benefit of the doubt because they were given such a convoluted script. Not to say that Christopher McQuarrie's script wasn't sporadically engaging, but most times it was blown right over my head and also of most general moviegoers. Do not fully kill your plans on watching 'Valkyrie', but do not accept a hit Hitler killer movie! *** Average",7,0,0,20 September 2009
Draft Day," Good Draft!
","I would not select 'Draft Day' as the best movie of 2014, especially of what is still available on the cinematic board that we still have to see. Nonetheless, Director Ivan Reitman's sports flick is still worth scouting. Kevin Costner stars as Sonny Weaver Jr., the NFL Cleveland Browns General Manager, who must make some crucial decisions on the team's draft. The film follows Weaver as he weaves himself into a wide array of conflicts & dilemmas during an entire draft day that include not only NFL draft personnel decisions, but also personal agendas of his much younger pregnant girlfriend Ali (who also happens to be the team's CFO) and conflicts with his overbearing mother Barb. Jennifer Garner and Ellen Burstyn did not really score too many thespian points with their mediocre performances as Ali & Barb. However, I would not trade Costner's impressive performance as Weaver for nothing. On paper, the film is not a brilliant piece of filmmaking; which the same could be said of NFL Draft prospects. But if you are a NFL fan, you will touch down and relate to all the football jargon, dealings, and excitement. Oh one extra point before I leave, if you are a Fantasy Football fanatic (present company included), you will even like 'Draft Day' a bit more. I think you should feel a draft coming in, and don't turn over away from 'Draft Day' **** Good",8,2,3,16 November 2014
The Soloist," A bit of a downer, but then there is Downey! Hooray!
","I will not isolate the 'The Soloist' as the supreme film of 2009; but I do think it does harmonize itself into a profound film on friendship, homelessness, and schizophrenia. 'The Soloist' is based on a true story of a Los Angeles Times journalist Steve Lopez who befriends homeless musician Nathaniel Ayers in the city of angels. To this day, they still remain close and because of mutual respect they call each other by Mister. And I will do the same; I will refer to them as Mr. throughout my review. And also, the 80's band Mr. Mister will provide the soundtrack of my 'The Soloist' film review! Kidding! Come back! Don't do a solo on me! I will bring you back to the story! Mr. Lopez met Mr. Ayers in 2005 in one of Mr. Lopez's solo journalistic city escapades in trying to figure his next story for the paper. Mr. Lopez saw Mr. Ayers with his homeless attire and shopping kart playing a mean violin. Then Mr. Lopez's writing light bulbs sparkled and before you know it: Viola! 'Homeless Violin Player' came to the Mr. Lopez cerebral cortex as an idea for his next story. Mr. Lopez did investigate Mr. Ayer's background and learned that Mr. Ayers was a musically gifted Julliard student in the early 70's who majored in Celloism, sort of speak. He also learned that Mr. Ayers ended up dropping out of Julliard because of his schizophrenia condition. Mr. Lopez initially does have soloist ulterior motives in his friendship with Mr. Ayers, but then genuine emotions towards Mr. Ayers do get the better of Mr. Lopez as he grows closer to Mr. Ayers. OK, I think I am putting a little bit too much 'misterd' on this hot dog review of 'The Soloist', so I will give the Mister thing a rest! Director Joe Wright does an admirable effort in displaying the atrocities of homeless life in urban Los Angeles, and how the power of friendship can be the homeless' biggest ally to get out of the mental gutter. But Wright's left hand woman in 'The Soloist' Writer Susannah Grant did not give the Wright word to back him up. Her discomforting, uneven screenplay of 'The Soloist' was a bit off-key. Robert Downey Jr. does not let us down once more with his startling performance as Lopez. Jamie Foxx's thespian symphony was a tragic but weighty one in his heartbreaking portrayal of Ayers; his schizophrenic self-mumbles were quite remarkable. But my Oscar bets are more down with Downey Jr. for the solo Best Actor nomination from the film. The last act of my film review concerto of 'The Soloist' orchestrates in summary that this film should not be left alone, and needs your movie-goer company. If for no better reason, 2 and a ¬Ω words‚ÄîRobert Downey Jr.!!!!!!!!!! **** Good",8,1,2,1 May 2009
Dodgeball," A Ballistic Classic!
","It took some balls to develop a film based on the sport of Dodgeball! How can a movie based on an endangered sport entice moviegoers? Well, the formula worked! 'Dodgeball: The True Underdog Story' was a box office underdog hit! The film was hilarious! Vince Vaughn stars as Peter LeFleur, an Average Joe gym owner who is struggling to keep his what-else but 'Average Joe' gym open for business. Moreover, 'Average Joe's' reality show comes into play when White Goodwin, the competitive successful owner of Globo's Gym, threatens to buy out the Average Joe Gym for it to be utilized as a parking garage for Globos. Peter LeFleur must come up with $50k in less than a month to avoid the buyout. For Pete's sake, Why do 'Average Joels' I mean 'Average Joes' finish last! Ben Stiller as White Godwin was an undeniable laugh riot! His White Lies make him out to be a womanizing entrepreneur when in fact he is a self-absorbed insecure rat. However, his self-absorption creates a comical fixation to us viewers for the Globo master who's bubble has burst! Stiller continues to instill laughter in movies with the best of them. Back to Peter! In order to come up with the $50k cashola, Peter and his Average Joe entourage gym members decide to enter a Dodgeball contest in Las Vegas. The problem is that the only thing these guys have ever dodged in their lives are punches from the bullies who have harassed them their entire lives. Justin Long, Stephen Root, Joel Moore, Chris Williams, and Vaughn himself executed better than average performances as the Average Joes! Rip Torn was also mesmerizing as Patches O' Houlihan, an old-timer Dodgeball legend who coaches the Joes. Christine Taylor, Stiller's real life wife, was watching as Kate Veatch; the lawyer representing Goodwin who decides to become an Average Joe dodgeballer herself. 'Dodgeball: The True Underdog Story' is the funniest film I saw in 2004! Hats off to Writer-Director Rawson Marshall Thurber! His marshall comedic plan was filled with raw laughs! It's a doggoned or should I say underdog classic! ***** EXCELLENT",10,1,2,24 June 2005
Rock Star," It rocked but not completely rolled
","`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest.  If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. However, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of Jennifer Aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. I could not say the same about the rock star himself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star.   I did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes. It reminded me of my teenage years where everything `smelled like teen spirit'. I guess the film is worth a viewing, but for you to have a better time watching it make sure you bring along some `girls, girls, girls.' *** Average",7,0,2,24 March 2002
The Martian," Close to marsvelous!
","Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' is pretty much a marginally great movie, but I would rather insert it in the 'marginally really good movie' category. This sci-fi light comedy focuses on astronaut Mark Watney. Poor Mark was left for dead in Mars by his fellow astronaut crew members when a mission to Mars had an accidental explosion. However, NASA eventually found a mark that revealed that Mark is really alive, and now their challenger, I mean challenging mission is to bring Mark back safely. A good chunk of 'The Martian' resembles the 'Castaway' makeup: a man stranded alone and fighting for not just physical survival but psychological survival; differences: one is an island, and the other one is in a planet, and also one talks to a volleyball named Wilson, and the other one talks to a video screen named... wait Mark did not give the video screen a name, maybe he should have called it Screenie. Anyways, Scott's directorial vision is out-of- this-world and is deservant of Best Director nomination love; it really moved me how he was able to incorporate disco music in a sci-fi flick. Drew Goddard's screenplay worked on the comedic fare, but lost me a bit with the way-too-much scientific technical verbose. Matt Damon was excellent as Watney. The supporting acting was also not spaced-out in acting proficiency; which included outstanding work from Jessica Chastain, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Kate Mara, Michael Pe√±a, and Sean Bean. You Should Be Dancing, I mean seeing 'The Martian'; there is some really cool hot (yes, I am disco oxymoron)stuff for you to discover. **** Good",8,3,6,13 December 2015
The Fighter," 'The Fighter' is a winner!
","Ladies and gentlemen! It could very well be the main movie event of 2010! Weighing in at 114 minutes, packed with solid acting performances, and destined to be one of the best boxing character pictures of all time, 'The Fiiiiiighter'! Star and Executive Producer Mark Wahlberg bent over backwards for many years to get 'The Fighter' in the cinematic ring. It was a project that was destined to be knocked out in developmental hell. Wahlberg took the hits but fought enough to get the film greenlighted, and then asked his good friend & collaborator David O. Russell to direct 'The Fighter'. Why not? Russell has been known to fight from time to time with his actors, just ask the legendary Lily Tomlin; the 'David vs. Actor Goliaths' approach could have just been utilized when Wahlberg was able to recruit the feisty but outstanding actor Christian Bale to the project. 'The Fighter' depicts the true story of Massachusetts boxer Mickey Ward, the Welterweight who in the mid-90's ¬Ö. I can't finish out that statement or else it will be a blow to your cinematic pleasure of enjoying 'The Fighter'. Ward was trained by his older half-brother Dicky Eklund, a former fighter himself who in 1978 knocked out Sugar Ray Leonard but then was knocked out himself by Sugar Crack Burner. Yea, he became a crack addict. Ward was managed by his controlling mother Alice, whose 'Alice in Fighterland' management style are reminiscent of the Mommie Dearest uppercuts; OK, maybe not that bad but she vehemently insists for Mickey to be managed and trained by her circle of family & friends. One thing about Alice is that she was in Laborland plenty of times in her life by not only birthing Mickey & Dicky, but also six other sisters! Mickey falls for sexy bartender Charlene Fleming, who supports Mickey in his boxing career but feels it would be of benefit to him not to include his crack addict brother and his possessive mother in his entourage. Director David O. Russell and Screenwriters Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy, and Eric Johnson effectively prioritize character development within this prized picture and just let boxing and its circle be the arena where the film's characters are exhibited in their highs & lows; either mentally, physically, or psychologically. In other words, 'The Fighter' is more a character piece than a 'win at all cost' hoorah boxing flick. Mark Wahlberg did not lack a punch with his well-balanced starring performance as Mickey Ward. Amy Adams tended the acting task quite admirably once more with her juicy performance as Charlene. Melissa Leo had the mother of all supporting actress performances of the year with her magnetic performance as momma manager Alice. But the ringleader of all the acting here was undoubtedly the stupendous work of the caped crusader himself Christian Bale. He totally embodied the character of Dicky Englund. Bale has been doing this for years in fully transforming himself to the characters he portrays. You don't believe me? Add to your Netflix Query 'American Psycho', 'The Machinist', and '3:10 To Yuma', if you have not seen these Bale classic performances already. All of these performances (especially Psycho) should have been nominated for Best Actor Oscars! I will give the Academy the benefit of the doubt there because of strong competition in those years, but I will not bail them out this year if Bale is not championed as the Best Supporting Actor. 'The Fighter' may not come out on top as the best motion picture of the year, but it is still one viable worthy contender. ***** Excellent",9,3,5,20 December 2010

Up in the Air," Air Reitman scores high!
","I will try to downsize this review of a downsize flick in less than 500 words. I am up for that even though I probably will not be able to pilot that task. Writer-Director Jason Reitman's 'Up In The Air' is already airing it out as probably the best reviewed film of the year. Hope Reitman still stays grounded with all the Award accolades he will be receiving very soon. I am sure he will; because of his humbleness and mindset is one of the main reasons why 'Up In The Air' is extrairdonaire! George Clooney stars in 'Up In The Air' as a certified airhead who is always daydreaming throughout his day. Kidding! OK, to pilot this plot properly: Clooney stars as Ryan Bingham, a corporate downsizer who spends most of his time traveling from city to city firing away downsizing bullets by informing employees of corporations that 'their services will no longer be needed'. Bingham has an innate talent in his corporate executions in a way that it does not demean the employee, even through all the grief & anger they go through when they hear the news. Bingham does not seek comfort in completing such a task, but that is what he specializes in. He does seek comfort in living the solitary jet-set life of business travel. He also obsesses on obtaining an ultimate frequent-flyer mileage zenith goal, not for the perks but for the experience. Bingham's 'one man is an island' life has left him still single at middle-aged with no children, but Mr. Bing would not have it any other way. Not to say he is shy and reserved, because he does possess the gift of gab. Example: On occasion, he is hired as an independent contractor to conduct 'What is in my backpack?' presentations in business seminars on prioritizing what & who is important in one's life. Other Example: He also does air out the lothario muela by meeting and bedding beautiful & intelligent women during his city stops; which by the way this is a good segue to introduce the character of Alex to all of you. Alex becomes 'Ryan's Hope' of meeting the female version of him. She shares many of the same qualities & preferences as Ryan and also strives on living a corporate traveler lifestyle. Their connecting banter at the hotel bar where they first meet is of screenplay supremacy. Let me now stopover to Natalie. No, she is not another Bingham bang. Natalie is a novice employee of the Omaha 'downsizing services' corporation where Ryan works. She is chatty, motivated, and straight out of college. She convinces the corporate boss Craig Gregory to consider making some technological revolutionary 'downsizing' moves to cut cost corners. That would be for all the employees to do the axing over teleconferencing instead of city-to-city travel. Of course, Ryan loathes the idea and puts his two-cents why that would be disastrous, not to mention will also entirely change his life and keep him grounded in the republic of Non-Mutual to Omaha. In order for Natalie to obtain more hands-on and personal experience, Gregory decides to have sex with Natalie. Oops, wrong review, that was from my 1994 film review of 'Disclosure'. What I meant to say that Gregory decides for Natalie to shadow Ryan during a tour-of-axing duty in order to obtain that experience. And that becomes the lesson learning plight for both Ryan & Natalie in 'Up In The Air'. Juno that with his masterful directorial piloting of 'Up In The Air', Jason Reitman has heightened himself to 'up in the list' as one of the most sought out directors in the industry. His timely depiction of the downsizing humane horror was upsized with precision and authenticity in 'Up In The Air'. Also, his 'non-crash landing' of the film's ending was unpredictable by cinematic nature. Reitman and co-writer Sheldon Turner also developed a sky-high clever screenplay. The last act of my 'Up In The Air' review before landing is on its stellar acting. I could not visualize anyone else than Clooney to fit the Bingham bill. By George, could it be another Oscar for George? Could someone already give Vera Farmiga the kudos she deserves? The veritas is that Vera continues to excel with her acting but most average moviegoers have never heard of her. Farmiga was pitch perfect as Alex, and I will 'farmiga' those Academy voters' offices if they do not give her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination. Anna Kendrick was a nice revelation as Natalie, but not yet in the 'calling the shots' acting category. However, Kendrick is one little actress with a big future. Jason Bateman took command of his role as honcho Gregory. I am glad that Reitman did not ax and still had room to include commendable brief supporting roles by Zach Galifianakis and J.K. Simmons as downsizing victims. Hey, I even enjoyed Danny McBride's performance as Ryan's sister's fianc√©e 'cold feet' groom. 'Up In The Air' is a first-class film, that is worthy of some frequent viewer mileage. ***** Excellent",9,0,9,7 December 2009
Atonement," Positive film review tone for Atonement
","My original psyche of the period film 'Atonement' was that it was going to be formulaic brit piece comprised of a bunch of socialites talking fancy, maids & butlers eavesdropping, protagonists trivializing major issues while defocusing on mundane matters, and all that 'mumbo jumbo' talk that you get from the cinema Britannica. I must state that 'Atonement' did encompass a few of the aforementioned elements, but the final product turned out to be a very enlightening film about atoning for one's immaturity. So 'Atonement', I am truly sorry I did you like that. Because after 'I saw it with my own eyes', I recognized that it did not merit my preconceived notion. I must atone myself now by writing a positive film review for 'Atonement'. The narrative stars James McAvoy and Keira Knightley portraying the romantic leads Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis. Robbie is the son of a Tallis' housekeeper and Cecilia is the eldest daughter of the wealthy Tallis family. So you see that Robbie does not have it 'made' and Cecilia is constantly financially nurtured by those 'Benjamin tallies'; or whatever Prime Minister is printed in the British currency bill. Robbie and Cecilia romantically fall for each other and are on route for the eventual nuptial until the visual disaster occurs. That would come in the form of Briony Tallis (played by Saoirse Ronan), the youngest Tallis who has a massive crush on Robbie, and her ravaging jealousy causes her to falsely witness a crime which she accuses Robbie as being the perpetrator. Poor Robbie gets convicted of the crime and ends up fighting in a war in order not to get jail time. So you can say that Robbie and Cecilia are apart because of the brawny Briony syndrome. The developmental plot of 'Atonement' focuses on Briony in various stages in her life trying to make amends on the hell she caused, and also on Robbie and Cecilia's emotional solitary grief. The performances from McAvoy, Knightley, and Ronan hit the right thespian tone of 'Atonement'. Admirable brawny supporting work was also contributed by Romola Garai (who played Briony at age 18) and the legendary Vanessa Redgrave (who played the geriatric Briony). Director Joe Wright, who also helmed 'Pride & Prejudice', should be proud of his unprejudiced direction of 'Atonement'. The costume design, art direction, and cinematography of 'Atonement' were of picturesque amazement. Christopher Hampton's scribe was adequate but not Oscar-worthy; even though I love the 'I saw him with my own eyes' line; It was an eye-opener! So all in all, you will not be sorry if you check out 'Atonement'. **** Good",8,1,1,4 February 2008
