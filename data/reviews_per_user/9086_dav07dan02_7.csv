Alien 3," the most underrated movie in the series
","Director: David Fincher, Story: Vincent Ward, Script: David Giler(Producer), Walter Hill (producer), Larry Ferguson, Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Brian Glover, Charles Dance, Charles S. Dutton This film picks up where Aliens left off. This time her ship lands on a planet full of male prisoners. Over the coarse of their time spent on this penal colony, most of the prisoners have converted to some sort of religion and are living like celibate monks. Riply, being the only female on the planet, is a threat to their call for celibacy. One of the Aliens was also transported to the planet from the ship so Ripley tries to get the prisoners to help fight the Alien only for her to discover that she is caring an alien inside her.These Alien movies are kind of interesting to review because each one is so different and fans of the series all have their opinions as to what their favorite one is. Most people vouching for either the first or second. Based on feedback I have read on IMDb, this film doesn't seem to rate as high for most people which is why I had mixed expectations before I saw the film. I have read all the negative reviews but on the other hand David Fincher is a highly praised director. His films are known for being dark, creepy and mysterious with good visuals ie: Se7en. I must say, I was not disappointed. I actually prefer this film to Aliens, the previous. This film is less of on action film (unlike Aliens)and more of a sci-fi horror like the first Alien film. Fincher was able to bring back the horror and mystery that Ridley Scott was able to capture on the first. This film is probably the goriest in the series. Based on how this film ends, the series could have easily ended here. Although I like Alien Resurrection so I'm glad they brought Ripley back!",9,3,6,22 September 2005
Hostel," hostel
","Director/Script: Eli Roth, Cast: Jay Hernadez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh), Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli), Barbara Nedeljakova (Natalya), Jana Kaderabkova (Svetlana), Jan Vlasak (dutch businessman)When I went to see this movie, I honestly did not think I was going to be able to make it through. The characters are so unlikeable and arrogant its no wonder half the world hates us Americans. They were such a bunch of loudmouthed jerks, I was hopping they would all get cut up. However, watching the film to the end, I can see why the director choose to depict the characters that way. The horror in this film really sets off in the second half when they end up at the torture chamber in that hell hole of a village in Slovakia. Really the only jerk in the movie was the Paxton character. However, one develops respect for him by the end of the film and are actually glad that he survives. When his friends start to disappear, Oli being the first, we can see that he truly does care for his friends. When he finally escapes from that dreadful place of torture, he is able to find a car that by chance has the keys still in the ignition! He could easily have left but he risks his life and getting tortured again by those sadistic freaks to save that Japanese girl when he hears her screaming knowing she is getting tortured.By having this film start out as a typical teen sex movie and gradually regress into extreme horror, these people are not so arrogant anymore but fearful beyond anyones imagination. It is probably well known by now that Eli Roth was inspired to make this film based on a Thai web site that advertised the torture of humans for a price that was shown to him by Quentin Tarantino. The web site was probably a hoax but who knows, maybe their is such a place in this world. Their is certainly enough sick f**ks in this world to support such a place! Roth did a very outstanding job of making the events in this film seem real. I must admit that I felt rather unsettled after leaving the cinema. This is without a doubt a more intense horror than is normally shown in theaters. When this comes out in its uncut form on DVD it might be an NC-17. I thought the theatrical version was close. The character of Natalya was quite the evil bitch! Barbara Nedeljakova did a great job portraying her. I agree with another commenter that described her as the ultimate femme fatal! It will be interesting to see if see gets cast in other films.",7,0,1,31 January 2006
Fargo," intense thriller! a modern film-noir
","Director: Joel Coen, Script: Ethan and Joel Coen, Cast: Frances Mcdormand, William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, Kristin Rudrud, Harve Presnell.This might just be the Coen brothers at their best. This film is funny, suspenseful and at times shocking. I just recently saw Raising Arizona again and although it is also a great film I think I prefer the dark comedy and 'film noir' elements of Fargo. Set in the heartland of Minnosota, this film is about a sales manager (Jerry played by William H. Macy) who is in deep financial trouble. He tries to con his rich father in-law out of a large sum of money by staging a kidnapping of his wife for ransom. He hires a couple of thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to do the job but things don't go quite as planned. People end up dead and now Jerry is in all kinds of trouble. The local police chief Marge (a very pregnant police chief played by Frances McDormand) gets involved in the case.I thought the Minnosota location in winter time was a perfect setting for this kind of film. It represents middle America turned upside down! Frances McDormand was great as the small town police chief. She was very funny and did a great job impersonating the Minnosota accent and words--yaw! Steve Buscemi is good as usual. Even as a tough bad guy his nerdy self still comes across! It is funny how he can be a absolute nerd like he was in Ghost World and a total bad ass in this film yet pretty much act the exact same way! This move is very violent and unsettling at times but it is offset somewhat by Marge and Norm (her husband). They offer some normalcy in this film. We take comfort in them.This film has the offbeat characters that the Coen brothers are known for. The excellent setting and cinematography, black humour and suspense make this film a must see. One of the best films of the 90's. A modern classic.",9,0,0,29 July 2005
American Beauty," what are we all searching for in life?
","Director: Sam Mendes, Script: Alan Ball, Cast: Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Meni Suvari, Chris Cooper, Peter Gallahger.Very good comedy drama by Menses and Ball. This film makes one think about what's really important in life. The Burnham family in this movie have a fancy house in a nice suburban neighbourhood with lots of materialistic things, yet none of them are happy. They are all searching for something that they cannot obtain. They have taken life and each other for granted, something all of us Americans do. This movie is really a character study on the members of the Burnham family:Lester (Keven Spacey), Carolyn (Annette Bening), and Jane (Thora Birch).Ricky Fits (Wes Bently), the new neighbour boy next door is the one character in this film who sees happiness within himself in spite of the problems around him. I think this is because he is able to see beauty in things that other people see as ordinary and he is able to enjoy the simple things in life. He comes across as being weird to other people but Jane becomes intrigued by him and the way he sees things. Carolyn is searching for happiness not from her family but through her career. And Lester,who much of this movie centres around, is going through a middle age crisis. He longs for the lifestyle he had when he was younger and happier. He is tired of the way he is being treated by his boss, he wife, his daughter. Two people in this film will have a profound effect on him: Ricky and Angela (Meni Suvari), Jane's high school friend. As the story starts to unfold and we learn more about the characters, we come to realize that people are not always who they seen to be. Meaning that once you really get to know someone, their is a lot more to them than what we saw superficially before we really knew them. For example, through most of the film Angela came across as being a self-centred, narcissistic little witch but as we got to know her toward the end of the film, she is actually very nice. She was just acting that way to hide insecurities within herself. This film has a downbeat ending but it is to be expected.This is a film that will stir up many emotions. All the characters are very well developed. With repeated viewings one can get something new out of this film. This film is a contemporary classic.",9,1,2,6 July 2005
Aliens," aliens
","Director/Script: James Cameron, Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Paul Riser, Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn Picking up right where the previous film left of, Ripley is wakened out of hypersleep by a salvage crew 57 years after the ship left the alien planet. She is brought back to the 'company' where she tells the story of what happened to the the rest of the crew. However, they don't believe her because the planet is now colonized with about 60 families living on it with no altercations. Evuantally, they loose contact with the colony so they want to send a group of marines to investigate and they want Ripley to go along as an adviser due to her knowledge of the planet. After they arrive on the planet, they discover that the whole colony has been massacred shy of a little boy and girl. The marines become victim.These alien films are rather interesting to review because they are all so different and fans of the series have such passionate differences of opinion as to what their favorite one is, most people favoring the first two. Aliens may be second only to the Star Wars films in the loyal following it gets from its fans. Aliens is unique amongst sequels in that it is actually favored by many fans. No doubt about it, this is a very effective film. It's got good special effects, cinematography, and action sequences. This plays much more like an action film than the previous. James Cameron did not want to duplicate Ridly Scott's film so he took a whole different direction. He had earlier made the Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger which was also an action sci-fi. Scott's first Alien film was a much darker film with more elements of horror.I am going to go against many fans (thank God IMDb doesn't list reviewers addressees!) but I was disappointed somewhat with this film. It's not a bad film by any means but I just don't think they were able to capture the same level of mystery or horror in this film which is also why I actually preferred the third one to this. I also felt this film to be to talky especially at the beginning. The marines where an overzealous, arrogant bunch much like the characters in Armagaden (although not that bad!). The crew in the first film were much more subdued in fact I'm not so sure they even liked each other! Anyhow, this is a good film overall but I am more of a fan of the first film.",6,22,42,27 September 2005
Halloween," halloween
","Director:John Carpenter, Script: John Carpenter and Debra Hill, Cast: Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Kyes(Loomis), P.J. Soles.There isn't much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said. It's influence on the horror and slasher genre had been overwhelming. This is a little off the subject but I will get to the point soon. I am a record collector and rock collectors often use the term 'pre' or 'post' Beetle to distinguish between groups that came before or after the Beetles. While, the same can be said about the film Psycho. I use the term pre-Psycho and post-Psycho to categorize horror movies because the horror genre changed so much after Psycho. OK to get to the point, Halloween is my favorite post-Psycho horror movie. It is one of the giants of the post-Psycho movies. The others are The Haunting(probably the best horror movie of all time), the ground breaking Night of the Living Dead by George Romero, Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, Bob Clark's Black Christmas and Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween has a reputation for being worse than it actually is in terms of gore and graphic violence. Like all great horror movies, it is the atmosphere and sense of doom that makes it so dam scary! They went over budget on this film to pay Donald Pleasence and he almost didn't take the part of Dr. Sam Loomis (it was already turned down by Christopher Lee). Irronically, of all the movies Pleasence was involved with this was probably the one he was most known for and he ended up doing all the sequels up until his death. Come on people can you really imagine another Sam Loomis besides Pleasence-I think not!John Carpenter is a director with a very big following. Some of his other great movies are Escape from New York, The Thing(The thing from another World)remake and a great one at that and The Fog. Before Halloween he did Assault on Precint 13, which was recently remade, and Dark Star.",10,0,1,8 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," the saga continues
","Director:Irvin Kershner, Script:Leigh Brackett, Lawrence Kasdan, Story:George Lucas, Cast:Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Alec GuinnesGeorge Lucas's decision to have someone else direct his film could have been a disaster but instead it worked out in the films favor. Kershner directed a very wonderful film here considered by many to actually be the best in the series. My mother-in law has all but the third on DVD so I've decided to watch all five that are currently out on DVD. I must say I think this might also be my favorite. This films seems to be more plot driven with perhaps less focus on the action than others in the series.After they destroy the death star(from the previous film), the rebel forces seek asylum on the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader and his forces find them there and they flee. Luke Skywalker and R2D2 end up on the swamp planet Dagobah. The atmosphere of this planet is very surreal. Here we are introduced to Yoda who we all knew from the two prequels. Yoda is the Judi master and he teaches Luke about the ways of the Jedi and the secret power of the force. Luke is also guided by the spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princes Leia end up on the planet Bespin. Here we are introduced to Lano, Han Solo's old friend and comrade. However, Darth Vader got there first and out of fear, Lando betrays his friend and hands them over to Darth Vador. Skywalker senses their danger and against the advice of both Yoda and Kenobi he leaves to save them.In this film, we are introduced to new characters and we also learn a secret about Darth Vader in relation to Luke Skywaklker(but I know none of you know this so I won't tell!). The previous film was a fun action oriented family film, this a much darker film. It deals with the forces of good and evil and its hero, Skywalker, is put into several situations where he is tempted to go over to the dark side. Also, Hans Solo is not rescued and we are not sure about what is going to happen to him. It seems as if the evil forces of Darth Vader are winning. This film leaves one wanting to see the next one. I have not seen episode six and I have heard it is not as good as ether this or A New Hope but It probably will reveal the fate of Hans Solo. One thing I personally liked about this film was the scenes at the beginning on the planet Hoth. The mountain scenes are beautiful. It is different from all the previous films. It actually looks like earth! I think it was filmed in either Alaska or British Columbia. Probably because it was a very high budget movie, it doesn't look as old as it is. Watch some low budget horror films from 1980 such as Friday the 13 and they seem very dated but this film holds up very well for a 25 year old film and to me looks as if it could have come out today.",9,0,1,13 June 2005
