Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A feast for the eyes, but not challenging for the brains at all
","The beginning of the movie is breathtaking, but when the big fish is eaten by the bigger one, and that one by the bigger one (and so on) it becomes clear that Lucas has no idea what is he talking about. The story is predictable and the characters don't change at all. There is no development, just an abundance of images. Little Lloyd looks like he exercised all his scenes in front of the mirror thinking: 'I'm good, I'm sure everybody likes me. I bet this one will bring a tear in someone's eyes.' I have seen more convincing performances by children of his age. A friend told me, she found a movie full of racism. All the good guys spoke with the english accent, and all the clumsy and ugly ones spoke with the accent close to the minorities. The Phantom Menace is like a great videogame. Who needs a story anyway? Still, it's worth seeing.",Null,0,0,7 October 1999
American Psycho," Totally empty
","It makes its point within the first ten minutes and then adds no more. The main character leaves the viewer totally cold, so you don't care what happens to him or anybody else in the movie. And the end is no revelation at all. I found the movie extremely boring and kept looking on my watch.",2,0,4,6 September 2001
The Matrix," computer rubbish - but it works
","In Matrix you can find anything from biblical element (the chosen one), fairy-tails (the kiss of life) and computer crime ... Very postmodern, but it worked very well for me. It helps if you like Keanu Reeves. It doesn't help if you hate the theatrical way of his speaking (and everybody else's).",9,0,1,3 September 1999
