Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Fasten your seat-belts
",The nay-sayers and the precious little angels will find fault in every aspect of this movie. If you listen carefully you can hear their bleating and whining from here. There will be those who would have you believe that this movie is like a dagger that has been plunged into their collective chests and offended all their sensibilities.NOT TRUE! If you have a clear conscience and a good heart you will laugh out loud through the entire movie.On the DVD ensure that you take the time to watch the extra scenes that were cut out by the censor. This time invested will be well rewarded. Like a fine port after a good meal.,8,1,2,3 July 2008
