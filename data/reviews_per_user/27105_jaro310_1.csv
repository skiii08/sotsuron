The Monuments Men," Nothing more than Oceans 11&12 in uniform
","George Clooney is proving to be as bad a writer as George Lucas and a director little better than Ed Woods. This is an important story from WWII and Clooney assembled a name worthy cast, gave them writer school dialogue, and poorly edited footage shot with lots of CGI and extras. I guess everyone involved got a nice payday and Clooney will go on to make many more films. Sadly, the public is taken to the cleaners. This is a truly bad movie. Hard to watch with very, very few redeeming moments.The characters are cartoon-ish and not very smart, although they are given what some think as witty things to say. Along the way Clooney's voice over is supposed to instill in the viewer a sense of awe relative the art theft and its damage to all mankind. I'd like to see this story in the hands of Tom Hanks and the 'Band of Brothers' and 'The Pacific' mini series' teams.",1,3,4,28 May 2014
