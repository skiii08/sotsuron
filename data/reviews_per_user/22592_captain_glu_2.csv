Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Cold, graphically one dimensional movie
","This movie was also terribly unfocused and cluttered, but that's nothing anybody else hasnt already said.What I DID like about it were the jedis. They gave you someone to root for but they really weren't given qualities different than those of the original trilogy, which was particularly where this movie could have done better.I do think as well we should use the technology we have today to do as much as we are able without using computer effects, rather than hitting the cgi for anything bigger than a breadbox. Remember the giant jawa tank thing in episode VI? No computer effects at all, and that's what made it so much more realistic, more alien.This movie didn't give me another real world to be in like the first 3 did.",Null,0,1,9 April 2000
The Lion King," Beautiful
","On anything but a childish level, this movie surrounds you in some of the most well done scenery I have ever seen in an animated movie. The music is the gorgeous counterpart to the environment, with some of the best compositions I've heard in a disney picture.The story is plain but powerful, the humor is pretty much all for the kids. But nevertheless, a beautiful movie.",10,0,0,9 April 2000
