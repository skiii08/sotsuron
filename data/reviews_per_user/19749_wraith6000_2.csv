Lucky Number Slevin," Have you ever sat down for a film and just asked yourself whats the point half way through?
","I remember back to a time when the idea of going to watch a thriller was preparing myself for a predictable experience. Films like The bone collector were easy to guess the outcome even before all the details were laid out. Don't get me wrong these films are great, if you prepared yourself not to expect too much. Lucky Number Slevin is different; the film starts of like all others in its genre, however don't be fooled by its seemingly hapless continuity. If you wait through the apparently mediocre beginnings you will see how these ideas combine together with a fast paced progression revealing a traditional 'vengeance' plot. All of which is conveyed under a perspective that makes it impossible to predict the outcome. The characters are well thought out; even the minor roles are somewhat influential, from the street-smart detective, and to a mobster's homosexual son. This film is masterful experience one for those willing to think.",10,4,7,17 November 2006
Transformers," The less you expect from this film, the more surprised you will be.
","For all those who don't believe this film is good, think about the tight line the director and scriptwriter have to tread when creating a film with such a steeped history and so many fans. Ill make my point very clear this is a recreational film, its for pure enjoyment. Don't criticize this film for a poor plot line and tedious characterizations because it was not made as a dramatical feature presentation. It was made purely to wow audiences with special effects and tell a story that is about 25 years old. You couldn't expect much from a plot line that old.I agree the film has many plot holes poorly developed plot twists, but you have to take the good with the bad. This is a recreational film for not only those who grew up with this beloved cartoon/comic but everyone who likes a bit of action a special effects once in a while. For the the die hard fans it certainly pays homage to the original cartoon even using the original names and vehicle types of the transformers(Deceptacons and Autobots). Those of you who are thinking of watching this film, please watch this film without any expectations, a neutral outlook on its various cartoon predecessors, and just a little bit of background knowledge on what the films about(... and I don't mean a full history). The less you expect from this film, the more surprised you will be.",9,0,2,6 August 2007
