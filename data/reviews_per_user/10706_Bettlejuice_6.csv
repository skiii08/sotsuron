Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Not the perfect comedy but not the worst one either.
","Most people that you talk to will be on either extreme when it comes to Borat. They will either be throughly discussed that such a movie was ever made or they will hail it for its perfect comedy and wonderful situations. To be completely far, neither of these people are right. Borat is as quotable as Airplane or The Holy Grail but the film itself is nowhere near what those films are. Brorat quotes are more like Napoleon Dynamite Quotes. If you want to think that there funny then you will but if you want to be offended then you will. At the same time though Borat is not the to crude to be funny movie that the other people have been calling it. yes some scenes are crude. Some jokes are too crude to be funny for some people. There are varying levels of crude jokes and just as many of them hit as miss. Borat in short is made up entirely of trailer jokes. Jokes that don't carry a movie but are funny enough to make people see the movie.",6,1,4,29 August 2007
Mississippi Burning," A great MOVIE. (but just a movie)
","1n 1964 three civil rights activists disappeared in Mississippi and the FBI was called in to investigate the disappearances. Up until this point I could be describing both actual events and the plot of Mississippi Burning but that is really about all of the similarities that there are between the two. Mississippi Burning is a great movie all in itself. The acting is superb from the two lead actors, especially on Willem Dafoe's part. (Though Gene Hackman was the one nominated for an Oscar) The movie tells a powerful story about racism and hatred in the south during the sixties. The story is engaging and the characters are convincing. However this movie cannot be considered in any way to be historically accurate. Many things were thrown into the story to make it a better movie despite their lacking in accuracy. For example the two FBI agents are portrayed as one being a by the book agent and the other being a down and dirty street smart kind of guy. An excellent selling point for a buddy cop formula but unrealistic. There is also an added character that never existed but was a black character that helped the FBI in the interrogations so that the heroes of this anti-racist movie would not all be white. This is not to say that Mississippi is anything short of excellent. But watch it for it's entertainment value, not it's historical accuracy.",Null,1,1,18 November 2007
The Devil Wears Prada," Really just an excuse to show off some really great clothing
","The Devil Wears Prada tells the story of Andy, a young reporter who lands a dream job working for Miranda at Runway, the best fashion magazine in New York. Although it is said numerous times in the movie 'a million girls would kill for this job,' Andy is not sure that she wants it. Here lies the first flaw of many thorough the movie. We are never told how Andy, a girl with no fashion sense whatsoever has been pushed to the top of the pile of candidates for the job. Yet we have to accept this and an expected turn of events if we are to make since out of the rest of the movie. The story is so cookie cutter that an audience could probably quote the characters along with the movie having never seen it before. Prada is also filled with outrageous coincidences in order to keep the story moving. (At least 4 in one span of 5 minutes) But a predictable story line does not always make for a bad movie. This movie is worth seeing for two reasons: the cloths and Meryl Streep.This movie is a fashion designers dream come true. If you love fashion, clothing, shopping, are a girl, or like to wear any cloths at all in public then this movie's wardrobe is a feast for the eyes. Anne Hathaway changes costumes like Amadala from Star Wars in this movie except she manages to make each and every outfit look more stunning than the last. Plus there is a scene where Andy walks into a massive closet stocked full of designer cloths that will make teenage girls squeal with joy.My personal favorite reason that I recommend this movie however is the performance given by Meryl Streep. Here portrayal of the ice queen of fashion is worth 4 of the 6 stars that I gave to this movie. If you don't get to this one in theaters then at least rent it to see Streep in all of here glory. You're in for a treat.",6,1,2,2 July 2006
The Man Who Would Be King," Impossible to say anything bad about it
","Is it really possible to hate a movie like The Man Who Would Be King? While it is understandable that it may not be your favorite movie, you just can't help enjoying at least some parts of the movie. At the same time nothing stands out about The Man Who Would Be King. The acting, directing, and story, all good, but none of them stand out as defining or extremely memorable. But this movie is still remembered and praised over thirty years later. Why is that? It's because, while nothing about The Man Who Would Be King excels, nothing about it is bad either.Told through a flashback, the man who would be king tells the story of two con men, played by Michael Cane and Sean Connery, who decide to con an entire country for its wealth wealth. After tracking across deserts and frozen mountain peaks, the two men come to the fictional country of Kafiristan, which is made up of about thirty warring tribes. After picking one of the tribes they began to train the natives to fight the other tribes with the intent of eventually taking over and unifying the entire country. However one of the men, Daniel Dravot (Connery), survives an arrow shot in battle and is mistaken for a god. Using this newfound advantage the two Englishmen began to take control of the entire country. The story is interesting and told well enough that the viewer does not get bored watching it, yet at the same time the turn of event throughout the movie feel almost inevitable. Its like reading a mystery aimed for young readers where and older and more advanced reader has spotted the fairly obvious clues and solved the mystery by chapter four.The choice of putting Connery and Caine together for this movie seems like an unusual choice but was an undeniably successful one. Film critics have compared their teaming up to that of others such as Robert Redford and Paul Newman. Connery and Caine play very different characters that feel like they should be conflicting with each other but instead each seems to complement the other nicely. Connery is reserved and stone faced through out the movie. Confident in his beliefs and determined to get them Connery pulls of the character so quietly that you can almost forget that you are watching Sean Connery on the screen. Michael Caine is another story altogether. Loud, crass, rebellious and fun loving, Caine's character of Peachy Carnehan almost seems like a young boy trapped inside an mans body. Throughout the movie Caine is the one who speaks back to authority and makes witty remarks to everyone that he meets. Both actor's strongest moment is in the same scene when they are arguing, and ironically the almost seem to be playing each other. Connery, while still quiet and stone faced wants to say where he is enjoying life, and Caine while still being a loud and crass character plays the more mature one who recognizes that they both need to leave.If there is one thing that can be considered epic about The Man Who Would Be King, it is the stunning scenery that is shown throughout the movie. Wide shots that show extensive deserts can take the audiences breath away with the raw beauty that is captured on footage. During a sequence where the heroes attempt to cross a mountain range, there is almost a montage of still clips of jagged cliffs and snow capped mountain peaks. Combining this sequence with almost the perfect music, it is one of the most captivating things in the entire movie. Even when majestic landscapes weren't being shown, the scenery was still captivating. The opening shots are of a market place in India, and while I knew ahead of time that they were actually filmed in morocco it had me believing that I was seeing an authentic Indian marketplace.Set in the 1800s this movie takes place around the end of British exploration and colonization. While the political message is subtle, it does seem to stand against colonization. The Man Who Would Be King shows all of the negative effect that come about by forcing a modern society onto an uncivilized people. Rudyard Kipling, the writer of the original short story was very much in love with the wild and the unknown that was left in the world and probably felt that the colonization of the British was taking away what unknown was left. Director John Huston had long been a fan of the original short story by Kipling and had wanted to make a movie of it for some time. In fact he had gotten the rights to the story early in the 50s hoping to use other actors. When he tried to get Paul Newman, who he had worked with in The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean, to be in the movie, it was Newman who suggested using Connery and Caine.All in all, The Man Who Would Be King is a memorable movie. It does not inspire you or make any shocking political statement but it does thoroughly entertain you for two hours. Fifty years from now, Film historians will probably not look back on it and say that it was one of the most defining movies of our time. But fifty years from now they will probably still know what it is.",7,3,7,21 October 2006
Army of Darkness," Ash is the Heart of Evil Dead
","Whether you watch the entire trilogy every month or only watched this movie because a friend made you, you can pretty much agree that the thing that is really driving the movies is the character of Ash. At the beginning of the story Ash is the calm simple person that we all are (the S-mart employee in this movie) but as the story progresses, he transforms into the chainsaw wielding ultimate badass with a sawed off shotgun that we all wish we could be. The character of Ash is in his prime from the point he says Groovy in Evil Dead 2 until the point he says Groovy in Army of Darkness when he replaces his chainsaw with a metallic hand. The chainsaw hand and the sawed off shotgun are a large part of the character of Ash. So why does Sam Rami decide to give Ash his hand back and make him fight with medieval weapons in Army of Darkness. With out the Ash from the first Evil Dead movies, Army of Darkness seems to be almost a different genre of movie. The final battle seems to be more like Jason and the Argonauts than Evil Dead. Still the movie is not without its moments. The first encounter between Ash and Badash one of my most memorable. (This one actually does involve the use of a shotgun) Also everyone knows the Boomstick line. (I went to high school with kids who could recite the entire monologue) All in all the film is a good one. It is very funny and deserves the cult status that it has achieved in this day and age. Although I personally wanted to see more of Ash in action, I guess I will just have to pray for Evil Dead 4.",7,2,4,1 April 2006
Semi-Pro," Will Ferrel plays another sport
","It can be said that any Will Ferrell movie can be summed up by the following Mad Lib: Will Ferrel plays (character name). He plays (sport) and is the best in the world until (problem) causes him to fall from grace. Watch as he works back to the top of his game. He even sings (title of a song) and says the line 'I will (do something uncomfortable) to your face.' Watch for a cameo from (other member of the frat pack).As far as the Will Ferrell plays sports genre goes, Simi Pro falls on the lower end of the scale. This time the sport is basket ball and the movie is set in the 70s to give Ferrel an excuse to have his hair big and his shorts small. If you loved Blades of Glory and Talladega Nights then you will probably have a good idea of what this movie is willing to offer. However, even then you might want to be prepared for disappointment.At this point even Ferrell sees to realize that he seems to be making the same movie over and over again and wonders whats the point here when they could just go watch Talladega Nights again. At least then Ferrell looked dedicated to the character. Even the movie seems to forget that he is the main character every now and then, focusing instead on Woody Harrelson, who seems to not realize that he is in a comedy, as he pines for an old flame.Ferrell still says lines that will probably end up on T-shirts, (If You have a small child use it as a shield)and is willing to have the camera pointed directly at his crotch, but the movie will probably end up in a Best of Will Ferrell collection a few years down the road and you can wait until then.",4,6,10,3 September 2008
