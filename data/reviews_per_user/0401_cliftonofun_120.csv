Ford v Ferrari," So. Damn. Fun.
","Damon did Damon things, and Bale did Bale things. More importantly, this movie managed to be sports-y and non-sports-y all at once. You still get all the adrenaline and polish of a giant victory rally, but you also get the kind of character-driven drama that's typically reserved for awards season. Let's be clear: this is a dad movie, and I am the target dad. But I have never cared about race cars or watched people turn left on TV...and I absolutely loved all 150 minutes of this story. Movies are supposed to help you forget real life and remember real life all at once. That's just what this one did.",8,3,4,4 January 2020
The Lobster," A brilliant movie that needed...something
","The concept here is pretty brilliant: a dystopian reality that legislates coupledom. From single people becoming animals to characters being defined by their limitations, this film points out the absurdities of our society's obsession with romance. In fact, it borrows heavily from the theater of the 'absurd.' And that's both genius and problematic. Because it's hard to care about flat characters who engage with sillier and sillier circumstances. I kept thinking this movie should be amazing...without ever caring what happened to the protagonists. And that's kind of a problem.",7,1,2,27 December 2017
Blade Runner 2049," A suitable follow-up that stands on its own
","Following up on a cult sci fi classic is not quite impossible. But it is close. Villeneuve's task is Herculean, and he basically nails it. From the visual scope to the sonic experience to the slowly evolving mystery, this movie returns to the world of Blade Runner...while also offering something new that stands on its own. It is cinematic and emotional and stunning. That said, a lot has changed since 1983. This film is great, but it is hard to impress me with visuals now, and stories about noir near futures are not novel anymore. I'm not sure we needed another Blade Runner, and I could have re-watched 'Her' to get the same themes. But if we were gonna do another one, I'm glad this director was around to make it happen.",8,0,4,27 December 2017
Million Dollar Arm," Nothing exceptional, but decent family film
","If you looked up 'family movie' in the dictionary, this film would be listed there. Nothing exceptional, but enough fun, laughs and story to go around. Great casting and some great moments...even if the script could have been slightly less cliche.",6,0,0,26 December 2017
First Man," More than just a space film
","There have been plenty of space program movies already, so it is fair to wonder why we need another one. Couldn't we just watch Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff again? Yes, we could. But this movie proves that these stories can still be compelling. And maybe even more personal than ever before. This isn't just another space film. It is the story of Neil Armstrong specifically - his drive, his losses, his relationships. There may have been space movies that are more majestic or thrilling, but the stakes have never felt this high. From the very first moment, you see everything through that personal lens: the shaky fear, the quiet desperation, the nervous anticipation. Chazelle knows how to tell a story. This plot may be super familiar, but I have never hung on each moment like I did this time. I couldn't help but care, even though I knew exactly what was coming next. The great acting and great directing made it worth going back to the moon again.",8,0,1,26 October 2018
Howl's Moving Castle," Bizarre and wonderful
","Classic Miyazaki, from the magical realism to the strong female protagonist to the dark humor to the story that sucks you in despite being somewhat convoluted. Plus, this one has the added benefit of being commentary about the pointlessness of war. It's not his best ever (aka Totoro), but it is pretty great nonetheless.",8,1,1,26 December 2017
3:10 to Yuma," A solid throwback
","I will fully admit that this movie goes well beyond slightly implausible to fairly ridiculous (especially over the last 20 minutes or so). But here's the thing: it earned the right to do so with great performances, stellar direction, and a perfectly paced story. Everything works. So when it inevitably devolves into a clichÃ© Western shoot em up, you care way too much to be bothered by it. Crowe and Bale alone make this one worth a couple hours.",7,1,2,21 April 2018
John Wick," Dialogue not needed
","Some films are at their best when they are monosyllabic. Every rhythm, moment and action sequence here was familiar, but this movie knew what it was...through and through. The action did the talking, and the characters did the opposite. The stylized violence became almost a dance: music + guns, no words required. And - other than the few moments of Keanu talking - it was pretty perfect.",8,0,1,27 December 2017
A Star Is Born," Predictable, but powerful
","This movie really should have felt cliche. We have (literally) seen this story before, after all. Repeatedly. Add in a movie star wanting to be a director and a singer wanting to be an actor...well, I wondered how often I would roll my eyes. But I didn't. Not even once. The first moment when they meet feels real. The first moment when Jackson calls Ally out on stage is absolutely electric. From that point on, it is just hard not to care. Everything works. In fact, I forgot about the performances and just fell into the story. So it may not be the most original movie (and perhaps the first half was stronger than the second half), but it is a story well told, nonetheless.",8,1,3,7 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Re-imagining Star Wars
","When I first heard that there would be stand alone Star Wars movies, I was skeptical. But this film left me more optimistic. Seeing a Star Wars story without having to relive the structure/character/pace of the first seven was pretty freeing, actually. It was not necessarily original (plenty of old school westerns and war movies felt similar), but it worked. And just as Winter Soldier imagined super hero tales as a spy movie, Rogue One imagined Star Wars as a classic war adventure. The characters work, the homages are well done and I was sucked in. Plus, it answered some fun questions from back in the day. I just wish we could have avoided CGId versions of actors from 40 years ago.",7,0,0,27 December 2017
Captain Marvel," An 'old fashioned' action movie
","Considering this movie is about alien warfare erupting on earth in the 90s, It is surprising how seriously it takes itself. Yes, our protagonist engages in witty banter with friends and enemies alike, but this is not Guardians of the Galaxy or Ant Man...there are comedic moments, yes, but nobody will mistake it for a comedy. This movie cares deeply about its characters - even the aliens, even the supporting cast. Honestly, that was refreshing. It is almost like Marvel turned time back to an era when action movies could be about finding ourselves, discovering our power, and sacrificing for others. The down side of that is this story feels a little cliche and predictable at points. (We have seen it before, after all.) The upside? It never gets too serious or too sappy or too sarcastic, and those are traps many comics movies have fallen into in recent years. There's a good balance here. It wasn't my favorite MCU movie, but it was solid nonetheless.",6,2,7,16 March 2019
World War Z," Intensely illogical (and just as messy)
","The critic and audience responses were not bad here, so it seemed like a guilty pleasure option. Wrong. This was an intensely illogical film with messy effect and messier story lines. Calling it silly almost gives it too much credit.",3,1,4,26 December 2017
Zootopia," Ingenious and subversive, but just a start
","Disney certainly has its mojo back. This movie managed to be original, hilarious and brilliant storytelling...not only that, but it was pretty ingenious/subversive commentary too. I wish that they would have done more to address systemic oppression rather than just individual stereotypes, but it was intended to be a conversation starter (as opposed to the entire conversation). Certainly a movie that is worth re-watching and discussing.",8,12,18,27 December 2017
42," A better story than a movie
","As a family movie about sports, history, and civil rights, this film works. It is hard NOT to be compelling with this story, after all. Almost every single powerful moment or conversation actually happened. Jackie Robinson's journey was indeed epic. But there are some pretty serious flaws too. Flaw 1: Harrison Ford's attempted impersonation of Branch Rickey is super-distracting, especially because the director seems to agree with Ford that this movie is about him. Flaw 2: this feels like a Disney-fied version of history at points...too many touching changes of heart and a hero that feels a bit too perfect. So you end up with a great story and a just ok movie. Too bad, but not bad either.",6,1,2,16 January 2018
Last Flag Flying," Great cast, average story
","This film felt far more like a play or TV movie than anything else - lots of dialogue, minimal soundtrack, and a few too many convenient plot leaps. Also, it tries a *little* too hard at almost every moment. But when Linklater writes your play, you can get Carrell, Cranston, and Fishburne to star. For all the flaws here, they act their asses off. And while the story is hardly perfect, we could use more like it too (even if they could be better executed). The story stays true to its characters, and works best at its quietest moments.",5,0,0,4 July 2018
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Not perfect, but not half bad either
","I somehow did not watch this movie for 15 years, despite having enjoyed these books as a child and as a parent. I'm not totally positive what held me back, but it may have been the sense that even with great CGI (check), some strong performances (check), and faithfulness to the book (check) this would be hard to get totally right. I was mostly right about that. That said, we watched right after re-reading this book with my youngest, and I can say that it mostly worked. It is not LOTR (or anywhere close), but that's not a fair standard - especially for a children's book. The middle sagged, and the embellishments were unnecessary...but it was worth watching.",6,1,1,11 February 2018
Us," Full of surprises (and great performances)
","Full disclosure: I am not a horror film buff. That makes it pretty tough for me to compare this film with others in its genre or write eloquently about all its homages, references, and influences. But you know what I can say? This movie was REALLY well done, and Jordan Peele is already a must watch director for me. 'Us' consistently surprised me, from the story to the characters to the humor. (Plus, Lupita Nyong'o alone is worth the price of admission.) Much like 'Get Out,' this story worked on many levels. Yes, it scared me...but it also made me think. So while it was a bit more gruesome and the plot had far more holes, I would still line up to watch it again. After all, it is not often a movie sends me off to look up Bible verses and director interviews, but that's where I'm off to next. I don't want horror that's about nothing more than violence and thrills, but if it is about something more? Well, I'm suddenly interested.",7,1,3,31 March 2019
Knives Out," I miss movies like this.
","This movie does not involve capes or 'IP.' It is not a sequel. It is not adapted from a novel. It is not an art house flick or Oscar bait. Which begs the question...how did it get made? All I know is Rian Johnson just proved it is still possible to write and direct a great genre film that is self aware but still takes its story and its characters seriously (and even manages to make some points without trying too hard). The cast is great. The homages to classic murder mysteries are fantastic. The humor is both hilarious and subtle. The twists are just right. I hope EVERYONE goes to see it because EVERYONE can enjoy it. Here's hoping more filmmakers (and studios) are willing to tell these kinds of stories. In an era where most blockbusters feel derivative, sometimes originality is just telling familiar stories really damn well and making them feel new again.",8,5,18,27 November 2019
The Irishman," A new take on a classic tale
","Yes, this film is probably too long. Yes, this film is also well done and worth your time. Both of those things can be true simultaneously. When I heard Scorsese was revisiting the gangster genre, I did wonder, 'Again? What else is there to say?' Good news: there was, in fact, more to say. This movie is less about the rush of rising in the ranks and more about the utter isolation that is left when it is over. While I found some of the 'de-aging' effects distracting, every single performance was masterful, and this movie is a perfect epilogue to previous gangster stories. When the lights fade and the violence stops, we are all left to reconcile - with ourselves, with our families, with our morality. What this film lacked in epic tracking shots or peak moments, it made up for with new perspectives on old stories.",7,2,6,2 December 2019
Creed," More remake than sequel...and it works
","Tis the season for sequels that are actually remakes. I will admit that I rolled my eyes when this one was announced, but somehow Coogler and Jordan (especially the latter) made it an actual film...a worthy successor to Rocky I & II. Yeah, it was a Rocky movie, but it was a good Rocky movie. Nobody's said that for a LONG time.",8,2,2,27 December 2017
Spotlight," Nothing groundbreaking, but still fantastic
","There's nothing especially groundbreaking here: investigative journalists uncover a big story. Imagine 'All The President's Men' with abusive priests. But the ensemble's simply fantastic, and McCarthy lets them take center stage while the audience investigates alongside them. The film's rhythm is just like research/writing: small leads, longer convos, bigger patterns and the sudden connecting of dots. The story becomes so much more than the abuse scandal we already knew about. It is an affecting revelation...for the characters and the audience.",9,0,0,27 December 2017
My Neighbor Totoro," Magical, real, and wonderful
","This movie ended and my son said two things: 'Please say it's not over!' and 'I wanna watch it again!' Enchanting hardly covers it. Magical, real and wonderful. The bar for animation was raised in 1988, and I'm not sure it has ever been reached since.",10,0,0,26 December 2017
Deadpool 2," I got what I paid for (but would have loved more)
","If the first Deadpool was over the top, I guess this one was over the topper? This movie was somehow even more excessive than the first - from violence to vulgarity to so many one-liners that you can barely keep up. Did I chuckle? Absolutely. Quite often, actually. I got exactly what I paid for. But here's the thing: I did not actually care what happened to anybody, which is a kinda important part of storytelling, right? The plot seemed mostly like an excuse for fun music, cool action sequences, and a ton of sarcasm. I knew that going in, so no complaints. But this formula is gonna run out of steam fairly soon. In a year where we're re-discovering comic book comedy, I'd re-watch Thor Ragnarok before I re-watched this one (and it is not especially close)",6,0,2,6 June 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Silly, ridiculous, and wildly fun.
","Thor is always going to be silly, but this chapter wisely embraced the silliness. Plus, everyone from Hemsworth to Blanchett to Goldblum (and perhaps the best director cameo ever) just plain nailed their roles. Nobody will remember it as original storytelling, but nobody will walk away without being entertained either. From the slapstick to the battles, everything worked. I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.",8,2,4,27 December 2017
Ready Player One," A fun ride* (asterisk = but it could have been better)
","This book was basically a giant (and entertaining) adventure in nostalgia. And the film was fairly similar. Of course, the book was better. And I do not say that because they changed things (you have to) or because books are usually better (they are). The issue here: the book fades over the second half when the conceptual novelty wears off...the film starts so fast that it fails to establish the characters all that well in the first place. So while the adventure is fun and the references are great, that lack of exposition leaves you caring less as the story goes on. The concept was still inventive and the story still worked, but the stakes would have been higher with more complex characters and more developed relationships. Also, Cline's preachiness in the hands of Spielberg leads to this movie trying just a BIT too hard at points. Shocking, right? All that said, I still mostly enjoyed the ride, and you will too.",6,1,2,23 April 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A little too quiet and slow
","When inebriated, this movie essentially involves lots of quiet and well dressed British men walking in and out of rooms. Also, there's a mole. Pretty, though.",6,0,1,27 December 2017
The Hateful Eight," Not Tarantino's best
","Several gunshots go awry in this film, and unfortunately the movie itself misses the mark, also. I never quite cared about the characters. The plot intrigued but never truly captivated. Even the glorious 75mm shots seemed a little superfluous. It was a 2 hour and 45 minute exercise in dialogue and double cross. And listen: I like dialogue. I especially like Tarantino dialogue. But this movie was easily 45 minutes too long. It's a very well made waste of time, but it remains a waste of time.",4,1,2,27 December 2017
"I, Tonya"," Ironic, unconventional, and totally authentic
","When Tonya Harding looked up mid-scene to say. 'This is bulls--t. I never did this.'...that's when I knew this was my kind of true story. Not fake-inspiring. Not fake-anything. It was an ironic and unconventional mockumentary, but it also captured the heart of the story - a poor ugly duckling who never quite fit into the one place she was born to be. Also, from the soundtrack to the performances, every scene was pitch perfect. You can argue that it tried a little too hard or misconstrued the story...but you cannot argue it failed.",8,0,0,4 April 2018
Molly's Game," Soooooo Sorkin-y
","This film was soooooo Sorkin-y. The opening monologue was pitch perfect, the dialogue was crackling with wit, and the characters oozed with intelligence. Plus - conveniently - this true story was incredible enough that it did not require that much fictionalization (of course, you could argue Facebook's story didn't either). For the most part, the movie works. The protagonist and the structure are strong enough to cover over any other issues. But being Sorkin-y does have some drawbacks: the occasional line that tries a little too hard, the thematic element that is a bit too pronounced. It is also 30 minutes too long because it is tough editing yourself when you are that gifted of a writer. So the movie is really good, but not quite great. But I would still watch anything Sorkin writes in a heartbeat.",7,0,2,15 April 2018
Moana," The same ol' formula, but absolutely beautiful nonetheless
","So I may be a teensy weensy bit biased as a former resident of the South Pacific who has a huge man crush on Lin Manuel Miranda, but I just plain loved this story. From the complex characters to the catchy music to the honoring of island culture, they knocked it out of the park. We've seen this Disney formula before, but I'm not sure we've ever seen it this well done.",8,1,2,27 December 2017
BlacKkKlansman," A solid Spike Lee joint (even if it could have been better)
","Here's the thing: it is possible for me to say that this movie works, that this Spike Lee joint is his best in a while, that it is both funny and powerful...but still think it could have been a little better. That's where I am. The movie's great as a broadly comedic satire with a political edge, and its many homages to film (from blaxploitation to D.W. Griffith) feel on point and at home here. More importantly, Lee brilliantly leverages a 1970s tale to shine a light on what's happening around us right now. So what could be better? Well, that light is REALLY bright. This is not a subtle political satire. At all. Typical Spike, basically. Also, the plot's pacing leaves something to be desired. And the characters sometimes seem a bit less than real. In fact, it is kind of funny that a movie inspired by a true story is most challenged by a lack of realism. But there you are. Still, Lee adapts this tale brilliantly. It is funny and exciting and insightful, especially as an examination of self identity. Just because it is flawed doesn't mean it isn't great.",7,13,30,20 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Back and better than ever
","I was kinda nervous about this one, honestly. I mean, how many times can we reboot this story? Thankfully, Marvel absolutely nailed their first chance at Spidey. The story somehow felt both true to the comics but also updated for a new generation, from the casting to the overall tone. It was fun. It was funny. It was youthful. It was simple. They borrowed heavily from previous Spider-man playbooks: a teenager learning how to be a superhero, which inevitably includes mistakes. The teen movie vibe serves that function well, and the younger actors kill every part. Granted, it is not perfect. The worst moments predictably involve (a) grown-ups talking with grown-ups, (b) action sequences that are muddy/hard to follow, (c) attempts to tie into the broader Marvel cinematic universe. Still, the movie manages to lightly float above all that. It is hard not to cheer for and laugh with this Spider-man.",8,0,3,27 December 2017
Begin Again," Not 'Once' unfortunately
","The thing about 'Once' was that it was total magic: you literally watched the music and voices BECOME something. This time around, Carney assembles a way more accomplished cast with way better production value...but the magic is missing. Ruffalo does his very best, but the premise and the core song are a stretch. 'Once' worked best when the music played, and this one works best when it stops. It is not awful, but it is not great either. There are plenty of great Ruffalo performances out there, so find another one.",5,0,1,27 December 2017
Doctor Strange," Muddled, but a blast anyway
",Strange? Check. Not sure that I could explain what happened (beyond 'imagine if The Matrix and Inception had a baby') but I can say that it was wildly entertaining. Mostly because of the laughter and performances along the way. It was the freshest feeling Marvel movie I have seen in a bit. And that's a good thing.,7,1,1,27 December 2017
Interstellar," Really long...and really good
","This film was silly, long, overwrought and pretty far-fetched. But Nolan keeps you in it, emotionally and intellectually. He's a master storyteller even when the story itself fails at points. I could have done without the last 1/3, but the first 2/3 left me intrigued and breathless...just like he likes it. At one point a character demonstrates the time space dimension with a folded piece of paper; Nolan's films are just that: pages of a story folded over and over. You will love the characters, the pathos and the journey even when the point feels a bit - well - pointless. Plus, hard to fault a Science Fiction film for going all religious/philosophical. It's happened before and will happen again.",8,0,0,26 December 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A story that tries really hard, but is hardly 'real'
","Martin McDonagh is an exceptional writer - I will never forget seeing 'Beauty Queen of Leenane' on Broadway many years ago. So it is not surprising that this film has some compelling characters and scenes to go along with its intriguing premise. However, it is surprising how RIDICULOUS everything else seems to be. As Wesley Morris pointed out in the NYT a while back, there's nothing 'real' about Ebbing. At all. It is an ultra-unrealistic blend of Hollywood's many non-existent US small towns. And the cast of characters being drawn together there makes zero sense. Just like the wardrobe and the inexplicable choices and the way the characters talk to each other. Basically, it is kind of a mess. the cartoonish nature of it all makes caring pretty tough, despite some great performances. There's a lot of promise here (and even some comedy), but very little of it pays off.",4,12,19,1 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A bit too much (but fine, I guess?)
","It is not easy to end a trilogy (or a...nine-ogy?). The fact that this movie mostly works, manages closure, and has some epic final moments means it did okay. That said - much like Return of the Jedi - it did not live up to its predecessors. There were a few too many callbacks, a few too many endings, and a WAY too many earnest moments when characters told the audience how they should feel and what they should learn. (Plus, the movie just kept undoing itself over and over?) More than anything, I just wanted fewer speeches and cameos. Still, Rey has been the character that made you care and cheer for a while now (and Kylo Ren was not far behind), bringing a sense of newness and familiarity that made this whole thing work. It was pretty rewarding to see the end of that journey, even if I wanted a bit more dueling and a bit less talking.PS - I also have some issues with, you know, the entire plot and structure of this movie which kept getting distracted by pointless reveals and new backstories. But I could have lived with that if it told the story well.",6,1,12,24 December 2019
Lion," Gripping, moving, and worthwhile
","The first 30-45 minutes of this film were beyond gripping, the epitome of 'show don't tell.' While something was lost when the film got more talk-y and there were points where I felt a bit emotionally manipulated, the whole thing coasted on that strong start: a lost kid searching for home. No wonder you cannot help but be moved by the whole thing. Sometimes that is all you need.",8,0,0,27 December 2017
Ant-Man," Not bad at all, but could have been better
","Listen...this was a superhero movie that knew just enough to laugh at itself and have fun. Bonus points? Absolutely. But there's a point where self satire is not quite enough. Michael Pena and Paul Rudd made this thing work. But I would have loved just a WEE bit less cliche. I'm not sure what I want from a superhero movie anymore, but it is slightly more than this.",6,0,0,27 December 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," A movie that sucks...and mostly works
","This film is basically a Queen medley with occasional scenes, but a fake set of teeth and an amazing catalog of songs is apparently enough to make a fairly watchable movie, as silly as that seems. Stephen Hyden of Grantland/Ringer fame captured it well: 'Bohemian Rhapsody has been likened to a 'glorified Wikipedia entry,' but that's actually a disservice to Wikipedia....still, if you regard Bohemian Rhapsody as an excuse to sit in the dark and listen to Queen songs, well, there are far less entertaining ways to spend two hours.' I mean, this movie was cartoonish and inaccurate and not especially good. But I could not take my eyes away from it. It never should have garnered awards nominations, but it I can still see why everyone flocked to theaters for it. When I think of 2018 musicals, I will think of 'A Star Is Born.' But that movie did not have a soundtrack by Queen.",5,1,3,17 February 2019
Baby Driver," Enough style to make up for the substance
","Every sequel or comic book movie promises 'adrenaline' and/or 'thrills.' This is the rare summer film that delivered just that. It was perfectly scored, perfectly filmed, and perfectly executed - from beginning to end. Was the ending a bit TOO perfect? Yeah, perhaps. But by that point I didn't care. Anyone who did not enjoy this movie has something wrong with them. I mean, it was practically an action romance musical! It shouldn't win any Oscars, but anyone buying tix to the latest franchise should seriously reconsider. This is what blockbusters should look like.",8,1,3,27 December 2017
The Revenant," Movie theaters were built for experiences like this
","Some people will complain about the visual extravagance or the simple emotional notes here...but you gotta be dead not to enjoy this film. Inarritu just followed Birdman (all the words) with The Revenant (no words needed). Enough said. And as if the directing effort was not sufficient/staggering enough, he got two true stars at their absolute pinnacles. This could have been a simple survival and revenge tale, but the visual flair and acting take it to another level. This is what movie theaters are for.",9,0,0,27 December 2017
Split," Same old Shyamalan
","The issue with recent Shyamalan movies has never been style or execution. Unfortunatey, though, his solid (and often gorgeous) film making often hides a fundamentally flawed story - desperate attempts at his trademark twist, shoddy character development, giant plot holes. Sometimes he nails it, but sometimes he misses badly. Since this one did well at the box office, I assumed it was a return to form. Kind of? I mean, there were some really interesting suspense and horror moments. The central characters were mostly developed well. But the resolution (like many of his films since - well - Sixth Sense) tried a little too hard. It was solidly entertaining, but not one I will think about much after this.",6,0,2,18 May 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," I thought this was a bad idea. And I was wrong.
","When I heard the set-up for this movie, I thought, 'No way. We have already had entirely too many Spider-man movies, and the concept's kinda weird, and they are trying to fit WAY too many characters and plots into this one story.' I could not have been more wrong. The degree of difficulty here was super-high, but Marvel still stuck the landing. They introduced a new Spider-man while paying homage to other Spider-man stories and creating something that felt entirely original...and they did it without rehashing the origin story all over again. There were moments where there was a little too much happening, but the choices almost entirely paid off and almost all the characters were given their due. Plus, the animation was just plain gorgeous and the soundtrack was great. Overall, it was a great movie experience. I might have liked a simpler story a little more, but mostly I just want more of the Miles Morales Spider-man in my life.",9,2,4,21 December 2018
Divergent," At least you get some cool Chicago shots?
","The book got points for originality and vision, even if the pacing and love scenes were awful. The movie? Other than Chicago shots and Shailene Woodley's performance, it had little going for it. Then again, that was something. It had moments...they were just too few and far between.",5,1,3,26 December 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Laughable and unapologetic
","Was this film laughable? Oh, yes. But while every recent comic book and spy movie desperately wants to be dark/serious (Hi, DC comics!) or meta (Hello, Deadpool!), the MI movies are a rare franchise: they are unapologetic. They are silly and ridiculous and excessive. No apologies. While Bond gets gritty, MI gets - well - fun. And suddenly we all remember that predictably comic thrill rides are worth the price of admission. Eventually, the Tom Cruise run will become the Jeremy Renner run. But the franchise will live. It just needs to remember that masks and twists are not a bad formula.",6,1,2,27 December 2017
Dunkirk," A breathtaking film, despite a few flaws
","Nolan is obviously a special filmmaker. He can tell a complex war story without words. He can leave you breathless on the edge of your seat even though you don't know any characters' name or stories. And this film is extremely Nolan-y. No voiceovers or triumphant battles here. Just a few characters' interwoven paths through 36 hours of suffocating panic and chaos. Zimmer's score is perfect, and the cinematography is majestic. The movie sometimes feels torn between a classic war film and a classic Nolan movie, but the in between-ness works.",8,0,1,27 December 2017
Now You See Me," A whole film of 'Gotcha!'
","You know that moment in every heist movie where they suddenly reveal that they tricked you? 'It was that person all along!' or 'Wait...that's what happened?' Well, this is just scene after scene of those moments. For an hour or so that can be pretty fun, but the tricks played on the audience during this film got more and more implausible (and eye roll inducing, honestly). There is nothing wrong with messing with the crowd a bit, but you should probably respect an audience more than this. Also, seeing this cast waste their talents on cute drivel was a major bummer.",3,0,1,27 December 2017
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Solid...when it takes itself less seriously.
","Rumor has it that DC has a new 'no joke' policy for its movies. Not sure that this is true, but this movie works best when it laughs: history jokes and character tensions and winks at the camera. The moments of fun are great, and the moments of seriousness are almost unintentionally amusing. A little too much. Comics were never meant to be literature, and this movie mostly remembers that. A fun ride.",6,0,0,26 December 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Cool action that did not make enough sense
","I complained that last year's Avengers movie felt burdened by the many subplots, characters and cliches. This 'super' story was more focused, even though the whole gang showed up. It was about friendship and consequences. That works. Unfortunately, the two characters that most forced action (Stark and the villain) stopped making rational decisions eventually...also, when Spidey went away, so did the humor. So it was really good, but not great.",6,2,3,27 December 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Love the magic, but the story was scattered
","Love the magic, love the creatures, love the chance to revisit this world with some fun protagonists. But the story was scattered, partly because origin movies have to introduce SO much. (Simply keeping track of the creatures would have taken a detailed spreadsheet.) And I wish the bad guys were as developed as the good guys. Still, fun holiday movies are not a bad thing.",6,1,1,27 December 2017
Inside Out," Pixar still has it
","I thought Pixar had lost their fastball after their last couple efforts. Never mind. This movie once again made me both laugh and cry. Also, it did that with the most unique and original story I had seen in a long time. Inventive and amazing stuff.",9,1,6,26 December 2017
Yesterday," Good movie, great songs.
","Yeah...that headline is my summary. Richard Curtis knows how to write a romantic comedy: star-crossed friends who seem destined to be more, quirky sidekicks that make you laugh. It is a formula, but it is a formula that works. I mean, Notting Hill meets the Beatles? Seems perfect. But this move never quite realizes its potential, partly because the romantic plot starts feeling cliche, partly because the Beatles were more than just song writing, partly because this story lost its way 2/3 of the way through. I still enjoyed it more than I expected. It is just that there's a difference between being well done and being original.",6,3,6,12 October 2019
Avengers: Endgame," A fitting climax
","Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU.",7,5,9,5 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Not sure this was necessary...but I was charmed nonetheless
","Toy Story somehow kept getting better across parts 2 and 3. They introduced characters you immediately cared about. They found new layers of emotion. They evolved from being movies about toys to a being movies about life. There were some diminishing returns this time around: this chapter of the story was not really needed, and we did not get much time with some of the characters we grew to know/love. Buuuuuuuut...it was still a solid story. The antique shop worked. The carnival worked. The last chapter for Woody worked. As a result, I found myself caring and laughing and getting more emotional than I expected. It was not Toy Story 3, but that's a high bar. This was a great sequel, even if it had a hard act to follow.PS - That first scene in the antique shop? Scariest scene in a movie this year.",7,0,2,21 July 2019
The Favourite," I don't usually like place intrigue...but this works
","Don't really enjoy palace intrigue stories much, but I enjoyed this one. The big difference? Farce. Most films about courts take themselves sooooo seriously (and move sooooo slowly). This on did not. And every extreme (from events to performances to dance moves) pays off with a laugh. Plus, those laughs never undercut the tension created by the main characters. I had seen this story before, but I had not seen it done this well.",7,2,5,27 January 2019
Foxcatcher," Great performances, great tension
","The absolute epitome of 'show don't tell.' This film builds its tension and develops its characters with actions...not words. Plus, the performances - from Carrell to Ruffalo - are fantastic. Granted the plot is uneven and slow, but the overall effect is chilling nonetheless.",8,1,1,27 December 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Sometimes more is less
","Unpopular opinion: the Avengers movies have been suffering from the law of diminishing returns. The solo movies still work brilliantly, but the giant ensembles started collapsing under the weight of characters and plot lines right around when Ultron showed up. This one faired slightly better for a few reasons. First, the giant cast divided and conquered, allowing for A, B, C, D, and E plots - and each story worked pretty well. Second, they have introduced so many new (and funny) characters to the MCU that this edition was infused with some fresh energy and laughter. Buuuut...there were still too many characters. A movie like this cannot reach the heights of Homecoming, Ragnorok, or Black Panther. Less is more. So this film inevitably succumbed to being more about setting up future franchises than about the characters themselves. It was fun and intense, but I'm looking forward to when the stories get smaller and more focused again.",7,4,10,30 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Could have been shorter...but then there would be less to love
","I have not enjoyed a Tarantino film this much in some time. In fact, I have not enjoyed a movie theater experience this much in some time. Yes, it is too long. Yes, it seems more than a little scattered structurally. BUT it is also Tarantino at his semi-best. If you want someone to make a nostalgic film with a late-60s soundtrack that re-imagines a historical moment, places movie stardom in a new light, and brings a perfect balance of creepiness and comedy, well, he is absolutely your guy. Just as importantly, DiCaprio and Pitt are your guys for these roles. They find every comedic and cathartic moment without becoming too one dimensional, and I just could not help but watch them. I probably would have enjoyed a tighter and more consistent version of this movie...but then there would have been less of it to love.",8,1,4,7 August 2019
Gone Girl," Nails the tone, but the book's flaws remain
","Some movies fall short of the book versions, and - very rarely - some movies exceed the books that inspired them. This one? About the same, honestly. Gripping for the first third, electrifying for the middle third and crippled by its implausibility over the last third. Fincher nailed the tone perfectly, though, and that certainly did not hurt. Pike nailed it too...you almost forgot how ridiculous the character was.",6,0,1,26 December 2017
Get Out," Not overrated. Not at all.
","I definitely wondered whether the 99% Rotten Tomatoes score overstated this film's excellence. Well, it didn't. This movie brought fear, insight and laughs at all the right moments. Perfect storytelling and perfect pacing. I suppose I can imagine someone not being entertained by this movie, but it would take a lot of effort. Especially in a packed and diverse theater like the one where I saw the movie.",9,15,29,27 December 2017
Room," Yes, you will sob. Watch it anyway.
","Well, I started crying no less than 4 times, so let's start there. And those moments were not about music crescendoes or powerful speeches. Nope. They were simple and profound moments. I just cared so deeply for the characters and the story that they punched me in the gut. This movie understood pace and silence more than any film I've seen this year. The audience rediscovers the world alongside Jack...and we find it to be a scary but also beautiful place. We can barely take it in. And so can he. Brie Larson is great, but that kid nailed it. Just wow.",10,0,1,27 December 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," Wasted actors and ideas
","There are some fundamental problems with prequels: certain later events stop making sense, the non-stop reference to other films weigh things down. It is a long list. But this movie has ALL those problems. There is ZERO character development, just lots of winks and nudges about previous movies in the franchise. Actors like Isaac and Fasbender are wasted. Villains' motivations never make sense (let alone their powers). It is just a mess. 'First Class' showed so much promise, but this one did not deliver.",2,1,3,27 December 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Almost...but not quite.
","There were some great moments, concepts and even performances buried in there. But they were buried...by the additional villains, by the uneven storytelling. Much like the first, I found myself loving it one moment and then hating it the next. There's more potential here than in the first trilogy, but there are more glaring flaws too.",5,0,1,26 December 2017
Ex Machina," Completely enthralling...for a while
","For the first 2/3 of this film, I was so enthralled. The mood. The concept. The acting. Everything pulled you into interesting questions. And then the climax happened and the movie - well - devolved. It was still worth seeing, but the wheels came off just a tad.",7,3,5,26 December 2017
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Another beautiful Miyazaki film
","Seriously, though: how did Miyazaki do it? So much originality. So much humor. So much commentary. So much action. This movie was made in 1984! While it was not my favorite Ghibli flick, it was fantastic nonetheless. Other than some awkward inner monologues at the outset, this was a post-nuclear wasteland film that really worked at both a character and symbolic level.",8,0,0,27 December 2017
Hidden Figures," Transcends the 'true story' genre
","There's basically an entire genre called 'based on a true story'...those movies that inspire (and emotionally manipulate) you to cheer for things that already happened. This film may not transcend the genre, but it sure as hell nails it. The story flows, the characters work and the rhythms are not entirely predictable. I found myself misty at points, and watching with my daughter is a moment I will not soon forget. It may not win best picture, but I'm so grateful it is winning the box office.",8,0,3,27 December 2017
Coco," Not just brilliant - beautiful
","Pixar has always been humorous and insightful and innovative...but I'm not sure their previous stories have ever been this breathtakingly beautiful. There were elements of other movies mixed in (Back To The Future, Home Alone), but it was something special - a touching tribute to family and Mexico and music. Not only were the visuals amazing, but we could literally hear people around us whispering, 'That's just like my grandma!' Every character worked, and every part of the story fit into a beautiful portrait of Dia De Los Muertos. I cannot wait to see it again.",9,0,3,27 December 2017
1917," Roger Deakins is a god.
","I went into this movie wondering why we possibly needed another war film. It is a fair question, especially since this movie does not really bother with deeper philosophical examinations of war, and the story is a bit cliche at points. But Mendes and Deakins accomplished something truly different - I felt like I was in the trenches with the characters, and the journey was absolutely riveting. From the very first moment, the story grabbed me and barely let me breathe. I walked out ready for a drink and a nap. I also have zero idea how they made this movie (the camera shots defied all laws of physics). That said, I am glad they did.",8,9,13,18 January 2020
Sing Street," A movie about becoming
","This movie could have failed SO hard. It could have felt cliche or teen movie-ish or like it was trying too hard. But Carney somehow captures the magic again. The story feels fresh, and the characters feel real. Every time the band changed style and sound, I thought 'yes.' Because the movie chose not to be about arriving somehow...but about becoming. About trying. About failing. That is where 'Begin Again' faltered, honestly. And that real-ness allowed the predictable moments here to be not just forgiven but embraced. As the music gelled and the people connected, you just had to cheer.",9,1,1,27 December 2017
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Genius
","I watched this film because (a) I wondered whether my kids were ready, (b) I had somehow never seen it myself. Verdict? Total genius. Tim Burton movies have tended to be all vibe/aesthetic and no plot, but this one was JUST right. The perfect combo.",9,1,1,27 December 2017
Big Hero 6," A fun (if formulaic) ride
","The best animated movie I've seen this year, and the best super hero movie I've seen this year also. Inventive storytelling, fun characters and a ton of creativity. It's a bit too formulaic and action-y at the end, but that's forgivable. A fun ride.",8,1,2,26 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Don't trust the critics...or the fans
","Well, I may not have loved this movie as much as many critics...but I did not hate this movie nearly as much as many fans either. There were moments that really worked: arguments over destiny, epic lightsaber battles, and some plot misdirections that kept you guessing. More than anything, there were some cool risks that paid off with some of the most memorable moments in the franchise's history. But in between the humor often felt forced and the twists often felt too convenient. Long story short: there was a movie in there I liked (Rey's journey of discovery) even if there was a movie I liked less (Finn's adventures across unnecessary sub-plots). Even the best Star Wars movies have some flaws.",7,1,4,27 December 2017
Ip Man," So that Donnie Yen is something
","The action is jaw dropping. The film is beautiful. The protagonist is compelling. But this movie kinda reminded me of Rocky IV...except this time the Russians were the Japanese. So it was really exceptional Chinese propaganda, but it was still kinda Chinese propaganda. That said, if someone told me they were interested in a martial arts film, I would not hesitate to recommend.",7,0,0,27 December 2017
Jurassic World," Another remake, but that's not all bad
","Perhaps someday we will genetically recreate dinosaurs, but - in the meantime - we can simply recreate Spielberg films. The cute kids from a broken home. The speeches about nature finding a way. Clearly, you have seen this movie before. But it is still totally entertaining 20 years later, and Chris Pratt is totally becoming an unlikely movie star. I would not say the movie is 'good,' but it ain't bad.",6,0,0,27 December 2017
Logan," A superhero free from franchise
","Well, it only took Hugh Jackman 9 times playing Wolverine to make a truly great comic book film that can stand on its own. Of course, it required stripping away all the trappings: the continuity, the characters. This was not a franchise, but a story. And it worked because of that fact. A few complex characters on a conflict-filled adventure. Just the basics. I could have lived without some over-the-top moments at the end, but otherwise this movie was just plain brilliant from the beginning. Here's hoping they wait a while before the inevitable reboot.",8,1,3,27 December 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Avengers Too
","Second movies are supposed to be better (see X2, Dark Knight, etc.): less origin, more action. But this was really Avengers Too. Too many characters/subplots, too many Joss one-liners, too many cliches, too many sanctimonious moments. It was fine, but Marvel's universe sometimes seems to be collapsing under its own weight. Sometimes simple is better, and this was anything but simple.",5,0,0,26 December 2017
Midsommar," Not for everyone, but definitely unique
","So I am not big on 'horror' movies, but this film felt different to me. There are several reasons for that. First, the film took its time - by the time these characters got to Sweden, you knew who they were, who they were becoming, and what fears they needed to face. There is a ton of stillness here, and it works. Second, while there were some fairly gruesome moments, the story focused less on making you jump and more on building an increasingly bizarre and creepy world. Third, Florence Pugh absolutely blew me away. Would I watch it again? Hard pass. But this film wanted to be more than just another scary movie, and it mostly succeeded. It may not work for everyone, but it sure was ambitious.",7,5,7,19 January 2020
Selma," Powerful impact, at moments
","Selma starts off like a bio pic...before finally finding its groove in the little moments: a a diner, coroner's waiting area, a car ride. The movie captures just how many lives and conversations it took to create change. There are parts of the storytelling that are familiar (almost cliche), but the overall impact is powerful. It's a civil rights story told from the people that were oppressed and rose up.",8,1,2,26 December 2017
La La Land," Not a review of Moonlight. Ha!
","This film was a lovely and delightful riff on classic Hollywood musical romances. Was it the best picture of the year? Of course not. But nobody walking into this movie cold - no reviews, no context - could not smile. My only complaint was that I wanted more of Gosling and Stone just talking. Not dancing. Not singing. Just bantering. Those were the moments when I was most charmed and amused...and they were a bit too few and far between.",8,0,1,27 December 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Save yourself some time and watch the cartoon
","This film was pretty well done and well acted, but I have to ask: 'Why?' Why do they keep remaking Disney classics as live action films? Why do they add songs or scenes so the movies become longer than 2 hours? I guess there's nothing wrong with this version of the story, but I prefer the original...both because I like cartoons more than bad CGI and because it was 45 minutes shorter.",6,0,1,26 May 2019
Sicario," Plenty of intensity, but less nuance
","Intensity? Check. Performances? Check. Nuance? Not so much. Granted, 2/3 ain't bad. This drug war movie was highly watchable. If 'traffic' told, this film showed. And it captures the pointless anarchy of it all beautifully and suspensefully. But the characters felt like cardboard cutouts, and the morality a tad too cliche. Worth watching, but not re-watching.",7,0,0,27 December 2017
Inside Man," One word review: DENZEL
","I revisited this movie one decade later for two reasons:
1) Spike Lee
2) Netflix
It is indeed an incredibly well done heist film. The characters are almost all believable. The performances are solid. The plot twists are a little too neat, but enough to keep you guessing. And the pacing is just about perfect. But far and away the biggest stand out is Denzel. I had completely forgotten how he could transform an average detective role in a standard heist movie into an epic performance. He dominated every single scene and moment, and he reminded me that great actors are not defined by what they do with truly great roles. Great actors are defined by when they make average roles transcendent. I see you, Mr Washington. Bravo.",8,0,0,19 June 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," It almost worked
","So this sequel - like many others - was a bit too much of everything. Too many characters, too many random deaths, too much 70s music, too many overt references to family, and WAY too much green screen. But the characters and humor still saved it, honestly. I laughed out loud throughout, and I still cared thanks to Rocket, Drax, Peter, and crew. If every cliche over the top sequel was this good, I'd be ok with it.",6,1,2,27 December 2017
Castle in the Sky," Don't bother with Avatar when this is avaiable
","I have seen plenty of animated movies since the late 80s, but very few stand up to this film's originality and adventurousness. And why stop at animated movies? I mean, 'Avatar' is fine and everything, but I'll take this. Miyazaki has a unique gift for storytelling (and characters). Watching movies like this with my kids has been a gift.",9,0,0,27 December 2017
The Shape of Water," Beautiful and enchanting
","Only Guillermo Del Toro could pitch, 'It's a monster romance picture that feels like Free Willy meets Amelie in the Cold War era.' But you know what? It works...mostly. (You know, other than the central romantic relationship.) Regardless, it is absolutely beautiful and enchanting. There were points where I felt like this story tried a wee bit too hard, but it never strayed far from what it was. It was an un-apologetically monster fairy tale. If you want it to be something else, you will be disappointed. If you let it be what it is, you will enjoy every minute.",7,50,98,15 January 2018
American Made," So. Darn. Watchable.
","When I suggested to my wife that we watch this film, she was skeptical. Tom Cruise in a 'based on a true story' movie about the 1980s CIA and drug trade? Really? But here's the thing: Liman has such a great sense of how to use Cruise and how to tell a story like this. The plot starts quickly and keeps rolling. The tone/approach was just light and nostalgic enough to maintain balance between dark and entertaining. The protagonist seems both morally questionable and highly likable from moment one because - well - it is Cruise. There's a fair amount of fluff here, but it is hard not to enjoy the fluff. And even harder to resist Googling afterwards to confirm that this bizarre story had more truth than we might want to admit.",7,0,1,14 July 2018
Steve Jobs," The biopic, reimagined
","Aaron. Sorkin. How this film bombed I will never fully understand. Bio pics rarely work. Where to start? Where to finish? But this structure and storytelling turned it all upside down. In each act, you knew why you were there. You knew what each character wanted. Sorkin and Boyle liberated themselves from chronology, and art finally imitated life as a result. Oh, and every actor NAILED IT. This film reminded me that storytelling matters. Because even Steve Jobs can be boring (Um, hi Ashton.) or brilliant. This time? It was the latter",9,0,0,27 December 2017
Mudbound," Perspective changes everything
","Perspective changes everything. I have seen films like 'Mudbound' before, but never THIS exact story. The characters were all flawed, complex, and human. And somehow each person owned this tale. It is not easy to construct a film with 5-10 protagonists that delves into relationship, history, and justice. They managed to do just that. I could quibble about the pacing (slow) or the sub-plots (some felt superfluous), but the movie remains a feat nonetheless.",8,4,10,27 December 2017
12 Years a Slave," Absolutely devastating
","Absolutely devastating. There are important stories, and then there are important stories told flawlessly. This is the latter. This movie wrecked me, and I am forever grateful.",10,0,1,26 December 2017
Joker," A little original, a little derivative, a lot disturbing, and TOTALLY well done
","One could argue this film is original (because it finds new perspectives on the most familiar of characters and stories) or one could argue this movie is derivative (because it basically just mashed up a Batman villain and Taxi Driver). Personally, I think most art mixes up familiar elements to make something new, from DJs to filmmakers. And the new thing that Phillips creates here is incredibly well done and evocative. It is not easy to make something that is so familiar and so new all at once. It is not easy to make a film that both comments on mental illness in society and re-tells Batman's origins for the umpteenth time. Not that long ago Logan reminded audiences that comics could still make great art when freed from the burdens of franchise/universe building...but I'm still glad that Joker reminded us again.",7,0,1,8 November 2019
Edge of Tomorrow," It just works
","Cliche at first (like Groundhog's Day meets Aliens), but the movie works eventually. Mostly because Cruise is still a movie star and Lyman is still a capable storyteller. It grew on me.",7,0,2,26 December 2017
Whiplash," Unrealistic, unapologetic, and absolutely entrancing
",Are the two most dangerous words in the English language 'good job?' Is greatness worth the price/push? That's what Whiplash asks. It does so in a pretty cheesy and unrealistic fashion. It fails. It falls. But it tries and will not apologize for it.,7,0,0,26 December 2017
"Hail, Caesar!"," Not the best Coen brothers ever, but still enjoyable
","The Coen brothers transcend genre, from noir to thriller to dark comedy, they can nail it. But I particularly enjoy their takes on farce (especially when George Clooney is involved). This movie is not perfect, but I laughed out loud throughout, particularly when everyone embraced the silliness of the story as part of the whole point. It may not be the Coen brothers' best ever, but it doesn't have to be to be enjoyable.",7,0,0,27 December 2017
Finding Dory," A sequel that worked...but not well enough
","Perhaps it is unfair to compare any movie to 'Finding Nemo,' even its sequel. The heavy reliance on flashbacks and homages to the first film really hampered this story, especially over a sluggish first act. There was definitely momentum, though, all the way to a (second) funny and fantastic finale. I laughed out loud throughout. Sequels rarely live up to their predecessors - and this film is no exception - but it did work, thanks in part to great performances and the usual Pixar creativity.",7,0,1,27 December 2017
Arrival," A rare feat
","There have been SO many alien arrival movies. What more could this one offer, right? How about more humanity? This film never tried too hard (at the suspense, at the emotion, at the philosophy)...it showed and never told. And by the end I was blown away. Every element (cinematography, acting, score) worked together, and this movie somehow managed to be a sparse and character driven story that asked big questions...and happened to be about aliens. A rare feat indeed.",9,0,1,27 December 2017
Parasite," Goes bigger by going smaller
","Bong Joo Ho has been making ingenious social commentary for some time. That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think 'masterpiece' is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon.",10,19,30,4 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," All the things in one brilliant story
","It's Hollywood satire. It's tragicomedy. It's art turned inside out. It's character study. It's a giant inside joke. It's a reflection on meaning, parenthood, popularity, love, relationship and truth. But - most amazingly - it is exceptionally good at being all those things. Birdman is different than anything Inarritu has done before, and in a good way. Brilliantly conceived, brilliantly shot, brilliantly scored, brilliantly acted...just plain brilliant.",9,1,2,26 December 2017
The Big Short," Innovative and interesting, but hardly pefect
","If this book's charge was difficult (translate the entire financial crisis through a few compelling characters), the film's charge may have been tougher (translate the entire financial crisis into 2 hours of pop entertainment). I give the movie bonus points for innovation and acting. The complete tear down of the 4th wall was bold, and the performances by Bale and Carrell were fantastic. BUT there are downsides to the approach. In this case, Every wink wink nudge nudge moment kept me a little more distant. And the moral arc suffered as a result. It was a pop film with a conscience, but - if you want a financial crisis movie - go see Margin Call.",7,0,1,27 December 2017
Wonder Woman," Splash + Clash of the Titans x Captain America = Wonder Woman

Marriage Story," Humans, at their best and worst
","It is NOT easy to make a film about divorce that is funny and generous and touching as it breaks your heart. But clearly it is possible - this movie proves it. This is Baumbach at his absolute BEST (and most honest). The performances and direction are both great, but it is the writing that really steals the show. All these characters are so human, in the best and worst ways. That can make watching hard, but it makes it a joy too. Even as you watch the legal system attempt to swallow up a family, you never stop seeing yourself and you never stop caring. It is absolutely beautiful.",9,5,8,8 December 2019
Straight Outta Compton," Better than your average music biopic (but still a music biopic)
","Better than your average music biopic...but still a music biopic. The story felt uniquely relevant to 2015, partly because the director skillfully used police brutality, partly because the music felt fresh and partly because the performances were solid across the board. But the plot still felt scattered and long-ish; also, Easy E's coughing fits were representative of some TV movie tendencies (VH1 perhaps?). The film overcame those faults. But it was good, not great.",7,0,1,27 December 2017
Black Panther," A great comic book movie, and a great movie period.
","As a comic book movie, Black Panther represents a rare feat - something that stands on its own without franchise tie-ins or guest heroes, something that works as both drama and adventure without going too dark, something that manages to be about something without ever slowing down. I could have complained about the plot's predictability...but I was too damn busy enjoying it. As a social moment, Black Panther represents something pretty unique too. Not to overstate things, but I have literally never been to a movie theater with this much palpable energy and anticipation. The whole place was ready and waiting for a different kind of superhero movie. But even with ALL the hype, the movie managed to surpass expectations. Put simply: this film was special.",9,12,34,19 February 2018
Creed II," Rocky IV, Part II
","This was basically Rocky 4, Part 2. The good news: it was better than the first Rocky 4. The bad news: it was NOT better than the first Creed. Still, it was entertaining enough. A well made silly franchise movie is a well made movie nonetheless. The cast is great and the direction is solid. So even though I knew every single plot point instinctively, even though I laughed audibly at points and rolled my eyes at others...I still got into it. I still cared. It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful either. Creed somehow reinvented Rocky, and Creed 2 for some reason impersonated Rocky 4. Both were pretty fun to watch, in their own ways.",6,0,1,3 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," At least it was better than Man Of Steel?
","Zack Snyder's reputation is pretty solidly established at this point: great at montages, violence and aesthetics...but bad at storytelling (and subtlety). This movie actually worked for the first 90 minutes. The ingredients were there, from Zimmer to solid performances to a slow burning plot. But then Snyder's attempt to pull everything together just plain failed. Characters stopped acting logically, the story stopped making sense and we reverted back to rampant destruction again. It is tough to care about stories/characters that feel like they are being fast forwarded; then again, a super hero movie should not require 3.5 hours. Better than Man Of Steel, though!",3,0,6,27 December 2017
Saving Mr. Banks," Well done, but not entertaining
","Kinda like a really long Mad Men episode with a more recognizable cast, a peppier soundtrack, worse flashbacks and less historical accuracy. Well done? Yeah. Entertaining? Meh.",3,2,4,27 December 2017
Jojo Rabbit," A case for questioning assumptions
","I was slightly skeptical about this film. Another movie about Nazis? Another comedic take on the Holocaust? (By the Thor Ragnarok guy?) We have been here and done that, after all. But I was wrong. This movie was about Nazis to a certain extent, but it was more about what it means to be born and raised within a worldview only to realize something's off. Jojo's journey starts when he meets someone who defies his expectations and causes him to question everything. I would argue that's where most journeys start. And this film managed to capture that while also making the audience laugh and think and feel tense all at once. It was a historical film that transcended its genre and time period. Sometimes revisiting the familiar allows you to find something entirely new...and worthwhile.",8,0,0,7 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Recycled, nostalgic, and not half bad
","JJ Abrams is really good at this: recycle the plot, reconfigure the characters and let the action take center stage. It is a simple formula, and it mostly works here. Despite basically being a remake of the first Star Wars - from the plot to the characters - this story feels fresh and fun most of the time. Part of that's performances, but most of it is Abrams' sense of pace: more action, less trade policy. The flaws from the original trilogy are all here, especially the plot holes. But it is hard to notice them when you are having fun reliving the movies of your youth. There are some eye rolls, but I'll take this over the prequels any day.",7,0,5,27 December 2017
Deadpool," Wildly entertaining. I'm just not sure where superhero movies go from here
","'Wildly entertaining' is a fair summary, really. But here's the thing: dialing up the cartoon violence or infantile humor or detached irony has a downside. This movie spends so much time winking at the camera and making fun of itself that you start to wonder why you are even watching. It's as masturbatory as the jokes themselves. Granted, you remember why you are there every time you laugh your ass off (which happens frequently). But I'm not sure where this franchise or superhero movies in general go from here. At some point, storytellers have to care if they want audiences to care. Still...I'd watch it again in a heartbeat.",7,0,0,27 December 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Entertaining (and shallow) as hell
","Entertaining as hell. Nothing especially new (unlikely heroes, amazing secret clubs, super slow mo sequences, self referential jokes), but all the old tricks were used well at least. Would have loved a more diverse cast, but I suppose aristocratic British tailors are limited as protagonists.",6,1,2,26 December 2017
Da 5 Bloods," Historical, current, and timeless all at once
","Only Spike could make this film...and it is his best in a LONG time. He somehow combines a little Treasure of the Sierra Madre, a little Three Kings, and a lot of Marvin Gaye into an outright masterpiece. Not only that, but along the way he reminds us how many of our greatest supporting actors (Delroy Lindo, Clarke Peters, Isiah Whitlock Jr) could have been absolute stars in a parallel universe. The entire film feels so original and so familiar, which is not easy to pull off. When you are in Vietnam, you are transported to another era and place. When you are with these characters, you are reminded of the current moment. And yet it is timeless all the same. There have not been many films this year, but this was a reminder of what great stories can do. Let's have an Oscar ceremony just for Spike and Delroy Lindo. It will be well deserved.",9,8,23,13 June 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Not bad. Not bad at all.
","Since watching the first John Wick, I have learned that: (a) the genre can best be described as 'gun fu', (b) a college classmate of mine wrote these films. Interesting notes. As for chapter 2, the script remains smartly sparse and perfectly paced. It lacks the heart/backstory of the origin tale, but still feels like pure (and disciplined) adrenaline 90% of the time. The world is claustrophobic and well rendered, unlike similar films in the comic book category. I'll take that: simple, contained, and brutal. No superfluous characters or plot lines...Just vendettas and violence.",7,0,1,27 December 2017
Annihilation," Beautiful, terrifying, and more than a little derivative.
","Alex Garland created a truly unique aesthetic with this film, a world that feels beautiful, terrifying, and ever-evolving - it was hard to take your eyes off of it. Unfortunately, the story within that world felt awfully derivative, like a cross between Predator, Sphere, and a million other 'some scientists/soldiers face an existential threat' stories. While the movie was very well done, I found myself wishing the story (and its final conclusion) had been as evocative as the visuals.",5,1,5,2 March 2018
Incredibles 2," A sequel worth waiting for
","I have been quick to criticize Pixar's recent infatuation with sequels. We did not need another Cars or Monsters Inc, and we certainly did not need another Finding Nemo. I want them to tell original stories...not recycle old ones. And this one is a tad predictable and old fashioned. But you know what? It is hard to criticize sequels when they are THIS good. It would have been so easy to make the second Incredibles an action-fest of family crime fighting, but this movie managed to remember what made the first film so great: fully realized characters and one of the most realistic family dynamics ever captured on screen. From the marital tensions to the sibling bickering, you know these people. And the writing is JUST as strong this time around. It means you care, and it means you recognize yourself, and it means you laugh. This film is not about new villains so much as it is about new angles on rich characters. Fifteen years after the first Incredibles, we are awash with super hero movies. Sometimes it seems like they are all Hollywood cares about. But few of them are this good. Pixar nailed it the first time around, and this sequel absolutely nailed it too.",7,1,5,17 June 2018
Spectre," An unfortunate letdown after Skyfall
","Considering that Skyfall was my favorite Bond film EVER, I had high hopes for the next chapter. Meh. Sure, it was absolutely gorgeous, but it felt stale this time around. All Bond films are fairly formulaic; the very best play with those conventions and tell real stories. Spectre was not up to that standard, and it missed Dench desperately. The whole thing felt like a prettier version of a Roger Moore Bond movie, and I wanted more than that.",6,1,6,27 December 2017
Joy," Less than the sum of its parts
","Russell's films have always teetered between eccentricity and storytelling, but the balance was off here. There's a compelling protagonist and plot, but somehow we're spending all our time on random conversations with quirky supporting characters. The humor and soundtrack say Russell, but the flow is missing. Lawrence (and the cast) almost make it work...almost. But I never really managed to care. That's not about the substance; that's about the storytelling.",5,0,2,27 December 2017
The Nice Guys," If only summer movies looked more like this in 2016
","Somebody probably pitched this as LA Confidential meets Boogie Nights meets Lethal Weapom meets the Marx brothers. And you know what? Sign me up. Black was the perfect director for this film, and Gosling/Crowe gave the perfect performances. I laughed out loud. A lot. More stories like this and less comic book movies, please.",8,0,1,27 December 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Summer action, at its best
","This film felt like the full realization of George Miller's original post-apocalyptic vision, from aesthetics to adrenaline. If anything, it improved on the formula, adding a dash of mystery and caper along with all the effects that are now possible in 2015. And the extra dose of feminism did not hurt either. If you want a great summer action movie, this is it.",8,1,3,26 December 2017
The Social Network," A semi-accurate history, but a transcendent movie
","When I first saw this film in 2010, I definitely recognized Sorkin's brilliance and Fincher's craftsmanship (always)...but I kept getting distracted by accuracy questions. Why did they change Zuckerberg from socially awkward to the most confident and eloquent nerd ever? Why did they leave out his then-girlfriend and now-wife? How much of this story was true? Revisiting the movie in 2020 was very different (and not just because Zuckerberg feels more and more like Eisenberg these days). I was able to just watch it as a movie. This film tells a company's origin story through depositions and flashbacks. That should not work. But it does. From Resnor's score ramping up the intensity to the brilliant pacing/cuts to the pitch perfect performances of Sorkin's dialogue, this story just cooks. No matter where you come in, you HAVE to keep watching. And for once Sorkin's resists explaining his theme through speeches over and over. You just see the way connection and isolation coexist, for the main character and honestly for yourself. It is all pretty brilliant, and it was worth a second watch, for sure. Is it accurate? Somewhat. Is it a great film? One hundred percent.",9,0,0,31 May 2020
The Martian," Captures the excitement, humor, and humanity of the book
","Full disclosure: I read (and enjoyed) this book. So I'm going to be one of those people who says 'They got this right, but they got this wrong.' Bottom line, though, they adapted this REALLY well. Scott captured what survival and problem solving looks like, and managed all the excitement/humor/humanity that made the book great. I would have loved a little more explanation and a little less self-seriousness, but there's no way not to enjoy this ride.",8,0,1,27 December 2017
