The Monuments Men," Unbelievably bad
","Not one redeeming moment in this film. Bad writing, bad acting, bad directing. The story is so poorly executed that you don't know what is going on or care about the characters. Lots of speechifying about preserving culture and how awful Hitler is. But not one shred of conviction or passion. Bill Murray's attempts at humor are painful to watch. George Clooney is one of the writers on an adapted screenplay. Two things are apparent:1. Clooney should stick to acting. 2. The author of the book on which this is based must be weeping. 2. Let me repeat. Clooney should stick to acting. How do you put Cate Blanchett, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray and John Goodman on screen together and get this movie?",1,2,2,23 January 2015
