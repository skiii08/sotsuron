Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Very good film, although not as good as Vol. 1
","I have to say that this movie is none which I'd like to see again very soon, because it's a lot more melancholic and sad than vol. 1. But I really enjoyed it. I think Tarantino just cut ACTION and STORYTELLING into two parts, two movies, which i find a good idea. I don't know how he would have managed to achieve an effect like that if he wouldn't have been told to do it in two movies by Miramax. There will be many people telling me that Vol.2 sucks in comparison to Vol.1, i know that, although i was one of the first to see it in Salzburg. I won't answer them, i couldn't describe what i liked about it so much. I guess it's just Tarantino :)",Null,1,3,22 April 2004
