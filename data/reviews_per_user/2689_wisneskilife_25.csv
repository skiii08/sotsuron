The Lobster," Absolutely Delightful
","The Lobster is beautiful and sickening. The tone is awkward for the vast majority of the movie and that makes it so much fun to watch. There's a killer cast that plays each role perfectly and the story is to die for. Please, please, PLEASE see The Lobster as soon as possible. I cannot recommend it enough. It'll be the greatest 'weird' film you'll ever see.",9,2,5,5 September 2018
The New World," Pick Another Moive
","Don't waste your time. I'm not sure there's a beginning, middle, end, rising action, falling action, or climax during this movie. Just go ahead and watch whatever your other option for the night is. Because no one should watch a couple of grown men pursue a minor for the entire movie.",5,0,0,24 August 2018
Requiem for a Dream," Heartbreaking
","I've never felt so much disparity after watching a movie. Requiem for a Dream tells the tale of four very different drug addicts. Throughout the movie they experience ups and downs until each one hits rock bottom. I'm not sure who experiences the worst possible ending. All I know is Requiem for a Dream is the saddest, most perfect piece of art I've seen in a long time.",9,1,1,3 December 2018
Friday Night Lights," One Thumb Up
","Friday Night Lights is a good movie and a classic for sure. It's just not as good as Remember the Titans or Rudy. It's got a great early-2000s nostalgic feel though. Love the camera angles, love the actors, and love the entire feel. A groovy movie to watch on a Friday night.",7,2,3,29 November 2018
Green Room," High Hopes -Low Satisfaction
","For the number of famous people in Green Room, I was expecting a better story. It's really just another horror movie that's really not that scary. The repetitiveness is agonizing. We get it; try to escape, fail, someone dies, back to the green room, repeat for an hour and a half. Plus the plot twist that ties it all together was more like a plot hole. I would only recommend this if you had nothing else to watch.",5,4,7,27 November 2018
Us," Twilight Zone Preview
","Get Out was obviously a masterpiece and Us is almost to the same masterpiece level. Ultimately, the quasi-dystopian horror movie is more creepy than scary. I just felt uncomfortable the entire time waiting for what would happen next. Us is, of course, filled with gore and pretty shots. But the real money maker is the plot. The entire plot is a great foreshadowing for what the new Twilight Zone will be like. Admittedly, the beginning is a little slow, but once Us picks up, it never slows down. The only reason I can't give Us a 10/10 is because of the plot twist in the last thirty seconds. It was cheesy and unnecessary. I would definitely see Us again in theaters and I'll buy it immediately when it comes to DVD.",9,3,12,22 March 2019
Closer," Absolutely Bonkers
","The first few scenes of Closer are slow and seem overly sexual. But hold on, because everything afterwards is just one giant climax. The back and forth of love and betrayal is so juicy. Plus, the ending is just off the wall insane. Would watch over and over again; just not with my parents.",9,1,2,3 January 2019
Remember the Titans," Doesn't Need a Review
","It's no secret that Remember the Titans gives everyone goosebumps. Granted, there's a lot of historical inaccuracies. But who cares? It's awesome! If you don't get a shiver down your spine when the defense shouts, 'LEFT SIDE, STRONG SIDE' you're not human. Just go ahead and watch this for the 15,000th time.",8,2,4,3 November 2018
It Follows," Didn't Have Sex for Weeks
","Is it a movie about the dangers of sex or a movie about the harsh reality of growing up? I'm not sure, but it scared me half to death. Obvious It Follows is a horror movie, but there's something about the gentle filter, specific camera angles, and eerie tone that just make it seem much more than just another scary B film.",9,2,4,24 July 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Lackluster
","Let me start off by saying, scenes from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood are really quite great, but as a whole, the film is just seriously lacking in depth. This is easily Tarantino's most underwhelming film. About halfway through, I realized this isn't a piece of historical fiction that was going to graphically display the Sharon Tate murder. But instead, was actually an alternative reality about 'what might've happened' mixed with this awkward 'what the real life of Hollywood stars is like'. Which made for an awkward movie-going experience. All criticism aside, the ending was fantastic. I'll sound like a sadist for a second, but Tarantino is known for his graphic and violent scenes, and I got just a small taste of that. However, I think Tarantino would have done a much better job showing the Manson followers slaughtering Sharon Tate and her guests. I suspect he didn't do that because he didn't want to be predictable. Ultimately, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood left me upset that I paid money to see it. Even worse, the guy behind me in the theater fell asleep. I think his response is a pretty accurate summary of what the entire film experience was like.",5,11,26,28 July 2019
Garden State," Genius
",What I wouldn't give to be a fly on the wall for the writing and filming of Garden State. Zach Braff is a creative genius who wrote and directed this masterpiece. Something about laughing through genuine human sadness makes you feel better. Natalie Portman and Braff made for an idyllic couple and I loved imagining all the possibilities of future stories after the ending.,10,0,0,23 July 2018
Prisoners," Intense, but Ultimately Dull
","Let's get a few things clear immediately, the ending of Prisoners is 10/10 out of this world. Hugh Jackman and Paul Dano give amazing performances and the plot twist just had my jaw on the floor. However, for 2.5 hours, I felt like I deserved more. The idea of the plot was more exciting than the execution. The build up is slow, and hard to justify the wait. This isn't to say Prisoners is an awful movie, I just thought thought it could have been better.",7,0,0,14 April 2019
Silence," Snooze Fest
","It wasn't the worst movie, but for being such a violent movie, I thought it was absolutely boring. The plot is almost interesting, the characters are kind of neat, but oh my gosh, I struggled to keep my eyes open. Silence could have been a great movie, but was ultimately executed and produced poorly.",6,2,4,24 August 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Crushing
","If you could delete an ex from your memory, would you? That's the entire premise of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. By the end, I honestly felt like a part of me died watching this. There was never a moment where I wasn't heart broken. Besides the story itself being incredible, there's an artsy feeling to the entire film. The subtle nuisances of the side characters is magical and casting was perfect. Probably one of the 10 best movies I've seen in my life.",10,0,1,17 August 2018
La La Land," Visually Appealing, but Boring
","Let's start off with all the absolutely incredible things about La La Land. It's probably one of the ten most visually appealing movies of all time. Every camera angle, every carefully planned twist and turn, is just beautiful. And duh, the music is 10/10 spectacular. The ending is also just out of this world, superb. Unfortunately, La La Land just takes too long to actually get decent. Emma Stone's character is so static and boring. Ryan Gosling is great and a version with just him could have been different. But ultimately, their romance is bland and cliche. I see what all the initial appeal was about, but now it just seems like La La Land will he forgotten in time.",7,0,0,14 March 2019
The Shape of Water," Awards Might've Been Unnecessary
","I love Guillermo del Toro and I love artsy movies, but at its core, The Shape of Water is really just a movie about a lady having sex with a fish man. As a romantic fantasy story, it's pretty cool, but I'm not convinced it deserved Best Picture. The ending is pretty solid, but the entire movie is slow paced and lacking any real thrill. This is not to say The Shape of Water is a bad movie, I just think it was over glorified.",7,1,1,18 December 2018
There Will Be Blood," I DRANK YOUR MILKSHAKE
","The entire movie is remarkable from start to finish. Even though it feels like a long, slow burn, the ending is worth every second of mental suffering. Daniel Day-Lewis is the greatest actor alive and should be remembered for this role, most certainly.",10,0,0,23 July 2018
Whiplash," Painful and Brilliant
","Truthfully, there really isn't a beginning, middle, or end in Whiplash. This is more a a philosophical journey with a ambitious artist and an even more ambitious teacher. There are dialogues and scene that are almost too painful to watch, but really make you think. J. K. Simmons is the perfect antihero (I wouldn't call him a villain). Simmons comes off as a terrible person, but really he's the push everyone needs in life to succeed. I know I reflected on all the negative people who affected my life and began to wonder if negative criticism is more powerful than positive criticism.",10,0,0,23 July 2018
Whiplash," Oscars for a Reason
","Whiplash won 3 Oscars for a reason; which is exactly why it's my all-time favorite movie. Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons are the only actors who could have orchestrated this masterpiece. Make no mistake, nothing really happens plot wise in Whiplash. The whole story is Andrew being broken down by Fletcher until they realize they're both the key to the other persons' success. But there's really not a concrete beginning, middle, and end. The last scene is the most epic moment in film history, and should be watched 100 times, but then the movie just ends. I make everyone watch Whiplash with me just so I can see their face when Fletcher does something terrible to a student. Absolutely incredible. Everyone who is strong enough, needs a Fletcher in their life. Go watch Whiplash now.",10,0,1,28 November 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Cut Out Your Eyes
","I can't believe someone put money into producing this movie. I should have hit myself with a hammer over and over again until I lost consciousness. Honestly, that would have been more enjoyable that paying to see this movie. Don't be me, pay for something else, or at least bring a hammer with you to put you out of your misery halfway through.",3,0,4,24 August 2018
Trainspotting," Top 10 Movie
","Trainspotting is one of the greatest movies of all time. How someone can film a tragic story, include comedy, character development, artsy scenes that make sense, and make it look good in under two hours is incredible to me. You've got people defecating themselves, people dying from HIV, you've got babies dying, underage sex, drugs overdoses, people betraying their friends for $16,000, and so much more. Trainspotting is the perfect movie.",10,1,3,1 December 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," Cutest Film Ever
","Moonrise Kingdom is the most perfectly put together piece of art. For an hour and a half, there's never a dull or slow moment. Each character is interesting whether you love or hate them. This is probably Wes Anderson's best work. It has all his key elements: pretty filter, beautiful camera angles, music to die for, dynamic characters, and a unique story that only he could create. I could keep this on replay in the background for the rest of my life.",9,3,4,24 December 2018
Heat," Legendary
","Movies aren't made like this anymore. Between an all-star cast, incredible character development, and dialogue you'll always remember, Heat is a movie you'll rank as one of the greatest. Heat is not a movie about the battle between cops and robbers; it's a movie about how virtually the same two people can find themselves struggling to maintain success at different ends of the spectrum. Being able to develop so many characters, without boring an audience is incredible to me. You won't be disappointed. Go ahead and buy two copies.",10,1,1,23 July 2018
Green Book," Winning Best Picture
","Green Book is so perfect it hurts. The story is pretty much dead on. The casting and dialogue couldn't possibly be any better. Green Book is winning an Academy Award for Best Picture for sure. I have no idea how someone could write a true story about racial tensions in the US during the 1960s and make it comical and cheerful, but it happened and it looked damn good. Amazing from start to finish.",8,2,4,23 November 2018
Macbeth," Incredibly Unique
",This version of Macbeth is is going to be shown in high schools for the next 20 years. Visually very pleasing and true to Shakespeare's play. I don't think it was received well in theatres because it's literally read like it just came out of a 10th grade English textbook. But there's no getting around that this is one of the prettiest movies I've ever seen. Casting was also spot on considering every second felt super spooky. I would recommend to a friend.,8,2,3,1 December 2018
