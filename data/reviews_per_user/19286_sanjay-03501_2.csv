Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Sacha Baron Cohen does it again!!
","This movies is a mixture of some good and some bad scenarios.You may either laugh out loud hearing his jokes or else will try breaking your screen with some over vulgar dialogues. Sometimes it looks as if this is the only thing Mr. Sacha does good.This danger-zone comedy has the tendency to offend some folks who feel certain subjects are not to be laughed at.But looking it as an enjoyable movie yes, it is really funny, plain and simple.Take it this way, Mr Sacha has pointed out America's few shortcomings and hateful ways in a refreshingly as well as utterly hilarious way.But i must say that with Borat, Mr. Baron Cohen took the same basic idea that had worked with Ali G or Dictator and pushed it hard, then harder.I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com .It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.",7,0,1,18 September 2016
Sully," A winner movie and very hopeful
","Tom Hanks has some kind of magic that we see in all his movies. The definition of the word HERO can be extracted after seeing this movie. This is now one of his masterpiece.Tom Hank has played his role almost without emotion but because of his interpersonal skills (the real Sully) this works out almost perfectly.Movies of this kind that are based on real life events have a grip on our mind which makes us watch the movie till the last minute and creates an impression on everyone who sees it.But the censor board giving an A rating which is a little strange thing. Otherwise a great thriller to watch with the whole family and never getting board. Tom Hanks does it again or i should say, Captain Philips does it again! Rocking!I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com . It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.",9,0,2,18 September 2016
