Changeling," Interesting, if not a simple, example of a mother's desperation...
","In 1928, Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), a single parent and working class woman in Los Angeles, leaves her son, Walter (Gattlin Grifith), at home to attend a last-minute work schedule. By the time she returns she discovers that Walter is missing and files a missing child's report. Over the next few months Christine attempts to search for her son by any means possible, yet the LAPD discover a stranded boy who they believe to be Walter. Upon being reunited with her son, Christine's joy turns to dismay as she discovers that the boy is not her son, even though he claims to be.Based upon true events the film automatically gains a shocking realism in conjunction to it's subject matter, which develops into a frightening case as the film progresses. What starts off as a simple case of a child going missing, turns into a complex matter of police incompetence and the desperate struggle of a mother. But this is not to say that the film flows from point to point without any hitches. While the first three quarters are intriguing to watch, especially with the addition of a hint of horror elements adding spice to the drama, the first half the film's final quarter drags the film to a standstill. The main reason for this is that by the time the last quarter starts, you'll already know how the film is going to end, even if you have no idea about the events on which the film is based. It's predictable what will happen to Walter, what becomes of Christine, and what becomes of the LAPD, but the film attempts to drag its run time by making these issues seem suspenseful. This falls directly within the film's major problem, the lack of ambiguity. From the very outset we know what Walter looks like ,and the boy claiming to be him later in the story only partially resembles him. Clint Eastwood never allows for the audience to question the integrity of Christine, such as many people at the time would have most likely done as well. The very chance to make the film more believable is never played upon.But beyond that there is very little to criticize the film except for the fact that Christine never really places any blame on herself for leaving her child alone in the house at a time when many children were going missing. It's a small thing, and her self-blame could be read into her actions, but it appears that she is too willing to blame outside factors and never really accept that she should have done more then just have the neighbours go over to check on Walter, which itself is never played upon because it is never stated whether the neighbours did or did not.Nevertheless, the acting which is top notch. Every major character does a great job of showcasing their respective character with realism. Angelina Jolie steals the show: her bodily expressions in conjunction with the pure veracity of her emotions and speech is breathtaking. When she is happy, Jolie has a glow to her; when she is desperate and angered at the loss of her child, Jolie is every inch the mother you would expect her to be. Jeffrey Donovan, as Captain Jones, is smug as he should be and annoyed at the constant plea from Christine. Michale Kelly comes across as interested and sympathetic as his character, Detective Ybarra, should have been when investigating the cases of missing children. If there is a little disappointment it would be John Malcovich as Reverend Briegleb, but not because he underachieves but because there is not enough screen time to allow Malcovich to really play with the role. He comes across as a little stifled, but this doesn't stop some good acting on his part.There is no sex, nudity and minimum language. Violence is kept for the latter half of the film but is performed in flashbacks, occur very quickly and the victim is off-screen, though that doesn't stop them being quite haunting.The Changeling is a good film, though not quite one of Eastwood's best. Yes the acting ensemble is really good, especially from Jolie, and there is an interesting plot. However this does not stop the film being predictable and not as suspenseful as it ought to be, and the main case of this is the lack of ambiguity. Everything in the Changeling is far too stated which, for the real life events themselves, was not the case.",7,2,4,27 February 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," On slowing tides...
","On the way to hopefully finding the fountain of youth, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) finds himself in a dire predicament when he is captured by his ex-lover Angelica (Penélope Cruz )and the nefarious Blackbeard (Ian McShane). They require Jack's help in finding the fountain in order to save Blackbeard while trying to avoid the clutches of Barbossa (Gerofery Rush).As a sequel to the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, On Stranger Tides attempts to refresh the series by concentrating on an uncomplicated narrative. Instead, the film takes a page out of the original film in the series but not quite as successfully. There are a few plots being weaved together but they all come up short in execution which ultimately threatens the potential of various associated characters. The core reason is due to the lack of detailed exposition. The most problematic of these is the love story between Philip (Sam Claflin) and the mermaid Syrena (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) which is evidently undeveloped and unimportant to the overall narrative. Their growing love lacks tangibility and it becomes frustrating when their conclusion becomes a guessing game for the audience. There are various plots developed but they are underwhelming and this hurts the film as the action sequences alone cannot stop the odd scene from dragging along. For the most part the film is a fun watch but just not a particularly great one.The acting is passable enough as Depp and Rush convey their characters in a similar fashion to older films. Cruz and McShane add positively to the cast with the former bringing some zest to the film while the latter does bring the expected arrogance to Blackbeard. Claflin and Berges-Frisbey are not able to be quite as convincing. However, this is mostly due to their limited capacity in the film, which comes from the limited nature of their respective plot on the overall narrative of the film. On Stranger Tides also sports a far less noticeable and capable supporting cast when compared to the original trilogy which is disappointing, so the chance to offset the major situations in the film to the lesser cast is next to impossible.There is an extensive use of CG throughout the film and predominately with good results. What is a strange decision is to have a large portion of the film shrouded in darkness. A lot of the film deals with enlightenment, either by faith or common humanity, but the filmmakers attempt to ensure you do not feel the same way as the lack of visibility can, at times, hinder the viewing experience.The film contains no sex though the mermaids are clearly naked even though nothing explicit is shown. Language is mild at best as it is more in the name-calling variant. Violence comes in a variety of forms but deaths are mostly tame.On Stranger Tides appears as a semi-reboot of the series, being more in liking with the original film and therefore losing the unnecessary scale At Worlds End attempted to provide. But the simplification has gone perhaps a little too far with a thin narrative and a thin cast of characters that ultimately fail to ignite. At its best, On Stranger Tides has everything that made the franchise good, but these moments are never frequent enough or long lasting making the film like spotting a mermaid: if you blink it will most likely be gone; and that just may well be a good thing.",6,0,0,10 June 2011
Mission: Impossible III," Mission: Successful...
","Mission: Impossible III covers the story of agent Ethan Hunt who has retired from IMF, in favour of settling down with his fiancée Julia. Hunt is recruited for another IMF operation, by Director Musgrave. Hunt initially refuses, but when he realises that his protégée, Lindsay Farris, has been kidnapped by Owen Davian, a black market arms dealer, Hunt gets himself wrapped up into a flurry of trouble.Mission: Impossible III begins in medias res, with Ethan and Julia, both tied up, and Davian who is threatening to kill Julia, if Ethan does not tell him where the 'rabbit's foot' is located. This torture scene definitely sets up the story to follow, and is in fact, one of the most intense scenes I have encountered in my cinema viewing. When the same scene is played again later in the movie, the abundant emotions you feel for Hunt and against Davian, absolutely overwhelm you.It's this sort of intensity when begins to fade during the movie, though not entirely. The action sequences are well filmed, but never become truly spectacular to the point where they are awe-inspiring. Strangely for a film of this kind, its the emotional impact which keeps the films alive. Acting is not Oscar-worthy, but Tom Cruise plays his part as Hunt, with a defined sense of cool: in the action sequences, one can see the determination which fills him. Yet, its Philip Seymour Hoffman, as the villain Owen Davian, who really steals the show. His coldness and sense of rationality, brings to life a villain who truly is malicious in his deeds.The soundtrack is riveting, and no one can forget the adrenaline pumping, Mission: Impossible theme. Sadly, a couple lame one-liners are apparent in the film, and really do feel out of place. Also, the ending is too quick without continuing the emotional journey of Hunt, yet the non-stop action coupled with the strength of the characters, makes Mission: Impossible III the best in the series.It's by no means a spectacular film, but Mission: Impossible III only goes to show, that no film is impossible to pull off, when all the right ingredients, fall into place.",7,0,1,6 August 2006
Skyfall," You only live twice...
","A computer drive containing the information of MI6 Agents planted in terrorist organisations has been stolen and Bond is tasked with recovering it. While on the mission, Bond is severely wounded and presumed dead, until months later when he returns after learning that MI6 itself has become the target of a bomb attack. Bond forces himself to return to active duty only to discover that not only are his skills as an agent have been impaired, but that M's life is in danger.It is both understandable though strangely perturbing that Skyfall is a standalone entry into the new era of Bond films. While continuity in the 007 history is all over the place, there is the situation that certain plot points, primarily that of the criminal organisation known as Quantum, should have surely been expanded upon. As it stands, there is little in reference to Bond's lover Vesper or Quantum, two important aspects in the shaping of James Bond (Daniel Craig) as a character, and it comes as a missed opportunity. Nevertheless, we are presented with a new villain, Silva (Javier Bardem), who has a a pretty hefty grudge against M (Judi Dench). Silva is definitely the most interesting Bond villain of recent years and is a highlight of the story, but his introduction comes a little later than expected but this is a minor issue. Skyfall's plot is an interesting one: what starts off as a hunt against a formidable villain turns into a retrospective of Bond. However, this latter point never feels fully developed, and can appear at times to be tacked on to further the length of the narrative.The integral point of interest in humanising Bond is his feeling of betrayal by M for her lack of confidence in him. And then it is over. Just like that. The development of Bond feeling jaded against is quelled as quickly as it arises. The strong emphasis on humanising Bond will either be interesting to you or distracting after how subtly this thematic element is convincingly explored in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Nonetheless, it is the film's identity which is most at crisis. Skyfall constantly switches between passé and new-age 007 that it fails to find or even stick to an identity for the sake of consistency. Bond is more believable in the modern adaptation but the film expects the audience to accept its questionable narrative logic for the sake of plot advancement. In past Bond films this would not be a problem but following Casino Royale, where plot advancement made some semblance of sense, in Skyfall this comes across as overreaching. Though there is no denying that the recent 007 films have all employed rather commendable performances from the entire cast, especially that of Daniel Craig who has provided a sense of concrete believability to the somewhat caricature nature of Bond. While Bond in Skyfall is much worse for wear than he has been, there is no denying that Craig does, at times, come off as far too stiff. This is a most noticeable when he has some quick words to spare upon someone, otherwise the forlorn act he presents can make you feel for him, though whether you choose to buy that is another matter. Judi Dench continues her stellar performance as M and its great to see how her role has matured from the Brosnan era to the Craig era, and with her added screen-time for Skyfall she definitely does not miss a beat. Rounding off the trio of important actors is Javier Bardem as Silva. Silva is a different type of villain compared to that seen in the previous two outings. He is one part happy-go-lucky, one part vindictive and all sociopath, but still you never quite feel as if you should be rooting against him. Bardem portrays a charm that really pushes his character to the forefront of almost every scene he is in, outpacing both Dench and Craig with little effort. It is a pity that his character does not appear more often in the plot. The rest of the cast are all noteworthy in their performances. Naomi Harris as the operative Eve, Ben Whishaw as the new Q and Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, Head of Intelligence and Security all do a great job.A welcomed change from Casino Royale, as echoed with Quantum of Solace, is the move towards a more diverse array of action sequences, such as vehicle chases. What makes the action that more effective are the locales themselves. There is a distinctiveness to the likes of Istanbul Shanghai, Macau, Gunkanjima Island, among others, that provide each action sequence is distinct personality. This is only made better by the fact that there are some great locale shots outside of Bond doing what he does best.As expected of a 007 film sexuality has its place but within moderation. Language usage is emphasised on the odd occasion while violence, in which there is quite a bit is never explicit.Skyfall is a fun film to watch. There is nothing that can deny this. Good acting, an interesting plot, an interesting villain; good action sequences and some lovely cinematography have the making for a top notch film. However, as interesting as Skyfall is to follow, its narrative caves within itself at points. The strange turn to humanise Bond about two-thirds through seems at play against what came before, and this itself is heavily played to the point that Bond himself begins to lose much of the intrigue that makes him who he is. Additionally, some plot advancements, like Silva's plan, do not get the attention the audience deserves in terms of understanding how it ultimately works. And lastly there is the dual identities the film attempts to balance, but that never feels like it really comes off. Bond is still doing what he does to be the world's super spy icon, but sometimes, maybe the world is not enough.",8,1,4,3 January 2013
Marie Antoinette," Dim lust...
","History has created many faces that will forever ordain the fabrics of time, be them famous or infamous. Such figures are popular themes for biographic movies, and while these figures were famed, their film portrayals do not always do them justice.Most people, regardless of whether they took History as a subject or not, know from the beginning some information on Marie Antoinette and her eventual downfall with the French revolution: Marie (Kirsten Dunst), Austrian born, leaves her country of birth to marry the prince of France; she would eventually become queen when the prince was crowned King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Marie was known as a queen who lived an exuberant life and was labeled as being insensitive towards the people of France.While a biography of sorts, Marie Antoinette is flawed with some historic inaccuracy, but for those who know little about Marie, or have forgotten, these inaccuracies will come as merely grains of dust which can be brushed away. As a whole, the film is effective with its storytelling, but there are certain issues that hinder the process.While setting off with a good start, Marie Antoinette continues in rather slow and mundane fashion. There is a certain mellowness in the atmosphere that never ever picks up pace, even when Marie begins living life to it's fullest; this is especially a problem when the slow pacing can be seen as metaphoric of Marie's lackluster life.On the acting side, we are presented with genuinely decent acting. None of the characters portray their respective characters poorly, granted some actresses need only be fickle with their character, and this proves a strong point of the film. The various actors and actresses do not bring about award winning performances but what they do bring forth, is a sense of ease.The film itself is a feast for the eyes. Sofia Coppola does an amazing job with her cinematography which not only helps us identify with the characters but also highlights the grandeur of the costume design and the royal splendidness of French architecture. However there is a stint in the movie which seems out of place in terms of camera facilitation, and it is very noticeable. Luckily Coppola finishes the film on a very artistic note, and it is easily one of the best scenes in the entirety of the film.Another very striking aspect of the movie is the inclusion of contemporary music. While there are the usual classical melodies associated with historically based films, the modernised tunes are wonderfully added to create new life within the context of the story. With this, one is able to relate various events within the story to modern day society, and this becomes a strong talking point of the film. However, the popular music becomes unnecessarily used in some scenes and ultimately a strength of the film, becomes its weakness.Rarely scattered throughout the film are various clippings of Marie being dressed and, while not fully visible, breast nudity can be seen. The film also plays on the low key love life Marie has with Louis and her eventual falling into an affair.Marie Antoinette is a lovely film to gaze upon with the costume design and the imagery of the majestic buildings of aristocrat France. Even the acting is good, but tit all falls apart throughout the course of this somewhat historically incorrect film. The slow pacing is nagging and the overuse of modern music makes Marie Antoinette more a bother then a style.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",6,1,1,22 March 2007
Kung Fu Panda," A strange, yet cute and fun approach to martial arts...
","Po (Jack Black), a clumsy Panda, works at a noodle restaurant, but as an avid kung fu fan he dreams of being able to meet The Furious Five, a group of kung fu experts noted for their great ability and heroic deeds. One day, it is decided that one of The Furious Five will be granted the status of the Dragon Warrior, and a determined Po attempts to watch the tournament taking place. After various attempts to enter the Dojo, he finally gets in, only to be told that he is the future Dragon Warrior.Kung Fu Panda is quite a unique story: it is a clear parody of kung fu films but it does enough to prove that it pays homage to them as well. For instance, Po is told he will become the greatest warrior in the whole of China, but he is both overweight and clumsy, and has no martial arts training whatsoever: parody. However, the old and wise kung fu master, Oogway (Randall Duk Kim), has some very wise words, infused in traditional Chinese philosophy: homage. This becomes the most striking aspect of the film, and one which will no doubt be more attune t adults then children. Though it must be said that the film is more for kids then adults, unlike previous DreamWorks Animation productions such as Shrek, Madagascar and Flushed Away. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the film as a whole. The film is ridden with clichés, sometimes to aid the comedy, and the comedy itself can be far too silly at times. The film is also too short, and characterization pays for this. Beyond Po and Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), no other characters really gets any depth added to them. There is a little for Tigress (Angelina Jolie), but that is about it, and it's disappointing because it is possible that each character has a rich background. The length also lessens the overall impact of the film, with Po seemingly able to learn Kung Fu is a very short space of time. In fact, there were times where I felt totally disengaged with the film, wondering when it was going to show something that truly excited me.But the action looks great, mostly due to the superb animation. Characters look like great representations of cartoons, and their body movements are fluid. There is also a great deal of detail, with much work being put into the fur of characters, and facial workings. Special effects do not appear to have gotten as much work on, but they are not bad at all, and work well with the other animation. DreamWorks Animation mus be commended for making a truly believable world and its clear to see references to other great martial arts films like House of Flying Daggers. If anything, its a shame that some good action sequences become used more to emphasis comedy then action, and makes the fighting less engaging then you would hope.Music is very consistent, bringing traditional Chinese melodies expected of kung fu movies to the helm. At all times, it works, unlike the voice acting. Now all the voice actors do an impeccable job illustrating their respective characters, be it Angelina Jolie as the fiery Tigress, Ian MacShane as the evil Tai Lang, and even Randall Duk Kim as the serene and wise Oogway. And while Jack Black does a good enough job as Po, he comes across as too Jack Black, and Po as a character feels lifeless. In fact, the problem with Black is that unlike the other actors, he brings no charisma to his role. By no means is he a bad actor, his last role in Be Kind Rewind was great, but this time around, he doesn't quite gel with his character.With unnoticeable tame language, and no sex or nudity, the film does have its fair share of violence. However it is far from being actually violent and is also used quite often for comical purposes.As far as computer animations go, Kung Fu Panda is good, but not good enough to truly compete with the forerunners of the medium. For every aspect which makes Kung Fu Panda worth watching, humour and animation quality, there are aspects which make not worth the watch, simplistic story and lack of character development. It does what it sets out to do and that is entertain, but it falls short of what it should have tried to accomplish.",6,3,9,17 June 2008
Iron Man 2," Less sparks reveal the metal...
","Six months after Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) unveiled to the world that he was Iron Man, Stark has created an era of peace between the super powers of the world but he is faced with increasing pressure from the government to allow the military use of the Iron Man suit for military application. This does not come at a good time for Stark as competition from a rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), is continued by the strange appearance of Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke). Vanko poses a threat to Stark as he shares the same knowledge on how to build the arc rector on which the Iron Man suit works.Iron Man 2's story shares a little too much similarity to that of the original. Like the first, Iron Man 2 is not aggressive as it bathes itself in some quick humour and a rather silly middle-arc. This keeps the comic book feel of the source material unlike The Dark Knight, for instance, which attempted to rework Batman into a more real world setting. That said, Iron Man 2 does a great job of seeming real with some potentially viable politics occurring: the US government wanting the Iron Man suit for military application makes sense. In addition to this, Iron Man 2 does a decent job of setting in motion the upcoming Avengers film. Nevertheless, the film's narrative falters in two distinct ways: familiarity and lack of focus. The problem this time around is that the villains, and their motivations, are too familiar to that of the villain in the first film. Both Hammer and Danko appear as two parts of Obadiah Stane from the first film, and like Stane before they want the technology behind the Iron Man suit. Granted, Danko is able to make the arc reactor himself due to an interesting sub-plot, which plays less into the story than expected, but the villains ultimately come down to just wanting what Tony Stark has. Consequently, the arrival of two villains also brings along a few more heroes including Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and the arrival of War Machine. While it is great to see the Avengers plot moving ahead, it results in less glory time for Iron Man himself. By the film's closure, it feels as if Iron Man had not done enough with so many different characters getting perhaps a little more screen-time then they ought to. There was talk of re-shoots having to take place for the film and it shows at times: with so many characters and villains, the films pacing can feel offish on the odd occasion because there is just a little too much for what the story is trying to convey. Perhaps if structured a little more like The Dark Knight, in terms of villains and heroes, Iron Man 2 would have been a bit more coherent, but I suppose it just was not 'part of the plan'. Nevertheless, it is a workable story that keeps things going but it could be a lot tighter.On the acting front there is a lot more to be desired, but there are still some slight issues. Downey Jr. and Paltrow slide back into their respective Iron Man characters with relative ease. It is also great to see how both build upon their characters as the character development allows them to: Downey Jr. is able to emphasise the despair and narcissist feeling he has about his own individual mortality, whereas Paltrow's gives Pepper Potts the more assertive nature she needs to keep Tony Stark in check. While their romantic relationship is not as strong as it could be, it is noticeable from their scenes together. Don Cheadle replaces Terence Howard from the first film and does a respectable enough job. The rest of the cast are adequate to a point with Rockwell overacting his role with decent results, Johansson being a little dull with hers, and Rourke not having nearly enough screen time to be a menacing villain.The computer graphics are nice to look at but are never overly convincing. While they work there are odd occasions where the texturing on the Iron Man suits appears too cartoon-like. That said they look great in action scenes, of which there should have been more, while the special effects only prove to enhance the overall graphics.Much like the first film, there is little in terms of swearing and no nudity beyond revealing outfits. Sex is merely referred to in passing while the violence, with some mild blood in the odd scene, is pretty similar to the first film with explosions, gunfire and hand-to-hand combat taking place.Iron man 2 is a fun film but it is just not as good as its predecessor. While the basic plot resembles that of the original, Iron Man 2 is far too ambitious for its own good. The new heroes do not develop strongly enough and take away vital screen time from Iron Man. Likewise, the new villains feel underused and ultimately never pose any real threat, especially when they are easily outnumbered and outmatched by the heroes. The narrative is not focused enough and the action sequences are never as spectacular as they should be. Nevertheless, the narrative introduces some interesting developments and gets the basic ideas across to the audience, while the actors do a good job. Like Quantum of Solace, Iron Man 2 feels like a weak middle ground for a possible satisfying conclusion: the potential is there.",6,1,5,3 May 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Two pirates lives for me...
","It's not everyday that a movie based upon a Disney theme-park ride, is created, and even rare is that such a movie would gain a sequel. However, the days of humorous pirates has been given new life with the sequel to one of the most enjoyed movies to date; Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has finally arrived in port.Dead Man's Chest continues soon after the ending of its predecessor, yet all is not well. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom) are set to be married, but their past dealings with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), has caused both to be deemed criminals. However Will can right his wrongs, and save Elizabeth from death, if he can meet up with Jack, and return with Jacks compass. Jack on the other hand is tied to death itself, as he has a debt to pay to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy).Dead Man's Chest is a whole other beast to the original. Where as The Curse of the Black Pearl was a lighthearted film filmed with humour, Dead Man's Chest sidelines much humour in favour of some dark and intense scenes. In fact, there's nothing in the first half, which remotely resembles Pirates of the Caribbean's awkward yet fun self. It's moody and dark, and contains nothing in value of laughter. It's only till the film begins reeling the second half, does the charm of the original begin to be realized, and it's far better the original too.Acting is once again top-notch but there's not enough Jack. With trailers seemingly shouting Jack all over this movie, Dead Man's Chest actually centres more on Will. This isn't entirely a problem as the story does entail Will to have more screen time, and the ending suggests that it was worth it. Davy Jones deserves a mention as being a cruel villain, but he's never evil enough for the part he plays. There are also many references to the past movie, which really adds depth, and in part humour, to the characters.Another redeemable quality of Dead Man's Chest, is that the editing problem of the first, has now been corrected, and the film has a better flow to it. This could however be because of some incredible fighting scenes, which really brings the whole concept of pirates and the world they lived in, to breathtaking life. Yet, it's a tad dark for the overall experience.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, plays a fine line of dark moments, with light moments, yet never comes close to achieving this balance. Both are almost two separate parts, where as The Curse of the Black Pearl, still had some light within it's 'dark'. The first half is a letdown, and never achieves what the original created, but the second half is a wonder to watch, and will have you laughing in no time. The films closing scene points to the ending of the trilogy, and with a better focus on balance, the final Pirates of the Caribbean, can be funny and intense at the same time, thus washing away the inconsistency of Dead Man's Chest.",7,4,8,4 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," One pirates life for me...
","A movie based upon a Disney theme-park ride? The day I see that would be well, now; Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, takes the world of swashbuckling pirates, from a theme park ride as I have stated, wraps in some humour, and produces one of the best films to grace the silver screen.Pirates of the Caribbean is about the rescue of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), who was kidnapped by Barbosa, the captain of The Black Pearl. To her rescue is Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) who recruits the help of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Together they set after Barbosa and his crew only to discover that they are undergoing a curse, which keeps them alive forever. From beginning to end, Pirates of the Caribbean is a roller-coaster ride of laughter. There is never a joke misplaced, and it sure makes one's views of the world of pirates, far more entertaining. Fighting sequences never detract from the comedy, as there are a couple instances of humour within battle. This humour is brought to the table, most of the time, by Depp's awesome portrayal of the ingenious, yet bizarre Jack Sparrow. All other actors bring immense life to their characters, and what you get is a film where acting is at its best. However, all is not well: the length of the film is questionable, as it appears to drag on for far too long then it ought to. This is sadly due to some bad editing. There are one or two scenes which weren't required in the final cut, and almost every other scene is exposed for being a few seconds too long. While some perfect editing wouldn't cut the length of the film where one would notice, it would make for some faster pacing. Perhaps the editing division was given a little more freedom then expected, and is something which should be tightened up upon in the future.Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is successful on many levels that other films are not. It's not going to be the best film of our time, but will surely go down as one of the most entertaining. Comedy is carefully placed amongst times of story development and times of battle. Many will easily be reciting their favourite parts over and over again. However, due to some lazy editing, the film seems too long, but it's not a problem to get yourself tied into a knot over.",8,0,3,4 August 2006
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Dampened sand...
","When it discovered that a nearby holy city may be manufacturing weapons for enemy states of Persia, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his brothers decide to attack the city in order to stop the treachery. When King Sharaman of Persia (Ronald Pickup) arrives Dastan offers his father a gift that ends up poisoning him. Dastan is suspected of murder and so he flees along with the captured Tamina (Gemma Arterton). Dastan soon discovers that he is possession of a powerful dagger that gives its bearer the ability to rewind time.The Sands of Time is based upon the 2003 video game of the same name but there are few similarities shared between the two. For starters, the narrative is completely different but that does not stop certain story elements from the game sneaking into the odd scene of the film. Fans will definitely appreciate this aspect but their disappointment in the lack of faithfulness to the original game can be understood to some degree. While adaptations always bring about fun possibilities by never been entirely accurate, Prince of Persia forgoes a tale of the Prince finding redemption in place of a tried-and-tested tale of the protagonist attempting to clear their name of some terrible act not of their doing. This inevitably leads to a variety of locales in place of the single castle which contextualised the game and ultimately feels less unique then the premise of the film allows it to be. That said the story works just fine even though it loses direction on the odd occasion. It falls victim to being predictable at times but a decent mix of humour and some workable action sequences keep the experience from never being dull. On a side note, the film does get some depth from its political allusions to the US invasion of Iraq.The cast can appear unorthodox considering it is a group of Westerners playing Persians and without any changes to speech. Though considering the original game contained a British speaking Caucasian protagonist, the casting come across more like a stylised option rather than a lack of desire to authenticity. The actors do a reasonable job but consistency is somewhat of a problem. At times the actors come across as flat but thankfully there is a charm to Gyllenhaal, intrigue with Arterton, and workable humour from Alfred Molina which prevents the acting from being poor. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arterton only ever finds ground with their constant quips so their romance never feels involved enough by the films end.The film is littered with computer animation and many acrobatic manoeuvres. The animation is an on and off affair but thankfully does more right than wrong. The scale of some of the imagery is wonderful such as the establishing scenes of the holy city and especially the Hourglass of Time itself. Though, the scenes involving the reverse of time appear underdeveloped. The acrobatic sequences are fairly enjoyable affairs but they are more akin to the Prince of Persia spiritual successor Assassin's Creed rather than the original game itself.As a Disney film you can expect that nudity and sexual content play no role in the film. The same goes for language while the violence, frequent and somewhat lengthy at times, is relatively bloodless and involves a variety of weaponry slashes and stabbings.Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an intriguing take on its source material, albeit an obviously commercial one. Perhaps, the creators felt that the original plot was not marketable enough and for all intents and purposes they are most likely correct. The problem for the film is its lack of individuality in a stream of Hollywood blockbuster titles: it is just a pity that with a workable plot and metaphorical imagery that the film never reaches the height of its proposed fantastical nature. Granted, the narrative, acting, and base level sense of wonder gets the job done and makes for a fun time. Though, you would think that if the creators themselves had access to the mythical Dagger of Time, they could have gone back and given the film the needed sharpening it deserves.",6,4,10,22 May 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A slice of fun, a dice of technicalities ...
","Origins: Wolverine gives a glimpse into the history of one the most iconic characters in the comic book industry showing events before the first X-Men film. Brothers James Logan (Hugh Jackman) and Victor Creed (Liev Schreiber) have, with their unique gift to rapidly heal their bodies, served together in countless wars throughout the 20th century until being recruited into a special ops programme by William Stryker (Danny Huston). Logan begins to tire of this group as he opposes the overly violent tendencies of the operations, and eventually he leaves the group. Years later, Logan is approached by Strkyer to help with a task of national security all while Logan's girlfriend Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins) is murdered by Victor, which results in Logan seeking revenge.The origin of Wolverine is a rather intriguing story, especially since Wolverine in modern times suffers from amnesia. Of course the adaptation is not entirely faithful. The introduction begins to quickly settling the arrival of Logan's abilities in a few minutes and then flashing to well conceived opening credits. The story continues this fast pace but once Logan leaves the special ops programme the films pacing begins to slow. This becomes symbolic in the change of lifestyle for Logan but after the first half the film begins to become somewhat fragmented, resulting in a story whereby Logan is forced to fighting another character just to move the story on for a few minutes: the dramatic elements begin to lose their importance as the film develops but thankfully the story's finale synthesizes the action and story in a similar manner to the film's beginning.Many facets to Wolverines life are kept while others, especially in regards to characters are given certain changes. One such change revolves around Deadpool: it is a change which ardent fans may disapprove of but since this is an adaptation, the film works like a retelling of the overall Marvel universe, a concept synonymous with the comic book industry. In fact, Origins: Wolverine becomes indicative of how adaptations should be perceived as a imagining and not always as a as carbon copy of the original text.The actors and their respective characters are, for the most part, well received. Jackman continues his excellent form as Wolverine, but is able to portray him as a character filled with an internal struggle to do what is right while having a capacity for evil. Schreiber, Jackman's counterpart, proves a useful adversary and an excellent binary opposite to Jackman; where Logan is conflicted, Creed is bloodthirsty. Huston performs a good job as a subtly menacing and smug official who wishes to wipe out mutants while Collins is delicate, if not underplayed in the film. The remainder of the cast all perform adequately and their respective characters are suitably added to the films plot. However, this does not stop a couple cameos being more fan service then actually being truly relevant to the overall plot.Another person to be complimented is director Gavin Hood (Rendition) who does a delightful job with his cinematography. Granted, he tends to stay on the conservative side of film making, but this never stops him completing some beautifully shot scenes. Though some of the fight sequences are more muted then they should be and it becomes saddening to think that the film's action, while entertaining, could have been more ferocious. An uncut release could remedy that but hopefully the sequel, if there is one, will allow for the actions scenes to all be equally as enjoyable.However, if Wolverine is to be faulted in area it would be its mixed bag of special effects and CGI. CGI tends to be worse off with the odd action scene looking either too blurry or unrealistic, and even Wolverine's trademark claws appearing far too cartoon-like. The special effects are not too bad with a characters energy beam being very impressive, but another characters defense mechanism being poorly textured. The end result is a mixed bag, and while none of the problems areas truly distract from the overall experience, it is evident that the film required a longer post-production phase.There is no sex or nudity, with language at a low. Violence is abundant throughout the film but it is never bloody, even with one character being decapitated, though this is never graphic by any means.X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a highly pleasurable film: the story is engaging; if lacking in depth; the acting is commendable; the directing is workable and the action scenes are fun to watch. It is a pity that the film is not as violent as it could have been and even more so that the technical aspects, something so well polished in other superhero films, appears incomplete. This plus a few slight niggles to the overall film still allows Wolverine to be among the better half of the superhero genre.",7,2,5,30 April 2009
Hot Fuzz," Murderous police chase...
","The comedic activities of the police force has been portrayed through countless films, mostly with idiotic results. But what happens when you combine Lethal Weapon with Dirty Harry and Shaun of the Dead? You get an ingenious new look on the fuzz.As the best police officer that London has to offer, Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is reassigned to the crime-free village of Sandford, because his amazing skills makes every other London police officer look really bad at their work. Once here, and partnered with the overeager Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the village begins experiencing a number of grisly accidents, and Angel believes that there is more to these accidents then meets the eye.The story surrounding Hot Fuzz is initially simple which helps the viewer gets comfortable with the setting. Yet as events takes place, the film begins to become a little more complicated but it never reaches the point where a viewer would fail to understand what is happening. Instead the story is clever in execution, allowing for a mystery to finally be solved in the usual police fashion. Overall, the story is exceptionally told with its flowing pace that never slumps, and the humorous tendencies imposed within, luckily, do not go to make the story weaker in any way.The film, as the comedy it is, is littered with the typical British comedy, black comedy and a couple of hilarious oddities. While not exactly a parody, as Hot Fuzz does not go out to make fun of particular movies, it is comprised of virtually minute-to-minute laughs and like any good comedy, has its share of serious moments.What makes Hot Fuzz so much better then it already is, is the great standard of acting, not only by Pegg and Frost, but by the rest of the cast as well. Each actor/ actress plays their character with utmost realism, and the characters all fall into place with some awesome chemistry.For a comedy, Hot Fuzz contains some gruesome deaths. While the gore factor is not on par with Shaun of the Dead, it does have its fair share of blood, be it being stabbing or shooting, and even one victim having his head smashed by a giant piece of concrete. Assisting the violent nature of the film ,there is a fair share of language. While sporadic at first, the films characters do begin to utter the F word quite frequently.Hot Fuzz brings the best elements of comedy, with the fine intervention of great storytelling and some down right good acting. If not for the violent nature of the murders and excessive language use, Hot Fuzz could have been more accessible, but nonetheless, the film proves that British comedy has not only the staying power, but the ability to be better then their American counterparts.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",9,2,8,31 March 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Three pirates lives for me...
","It all started with a Disney-them park ride being turned into a film adaption. The translation was nothing short of breathtaking, with an amazing story and well-fleshed characters combined with a vast array of fun humour. It would spawn a great sequel which, while on the same grand level, would ultimately prove disappointing in comparison to it's original, albeit the more lifelike feel of the action was refreshing. It's been merely a year since the last outing, but now Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, is finally back on display.Following not so long after the events of Dead Man's Chest, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), have all traveled to Singapore to steal a of navigational map from the Chinese pirate captain, Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). The map leads to the location of Davy Jone's Locker, where all three hope to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), but with varying agendas.Like the two before, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End tells varying stories driven by individual characters personal motives, and all of these interweave with ease. This is mostly used in regards to the alliance each character has chosen to side with, either the pirates or the Dutch East India Company, but while at first it does make the story more interesting, it becomes rather predictable as the film continues. The various plots are never convoluted , and always fascinating to watch, but they are somewhat undermined by the action scenes which try to be bigger then those from both the previous films. Also, for a lengthy film, nearly three hours, At World's End never feels so, and it's pacing is due to some fine editing.The graphical achievements set by the film are remarkable, with some exquisitely stunning scenery, and really prove to help the action scenes along, as they are never tacky and always realistic and are meshed with the rest of the live-action with unbelievable subtly. However the action scenes themselves are somewhat of a disappointment. The first battle was well filmed, but thereafter all interpersonal fighting becomes bland and uninspiring, favouring extreme stunts over the grueling fights. The ship battles are, on the whole, powerful, but the final fight at sea is ruined by some idiocy and by the constant humour that appears forced in such intense moments within the film. Also the film attempts to create the same epic proportions found in such films as Lord of the Rings, to the point where it seems to lose it's own identity. The choreography is nothing less then stunning, and some of the more powerful scenes, while revolved around action sequences, are never those with actual fighting shown. Of course the final moments leave room for another sequel, but it's probably best that the franchise be put on hiatus for a while before embarking on a new endeavor.A characteristic in Pirates of the Caribbean, is the amusing humour, and while At World's End has its good share, the humour itself is somewhat lacking in power. While it does come in various forms throughout the film, it is rare that it brings in the big laughs, relying heavily on only creating smiles. Considering how funny the first film was, it is disappointing that the third can't sustain this element. There are also moments which require the viewer to be familiar with the events of Dead Man's Chest to help produce laughs.The acting is once again of excellent standard, with Will being courageous as ever, Swann going against the stereotype of a subservient woman, and Jack being, well Jack. However this is one of the few problems plaguing At World's End: character development. Every individual character is still a carbon copy of themselves from the previous film. Besides learning a few tidbits on even fewer characters, the overall cast never grow in any way, and in fact feel stereotyped by their own selves. One interesting development comes in the form of hallucinations Jack has of himself. While somewhat humorous at the times these hallucinations appear throughout the film, they get rather stale quickly and only serve to detract from Jack's personality, and this gives him less of impact in the film then you would expect. This doe however give other characters a chance to dominate the films proceedings instead of having it solely done by Jack.Being devoid of sex, nudity and language, At Worlds End is not without its violence. It is never graphic by any means, but can seem rather violent for most children.What started with smooth sailing, and a bumpy voyage, ultimately ends on a satisfyingly note, but it's not the film many would have hoped for. The magic of the original is mostly not present, the characters lack the depth they had captured from the previous installments, and the humour and action is not of an exceptionally high standard. Still, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is entertaining, with some gorgeous scenery and choreography, likable characters, and a fulfilling fantasy story :never has the world of pirates from long ago felt so real and fresh.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",6,13,30,23 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," About time for a costume change...
","A current Hollywood trend is to scream the likes of trilogy, trilogy, trilogy... if only it were that simple. As these series bank on their final act, one would expect the finale to always be of the best quality. But both past and present attempts have proved that this is not always the case.Spider-man 3 slings off soon after the events of it's prequel: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is ready to propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and New York is buzzing from Spider-man fever. Yet everything turns haywire as various problems begin to arise. J. Jameson (J.K. Simmons) is playing with the idea of giving Peter's position at the Daily Bugle to Eddie Brock (Topher Grace); Mary Jane feels that Peter and herself are on different wave lengths; Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to avenge his father's death; the murderer of Peter's uncle is revealed to be Mark Flinto (Thomas Haden Church); and Peter undergoes a personal struggle of revenge.Spider-man 3, while not convoluted by any means, contains a variety of complexity in regards to its overall storyline, which is the first of many mistakes that inhibit the film: there is too much happening and Sam Raimi can never seem to control it. With this comes the lack of character development and depth of the existing plots. Of all three villains, the new Green Goblin is perhaps the best handled, with the rift between Peter and Harry widening. This story arc had to be completed, and is done so with a definite, if not sad ending. The next of the villain is Sandman, who yields an intriguing story. He was part of the murder of Peter's uncle, and is desperately trying to save his daughter from an illness, but as the film continues, it's the former which takes precedence over the latter factor of his story. This only goes to make Sandman more of a villain and less a sympathetic character as he ought to have been. The last of the villains, while a fan favourite, is poorly integrated into the film. As quickly as Venom appears, does he as quickly disappear. While an extension of Brock, Venom never has time to grow to allow for a convincing villain. Venom's position is similar to a lesser villain, and better used at opening the film, instead of concluding it. While the romance between Peter and Mary Jane is the most positive in terms of story development, this arc is not faultless, especially with the introduction of Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard), who seems to be thrown into the mix at the last minute, as her role is underused and pointless.Also, the overall vibe of the film is lacking. There's no flow between scenes and every action comes across as very coincidental and linear. Also ridden in the film are oddball scenes, which bring nothing to the film or its characters. Such scenes contain Peter dancing at a Jazz club, or a kid muttering 'Wicked cool' during a fight scene. These are amateur at best, and really downplays the credibility of Sam Raimi: these scenes add to the overall length of the film, but while their exclusion would help pacing purposes, it serves to emphasis the lack of depth apparent throughout. If anything, Spider-Man 3 should have been told through the course of two films to help character development.Most of the overall cast do not go about helping matters. Sadly, it's the main characters who provide the least, with Dunst never fully completing her character, and Maguire never being able to show the evil side of Spider-Man without comical results. Grace and Hayden play their parts with mediocre success: they show that they can act but their characters never reach actuality and there are nuances of dialogue problems which come across as rather questionable.The most memorable performances come from Howard and Franco. Howard, while in a limited role exudes an energetic spunk which is omitted from the rest of the film, even the action scenes. Franco, however, continues to show that he does possess ability to act, and he is easily a character who many will be able to feel for. Franco represents the emotional capacity of his character who is dealing with the death of his father, the believed betrayal of his friend, and the obsession for revenge. Even by the end of the film, in a sad moment, Franco keeps up his act, to bring about a villain who is not entirely heartless. On a last note, Simmons, like the first two Spider-Man films, is still superb as the aggressive and hilarious editor of the Daily Bugle.If the problems for Spider-Man 3 could not get worse, they sadly do. For a movie which cost in the vicinity of $300 million to create, it sure does not look like it. The CG, like before attempts in the trilogy, are forgivingly lacking and unrealistic. Sandman is somewhat impressive towards the end of the film, and Venom is far too cartoon looking to hold any real menace. The special effects are not entirely unlike anything seen before, and the musical score is not the most impressive. It's a wonder where all the money was used for even the action scenes, for the most part, are uninspiring. While its never a problem that a director tries to make a film an epic, it is a problem when all efforts are unprofessionally executed.With a mess of a storyline, odd placed scenes and dialogue, underdevelopment of villain characters, and a general lack of energy, Spider-Man 3 becomes the very thing it was toted never to be: an utterly horrid film experience. And any positive elements are so far and few, that they themselves cannot effectively be of any help. Spider-Man 3 attempts to be two films, but only proves to be half the potential of one.--- revised short version ---",5,2,5,5 May 2007
Shutter Island," Undeniably captivating...
","Taking on the case of a mysterious disappearance of a patient in a hospital for those who are criminally insane, US Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) attempt to investigate a rather absurd escape. With the help of the head psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), Teddy and Chuck attempt to unravel how a patient, named Rachael Solando (Emily Mortimer), was able to completely vanish from the confines of her locked room.Shutter Island begins with a brooding image of a ferry making its way through some heavy fog, and it is the very enigmatic nature of the scene which claws its way throughout the narrative till the thought provoking conclusion. This becomes far more evident when many scenes and symbolic gestures in the film are soaked in a hint of polysemy. Of course this would not work without a very engaging storyline and Shutter Island makes for an exciting, and never dull, thriller. This is mostly achieved through the narratives pacing being quite consistent throughout for the film never felt like it was dragging. That said, it can be a little disorientating when the narrative decides its time to bombard information upon Teddy, and the viewer, in an attempt to guide the film to the mystery of Rachael Solando's escape. The film is by no means overly complicated but if you lose track of the information which these certain scenes attempt to convey, the films real twist can appear somewhat disjointed even if it is to an extent predictable.The narrative is only heightened by a group of actors who do a convincing job of representing their respective characters. The character of Teddy is easily the most important and DiCaprio does a great job of conveying the character's need to find the truth while battling the guilt over the horrors of his own past life. Kingsley provides a wonderful performance as the head psychiatrist on the island who wishes to rehabilitate the mentally ill instead of resorting to measures such as lobotomy. He has a restrained and calm manner which exudes his character's intellectual capability. Ruffalo provides good support to DiCaprio, as he assumes the role of the concerned and eager to help partner. The entire supporting cast, involving the likes of Ted Levine and Elias Koteas, to name a few, all perform at their best to assure that Shutter Island feels highly believable, though it is just a pity that some of them only appear for a few minutes. This does result in Teddy being the only character with any real emotional appeal outside the intellectual nature of the film.The filming style by Martin Scorsese is an absolute wonder, especially the final scene, as he utilises varying techniques in order to construct the web of events into something meaningful but abstract. Some techniques could appear unusable in modern films but they nevertheless work to enhance the film. Another good addition to the cinematography is how a few stylised camera sequences are used on single occasions allowing the film to constantly remain fresh. The computer imagery which accompanies the work is of a generally high standard with some beautifully rendered scenes enhanced by the Gothic atmosphere. Still, the computer imagery is not entirely top tier material with some scenes lacking the polish of others.There is no sex in the film though nudity does make an appearance in one scene of a couple of seconds showing some male genitalia. Violence is largely in the form of Teddy's memories which involve soldiers being gunned down and blood appearing in large pools, both for realistic deaths and for artistic reasons. Dead bodies are shown throughout, some with bloody results, and involve adults and children. Language is contained mostly to F-words and blasphemy. Neither overpower the film and are sporadically placed through the plus 2 hour run time, yet the blasphemy can come across as slightly more excessive then required.Shutter Island culminates into a fascinating outlook on how truth can be both liberating and destructive. This is achieved through a combination of a tight and absorbing narrative; superb acting performances; and a film style that enhances the Gothic atmosphere required for the thematic depth to be appreciated. The film does lose some footing with the odd narrative hiccup; some slight graphical issues; and a lack of emotional pull from the general characters for some part of the film. Nevertheless, Shutter Island is an intelligently taut thriller which allows its viewers to ultimately invest in its characters and story while providing ample entertainment.",9,2,6,15 March 2010
Tangled," Old is new...
","Stuck in a secret tower for almost 18 years of her life, Rapunzel has been lead to believe that her special hair is a treasure which should be guarded from the world. She has never left the tower ever since being locked away, but this changes when Flynn, a thief, enters her life.The classic tale of Rapunzel has many variations and Disney has decided to add their take to the tale by imbuing Rapunzel's hair with the ability to grant health and youth. It is through this very change that allows Disney to retread a narrative formula they used so effectively during their golden age of animation: the young princess at odds against an older, yet wicked, woman. This is introduced early in the story and constant interaction between Rapunzel and Mother Gothel ensures the audience never forgets the tyranny that has taken place. Tangled is, without a doubt, a story of self-discovery, and both Rapunzel and Flynn are evident of this growth. Naturally, this is more obvious through Rapunzel, and it comes as a breath of fresh air that Disney has allowed one of their princesses to act her age. Gone are the mature thinking and acting lead women of older stories as Rapunzel is childish, but ultimately charming. The self-discovery story arc does feel undeveloped as the credits roll, but thankfully the narrative is filled with symbolic gestures, such as the visual connection between lanterns and Rapunzel's hair, and life lessons for both children and adults alike. This is all bolstered by some strong humour that is never overused resulting in the narrative being a highlight of the film.The voice actors do not disappoint as each is convincing as their respective character. Moore is delightful in displaying Rapunzel as a teenage girl who learns to be independent; Levi brings charisma to Flynn; while Donna Murphy ensures that Gothel is villainous but one who can manipulate that very label.For the most part, the computer imagery achieves the desired goal of 3D variation of Disney 2D animation. Colour is rich, characters and animals are enjoyable to watch, and the complete sense of wonder is indeed present. If watched in the 3D perspective, the animation does slightly come to life but it never overly used and feels minimally underdeveloped. If there is a slight flaw to be found in the animation it would the occurrence of what appears to be unfinished textures. Many boulders, for instance, look rough at times, but this is thankfully uncommon.This is a Disney animation through and through so the lack of sex, nudity and language is expected. Violence is tame and at times even comical, ensuring the usual Disney animation that kids can enjoy.Tangled is a true gem for Disney and animation in general. While it lacks the overall appeal that has made Pixar animations such a treat, it is nevertheless a step forward for Disney as they retread the type of animation that made them so famous. There a few graphical niggles and the story never quite reaches the promising depth suggested by the material, but these are minor problems in what is largely an entertaining and pleasing animated venture.",9,2,4,28 January 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Exhilaratingly shaken...
","When virtually every trilogy ending film of 2007 has proved to be an assault on the stupidity of its viewers, there doesn't seem to be much hope for the rest of the pack. For surely if the blockbusters of Spider-man, Shrek and Pirates fail us, who won't? Well, the answer to that question has finally arrived, and it comes in the explosive manner of Jason Bourne. The Bourne Ultimatum, a direct sequel to The Bourne Supremacy, continues Jason Bourne's (Matt Damon) search for his original identity before he became the hardened assassin he is. He is forced out of hiding when he believes a journalist, named Simon Ross (Paddy Considine), will be able to help him with his search. Bourne learns new information about himself and the organization which trained him, Treadstone. Yet hot on his trail is Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), a government official bent on eliminating Bourne at all costs. The story within The Bourne Ultimatum, is actually quite accessible by those who did not watch the previous two incarnations. While the film does only make very brief hints to the previous films, it is essentially it's own unique story while continuing where it's prequel left off. It should be noted that the story is not in taking with the novel of which it is adapted. Of course, those who are viewing The Bourne Ultimatum as the first in the trilogy, will be lost to little details, and even a scene which shares similarities with the previous installment. But as both a continuation and a new story, the Bourne Ultimatum is smart with its direction. It is effectively a cat-and-mouse affair with little bits of information cropping up over the course of the film. The story never gets complicated by trying to confuse the viewer, but there is still a strength of complexity not only in regards to the story, but the characters themselves who are major to the events that unfold. A distinct feature of The Bourne Ultimatum is the complete synthesis of story with action. From the get go, there is never a scene which lacks intensity and most of these scenes are therefore naturally action orientated. But while the drama situations don't have as much screen time, it is an exceptional feat by director, Paul Greengrass, to be able to make every scene feel so important to story advancement, character development, and pure excitement. The action is adrenaline pumping, with some well captured cinematography in the field of close quarters fighting, and are easily amongst the best seen in recent times. And thankfully the car sequences follow suite, with some ferocious driving skills.Of course all this action and story is only possible due to a commendable cast, who, for the most part, capture their respective characters with lifelike appeal. Most commendable is Vosen who comes across as ruthlessly cold, and willing to make sure that his position as a government official is not jeopardized. While not having the same presence as Vosen, Joan Allen is nonetheless vital as her portrayal of Pamela Landy, who is still willing to be of help to Bourne. The former contact of Bourne's, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), also features but Stiles, like Considine, have too little screen time to be of any acting importance. The most interesting actor, is none other then Damon himself. The character of Jason Bourne never comes across as a challenging role through the film, but there is a certain melancholic particularity that Damon brings to the character of Bourne, and you can't help but feel the determination he has in his actions.Though it must be said that The Bourne Ultimatum, like it's protagonist, is not free from harm. The amazingly gifted director, Paul Greengrass, utilizes a shaking camera technique. Now for the most part this works, and it greatly emphasizes the fast paced decision making and intensity of the film, but it gets used throughout and can become a bit much after a while. The problems lies in the fact that viewers are never given a time to take in the many scenes, and just relax for a minute or two before the film kicks right back in to some more action. The film contains no sex or nudity, but there is a minor use of language, most notably blasphemy. The film does contain a high number of violent situations, ranging from shooting and hand-to-hand combat to car chases. While the violence contains little blood, it can be seen to be too intense for younger children. The Bourne Ultimatum is a rare breed of action thriller films: it's constantly action packed, always story driven, never without intrigue, and a very fun watch with a coolness factor that surpasses even the likes of Steve McQueen himself. It's sad to have to say that its ultimateness has to be barred by a constant shaking camera, but even with that, the final Bourne film is easily one of the best in cinema today.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",9,1,2,11 August 2007
Over the Hedge," CG animals - where have I heard this one before...
","When it comes to Hollywood, CG animation is a bestseller for profit. However, as much as Hollywood is keen on CG animation from the likes of Pixar, their execution, is a somewhat dodgy subject. Over recent years, viewers have laughed at Shrek, fell in love with Finding Nemo, and enjoyed the high-octane The Incredibles. Yet, at the same time, CG animation can be rather lackluster. Shark Tale is such an example, and even Final Fantasy: The Sprits Within, while dazzling viewers with realistic animation and a film I enjoyed, did not seem to impress the critics nor receive any profit.This brings me to Over the Hedge. From Dreamworks Animation, Over the Hedge tells the story of RJ, a raccoon with a serious problem. Having destroyed the food supply of the hibernating bear, Verne, RJ is forced to regain the supply in a week or else he will become Verne's lunch. While on this quest to recover a trunk load of food, RJ bumps into some other critters that have finished their hibernation. With them by his side, RJ sets out to steal the food from the recently developed suburban area. Over the Hedge is a decent movie to gaze upon. The animation is very good for its cartoon feel, but Square have shown that it can look far better. So, perhaps Dreamworks Animation could attempt a more realistic portrayal, as the market seems to be becoming filled with cartoon-like CG animation, which all looks alike and that is not a good thing. Voice-acting is top-notch with the likes of Bruce Willis (RJ), Steve Carrell (Hammy), and Thomas Haden Church (Dwayne) at the helm. The music department is sadly lacking in any catchy tunes, which is a shame. Though where Over the Hedge shines is in its story department. It all seems so clichéd at first, yet Dreamworks decided to overdo some scenes, which works well in this case. A perfect example is when RJ opens a packet of chips for the animals of the forest, only for the viewer to see the entire earth, and then a nuclear-explosion. It's this over exaggeration which makes the story funny. In fact, without it, Over the Hedge would prove a dull movie indeed.Over the Hedge isn't the best CG animation you'll see. It lacks a little is some departments, but makes up for it, in what is a funny, and family-orientated story. Adults shouldn't be put off though, for Over the Hedge easily appeals to all ages, and that is what CG animation should always aim to achieve.",7,1,1,25 August 2006
Enchanted," Surprisingly spellbinding...
","'Another Disney movie?' Lets be honest, who hasn't yet made this phrase in complete awe as to why Disney still continue to slowly butcher the masterpieces of many years back, with features that are simply substandard in comparison? But on account of Disney's latest venture, it appears as if the animation-dominated company, is finally shifting its gears with the deliverance of the suitably titled: Enchanted.Living in the fairytale world Andalasia, Giselle (Amy Adams) is filled with thoughts of a dashing prince, later found to be Prince Edward (James Marsden) and the chance to share that one true kiss with him. When both unexpectedly meet, a marriage proposal is suggested and after merely a day of knowing one another, both Giselle and Edward are to be wed. However, Edwards's step-mother, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon), has no inclination to allow her throne to be given to another, so she decides to be rid of Giselle by sending her to another world which is devoid of the characteristic happy endings of fairy tales. Giselle ends up in the real world, more specifically, New York City. Here the harshness of social life begins to tug at her, but an unlikely friendship with divorce lawyer, Robert Philip (Patrick Dempsey), helps her to adjust.Enchanted portrays a story where some of its main characters are transported from a realm of fantasy into reality. And it's this fantasy/ reality exposé which guides the film along. For Giselle, the real world lacks the sparkle, optimism and goodness which dominated her beloved world. Instead she is presented with self-centeredness and social dismay. This is what makes Enchanted an interesting watch: the contrasts and similarities of two opposing worlds. A noticeable scene involves Giselle attempting to clean an apartment with the aid of animals; however she is presented with rats, fleas and roaches: a complete change from the doves, deer and chipmunks she expected. The film goes about negating negativity by providing reasons as to why the world should be filled with more optimism and hope, but thankfully never to the point of being numbing on happy pills. And this is the films greatest achievement: keeping everything seemingly realistic and thus tangible for the audience.The film also has its fair share of humour, containing the likes of self-parody, which does a good job of making you chuckle and keeping a smile upon your face.The film does becomes stated in its meaning, in respect for younger children, but luckily there are drops of symbolism, and references to a few other Disney titles, which help deepen the experience for the older generation. An aspect which must be highlighted is how Enchanted breaks the stereotype of the fairytale maidens. We are presented with females who aren't merely subservient but have self-control and are willing to be assertive. Yet this happens only towards the end and comes out of nowhere. This is my main complaint: the film is a few minutes too short. There is not enough time to sufficiently enhance the characters attitudes and emotions, and the opening animated sequence is far too quick in its aim. The everlasting love between Giselle and Edward in the beginning of the film only comes across as emotionless as it lacks the necessary buildup. Also, I felt the ending was far too predictable. There is a good chance that you will guess the specifics of the ending about three quarters through the film. As well, the ending is far too brief and basically throws out the reality notion the film does well to convey.Like all Disney animation, the voice acting in the few animated sequences of Enchanted is handled superbly. Best yet, the actors translate nicely into live-action where the acting ability is noticeably strong. Whether it is the carefree innocence of Giselle, simplemindedness of Edward, seriousness of Robert, or even the evilness of Narissa, every actor brings a realistic approach that works within the framework of the films context. The supporting characters of Pip (Jeff Bennet in animation; Kevin Lima in live-action) and Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) prove just as capable as their leads. The film also expectedly sports a musical aspect, with both Giselle and Edward being the forerunners of this department, and they both deliver great performances, with a piece by Adams as a high point in the film.It is, however, a pity that the love interests of Giselle and Robert, Edward and Nancy(Idina Menzel)respectively, get a bit too little screen time. While their participation within the story is not nearly as important as the characters of Giselle and Robert, by the end of the film they are given a major story arc, but little characterization to support it. Also, while a minor issue, Giselle's character appears as being a hint too childish in her naivety in the live-action segments, while her animated self is aptly suited. It would have also been a nice addition to include a bit more singing but what is provided is, at least, sufficient.As a Disney film, one can expect content that is appropriate for the whole family. There's no sex, nudity albeit a scene with Adams in a towel after a shower and a nude statue. There is also minimal non-offense language use, and violence only rears itself in a small quantity towards the end of the film.Enchanted is easily one of the best family films to grace cinema in the last few years. Regardless of your demographic, there is bound to be very little any movie-goer can find wrong with this experience. Yes, it falls short of being ranked amongst the top-tier, but it just makes for such a compelling case study of our world, and is just so fill of love that it almost breaks my heart not to add another point to the overall score. Enchanted will make you feel exactly so, and thank goodness for that.-- Full version available at http://cruizd.blogspot.com --",8,2,4,16 December 2007
Quantum of Solace," A disappointing second leg after an amazing start...
","Beginning very soon after the events of Casino Royale, James Bond (Daniel Craig) has kidnapped the notorious Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), only to learn that there is a secret organization which has infiltrated various levels of social order around the world. Seeking revenge for the death of Vesper and more information on this organization, Bond goes on a rampage and discovers an interesting connection to philanthropist Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Continuing off the intriguing storyline left from Casino Royale, it was expected that Quantum of Solace would continue to showcase quality story telling. With a run time that is 40 minutes less and with more action sequences, it becomes painfully obvious three quarters through the film, that the scriptwriters had no real intention of telling a cohesive story, and even less desire to create any characterization, the most prominent perhaps coming from Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) but even then its only because we knew so little of him from the previous film. All Quantum of Solace ends up showing is that there is indeed a bigger organization of villains. The events which are undertaken in the story are interesting to a point yet instead serves more as a backstage for the side story of Camille (Olga Kurylenko), which itself is very unimportant to the greater scheme of things, though it's nice to see a Bond woman get a more fleshed out story then in previous incarnations. Even the story arc that relates back to Vesper seems unimportant until the films end: it was a major arc going into the film but is somewhat underplayed. Another slight problem comes from scene advancement being inadequate a times. There are just too many scenes which don't gel logically. But there are a few noteworthy additions to the story. M and Leiter seem more important to the story this time around, M a little too much perhaps. Leiter's character is more ambiguous this time and has a story arc of his own; in fact it should be said that lesser characters are given some story time but neither of them truly affect the plot much. On another positive note there is more humour in the story this time around, especially involving the expected Bond quip after a dispatch. It is just a pity that the film doesn't use up more time to flesh out the story more. However it is very possible that the film is merely a bridge to the third entry. If this is the case, then Quantum of Solace serves it's purpose as the action story that connects the two more story focused entries. However this will only work if the next film brings back the intrigue of Casino Royale and allows for some character development.Thankfully the action sequences are bigger and better then those in Casino Royale. While the chase scene feels awfully ripped from the previous film, there is more variety in what is shown, such as the various vehicle scenes. Though at times the action does seem somewhat muted. It looks good most of the time, but it feels like the director is trying to much to make Bond feel like other modern spy flicks, such as the Bourne trilogy, instead of trying to make Bond feel like Bond. So while the many action sequences are fun to watch, they do not help give the film a distinct feel. There is no major problem to the Bourne-like makeover Bond has gotten, especially for the character at this time in his career, as it allows him to come across as more brutal, but this nonetheless takes away from his charm. Sadly the staple intro sequence of the film is underwhelming, both with its music and animation, which had far too much of Craig holding a gun, but thankfully had the female silhouettes missing from Casino Royale's intro. On the acting front, Quantum of Solace is adequate. Dench is once again amazing as M, and Craig portrays his Bond well. But aside from the minimal character development his character has towards the end of the film, it is still debatable whether he could pull off a traditional Bond instead of a normal action hero as he is currently doing: problematic since the currently written Bond feels nothing like James Bond, and hasn't developed from his prior outing. Giannini and Wright are as good as they were before. Kurylenko is an interesting addition and her character, Camille, gets a lot of time to be developed. Her motivations in the story are somewhat clichéd and forced, and Kurylenko is not the best actress for the role. She does a decent enough effort to make the character passable. Her most intriguing aspect is her somewhat similar situation to Bond. There is a nice scene shared by the two, mimicking a scene between Bond and Vesper a little too much, but it helps develop Bond as still having some form of humanity. Mathieu Amalric as the villain Dominic Greene, is also another decent affair. He is no where near as villainous as Le Chiffre and as such there's little for Amalric to do with the character except play him out as more of a caricature, and in this sense, he succeeds.There is some sexual content, along with some language and violence. The latter involving vehicle crashes, gun fire and melee combat, but none of which is overly violent. Quantum of Solace is a fun film to watch but don't expect to hold the same level for depth as Casino Royale. The film is a disappointment since it had so much to expand upon but ultimately doesn't. The action is great, if unoriginal at times, and the acting is solid. But the film fails in several departments while bettering Casino Royale in others. As a standalone, the film does not quite not work, feeling seemingly out of place, but as a bridging film it does, and hopefully it is.",7,3,4,19 November 2008
District 9," A fascinating delight ...
","After over 20 years of keeping a mysterious alien race, referred to as Prawns, in check in an area known as District 9 in Johannesburg, South Africa, Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is given the job of relocating the aliens away from the city so as to ensure that they pose no threat to the citizens of Johannesburg. But during a raid on one of the alien's shack, Wikus comes into contact with a substance that causes him to become the number one person of interest throughout the world.District 9 is a remake of sorts of a short film from 2005 known as Alive in Joburg, and is filmed in two manners; the traditional film-making process and a documentary approach. The latter is mostly used for the first arc of the films narrative. It combines interviews and news reports, with documentary segments relating to Wikus and the relocation work he will be doing with the aliens. This film perspective is masterfully controlled by Neill Blomkamp and the integration of, and eventual change to, a more formalized camera work seems effortless and natural. This also provides the narrative with some added depth: instead of a linear exposition of Wikus and his reassessment of the whole situation, the audience is provided with history prior to the events taking place, even recalling vital information as to why the aliens are informally referred to as 'Prawns'. However the greatest strength of the narrative is how it parallels Apartheid. While the events in District 9 could relate to events such as the Holocaust, it is quite obvious that Apartheid is the core starting point of interest. This even goes as far as replicating the xenophobia which is strife within South Africa. For instance, replacing the African majority being subjugated against, are the technologically superior aliens. And even though the film is science-fiction, great strides have been taken to make the material as real as possible. These include the poor living conditions; an almost picture perfect representation of shacks through South Africa; and even finer details such as the African SWAT member calling Wikus by the term 'boss'. These are not just randomized stereotypes, but rather real life occurrences of South African living. This combined with the well structured story results in an entertaining and engaging narrative. However there are some points of interest which seem to get very little attention and any audience without an understanding of Apartheid might be feel something is amiss. For instance, the aliens who are clearly superior to humans seem to show little resistance to the poor conditions they are forced to live with. This may appear as a plot-hole, but essentially is only mimics how the White apartheid government were able to exert control over every other racial group, even when they were outnumbered nearly ten-to-one by the African population.Continuing the believability of the South African context is the actors department, most notably Sharlto Copley who uses an incredibly authentic Afrikaans accent. Wikus is clearly a second language English speaker and Sharlto replicates this well, combining his characters need to speak English with instances of resorting to Afrikaans when swearing. Sharlto is only a first time actor in District 9, which is incredible to note considering how believable his acting is. Wikus goes from being a jerk to desperately fearful for his own life because of how the odds change against him. Regardless of how Wikus develops, Sharlto conveys his character with great realism. The remaining cast are all essentially secondary, and while they perform good jobs of keeping the level of acting high, they do at times falter a bit, but thankfully very rarely.There is no nudity and sexual activities are only talked about and on a rare basis. Language is strong and consistent with a variety of expletives being used with the F-word uttered at least around 70 - 90 times. Most of these are spoken by Wikus and in Afrikaans, but considering how the F-word sounds similar in both Afrikaans and English, it is not difficult to know what is being said. The language is contextually fit though there is the odd scene where it does feel a bit too much or unnecessary. The intensity of violence matches that of the language with some fairly graphic scenes. Granted many of the deaths happen at a very quick pace but people are essentially vaporized into bloody matter or hacked apart, and this does not even account for the many instance of gunfights and psychosocial cruelty which takes place. Unlike the language at times, the violence is very fitting for contextual purposes in order to emphasis the brutality that existed during Apartheid and even in current day South Africa. South Africa is a violent country, and Neill Blomkamp does not shy away from this.Both cinematography and the CGI are stunning. Neill Blomkamp is slightly experimental at times, such as filming from just above the barrel of a gun. He never does so frequently, but they surprisingly work. Another factor which is nicely executed are the action sequences which are viewable enough for the action to appreciated, but also slightly frantic to heighten the atmosphere. Accompanying this is some stellar CGI which blends into reality very well: the alien mother ship is the best example as it appears so natural while hovering over Johannesburg.District 9 is being heralded as one of the best science fiction films to ever be showcased and its not difficult to understand why: it has a mature and exciting narrative, even if unclear at times, which brings about enough material to further the created universe in many directions. With a brilliant example of acting by Sharlto Copley, fascinating cinematography from Neill Blomkamp, high quality CGI, and engaging violence, District 9 is one of the most exciting films of recent years with only a few hitches. And as for this year, it easily relegates other recent blockbusters to the levels of mediocrity they deserve.",9,4,9,28 August 2009
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Melancholic beauty
","Hollywood has the idea to glamorize and exaggerate virtually every historical figure without acknowledging that the respective person's true self. This creates a flawed notion of the time period, yet there are times where a biopic is created with truthful richness and this so happens to be one of those times.As the title explains, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is pretty much that and, of course, the events that led up to the act. Jesse (Brad Pitt) decides that he will attempt one last robbery and call his career quits after that. Yet after the feat paranoia crawls into Jesse as he begins to debate whether members of his last outing might in fact take the large bounty that plagues him. Over time he becomes interested in Robert Ford (Casey Affleck), a nineteen year old who has idolized Jesse since his childhood but discovers that the outlaw hero is not what he appears.From the very opening scene the film captures you in its Western setting, and the authenticity of the period of the outlaw Jesse James is virtually realistic, albeit a few historical inaccuracies. Though if you aren't well versed in the history of Jesse James you won't have much to worry about, as these inaccuracies are relatively minor and doesn't impact on the overall feel of the characters, and story. The film is slow and almost action-less. For the most part this suitably helps the films haunting veneer. But beyond the realism and atmosphere, the film has an excellent way of never defining a definite hero or villain. Yes, it is obvious how certain characters are to be finally viewed, but Jesse is not the heroic outlaw he is perceived to be. He is mocking and willingly to kill needlessly. As well, Ford is not just the coward he is made out to be. He's a fragile character who has good intentions but his youthfulness does not allow him to see further then his actions.Once again Brad Pitt proves a wonder to watch, with his portrayal of Jesse James being one of his best. You can feel the cold, calculated nuances of Pitt's acting and the love and compassion his character is capable of. His acting his realistic and he is supported wonderfully by the rest of the cast, especially Casey Affleck, who on par with Pitt. Affleck has never struck me as being that great an actor, but his performance was nothing less than amazing. He exudes a creepy nervousness that is just waiting to burst into something more.There is, as well, an accompanying narrator. Who this person is remains a mystery, but who he is, is never ever the point. The narrator (Hugh Ross) like all narrators, serves as the story's guide, pointing out information of extreme importance, In fact, while the film is long, it could have been longer were it not for the narrator. He brings about certain bits of information throughout the film which adds depth to various characters, without these particulars having to be shown. One such time explains how Frank James (Sam Shepard) felt after the death of his brother Jesse, but we never see the character post-Jesse's death. It appears like a quick scheme to get more story development without showing more, but its execution is practically flawless. The music department is pretty thin: the majority of the film plays without music whatsoever, and when music is used, it's done so as a transition point from one main story arc to the nest. Best yet, it doesn't feel out of place and only goes to enhance the somber atmosphere of the film itself.If there is anything stopping this film from reaching greatness, it would be pacing issues. The film is just a little too long for its own good. While its final length cannot be cut by much, as every scene portrayed is of utmost importance, some scenes do linger on a few seconds too long. Much of the additional runtime comes from the director's attempt at adding abstract, yet serene, images of the environment, and just being too art-like. This is partly in due to the great number of times the director, Andrew Dominik, tries these shots, and also because every time this is performed, the main focus is always in the middle. While this is particularly the function of having an images centerpiece in the middle for emphasis, it just happens far too often and the art-like nature of the film loses its appeal. Still the director does indeed have some real highpoints, especially the beginning of the day of Jesse James death, where we are greeted with a splash of nervousness in regards to Ford. Even towards the end of the film the director experiments and with great results, adding much depth with symbolism. The scenes that are up to this quality show the ability the director has, but its shame he falls into a mediocre pattern.No sex and no nudity although there is a scene involving one man walking on a woman who is using the bathroom. Language use is kept to a minimum and violence, while infrequent, is violent and realistic.The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, sadly, misses its mark by a few inches. The story is engaging, if a little inaccurate and a little too much to digest in regards to the films length; the acting is of a sublime quality; the music is well placed and fits the films overall mood nicely, and the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking in its simplicity, but becomes overused. If you can survive till the films conclusion, and honestly if you cannot then it is a real shame, you will have watched one of the best films to grace 2007. The name of Jesse James still lives on, but now in a far more grand state.-- Full version available at http://cruizd.blogspot.com ",9,1,3,21 December 2007
Twilight," Blood draining...
","Moving to Forks, Washington to live with her father, Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) becomes interested in the Cullen siblings. One sibling does catch her attention, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), but his quick and apparent mood swings begin to annoy her. After much pushing for information, Bella learns that Edward is a vampire.Being an adaptation from a novel which has become quite popular among teenagers, mostly female, one would expect the story's translation to hold true to its source material as best as possible. It's hard to believe that it does at all because the story contained in the film is ultimately bland. There is no depth, no complexity to the plot, no intriguing characterizations: just a simple love story which doesn't hold much in terms of credibility. And this is because character motivations are never fully established. While the love Edward and Bella have for one another is easily based on outwards attraction and grows into something meaningful, the haste at which both characters are able to confide in and accept one another is unreasonable. At one point Bella is attracted to Edward, just to have him act cruel to her, then to find out he's a vampire and still place her complete trust in him that he won't harm her. While their love is touching in a Romeo and Juliet sort of way, that does not stop it passing off as completely illogical and idiotic. Still there is a certain quickness to it all that does make for an interesting watch at times for the concept itself is a fascinating one.The acting doesn't fare any better. Side characters are merely caricatures and the main characters are underdeveloped so it is no wonder that the level of acting is average. Kristen Stewart comes off as far too disinterested in absolutely everything. At first it seems acceptable when she doesn't which to be bothered much by people at school or her father, but when she is somehow madly in love with Edward her monotonic representation remains static. There are times where she attempts to put some life into her character but this is rare. Pattison fares better and seems to get the nervousness of Edward fairly well, and the same applies to when he is intent on saving Bella. But his constant exchanges at love for Bella are not entirely convincing. That is not to say that there is no chemistry between both Stewart and Pattison for there is. It is just not in the form you would expect but more like both are forced to be in love.From a technical standpoint the direction of the film works at times but the music and special effects do not. Director Catherine Hardwicke has a very unique way in her vision of the novel. Her direction yields a simple naturalness to it, losing the classic constructed feel of most films. It does come across as appealing to watch at times but it does become a bit much by the films end. You'll either enjoy the direction to wish for a more natural feel. Regardless of preference neither would have made the film any better. The music is also another love-hate item. The music selection sounds far too forced, as if trying to capture a certain mood for the film's atmosphere which doesn't work. There's a classical element to it, as if yearning to have a connection to Bram Stoker's Dracula and is nice distraction from the angst feel of the film. Lastly there are the special effects which are noticeably unrealistic. There is a blur given to any vampire character that moves fast, but it looks more like blurred fast forwarding and thus rather unnatural looking.No vampire film is really all complete without some sexual connotations and violence: both are included in low form. Language is also kept low and nudity is a no-go area considering the target audience.Twilight is a vampire story which is caught in a midst of smoke. With its average story, average acting, average music but interesting direction, it has neither the cruel seductiveness of Dracula nor the morbid fascination of Interview with the Vampire. With its superficial layering Twilight presumes to be more valuable to modern day teen life then both but, simply put, is not.",5,1,3,19 December 2008
Cars," Almost automobile heaven...
","Many CG animations of today seem to focus on 1 idea: animals. Luckily, that's all about to change with the arrival of Cars, which takes those inanimate objects we all love so much, and blends it into a story where all living life forms are gone.Cars tells the story of a world occupied by none other then automobiles of all sorts. After a heated NASCAR race, cocky race car, Lighting McQueen rushes off to the stadium where the finals will be held. He wants to be their first so as to get time on the circuit before the big race, but unluckily makes an unplanned detour to Radiator Springs. If the situation can't get any worse, McQueen destroys the main road of the town and is forced to repair it alone.The most impressive aspect of Cars is its animation. The CG is cartoon-like but highly slick and brings a sense of believability to the variety of cars on screen. Industry-standards have been pushed in terms of cartoon CG animation, and Cars is definitely up at the top. Complimenting the visual feast is the voice acting, which is indeed good. Owen Wilson brings a lovely cockiness to Lighting McQueen, and the rest of the cast are all aptly suited to their characters.Sadly, while Cars does sport a genuinely good script with a good story, it suffers midway with dome dead areas. These sparse in number scenes add nothing of value to the story: they're neither funny nor attempt to add to the characterization, which I'm guessing was their purpose. This is because all the character development is done quite effectively before these scenes occur, or are too long winded before getting to the necessary development. Sadly, this problem sticks out like a sore thorn and really hurts the overall pacing of the story.Cars is an amazing feat in what it achieves, and will surely be a winner for the entire family, yet it suffers in not being an entirely smooth ride, and sadly can't finish in first place.",7,0,0,6 September 2006
Ghost Rider," Crash and burn...
","Comic books are a universal novelty with an extreme following, and it's no wonder that so many of these comics have been turned into film franchises. But is it not strange that a Marvel hero is in fact associated with angels and demons? Too bad it sounds better then it actually is.Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage), a motorcycle stunt rider, makes a pact with Mephisto (Peter Fonda) to have his dad cured of his cancer, in return that Johnny gives up his soul and becomes the Ghost Rider. As the Ghost Rider, Johnny acts as a bounty hunter who must collect souls for Mephisto. When called upon, Johnny has to kill Blackheart (Wes Bentley) and thus stop him from collecting a scroll of potent power which would allow Blackheart to create a new hell on earth.As a Marvel comic book, one doesn't suspect it to contain the likes of demons. It does however, come across as being similar in style to Marvels other hero, Blade. But where Blade's transition to the world of film was one of a violent nature, a good move considering it's basic premise, Ghost Rider instead moves into more commercial territory. Yet Ghost Rider is no Fantastic Four, and definitely no Spider-man, as it's dark atmosphere would dictate, and so inevitably, Ghost Rider comes across as being rather shallow then it ought to be.The acting is, for the most part, good. There is a distinct evilness in the performances by Fonda and Bentley, and Cage plays his confused character, struggling with the death of his father, loss of his childhood sweetheart and the fact that he becomes a creature during the night, quite well.Yet it is in the execution of the story where Ghost Rider seems to lose its wheels. The beginning of the film contains some disappointing horror-like sequences, which by the end of the film, seem oddly misplaced. Another avenue of disappointment comes in the form of the lousy romance story. While you can feel sorry for Johnny and Roxanne Simpson (Raquel Alessi/ Eva Mendez), it's a pity that their romance ends up being rather clichéd, and ultimately, lacking in passion.The language is relatively dim, and the action sequences, while dark in manner, are tiresome to watch, and do not last long. A pity as the Ghost Rider could have had some great battles considering his character.Ghost Rider comes across as something deserving of more violence, something akin to Blade. The acting is not particularly bad, but an inconsistent beginning arc, pointless romance, and extremely short fight scenes, don't help make a good film out of a cool premise.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",6,2,4,16 April 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," X-treme is not thy name...
","What is believed to be the final X-Men appearance, X-Men: The Last Stand, brings the best of the first two incarnations, adds some politics, loses some characters, and becomes the best in the trilogy. However, it is by no means, an awesome movie.The Last Stand kicks off soon after the events of X-Men 2. The most important thing to know is that Jean Grey is dead. At this stage, a 'cure' for mutants has been discovered. It suppresses the mutant DNA, and effectively allows all mutants to become normal. However, Magneto will have none of that, and he, along with the Brotherhood, will do anything to stop this cure. The X-Men need to stop Magneto, however, the sudden appearance of a new mutant, adds to the boiling point tension.The story is straight forward, and it is played out simply. Following in the footsteps of the recent hit, V for Vendetta, The Last Stand uses politics as a story-median, and while it sounds strange for this to happen, it is perhaps the best story decision. Being a more mutant-acceptable country, the USA president has nothing against mutants, but he still fears the power they possess. It all becomes very interesting, yet the mutants themselves are a let down.Firstly, Wolverine isn't as focused on, like the previous, but he's still the main protagonist. He is an effective character; likewise Storm, Magneto and Xavier, yet the rest are all rather limitless. Angel, Cyclops and Rogue are all used to further the story, but do absolutely nothing of relevance with their powers. The much hyped Juggernaut is a great addition, and his battle with Wolverine is great, but beyond that, he doesn't do anything that you would expect of a villain. This is easily the problem of X-Men: The Last Stand. There are too many mutants, that not enough time is given to individuals, except Wolverine, to allow them to grow, or even seem cool.However, that is just nitpicking on my part, because as a whole, X-Men: The Last Stand, is a very good movie. It's fast, fun, entertaining, though lacking the focus of the first two. It's not at all brilliant, but still entertaining.",6,0,1,27 July 2006
I Am Legend," Little too remember...
","In the year 2006, a miracle breakthrough, the KV virus, is created and toted to be able to cure the likes of cancer. However, in no time whatsoever, this cure mutates into a deadly virus which changes its host into a grotesque creature. Three years after the outbreak, Robert Neville (Will Smith) is the last human left alive due to his immunity to the virus, and he is continuing work on a vaccine to help change those who are no longer human, dark seekers, back to their original selves, while they attempt to hunt him down during the night.With an interesting post-apocalyptic story, I Am Legend comes as one of many adaptations of it's source material, but is arguably the closest in it's rendition. However this is not to say that it doesn't take any liberties it's in story telling so fans of the novel might be disappointed. Even as a moviegoer, it's difficult to understand why certain elements of the novel were changed. While the novels soul remains in most of the film, such aspects as the locale change, Neville's population group and even the concept of the creatures themselves, are altered. These are minor issues, but more important story elements are changed as well. The worst of these being the difference in time line as it seems strange that Neville attempts to contact other survivors by means of a radio system. The film goes onto a vast array of symbolic themes such as heroism to , and importantly, religion, and these help heighten the story's depth. This is well assisted by few moments of reminiscence on Neville's part, where he accounts the last few moments he had with his deceased family. The story also lacks a firm buildup going from a calmness to franticness in the blink of an eye, bringing up a major problem with the film: length.Closing in on the two hour mark, the film goes from a slow restrained manner for three-quarters of its length, only to spiral into a uncontrollable mess. This cinematic experience works best with Smith is absorbed in his isolation and more of these scenes would have really helped heighten the emotional impact. As well, not enough time is dedicated to his experiments on finding the cure and worst yet, the director completely disregards this part of the films essence towards the end, which itself is a real letdown. Firstly the ending is sort of Hollywood-like in it's execution and would have worked far better if it were more ambiguous instead of being stated. The other problem comes from the films skewed concept of the theme of being a legend. Instead of using the heavily metaphorical designation from the novel, the cinema version falls into a heap clichés. This could be partly due to the rushed filming of a new ending merely weeks before release, but this should not be an excuse. If anything, it does give an incentive to pick up the DVD release, just to see how the original ending worked with the rest of the film, how it compared to the novel's ending, and how effective it would have been for a movie.The acting is solely dictated by Will Smith for virtually the entire film, and praise must be given to him for his portrayal of the last remaining human alive. Acting itself is not easy, and it's even harder when you are performing a solo effort. Smith has the ability to shows his character' s aged loneliness with his only companion being his loyal dog, Samantha, and how this affects his everyday ability to function in a society of normality. His performance is also emotional and so when moments of sadness are dripped onto the screen, they are powerful enough for the viewer to care.An important aspect of the film is it's computer generated images, but these range from excellent to dull. The introductory scenes, and those which follow, of an abandoned New York City, are superb in it's realism. It's a real highpoint in the film and really sets up the atmosphere to follow, but it's a real shame that another important aspect to the film' s CGI, the dark seekers, are painted in a bland and non-realistic manner. From their skin textures to their awkward movements, the dark seekers are noticeably misplaced in a film that does so well to contain it's believability.A relatively clean film as only violence makes any appearance. It comes in various forms of shooting, explosions and attacks from the human-turned-creatures. All of these scenes are never bloody , yes blood itself is seen staining the floors in a couple of scenes.I Am Legend has had a strange development period with it's origins back in 1994, and various other attempts to get the film into production.. Thirteen years later and it appears that Warner Brothers has finally got their act together and finished the film albeit its marketing was not exactly up to scratch.. Regardless, I Am Legend is a remarkable title with some classy acting and an intriguing storyline. It's a shame that it has visible shortcomings, such as length and CGI issues, because it is one of those few films that you really want to succeed, to prove that the final product is better then originally believed. Sadly, no matter how you view it, I Am Legend is merely a good film, lacking in reams of potential.",7,0,0,27 December 2007
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Soulless
","As her 18th birthday approaches, Bella (Kristen Stewart) is finding it difficult to live a life where she would eventually become old while Edward (Robert Pattinson) retains his youth. When Bella's small birthday affair at the Cullen household threatens Bella's life, Edward decides that it is best if he leaves her fearing that he is causing her unnecessary danger. This results in Bella falling into a deep depression which her friend, Jacob (Taylor Lautner), hopes to relieve her from.Continuing the novel adaptation of the Twilight saga, New Moon is a misfit of sorts in the series thus far. Regardless of how accurately the novel is followed, the narrative appears to present little new or different from the story presented in Twilight. Bella is still a sad and pathetic person who needs the love of someone else to keep her going. Instead of Edward being her source of love, it is Jacob this time around. And like the first film, Bella's life is under threat from a handful of vampires, and these happen to contain the remainder of the original group from Twilight. In essence, New Moon is just Twilight wrapped up in new skin, arguably paler this time, and it will feel like this for a good chunk of the film until the introduction of the Volturi, the royalty of vampires. This small arc in the film definitely ramps up the narrative into more interesting territory outside the lifeless romance of before, and the characters this romance entailed. Though the story does have one thing going for it and that is humour, and the genuine kind to boot. The film is constantly comedic enough that you may even forget that it was meant to be a tragic romance of sorts akin to Romeo and Juliet, which the narrative blatantly tries to intertextualise with. Inevitably, the story has little substance and feels like a bridge between Twilight and the remaining sequels to come. This is because all the intriguing mythology added to the series in New Moon, such as the Volturi and werewolves, contribute nothing to the film but rather that they could be useful for the sequels.The acting is largely a better affair in the Twilight sequel but this mostly comes in the form of the lesser characters. Of the lot the more noticeable supporting performances come from the charm of Ashley Greene, the acute coldness of Dakota Fanning, and that rather mysterious elegance of Michael Sheen as the Volturi leader Aro. Of the three protagonists, it is only Lautner who makes any commendable effort at acting: he starts off rather low-key but gets himself into a decent position. It is disastrously unfortunate that neither Stewart nor Pattinson become anything more than simply dull. Both their respective characters are meant to be pained at the loss of being separated from one another but they always appear somewhat bored when in scenes together and show little conviction in their emotions. On the other hand, Stewart's scenes with Lautner have more going for them even when Stewart loses her gaze to Lautner's abs.Director Chris Wietz brings a commercial feel to New Moon which was lacking in Twilight, yet New Moon ultimately feels less unique than Catherine Hardwicke's efforts. This does not help the film in any way as it has less going for it than its predecessor did. Music is a love-hate affair: it feels way too forced in helping create a certain mood that at times the music feels oddly misplaced. The special effects are much improved and now look far from awkward. While the CG is never overly convincing, it is integrated well enough as to not be a distraction.For a film based on vampire romance, New Moon is pretty sexless in appeal beyond Lautner being shirtless. There is the odd use of mild language and while violence is more abundant than in Twilight, it is never harrowing enough considering the vampire and werewolf mythology.While somewhat enjoyable, New Moon lacks identity and this is solely based on the fact that it does little to enhance the Twilight formula. Richer mythology is added; the quality of acting has increased in the overall cast; and the special effects have undergone a needed retuning. But like Edward so blandly points about himself, the film lacks a soul. The brewing romance between Bella and Edward is lifeless with a general lack of development throughout all the characters. Likewise, the narrative never really seems to head in any viable direction and it is up to the lesser characters to get the film's blood pumping.",5,7,12,27 November 2009
Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," Delightful tale on love...
","When Surinder's (Shakrukh Khan) mentor dies of a heart attack, Surinder is forced to fulfill his mentor's dying wish: to marry his daughter. Surinder complies with his mentor's wishes however the marital bond between himself and Taani (Anushka Sharma) is merely for the sole purpose of allowing Taani a place to live and not one of love. As an introvert, Surinder finds it difficult to express his deep love but finds a solution when Taani joins a dancing competition: transforming himself into Raj, an extrovert and flamboyant man who catches the attention of Taani.The story gets off to a slow start and steadily gains pace as the film progresses and this greatly mimics how Surinder's life changes from routine to excitement. At heart the film is a simple love story, echoing how Surinder fails to attract the attention of someone he loves and having to become someone he is not in order to do so. There is a nice, simple message to be learnt here and the love story is not entirely clichéd so the film does have a somewhat refreshing take on the ingrained romance tales of Bollywood. This does not however stop the many scenes where Surinder is battling with his love for Taani becoming a little repetitive by the film's end. With a little tighter editing on these parts the film would have also cut a little off its long run time but the film's length is a minor disturbance at best. The film is also fairly humorous, but not quite like Dostana's minute-by-minute comedy. As well the humour does not feel constructed but instead natural giving the context of some scenes a fairly real undertone.There is a slight mishap on the subtitling for English viewers. There is the odd spelling mistake and there are a few moments where the subtitling makes some comments from a single character appear as if one character begins and another ends of the sentence, when it is evident that is not the case. Sadly the credit sequence lacks subtitles altogether and the credits are important in gaining an understanding into the aftermath of the ending with a monologue. While it can be accumulated as to what is being talked about, the monologue itself is fairly humorous and English viewers will e missing out.Surprisingly the acting ensemble is stronger than expected with even the minor characters being more than adequate to the job. Of course Shahrukh Khan is as amazing as ever and anyone who thought he might be losing his shine will discover he is not. In the film Khan has to portray two different personalities for the same character as he attempts to live a double-life. His nuances in the shy and uncertain Surinder are heavily contrasted by his performance as the outgoing and hip Raj, and Khan does so with consistency. The biggest surprise is Anushka Sharma. Her debut performance is delightful, full of vigor and, most importantly, believable whether her character is full of joy or sadness. You would be hard pressed to say she was an amateur. In fact she embodies a top notch Bollywood actress with good acting coupled with a natural prowess for dancing. Sharma makes the music sequences she is in far more enjoyable to watch then they ought to be.That said the music, and accompanying dances, is a slight disappointment. Neither category is bad by any means but they don't reach the optimal level of excitement to truly heighten the love story. But as said Sharma does appear in her element in these sequences and Khan's experience shows through so any sequence with these two dancing together is a worthwhile watch.There are no sexual connotations, violence and very little use of language, making the film a true family treat.Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is an amazing film which tells an equally amazing, albeit simple, story. With stellar acting, especially from newcomer Anushka Sharma who compliments Shahruhk Khan well, and good detail to creating a natural context, it becomes a pity that the film is let down by its musical sequences. They are not bad but not up to par with the rest of the film, and when coupled with other niggles the film is unable to be as moving as it potentially could. Still it's a worthwhile film and not one to be missed.",8,5,11,17 December 2008
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," A subtle performance with a landmark crescendo...
","During World War 2 Bruno (Asa Butterfield) , a German of eight years, leads a somewhat sheltered life in the comforts of wealth in Berlin. When Bruno's father (David Thewlis) is promoted to a high ranking officer of the Nazi regime, Bruno and his family have to relocate to his father's new post, which happens to be nearby to a concentration camp. After many frustrating days of boredom Bruno journeys to the concentration camp, thinking it is a farm, and starts up a friendship with Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a Jewish boy.From the very start the story is displayed in a very linear and uncomplicated fashion. There is no extravagant story telling, no attempts to make the story more then it is. However this is not to say that the film is devoid of depth, because it has plenty and can stir up many symbolic and thematic explanations which help enrich the viewing. But the simple process of the story is more the directors attempt in keeping with the innocence of Bruno to help relate the viewer to him. The reason this is perhaps done is because while the film is relatively faithful to the original novel, many details have been altered. One such is the literary device of a process of discovery from the reader into the true context of the story just as Bruno begins to learn more of the real world. As such the film adaptation will inevitably make it more difficult for the viewer to relate to Bruno because we become the out- group to his innocence. The simple storytelling works though it could have been more complex, including many details that were omitted. But the film's crowning moment comes in it's final 15 or so minutes in what is a harrowing, emotionally poignant affair, and perhaps one the most draining, yet overwhelmingly crafted endings ever to grace cinema. It alone is worth the admission of seeing this film. Authenticity also becomes a slight problem once again in regards to how the concentration camps would have actually worked, but this is never the point as the film bases itself merely on thematic elements.The level of acting is not astounding by any means. but its is generally favourable. Each actor and actress seems to aptly suit their respective character, but Butterfield must be commended for doing a great job of making the innocence of his character appear so real. It must be said that none of the characters speak in a German accent though they are portraying Germans. While this seems like a setback, it really is not much of an issue as it does not make the experience any less riveting as it already is, but for those truly adamant on authenticity they might be a little disappointed.There is no sex, nudity or language. Violence is more figurative then literal as the film's subject matter pertains around a concentration camp. The final scene is haunting though not visually shown. While the the PG-13 rating is apt, it is difficult to think that any child at that age could truly comprehend the film's content.The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is a cinematic wonder which easily deserves a watch from any avid moviegoer. While there are a few niggles, none of which truly affects the overall quality unless you allow it to do so, the film is laden with reasonable acting and story-telling at it's very best with director Mark Herman cementing this with a conclusion so filled with brilliance that's its difficult to think of anything of late that quite matches it. In fact there are few films of late which can even match the cinematic wonder that is The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas.",9,8,16,22 November 2008
Paranormal Activity," Slow chill...
","A young couple on the verge of engagement encounters what appears to be a supernatural entity in their house. Katie (Katie Featherston) makes note of being haunted by a shadowy ghost of some sort for her entire life and this spurs Micah (Micah Sloat) to decide that it would be a good idea to try and get video evidence of this phenomenon.Paranormal Activity covers nearly a month period in which the protagonists attempt to film their experiences while being haunted. It starts off relatively slow and continues so until around the last third of the film. The narrative never covers everyday but only those in which some ghostly activity at night takes place and a few scenes documenting the next morning. As a result, the film ends up being slightly shorter than expected but the run time works well in condensing the overall experience into what it aims to achieve: uneasiness in the audience. Paranormal Activity is not devoted to scaring at every possible turn but rather in creating an overall tense atmosphere for its finale. Advertisements seem to suggest otherwise but anyone expecting the usual horror affair may be left disappointed, and deservedly so as the horror sequences are sporadic and short. However, the events that occur have a realistic nature to them, granted you believe in the supernatural, and this cranks up the uneasiness associated with the horror.Though Paranormal Activity is more than just a documenting of some unexplainable event as it also provides an intriguing perspective into the breakdown of a relationship. Katie is completely horrified at what is taking place yet Micah never really takes it all that seriously until later into the film. This conflict of view begins to erode at their relationship and this becomes integral to the greater understanding of the film. The narrative is not entirely ambiguous as other supernatural texts, but enough will be left unanswered to prompt further discussion on certain actions and scenes in the film.While not performed by complete professionals, the acting is pretty decent and believable enough. The contrast of views between Micah and Katie are easily apparent, and the nuances in each character is performed adequately by the respective actors as Katie is serious and scared while Micah wavers from being jocular to devoted concern. The level of acting does decrease at times but considering the offering at hand it is not overly problematic.The film has a budget of around $15,000 and does obviously show with the hand-held camera perspective used for the film. With this sort of restrictive camera application horror scenes have to be quite calculated. Nevertheless, the style of the film results in longer than expected intervals between horror moments.While language usage contains merely a handful of F-words amongst others and violence limited to one or two non-graphic scenes, there is no nudity or sexual content.Unlike the horror genre in general, Paranormal Activity is never about its different parts but rather the experience as a whole. Combined with a somewhat slow narrative pace, Paranormal Activity becomes a film that is both interesting yet frustrating. This will surely result in a clear divide between those who appreciate it and those who felt that the activity of going to see the film was wasted.",6,0,1,23 December 2009
The Dark Knight," A challenge to its beginnings which falls short on greatness...
","Following the events of Batman Begins, Gotham City is undergoing a crime reformation under the enthusiastic optimism of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the new district attorney who is more easily recognizable as a public figure for good, then Batman (Christian Bale). But as events seem to be going right for Dent, Batman and James Gorden (Gary Oldman), they are caught off guard when an essential and psychopathic killer known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) decides to wreck havoc upon Gotham.Nolan's vision of Batman has been one which moves away from the expected superhero environment, to a context which bases itself in reality as far as possible. With The Dark Knight, Nolan goes one step further and creates a gritty crime thriller with little emphasis on the fantasy associated with comic books. In fact, this becomes one of the few problems with the film, though one which could be easily overlooked. Whereas Batman Begins attempted to keep some supernatural elements within its context, as referenced by the League of Shadows, The Dark Knight does not have any mystical nature to it, but relies on the grittiness of a contrived world. But beyond this, the story is a huge success, creating a well formed synthesis between the superhero and crime thriller genres. There's enough plot, enough characters, and enough twists to keep you guessing, and with an engaging flow, the film doesn't feel its 152 minute runtime. But this runtime is perhaps not long enough: the biggest flaw with Nolan's attempt to tell so much story is that a plot development occurs later on in the film that really never feels complete, and almost tacked on. This plot does add to the thematic approach of the film, which is one of the films greatest achievements. No longer is the viewer asked to embrace the clichéd notion of power and responsibility and instead focuses itself on ethical propositions. Moral dilemma face every character, bar the Joker, and each is forced to make decisions that go against what they believe in. It is this depth to the characters which really makes for a compelling social case study. However, as much as every scene seems to fit so nicely into the film's flow, that isn't to say that the film itself surpasses Batman Begins. Batman Begins proved to be a better balance at telling a story, whereas The Dark Knight did not. In fact, the biggest concern with The Dark Knight, is that the film ultimately feels without enough direction by the time the credits role. There is no main objective to the film, just a series of events which lead to an intriguing, though abrupt end.The level of acting ability is astonishing, equaling Batman Begins. It is very rare to see such a film receive such a great cast and each actor is used to almost full effect. Bale reprises his role as the conflicted Bruce Wayne/ Batman and does so with greater ease then before. However Bale never seems to get Batman's gruff voice entirely correct. Whereas in Begins Bale was a naturalness to the voice, it sounds as if he is forcing it in The Dark Knight. He sounds better in the latter half of the film, but regardless its a minor problem at best. Another minor problem is the complete lack of Dr. Crane/ Scarecrow. Being a interestingly developed character in the original, he is now limited to around 2 minutes in the beginning arc. It's disappointing to see a character with so much potential be marginalized as so. Another character who doesn't have his potential realized is Harvey Dent. He undergoes a great transformation, and his emotional struggle is well executed, but by the films end, this well built character suffers from underexposure or just a lack of runtime. An interesting role comes in th form of Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel. Maggie replaced Katie Holmes, who I believe wasn't all that bad but merely overshadowed by a wonderful cast. Maggie sadly doesn't fare any better: it's clear everyone else is more in their element then she is. And of course there is Ledger as the infamous Joker. Much has been said about his performance and how it is Oscar worthy. I'll say that I agree that his acting is incredible, with some intriguing nuances. Unlike the rest of the cast, Ledger is very much a lively actor expressing himself through body movements. But while I loved his role, Ledger lacks the maturity to really excel himself to the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be blood, for example. Nonetheless, not getting a lead an Oscar nod would be very much a slap in the face to an actor who was clearly beginning to peak.Besides some minor suggestive material, and exceedingly low use of language, the film does indeed sport an array of violence. This incorporates lots of hand-to-hand combat, firearm usage, some upsetting off-screen moments, and one rather violent scene involving a pencil. Its blood free but still nonetheless deliver quite an impact.Regardless of whether you you believe Spiderman, Batman Begins or the recent Iron Man to be the benchmark of superhero movies, there is no denying that The Dark Knight excels in the genre. It is an excellent example of good directing, acting and story advancement, but what makes The Dark Knight a superb superhero movie is not that it is able to recreate its comic book form so aptly, but that it makes a great cinematic piece. Whether you are a fan of superhero films or not, The Dark Knight deserves attention not only for building upon the success of Batman Begins, but for shattering the preconceptions of superheros in cinema. Does The Dark Knight surpass its former incarnation? For better or worse, both are on equal terms.",9,3,8,25 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," New tricks that fail to impress...
","The big three of Summer, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Spider-man 3 and Shrek 3, failed in making effective cinema, but still nonetheless brought in huge profits. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will undoubtedly continue the box office success of the Summer blockbusters, but while it is easily a better film, it still fails to help make a thriving series become good cinema.Continuing where the last film ended this latest Harry Potter begins to show the different opinions to the death of Cedric, and the return of the dark lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The general consensus, as adhered to because of the Ministry of Magic and their minister, Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), is that Lord Voldemort has not returned and that the Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) had something to do with the death of Cedric. All suspicion is placed upon Harry and Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gamdon), as the Ministry believe they are raising an army of rebellion.Considering it is based off a novel, the film does take some liberties but some fans will notice some scenes which should have been included, have been discarded, but nonetheless, The Order of the Phoenix is one of the better novel-to-film translations. Still, the story starts off slowly and never really picks up enough pace to catapult it to its conclusion which, like many scenes, was abrupt. Some scenes seemed rushed, and many camera cuts never seemed to flow logically into the next ,such a scene where Harry is clearly a good distance away from the rest of his party, but then the next cut has him right next to them without any indication that he was going to be walking back to them. Another problem lies within the story itself: it was far to linear for its own good, and contained no surprises for the audience except that the film had none. The film appears to favour characterisation, as the story itself only goes to end off in a similar situation as to where it started, and it just seems all rather pointless in the end.And the characters themselves never help the simple story. While the main cast of Harry, Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) have matured physically, their acting definitely has not. For the most part they are stale in their performances, and even battle to put the right emphasis on certain dialogue. Still, the acting is not completely lost as the older generation of Gamdon, Fiennes and Gary Oldman prove both convincing and the most exciting to watch, although it is a pity that their screen time is somewhat limited. The film also tends to discard certain characters: Cho Chang (Katie Leung) plays an important part in the story, but after her transgression has transpired, and when Harry has learnt of the real reasons for her actions, the film then fails to try and build their relationship, and render her useless for the rest of the film. Ron also is given minute screen time, which is sad since he is easily one of the more lovable characters in the Harry potter universe.Another disappointing factor is the locales which are just plain bland. Gone are the magical environments that littered the previous films. Instead director, David Yates, tries to make a flying sequence along London to be of great eye candy. While the scenes seems realistic, as do the many other scenes throughout the film, it is a bore and just very magical to gaze upon. Still the film succeeds greatly in the special effect department which some truly amazing spell effects, especially towards the end. The ending sequences themselves are noteworthy, because for the first time audiences are given a very war-like approach to magic, which is a completely refreshing notion, as it helps make the film more darker then previous installments. This added darkness makes Harry potter a more believable series, but also effectively makes the film less accessible to younger children.The Order of the Phoenix is both a better and worse film in the series thus far. The world of magic is easily becoming more realistic and not some light-hearted affair at creating a simple fairy tale feel, and the film itself feels more mature. But acting, cinematography and, most importantly, the story, fail to deliver. This latest incarnation of the popular book series, is moving in the right direction and it's obvious that we can expect great things from the films to come, but then again, what is expected is never always delivered, and the order of the Phoenix is a prime example. It's not a particularly bad film, but it falls short of expectations.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",6,0,0,14 July 2007
Taken," Exhilaration with modest substance...
","As an ex-government special ops unit, or 'preventer', Bryan (Liam Neeson)is living his retirement years in hope of being more involved in the life of his 17-year-old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). While overprotective, and somewhat paranoid, of his daughter's well-being due to the severity of his past career, Bryan reluctantly allows Kim to travel with a friend to Paris. However the trip proves disastrous as both Kim and her friend are kidnapped by Albanian sex-traffickers.The story unfolds in a very mechanistic manner and as such also plays out in a linear and expected fashion. This does not make for a lesser story, but it does feel too conservative for the film in its entirety, and the end result is a film which lacks the complexities which the themes explored involve. Still it is entertaining and thankfully never falters, though some events are somewhat out of realism's grasp. By the film's end, Taken has a profound impact due to its subject matter. Nothing is overly explicit and the theme of the sex-trade is not dealt with meticulous realism, but it is captured well enough to make it seem tangible. Half the reason is due to the the directors ability to make the characters appeal on a personal level. Bryan's concern for his daughter is touching, though perhaps a little overbearing first. But when danger comes to Kim, Bryan no longer appears to have any fault: he was right in his judgement. This is not a problem, but in fact a keen reminder of the role a parent plays in their child's life. Neeson plays the role, for the most part, quite convincingly. He shows some genuine concern, and when faced with the task of an action role, Neeson kicks into gear with a riveting performance. However there are moments where he comes across as mundane, and not totally involved with his character. Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen play adequate supporting roles with both showing believable emotion at the dire and horrifying situation the character Kim finds herself in. Though it must said that Maggie has a very strange way of running that can seem rather bothersome; perhaps that is he way of running, as weird as it looks, or maybe she was an ill choice to play a 17-year old.While an integral theme is that revolving around the idea of sex, there is none shown in the film. Nudity is also not shown though some women come close. Language is almost non-existent though blasphemy does appear every once and a while. The film is quite strong on violence, though it is neither gory or bloody. Fights involve mainly hand-to-hand combat with a healthy does of gunfire. It is all quite engaging and exciting to watch, with Byran coming across as a more complete and violent version of Jason Bourne or the rebooted James Bond.As perhaps gathered, the film is not exactly realistic though it is the sort of film which could and deserves to be so if it wishes to rank among the best of cinema. This aside, Taken is a thoroughly enjoyable film with intense action, marred by a few inconsistencies and lack of foresight into the film's overall image.",8,0,1,20 September 2008
Alice in Wonderland," Late for tea...
","While attending a party on a Victorian estate, Alice Kingsley (Mia Wasikowska) becomes interested in an apparent white rabbit she sees. Upon following the rabbit, Alice finds herself caught up in a magical world unlike reality known as Underland. Alice believes she is dreaming, but with the help of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) she learns that she is needed to help stop the Red Queen's (Helena Bonham Carter) reign of terror.Alice in Wonderland can, on first appearance, seem like a remake of the original story on which it is based. But as the story develops it becomes clear that it is a sequel of sorts following the life of Alice now that she is older. The narrative is divided into two parts, namely the Victorian setting which opens and closes the film and that of Underland of which the film is mostly comprised. There is a very interesting point of departure in how both worlds become important for Alice's development as a woman in Victorian London but the relation is just poorly implemented on Tim Burton's part. Though, it must be said that Alice in Wonderland is merely Lewis Carroll's original story just with a Goth coating and with less thematic depth: in fact it is perhaps one of Burton's least original and weakest in terms of narrative fecundity but the feminist undertones are noticeable. It should be noted that character development is perhaps the weakest point of the film with no character really showing off any tangible development whatsoever. It could be argued that Alice does grow as a character and this is what allows her to make the decisions she does in the end, but these actions only portray her original feminist ideas, rather than any self-reflection on her part of the society in which she lives. In a rather bizarre twist, the seriousness of the final act of Underland is finished by a rather unappealing, albeit slightly funny, act which hurts the more film then it helps. Humour becomes a largely hit-and-miss affair with some being plainly unfunny, though the Red Queen allows for some good laughs.That said, the acting is a mixed bag with some actors getting their respective character spot on and others seemingly unable to do so. Alice and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) are sadly examples of the latter which is disappointing since it is with these two that the film carries itself. Wasikowska may be able to look the part but she is far too subdued in her emotion and tone range for the feminist Alice, while Hathaway gets herself wrapped up in poor overacting. On the reverse there are some great performances to be seen with the Red Queen and the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry). Both are wonderful performances and easily help elevate the film's overall quality as Carter shouts out the most hilarious line of the film over and over without any dulling effect as Fry oozes a charisma that is sure to put a smile on your face. Lastly, there is Depp as the Mad Hatter: Depp comes across as playing his usual eccentric character which feels a little tiresome at times these days. On top of this his character's vocal change shows hint of his Jack Sparrow character which breaks the illusion of the film. Nevertheless, Depp does showcase why he is a talented actor but he never really does anything exciting to make the Mad Hatter that much different to previous roles.On the opposite side of the spectrum the physical nature of the film looks and sounds delightful with some good use of computer animation and music. It is never on par with the likes of Avatar in terms of lushness, but there is a distinct cartoon feel which resonates well for the film: just as great as Fry is as the Cheshire Cat, so is the physical manifestation of the character an appealing sight. There are however some shortcomings such as wonky movement animation on the rare character and some major texturing issues resulting in some average looking character models. The added 3D elements in the 3D version of the film lack life and are unimaginatively used for the sole purpose of having the film released at 3D cinemas.The film contains no sex, nudity or language. Violence is in small dose with some sword fighting which results in a creature having its eye taken out and another losing its head but it is far from being termed 'violent'.'Wonderful' would be far too much praise for Burton's adaptation of Lewis Carroll's classic story. Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory before, Alice in Wonderland shows why Burton's version of an existing story is not always a good one. The narrative lacks depth with feminist dealings being the only core concern; character development is unheard of; and the overall acting ensemble do not do the overall cast justice. That said the computer animation serves the film's source material adequately enough; the musical score is worth noting and the film offers a potentially fun experience: it just lacks the wonder it so desperately needs.",6,3,11,5 March 2010
Avatar," A spectacle without spark...
","In the distance future, the human race have discovered a unique planet, Pandora, in which a humanoid alien species, the Na'vi, exists. A highly valuable natural resource can be harvested from Pandora, and great lengths are taken to gain some control of the planet. Jake Sully, a paraplegic war veteran, is offered the chance to take part in a mission to help communication links between humans and the Na'vi by using an 'Avatar' which resemble the Na'vi in appearance. This involves him accidentally getting into the position of getting to know the Na'vi as well as possible in order to eventually persuade them to allow the humans to extract Pandora's valuable natural resourceThere is an obvious colonialist subtext which clings to the narrative of Avatar from the film's opening minutes and this is quite possibly the most rich the narrative ever becomes with little else to provide much depth to the films essence. The story for Avatar is interesting but it is far too cluttered with linear directions on how the film should flow from one scene to the next that by the credits it feels like Avatar has accomplished very little. This is mainly due to the lack of insight provided into the world of Pandora and even the nuances of the Na'vi themselves. Both are explored purely on a foreign viewpoint and it can be argued that this works in conjunction with the world being presented by the human character of Jake, but even when he begins to fuse his being with that of the Na'vi, not much more is presented to the viewer. There is a lot going for the film but it is disappointing that more is not made of it. Another problem lies with the Na'vi themselves. Their language, voices, dress code and cultural mannerism lack any distinct criteria beyond metaphorical elaboration. The Na'vi are, simply put, a mere fantasy retelling of the indigenous tribes of Africa or even American Indians. While this does help the colonialist theme of the film and in making the narrative appear more real, it nevertheless makes the story less unique and only disregards any originality the Na'vi could have as a species. It does not come as a surprise then that the human protagonists are mainly Caucasian and the Na'vi counterparts are African or Native American.Acting is a slightly better department but the actors don't have much to work with as characters fall into defined stereotypes and the odd lines of dialogue lack consistency. Giovanni Ribisi is one of the more spirited actors but he plays a conventional power hungry executive: he becomes representative of the two-dimensional nature of the villains. Caricatures do not stop there but they are less identifiable in the heroes of the story. Worthington provides a more delicate approach to his character showing a clear distinctness in tone between his human and Na'vi selves. This does become questionable at times when even at times of unease his human self appears somewhat lackluster. Zoe Saldana is a pleasure to watch, even though she is a Na'vi, and this is purely because she is more in tune with her character than any other actor. At the end of the day, character development is on the weak side, with one character seemingly deciding to make certain decisions even when little evidence was provided for the character to do so. This also goes as far as character relationships being glazed over, even by the last third of the film where characters seem closer than originally expected.From a technical standpoint the musical score and computer generated imagery work wonders. The music definitely adds to the emotion and feel of the film heightening the more sad and courageous moments while also aiding in scene transition. The computer imagery is staggering in scope encompassing an entire environment. There is the odd scene where textures lose their realistic look but it is in the quality of the animation of characters, creatures and flora where Avatar shines.While sex is implied, there is no nudity beyond the Na'vi wearing little in terms of clothing. Language consists of mild profanities and the odd blasphemous term, while violence ranges from a variety of gunfire and stabbings among others; violence is never gory with minimal blood visible, though some acts can be a little extreme.Avatar is an ambitious film and it deserves to be so with the majestic landscape of Pandora, and her inhabitants, nearly being adequate substitutes for reality. With the well conceived musical score, Avatar has the technical factors nailed but it all falls apart when the film's core narrative is added to the mix. For all the possibilities available, the film forgoes depth for simplicity and convention. If anything, Avatar is an enjoyable film but an enjoyable film with substance that does not equate to its hype.",6,5,11,23 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," Horror returns in fine form ...
","With a promotion on the line for the role of Assistant Manager, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is hoping to fill the position; however she has some competition for the role and decides to prove to her boss that she is capable of handling any situation with falls her way. One such situation arrives when Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an elderly woman, arrives to appeal for a third extension for a mortgage on her house. Christine ultimately decides to decline the woman's request resulting in the old woman cursing Christine to damnation.It is a strange storyline it must be said, but it works regardless of how ridiculous it may become. For many years American horror has gone the route of a serial killer or psychopath tormenting victims, but few rely on the plot device of the supernatural. The film starts on a note of suspense and continues to its end in this manner, and the fact that Christine is cursed to go to hell in a few days ensures that horror does not remain sporadic, but the norm. Plot development flows allowing for Christine to shuffle her curse with her personal life: she is virtually in every scene so the audience becomes caught up in her life. That said there are no subplots to distract from the main story arc: Christine is going to hell and she needs to stop that happening. This is slightly disappointing in regards to narrative depth but the film has clear indications into commentating about society at large. Christine has to struggle with her choice and whether self-gain is more important than the well being of others. Additionally a discussion is created about whether putting on a certain image to impress certain people, changes who you fundamentally are, or exposes your true self. There are fascinating levels of depth to the linear storyline if viewers so wish to engage with the text, but if not the audience will still be greeted with a favourably pleasant experience.The acting front is workable in the film's structure: it is never of a high level but it is commendable in giving the respective characters some life. No one actor cements their presence but it is Lohman's character that rightly gains the most depth. At first it is difficult not to dismiss Christine's predicament, but the story and Lohmans' acting ability allows a new angle to be considered. Relating to Christine is never easy: while she is not an entirely virtuous person, she comes across often as too stuck up for her own good. This runs well with the film's thematic factor which Raimi is able to explore, though it does lessen Christine's characterization somewhat.Cinematography is a fairly interesting facet for the film with many scenes being presented in a 1980's horror manner. This could be easily frowned upon but Sam Raimi, who is clearly appealing to fans of his Evil Dead series, has a keen sense for direction making for sharp scene interaction and crazy imagery. This creates some great moments of horror and complementary sly humour: it is a unique blend but Raimi gets it spot on and the comedy does not go to dim the horror's effectiveness. If there is a problem it is that some techniques are a little overdone, but ironically the horror scenes only keep getting better.Horror films usually have certain expectations on regards to content, but Drag Me to Hell seems to disobey such notions. There is no sex or nudity, and language is almost non-existent. Violence is triggered through some suspenseful showcases and while they do have a factor of being grotesque, they are hardly close in realization to the all out gore and sadism of modern titles.Simply put, Drag Me to Hell is one of the most enjoyable horror films of recent times. It has an interesting, supernatural storyline with interesting characters; reasonably good acting, though it could have been stronger; and intriguing cinematographic design, even if a little overused. There is even well formulated social commentary which really adds wonders in allowing the film to appeal on an intellectual level. Raimi's grip on horror makes for a great deal of suspense and the added humour only makes the film all the more devious. All this is achieved with a minimal level of objectionable content, making the film less conformist to the horror genre as it stands and showcases Raimi at what he does best. Though the shining achievement of Drag Me to Hell is that it does what a horror should: not just simply gross out the audience but rather aim to scare and entertain them.",8,1,4,12 June 2009
There Will Be Blood," Blood like oil...
","Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), a silver prospector, unintentionally discovers that one of his silver claims is a host to unearthed oil. With this, he starts up a small drilling company and in a few years, becomes an efficient and successful oil extractor. He is approached by a young man, who offers to give Daniel information about a vast supply of oil on his family's property in Little Boston, California. Daniel, with his son H.W (Dillon Freasier) decides to survey the land and discovers not only a rich oil supply, but also a community obsessed with the preachings of faith healer, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano). There Will Be Blood is a very relaxed adaptation of the novel Oil! by Upton Sinclair, and becomes more inspired by its source material than anything else. Yet the story is unique in its own way and works for the cinematographic medium. The immediate quarter hour which begins the story, while not exactly artistic in any manner, serves to set the tone for the remainder of the film perfectly. The film is ominous and tense throughout, spilling over from aptly suited scenes, to those that don't fall into the social convention of gloom, and this becomes one of the film's major strengths. The film has an unhurried pace, which is partly due to the story's ability to seemingly feel like it is going nowhere. Yet this creates a sense that the advancement of the story unfolds naturally, and it not constructed in a linear fashion, and continues even into the ending which is rather intangible, unexpected, and simply brilliant. In fact, by the time the credits begin there is a chance that you might need to recollect everything that has occurred, not because it's a confusing film, but because everything is not as it appears in what is arguably a straightforward story.However the sheer emotional impact of the story cannot be felt in full force without the actors: Daniel Day Lewis is once again phenomenal as he leads a rather strong, albeit small cast. Lewis is menacing as the greedy Plainview, being able to express cruel anger, loving affection and best yet, the rare sarcastic remarks his character does provide, is done with lifelike aptitude. His counterpart, Dano, is spot-on with his performance as the creepy Eli, whose innocent demeanor is always questionable. The young Freasier should be noted as well; his presence is important and while his acting is not of a great standard, he is never terrible enough to judge accordingly. Another aspect that makes the acting one level better is the nonverbal cues each character exudes. All three cast members become more believable and the emotional aspect of the film really does prove overwhelming, especially in the later scenes. Considering the heavy emphasis on Daniel Plainview, and how well the main actors perform, the minor characters come and go without much notice and are not able to be of much impact. On a cinematographic scale, the director, Paul Thomas Anderson, outdoes himself. Every scene is calculated, and in doing so, every scene feels just as important as the rest, and this really allows the film to grow. Anderson uses a variety of techniques to keep viewing fresh, with one favorite being a one-shot pan focus on Daniel as he runs towards a flame induced oil deposit, helping the rest of his crew to cut the ropes that keep the structure secure. The many scenes help emphasize the themes with an array of symbols that helps keep the film intriguing and never superficial. This carries over to the script as well which is realistic, flowing and, at times, quite clever.The musical score's composition was headed by Radiohead lead guitarist Johnny Greenwood, and comes across as an oddity within the film. The general feel of the music doesn't seem to fit in with the film, sounding a little lighthearted at times when it maybe shouldn't. But in regards to the film general atmosphere, the music really does come alive, propelling the exact ambiguity shared by the characters and story. Considering the title, there is very little blood in the film, with the violence limited to a couple of mining accidents and an unexpected beating. Language is as well minimal, until an onslaught of verbal abuse in one scene; sex and nudity are nowhere to be found. There Will Be Blood is, in short, masterly conceived. Be it the story, acting, music, cinematography, or multi-layered depth of the film in general, every department excels to the point where the film is virtually flawless. It does, however, suffer a little from the lesser casts presence, and the selection of music feels, on the rare occasion, inappropriate. Nonetheless these two elements do not spoil what is easily not only one of the best films ever created, but one of the rare few that will never be forgotten.",10,3,7,9 March 2008
Ice Age: Continental Drift," Sailing on ice...
","A lot has happened since the release of the original Ice Age when Manny, Diego and Sid first met. This time around, their existence is threatened when their continent begins to break apart, forcing everyone to have to flee from their established homes. However, things go a little wrong resulting in Manny, Diego and Sid being caught up in a battle against a pirate ape, Captain Gutt.For those who have not been keeping up with all the release of the Ice Age series, going to view the latest installment should not prove to be any hindrance into the overall world that has been created. Sure, the relationship between the protagonists may not be fully understandable but each's unique personality is unveiled very early. This ensures that you do not have to think too much and you can let yourself go for the adventures which ensues. This is not to say that Continental Drift is devoid of any tangible story, it is just not a unique or promising one. In short, the main characters are trying to get back to their families (well Manny at least) and this brings up the tried and tested theme of family bonding. There is a good lesson here to be taught to kids, though parents are most likely going to ignore the fluff. Thankfully, the film does have its fair share of good laughs. Most is aimed at kids which can provide the odd smile but then at times the writers do their best and it shows. Continental Drift is not a minute-by-minute comedy affair, but every aspect of the story and writing do adequately fall into place.The voice acting is a lot of fun, mainly due to the performances by Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo. The rest of the actors are by no means bad, for they all feel and sound comfortable in the roles assigned to them. This brings about a voice talent that fits well within the mould of the story itself allowing dialogue and comedy to be presented in a clear manner without ever sounding incompetent.Technically, the film is pretty good. The animation is crisp and clear though lacking any noticeable advances in the medium. The 3D is not too bad itself: it is never distracting nor does it particularly standout or enhance the experience. But what was pretty fun was the full 4D effect. Moving chairs, water vapour being sprayed on you and air passing by your skin. While 4D is not something new to anyone who has experienced it, it did feel like it enhanced the film-watching experience. I cannot imagine it being suitable to all types of films, but in the case of a 3D animation like Ice Age, the film begins to feel more fun for it.As an animation aimed at children, the worse the film receives is some name calling and some relatively non-violent action scenarios.Ice Age: Continental Drift can be seen as a somewhat tired film. It's story is not particularly strong nor is the comedy always engaging. But it wades through these rough seas to make an impact that is adequate enough to keep your interest through to the film's conclusion. Add in some nice looking animation and the bonus 4D (if you are lucky) and the end result is something that can be enjoyable if you allow it to be.",6,0,1,23 September 2012
Sherlock Holmes," Fun yet misguided...
","Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr.) and Dr. Watson (Jude Law) successfully complete another case when they are able to capture Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong) who is responsible for a series of ritualistic killings. Blackwood is sentenced to death and buried but when it is discovered that Backwood has been resurrected from the dead, Holmes and Watson are compelled to reopen the case.The story contained in Sherlock Holmes is interesting albeit untamed. Plot development occurs at an almost rapid pace thus making the narrative seem more complicated than it perhaps is. It does not help matters that by the end of the film, almost every single scene seems to play some part in Holme's investigation: it feels forced at times and interactions feel scripted rather than natural. And for a film based on a highly intellectual detective, the logic of some scenes walks on thin ice. Nevertheless, Sherlock Holmes does contain some characteristics that were prevalent to the character in the original novels, such as the ability to fight. What is presented is a Sherlock Holmes who is just as capable physically as he is mentally. At first this may appear to overshadow Dr. Watson considerably, but thankfully Watson is shown to be Holme's equal allowing for a fair exchange in solving their case.One of the interesting dynamics of the narrative comes from a couple of short segments where the audience is introduced, though loosely, to how Holmes contemplates overcoming an obstacle. This comes about a couple of times but only before he proceeds to completely defeat an opponent in hand-to-hand combat. However, this sort of scene never occurs when you would most want it to: when Holmes is using his intellectual prowess to discover clues for his investigation. Instead, Holmes is left keeping his intelligence a secret, which seems rather absurd at times considering how rapidly he is able to deduce information. It only becomes slightly more annoying when it is taken into consideration that there is very little in aid for the audience in terms of trying to piece together the criminals plan. Sherlock Holmes is less a crime mystery and more an action adventure but regardless of one's preference the film is a fun watch for the most part.Acting is a far steadier factor for the film with Downey and Law putting a lot of energy into their roles. This pays off with both having evident charisma about them and their screen time together is easily among the best in the film. McAdams is not quite as consistent with the rare poorly delivered line yet any fault she may have is never detrimental. Strong provides a formidable villain in theory, but for all his character's intellect he is far too weak a character to ever feel like possibly ousting Holmes. This mainly comes down to a script which does not allow more scope for the character of Lord Blackwood.19th Century London is portrayed rather extravagantly with some great shots of the architecture and the attached gloomy atmosphere of a society still caught up in the industrial revolution period. Action sequences do not share the same flair and while they are workable they could have been better. Additional, music adds to the Sherlock Holmes experience but it never really enhances it and so feels more of an afterthought in the entire filming process.The film contains no sex or direct nudity and language is just as mild serving only a couple of profanities. On the other hand, violence does make up a part of the film though it is never gory and hardly bloody as punches are thrown along with gunfire, hangings and explosions.There is no denying that this new Sherlock Holmes adaptation is all about making the titular character appear more modern and exciting to the audience. The film is enjoyable with solid acting and a commendable story, yet the script has not appeared to have been scrutinized enough with its rapid nature and odd illogical mishap. You'd almost wish that Holme's himself had been asked to look over the script for the one second it would require of him: the film's story would be tighter and better for it.",7,1,2,30 December 2009
The Dark Knight Rises," Standing tall in the shadows...
","It has been 7 years since the Joker caused havoc upon Gotham and Batman made the decision to become a fugitive for the greater good of the city. Since then, Gotham has undergone a massive overhaul in terms of battling crime, with the city experiencing a peace it had never before, and without the need for Batman, who has disappeared. Yet, all of this comes under threat when a man by the name Bane attempts to restructure Gotham into his own making.Christopher Nolan has crafted something unique with his Batman trilogy. Instead of following in the footsteps of all those before him, Nolan attempted to take Batman out of the comics and into the real world, so to speak, in a way that made some sort of logical sense. It is a different kind of superhero movie and The Dark Knight Rises continues this trend. The time jump between the previous film and this one can be a little jarring at first. There is no real sign that things have changed in Gotham with the only information provided by various subtle conversations about the situation as it is. In some ways this can be problematic as it is difficult to truly gauge the context Nolan is attempting to create. But, it is this sort of understatement that encompasses the entire film. Things are not as they appear, and Nolan is not attempting to deceive the viewer of this: the fact that characters talk about Gotham but hint at problems ultimately serves as the perfect backdrop in which to force Bruce to take up the mantle of Batman once again. The rest of the story continues at a controlled pace but at times it can feel rushed. The motivations for some characters have to be understood and accepted almost on the spot and it can feel like such reasoning's are never given time to truly develop. Nevertheless, the story brings about what makes superhero movies so important: overcoming obstacles, and for Batman's 3rd attempt at character growth, it is a wonder to see the character become more then even he himself expected. As usual, some other characters are given some spotlight (and perhaps more so then the previous entries) such as the young cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway). The story can feel rushed towards the end. The final 30 to 45 minutes cover a really long time period within the story and the sequence of scenes Lastly, even though the film is a direct sequel to The Dark Knight it is important to note that thematic elements from the first still exist in order to build character development.Supporting the well crafted, albeit slightly rushed, narrative is a top line of acting performances. The usual suspects (Caine, Freeman, Oldman) get the nods they so deserve for their respective characters but the new cast are thankfully just as good. Anne Hathaway as the mysterious Selina Kyle portrays the character with zealous and appears to have a good grasp on facial cues to truly sink in the reality of her character and the world around her. Next is Joseph Gordon-Levitt who, in comparison, brings a more reserved performance to the inquisitive cop Blake. But a nod must be given to Tom Hardy as the formidable Bane. Bane feels powerful whenever on the screen and his voice is enough parts dominant and sophisticated to emphasis Bane as more then just some brute (as evident in pre-Nolan Batman). There is a good cast here, and they make their characters work. Finally, credit must be given to Bale who embraces the role of Bruce and Wayne and Batman head on. There is a subtle vigour to his performance which really strikes home his characters' anguishes and attempts to overcome the obstacles in their lives.The most evident of the camera work this time around is that Gotham is not as much of a centre piece as it was before. In previous films, it was possible to see Gotham as a character in its own, especially since villains emphasised a need to test the limits which the city itself possessed. In The Dark Knight Rises, the test that occurs is not as apparent at first but the theme of a united Gotham continues. The film is also very much about the human characters and the camera supports this. That said, there are some great scenes throughout the film but the truly unforgettable scenes are more sparse than previous scenes in the trilogy. On a stronger note, the musical score is expectantly mesmerising.As expected of the series, the film has a slightly darker feel than other superhero films but never to the point of pushing the envelope in terms of appropriate content. Violence is a standard affair though the kill count is higher then before. Language is almost non-existent and the same can be said about sexual elements.Nolan's trilogy has finally come to its end after 7 long years, and there is no doubt that the wait for the finale was worth it. Like Batman Begins and The Dark Knight before, The Dark Knight Rises is virtually a top tier contender in every way. There is little to fault in a film that combines the fun of a superhero flick with the thoughtfulness of a human drama. If you believed in Christopher Nolan before, prepare to have your faith rewarded.",9,9,19,17 August 2012
Iron Man," Gold, but red...
","As a weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark is also one of the most well recognized men in the world due to his billionaire status forged by his genius. After showcasing a new missile, known as the Jericho, in Afghanistan, his convoy is ambushed, and Tony is taken prisoner. Spending three months captive in the mountain range, Tony is forced to rebuild the Jericho missile for his captives. Tony instead designs a device that keeps his body from dying, due to the shrapnel he received from the ambush, and as well a robotic suit to help him escape. With these new inventions, and experiences in captivity, Tony Stark's view on his life, takes a drastic change.One thing Iron Man's story is not, is hard-hitting, which is disappointing considering the films opening half. It is relatively simple to follow, and a tad frivolous, but the film is quite enjoyable nonetheless. The script is well-formed, following a logical structure with some genuinely good humour to boot, and it's only imperfection comes in the form of a very clichéd villain. This element also forms some predictability in the film's plot, but it is a minor issue at best. An element which did irritate me was the level of convenience within the story. Yes, most films have moments of convenience, but Iron Man makes them quite noticeable. Such an example being how Stark's laboratory of sorts, somehow is able to be used as a launching pad for getting the Iron Man armour attached to Stark, without there ever being any mention that Stark modifying the place for such an action. It is as of the laboratory was built for that purpose the entire time and it just feels a little off-putting. This makes the concept of believability strained somewhat, even within the context of the film's universe, and it is not just limited to this single occurrence, but a few others, such as how the Iraqi guards had no idea or any suspicion on what Tony Stark was building, even when they had security cameras all over Stark's cell.Thankfully the acting is of a good level, with Robert Downey Jr. stealing the show, with his performance as Tony Stark being absolutely perfect. Be it when Tony is acting in a casual free-spirit manner, or when he is serious, and devoted to cause for a better world. Performances by Jeff Howard, Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow make for commendable efforts, but sadly the latter two have a few awkward moments where they seem honestly bored with the material or incapable to convey the right emotions, such as Paltrow in highly tense scenes. But perhaps the worst example of acting comes in a very unlikely form: Stan Lee's cameo. Simply put, it was horrible and clearly not well thought out.The computer graphics are at times are amazing, but at others times, a bit of a letdown. The good times sport some impressive visuals, especially the sequence with Iron Man flying while attempting to survive an attack from two fighter pilots. Yet this doesn't stop the film having sequences where the Iron Man suit looks like a cartoon rendition, seemingly negating the realistic concept of the film in general. Action sequences are quite fun to watch with some excellent visual effects, but it is a pity that the final fight is far too short and somewhat of an anticlimax, and thus never fully satisfies the concept of the fight in its entirety.I also felt the directing to be disappointing. Jon Favreau has some good moments, and I go back to the Iron Man and aircraft sequence, which really is outstanding, but Favreau has this annoying habit of having a left to right sweeping scene transition. It is as if he was trying to create this comic book effect with the transition and this ultimately comes to my main complaint of Iron Man: it is unsure whether it should attempt being a realistic portrayal or remain like its comic book form. It is a hybrid, but one that doesn't work all that effectively. It can be annoying to see a scene that resembles a good quality film, just to be followed by one that seems straight out of a comic book. How the sequences are structured in both mediums work differently, and are, in this case, not aptly suited to be used side-by-side. I feel that if they wanted a realistic approach, to go full out with that and not diverge into comic book proportions, and vice versa.The film is virtually without any swearing or nudity, but there are some implied sexual imagery, such as the very brief encounter with Tony and a female journalist in his house. The extreme violence is left for off-screen purposes, and involves a lot of killing with armed weapons, and the cries of the victims are quite noticeable. The on-screen action is pretty much the standard comic book hero affair with lots of melee combat, and explosions.Iron man is a wonderful example of a good comic book-to-film creation. While lacking the same maturity of Batman Begins, Iron Man proves to be the best Marvel film available, ousting out the likes of the original Spider-man and X-men 2. And this is because the film doesn't attempt to dumb itself down to appeal to a greater audience, or focus itself on too many elements: it keeps things relatively simple. Instead Iron Man tells the story of Tony stark, a man callous about the world in general, transforming into a man who respects not only himself, but those around him. With very good acting, a well structured story, Iron Man's only problems are a few inconsistencies and its inability to support a dual personality approach. It's no Batman Begins, but then again, it doesn't need to be.",8,1,3,2 May 2008
Casino Royale," Bond against the world...
","With 20 titles before, Casino Royale, the first James Bond novel has quite a legacy to live up to  though it originally sets the tone - and Daniel Craig, deemed unworthy by most including myself, has quite a challenge to dethrone the likes of Connery and Brosnan. To put it bluntly, Casino Royale will easily surpass everyone's expectations  even Daniel Craig is worthy of the Bond name.Casino Royale tells the story of a newly appointed double-O agent, James Bond. While his first official mission as 007, Bond travels to Madagascar to spy on an infamous terrorist by the name of Mollaka. While here, he discovers the involvement of Le Chiffre, who is a terrorist financier. Le Chiffre has lost all his employers money, and has to get it back: a high-stakes poker game at Montenegro's Casino Royale, which he arranges, becomes his very means to win all the money he lost. If Le Chiffre loses, he'll be at the wrong end of his employer's wrath; Bond must win so as to tempt Le Chiffre into getting sanctuary in England, where MI6 could then possibly extract vital information from Le Chiffre, with his safety in return. Casino Royale's story is elaborate enough to keep viewers interested; it's not merely about a terrorist syndicate, but the impending romance story between Bond and, ally, Vesper Lynd. While not a reader of the James Bond novels, I cannot vouch for the authenticity of the film, but its best to see both the novels and films as two different entities, still Casino Royale has one of the more intense stories in James Bond history. Sadly, it lingers on for a little too long as a result of romantic flairs between Bond and Vesper. Also the traditional opening sequence, with accompanying theme song: 'You Know my Name'  Chris Cornell, is a visual feast of stylised cartoon-like animations (albeit the female silhouettes) which left my skin cold  absolutely brilliant. The ending is just as exceptional, especially since it's the only scene that truly is James Bond.Acting is exceedingly good for a James Bond title. Daniel Craig excels as both pre-James Bond, and James Bond. However, he only does so because of the grittier Bond who the viewer is exposed too  he's willing to get his hands dirty with hand-to-hand killing if necessary, and Craig suits this. If Brosnan had been recast, he would seem out of sorts in this film. Eva Green (Vesper Lynd) is a great aid to Craig and their flirting is easily chemistry in motion. Mads Mikkelsen (Le Chiffre) acts well enough to allow for friction between Daniel Craig ( James Bond) and himself  the poker scenes should be noted. Lesser roles such as Judi Dench (M) and Jeffrey Wright (Felix Leiter) yield fine support acting, which really brings the Bond universe to life.Complimenting the acting is some awesome action sequences. Casino Royale sports not only some of the best action seen in a James Bond title, but also in cinema in general. Every scene is dynamic, and you'll be able to feel the intensity, especially at a certain torture scene. However, there seems to be too much chasing, none with car mined you, and not enough firefights, but this isn't a distraction to the overall performance of the movie as a whole. But while exciting actions scenes are always popular, that doesn't make them the better scenes in the film  the shower scene involving a distraught Vesper is simply masterful. However the film is not without its faults: the film drags on a little too long in areas, and the flowing pace becomes noticeably disrupted. There's a lack of the expected gadget repertoire of Bond's, and his newly fashioned Aston Martin DBS spends mere minutes on screen till dismally destroyed into nothingness. Perhaps the biggest problem I had with Casino Royale was that at times I had to remind myself that this was a James Bond movie. The overall feeling is akin to that of Mission Impossible and the Bourne series, and I couldn't help but feel that Casino Royale seems to be playing a following act, while tying to reinvent the James Bond series. Nevertheless, all those non-believers must believe! Casino Royale galvanises a series which many thought was becoming single minded in its approach, and while it doesn't separate itself from the crowd, Casino Royale is by far one of the best spy flicks to date. Yes, it has its fair share of problems, but none are extreme enough to make big enough dents to hinder what is an overall exciting film, that easily stands on its own two feet when judged against its predecessors. So is Casino Royale the best Bond ever? It deserves such praise. And is Daniel Craig the best Bond ever? Well, he pulls the film through in a truly debonair manner.",9,1,3,1 December 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Finally getting some blood...
","While Bella (Kristin Stewart), Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) continue their heated love triangle as to what is best for Bella's future, the nearby city of Seattle is caught within a mysterious string of killings and disappearances. The Cullen family fears the worse, as they are not sure whether the problem in Seattle is related to Victoria (Bryce Dallas-Howard) or the Volturi but nevertheless, they decide that it is best to take precautions in case they get caught up into a situation they may not be able to control.Eclipse continues the Twilight Saga in a far tighter manner than both its predecessors and this allows for a far more effective use of the Twilight mythology. New revelations are made about the cultures of the vampires and werewolves and this aids the film with a more cemented supernatural feel. Additionally, certain minor characters are allowed to voice their respective pasts: this aids the film's narrative with added character depth as well as giving these characters a vital role in the events to come. The overall narrative is structured reasonably well with two poignant story arcs taking place and ultimately fuse by the end. However, the events in Seattle only provides a simple distraction to the poorly conceived love story which is clearly holding back the series. Thankfully, the love triangle in the film escalates into a stronger conclusion than expected, but that does not stop it being rough around the edges and filled with character development that seems out of place. The romance is also portrayed far too positively with the apparent negative consequences of such oppressive love going unacknowledged. Speaking of which, an apparent theme of selfishness can be ascertained from the primary characters yet it is never utilised strongly enough to help connect the characters. The narrative is commendable, in light of the previous attempts, and definitely a step in the right direction for the final two movies.With added improvement to the story, it seems rather disappointing that the acting of the central three figures continues to just fall short. Stewart continues to proceed in a dull manner and by this stage it may just be what her character is truly like: but scenes of romance are never able to excite as you would expect of the vampire genre. Sure, the intent behind the love which surrounds the characters is understandable but it continues to lack feeling from Stewart though she does build life in the final arc of the plot. Pattinson is not much better but his acts of jealously do admirably convey the sort of sinister nature which belies his character's love: pity the film never plays on this. Lautner continues his surprising performance from New Moon but the script never really allows him to further his contribution. Minor characters continue to strengthen the acting ensemble but it is a pity that those who represent the Volturi, are either limited to a few minutes or are completely absent.Another slight improvement is in regards to the computer animation, which flows slightly better this time around with the live-action; a soundtrack that does not always feel tacked on for commercial profitably as orchestra highlights some of the high moments in the film; and directorial control that makes for a more well-rounded experience in which some decent action sequences are allowed to come to life.Language is in running with previous films with its minimal and tame use. There is no nudity but sexual overtones are slightly stronger in Eclipse than seen in the previous films. The violence factor has been increased rather noticeably, either via implication or actual on-screen events. There is a greater emphasis on action but the lack of blood in death scenes stops it ever being overly violent.The Volturi may not grant second chances, and for the Twilight franchise that is a good thing. Third time lucky it definitely is as Eclipse is a marked improvement over both the original Twilight and New Moon, mostly because the overall quality is better. The narrative has more depth; the actors appear to be getting a grasp of their characters, and all while the balancing of melodrama with action takes place. The story offers interesting depth and developments which ultimately become underused and so it is unfortunate that no facet of the film is really as strong as it should be given this is the third film in the series.",6,5,15,30 June 2010
Valkyrie," An interesting idea backed by a top cast...
","Colonel Stuaffenberg (Tom Cruise) is one of the few men in the Nazi party who feel that their leader, Adolf Hitler (David Bamber), is more a threat to German instead of her saviour. He regrets the oath he took for Hitler and feels a desire to help Germany in any way possible. When a surprise attack on a German camp in Tunisia leaves Stuaffenberg seriously wounded, he becomes recruited into a group bent on killing Hitler at any cost.While based upon real-life events, Valkyrie's soul is that of an action thriller and not a biopic. This is not to say that director Bryan Singer skews history but he merely doesn't try to authenticate the film in its entirety. The most obvious claim to this would be the lack of German accents from the main cast. Besides the German introduction from Cruise, all major characters keep their American or British accents intact. This is by no means problematic for the film, and many other greats have been in the same boat. A recent example is The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas: a stellar film where the cast was easily identifiably for their strong English accents even though they were German. The fact of the manner is, is that authentic accents would not enhance either films' core message, with Valkyrie's being about bravery in an unforgiving situation. The story itself follows a fairly consistent flow with the odd moment being stretched out far longer then it ought to be or a story segment which is not developed enough, such as the lack of screen time to develop the relationship between Stauffenberg and his wife Nina (Carice van Houten) and their children. That said, it should be noted that there is an obvious lack of true twists in the story, unless you have no idea about Operation Valkyrie, but this forms a truly impressive feat from Singer, the story and the actors: there is a genuine feel in the film that there is a chance that Stuaffenberg could actually succeed and this only heightens the suspense.The acting front is laden with experience and it shows. Cruise proves commendable as his role as Stuaffenberg and expresses the same level of vigour he has shown many films before. He is not the most ideal candidate but that does not stop him. However Cruise does have the rare weak moment where his delivery of a certain line comes across as stiff and out of character. The British cast is simply fantastic and virtually faultless. The likes of Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighly and Tom Wilkinson bring a level of believability to the film that could have otherwise been lost and their presence is easily felt. Smaller, though not unimportant, roles go to von Houten, who shows a real sense of love for Stuaffenberg, and Bamber, who is just as every inch as creepy and menacing as the infamous Hitler himself. As noted, the entire cast is impressive and lift the film as a whole.The music ensemble, while not overly memorable, supports the film at all times. The direction is no different. Bryan Singer brings a neat fluidity to the scenes which help the film's pacing but it is evident that he is not confident to allow the story or characters speak for themselves in many situations, and instead of being subtle, prefers to make sure the audience understands everything as it happens. In this respect the film loses much of its intrigue and naturalness.Sex and nudity play no part in the film's proceedings with language being brief, if not strong on the odd occasion. Action sequences show off the violent content but there are far and few, never graphic and is comprises mainly of firearms with a suicide scene.Valkyrie can be considered Tom Cruise's return to cinema, and thankfully the end result is a positive one. He is backed up by a decent storyline and a superb selection of actors. Sure the film could have used with some better pacing, more depth and subtlety; and the lack of German accents do possibly ruin the experience if you allow it to do so, but these problems do not hurt the film in any serious manner. Valkyrie might lack the literary impact to allow it to be phenomenal, but that does not stop it being watchable and exciting.",8,2,3,1 February 2009
