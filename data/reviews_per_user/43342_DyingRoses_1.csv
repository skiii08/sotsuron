Resident Evil: Afterlife," Not a bad sequel to watch
","After watching some tragic sequel movies over the past years, this was one movie that I really liked. The movie isn't great, It starts of slow and ends slow. Nothing special happens but It's worth watching it. As a fan, I've watched all four of the movies and liked them. Maybe because I didn't allow myself to dislike it, but it's far better then some lame movies like Twilight receiving such high praise and achieving more money then a worth while movie like this. The action scenes aren't that bad either. The fight scenes start with a bang and ends with another bang. Milla's facial expression and her tone is the same through out the movies, she acts like a dead soul, but in the place she lives, I think that's just about right. I liked the movie, It was not bad at all. Thumb ups from me. Will hope for yet another sequel..",6,2,6,29 December 2010
