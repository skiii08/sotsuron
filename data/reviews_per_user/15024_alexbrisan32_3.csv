Skyfall," Great movie, although a little degree of predictability is present.
","First of all, this Bond is surely made to amaze you even if you aren't a big Bond fan and/or lover. Having seen all Bond movies, I have to say that there are some little details which really give you a deja vu relating to other movies in the series. The Introductive part of the movie is set in Istanbul. It doesn't have the charm and sensation which it gave in From Russia with Love. But times change and so does Bond(it isn't anything new that Craig is much more of a dry Bond than the others, but this is his style and we all have to accept it). The credit sequence is really nice, the idea of seeing Bond during it sort of reminds you of Die Another Day, but the rest of the movie is as opposite to Die Another Day as it could be. It really is surprising for me to see that really no action at all is placed in the U.S.A. I really think it is a great choice. The locations remind me of those old Bonds like Dr.No, The Man with the Golden Gun and so on, which were really trend-setting in my opinion. To get back to the movie, it deals with a very interesting point of view : Modern Asia. It sort of brings the old Bonds back into the modern times, also giving it a bit of retro- style. Let's talk about the villain. Silva. I think there is really just one way to describe Javier Bardem's performance: The best bond villain ever. Exquisite acting. Just extraordinary. Is it enough? I don't think so, but i do not want to stretch my review unnecessary. As a matter, i wouldn't be surprised to see Skyfall with quite a view Oscar nominations next year... The finale : The location for the finale located in that lovely welsh? Scottish? house. It's OK all in all, but the credibility has to suffer a bit from the action scenes. Now just a few finishing touch about some characters: M : I think that the end of Judy Denchses performance has been exquisite. It is credible, and it doesn't surprise so much as changing M's in other movies. Q : Lovely performance, maybe a bit to dry. I don't think that the one toping Desmond Llewlyn is born. Mallory : For bond fans, it was quite predictable that Judy's character would die, letting him to become the new M. Eve (Moneypenny) : I really became happy when i heard Eve Moneypenny. Not only do we now the full name of Miss Moneypenny, but the character itself is lovely. To put it all in a nutshell, i have 2 conclusions: 1) It is a very good movie. I don't know whether it beats Goldfinger, but time will see(And i would say that it for sure is as good as Goldfinger). 2) It would have been great as the first Bond movie in the series.",10,5,19,3 November 2012
The Shining," Good movie, quite entertaining
","This movie is in my opinion a very good one. Not only does the movie entertain you for the whole period in which you watch it, but it also makes you think quite a few days about it after the end. I have to say that what some regard as continuity errors I regard as Kubrick's genius. This means that all the disappearing furniture and impossible architectural layouts are meant to disillusion the viewer and to give the hotel a truly alive character. I must admit that I am a big Jack Nicholson fan and this movie does not disappoint. Thus, it is just normal to say that all cast members played beautifully, creating a true psychological thriller. Summing up, I think that the movie overall is OK, but it would be unfair to give it ten stars(reserved IMO for the Godfather etc) because it simply can't live up to those standards. P.S. There is however a minor glitch at the beginning of the movie, where you can see the camera helicopter.",10,0,1,7 June 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," All in all a pretty good movie, but....
","As i already said in my summary, the movie was pretty good, and i also think that there were some elements which may have surprised some of the viewers, but i'll talk about that later. I think i have only one bad point for this movie, but i'm not sure if it was the movie or the cinema... I watched the movie in '3D', but the only things that were 3d were the ads BEFORE the movie, and some very short scenes in the movie. I didn't like that at all. To be quite frankly, though i secretly hoped that Harry would survive, i was quite expecting him to die. I don't know, but they said that some 'amazing deaths' would appear, but i didn't find it amazing that Freddie(i think), Snape, Bellatrix, or Voldemort all died. However, Part1 made you expect that Severus was the bad one, but as i understood he was the good one. I think that the directors were a bit too cruel when they told harry that Dumbledore was a bit of a bad guy. There also are a couple of thing which i really liked about this movie: 1. I think that the graphics were amazing, respect for those who did the image editing. 2. Another interesting part is that in my opinion the producers made up the question whether or not James Potter is Harrys father, because at some point there are mentioned some similarities between Snape and Harry. 3. I was also expecting that if Harry would Survive, he would become the next Headmaster of Hogwarts, but instead he seems o haven a pretty normal Muggle life(come on?!). In my opinion, the most funny part of the entire movie is at the end, where Harry with Ginny and Ron with Hermione bring their children to Hogwarts. The funny thing is that Harry's Son is Called Albus Severus Potter, which in my opinion is interesting, because if it were after the name, he would be the greatest magicians of all time.",10,2,2,14 July 2011
