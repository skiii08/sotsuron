The Equalizer," Quintessential Denzel Washington!
","For those of you, like me, who like a real action flick every now and then to vicariously live out the life you wish you could lead - this is it! There are a handful of action stars that really deliver the goods from time to time. Denzel Washington is one of them and this is one of his best, if not 'the' best he's ever made. This occurs for many reasons, but here are a few of the prominent ones: writing, acting and the actors involved.The story here isn't new, but when vengeance is don't right - it's to be savored. It's nice when a veteran actor like Denzel doesn't stray too far from what got him in Hollywood's A-LIST to begin with.If you like action flicks and love Denzel Washington this movie will not disappoint. It's perfect on many levels. Special recognition must go to Chloë Grace Moretz for her superb performance!",Null,0,3,16 January 2015
Deja Vu," Awesome Action/Sci-Fi
","Wow. What is it about Denzel Washington that's so lovable on the big screen? The guy is just fantastic. Everything he touches seems to be gold. His acting style is never over the top - and never dull - just seems to be perfect.I watched this movie again for the second time tonight in 2015. I'm more impressed this time than the first. How's that possible? Perhaps it's been a lifetime since Hollywood's produced a great Sci-Fi movie. Denzel Washington and Sci-fi?? What?? Yes, this is 100% Sci-Fi and does a damn good job. I've seen it all. I'm a trekkie, computer geek - you name it - i'm it. I know my Sci-Fi. This has a great story, great acting and a great villain. It's everything a great movie should be.Don't hesitate. Watch this immediately. Even if you're not that much of a Sci-Fi fan, this still has enough to offer to keep anybody engaged and happy all the way through. Absolutely loved it!",Null,2,4,6 November 2015
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Everything a Movie Should Be!
","Hollywood occasionally gets it right. With so many 'misses' - one really becomes guarded when watching the newest million dollar speculation coming from the west coast, but rest assured, 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' is the real deal. It's everything a fantasy movie should be. Wild, creative, well filmed, well written and most of all FUN! I found myself referencing WikiPedia multiple times while watching this movie, mostly for fun - but for factual accuracy too. Interestingly, they wove several real elements of Lincoln's life into the fantasy. Kudos! If you're looking for a fun, face paced - well written blockbuster from Hollywood, look no further. This movie has it all.",Null,0,1,6 May 2013
Balls of Fury," Easily One of the Best Comedies I've Seen Ever!!
","I can't believe this title has a rating of 5.3. Is it the best movie you'll ever watch? Probably not. Is it a really, really funny movie that rivals ANYTHING funny out of Hollywood in the last 10 years? Yes!!!This movie is hysterical. What fantastic lines Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant wrote. I like this movie so much I bought it. I've watched this movie at least 7 times. It always delivers. I'm not going to give you the usual summary. You can read that above. What I will tell you is, if you like smart, intelligent comedy - with a little fun slapstick throw in, you'll love this movie. Dan Fogler is not one of the top 10 paid comedic actors in Hollywood, but you would never know it by his performance in this movie. He delivers more than any top comedy actor I've seen in the last five years. George Lopez is hilarious and gives one if his best performances ever. Maggie Q is phenomenal, funny AND gorgeous. Thomas Lennon, however, steals the show as German Karl Wolfschtagg. The performance he gives here is easily in my top-10 comedic performances of all-time. Yes, that good. The man is funny!Please ignore the rating on this movie. IMDb is usually pretty accurate, but I've found every once in awhile a gem falls under the radar. This movie is one of them. Is it for everyone? Maybe not. But if you like your comedy raw and in your face - you'll love this. If you like DEF LEPPARD, you'll love this!",Null,3,4,6 October 2016
Ex Machina," Really Wanted To Like This One...
","As the title suggests, I was really hoping for so much more. But it became apparent about thirty minutes in (the dreaded thirty minute crossroads) that this was not going to be a memorable movie, just another tossed on the pile of 'ugh'.I love science fiction - and I love science fiction movies that have great scripts and most importantly take me to places I haven't been before (e.g. 'Contact'). AI is a good topic, but I'm still waiting for Hollywood to create a movie that does it justice. Sadly this movie seems to meander at times, slowly without any serious direction resulting in a loss of interest. In addition, the movie's focus is on the characters and not so much the science fiction element itself. This would not be horrible if you enjoyed, or found engaging, any of the characters - but for me that didn't happen. I found them to be either cliché or stale.The special effects were good, but minimal. The ending was anti-climatic. I think this could have been an interesting film with the right script. Unfortunately, it didn't happen.",Null,3,6,27 July 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," Best Written Movie I've Seen in a Long Time!
","Love Tom Cruise, hate Tom Cruise - you have to admit - the guy picks good movies to be in (well, most). I'll even go so far as to say he does what he does (e.g. action, hero, etc.) really well! He hit gold on this one. What makes this movie fantastic is the writing. It's nothing short of genius. I haven't seen writing like this for a very long time.You have to appreciate the thought that went into this movie. Cruise is the A-LIST actor that ties together this great effort on so many levels. You kind of wonder if 'Oblivion' wasn't his first attempt at science fiction greatness. Sadly, that movie fell short. Happily, he didn't give up and gave us this solid movie to enjoy for a long time to come.Writing A+, Special effects A, acting A, overall A!",Null,1,4,13 October 2014
Kingpin," Best Comedy I Have Ever Seen
","I take my comedy seriously (no pun intended). I grew up watching the original cast of SNL, three stooges and actors like Gene Wilder. They all had something special, and I think remain extremely special 30 years later. Kingpin has that rare 'something special'. I had to watch this movie a few times before I fully appreciated the 'once in a lifetime' performances by Harrelson and Murray, and outstanding writing by the Farrelly brothers.This movie, unlike most other comedies I've seen, continually provides genuinely funny moments throughout the entire movie. There are very few comedies I have ever watched that I can say the same about. It's like all the stars in the sky aligned for one perfect moment and in that moment they filmed 'Kingpin'.Now, this film may not be for every one. It's crude, rude and in your face comedy. It's typical Farrelly brother fare. If you like that, or even if you don't and just like the silly comedy of Bill Murray (before he went all serious) - then this movie is well worth a watch. Definitely a 10 out of 10 in my book.",Null,0,1,19 November 2011
The Big Short," Fantastic, and Important, Movie
","I know a lot of people take issue with Hollywood, but without them, common, everyday, people like me would never see a movie like this that explains how so many where robbed and stolen from in America.Normal people simply do not have the insight, or time, to follow what's going on in places like Wall Street. This is why it's important for our government to oversee and audit activities happening in places that can affect everyone. Elizabeth Warren is a HERO for taking on Wall Street. We need more people like her.This movie tells a story of greed. A story of how a few felt it was more important to become rich than think about the security and safety of thousands. America should never again turn a blind eye to such activity. We should learn from our mistakes and put in place laws and security measures to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. To do this, we need to remove money from politics so politicians we elect can do what they are elected to do: protect the people that elected them.This is a fantastic, and important, movie. Everyone should watch this.",Null,1,1,15 March 2016
Get Him to the Greek," Very, Very Good Movie!
","It doesn't take very long to realize this movie is written really, really well. Not only is the humor top notch (actually really funny), but the story and characters are written without flaw. Acting is superb. Russell Brand and Rose Byrne are about as good as it gets in a flick like this, and Jonah Hill gives one of the greatest performances of his career. The surprise actor in this movie is actually Sean Combs. He really nails his character as a record company exec and adds some nicely placed humor and counter-play to the fun Brand and Hill are having.As a musician myself, this movies really hits home several times. The relationship that evolves between Brand and Hill is true movie magic. Chemistry, writing and scenes all intermingle to create one of the best and funniest movies ever made. I highly recommend this movie.",Null,1,2,8 August 2015
Annihilation," So much potential wasted...
","I rely on IMDB to tell me if a movie is any good or not. For the 'most part' - movie ratings here are accurate. However, I'm bewildered as to why this movie holds a '7' at this writing. Me thinks there's something awry at IMDB...With that said... I had such high hopes for this movie. I love SCI-FIs in general, and especially love when movie writers venture out beyond the usual four or five themes we have all been inundated with for years. Sadly, the writers squander their opportunity. Long, drawn out segments going nowhere - boring dialog - and at times overly explicit and graphic scenes just kill any hope you have of a great movie. The ending still has me scratching my head. Do yourself a favor and watch something else.",Null,1,2,30 May 2018
