Casablanca," VERY overrated
",OK.. I don't understand why people praise this as the best movie of all time? I just don't find anything special in this movie. The film starts real sloooooooow and I almost fell asleep waiting for Bogart's character to appear and I waited half an hour for Ingrid's character to appear. A real disappoinment!,1,31,111,20 July 2001
Gone with the Wind," I love this movie!
","Gone With The Wind is so wonderful, it's hard to believe it was made in the 30s. What I like most about this film is that the characters are so real that you think you know them personally. GWTW is about Scarlett O'Hara. She loves Ashley, but Ashley is married to his cousin, Melanie. So she married Melanie's brother Charles( a total loser) in spite. The war started, so the men goes off to fight and Charles died two weeks later. Scarlett moved in with Melanie in Atlanta. She ruined her reputation dancing with Rhett. Then more stuff happened. The plot is quite simple, but the strong characters saves this film along with other things. The music is great, the sceneries are nice, and the costumes are the best. Oh, did I mention that the acting is to near perfection by all the cast?",10,1,2,20 July 2001
