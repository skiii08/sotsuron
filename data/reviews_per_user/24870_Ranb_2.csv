Catch Me If You Can," I guess crime does pay.
","A movie based on a book, which in turn was BASED on the life of Frank Abignale.  While I obviously do not know enough about Abignale to comment on the things he has done in his life, I do have something to say about the movie.  The movie was definitely not a waste of my time to sit through.  It was rather enjoyable entertainment.  Watching a man transform himself to get what he wants is interesting.  The movie does give a glimpse into the working of check fraud and getting around the system. 
It also shows a man who thinks little of stealing, whether from banks or other companies.  A man who gladly puts himself in the position as a doctor and attorney even though he has no idea what he is doing and can wreck the lives of the patients/people who are counting on him.  I'd have to say he got off light.  The movie does not say if he made restitution to the people that he defrauded.  According to Spielberg, crime does pay.RB",Null,0,0,28 December 2002
Troy," Only 'inspired by', not based on the Iliad.
","And too bad for that.  Homers poem was gutted to make this 3 hour movie. While it stands by itself well enough for a $9 ticket and three hours in the theater, it could have been much better.  Imagine a movie based on the Bible without Christ, angels, or miracles.  Or Lord of the Rings without magic or wizards.  The ten year war seems to be boiled down to a month. 
Achilles never really gets a scratch on him even though he is in the thick of a battle full of spears and swords, never mind that he is not revealed to be the son of a Goddess or wearing armor forged by the Gods.  He is only a mere mortal here.  For anyone who read the poems or is familiar with the stories, there is too much missing.   6/10.",Null,1,2,15 May 2004
