3:10 to Yuma," Better Late than Never
","This movie has been my watchlist for a long time, and again I've got the chance to watch it serendipitously. I didn't have much expectation, the only thing I wanted to see a mediocre western movie, but it turned out a immersive and exciting movie. 
 
 Christian Bale and Russell Crowe successfully live up to what I expected from them with their well-depicted characters. I don't want to expatiated on their performance, you'll understand why they are considered among the top actors when you see the movie.  Scenario, I can assure you about non-stop action, after some point it doesn't start to make much sense still you continue watch it because of its mesmerizing atmosphere. And there are some illogical decisions that make you think about for a while, probably this is the reason why the some don't like the movie.",8,1,2,11 March 2018
Get Out," Thrilling but Overrated
","I'd been postponing to watch this movie for a long time. Not having found any interesting movie as I wanted, finally I decided to see if it's a good movie as much as the people say. At first I thought that it was going to have a cerebral scenario but it does have a very straightforward one. As you now, Daniel Kaluuya was nominated for Oscar, but he didn't get it. I didn't think he would anyway. But I have to admit that, he remarkably acted well. You can feel the emotions and anxiety through his eyes. I'm a bit surprised to see his unexpected performance.  The scenario is Achilles heel, the movie was relatively short and this may be the main cause why you feels so empty when the credits begin to roll. I don't want to give any spoiler but the less expectation you have the more joy you have is how I can summarize the movie.",7,1,2,6 March 2018
The Dark Knight," This is the Best...
","It's one of the best films I've watched in years...By the way, this movie is not overrated, it deserves the hype it gets, ESPECIALLY heath ledgers performance, whether he died or not. (R.I.P.), his performance is absolutely phenomenal.Nolan, has squeezed enough material for a saga into two and a half hours. The action moves insanely fast, the exposition is breathless, and the big setpieces practically tread on each other's heels. Down time doesn't exist in this film. Dark, mysterious and pulsating almost from start to finish, Batman's return to the big screen has set a new benchmark for the superhero film, leaving the plethora of recent comic book capers firmly in its wake. Shortly characters, atmosphere, dialogs, music, action, depth... Everything is perfect! Thank you Christopher Nolan, for giving us this epic trilogy.",10,1,5,22 September 2014
12 Strong," Just An Average Hollywood War Movie
","When I first saw this movie, I thought there would be an ordinary, cliched and boring movie. I was mostly right, except for the atmosphere. They did one hell of a job to give this atmosphere. But scenario isn't good enough to keep grabbing your attention. It reached the climax too early and after that it got boring and boring especially the final battle scene is really long and you might just want to leave the theater. Visual, sound effects and Chris Hemsworth are really good. Even being based on a true story doesn't make it immersive or engaging, it makes it just one of tens of movies similar to each other. It's a classic the US saves everyone movie. Nevertheless, if you don't have another option, it will be worth your time.",7,4,12,31 March 2018
