Angels & Demons," True disappointment
","I have been a true fan of Dan Brown's books for some time now, and I sincerely looked forward to this movie as much as I did with the 'Da Vinci code'. The thrill I had reading them, the shear detail of the books as well as the nerve racking turns in the end made them jump high up in my top ten books of all time. I couldn't wait, and I followed the production from the start! Alas, as with the 'Da Vinci Code' I was disappointed even from the first minutes. Now, I did not expect the movie to be completely like the book, and I of course knew some minor details would have to be taken out, but come on! It is like they took the book, ripped the pages apart and just scrambled the film back on random. There were such moments in the book that I was looking forward to that had just been taken out and tossed out the window. The start was different, the middle was different, the story was different.. Even the characters were different. There were some quotes that I actually got chills from while reading the book, and to be honest, it's a freaking book. It's not supposed to give me those sensations. A movie maybe, but a book? No no. But since I did get this sensation of awe, I was sure it would be multiplied by a tenfold in the movie. I got chills once. And that was when it said the title at the start of the movie. For me this movie was true disappointment. You may flame me all you like, but Mr. Howard, you have already ruined two books for me. Don't ruin another now. These were my thoughts on the movie, and I am sure someone else loved it. If so good for you, if not, I completely understand.",3,3,5,2 July 2009
