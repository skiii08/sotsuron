50 First Dates," Never mind the sucky parts, this is what love is
","See, I am a married man. And watching this movie, at home on the sofa with my wife whom I love above anything and hopefully always will, almost brought me to tears and easily did her. This movie, no matter all the overdone/overacted characters and the fact that Adam Sandler is probably the worst person in the world the act crying, is simply the best description of love ever. To have the energy to every day win over the heart of the one you love, is what we all should do, though ever so often don't have the energy to.I believe that movie criticism often nitpicks too much on technical details or other such stuff of -actually- little importance. Show me a person who is not moved by this film and I show you a person who knows zip about real love. Real, I mean. I am not a religious person and this made me feel closer to what people often call God, whatever that is. Maybe I exaggerate, but I want to. And no work of art, of any genre, can be asked to do any more. On scale of 1 to 10, this goes to 11. (Can you see?!)",10,334,388,19 November 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," From fear to joy
","Having read the book 10+ times I was hopeful yet in agony to see the Fellowship. Will Jackson be up to the task, how will the actors perform, what have they done with the Balrog and such... I'm sure many others felt the same way. By the end of the movie I was in tears, as it was as good, or actually far better than I had ever hoped a LOTR movie could be.The story was well composed, the world was artfully yet realistically created and the feelings of die-hard fans well taken into consideration by small sidelines of the screenplay (Magot, Bill etc.) Later to see the full version on DVD made it even better, as has been the case with all parts of the trilogy. If the old half-animation was a brave failure, this was a brave effort that succeeded.",10,5,8,30 June 2005
