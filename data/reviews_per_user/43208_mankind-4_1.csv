Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Any Fan of the Series Should Love It
","Don't listen to the critics, they were just waiting for this to come out so they could bash it.  Once Episodes II and III are released, everyone will realize that Phantom Menace is as good of start as any.  It truly is a great movie, aside from a slightly slow opening and Jar Jar Binks, who is annoying as hell.  9 out of 10.",9,0,1,19 May 1999
