Antz," Big kids stuff
","An animation film that makes the la-la Disney films look sillier than ever. At last, we, the big guys, can enjoy an animated pictures movie, without the idiotic patronizing plots we've seen in the past. Stunning animation techniques, tech of the next century and, above all, the sheer pleasure, we've experienced many times as 10-year-olds, of getting out of ourselves and be there, on the big screen - the stars of the picture! We' re waiting for the next big kids animation.",9,0,0,26 November 1998
