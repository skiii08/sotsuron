Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Deleted Scenes?
","I greatly enjoyed the movie, but I was upset that it was supposedly missing some scenes.Scene #1  Borat visits a doctor and explains to him that he has herpes, and has slept with his sister.Scene #2  Borat is in the super market looking at the various types of cheese.Scene #3  Borat gets stopped by the police in Dallas.Scene #4  Borat gets arrested for looking like a terrorist between the Mexico/California borders.Scene #5  Borat participates in a civil war reenactment.Scene #6  Borat photographs a man in the urinal.I am sure there are more scenes but these are all that I could find that were not in National release of the movie, but were in the sneak peek or screenings.-Jason",8,1,5,6 November 2006
