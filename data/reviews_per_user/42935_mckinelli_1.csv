Alien 3," One of the best movies in the history of motion pictures
","It is among the 5 best movies in the history of Cinema. I can watch it for 100 times, I never get tired of watching it again, and each time I find a new gem in it. It is simply a masterpiece. The last scene, when Ripley dives into the melting pot, has been etched in my memory forever. The music combines so well with the scene. Everything is perfect, not many scenes in the history of cinema could match it. When the little alien breaks out through her chest, she is exactly like a mother, giving birth to a monster. For a woman that has never given birth, this is her first and last child. She catches it in her hand, for a moment it looks like she loves this newborn, and then both of them die forever.The colony is so bizarre. The personalities, how they interact are perfect. The scene where they are sending the corpse to her fiery grave, where the black man starts to talk about life and death, combined with the birth of the alien, is another masterpiece.The doctor character is also interesting. I only wish they could have left him alive a bit more. He could add a lot more to the later scenes.The scenes of carnage by the alien in the dark tunnels, the photography is amazing and magnificent. When it chases the inmates and they run away, the camera work, how it runs through the corridors, is great.The scene where she brings back the humanoid to life and talks to him is one of the most horrible and at the same time heart breaking scenes I have ever seen.To put it in a nutshell, the photography is splendid, the music combines superbly, the story about these quasi-monks and criminals is strong and thrilling. I rank it among the 5 best movies in the history of cinema and always astounded why it is so under-rated. it is a forgotten gem.",10,4,7,1 July 2002
