Miracle," One of the best I've seen in a long time
","The hockey action was awesome.  Normally sports movies are a turn-off because the actors look horrible trying to be athletes.  This was different.Also, the director's precision matching of the original play-by-play with the movie's ice action is flawless.With surround sound at the theater, you feel like you are in the arena during the action.  You root for USA, hate the Soviets (just like old times), recall that horrible period we had in the late '70s and remember that there was something special through it all at Lake Placid.",10,0,0,13 February 2004
