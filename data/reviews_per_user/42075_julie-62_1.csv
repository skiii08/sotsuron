The Blair Witch Project," What a way to waste an afternoon...
","I'm going to credit the creators of Blair Witch Project with a brilliant marketing scheme.  It definitely had me hook, line and sinker.  Unfortunately, the movie only went downhill from there.  I kept waiting for something scary to happen and it never quite did.  I was creeped out a couple times, and the acting was okay, but for the most part, I found it simply dull and plodding, with no resolution whatsoever at the end.",Null,0,1,1 August 1999
