Catch Me If You Can," Very fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying!
","I watched this movie on DVD last night--what a pleasant surprise!  Well, I can't imagine any movie with Spielberg as director and Tom Hanks/Leo DiCaprio as lead actors to be anything less than good, but not having seen the trailer to the movie nor read reviews of it I wasn't sure what kind of a film to expect.  Knowing that this movie is based on real life events of Frank Abagnale Jr. makes it all the more enjoyable to watch, while I cannot stop myself from wondering how on earth he was able to pull it all off--as pilot, doctor, and lawyer.  I'm sure he must have run into some difficulties at times with his pretense, yet he must have been able to react quickly and avert near-disasters until the time he's finally caught.  I really liked his character as DiCaprio portrayed him, despite the fact that the essence of what he did was wrong.  Tom Hanks, as usual, did an excellent job--I ended up liking his character as well even though he started off being rather dislikeable.  Christopher Walken also wins high points for his portrayal as the senior Abagnale, bringing a certain dignity and believability to his character that wins our empathy in spite of his shady dealings and troubles with the IRS.  In short, I ended up liking just about everything in this movie.  It was a very well-presented story and a well-acted drama, with humour sprinkled in just the right amounts and at the right places, in my opinion.  The pace is just fast enough to keep me entertained and thinking at all times, without loosing me in any overly convoluted subplots.  Kudos to Spielberg for such a fun, clever, and intellectually satisfying piece of film-making!",8,1,2,18 October 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Does 'Crouching Tiger' live up to its hype?
","The phrase 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' refers to an age-old Chinese idiom that says society is full of dangerous people, like hidden tigers and dragons ready to pounce on the unsuspecting victim. The story of the movie revolves around lovers Li Mu-bai (Chow) and Yu Shu-lien (Yeoh), two Chinese warriors who have strong feelings for each other but have not had the opportunity to express them. The theft of Li's prized sword leads them to Jen Yu (Zhang), a nobleman's daughter who is about to be betrothed in a pre-arranged marriage but whose young mind is rebellious and dreams of being a warrior. The quest to recover the lost sword precipitates numerous extremely well-choreographed fight scenes (by Woo-ping Yuen) true to the Chinese martial arts or 'Wu-xia' genre. Most notable are the two scenes where Yu chases the masked Jen up walls (literally) and over rooftops, and where Li fights with Jen amidst treetops, respectively. The two female leads, Yeoh and Zhang, steal the spotlight most of the time. Yeoh is effective in conveying her suppressed emotions with subtlety and nuance, while Zhang gives a strong performance as the untamed 'hidden dragon' who ultimately seeks escape from her conflicting emotions through death. While some believe this film to be overhyped, North American audiences seem to love it. For some of us familiar with the 'Wu-xia' genre, however, this film may fall short of our (fairly high) expectations.",8,0,0,12 January 2001
