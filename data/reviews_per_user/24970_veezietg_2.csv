Kill Bill: Vol. 2," You just have to get it...
","Anyone who is a fan of Mr. Tarantino's understanda what he did with KILL BILL VOLS. I + II. In the first one we get an action movie, a movie that sucks you in to a world of revenge. It makes you a spectator in a series of wonderfully violent murders. It makes you wonder whose side you're on. It brings you to the very essence of antici...(WAIT FOR IT)...pation when it ends. Then came VOL. II. We don't know what to expect. All we know when leaving the theater last fall is that there's the daughter, who's alive, and there's her father, who's gonna die. I felt that the movie didn't need to suck you in to an emotional love story. You don't need to cry at the end. If that's what you want go see MY GIRL, or some such nonsense. What you need to remember always with these movies is that their originality is equal to their satire. That these 2 movies are Q's homage to the movies that many of us grew up watching. I, as much as anyone, would pretend I was Bruce Lee in my bedroom. I'd practice kicking and punching imaginary bad guys with my 'kung fu.' And after seeing KILL BILL VOLS. I + II, I found myself doing that again in my living room. KILL BILL VOL. II is the sort of movie that can only be taken lightly by serious fans. Its the sort of film that makes you wonder why action movies ever began going for drama. The fight scenes in KILL BILL VOL. II are a little less over the top. But thats what makes them great. After you kill the peons in a video game you don't want to keep fighting them when you're trying to beat the boss. With the less dramatic fight scenes you have a chance to see the movie for its true worth. You get to take a breath and see that these characters were very well crafted. And each intricate detail in the movie is made more precious by not being dominated by Stallone/Schwartzenegger crap. I loved this movie more than any of Tarantino's other movies, which is saying a helluva lot since I own every single one. You either get it or you don't. You don't have to be a fan of old movies to understand these 2, anymore than you had to be a fan of oldies music to laugh at some very sick scenes in RESEVOIR DOGS. This is the beauty of Tarantino. Now, seeing this beloved cult classic icon on American Idol is a whole different story...",Null,1,3,22 April 2004
Van Helsing," Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker are turning in their graves!
","I won't say that I had no expectations going in. I did. And coming out I thought, 'Everyone knows that Mina Harker was instrumental in the death of Dracula.' And when I look at it from a non-biased view point, I really must say... it still blew! The movie lost me when Jekyll/Hyde showed up. I thought, 'Oh look, deleted scenes from A League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.' Then the so-called 'plot twists' kept getting worse and worse. How many movies does Kate Beckinsale need to be in that are werewolves vs. vampires? And how many roles does Hugh Jackman need where he has chops and Berserker claws? While the graphics and action sequences were entertaining, the acting seemed over the top and a little too comical to do anything but hurt the movie. Dracula was unsexy, his brides were just 90210 bitches with wings, and the whole vampire offspring twist seemed a little like it was the idea of a desperate Red Bull drinking writer. I thought most of it could have been done much better without changing it too much. And the rest would have sucked no matter what. Dracula met Van Helsing at a completely different era than the one in which Dr. Frankenstein was making his monster. And the Roman war 'Gabriel' made reference to which was sited in the movie as being 73 b.c. was actually about 200 a.d. It all gave the impression that it was made too fast to be anything but what it was, a bad movie with good enough action scenes to gross billions. I just hope that money helps the makers sleep at night, cos it wouldn't help if it were me.",Null,0,0,13 May 2004
