Walk the Line," Simply fabulous!
","My family and I went to see 'Walk The Line' and we all loved it! I have to say - it's the best movie I've seen in a long time. This is very easily Reese Witherspoon's best performance ever! She was fabulous playing June Carter Cash. Joaquin Phoenix was awesome as Johnny Cash also! I loved this movie so much that we had to run to WalMart afterwards to get the soundtrack and a couple of Johnny's cd's. I also have to say I think Joaquin and Reese sing way better than Johnny and June. Wow, they could have potential singing careers if they wanted to. Bravo! The movie is getting high ratings, so it's not just me who liked this movie. Go check it out. You won't be disappointed! :)",10,0,3,30 November 2005

How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Excellent movie!
","This movie was *much* better than I had thought it would be.  I expected a so-so film, but it was super funny and entertaining.  The whole audience was laughing all the way thru the movie.  This is the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  Highly recommended!",10,0,0,8 February 2003
Scary Movie 2," JUST PLAIN AWFUL !!!
","Avoid this DUMB movie like the plague!  Unless, of course, you think hearing the 'F' word in almost every sentence, repeated disgusting puke scenes, and a lame sense of humor is funny.  I was also repulsed by the sacriligious scenes.  (i.e.  A priest having sex with a demon-filled evil woman, for one example)  I have to give this one an F-",8,0,1,18 July 2001
