Sucker Punch," Preposterously bad
","If this film was two hours of sexy people with guns and samurai swords hacking up steam-punk zombie Nazis I would have had no trouble with it whatsoever. 300, another film by Snyder is unashamedly trashy but brilliant. What so annoyed me was the way this filmed attempted to pass itself off as a meaningful and moving examination of the human condition. The various parallel realities involved, the appallingly cheesy,forced, 'poignant' dialogue between the girl and the stupidly predictable cardboard-cutout characters were truly painful to watch. I guess I found this film so infuriating because it tried to deny what it was: an otherwise really enjoyable but brainless romp with some really fantastic CGI and wonderfully ridiculous, over-the-top fight-scenes. If not for these (which were very entertaining) it would get 1 star. No doubt many people enjoyed this film, hence its pretty reasonable rating, I did not, but that may be just me.",2,4,12,15 April 2011
