Casablanca," I can't believe a I love a black and white movie!
","'I'm shocked, shocked to my foundation that' I love a black and white movie. I NEVER watch black and white movies and my dad finally weared me down and got me to agree to watch it. I was totally expecting to hate it (I wasn't even a big fan of Schindler's List which I thought would be WAY better in color.). Everything about Casablanca was perfect. The characters were all colorful and interesting. The story was powerful. I even got emotional when they start singing the 'free France' song to drown out the Nazi song. Great ending, too, if a tiny bit melodramatic (is that the right word?). I loved the police chief as well. All movie makers should use this is a guide on how to make every character different and interesting. Even if you're skeptical, check it out! Now, they just need to remake it...in COLOR!",10,0,2,8 April 2009
Twilight," I wish I hadn't cancelled the dentist appointment to watch this.
","Ah, where do you begin with something this awful? I have not read the book, so this review is based solely on the merits of the movie itself...and it sucks. I've no doubt if I had read and liked the book, the movie would almost certainly be better even if it didn't live up the expectation of the novel. That said, I never read Harry Potter, either, but enjoy all those films, so the filmmakers of Twilight must have dropped the ball somewhere. I understand the girls think the guy is cute, but the rest of the story is beyond shallow. One of the other comments summed it up perfectly when they asked how a 100+ year old man (in the body of a hot teen boy) finds his intellectual and emotional equal in a 17 year old girl. And she doesn't have anything going for her. She's displaced trailer trash without much of a personality and only modestly attractive. At least make her wicked smart, or have a glowing personality. Yawn. Not enough action, not enough cool vampire stuff, not enough of anything remotely interesting. All I can say is read the book, because the movie is beyond weak.",1,11,147,8 April 2009
