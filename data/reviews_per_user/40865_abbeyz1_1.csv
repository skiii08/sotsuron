Hereditary," Slowly But Surely
","Very slow start. So much so that I had it playing in the background as I read my in-depth astrology readings. I didnt start paying attention until the first incident that was so shocking and crazy I couldnt not watch it.I would classify this as more of a thriller than a horrow movie. Each time a thriller scene comes on, its bery well done. Inbetween each of these scenes are a very slow story telling. However, due to the severity of the first incident, it keeps you engaged regardless of the dauntingly long scenes.",7,0,3,11 May 2019
