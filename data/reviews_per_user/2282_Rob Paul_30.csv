Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What is this?
","15 years is a long time in which to deliver a movie, and finally we are given the Phantom Menace. Regardless of the hype, and even knowing full well that this is a kids movie, it is still a terrible film. However, let's put this into a proper context.Lucas made the movie with his own money, and that's where the problems lie. It's his franchise and he can do whatever he wants. Who's going to argue with him; if they do, he just fires them, right. When you don't have a studio breathing down your neck, you can become extremely lazy, and that's really what this movie is - lazy! All the visual effects in the world still can't save this movie. Here's the top ten problems (out of 50+) I found...1) Visual effects, for visual effects sake. SFX can be good, if used in context with the storyline. How many times did you see a cutaway visual effects scene-setter during the Corruscant scene - about six times. Totally wasteful and pointless.2) Jar Jar Binks. Chewbacca was palatable in Episode 4 because he only made a few groans, but here Jar Jar is a joke. Even the kids in the cinema were bored with his stupidity, but maybe you can forgive this if you could understand what the f*** the thing was saying. He totally spoils every scene he is in.3) Gungan shields. Okay you can't fire through them, but you can walk through the shield - what the ???? 4) Are these robots (army of) the dumbest things ever invented. Firstly, they can't even aim properly. Secondly, they need a Control Ship to function - what, they don't have enough memory, or they can't be remotely programmed???. This is the worst plot device nonsense I've seen since ID4.5) Videogames - the only point to the pod-race seemed as an excuse for a videogame tie-in. And guess what, Pod Racer is in stores now...6) Acting - even crap lines can be delivered with a bit of enthusiasm, but here, first class actors like Neeson looked, frankly, embarrased. McGregor didn't help, delivering his worst screen performance to date.7) Maul - about as scary as an ewok.8) Palpatine - the only British actor who seemed at all to be of any benefit. The real phantom menace.9) Stereotypes - way too many. Opening scenes on the space station - Chinese/Japanese people. Watto - stupid Italian fella. Robots - Rodger Rodger - cross between American/Japanese soldiers of mercy. Jar Jar - Jamaican meesa. What was all that meesa about??? Boss Nass - hah, is this a boss, a fat freak who shakes his jaws like a baby???10) The other 40 problems that I can't be bothered listing...But hey, it's not my money, it's Lucas and he can do what he wants with it. But then, I can think of a million better ways to spend $115 million dollars. I just wish I hadn't put another 5 quid into his coffers.",Null,0,1,21 July 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Best opening sequence ever...
","I remember the opening 10 minutes of this film to be one of the best moments in cinema, where everything just clicked. But as a whole, the movie works on every level and can be enjoyed by everyone. Plain and simply this movie oozes sheer class, including one of the coolest moments in cinema, you know, the part where Jones comes face to face with the Arab wielding swordman...then bang!I'm suprised this movie didn't win many awards, because for sheer adventure and suspense it is top of the class, and holds up extremely well after repeated viewings. Ford has never been bettered in this type of role.9/10.",Null,1,1,2 July 1999
The Big Lebowski," taking it easy
","The Dude is one laid back fella, who breezes through life without a care in the world - except for bowling. But when the Dude is mistaken for another 'Jeffrey Lebowski', well, the Dude has some serious thinking to do.The Coen brothers have come up with another gem of a movie, one which may appear slow moving and lazy, but is never anything less than entertaining. This is due to the hilarious dialogue, and some class acting, especially from John Goodman as Walter. Goodman has always flattered to deceive in his film career, but finally he shows how great a comedy actor he is. You can't help but laugh at some of his lines and mannerisms - 'Bunch of f**** amateurs', 'You're entering a world of pain', 'Donny, you're out of your element' etc.Like all Coen movies, some of the jokes will be missed the first time around. If you're after a great slice-of-life comedy, then look no further. I remember this film wasn't that well received at the box-office, but in Empire (UK) magazine's list of 1998 best films, it managed to come 2nd.9/10.",Null,1,2,8 July 1999
The Mummy," Enjoyable, but maybe for the wrong reasons
","I only saw this movie for one reason - the guy who played Jonathan (John Hannah) used to live in a place called (Murray, East Kilbride, near Glasgow), only 5 minutes from my house, so I had to see how far the 'local boy' had come. I was expecting typical hollywood nonsense, but at least it was fairly enjoyable, a poor-man's raiders of the lost ark, except with much better effects. The director and cast knew when to play for laughs, and the film never reached the 'looking at the watch' time like so many other films these days succumb too. This is also noticeable as the '20 minutes too long' syndrome.If you're after old fashioned hockum, with its tongue firmly in its cheek, you can't do much wrong here.7/10",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
Fargo," Over-rated but still better than most...
","The Coen Brothers can take the simplest plot ideas and weave truly magical movies. Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and the Hudsucker Proxy manage this concept, but Fargo just falls short in some respects. However, that shouldn't detract from what is essentially an extremely well crafted character study.The real key to making this movie work is in the inspired casting. I didn't rate William Macy that much until I seen him in this movie, and he pulls off a performance that really makes you believe in his own predicament and one that should have received more recognition. While the cast are well above average, the movie is really stolen by Frances McDormand, finally bagging a deserved oscar in the process.The only real problems with this movie lie in the pacing, which at times drags the movie down a notch or two. In addition, some scenes seemed out of place and felt added in as a sideshow.Nevertheless, the Coen Brothers always make enjoyable movies, films that while some regard as slow-moving, others can manage to find a depth that is lacking from most movies these days.8/10.",Null,0,0,7 July 1999
Armageddon," Hurt my eyes
","This would have made a great movie if you happened to be a 13 year old - oh, I forgot that's the audience this movie is aimed at. The best thing by far in this movie is Steve Buscemi, and I have to admit the humour in this film was spot-on, like the line about 'American...Russian...all made in Taiwan' - that had me in fits. Too true... Some movies are just meant to be enjoyed, but although I wanted to enjoy this, and I did for the first hour, when those flashing lights/shaking cameras came on for the last hour my head was too sore to bother anymore. Maybe I'm too sensitive to strobing lights.Ach, if your a teenager this is probably the best action movie ever, until the next one comes along...enjoy them while you're young...5/10",Null,0,1,1 July 1999
Face_Off," Not one of Woo's better efforts
","I rate John Woo as one of the best action director's in the world, having seen many of his Hong Kong movies (Killer, Hard Boiled, Better Tomorrow etc). This is Woo's third major hollywood attempt at bringing the 'Woo' characteristics to the fore. And that's the problem - John Woo has made a lot of films and I'm afraid he has ran out of ideas, and those ideas in Face/Off have been done before, only much better.His first american movie (Hard Target) was very subdued and the choice of Van Damme made the film just another run-of-the-mill action movie.Broken Arrow was only slightly better, this time he managed to get a couple of decent actors, but you still feel that Woo doesn't have full directorial control in this movie and it just kind of stumbles towards its predictable conclusion.With Face/Off, you have to be able to suspend your disbelief, but I'm sorry - face and body swapping - er, very hard to believe. Another problem I found was that the movie was too long (about 30 minutes) and Nic Cage really looked embarrassed in some of his scenes.I'm still waiting for a John Woo movie that can approach the quality I know he is capable of. I wonder if his next movie (Mission Impossible 2) will manage this.Face/Off = 5/10.",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
Dark City," Mute the voice-over
","Here's the problem with dark city - the voice over at the beginning. Luckily for me I read a mini synopsis with those very words -'Mute the voice-over at the beginning'. This would have spoiled the movie, but fortunately I muted the voice over and enjoyed the movie all the better for this. Like the Matrix, although more 'noirish' in nature, it is still a captivating movie that is criminally overlooked by many people.8/10.",Null,0,1,1 July 1999
Aliens," Cameron's finest hour
","There must have been a huge amount of pressure on Cameron's shoulders to produce a follow-up movie that could approach the masterpiece that was the Terminator. However, Cameron surpasses this film with what I still consider his finest work. He is one of the few director's who really knows how to build up tension, and with Aliens, even on repeated viewings, he cranks the tension up so high that it is truly a frightening movie.How Sigourney didn't win an Oscar I'll never know. As for Hudson (Bill Paxton) this is probably Paxton's greatest role, just shading his performance in True Lies.10/10",Null,0,1,2 July 1999
Independence Day," Over-rated by a long shot
","How on earth did this film manage to gross over $300 million dollars? From my point of view, it really did seem like a patriotic flag-waving exercise; containing one of the most cringe-worthy speeches ever made. Will Smith didn't help either, but then he is an acquired taste and appeals to a lot of young kids.Bad acting in films like this can sometimes be forgiven, but on this occasion we don't really have anything worth cheering for. The script, while not a disaster, doesn't even manage to inject any originality, only adding one cliche after another. But since this is a movie all about visual splendour, maybe I'm being too hard on it? Well, not really since the CGI effects were only average. However, none of this compares to one of the truly dumbest plot devices ever committed to celluloid - yes, that old virus transmission via the apple mac. Hah, if I were Bill Gates I'd be fuming!This type of movie can be done well, but like the director's previous effort (Stargate), this film sacrifices everything in favour of spectacle, but unfortunately ID4 isn't in the least bit spectacular. Avoid this alien catastrophe, because this ain't even a B-movie, it's more like a D-movie.3/10.",Null,1,2,9 July 1999
Saving Private Ryan," One of the best war movies ever made
","A master class in filmmaking, this contains some of the most brilliantly executed battle sequences ever made. This is one of those rare films that aren't afraid to depict battle in a very realistic manner, managing to show how people can die such senseless and horrible deaths. There is one particular sequence at the beginning of the movie that really numbs you.As an example of the futility of war, it certainly delivers, and the plot concerning saving Private Ryan really concerns the Tom Hanks character, for he is the one who needs saving. The film does have flaws in its narrative, and the middle section is possibly 20 minutes too long, but, taken as a whole, the film is quite an achievement, and surely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. When viewed on video, the one major aspect that will be missed is the ultra realistic sound effects that manage to add a whole new dimension to the battle scenes, making you feel as if you are really there.While this isn't Spielberg's best film, technically it is his most accomplished, and is an example of a filmmaker nearing the peak of his creative abilities. At the Oscars, Spielberg's face said it all - this deserved Best Picture.9/10.",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
The Game," lost the plot
","I like this director. He isn't afraid to take the mickey out of the audience. This movie is a comment on the gullibility of people, on how they will believe any old nonsense - and from the other reviews on this site, the writer and director judged the audience correctly. People were taken in and made to look like complete idiots.Judging by the amount of people who were taken in, which is more than I would have guessed, means the bar has been raised in audiences' suspension of disbelief. It really is amazing how much inconsistency exists in this script. I really have to applaud people for managing to enjoy this, but like the minority out there, we can do without this fluff.As a comment on how much you can take the pi** out of an audience without half of them knowing it, then this movie deserves 10/10. As a film, it requires you to suspend your disbelief beyond what is required.",Null,1,2,7 July 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," Over the top and instantly forgettable
","This is one of Quentin Tarantino's earlier scripts, although this time he passes up directorial duties in favour of acting. The story really is simple - two bank robbers need to cross to Mexico, they kidnap a family and head to the meeting point, which is where the movie becomes an all out vampire action comedy. It's one of those films that is best viewed once only, and then forgotten. The highlight of the movie also happens to be the point that this movie of two-halves comes to life; a very erotic snake dance by Salma Hayek, who is so hot that the screen nearly melts.It's a dumb film, and the script has no pretensions to be anything else (take note of the Pu**y speech by the long-haired dude). Clooney is by far the best thing in it, giving a cooler than cool performance whereas Harvey Keitel seems miscast as the preacher without faith, and Quentin, well, the only time I've liked him as an actor was when he delivered that hilarious pi***ng joke in Desperado.There's gore aplenty, but sometimes the direction is pretty shoddy. Look at some of the scenes where Clooney is giving a mini-speech between bouts of vampire killing - in the background the vampires just seem to be wandering about without any purpose - it's quite cheesy really. If you want to see Clooney hamming it up, then look no further. If you're after something with brains, do not waste your time with this.5/10.",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
Jerry Maguire," Better than many might expect
","In the 90's Tommy Cruise has been the undisputed box-office master, having managed the feat of starring in Five straight $100 million grossing movies (Days of Thunder, A Few Good Men, The Firm, Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire). He can do no wrong, and Cameron Crowe manages to get another superb performance from him, in what is essentially a romantic drama.The film, while relying on a dialogue heavy script, is really about triumph in the face of adversity. This is portrayed through Maguire who at one moment has it all, then the next minute has nothing, and so has to go it alone with one sole client. The Gooding character also faces a very personal battle, trying to salvage a career that is seemingly on a downward spiral. Ultimately, this is a feel good movie, which while clearly aimed at the female audience, is still an extremely professional production that a lot of men probably enjoyed but were frightened to admit it. Gooding thoroughly deserved his Oscar, and the highlight of the movie is still the 'Show me the money' scene. Cameron Crowe is a director/writer to look out for in the future.7/10.",Null,3,9,12 July 1999
There's Something About Mary," A few good scenes don't make a good movie
","'Go see this movie, it's laugh a minute.' Or so they say. $150 million in Box Office revenue must mean there's something good about this, right? Wrong. This movie was painful to watch as one gag after another falls flat and 2 hours seems like 4. A movie probably made more enjoyable in the theatre, rather than on video due to typical gag-points throughout the film. It's like those god-awful laugh reels in 'Friends' etc. Does the audience really need to be *told* what's supposed to be funny. But then again, the one good thing about Mary was that the Old geezer at the end has the last laugh.If you liked Kingpin/Dumb and Dumber - the title says a lot about the intended audience of the movie (another Farrely Brothers joke) - then you'll love this.The Farrely Brother's must be laughing their asses off right now. I suspect they know what the audience expects now, and wouldn't you know it - a 'sequel' is in the pipeline. Laughing all the way to the bank.I give this movie 3/10 and that's for Lee evans, who at least gave it his best shot as the pizza boy.",Null,0,0,1 July 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Considering the budget...
","I was surprised this movie made about 11 million quid in Britain. I think it struggled for a while to even get a distributor and was in limbo.LS&2SB is the type of movie that a lot of people may feel obliged to like, on the basis that it has a few plot/twists and some 'cool' moments ala Pulp Fiction. For me it was a movie of two halfs, with the first half containing some truly appalling acting (I mean Dexter Fletcher is the guy who was the host of Games Master) and tiresome pacing. But the second half is a different story which manages to strike a balance between ludicrous and plausible plot twists. This movie could have been hard to follow but Guy Ritchie manages to pull it off. I just wish he had paid as much attention to detail in the first half of his script. Then again, the first half is all about set-up, it just could have been done better.When you take this movie for what it is - a gangster farce - then you'll probably enjoy it, but don't be put off by the acting at the beginning which does get better, and although the ending has been done before it still suits this kind of movie extremely well.6/10. Considering its budget, this movie made a lot of money.",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
The Untouchables," First class script, acting, and action.
","Written by David Mamet, its clear how the producers managed to attract a first rate cast. The story revolves around Elliot Ness' (Costner) pursuit of the seemingly unstoppable Chicago crime boss Al Capone (DeNiro), and is a superbly written tale, which is quite violent at times. One particular incident concerns DeNiro's baseball batting of a board member, which is pretty gruesome.Set in the 30's, it strangely never feels old-fashioned, probably due to the fact that Brian DePalma is at the helm, managing to bring a truly unique style to the proceedings. He also brings the best out of the cast, most notably Andy Garcia, in one of his better roles, and Sean Connery, who finally gets a long overdue Oscar for his portrayal of the doomed Irish Cop.The Untouchables is one of DePalma's greatest achievements, managing to deliver a movie that is perfectly executed on all levels, and never has a dull scene. I rarely enjoy these types of old-style gangster movies, but this is one of the few that truly deserves the title 'classic'.9/10.",Null,0,1,12 July 1999
Die Hard," The action movie that set the standard
","Action movies don't come much better than this, and Die Hard is one of the elite band of action movies that will stand the test of time, alongside classics like Terminator and Aliens.The producers may have had some doubt about casting the relatively unknown Willis (only really a TV star at the time), but Willis really shines and has the knack for making even the dumbest lines sound cool - 'Welcome to the party pal!'. It's a shame that the writer of this film ended up directing such abominations like Streetfighter.Alan Rickman deserves praise for what was his first major hollywood movie, managing to ham it up for all its worth. Unlike Willis, Rickman never managed to really make a Hollywood career,  his efforts really peaking with Robin Hood.Like all good action movies, the pace is spot-on, and the tension and one-liners never stop coming. Although the premise is extremely simple, it's in the predicament that we find the hero in and his own motivation to get out of the situation that we care about. I still rank this as Willis finest performance, and the movie never becomes boring on repeated viewings.It definitely ranks in my top 10 list of action movies, and will always be a film that is much imitated, but rarely bettered.9/10.",Null,0,0,9 July 1999

A film that is perfectly understandable to most people who speak english, but for some reason americans needed it re-dubbed. Huh? This movie has real dialogue, honest dialogue, none of that 'Dawson Creek' stuff.Does it glamorise heroin abuse? No, it shows the consequences of it.

Speed," As dumb as they come, but still quite fun
","Speed is a big dumb action movie that just happens to be an extremely riveting piece of entertainment. Being a 3-act movie (lift, bus, train), you feel like you're being taken round the block just one more time, but with the intensity of the first 2-acts, the train section can be forgiven, or even forgotten.This was one of those 'sleeper' films that crept out of nowhere to become one of 1994's biggest hits, and as action movies go, this is extremely well made eye candy. Heck, even I managed to forgive them for the stupid 'below 50 mph' premise, which many people found stretched the credibility of the film beyond the confines of 'dumbness'. However, any director who manages to make Keanu Reeves watchable deserves credit, because this is an art form all in itself.8/10.",Null,0,1,9 July 1999

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Rewatched...
","With Episode 1 opening in Britain on July 16th I decided to take a wander down memory lane. Now I wished I hadn't. Mark Hammill has to be one of the worst actors ever!. I squirmed every time he gave a line - he ruins the entire film. The only redeeming factor is Harrison Ford who knows he's making a kids movie and manages to save face. Hell, even Chewbacca puts in a good performance. Another irritating aspect of this movie is those damn droids - if Lucas was taking the mickey out of the audience then he succeeded. Enough said about them the better. Dialogue is another aspect that really highlights the problems with Star Wars - at times you think Lucas is really making strides then bam - another 'Power convertors' line pops up.I can remember as a young teenager thinking this movie was superb, but in order to enjoy the movie now would require accepting that mark hammill can act - something that can never really be done!5/10.",Null,0,0,5 July 1999
Braveheart," Uplifting, entertaining, and extremely well-made.
","In a mediocre year for the movies, this was one of the few highlights. A true epic, it tells the tale of William Wallace, one of Scotland's true heroic figures, in his battle for freedom from the English.Being a Hollywood production, it really plays fast and loose with actual historical events and many Scots probably find this an embarrassment, considering how important a figure Wallace really was. Gibson, while doing his best, never really convinces, and it's left to the supporting cast to provide the real character moments, most notably Angus McFayden as Rob the Bruce. The film contains some extremely well crafted battle scenes, and is quite violent throughout, and if you can forgive the historical inadequacies, it is a truly moving picture.This managed to win several Oscars, including the big two (director and best picture), and its clear why this was such a popular choice. Gibson weaves a truly exciting  tale of hatred and betrayal, bringing back the somewhat forgotten figure of William Wallace, one of Scotland's truly historic leaders. The cinematography and music are wonderful and while the mood is sometimes very dark, especially during the battles, (well, this was filmed during the winter months), Scotland (and Ireland) do look quite marvellous.Recently (June 99) this was re-released in a commemorative box-set in conjunction with the opening of Scotland's first parliament in 300 years and sold extremely well. It's obvious why, because Braveheart is a true epic, that if you can forgive the historically inaccurate plot, is one of the best movies of the 90's. A lot of people will feel a great sense of pride and hatred during this movie, but ultimately it manages to be entertaining, rather than a history lesson. If anything, this movie probably made a lot more Scots aware of Wallace, and many may have taken the effort to read up on the history to find the truth regarding this inspiring figure. Remember that this is a Hollywood movie, and should be treated as entertainment, not as a history lesson. Go to the library if you want the real truth.9/10.",Null,0,1,12 July 1999
The Breakfast Club," A forgotten gem of a teen movie
","This teen movie actually comes across more like a theatrical play, which is no bad thing. It is a purely dialogue driven film, and in the hands of a lesser writer, could have turned out to be utter drivel, but luckily it didn't and this is an intriguing character drama.The Breakfast Club is simply a comical study of the 5 different stereotypes that are present in most high schools, and while this doesn't call for any major plot, the setting of the library as the detention hall fits in perfectly. The writing is really out of the top drawer, and the young cast pull it off remarkably well, in particular Judd Nelson, who really should have carved a career for himself; he has a rare knack for knowing how to deliver one liners.At times the film does drag on a bit; the scene where Estevez gets high and dances about is pretty embarrassing, and the overlong 20 minute chat towards the end could have been trimmed down a bit. However, this is one of the few teen comedies that manages to hit the mark more often than it misses. Oh, and it contains that great song by Simple Minds as the perfect bookend: 'Don't you, forget about me ...'7/10.",Null,1,2,9 July 1999
Contact," First class drama
","Amidst your Armageddon's and Independence Day's it's reassuring that movies like this are still being made. Contact is an intelligent film, which surround the eventuality of first contact. The key to making this movie work is in letting the audience decide for themselves, rather than taking a definitive stance on the subject. For this, the writer and director should be applauded.On all levels this is an example of first-class film making, one which required a top notch cast to pull it all off. Luckily, Jodie Foster leads the way with another remarkably subtle performance as the seeker of truth. Able support comes in the form of Tom Skerrit, and James Woods who acts as the sceptic in us all.As a director, Zemecks is one of the best, having made some truly visual spectacles over the years (Back To The Future and Forrest Gump spring to mind), and with Contact he manages to keep you enthralled for two hours, using many dramatic camera tricks to enliven scenes that were bordering on being overlong. One of Contact's surprises is in its use of special effects, not the obvious ones, but those that go unnoticed by the majority of the audience. It really is amazing how much attention to detail is on show here. However, the movie isn't perfect, and one problem that can't be ignored is the character played by Jake Busey. The ultimate purpose of this guy should have been dealt with in a more believable manner.Nit-picking aside, Contact is one of the few movies made these days that not only makes you think, but places at the top of its priority list those oft neglected factors - dialogue and plot development. I just wish more movies were made with the obvious care and attention to detail that went into making Contact one of the best dramas of 1997.9/10.",Null,0,1,9 July 1999
Donnie Darko," Dull Donnie Dorko
","Donnie Darko is a film where nothing really happens and you wish you could travel back in time with the knowledge to avoid picking this excrutiatingly slow paced film at the video store. I had to apologise to my family for making them sit through it. It's the kind of movie that aspires to be something stranger and more intelligent than it actually is.
The plot? A guy has 'mental issues' and the concept of 'time travel' plays a role in his depressingly dull existence.",Null,0,1,18 April 2003
Jurassic Park," Still a land mark in film making
","It's hard to believe that it's 6 years since this film appeared at the cinemas. At the time it was a truly ground-breaking film, managing for the first time to portray dinosaurs in an extremely realistic manner, unlike those plasticine monsters that we were forced to watch in previous monster movies. Jurassic Park will also be remembered as the movie that finally made George Lucas sit up and realise that it was possible for him to make his prequels.In hindsight, while it is still an extremely well directed and tension filled movie, the script did seemed dumbed down in order to appeal to as many people as possible - but that's really irrelevant since this film is all about dinosaurs. One of Spielberg's brilliantly directed films, it even managed to make me forget Spielberg's previous disaster of a movie - do you recall HOOK?8/10.",Null,100,132,9 July 1999
