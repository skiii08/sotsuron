Casablanca," Casablanca (1942)
","After watching this romantic drama set during World War II, it is clear why it has been named one of the best movies of all time. First off, the acting is brilliant. There is a deep feeling of raw, pure emotion that basically the entire cast convey convincingly. Secondly, the cinematography is captivating. The dark lighting and heavy shadows add a dramatic feel, while the use of close-ups help focus the viewers attention and get a better understanding of the thought and feeling behind the story. My only problem with the film was that at times it seemed a bit hard to follow. If the situation hadn't been explained to me beforehand, I might have been completely lost. The good news, however, is that I can watch it again. Classic!",7,1,3,13 May 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
","The Grapes of Wrath is not exactly an edge-of-your-seat type film, but it is exceptionally realistic and does a fantastic job portraying the suffering that so many people and families experienced during the Great Depression. This film was a perfect example of great American film making because of its genuinity. It smoothly combined everything you need for a movie to be successful - breathtaking cinematography, spectacular writing and most importantly - brilliant directing. The characters performances were powerful and inspiring. The Grapes of Wrath is an unquestionably beautiful and spiring - yet educational - film at the same time. It is a story about hope; the point of the film isn't so much the plot as it is the setting and the horrible conditions that a typical family was pulled into. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone! Two thumbs up!",9,0,0,9 March 2011
Annie Hall," Annie Hall (1977)
","This romantic comedy was the first Woody Allen film I have ever seen. Right from the beginning it's as if you can sense a connection between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton that seems to go beyond acting. This film deals with the nature of relationships which is not only easy to relate to, but it is a topic that transcends time. Woody Allen uses a variety of techniques such as animation, flashbacks and subtitles to tell the story. The way he talks to the audience through the camera creates a real intimate connection with the movie and character like he is talking straight to you. Perhaps this is the reason why Annie Hall has received so much praise and remains many peoples' favorite Woody Allen film to this day.",9,0,0,13 May 2011
The Graduate," The Graduate (1967)
","I absolutely enjoyed this film. I found that it definitely took advantage of the 'New Hollywood' era where films were allowed to show things that were previously unacceptable due to the Hayes Code. I thought the acting was great - Ben played a lost and naive college graduate extremely well. The scene where Ben is in scuba diving gear and almost forced into the water by his parents is memorable and somewhat easy to relate to. It reinforces the fact that at that age we are so confused and unsure of our future, yet still rely on our parents for advice and guidance. The music is probably one of the most effective parts of the film especially for it's time. Simon and Garfunkel do an excellent job depicting the character's as well as the story's mood.",9,0,0,13 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain (1952)
","I truly enjoyed this film. It is a fun-filled love story musical showing Hollywood's transition from silent films to 'talkies' in a comical manner. In my opinion, Debbie Reynolds (Cathy) is not the best dancer. She is not as tight with her movements and doesn't flow as well as her partner. However, what makes this film so captivating IS the singing and dancing. It incorporates many various types of dance such as jazz, tap, ballet and even a bit of ballroom, swing and salsa. There was also a mini section of African dance. The dream-like scene switched from a classical ballet to more of a modern ballet. I thought that the 'Make Em' Smile' dance was wonderful and thoroughly entertaining. Two thumbs up!",9,0,1,13 May 2011
Psycho," Psycho (1960)
","Psycho is considered to be one of Alfred Hitchcock's most noteworthy pieces and for many obvious reasons. It is extremely intelligent, a psychological mystery thriller that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat never knowing just what will happen next. The infamous shower scene is shocking and terrifying - definitely one of the most epic murder scenes of all time. The cinematography is incredible. The black and white photography is effective because it adds to the overall creepy/uneasy/something-just-isn't-right feeling of the story overall. The music is simply genius as it underlies drama and increases suspense. Although this film may not have the same impact on audiences today, it is certainly a must-see for anyone who enjoys a classic psychological mystery thriller.",8,0,0,13 May 2011
