The Blair Witch Project," I really wanted to enjoy it!!!!
","Well, here we are in this woods (which doesn't seem to have a lot of trees; it looks more like a city park).  But we have wandered in far enough to get ourselves turned around. That's cool.  We are already spooked by the legends and our minds are playing games with us.  One of our problems is that we are all so self centered (nineties kinds of people) that we don't listen.  We whine, we complain, we don't think.  We film everything creatively but we also have a really stupid streak.  I thought the actors were very good. It's what they portrayed that bothered me.  Wouldn't it be good to have a look at what was going on outside the tent at night. It could have been a fringe group of the Girl Scouts.  Why was it categorically accepted that a fire should not be set.  If the witch is out there, then wouldn't you want to see it, or at least let it get itself singed.  Hey, you're in a tent. What could be more unprotected (we all know the stories about grizzley bears that treat small tents as doggy bags). Hey, maybe we could put someone at the door and let the others sleep!!! Why do we start running?  Where are we going?  There's nothing chasing us.  The power of suggestion takes over a little quickly here.  Why go into that house?  Why try to find that guy?  I mean, your first order of business is to find a way back. I felt for them and I thought the frantic camera work was interesting.  I just couldn't get past the stupidity of the people and their lack of survival instincts and self protectiveness. I agree that experimental cinema is wonderful and I'm glad that this has done well. Hollywood gets pretty tiresome.  But this movie didn't click with me.",6,0,4,24 January 2000
The King's Speech," Great View of a Lesser Known Period in England
","This is the wonderful story of the efforts by an unconventional speech teacher and a monarch. George VI grows up in a period where it mattered internationally what a king would say and how he said it. It was necessary for the people of Britain to have faith because they were in great need of substantiation, having to make a speech of great importance. Enter Lionel Logue, played by the inimitable Geoffrey Rush. He pulls himself from the sycophantic ineffectiveness of others and attacks the inabilities to deliver a speech by using unconventional, earthy methods to get the King to do his thing. I don't know if it happened that way. I'm hoping it did. But it's a great story. Colin Firth does a wonderful job as the British monarch and there are some nice minor performance, including Helena Bonham Carter as the King's better half. Beautifully directed and produced.",9,0,0,4 January 2015
Saturday Night Fever," Like It's From Another Planet
","This is a really unique film. Because it comes out of the disco era (which seems like a hundred years ago) some don't take it seriously. While I hated most of the music, I did like the Bee Gees and was intrigued by the knock down performance of John Trovolta. He is a man of arrogance and assuredness who dominates a subculture. A paint store worker by day, he lives for dancing, and he's darn good at it. He and his lackeys live a life of pain and violence. Women are at Tony's feet and he can do what he wants. What it is really about is a psyche that is so fragile. Those that admire Trovolta's character don't have the same ability to stand alone and some, one in particular, is on the brink. This is a slice of time that has past, but the quality of the film is excellent and will survive.",9,1,2,21 December 2016
Moneyball," Realistic View of the Front Office
","This film does a great job of introducing us to one of the most unconventional factors in the world of baseball. That is, the career of Billy Bean, who was the kind of general manager who had the gift of putting a team together based on normally overlooked talents. Along the way he and his financially gifted cohort (who really knows baseball) must face a hundred years of baseball tradition. They are cut off at every point by the manager who selfishly plays it safe, looking only after himself. The point is that a baseball season is longer than long and a great many nuances contribute to success. The strength of this movie is the realistic portrayal of the baseball world, particularly the relationships among the players and the front office. It also shows that a general manager, despite a position of importance, can still be seen as an insignificant person when things don't go well. It's truly, 'What have you done for me lately?' The interesting thing is that a mediocre ballplayer and unknown GM made changes that affected baseball forever.",9,0,1,24 May 2012
The Avengers," I'm Too Old for This!
","I'm swearing off super-hero movies. I've become abundantly aware that there are legions of fans out there who can't wait to see what Hollywood is doing with the classic comic book characters. But after three Iron Men and now this, I see a sameness in them all, and I'm not equipped properly to enjoy them as I should. I'm still rating this pretty high because it is amazing to look at, the special effects are beyond belief, and some of the characters have some dimension. That said, I think I would need a manual to really get the true impact of each character, what his or her powers are, and how they fit together. There is always some evildoing bad guy who has some history with the others. This is what makes comics what they are (I read lots of comics as a kid, so I do understand the milieu). When you get right down to it, however, they seem to rely mostly on beating each other over the head with whatever is handy. It's like watching professional wrestling which is sort of comic bookish in its own way. It's a cast of characters what represent simple things, both good and evil. I'll leave these to the kids and continue to watch movies with complex characters and clever story lines.",8,1,6,3 July 2013
Blade Runner 2049," Excellent, Intellectual Science Fiction
","This is an amazing piece of work. It has incredible artistry. As a visual exercise, it is breathtaking. I thought the original was way ahead of its time in creating a milieu, a dystopian world, full of disease and commercialism. Given the wonders of modern times, the world where this takes place is nonpareil. Ryan Gosling is out to eliminate the old replicants because there is a secret which needs to kept. The hierarchy is doing what it can to keep a world event from eliminating the awful world they have created. Goslin has memories, but they could have been implanted in him, so he is continually torn by dealing with details that may or may not be true. He needs to return to the place of his childhood. Harrison Ford reprises his original role of Deckard, now old and living in the ruins of Las Vegas. Evil is in control, but there is hope. The final scenes are incredible and puzzling, but it is a great challenge to the viewer.",10,147,337,6 October 2017
Million Dollar Arm," They Never Threw to a Batter n the Movie
","I thought this was a cute movie because of the young Indian men's precious responses to their new environment. I would be curious to see if beyond the baseball element, all the stuff took place. Did they stay with the guy? Did they get thrown out of the hotel? The actors are charming and lovable. Having been a baseball fan for 60 years, I can't believe that, as presented, these guys would be offered a contract. Unless it was to sell tickets or gain publicity. They can throw hard, but at no time do we see them with a batter in the batter's box or under game conditions. I would assume that if this is indeed a true story there would be more unseen than seen. I hate to be too critical, but I've always felt that a true sports movie must have credibility when it comes to the day to day requirements of the sport. There are also some really schmaltzy moments that are strictly to manipulate the audience.",7,0,0,10 August 2015
Angels & Demons," A Pretty Good Action Film
","As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, 'That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?' There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work. That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think. This is a marvel to look at and never stops for a second.",7,0,0,1 January 2010
First Man," Slides Away Quicky
","I just watched this on a plane. I was fairly impressed at first but as I've thought about it a good deal and I realize it's not a great movie. First of all, we are immediately made to believe that the death of Armstong's daughter has something to do with the space program. I agree, it shows a human side of him, but to make it central to his desires and ambitions is pretty simplistic. That is forgivable, but what is lacking is a taut story that really grabs us. This is the space race. Yes, I know that many Americans wanted the money to go elsewhere. At some point, however, all thos issues are tossed aside. This could have been really well done with some better writing. I also had some trouble with Gosling playing Neil Armstrong..",6,1,2,11 April 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," There Needs to Be a Better Transition from the Earlier Films
","I did see the previous movies and will be there to find out how it all plays out. Is it fair to criticize a film when one's memories of those first two films are a little fuzzy. I guess I am empathetic because the totalitarian government is so awful that I'm going to pull for these guys. Kateniss is the hero, but I'm not sure how she connects to the evils that are being perpetrated. Donald Sutherland's character is utterly rotten. But what is it he wants. I mean, is he getting any enjoyment out of his power other than to have it. I know history is dotted with megalomaniacs like this, but what will the world be. This part is filled with self- doubt and uncertainty. I fear that the power shift is like most (like the French Revolution) when evil trumps evil and we end up with evil. I've not read the books so I'm at a loss. There is so much unexplained stuff going on here that I hope gets explained in the future.",6,1,3,5 July 2015
Vertigo," Makes the Brain Spin
","Having experienced vertigo myself, the dizzying, confusing, frightening mind spinning, 'think you're going to die' kind of feeling, I can empathize with the Jimmie Stewart protagonist.  Make him a hero who has enough hangups from trauma to last a lifetime.  Put into the plot a series of misrepresentations of fact and you have this movie.  I think what I like the most is that we have this man trying to put his life together, but he doesn't know what to do to make it work.  He also is deep in depression, caused by personal loss. Along comes Kim Novak, the carbon copy of his lost love.  He falls into a sick reconstruction of his past life, but the fear is still there and won't go away until he is able to confront his ghosts.  Once again, the Hitchcock hero fumbles his way along, trying to discover while being pursued.  There is that threat there all the time.  The cinematography is excellent.  The method used to show the feeling he gets when he looks down, is pure genius. The framing of scenes. The stairway in the tower. The scenes by the bay. Novak's 'coming out' is really spooky, so captivating and yet unsettling. The true test of a movie, for me, is always going to be that there is something to see after several viewings.  Hitchcock's films, especially the really good ones, allow me a lifetime of rediscovery; I feel that directors like Hitchcock are a gift to humanity.  This film is one of the reasons I feel this way.",10,3,7,5 May 1999
Black Swan," Painful to Watch
","This is one of those films best seen only once. It hones in on the fragility of an artist and lays open wounds that are hard to witness. Natalie Portman's character is driven but vulnerable and s set up to succumb to her art. Of course, rivalry is a given, and her rival does everything she can to put the screws to her. Unfortunately, the questioning of her own talent is going to show at some point. I can't say I enjoyed this movie. I realize that obsession is often a strength with artists, but it can also be all consuming. This film is about as dark as it can be but it puts a stranglehold on the viewers.",9,3,4,5 May 2019
Changeling," The Bad Guys Are So Bad!
","This film certainly moved me. Angelina Jolie's performance is subtle and painful. This is a well acted drama. Apparently, this is based on true events. I am looking forward to doing a little research on the Los Angeles police department at some future time. Were they really this bad. The whole thing smacks pretty true these days in that power corrupts and the press are often irresponsible. The fact that anyone would buy that a mother wouldn't recognize her own son should be ludicrous. Yet, they wanted a good story and she became duped by them. What follows is a series of events that are so hideous and so sad that they energize the story. One drawback is that at some point the whole issue of suspense sort of dribbles away and when the film is over, there is a bit of a letdown. As full of conflict as the movie was, it could have used just a little more. Still, it is a very interesting movie with very fine performances.",8,2,5,9 October 2009
Scarface," One Man Show
",So many have already commented on this movie that I don't have much to add. I just want to say that this violent black comedy has one of the most memorable characters in all of movies. It's also one of the most quotable films of all time. As the immigrant Tony makes his way to the top by dropping people in huge quantities and manipulating a system that plays into his hands. He is a juggernaut and why he rises as he does when he is often clueless is quite amazing...and we buy it. Pacino takes his Corleone character to the Nth degree by pretty much taking the humanity out of him. We love him; we hate him; but we certainly can't ignore one of the most off-the-wall performances of all time.,8,0,2,3 January 2015
Love and Death," The Master's Eye
","I thank the world for Woody Allen. Whatever his weirdness and personal problems, he is one of those people who sees the insanity, the beauty, and the possibilities of everything we are. He is the humble commentator who can take the familiar and push it to the nth degree and do it with style. 'Love and Death' was part of his heyday. He takes on the entire history of Russia, Dostoevsky, Pasternak, Eisenstein, and Tolstoy, and plays with every nuance that is available. Boris is the same cowardly creature that bumbles his way through all of life, but like Groucho Marx, he always knows when he comes upon the moment.I would just like to talk about some of my favorite scenes, and these are far from complete:When they drop the village idiot, whom they have adopted, at the Village Idiot's Convention. There are a huge group of similar figures, dancing around, their fingers in their mouths.The eating of snow to survive the Zhivago winter.The little piece of land.The long philosophical discussion that ends in their saying that all they ever talk about is sex.The meeting with the countess, the destroyed room from a blistering sexual encounter. Yet, five minutes have passed on the clock.Sonja's willingness to marry Boris only if he can assure her that he will be killed the next day.The slapstick attempt to kill the Emperor.The visual quotations from all the great Russian films; especially reversing the positions of the lion statues from standing to sitting; the opposite of Eisenstein in Potemkin.I could go on, but I just need to say that this is one of those films that grow more wonderful, the more you know. Woody Allen did this when he was less filled with angst and more of an observer of what culture has blessed us with. No one could parody like Woody Allen and this is a masterpiece.",9,1,1,19 May 1999
Frost_Nixon," Respectfully Submitted
","If one is expecting to see a surly one dimensional Nixon and Frost as a pure white knight, it doesn't happen in this film. Someone here really looked into character and created a set of complex events and complex people. One doesn't become President of the United States without being a pretty charismatic figure. Nixon goes down in history as a crook, but he was a lot more than that. Frank Langella reprises his theater role and plays Nixon to the hilt. He is manipulative, calculating, somewhat charming in the correct circumstances, and nearly obsessed with 'correcting' his image. The byplay that takes place between Nixon and Frost is priceless. I've been told that even if you don't like the President, the power emanating from the office itself, makes one weak kneed. There is a really precious scene that illustrates this, though I don't want to spoil it. David Frost comes off initially as a bit shallow. If we are to believe the events, we see him really in over his head. I had no idea that he had made such a financial commitment to these interviews. It is also interesting to see the dynamics among himself and his colleagues. This is an 'acting' move and well worth the time. If you lived through Watergate, you will especially treasure this.",8,1,2,25 August 2009
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," In Name Only
","I suppose I'll sound like a broken record. I enjoyed this movie, but, like the first, I almost never think of it as a Sherlock Holmes film. If Indiana Jones were to be transferred into Robert Downey's body, it wouldn't make any difference. Because of the name recognition, many entities are capitalizing on the Holmes name. Making him a quirky indecipherable enigma, or making his partner a woman named Watson who is of Asian descent. These are certainly interesting but so far removed from the Holmes mythos that it does nothing for me. This is a wild adventure with lots of twists and turns, leading to some really dramatic moments; but it's also so full of contrivances that I have to suspend so much disbelief. People just know things without the ratiocination that was the whole of the original character. We could use a dose of that in any new Holmes incarnation which would really substantiate the character.",8,0,0,17 July 2012
Gremlins," Never Get Him Wet
","This movie really struck a nerve with my son. He watched it numerous times and did impressions of little Gizmo for years. This is really a sendoff of all kinds of horror movies, but with a real sense of humor. The little guy is so darned cute. He is cuddly and actually kind of pretty. Of course, we know from the beginning that things will go haywire. What is neat about this film is that what happens is so darned much fun. Gizmo's offspring are pure evil. They relish every kind of anti-social behavior. They are like a bunch of drunk teenagers who have lost any sense of order, willing to provide hurt to anyone who gets in their way. They have the appearance of bats or mosquitoes or some sort of hybrid. They are Gizmo gone bad. There are lot of pretty good character actors in this film who find themselves bewildered by what happens. I was surprised to see a country singer, Hoyt Axton, playing the father. I just remember a song called 'Bony Fingers.' This works delightfully, but not until incredible mayhem is launched.",8,2,3,1 December 2016
The Monuments Men," A Hollywood Retelling
","I think people need to relax a bit and take a deep breath. This movie is pure Hollywood. It took an event near the end of World War II and put their own spin on it. To say it's the worst war movie ever made is really cynical and mean spirited. Granted, the characters are pretty stiff and not very well developed. They reminded me of those 1940's caricatures from propaganda driven films. Still, the event it is based on is a unique one in the annals of war history. Actually, in a convoluted way, the Nazi's interest in art probably was indirectly responsible for saving it. It prevented them from launching full-blown artillery attacks on some of the world's great museums. Instead, they stole these masterpieces (another means of repressing humanity) and stored them in salt mines and other secret places. The effort to discover and recover these masterpieces is what this is all about. Of course, in reality, this was done by about 150 people, not the seven presented here. Unexplained to the audience is how after a discovery a battalion of military vehicles seems to show up immediately to secure the art. There is also the sacrifice that is pretty contrived and gratuitous. This is a sort of old-fashioned movie done in contemporary times. Go along for the ride and don't imagine you are seeing Shakespeare.",7,1,2,18 March 2014
Antz," King of the Hill
","The first strength of this film is that it features Woody Allen in the principle role. The ant he plays delivers the self absorbed and fearful lines that Woody delivers in each of the films he is in. Here he plays an ant who is part of the collective. He realizes his only significance is a cog in the the machine that, for all practical purposes, reproduces itself but never evolves. He meets a female ant and the two have similar issues. There are all the expected pitfalls, and they make their respective ways toward a kind of utopia for crawly things. This is really quite delightful. I believe it came out close to the time 'A Bug's Life' did.",8,1,2,8 March 2017
Miracle," Exploitative and Fun
","Despite the fact that this movie is made to manipulate us, it's so darn much fun, it doesn't matter. You have a true story with great action scenes, wonderful hockey footage. You have the bad guy Russians and their powerhouse team, you have a group of really attractive American young men, and, finally, best of all, Kurt Russell's wonderful portrayal of the frenetic Herb Brooks. Being a Minnesotan, Mr. Brooks is a real hero around here, dying tragically in a car accident a few years ago. He molded this team and made them more than they should have been. There is a nice interaction among the characters. It's not simply a coach with total insensitivity and a bunch of young men who are going to 'show him.' He has great affection, but he knows that dreams take hard work, and so he pushes them mercilessly. There is the chess match of picking the right players and personalities and then messing with their minds. He even brings in a former U of M player to make them a little nervous. It helps create the team because this guy hadn't been part of the family. Anyway, the movie is a joy to watch, even though we know the ending. We can use a boost by something like this every so often.",9,1,1,30 November 2006
10 Cloverfield Lane," Will They Seek Out Other Cloverfields?
","I love John Goodman. I just watched Trumbo and thought his character piece was delightful. He can play those wacky, threatening, but endearing characters. Here, he is an unbalanced villain whose villainy trumps the real threat (whatever that is). I saw Cloverfield a few weeks ago and it certainly filled in some pieces, but whether you have seen it or not, it is worth the effort to watch Goodman explain to his two captives why they are so lucky to have this nut case looking after them. He has built a bunker, and an unfortunate young man and woman, who are clueless as to why they are there, become his 'children' (sort of). Since they see early on that this guy is crazy, they realize they had better try to escape. Like the deranged father he is, he 'punishes' them when they disobey. What is not stated until the end is what's out there. That's why we hang in there for a couple hours. I dropped my rating because of some pretty contrived stuff at the end (hokey, if you must know), but the acting is very good, and the movie delivers 90 percent of the time. That's pretty good these days.",7,1,2,30 June 2016
The Sound of Music," Great Songs but Just a Little Sappy
","This was probably 'the' first blockbuster of my movie viewing period. I remember at the Academy Theater in downtown Minneapolis, it was the only movie that showed for over a year. People would come back to the small town I lived in and rave about. Because I was a kid with little money and no chance to tool around the big city, I didn't get to see it until it finished its initial run and made it out into the hinterlands. It was breathtaking on wide screen. That opening scene is really impressive. Everybody knows every song. Julie Andrews has always defined perkiness and energy and she carries it off magnificently. There is something missing somewhere. Despite all the great songs, the threat that was Naziism never quite comes through. They are there and they are the worst of the worst, but we never quite feel their power. Even the scene at the Abbey is a little hokey. Watching 'Cabaret' which is certainly a totally different take, you see what these monsters could be. It is a musical with a little more depth, though not as mainstream. Still, how can you pass on the wonderful songs, the awesome production numbers, the visions of Austria, parading before us. It's a really good movie. I never quite got to the 'great' part.",8,5,15,9 March 2006
Skyfall," These Films Could Use Some Tightening Up!
","I began watching Bond films with 'Dr. No.' I have been thrilled, disappointed, exhilarated, bored, and challenged. The best Bond movies are the ones that have a cohesion, despite the action sequences. There were times when I wondered if the producers packaged these by the pound. How many ridiculous chase scenes can you cram into a space. That's OK sometimes because these films have a sense of humor and an in-your-face craziness that is a hallmark. However, it's the space that may be a problem. The later films are just too long. When a confrontation takes twenty minutes to resolve, you need a program to try to remember the big picture. This one suffers from the same affliction. While things do eventually resolve themselves, we are led all over the place where distraction is the result. I must say that I stayed pretty interest throughout, but at times I began to look at my watch, wanting to cut to the chase. I like Daniel Craig. He seems to be a more complex Bond than some of the others, but the screenplays need editing and the action sequences more under control.",6,0,3,7 January 2014
Catch Me If You Can," Like Father, Like son
","This is a very good dramatic film. Frank W. Abignale is a successful con man. Sometimes he uses his skills by design; sometimes he uses it to get away from threats to his identity. This is a young man who is so traumatized by his parents' divorce, but because his father knew how to con people, he learned to do what his father did. He is not a mere con man, but a young guy with incredible skills. He passes himself off as a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher, and on and on. Leonardo DeCaprio plays Abignale and Tom Hanks is the rather humorless FBI agent who makes Frank his number one project. The interaction is interesting because the two begin to like each other. Abignale actually starts to find a father figure in Hanks' character. This is based on a real character, the object of an autobiography.",9,1,2,8 January 2017
The Hangover," The Curse of Cable
","If it weren't for their incredible series, premium channels would have gone the way of the dinosaurs. Their movie offerings are so hit and miss, and they keep reshowing the same things. I had heard enough about this film and I had some bills to pay. So I sat down and survived it. I'm too old, I guess. I know this is so outrageous that one shouldn't take it seriously. I often comment on people's reactions to things that aren't anything but entertaining. This film is just not very engaging. It's a bit too much to think that a group of men could all get so drunk that they can't remember anything. For one to have that issue is stretching it. For all of them. Well! I do admit that given some of the visual stuff, I did laugh. I mean, there's a tiger in one of the rooms. There's a chicken running around. But at some point, it is so over the top, and the issues so irreconcilable, I had to think that only ridiculous plotting could get them out of this. And, of course, it did. Sometimes, I'm amazed at how movies gravitate toward the lowest common denominator and this one does as well. But I will pass on being too harsh. There are people who think Macdonalds makes the best food there is and there are people who have this taste in movies. To each 'his' own.",4,2,3,9 January 2017
Ghost," Worth Watching Just to Watch Whoopie!
","With an opportunity to see the Broadway production of the musical, I thought it would be good to revisit the original with my family. I saw this in a movie theater on its first run and came away with some mixed feelings. I guess if you accept the premise that one can be caught in a kind of purgatory, stuck between heaven and hell, then you can also accept that there are demons that come up from hell and pull the bad guys down. I thought that a less clichéd view of the spiritual cosmos and not a hackneyed Dante-esque one would have been more effective, but then I have no belief in fire pits and angels playing harps. The story itself is quite fun with Patrick Swayze killed so that his trusted colleague can embezzle money, using accounts Swayze has access to. Swayze lives with Demi Moore (who is a knockout) and they have had trouble committing. Once dead, he is able to move about and observe all that is happening. He also becomes part of a fraternity of dead people stuck in the same place (apparently, they haven't settled their scores). As he watches he realizes that his lover is in danger from his murderer and his 'friend.' Swayze engages a medium, played by Whoopie Goldberg in an Academy Award performance, to try to connect with Demi. She can hear him, but can't see him. It takes time for him to break down the barriers of distrust and apprehension (what would we do?). He learns from one of the other dead guys how to make things move through mental effort, and he uses this to his advantage. Of course, one has to mention the famous scene with the sculpting of the gigantic phallic symbol while the Righteous Brothers sing 'Unchained Melody.' The other memorable scene is the one where Whoopie is in the bank and Swayze is telling her what to say as she withdraws four million dollars from an account. It's certainly worth a look if you've not seen it.",8,1,3,23 June 2014
Iron Man 3," Wow! Was It Really That Bad?
","My goodness. I've just read a series of reviews of this film. I had no idea it was so bad. I guess I'll have to un-enjoy it. Is that a word? I'm just an old guy who likes to go to movies. While I read comic books as a child, I never really let them dictate my very existence. My pain has been watching the Minnesota Vikings for 50 years and having them never win a Super Bowl. The angst over this movie is nearly startling. To make the fact that the studio took liberties with the characters may be disappointing, but the sun will come up tomorrow. I taught literature for over 40 years and I never saw a movie that aligned well with a book. Granted, some movies were actually improvements. Most of the time they were not. Since I didn't know Manderin, I didn't go in thinking he was Iron Man's sworn enemy. The rules were changed and the villains altered. I thought it was a very exciting movie. It had all the cliffhanging events required of an adventure. Special effects allow us a range of spectacle we could not have imagined. Downey and his smug, aloof being are quite delightful. And I felt for the most part that things went as they should. I have seen the other two movies and thought they were also fun. Unlike the fanboys, I don't have the energy to figure out the rule being followed by the players. I need to know how to defeat this guy who has evolved to a horrible force. That is, if you hit him with an i-beam 600 times, which one kills him, or do they kill him? We aren't told. Or are we? Part of any plot or quest is that the hero must face his own shortcomings and rise to the task and (now get this) with knowledge of what it takes, defeat evil. Much like the mercury man in Terminator 3, I was not sure exactly what needed doing; do we melt him, crush him, dismember him, throw him in a pit of molten metal. I don't know. Kind of left me a little cold.",7,2,5,17 June 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Only to Praise It
","I used to run home after school to see those awful (technically) Flash Gordon episodes that were hosted by some guy from the television station who made an extra 25 bucks a week to pretend that these were real.  It was exciting.  It was gripping.  But mostly, it wasn't that good.  'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is what those serials would have been with a great story and the money to do what needed to be done.  I know so much has been said.  My two cents' worth is.  A great character, one with incredible determination but human failings, a wonderful female sidekick with whom he has a history. A series of magnificent 'hopeless' situations.  Nazis.  A mystical object from the Bible.  Pacing that is exquisite.  One narrow scrape after another. Broken ribs.  Carrying on with broken ribs.  Just enough of the supernatural to make for a good conclusion (although, how do the heroes know that you're not supposed to look at things), though the majority of the film is about real people in the most insane maze of events.  I saw this in the theater the second day it was out.  It hadn't had the hoopla that the Star Wars movies had had.  I came out of it feeling so excited that someone in the movie industry could spin such a tail and conclude it in the most satisfying way.  I would love it if when adventure movies were made, that someone could keep a sense of humor once in a while and let these fine actors put life into wonderful characters.",9,1,2,5 November 2001
Deja Vu," It Really Got Me
","I've seen and read so many time travel things over the years that I know one could pick at this forever. Still, once we embrace the technology and go with the plot, it's hard to stop watching. This evaded me when it first came out. I rented it and was captured. First of all, it's that cool Denzel thing he does. Especially when he is quizzing someone. He knows he's the man and he leaves the person being spoken to looking to see if his wallet has been stolen. I remember some of this from 'Remember the Titans.' The passing in and out of realities begs the question of what will happen to the characters when they make it back? Especially if we like them. And we do. The government, of course, does what it can to screw up, but the rebel always get his way, doesn't he? This is a film one thinks about long after seeing it. I decided to ignore the science and just enjoy it. I would have given it 9 but there are some plodding parts in the middle. It also suffers from a bit too much avoidance of common sense.",8,1,2,28 March 2008
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," It's a Masterpiece
","There are those times when all the forces at work come together and you have a masterpiece. This, of course, is a kids' movie. Obviously, it is so much more. It is a story of love and heart and character. To begin with, as a middle school teacher, I can attest to the wonderful casting and writing. It doesn't insult us. It shows us how a person who knows the heart of humanity (and that extends to the alien nation) can transcend cliché and put forth a beautiful story--but not a lightweight one by any means. The adults make up the periphery. The childlike quality of the lovable alien could only be appreciated and cared for by those who have not become as jaded as they. As soon as those adult figures show up, everyone is in trouble. Yet, for the most part, they have good intentions. The government agents are another issue. They bring force and death.Who hasn't seen this. There are series of episodes that have become part of our cultural landscape. Words have been brought into our language. We speak along with Elliot and ET. Halloween, phoning home, frogs all over the lab, hiding in the closet among the stuffed animals, the bike ride where the bikes suddenly leave the ground, the touching of the finger and the heart. It's just magical. Sometimes when one sees a movie, one begins to say, 'If only they had done this or that.' I can't think of anything in this film. Why write this review. Just to include my two cents' worth.",10,70,103,2 March 2006
Casablanca," One of our most quotable movies
","Not only have countless responders talked about this film; geniuses of the film criticism have picked it apart. Like so many of my most highly rated films, it's all about character. Someone said that modern film audiences don't see it as a classic. I love all kinds of movies. I am disappointed much more with contemporary films than older ones because filmmakers were forced to us a lot more imagination. Granted, there are many bad films in every era as well as great ones. When I see every reviewer start with an evaluation of special effects. Why is it that so many films need to rely on special effects. This movie is a romance of the highest order. It asks so much of its stars. The incredible lighting that accentuates the faces of the characters makes it all work. Then you have real stars in Bogie and Bergmann. Todays actors are so bland and interchangeable for the most part. There was a reason for a star system. Even today, I want to see the less glamorous actors: Hackman, Eastwood, etc. When Bergmann is on the screen, there is no one who can show the passion and pain that she does. Also, consider the vignettes concerning war embattled Casablanca. There is a force at work to destroy all that is good and right. The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing 'The World Belongs to Me.' See this if you never have.",10,1,3,9 March 2006
One Hundred and One Dalmatians," It Isn't One of the Best but Better Than Most
","Still sitting amidst the height of Disney's animation, this film about a puppy mill to make fur coats for an evil woman is quite startling. Cruella DeVille is the villain (I used to joke about her saying how could she have lived anything but an evil life with a name like that). She of the chiseled cheeks and cigarette holder, with that cackle. What we have is an effort by the good guys to overcome the machinations of the bad guys to rescue all those dogs. The story's strength is in outwitting fools. It's always been interesting how bad people in film hire some of the biggest idiots on the planet to work for them. This is the case once again as those two bozos hatch their plans. Since events are entirely predictable, we need only look to the excellence of the animation and the soundtrack to really enjoy this film.",8,2,3,8 December 2016
Minority Report," Reasonably Good Sci Fi
","A great deal must have been spent on this film. I was hesitant at first. For one thing, the whole issue of prior restraint, that 1984 sort of thought police thing. It's also dependent on a unique group of young people who are being exploited for their visions. When they realize that a murder is going to be committed, they produce a little ball with the name of the perpetrator on it. This is a bit odd. It seems they could have come up with a little different way of presenting this. If one thinks too much, this all falls apart, but if we are going to enjoy, we need to dive in and accept this. It moves along at a nice pace and provides reasonable satisfaction at the conclusion.",8,1,2,11 June 2010
Finding Neverland," A Movie About How We Love
","Let's start with the idea that there are numerous biographies of J. M. Barrie, as there are of many other famous writers. Barrie is pretty much known for 'Peter Pan' and little else. If asked about his personal life, could any of you come up with anything about him. So what happens here is a fictional account of the writer, making him a bit of an irresponsible boy (a lost boy?). While bouncing around with his writing and failing here and there, he one day come upon a widow and her four boys. Because children are so much to him, he begins to get to know the boys. His interactions help them (with one exception) diminish their sorrow over the death of their father. He also begins to befriend the young widow. The whole story is touching. I won't do anything to spoil the ending. Just to say that it is touching. It's a movie about love and sacrifice and it's beautifully done.",9,0,0,11 January 2017
Lifeboat," Claustrophobic Epic
","There aren't many directors who would dare to take on a script like this. How do you manage to keep an audience interested for an hour and a half when all your characters are stuck on a small life boat, floating in the open sea, after a U-boat attack. The strength comes from a group of figures, each with his or her own agendas and secrets. There is also the fact that it is wartime. Danger lurks in the sea. Things get interesting when a German is brought on board. He has been treading water. What are the moral issues here? What point was Hitchcock trying to make? As each story unfolds, we are taken into the minds and motives of the boat members. See what happens. One of the most unique movies ever made.",9,0,0,18 December 2016
John Wick," Best Dance Movie I've Seen in Some Time
","Since the plot is so lacking in substance (the old, you killed my wife and my dog bit), we must look to other things to find positive. First of all, Keanu Reeves is pretty good on screen, and plays an interesting avenger. The bad guys seem to have an endless supply of stupid employees who allow their heads to be blown off. Sounds stupid? But the directing and movement of the characters during the incredibly long scenes of destruction are quite amazing. It's sort of a Kill Bill thing. Anyway, it is engaging. I did like that cast. The kid that was in Game of Thrones (who was eviscerated in that show) was a nice foil for Wick. We also have the fellow who is Mayhem in the insurance commercials. Of course, there are enough loose ends for the sequels (which number two at this point). I probably won't bother if they just have more of the same. Put an actual plot in there and you would have a bit of balance.",7,0,0,16 November 2019
Chinatown," Forget It Jake, It's Chinatown
","This is a top ten for me. I have watched this film several times, and each time I see why Jack Nicholson is one of our great American actors. It starts with a story of complexity but accessibility. Nicholson's Jake Gittes, running around with a slit in the side of his nose, put there by Polanski, investigates, gets careless, and realizes what he has stumbled upon. Fay Dunaway as Mrs. Mulray and John Huston and that voice: 'Just find the girl.' There are comic scenes and Nicholson has feet of clay, but he finally puts his personal integrity on the line. He moves into darkness and sees the underside. And then there is Chinatown with its secrets, politics, incest, all of that. It is such an intelligent movies. One of the reviewers said it was compact. That says it all. Every scene is necessary. It's too bad Polanski can't work in the U.S. anymore--he still releases a treasures every so often. To get back to the movie, all that leads to the climactic last several minutes has been prepared for with loving care by the director. It's so nice to know that there are films like this that people will watch into the latter stages of the 21st century. One of finest.",10,1,3,20 March 2006
A Star Is Born," I Enjoyed It
","I know some will say this is a manipulative film. Perhaps, to some extent. When Lady Gaga began performing, I couldn't stand her. My old fogieness caused me to find her pretentious and doing anything for attention. Over the last couple years I have grown to really enjoy what she does. At an advanced age, I would love to see her in concert. Being able to here her great range and depth in this movie was a very pleasant experience. Also, the chops of Bradley Cooper were quite amazing. We all know the plot. I've seen all but one of the previous incarnations, so the big picture stuff was no an issue. There were a few slow moments but I think it worked very well.",8,2,2,20 July 2019
Gravity," Well Crafted, but Really Hard to Believe
","First of all, special effects are first rate, acting pretty good, and decent suspense. It's a likable movie that deals in scientific realities and events that 'could' happen. Like so many films that are of this genre, we have to look at the likelihood of a single person being able to accomplish what she does. Just the punishment she takes would be enough to squash most mortals. She is smashed against bulkheads, caught in webs of detritus, oxygen starved, burned and frozen, but never into submission. I guess I can't criticize her surviving since in the story she does. There is also her ability to adapt to a setting (a Russian space ship) where she seems to know an awful lot. Granted, she is an astronaut, but her ability to adapt is beyond the pale. All that said, it's a thrill-a-minute science fiction thriller with two charismatic actors (a bit of the supernatural as well). I left exhausted and somewhat satisfied, but when I thought about the whole of it, I realized it wasn't a great movie.",7,0,1,3 January 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," A Comment on Our Gullibility
","This is such a fine movie. It involves a guy who was born just down the street in Bethlehem. The Magi go to him first and then realize they are confused and leave. He tries to lead a normal life, but word gets out that he is the Messiah. He does everything he can to get this off his back, but a group of followers begin interpreting his words as great wisdom and godliness. It gets so bad that when they are sent to check out 'the other Guy' they ultimately find his pronouncement (actually non-pronouncements) to be much more impressive. There is a hilarious scene where he tries to make a statement about the Romans, but his Latin is so bad he is force to write it over and over on the walls, like an American schoolboy. The final scene is incredible. If you've never heard the song or seen the images, check it out. I would imaging there are some people who find this movie blasphemous. I consider it one of the greatest parodies ever produced.",10,9,14,21 December 2016
Erin Brockovich," A Complex Character, To Say the Least
","Julia Roberts is not my favorite actress. She has hung on to a star that was sort of thrust on her from a movie that is not all that great, 'Pretty Woman.' This, supposedly, established an edginess for her, though her character had literally no connection to a true prostitute. With all that said, I think she did fine in this film. I know that some have said that this has all been done before. So crusading for people victimized by humorless industrial entities has been done before. The strength, however, is in the specifics. Brokavich, a real person, found herself in the midst of a nasty situation. She makes a discovery that sets in motion a huge lawsuit where she is put to the test.",8,1,1,11 January 2017
Mulan," A Very Good Character
","I took my kids to this film when it was first released. I had not seen it since. My daughter holds it in high regard. It is quite a nice film. Mulan, the title character, is being groomed to marry, following the various requirements of one in her position. I would be interested to see how Chinese people today would accept or reject her as a character. The empire is being invaded by the Huns and one member of each family must go fight. Since she is an only child, her frail father must again put on his military uniform and go to fight. He can barely walk and it is horrible for Mulan to watch. She cuts her hair, dons the military clothing, and sets out to join the fray. She is accompanied by a dragon that the spirits have given her out of fear for her safety. Unfortunately, he is relatively useless. Played by Eddie Murphy, he is pretty much the same character as Donkey from Shrek. His mouth flaps constantly with no filter. Once she enters the service, she must maintain her boy-ness and perform deeds that make her useful to them. Her successes are often accidental, but she begins to be seen as a force to her fellow warriors. The Huns are enormous and dangerous, and she must eventually face off the with their leader, no easy task. This is all about having no standing in a culture of sexism that has been around for centuries. This would be quite inspiring for young girls.",8,1,1,24 June 2015
Se7en," Almost Too Much to Bear
","I was totally taken with this film. It's not The Usual Suspects, but it is really something. Unfortunately, I felt almost sick when I was finished watching it. The madness of the murders and the general philosophical sickness that carries it along put it out of reach for some of us. I can't imagine the world portrayed here. Great cast. I really thing Brad Pitt is excellent; and, of course, Morgan Freeman is his usual complex self. Once again, however, in a relatively brief appearance, Kevin Spacey steals every scene he's in. It's that unflappable delivery of his. No matter what is said or done, he anticipates it. The murders are hideous. The camera doesn't show the most gory details (which I appreciated), but they are sold to us through outside factors. I missed this the first time through and wanted it to be part of my movie-going experience. I don't think I could ever watch it again.",8,4,6,9 March 2010
Wayne's World," Here's What I Think
","I never saw the bit that led to this movie. It's my belief that a movie should work for someone, even if they are not familiar with the source material. For instance, we shouldn't have to read 'Pride and Prejudice' to enjoy a film based on it. I do like Mike Myers and Dana Carvey. The use of local cable was an opportunity for those with some creative energy to get time to put their ideas out there. Now it's You Tube or streaming. There are several bits in this movie that are hilarious in and by themselves. But without a true center and a 'script' it is just a compilation. There is no real story here. I know that some of the previous reviewers call those that don't like this 'snobby.' I believe what they are saying is that they don't like anyone really seeing what's there and putting an intelligent set of criteria on it. This is a silly movie and very funny in places. That's all it is.",6,1,1,30 December 2016
The Big Lebowski," Goodman and Bridges, Oh My!
","This is one of those movies I never got around to seeing. It is one of the most delightful black comedies of all time. Watching the byplay between the frenetic John Goodman and Jeff Bridges is priceless. The plot is all over the place and we are played once in a while, but the excitement is in the journey, not the end. Bridges' character is the laid back, sixties protest type who is accosted one day (a case of mistaken identity) as a couple of thugs beat him and one pees on his rug. This sets in motion and effort to find the man who shares his name and get his rug replaced (he ultimately steals one of the man's rugs). This sets off John Goodman (a poster child for anger management). They become involved in a kidnapping drop and I can't begin to explain the rest. Suffice it to say, these guys have a great chemistry and all Bridges can do is watch the dominoes fall. Goodman has made a career of playing lovable psychos for the Coen Brothers. This may be his masterpiece.",9,1,6,1 September 2010
Star Trek," It Was Time for Retooling (Retelling)
","I got a great deal of enjoyment from this film. As one who watched the original in a dormitory TV room every Friday night, I have always embraced this canon, though I've never reached the lunatic fringe. Now that the original crew is either old, fat, or dead, I see nothing wrong with taking the characters and recasting them. If Basil Rathbone had been the only Holmes, we would never have had Jeremy Brett. I hope this sets up a future because there was nowhere to go with the originals (this is a fact of life called aging). The scenes of the founding of the relationships among the characters is nicely done. Those that criticize the look of the ship need to look what has happened here on earth in the last twenty years. Why should the bridge not change to become more true to the future as we can view it now? I thought the new characters found their individual ways. We forget that Kirk was always a bit of a loose cannon and we get to see why. Starship captains needed to have controlled recklessness to boldly go, as they say. The plot is up to the plots of the early series and all the bells and whistles complement this. The strength is the new characters. About fifteen minutes into the film I forgot that they weren't Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner. I just started enjoying the film.",9,1,6,26 August 2009
Fight Club," It's Hard to Take Your Eyes Away
","I'm not much into graphic violence. This film transcends that. It has wonderful direction, and, even though it is brutal, it takes things to another ledge. Edward Norton is really controlled as he realizes his power. It's too easy to throw in spoilers so I will leave things to the viewer. The search for self and the growing cult around Fight Club made me suspicious. Still, to watch what happens to the two men at the center and what they are without Fight Club is the core. One of the neat things about this film is seeing it a second town makes it even better. The mental byplay between Pitt and Norton increases tension to explosiveness. If you want to see what can happen to a story when put in masterful hands, read the book (which is outstanding), and see the movie. They show that art forms can treat the same material, each in their own ways.",9,1,5,3 January 2007
Citizen Kane," Welle's pushed every button
","Many say this is the greatest film of all time. I don't know. It's such a personal comment that I don't believe even a modest consensus can be reached. That said, there is no disputing that this is one of the most influential projects ever done. Having read some books about Orson Welles, I still don't understand, other than having as strong a personality as is possible, how he had the film knowledge and vision that went into this masterpiece, on his first try. There are hundreds of stunning shots. The camera and what it does is enough to carry the film. The editing take us from place to place in a heartbeat. the characters are pithy and interesting, especially Kane. Then there's the William Randolph Hearst thing that is going on in the background. We see power; we see power corrupting. We see love of self contrasted with love of others. We see the oppressive cloud of loneliness descend upon the powerful. Wealth versus happiness. Which is, of course, the overriding theme. If anyone doubts the effectiveness of black and white cinematography, just watch five minutes of this film. More can be done with a few shadows than a full palette of colors.I first saw this film in college. We had a new student union which had a nice little theater in it. I had heard of the film, but this was pre-rental, pre VCR, so if one were to see such a film, you had to simply wait. Even television tended to avoid this as too artsy. I sat at the screening. There were a couple of football players in the audience (I could tell by their jackets). I remember being mystified and confused and wanting to see the film again. It took about five years until it showed up on television and, even though there were about 60 commercials, I still enjoyed it. When I got my first VCR, it was the first movie I rented. What a trip. Anyway, as we left the theater, one of the football players said to the other, 'Well that was the biggest pile of crap I've ever seen.' This just reaffirmed that it was a great film. I'm sure that most average film-goers are not willing to put in the effort to get the most out of this film. That's their prerogative. I've often hated pretentious films that others have clucked their tongues about. If you look at my reviews of movies like 'Attack of the Crab Monsters' you will see I am not a film snob, but this is one great movie and I hope everyone gets to see it before they go down that last hill in that little red sled.",10,1,3,10 March 2006
Darkest Hour," Well Acted but Historically Contrived
","Winston Churchill is one of history's most enigmatic figures. As Great Britain watches Europe fall to the Nazis, most of the leaders sit, hands in their pockets, trying to figure out what to do. Neville Chamberlain has sold the country out, thinking he has become buddies with Hitler. Of course, the scourge of history would simply see that as avoiding an obstruction. So the call on gnarly old Winston, whose reputation in other confrontations is not that good (according to this film). So we are going to see a biographical presentation of this great man. What we get is a guy that can't go twenty minutes without downing four fingers of whiskey or smoking a dozen cigars a day. He is doddering and forgetful. That's OK. Maybe that was him. I suspect not quite as severe. While this movie portrays the time pretty accurately, they repeatedly stick him in situations where he can deliver pithy comments. A secretary, the young woman who portrayed Rose on Downton Abby, is his confidante. There is a scene on the subway. Did any of this ever take place. I know it is historical 'fiction,' but we deserve a bit more. It's not a terrible movie, hence my rating, but don't write a book report using the events presented here.",7,0,2,12 January 2019
Monster," She Never Had a Chance
","Having spent much of my youth in the presence of losers and the disenfranchised, this movie really hit home. There's no question that the Academy Award went to the correct person. The combination of rage and despair are so admirably presented a character as complex as the creases on her expressive face. It's the ultimate vicious circle. We tend to vilify someone like this because we only see the surface. But inside is that good heart that would love to become whole, but the past has too many tentacles and there are too many bruises that would need to be treated. She has no defenses. Even acting to save herself, she starts the ball rolling toward her destruction. We forget this is actually a love story, but the cards are stacked to the heavens. Great performances by Theron and Ricci. The latter brings a knowing innocence and we wonder if she will have an opportunity. Not comfortable to watch, but we need to see it.",9,0,2,2 June 2011
The Birth of a Nation," Hard to Separate Form from Content
","I don't know what prompted Griffith to make this film. Ignorance abounded. The South was reeling from the post Civil War era. The book, the Klansman, was probably pretty popular, just like anti Muslim books became popular after 9/11. This in no way should make such content acceptable. As we look at historical curiosities, this film falls into that category. I bought a VHS copy of this a few years ago because I had never actually seen it (I had watched isolated clips on cinema retrospectives). My wife and I were stunned by the content, although we knew what it was about. To see it, makes it even worse. Nevertheless, since I've been educating myself about film history and craft over many years, I felt I really needed to watch it with both a critical and a societal eye. One thing I saw was masterful images of war on film made in 1915. I saw motion and shadows and all the other things the early geniuses did to separate themselves from the also rans. The editing is excellent. The acting is emotive and appropriate for the time period. I have seen other Griffith films and know that this was a mistake. He could have applied his genius to another milieu, but he didn't. I doubt that anyone takes the content of this film seriously. If it weren't so sad, it would be downright amusing. The stereotypes are so lame and over the top. But we need to place ourselves in the historical context and evaluate it that way. Mostly, however, we need to look at it as one piece in the process of the development of cinema.",8,4,7,3 April 2006
Memento," Mind Blowing
","I spent considerable time doing research on the brain for a class I was teaching.  One of the most intriguing things I dealt with was the idea of short term memory.  There are cases of people who carry around a suitcase with them, containing all the things they need to continually review to stay in the present with any sort of functionality.  I had heard about this film and read a very sketchy review.  I rented it because I knew my family wouldn't be interested in the violence.  So late at night, I sat and took this film in with total concentration.  I need to watch it again, but right now it may have cracked my top ten list.  The last time I was so enthralled by a film was Coppola's 'The Conversation.'  Both of these films are fairly bleak and occasionally confusing and absolutely captivating. How anyone can be bored by this with all the junk that is being produced these days, I will never understand.  I know it's a gimmick film.  I know it's manipulative. So what?  Don't all films manipulate us, especially those steeped in mystery and suspense.  I knew exactly what was going on and I couldn't wait to see how it ended (began).  At first there are so many questions--why the self mutilation?  Why are these people treating this man this way?  Where is he?  How did he get there?  Who does he work for?  Does he actually work for anyone?  And yet, how skillfully is is all done.  I suppose if you want to begin nit picking, you can come up with a few inconsistencies.  This doesn't detract from the way that the principle character floats from even to even, trying to recoup his memory each time he faces the day.  The one thing I will grant is the emotional investment required for revenge--but because he is aware of his shortcomings, he feels he must act.  If  you are bored with most movies these days, rent this and it will affect you for a long time.",9,0,3,7 November 2001
Inglourious Basterds," Hey, It's Tarantino!
","I've read so many of the naysayers. Giving this a one rating seems really spiteful. They speak of Walz's excellence in his role. If there is an actor of such incredible skill, how can one give it one star. Yes this is violent. Yes it is gratuitous. Yes it stretches the bound of reality. But Tarantino pushes the envelope at every turn in every movie. My God, what about 'Django Unchained.' There will always be flying body parts and characters of almost supernatural proportions. The plot that leads to the face-off in the movie theater is very intricate and does stretch our believability meter, but it is really engaging. Yes, the Germans are interesting in their own ways. Remember, this is not a propaganda film. We are put into a setting that is not for one instance a real portrayal of an historical event. But it does draw out the evils of war and makes a serious statement. It does have heroes and heroines. I know at times I was left a bit confused as to the point, but it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the movie itself.",8,0,0,15 July 2014
Amistad," Gut Wrenching Portrayal
","If I wanted to and had the time, I could dismantle every historical film ever made. As good as 'Lincoln' was, one could get into angels on the heads of pins if you wanted to. So, do we not make Amistad? Do we quibble over whether John Quincy Adams said this, or what the political fervor was at the time. Those who criticize this film for its historicity need to realize that the scholars have also put their own imprints on the events. Movies make a point. Rather than dis things because your scholarship found something wrong with it (in some cases for the sake of your own racism), take into account that the events that took place on the cinematic Amistad were typical of what did happen and the actions of the slave traders were typical of what often happened. The scene where the chained slaves were allowed to drown without a by your leave should be enough. Do people still actually doubt that slavery was a bad thing and continue to not see the implications? This film may be fiction, but it is grounded in truth. By the way, even documentaries are a form of fiction in that the producers and directors add their own editing and control the images.",9,1,5,5 January 2017
Shakespeare in Love," Rollicking, Crative, and Fun
","Whether there is an iota of truth in this film (it's very doubtful there is), it is a wonderful creation. It sets the bards longing in the Elizabethan period, where life was short, theatre was king, and competition for attention was everywhere. Christopher Marlowe was no Shakespeare, and he met a tragic death, so let's see what happens when you throw the two together. Take all the lessons about the period and the Globe, have those young boys playing female parts. Have Shakespeare riding a roller coaster of depression. Take Gwyneth Paltrow's character, absolutely stunning. Throw them into the hopper and let it happen. Many more articulate people can comment with a great deal more scholarship than I have. But this movie is one of a kind and very refreshing and very, very satisfying. It has humor, tragedy, and a nice edge to keep it from being a fantasy.",9,1,2,26 February 2007
Iron Man 2," Some of the Shine Is Off
","With the eye-popping special effects front and center, we need to again delve beneath the surface and figure what separates this from other blockbuster superhero movies. This is a fairly captivating effort, but it doesn't really advance things that much. I suppose Robert Downey looked tired because he was, after all, dying in the film, but I also got that little bit of smugness that comes from walking through the part. Still, there's a great villain who can match well and some great technology to keep things interesting. One of the demands of this is to make your protagonist somewhat vulnerable. It falls just a bit short at times in catching us. Still, I liked the byplay and the fun and don't regret having seen it. I liked the first much better because it has a more sophisticated plot and substructure.",7,0,3,29 December 2010
Seven Years in Tibet," Insane Intolerance
","While it take some time to get moving, this is a truly captivating film. It's about redemption and pain. It's about true events which cast the Tibetan culture against the Chinese's land grab. We have the Buddhists on the one hand, and the godless hordes on the other. The die is cast and all we can do is watch. This is a movie about a selfish character and his comrade who find respite in the Himalaya's in the temple of the Dalai Lama. The gentleness and trust of the people is betrayed by one of them but it really wouldn't have mattered. There is a nice relationship developed between the young Lama and Brad Pitt's selfish, pig headed Westerner. Apparently there are elements of truth to this story. One feels so helpless in a world like this with so little one can do. It finally gets to what the Buddhists preach. Absolute dedication to their beliefs down to the last person.",9,17,27,17 September 2010
The Hunger Games," Something Lacking
","I have no experience with this book series, so I went into the theater with only a cursory knowledge of what I was to see. Mostly from word of mouth and random commentary. This allowed me to view it as 'just another movie.' While I thought the premise interesting, I could never put aside the question as to why these events had evolved in this culture. I know the whole thing is a metaphor showing how media, left to its designs, could be the destruction of us. That said, I think that 'Rollerball' used the same basic premise, the hero tilting at the oppressive gamesmen. Here we have the young woman, who in order to save a small child from certain death, finds herself in a fight for her own life. Everything is orchestrated as a TV show with smiling show host who have somehow managed to be put in positions of power. There is apparently a greater power which is never defined that has a stranglehold on the populace. Other than being chosen to be on the show, it isn't clear what their methods of control are. I guess they will starve them to death. Maybe they have weapons that could slaughter an entire population or something of this sort, but I never got the message. I thought the competition was also confusing. Why did the powers intervene at times? Was it just good television or did they have favorites? Maybe I'm dense, but I also had trouble understanding the point of some of the competitions. The acting is quite good and so are the special effects, and I didn't dislike the movie. I just felt that it left a lot of questions unanswered, and that most of the issues have been dealt with more effectively in previous films. A side-note: Other than their being visually interesting, is there any other reason for the wacky appearance of some of the characters who hold power. Are they like the people who dress up for NFL games in the most bizarre costumes, face paint in all.",7,0,3,22 January 2013
Zootopia," What a Great Surprise
","I hadn't planned on seeing this film (I feel we are over-saturated with animated films these day, most of them mediocre), but I looked on as my kids watched it. This is a really fine film. It takes on issues of prejudice and cultural diversity. Zootopia is a city where animals live side by side, predator and prey. It is not a utopia because law and order is necessary. A little female rabbit messes with the male dominated police force. She is put on duty as a meter maid and realizes sexism along with her species is under attack. She is feisty and eventually hooks up with a con-man fox (the least trusted species) whom she enlists to help her solve a kidnapping case. Actually, it's otter napping. In the process, she reveals her own prejudices and hurts her partner. The movie has stunning animation and intelligent dialogue and lots of social references. Very good stuff.",9,59,85,25 December 2016
12 Monkeys," Too Many Unanswered Questions
","While I didn't dislike this movie, I had to put aside any understanding about the implications of time travel that stuck in my mind. I love time travel movies, but they always leave a bittersweet taste for me. The story is interesting but I can never get beyond the point of 'What is he trying to do?' The effects launched by travel into the past are so fundamentally unpredictable, they can't stand up. He says he can't change things and then goes about changing things. I can sense the frustration in Bruce Willis's character. He is trying to buy favor with his own time. But how can he even have his own time if he changes the past, even in the smallest way. We could go on. Once we just choose to ignore these questions, we have a basic chase movie where the kidnap victim does begin to relate to her captor and his cause. I just can't get past the previously mentioned factors. I will give Bruce Willis credit. He plays the haunted, victimized creature he becomes very well. Brad Pitt plays a very tightly wound nut case as well.",7,0,0,9 February 2010
Au Revoir les Enfants," So Sad What We Do to Each Other
","Set in a French boarding school during the occupation of France by the Nazis, the silences of this film are thundering. We get to know intimately a group of boys, two in particular, one a French boy and the other a Jewish boy whose identity is being covered up. As the boys go through the all the day to day turmoil involved in their close quarters, the threat hangs heavily on the outside. The German soldiers aren't initially portrayed as villainous, but we know what will happen if the news gets out. This is a film about a time when one word can destroy a life. Unfortunately, children often act before they think. This film is subtle. It's about a friendship. Louis Malle, a king among directors, never beats us up with the events. Watching this with hindsight, it made me very sad. I also see that even in our own country, certain groups are now being minimalized. We need to learn from history.",10,1,2,13 October 2010
42," More Baseball than Personal History
","My first reaction to sports films is how realistic sports action is. If you are a long time fan, it's easy to spot inaccuracies and lame moments. This one does a nice job of making the on-field events believable. They did a nice job of showing how Robinson was quite a remarkable player. I don't know what Branch Rickey was really like. Harrison Ford certainly made him a crusty, driven person who has decided to leave a legacy. What may be missing are the more subtle aspects of race discrimination. We are used to the white- only restrooms and the hotels. Those were visible things that most would be aware of. What could have strengthened this movie would be the edgy treatment blacks would have received, less blatant, but every bit as destructive. Except for Pee Wee Reese and the guy who got traded because of his hostility, we don't have a whole lot of interaction among the Dodger players. I remember Reese as a kind, friendly person who used to do the Game of the Week with Dizzy Dean on Saturdays. Sometimes his character is too good; we don't really get to know him very well. He must have had a price to pay as well, coming from Kentucky. These are things that would turn a good, fairly inspirational movie into a really serious study of segregation and how it affected America.",8,0,0,8 June 2013
Shaun of the Dead," Fun for the Whole Family
","My son dragged me to see this. I've gone with him to his comic book movies, his other zombie movies, and on and on. So I was set for one of those Dad-is- willing-to-give-up-a-day things. This utterly tongue in cheek masterpiece had me from the get-go. There are so many sight gags and pop culture references, so many goofy encounters, so much character to the undead, I really enjoyed this. I see now why it became a cult film because it is infinitely quotable and full of absurdities. It also has a really fine cinematic sense. I also loved what the role of the zombies is at the end of the picture. If one has ever worked with high school boys (or lazy male young adults), you will find a great deal to enjoy here. Really!!!",9,2,5,10 January 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," It's Fun, But Does Anyone Know When to Stop
","Sometimes I think they sell movies by the pound. This is a pretty delightful tale. The sea creatures, the special effects, Johnny Depp's prancing, tilting Jack Sparrow, interesting rules of the sea, Davey Jones. But it is an eternity. Just like the first one, I thought it would never end. What could be much more suspenseful and captivating is dragged on for two and a half hours. A snip here and there would have done wonders for this film. One thing that always bothers me is the complexity of the hero's task; we are submerged in a whirlpool of details. At times I think the characters themselves are confused by what's going on. How could they know?Still, it's nice to see someone put forth the effort to tell a really nifty adventure yarn. The sea puts forth obstacles that we don't have on terra firma. It has its own legends and its own being, and it's really quite wet. I like the hammer head guy and the octopus-like Jones. Obviously, the makeup people put in a lot of overtime. It also sets up episode three. See it, but it's quite an investment.",8,0,3,20 February 2007
Argo," Good Story Telling/Don't Take it as Gospel
","Had this movie been made twenty years from now, when facts become distorted, the people who followed the details are either dead or indifferent, and the whole thing is pretty much ancient history, this would be a great story. Just like 'The Charge of the Light Brigade' is a fun movie, even if it is about ninety percent inaccurate. This is because the producers would like you to believe all of the near misses, the interventions, and so on were truly what happened. There are enough people on the internet who will happily discount them, using good evidence to do so. Now, this leads us to an interesting pass. Can we accept any historical movie as being well done when those making it didn't have the wherewithal to see the events. LIke historical fiction, as soon as we quote dialogue, we are on untrustworthy waters. However, this would dismiss many great movies. I'm afraid this one is still too fresh in our consciousness. I'm wondering if someone in 2045 will see this and comfortably absorb the 'facts' as presented. Divorcing myself from reality, I can see this as a great yarn. Like 'The Killing Fields' or other historical dramas where people face their mortality at every juncture, can we enjoy the very intense situations that our people have been thrown into. This is a very individual thing. I enjoyed this movie for the most part because I found the characters engaging, the 'enemy' human and righteous (considering our connection to the Shah), and the situation terrifying. I expect this will get a lot of attention at awards time. I saw Jimmy Carter at Obama's second inauguration the other day. This movie must not be a pleasant experience for him because he was vilified because of his performance. Reagan was able to pick up the pieces because the Iranians had already humiliated Carter, which was part of their agenda. Watch with a grain of salt and realize this is not a documentary.",7,1,2,22 January 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Too Many Rules to Follow
","I certainly enjoyed this movie. Johnny Depp's mugging and swashbuckling. His sly expressions. The conflict with the power structure which would like to see him hanged. The special effects are quite impressive. There are two problems that kept me from giving this the ultimate rating. It is way too long. I don't know if they edited anything out of this. The thing with the ghost ship was endless. Secondly, like a video game, there were all these rules we were supposed to remember. The ones that mortals are supposed to play by and the ones the ghosts must play by. I'm starting to feel that for some films, we should be given a handbook to keep it all straight. Perhaps an in-service of some kind. When this is mostly a pirate movie, it is great fun. There are battles; there is tongue in cheek commentary. There are beautiful women who can stand up to any man; you name it. When the supernatural element enters in, it is also fun. But there's something about being forced to kill people that are already dead. Just exactly is it that you must do? Again, play by the rules. Anyway, it's a wonderful romp. It almost gets resolved in the end, and we're ready for more.",8,0,3,7 April 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," Too Many Fistfights but Enjoyable
","As with most my age (mid-sixties), I've been through them all. Every attempt to nuance the regiment of characters that have spanned the realizable galaxy that is the home of the Star Trek conglomerate. I am pleased that there is less self-caricature than previously, less smirking and lame attempt at humor. This is an admirable attempt at a really good adventure. One of the reviewers likened it to 'Raiders' and its ilk. The problem for me is that while I was taken in once again by a pretty good adventure story with amazing special effects, when I left, I had nothing that stayed with me more than a few hours. One of the problems with the high-tech world and the incredible expense involved is that we slip back to the lowest common denominator, lest we lose a less hip audience. My contention is that we can have highly intelligent science fiction without catering strictly to the nerd element or comic book purists. That involves writing. That involves not having an incredibly complex set of circumstances resolved through a fistfight on some Harold Lloyd, moving girder set. I think the potential is there. How about stretching things a bit more. When 'The City on the Edge of Tomorrow' appeared lo those many years ago, the arrogant wunderkind Harlan Ellison took the Trek people to a wonderful place by 'writing a really good script.' Since Hollywood can do things it never could before, how about tapping into it and doing something incredible. I thought that our refugee from Sherlock Holmes had a great sinister quality that should have been embraced. So much for that. He is pretty much talk and pretty vulnerable.Again, I think this is well worth seeing, but I think that there is so much potential for something glorious.",8,5,10,7 June 2013
12 Angry Men," It Blends Together
","This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.",10,0,1,17 February 2006
Beauty and the Beast," A True Musical
","It's interesting that for a time, the best music written for the stage was being introduced in animated features, mostly by Disney. This is one of the best and it translated well to Broadway. From the opening sequence of Belle, with her strong character, to the dancing household items at the Beast's castle, this has got to be one of Disney's finest productions. It has heart and soul. It has Gaston, a great villain, with a great song bearing his name. He is the epitome of male chauvinism. It is remindful of Miles Gloriosus in 'A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.' The fairy tale plays itself out with delightful pacing. The beast is a complex being who has a second chance for rebirth and reconciliation. That there are forces in the universe makes this a positive film. The scare factor is there as well, with the thorny forest of the Beast, providing a barrier to all who dare enter. It shows that love can be easy, but true love without sacrifice is empty. Until the Beast knows this his lot will continue on. The songs are complex and varied, some of the best every. All the characters have purpose. This is an outstanding film.",9,1,2,21 March 2006
The English Patient," Totally Captivating
","I have had this film on my radar since it won the Oscar lo these many years. It is described as romantic drama and the sound of it turned me off. Now that I've seen it, I know why it was so highly thought of. Those who criticize it seem to have two axes to grind. It's too long and the characters are unlikeable. I never thought for a moment that the film was too long; I didn't even notice the length. As for the characters, they are what they are, incredibly complex. Throw people into the mess of war and they don't behave 'properly.' This is a movie about undying love and the reality of conflict. We continue to fight wars despite the toll they produce. Human beings aren't satisfied with being the chosen species, they have to go about taking that from others. I know this sounds simplistic. Of course, wars need to be fought, but the price is great. Yes the main characters are selfish and passionate and don't look back very well. People to cheat and divorce and act on baser instincts, but the movie lets us know why their motives are. Sometimes I think that people would like a cotton candy presentation of life. Well, that's not art. Art gets at the guts of what we are and presents it to us, even if we don't like it. I thought Fiennes character was at times a total ass. He took and didn't give back. He catalogued his life inside a copy of Herodotus, creating a scrapbook of his existence. There are also our peripheral characters. Kip and Hana who are also victims of war, and the Dafoe character who hasn't lost as much but is marked for life. Everyone grows, even in the faith of death, and the spirit lives on. This is one marvelous film.",10,7,12,4 February 2010
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," So Outrageous, It's Hilarious
","While I've never gotten addicted to 'South Park,' I have watched lots of episodes and get a real kick out of it. As it is with the movie, the kids are simply moving through an existence that has been created by their short sighted and bigoted parents. When they swear, it's so natural that it almost has a poetic rhythm. If one of them feels his feeling are hurt (especially Cartman), he retaliates with a blast of profanity. In some cases, as with the 'C' word, the characters don't even know what they are dealing with. They take advice as genuine and go from there. No one gets left out when it comes to a lambasting. The parents are the real nut cases. The kids are trying to find a way to get their heroes, the Canadian comedy team, off of death row where the parents and the military have put them for misleading their youth. Who's doing the misleading? The subplot in Hell with Satan and Saddam Hussein is amazing. Satan is a really sensitive, introspective fellow, while Saddam is the nut case maniac. This, of course, is pre 9/11. In addition to the clever animation and voices, there are some great songs. 'Blame Canada' is great and 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?' is so over the top, it makes me giggle. Why did they pick this person as the object of the song other than for us to ask this question. I know this movie isn't for everyone (maybe most people), but if you can stand the assault, it's about as clever as anything can be.",8,0,0,24 April 2006
The Danish Girl," Certainly Touchy Subject Matter
","There was a time when I would have seen this as a contrived, shocking piece. But as I've got to know people in the LGBT community, it now has more to do with the reality that people experience daily. Sometimes it is a significant event that brings discovery. This seems to be the case here. I know that some didn't like the portrayal and have decided to sabotage the rating system. I'd rather they didn't review it at all if their motivations are simply to promote their prejudices. While this was in a milieu about which I have no experience, I thought the characters striking and unique and the story also quite remarkable. Take a chance on this.",8,1,3,6 May 2019
Ted," Sophomoric Craziness
","I'm an old guy, but I also can take a joke. My son encouraged me to join him for this movie. I found it quite engaging. There are films that are deliberately crude, hitting the lowest common denominator. Others have deep charm (sort of the ET complex). This film manages to take that charm which we occasionally fall for, and put a bullet in its head. It is full of great lines (listen for the beginning Apache helicopter bit) and sight gags. Some don't work, but most do, and what we haves one strange film. Family Guy knows no boundaries and so it's not surprising that the film is the same. Ted is a mess. He is the victim of the fate of the child actor (although he is a rather nondescript Teddy bear). Mark Walberg is just vacuous enough to pull this off. It may be his best role because he has to show a balance of kindness and utter stupidity when it comes to his old friend. They are comrades in arms and when romance comes in, the bear is going to take first place. This is wonderfully creative and engaging. Ted should get a couple of Golden Globe nominations (I mean the bear, not the movie).",9,1,6,17 July 2012
Knives Out," Lots of Nice Little Twists
","No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity.",8,5,12,29 March 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," A Story of Passion and Commitment
","I can't add a lot to what has been written. The direction and cinematography aside (which is magnificent), this is an incredible psychological study, involving a group of the most complex of characters. Esposito finds himself in love with two people: the woman who was once his boss and because of inaction, left him heartbroken, and, secondly, a beautiful young rape/murder victim. Over a twenty-five year period, these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time, we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also, in the middle is the messed friend, an alcoholic, who can be a true talent, but is submerged in his problems, spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him, you will see why I choose this character as a reference. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It has it all.",10,13,13,27 February 2016
Billy Elliot," Is It Hanging on the Shirttails of the Musical
","It's certainly a good story. It has heroes and villains and the heart of the artist put to the test. The reason I didn't react to it so well is that I've been there a hundred times before. That is not to say a movie about following your dream isn't valid. It's in the telling and I didn't feel anything new. That said, the performances are quite good. The clashes over artistry are more subtle than I thought they would be. The connection made, finally, with the father and his sacrifices are worthy. But for me, it seemed clichéd. Even that connection appeared a bit contrived and out of character with someone in such a volatile setting. I know that this is an immensely popular musical that is sweeping the country in 2012 after years in European venues. I will see it if I have a chance. I have a suspicion that the music raises it and the dancing puts a punctuation mark on it. Perhaps the story is made more by nature of the artistic extension.",7,0,0,19 September 2012
Batman Returns," Batman Gets the Bird
","This is really quite good with more exposition and character development. We are introduced to two more staples of the Batman stable, the Penguin and Cat Woman. The Penguin's origins are brought forth in this episode as are Cat Woman's. The Penguin is set on taking over the city. There are evil politicians and crooked workers that Bruce Wayne must deal with. The Penguin looks like a lightweight, but he is, indeed a formidable enemy. Batman is immediately struck by the beauty of Cat Woman (played by the stunning Michelle Pfeiffer). The efforts to quell the situation set up by the Penguin and do it quickly, is the problem Batman must face. With Michael Keaton at the helm, Batman is a bit more cynical and harsh. Batman continues to be a force in the film industry to this day. One of the better episodes.",9,1,7,29 December 2016
Finding Nemo," Great Animation/Delightful Characters
","Pixar brings it on. This wonderful trip to the bottom of the sea is worth watching again and again. It centers around a misbehaving clownfish who gets himself taken away to a faraway place, with little hope of ever seeing his father again. The characters along the way are priceless, with clever dialogue, quirky sensibilities, and, ultimately, love for one another. The creators were able to capitalize on the innate, somewhat stereotypical, qualities of the individual sea denizens by using some of our current comic geniuses (like Ellen DeGeneres) and make them charming. If you've not seen this, make time. You don't even need the kids.",9,2,3,7 August 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Too Many Sour Notes
","My son got me involved in these movies and, having not grown up reading the X-men, I am frequently forced to ask questions of him to clarify the events. That being said, I have enjoyed the movies mostly and have picked up on some of the ethos. This one is interesting in that it explains some things, disappointing in that there are so many unexplained phenomena in it. I do like Hugh Jackman, the angst ridden protagonist, but the story is so over the top that it leaves me with more questions than when I entered the theater. I also have trouble with the powers that characters have and which are more powerful than others and what their weaknesses are. Are they indeed incapable of being destroyed one time and vulnerable the next. Yes, I know the comic books explain these things but with all their sophisticated abilities, they still spend most of their time pounding on each other. Do they know that for some a thump on the head just doesn't do the job. Oh, well. None of it is that serious and there is a lot of action, even if it doesn't always make sense.",6,3,6,14 August 2009
That Thing You Do!," Those Things They Did
","What a nice movie. There was a time when a garage band could put together a hit, find someone to listen to it, and get on the charts. Here, a group called the Oneders (pronounced Wonders) writes and performs a song and manages to get noticed by a record producer, played by Tom Hanks. Soon, they find themselves on a band competition where the emcee announces them as the o-need-era. When the achieve a reasonable success, they face the challenges that many bands did, artistic direction. One of the undermines things be not taking the whole thing seriously, and the women in their lives cause other issues. Their lack of experience in the big, bad world is also an issue. How far can they go with what they have. This is a quiet, charming story that focuses in on the lives of these everyday guys.",8,0,1,2 January 2017
The Mummy," A Lot of Sand
","Wow, 250 people have commented on this movie already. What can I say to add to their many comments. I guess first of all, 'Who is this mummy, and why has he been granted so much power?' For a guy who is a common adulterer, how has he accumulated enough points to get to be such a big shot. Why does he look like a masking tape version of the morphing creature in Terminator II. Why are there cowboys in this movie? Why does Brendan Fraser look like George of the Jungle after being in prison for two years. How does he keep coming back after being hit with a stick in the kidneys. Why does everyone know where the mummy is and where that gold book is. How do they commute from Cairo back and forth to the secret city (is that the one with the Casino out front)? Ooh! The secret city. What a secret. Why didn't someone dig this stuff up about 200 years ago. Oh, that's right, there was a map, wasn't there, but the cowboys have the map too. Where did they get that. There must be two maps. Then. of course, there is the mummy's mouth. Do you remember anything about mummy's having large mouths. Why does everyone who isn't alive have a large mouth? Why did they put the princess's body parts in the jars. What would have happened if someone had just blown away a couple of those jars. Where did that guy get the job guarding the secret city, and why is he so lousy at it? Why are those bugs there? What do they eat when they're just waiting around for tourists to show up at the secret city. How do you kill the dead--and do you really want to? Who is the mummy scared of--is it those same guys that came up and got the bad guys in 'Ghost?' Why does Brendan Frazier get a couple of years in prison for killing about 600 Egyptians. I don't know--I have to say that if I watched this and never asked myself any questions, it's just silly enough to entertain--my son liked it and I respect his sense of joy. There are certainly a lot of things jumping out and hands touching shoulders during tense scenes. I know this whole thing is tongue in cheek and is supposed to mimic the 1940's B movies, but with a little more imagination it could have done this and been a pretty cool movie! Perhaps they could have even added a little suspense!",7,0,0,18 May 1999
The Natural," It's for all time; a baseball mythos
","Whenever 'The Natural' is on TV, I stop what I'm doing and watch it. I don't know why, exactly. I have been a baseball fan since I was a little kid and love the tradition. There is no other sport that has as much history. It's because one can isolate moments in time. Situations develop. Every announcer says things like, 'Bottom of the third, men on first and third, Turley on the mound, Simpson is up, he's two for four today. The wind is blowing out to right field, etc.' We can make words visual. In this wonderful movie, a man wants a piece of that tradition. He makes a horrible mistake along the way to the big leagues, and now is given one last chance. This is mythical. This is not realistic. To criticize it on the basis of its credibility is unfair. Even to compare it to the book is unfair. They are totally different. What one does with a camera should not be compared to the printed page. Malamud did his thing and now Barry Levinson is doing his. The cinematography is without peer. It is magical all the way through. The lighting as Glenn Close stands up in the stands is mesmerizing. This is more Greek myth than baseball story, but it is a baseball story, with the Ruth like gods and the day-to-day players. Roy Hobbs is like all of us in some ways and we love him for his endurance, patience, and drive. Redford brings him to life with that rugged face moving away from lost youth. It's a fine film.",9,81,90,23 March 2006
Dead Poets Society," Good but Not Great
","Having taught English for 43 years, I have stood in the place Robin William's character has. Some days you look out over the herds of kids that pass before you and you cry for them. As a teacher who put his heart and soul into what I did, I tried to make impressions help them master life skills. The sad reality is that one does one's best to crack the numbers game. Every year we have a few of those students who we try to embrace and find the right direction for them, but we are so hamstrung. The first thing I thought when evaluating this film is the little group of kids that he dealt with. He got to know each of them intimately. Of course, it's a prep school, but even then he should have had a couple other full classrooms. What he does is admirable and exciting. That he throws himself into his work to such an extent is amazing. But let's face it. This is a formulaic film that has been done many times before. It is monument building and flying in the face of establishment whose soul purpose is to ruin these kids' lives. There's a kind of narcissism to think that in this group we have bunch of directionless idiots who could never think for themselves. It sends a positive message but the population is carefully put together to send that message. It's just not real.",7,1,1,31 March 2018
Brokeback Mountain," So Touching and So Very Sad
","This is a film that brought some things into the mainstream. To have two very masculine characters portrayed in a sensitive way as they profess their love for each other was a major event in cinema and in culture. I know there will be naysayers, but I felt this was one of the most poignant films ever produced. It is rife with sadness and pain. The two men must go through contortions to maintain their relationship. And there is a great tragedy here.",10,0,0,2 May 2019
Ed Wood," Eternal Optimism
","I just never got around to seeing this. It was worth the wait. Ed Wood was one of the most optimistic beings ever to set foot on this earth. He had a love for life and a spirit that, unfortunately, greatly outpaced his talent. One thing to remember is that money always influences art. Some of the shortcomings of his films had to do with extra takes costing money. Film has never been cheap. But this need to be efficient and timely, also led us to some of the most memorable (though bad) footage in film history. The fact is that he 'did' get the films made. He did have a family of actors that stood by him. He did eventually find someone to accept his being a transvestite. I don't think 'worst director ever' is quite fair because those guys never got a film made, let alone any for major release. Then there is his relationship with the morphine riddled Bela Lugosi who becomes dependent on him. Wood gave graciously, looked out for the sad old man, and brought him 'back to life.' Martin Landau's performance is outstanding as the classic horror star, living with regrets and what ifs. Tim Burton pulls this off beautifully, giving his film the cheap appearance of Wood's films. Depp is charming as the ever positive Wood, always making lemonade when life threw him a new lemon. Excellent film.",9,2,2,7 August 2015
Chicken Run," I've Never Heard so Many Poultry Puns
","I would say it's a hoot, but it's about chickens, and a cluck just doesn't do it. In this masterwork of modern claymation, a flock of chickens realize that their World War II concentration camp setting is going result in all of them becoming dinner. Along comes Mel Gibson as a chicken (I suppose after saving the Colonies in 'The Patriot' he needed other things to do. Anyway, the chickens are soon empowered to try to save themselves with the help of Mel. They become industrious. They already have some pretty amazing anthropomorphic talents, but trying to escape has not been one of them. They are ruled over by the Tweedys, a clumsy husband and wife team who start to realize what is happening. Because they are not doing well in the egg business, they buy a pie machine with the thought of butchering their animals and making them into pies. So the chips are down. Great animation and a really interesting premise.",9,0,0,10 January 2017
Home Alone," Just for Fun
","My response to this movie is strictly prejudiced. For all it violence and lack of verisimilitude, I get a kick out it ever time I see it. If one can't get past the fact that the Wile E. Coyote element is in here (where no one ever seems to get hurt, no matter what), you aren't going to have much fun. With that caveat, the movie is a bit of a hoot. McCauley Culkin came to stardom in this (it's too bad his life became unsettled after this). Watching Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the ever optimistic though doomed villains, continue to fight a losing cause against an eight year old is the stuff cartoons are made of. Their mugging as they try one thing after another, only to be thwarted, is great fun. The subplot of the mother hooking up with a polka band, led by the inimitable John Candy, adds an element of joy. There is also the relationship that grows with a frightening man next door who has been tabbed a murderer by the insensitivity of the neighborhood kids. This man is estranged from his son and has lapsed into a sad existence. This raises this up from just a kid movie to one with a bit more substance. Anyway, don't take it to seriously and one may have a bit of fun at the holidays.",8,0,1,2 January 2015
The Hustler," A Truly Great Movie
","I waited about forty years to finally watch this film. It is a tale of both depravity and courage. Paul Newman is a pool hustler. He and his buddy go from pool hall to endless pool hall to scrounge up a few bucks. The thing is that Newman is a really gifted player and one day decides that he's had enough penny ante. The problem is that he is not wise to the ways of gamblers and the bigger hustlers. George C. Scott appears in one of his greatest roles. Piper Laurie is a spooky actress, but pulls off the alcoholic, depressed soul that hooks up with Newman and finds her ship may have sailed. Jackie Gleason really steals every scene. He is probably one of the greatest comic actors of all time, but has been relegated to that place where 'TV' people go. As Minnesota Fats, he is formidable but part of the real world. The cinematography of the dark halls is also marvelous and the direction grabs us and holds us.",10,3,5,1 September 2015
Spotlight," A Gem to Rival 'All the President's Men'
","I finally saw this film a few hours before tonight's Academy Awards broadcast. I had a feeling that it had the chops to win the big one. Many of my friends have been touting it. It takes a truly skilled director and screenwriter to entice an audience to watch something where they already know the result. We are made aware of the foothold of the Catholic Church in the city of Boston. When a new news director comes on board, he feeds the need for an investigation into priest misconduct to the Spotlight team, a group of hard core reporters who are unyielding in their persistent investigation of whatever story is there. The beauty of this film is that at no time is there a sense of sensationalism. Yes, the church tries to cut them off at the pass and uses sealed documents as a weapon, but time is the issue as much as anything visible. Strong performances abound, but the characters have weaknesses and at times become a bit emotional over their task. This plays out with subtlety and an almost you-are-there sense. Loved this.",10,17,29,28 February 2016
Insomnia," It Made Me Tired
","Al Pacino's character looked tired when he arrived in the Alaskan town. As he attempts to reconcile a serious mistake, he grows wearier and wearier. Enter Robin Williams, a sociopath who plays a cat and mouse game with Pacino. Balance that against the perceptive and admiring Hillary Swank and a lot of baggage from Pacino, and you have the ingredients for a terrific thrill a minute film. I found myself rooting for the Pacino character even though there is a level of dishonesty that will be hard to reconcile. He must cover some huge tracks. There are some issues with Williams' ability to know things that are a little far fetched. Many villains fall into that gap, but that's OK. We take him for what he is. It's an engaging movie.",9,0,0,26 May 2010
Juno," Not That Bad
","I don't understand the venom toward this film. It's about unconventional kids who act in ways that test their believability. I taught middle school kids for 43 years and had no trouble picking out some names who would match the people in this film. We tend to apply our own standards on the parents, thinking they should act a certain way. I thought that Ellen Page's Juno was quirky and spontaneous, and that she was also incredibly insecure. Even in people who are eccentric, there are causes and effects. This is a decent story. It's not a typical one and that grates on some.",6,0,0,4 May 2019
L.A. Confidential," The Fox Is Guarding the Chicken Coop!
","This is a great mood piece. It has a sense of time and place, not to mention some incredibly memorable characters. This is early Russell Crowe and he is really a movie presence. This has so many layers and yet it plays fairly. The people are multi-dimensional from James Cromwell, whom I love, to Kim Basinger, a really underrated actress. And, of course, Kevin Spacey is his solid self. I've seen so many portrayals of corrupt police forces and without a delicate touch, this could have been clichéd. It wasn't. We have a balance of show business and violence, drugs, you name it. We have an overzealous son of a cop who we start out hating and then begin to accept because he is driven in the right direction. I missed this the first time through during Titanic-mania, and I've always been turned off by the title (the tabloids of the fifties), but this doesn't fail to satisfy.",9,0,1,12 January 2010
The Jungle Book," Memorable Softened Version of Kipling Classic
","How can you not love this famous story. We are introduced to Mowgli, raised by wild animals, all of whom have memorable personalities. Most of them are benevolent creatures who direct the young man to a life where he is loved. Of course, the jungle is filled with threats, from Kaa to Shere Khan. There are wonderful songs an animation that knows no peer. This was produced in the Disney heyday and sparkles from beginning to end. There are other versions that put more fang into the story. They have their merits as well, but this is the one that most of us remember. It's a story of love and caring that all kids and adults should enjoy.",9,0,1,7 December 2016
The Day After Tomorrow," It's Cold Outside!
","When anyone begins to talk about a contemporary special effects film, he needs to start out with the fact that if you throw enough money at something, it will look impressive. What makes it a good movie is plausibility. Are the characters possible? Is the situation possible? Are there things that just don't work. The stuff that happened in 'Independence Day' is happening again. It's not aliens; it's us. We have opened the Pandora's box and let out all the evils with our radiation, our ozone layers, our whatever. So all of a sudden, the world is pretty much ending. There are so many remarkable things that come to pass, but the main one is that there are people who seem to understand everything that happens; they are experts on uncertainty. Give me a break. If things were as bad as this, the shock wave would be way too much to handle in such a short time. The only people who would survive would do so because of being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. I was astonished by people running down streets being chased by a wave of cold. Holed up in the big public library, burning books and furniture to keep the temperature up. It's just too much. The rescues are too unbelievable because they call for too much knowledge to pull off. It was a visually exciting film. If you are willing to suspend a ton of disbelief, you could get caught up in it. I never did.",5,1,3,16 March 2006
X-Men," The Start of Something Big
","My son brought me into the foray of comic book movies. I had low expectations. This one is quite expository, bringing us into contact with the principles of the X-men. We are introduced to Wolverine and the lot. The plot involves all of the planning, government meddling, and super-villains with whom I am not familiar. One thing that impressed me is the quality of the acting and the big time performers that contributed to this. It does leave unanswered questions, but I would assume there are answers galore as the blockbusters of the day seem to be about 90 percent directed to fanboys. I really enjoyed this, but am still a bit bewildered by who these guys are.",8,1,2,19 August 2015
Spider-Man 3," MIld Disappointment
","I have to remind myself of my age and my less than exciting view of high tech and computer generated images. In some ways, if you've seen one Spider-man movie you've seen them all. The action scenes have a similarity. It mostly has to do with people about to hit the ground, suddenly being swooped up at the last second. As experienced viewers, we know there isn't going to be a splat, especially if the victim is young and pretty. The best of the story rests with the villains and there are some good ones here. The Sand Man is really a fun creation, morphing and blowing around and coming back to his initial form. In this particular setting, there seems to be a lot of danger of innocent bystanders being victimized by forces over which they have no control (bitten by spiders?) In this film, Peter's turning over to the dark side could be understandable. He gets no credit for anything and the world has about a ten second attention span. Heroes become goats in a millisecond. Still this is a rapidly moving, fun film with some issues still up for grabs.",8,0,1,31 August 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," I Thought It Was Pretty Good
","Having a son who really loves these comic book movies stretches my appreciation for such presentations. We did watch the first one together years ago and it was decent. Since I'm way past the time when I would have read a comic book featuring most of these characters, I treated it as a movie, only using what happened in the first one as a reference point. I have extensive knowledge of the classics and a long time interest in world mythology. You folks who are all bent out of shape that the mythology got screwed up in this movie need to realize that it is totally screwed up in the comic books. Except for excessive battle scenes which eventually seem to be the same old same old, I rather liked the humor and the plotting. I may even go and see the next one. I'm hoping I don't have to keep saying to my adult son, 'Now, who is that guy?' Oh, I did like the guy made out of rocks.",8,2,8,30 November 2019
Match Point," American Tragedy Redux
","I really liked this film for some very perverse reasons. I wanted the 'bad guy' to get away with his crime. This is the story of a not quite successful tennis player who falls into the lap of wealth. He meets the wealthy son of a very rich man and proceeds to inveigle his way into their lives, including getting the daughter to fall in love with him. The kicker is a young actress with whom he falls in love. The former fiancée of the family son, he has a fling with her that leads to a pregnancy and a whole series of complications. The intrigue in the film, involve his efforts to cover up his double life and to figure a way out of his situation. This has Woody Allen's delicate touch as he allows his characters to work their ways through their respective challenges. It is gripping and satisfying.",9,0,1,30 April 2010
Midnight in Paris," Love the Literary Period
","I was really absorbed in this film. My loving connection with that Paris group got me off on the right foot. I know they are stock characters, but the pretentious idiocy of the future family of the Owen Wilson (Woody Allen) gives us a guy to root for. The tiresome being of the woman he is to marry would lead me to want her to be found floating face up in the Seine. Anyway, the fantasy world of the great writers is done charmingly with a second food in the present. It never gets silly and contrived with a limited amount of the conflict that other comedic directors could not handle. He slowly makes the rounds of his dreams and follows them, and the earth doesn't collapse. Actually, the woman in question really gets what she actually wanted. I won't spoil it by saying what that is. The characters vary in effectiveness. It was nice to see the portrayal of the young Hemingway with his bravado and insensitivity, even a touch of naiveté. There are romantic symbols and the cinematography is gorgeous. I know some think Owen Wilson is an odd choice for the protagonist, but I find him endearing and so patient. Also, there has been criticism that it's not edgy enough. The movie never tries to be a social statement. It's much more personal. When we leave the theater we feel that we have been involved in a little secret. The Philistines have been conquered in their own way and allowed to go on with their insipid, self-important lives.",9,0,0,25 May 2012
Zodiac," The World Doesn't Work That Way!
","This is a movie about process. It's about what happens when a case goes cold and simple answers don't suffice. It's a risk taken when one does a fictional presentation of an historical event from fairly recent times. You can stick tot he facts or simply make things up. I enjoyed this film because the three principle characters were real and human. All were in over their heads to some extent. Jake Gyllenhaal character makes that sometimes unfortunate serendipitous discovery and becomes obsessed. The police have done what they can, but without passion and this is what Gyllenhaal's character brings to the game. Unfortunately, so much time has passed and so much has gone cold. So everything is based on circumstance. We must content ourselves with what we find and give up on confessions or witnesses. I knew from the start what the case was about and I recommend that those sourpusses that complain about this film do a little reading (maybe one paragraph on Wikipedia which should handle your attention spans) and then decide whether you want to bother with this. Personally, I thought the acting was superb and it painted a picture of the frustration with trying to solve a case with only bits and pieces.",8,0,0,16 November 2010
Milk," A View of Greatness
","This is a remarkably acted film. Not just the Sean Penn performances (which is incredible), but the performances of an ensemble that so beautifully shows us that gay people are people with hopes, fears, and commitments. I recall the case involving the deaths of Harvey Mile and George Moscone in San Francisco. It was a high profile event at the time, but I wasn't mature enough in my views to care that much. This film embodies the cause and the pain and the sheer drive of the man in the title. He is portrayed as a relatively simple man who just happens to be gay, a person of great restlessness who finds himself in something bigger than he is. The film comes to life and carries us in its wave. It also recaptures the spirit of the time. It shows us what an amazing negative force Anita Bryant, a two bit singer, was able to wield over America. But, ultimately, it is a hopeful movie about the fundamental dreams of all people and how just being given the same rights as others is as hard as anything we face.",9,1,3,16 September 2009
The Prestige," A Film with Intellect
","I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece.",10,3,6,23 October 2006
The Terminator," Amazing Intensity
","When this film was released I hesitated, not being a big fan of Arnold's. But his stolid performance (without any emotion) was really quite good. The plot line of a thing from the future taking on human form and trying to put an end to a problem through murder is quite captivating. Of course, the issue of time travel to the past is always fodder for criticism. Of course, we have the sequels, using computer generated special effects (which are remarkable). I still prefer this first one.",9,1,2,31 December 2019
Cloverfield," LIke Most Films About Survival, It Does a Decent Job
","There are so many plot holes that it's hard to feel positively about this film. Still, it had a modicum of suspense and characters that we sort of cared for. The protagonist leads his peers on what should have been a hopeless venture. As a monster is attacking Manhattan, he manages to get to an apartment building, go into a building next door, and cross over to rescue his girlfriend. The possibility of any of this is beyond belief. Sad as he feels over his poor girlfriend's plight, he isn't going to rescue her. Oops! I spoke way too soon. Why are these monsters so set on knocking down skyscrapers? Are they hungry? Why would the idiot continue to film when everyone is running for their lives. But if you don't want to think too much, it will entertain you pretty well.",6,1,2,26 May 2016
Sleepy Hollow," Please Don't Call It a Remake of the Washington Irving Story
","Come on. If it weren't for the names of the characters, including the Headless Horseman, we wouldn't have clue that this had anything to do with the original. A remake has to have something to do with the original plot, even if it's butchered. For God's sake, Ichabod Crane is a police detective!? He comes to investigate murders using forensic techniques. Katrina Van Tassel is a potential suspect. Remember that Ichabod, in the original movie, was the victim. So let's let that go. If this is just a period piece it's a decent movie. It is well constructed and has some really interesting plot development. The detective must wade through the provincial prejudices against him and try to solve the murders. I suppose most of the people who went to this film had never read the original, but it bothers me that the title and characters have any connection to that story.",7,1,1,30 December 2016
Once," Subtle, Delicate, Real
","I admit that I saw the stage musical before renting the movie. They are both so touching and so human. The relationship that develops between the young street musician and the pretty Czech girl pulls us along with a velvet rope. It is cinematically stunning. I loved watching the two of them walking down the street, she pulling her 'Hoover' which he fixes for her. It's like a puppy on a leash. The charm of their interaction and ultimate love must face the factors of her fragile marriage and her effort to maintain a life for her daughter and her 'mudder.' He is on the verge of having success with his songwriting and performing and he must weigh that against pursuing his hopes for becoming a part of his life. It's sad but positive; loving and real. The acting is superb as they tussle with the hand they've been dealt. At no time does it become maudlin or predictable. Also, the music is striking and often sad. This is a true sleeper of a movie.",9,2,3,4 July 2014
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Cold War Chills
","You know. When you are dealing with a complex writer like LeCarre, you are going to get a complex movie. Unfortunately, to the casual viewer, there's an awful lot that is going on that is grounded in the long dark past. While the story of the search for a mole in the network is a valid pivot point, there are so many intricacies that you are left to guess. Perhaps I am not that bright, but I need a bit more. I guess the question is, do I need a George Smiley playbook or a stack of books to follow this film. If that's the case, how many people can appreciate this? The time period in issue is really in the fairly distant past. I have to agree that so much of what we see is really dumbed down, but when the plots are so slowly developed and depend on so much inside stuff, even the astute viewer is left in the lurch. It isn't that I didn't like it. But I may have to give it another shot to really appreciate it.",7,0,0,27 May 2012
The Hateful Eight," Excessive but Not With Great Results....Still
","When all is said and done, this is really a murder mystery. A stagecoach, in a snowstorm, approaches a wayside inn where it is obvious that people stop and have coffee. It is called Minnie's Haberdashery. Except, Minnie isn't there. Also, the cargo includes a couple bounty hunters and a woman who is being taken to be hanged. There are four other characters who get into the act as well. Soon there is a lot of deep intellectual talk about justice and law and order from people who know violence as a constant companion. Samuel L. Jackson establishes himself as the principal figure (a black man who fought for the North in the Civil War). He says he has a valid letter from President Lincoln, complementing his service. The woman is a piece of work to say the least. She is vulgar and crude and gets her bell rung on more than one occasion by her captor (played by Kurt Russell, who does quite good John Wayne vocal impression). The acting is good and we are led all over the landscape, trying to figure where this is going to go. Before we are through, we can figure on a couple of revelations.",7,0,2,29 June 2016
Catch-22," It Keeps Coming Back
","I don't know why it is. I read the book about 5 times. It was one of those rites of passage in my youth, founded in the sixties. When the movie was going to be made, I thought, 'Oh, Lord!' I didn't have to see it. I was disappointed in it before I went to it. I believe I was perceptive enough to know that there is no movie director on earth who could do justice to the book. It would be a failure. In most ways it was, at least in my eyes. The thing is, though, that every time it shows up on TV or I find my old VHS copy sitting worn on the back of a bookshelf, I can't take my eyes off it. The surreal meandering, the craziness of the signature title, are presented well enough to hang on to my reluctant attention. I think one of the things I love is Alan Arkin's expressions of pain. When he opens his parachute to find an M & M Enterprises coupon, it is laughable: 'We're going back. We're going to turn the plane around and go back.' Then the same thing becomes ugly when he looks for the morphine to help Snowden in his dying state and the same thing happens. The characters are well drawn and the acting is excellent. Every scene is a Catch-22, piled up one after the other. Meanwhile, Yossarian is dreaming and yearning and afraid to die. It's the cohesion that's missing; it's some of the really significant characters that give the insane order to the book. Still, next chance I get, I will watch it again, because, as the Doc would say after Yossarian says, 'That's some catch that catch 22.' 'Yep, it's the best there is.' For now, this is the best there is, and it will do until some other poor soul tries to do it again.",8,1,1,21 September 2001
"I, Tonya"," An Uncomfortable Telling of a Tragic Figure
","I recall how incensed I was watching the Olympics with my daughter and seeing this coarse individual skating. It was a lesson for me to realize that sometimes other factors take over our lives. It is remarkable that with those forces she was able to become one of the top skaters in the world, in this elegant sport. And yet, her minions couldn't leave well enough alone. This is a good movie, dealing with some harshness that now is presented.",9,0,1,29 April 2020
The Adventures of Tintin," Comments from the Totally Uninitiated
","I guess I went into this with very little background. I know my son owned a collection of Tin Tin comics when he was younger. I know that this is really a significant character to a great many people. Hence, like 'The Lord of the Rings' the portrayal of these figures is going to bring angry disappointment to a segment of our viewers. Personally, if we were to take away the amazing animation and substitute real people, this story would be like a hundred others I have seen. It is the Saturday Morning serial portrayal of a reluctant hero who finds himself in incredible scrapes. What bothered me is that I never really cared. When I saw Hugo (a contemporary of this film), I was able to identify with the central figure, and though he was an animated character, I still cared about what happens to him. I'm sure people will see my criticisms as unfair because this is more Indiana Jones than a subtle story strong on character development. I just never felt connected.",7,1,2,22 May 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A More Serious Movie Than We Realize Sometimes
","To start with, the two main characters are criminals. While the movie has lots of clever one-liners and sparkling roles, they are a couple bad guys in the eyes of the law. Newman and Redford sparkle on the screen, and the movie is a feast for the eyes. Katherine Ross is also a lovely addition. It starts out with the two of them stopping to see their old flame and having a real party with that 'Raindrops' tune in the background. They have just re- established themselves as the leaders of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. What follows, however, is a series of misadventures. They are under constant scrutiny by lawmen who are out for their hides. They have numerous close calls and end up in Bolivia. When they ply their trade there, they have an equal response from those authorities. There are numerous moments of comic relief, but it doesn't disguise the fact that the law will not rest. This is a fine movie, but not all fun and games with a happy ending, like 'The Sting' was.",9,1,2,8 December 2016
Moana," It's In the Telling
","This is a very well done animated feature, using Samoan culture and mythology. At some point there was an upheaval when a demi-god stole a heart, a green gem that needs to be returned properly to put an end to evil. A Samoan princess is enlisted by the ocean to go on a quest to return things to the way they were. She is forced into acting against her father's wishes, going beyond the limits he has placed on her. Of course, there are no surprises in the plot. We can parse this out without any trouble. The stars of this show are the special effects, the music, and some very interesting characters. But it doesn't offer a lot of new plot developments. If we see enough Disney films, we could line up the characters that seem to appear in just about everyone. Moana is a firecracker, but her endless talk and advice gets a little old. The best characters in the film are the Ocean (yes, the Ocean) and a hilarious walleyed chicken. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it, but I didn't find much new ground.",8,0,1,25 June 2017
Crash," Best Picture: I Don't Know
","This is a kind of intense view of racism and all its implications. What starts out as a car accident leads us into a dramatic portrayal of the worst in many of us. The problem is that it is contrived as an ensemble cast portrays these actions. The acting is good, but it is a bit simplistic and cliched. Still, it is provocative and worth the effort. The word 'crash' is a good one because it is way more than two cars striking each other. I don't think this was anywhere near the best movie of the year, and the Oscar came as quite a surprise.",8,0,0,2 May 2019
Snatch," Don't Take It Serious!
","This is a really funny movie. Obviously, the subject matter could be very serious. It is violent and decadent. Still, the interaction among its characters, from the guy who keeps losing his fingers, the three black men with the dog, to Brad Pitt and his mother, fried in her trailer. The plot is convoluted and intriguing. There are two issues: a huge diamond and boxing match that needs fixing. Sometimes when so many cooks are involved, the broth gets pretty strange. These guys are all at the top of their games, each looking over their shoulder to see when the next shoe will fall. It would be fun to see it again, knowing the relationships that developed throughout. There are delightful performances all around and we actually find some of the characters naive and rather playful. Still, money talks. it's no Pulp Fiction, but it has some real joy to spread, in a kind of sick way.",8,0,1,22 January 2010
Spider-Man: Homecoming," What Are the Rules?
","Since I'm seeing this movie as a layperson, not one at the altar of the comic book gods, I'm evaluating it from that standpoint. I've seen most of the Marvel films and have had a level of enjoyment. I love the special effects but most of all getting to know the humanity of the principles. The better the story lines the better the movie. Here, Peter Parker is kind of a clichÃ© as a teenager. Still, he is fun and a bit dense. If I have an issue, it is his over confidence at times. For one with his gifts he can be quite naive. We have numerous moments when everything could explode but he manages to escape detection. I have to say that I'm growing tired of the physical confrontations, the violent fights. When two foes can't seem to harm each other no matter what they do, it actually gets a little dull. Still, I think this film bodes well for the future. One of the better. Oh, Michael Keaton lights up the screen.",8,2,6,15 July 2017

","This, to me, ranks as the masterwork of black comedy. From the harmonies of 'When Johnny Comes Marching Home,' to Bat Guano defending the Coca Cola company as a nuclear weapon is about to bring about total annihilation, one cringes at the absurd potential realities.  I had heard of the strange title with its equally understated subtitle, but saw it for the first time in 1969.  I have watched it at least 20 times since.  There is so much.  The empty headed but patriotic Major Kong, played by Slim Pickens, is one of filmdom's most memorable characters.  The deranged open eyed, gum chewing visage of Buck Turgidson, with his military zealousness, talking about 'mine shaft gaps' (man I wish we had one of them doomsday machines!)  Jack Ripper and his precious bodily fluids.  Then, of course, there are the Peter Sellers roles--Mandrake, who has the fate of the world depending on finding enough change to make a phone call; the President who works to gain the trust of Kissoff, the Russian Premier, and, of course, the maniacal schizoid Strangelove.  This film is, I believe, Kubrick's masterpiece.  It is an integration of power and what can be done about it attitude.  It ends with a song as it began--Try a Little Tenderness,' with the sexually provocative refueling of the bomber, to 'We'll Meet Again' as the bombs explode.  This is a great film.",10,2,3,2 October 2001
MASH," Harsh and Unfair
","I agree with the reviewer who talked about what this film represents. I don't rate it as low because the subject matter of Korea was an abomination at the time. For God's sake, we just got out of World War II. Here we have an interesting situation that would have been done so much better. An Army surgical hospital near the front lines. I wonder how many films have had this as their foundation. Now we take that provocative setting and put group of cynical, hard drinking, womanizing men who sort of terrorize the entire place. They have their foils, people they don't like. One is the self righteous Robert Duvall (Frank Burns) who is merely obnoxious. What do they do? They harass him and assault him until he breaks. I know this is supposed to be humorous and that in war, bad things happen, but this is really sadistic. Sutherland and Gould are a couple of cases of arrested development. Granted, they aren't happy with their situations, but somehow they take over the camp and play cruel tricks on people.",5,2,3,21 December 2016
Pan's Labyrinth," Stop the Abuse
","An incredibly creative piece of cinema. It incorporates an amazing fantasy world with the realities of war. It gives its protagonist a way of surviving and continuing on with a life after she could have lost everything. The visuality is striking, creating a world like we've never seen. There is an amazing use of computer generated images. Everything in this film is in balance as it shifts between fantasy and the horrors of the civil war under Franco. Del Torro is a director of the first order. If you don't like him, try to realize that he takes chances and there are always naysayers out there who want to tear down that creativity. Imagine Stravinsky stopping after 'The Rite of Spring' because the Philistines who are stuck in the past couldn't give it its due or at least have some optimism.",10,1,1,8 January 2017
Alien," You Don't Want to Go There
","This is the ultimate fright fest. From the planet these junk dealers come to, to the appearance of the monster and subsequent events, this is one wild ride. First of all, there is a bleakness and an eeriness. These people are on a salvage mission, trying to bring things back to sell. They have been victimized by their own bosses. When they go down to the planet, they have not been told what lies there. There is a darkness to everything. It isn't the romantic explorer thing of a Star Trek or the use of a sophisticated starship. This is a big space barge. When the man is brought back from the surface with that thing on his face, we know that there is something coming. The scene following is one of the most startling and disgusting I've ever seen (in a positive way). The alien is a true threat, dripping corrosive venom and poison blood, terrorizing the ship, leaving one person to combat it. If there is a more claustrophobic, terrifying movie than this, I'd like to know what it is. The other Alien movies don't quite make the grade because they draw on way too much of the same thing and it seems forced.",8,1,4,22 March 2006
The Book Thief," Perhaps a Bit Too Deliberate, but Still Quite Captivating
","I recognize the criticism of this film in that it is a bit too contrived to pull at our heartstrings. First we have the poor girl in a kind of 'Secret Garden' milieu. She is taken in by a woman who appears to be a virago, whose motives seem to be to get an allowance from the government (we know this because she is furious that the little brother has died on the way) and he husband, an easy going handyman played by Geoffrey Rush. Throw in her interactions with the evils outside (she is immediately pegged a communist because of her mother's lineage) and that she is bullied because she is illiterate. There is also her connection to a young Jewish man, Hans, who is being kept in the basement. These things are integrated, along with a little blonde kid who lives next door, Rudy, who takes a shine to her. So we have some real plot weaving. That aside, the characters are nicely developed, the situation outside is one we all know, the world is collapsing and good is going out the window, there are threats everywhere. Death is an everyday occurrence as are the purges that take place. Sophie Nelisse is the wide-eyed eleven year old who seems older than her stated age. She has her guard up at first but it slowly drawn into the family, mainly from Rush's immediate affection toward her. He recognizes the pain in her, knowing that those around, including his wife, have enough pain of their own. Like all films set in Holocaust Germany, there is a visible tension that settles over the populace. News of an actual war is exciting to everyone, most of whom are so taken with the cause, they fail to realize what they are saying. I was somewhat mesmerized, even though I knew I was being manipulated. The book was breathtaking; the movie a worthwhile use of time.",8,2,3,18 January 2015
The Doors," Superb Performance...Incredible Casting
","I totally agree with several before me that at some point in the film, one forgets he is watching Val Kilmer play the late Jim Morrison. This is a marvelous performance by a gifted actor. His physical appearance and voice really capture the essence of one of the top five or six rock bands ever. There is lots of documentary footage of the doors because they came along when videotaping and filming were everywhere, so to capture a realistic display of performances in a film had too be good. We get to watch the guys slowly evolve. We get to see how Morrison held sway over the group. Ray Manzarek had an incredible talent of his own, and yet he kept being dwarfed by the charismatic lead singer. There were times when Morrison's performances were almost transcendent. The music is really good here as well.",9,1,1,5 January 2017
The Polar Express," Visually Engaging But......
","I liked the film, but I didn't love it. It is an interesting story with a real holiday message. The animation was well done. For me, I never got that sense of vulnerability among the characters. There are a lot of near misses instead of a true sense of humanity. I never felt that anyone was ever in any real danger, that this was all part of the gig. Still, the visual aspects are remarkable. The North Pole is quite a place. It appears that socialism is working well. It reminded me of May Day in the old Soviet Union. I know we aren't supposed to look at things that way, but do we have a right to wonder what the lives of these masses is like. They appear to be cut from some sort of proletarian mode, doing their things to complete the task. Do they get to experience the joys and wonders their visitors do? Anyway, the trip is delightful, the special effects are awesome, and the story is touching, thought I never knew why that little boy was so depressed. In the great Christmas epics, this character would be much more defined and not so needy (the Tiny Tim influence). This one does nothing to reveal himself other than things never go his way. It's certainly worth the trip just to see the incredible events.",7,1,2,1 January 2010
The Best Years of Our Lives," Please Make It All Right
","One can't watch this without thinking of our present coming home soldiers. Consider the rampant PTSD and all the other factors that affect the lives of these young men and women. Some are maimed and some are psychologically damaged as they try to resume their lives. This film brings a portrait of three men who have left the same war, World War II, with various handicaps. One has lost his hands in an accident, one has become bitter and dissatisfied with the treatment of his fellow military comrade, and the third goes back to his wife, who has no interest in him anymore, who is only interested in a meal ticket. We get to see how war has changed these people. The handicapped man is the most obvious, as he longs for normalcy, yet watches as his family and friends drop into a depressed state, utterly aware of his limitations. They don't mean to, but they take away his humanity. He falls into the pits of depression, almost driving away the one who loves him most. The other two wrestle with their own demons. This is beautifully presented in a subtle way, without being maudlin. Of course, Hollywood requires a sappy ending. Still, the rest of the movie, including the great Hoagie Carmichael as a piano playing bar owner, stands on its own merit. I hadn't seen this movie in nearly forty years and it was a delight.",9,6,6,14 May 2015
The Town," That Tug at Personal Morality
","I always get caught short on the idea of the glorification of someone whose life revolves around the deaths of others, whose 'occupation' is to steal from those who have no say in anything. What I mean is, our hero is not there to dole out justice or to even a score, he's a two bit punk who happens to be smoother and more handsome than the others around him. In the process, he begins to become more human because of falling into a relationship. I know that this attitude would negate 'The Godfather' or any of the wise-guy movies so popular over time. So I enjoy the development of the characters, even if I have not one scintilla of admiration for them. The ugliness of the Boston streets works well here as does the criminal element and the 'honor among thieves' thing. What works well is Affleck's brush with true humanity. One last issue. I'm getting a little tired of the incredible amount of fire-power that these guys have and how little carnage there really is. Also, there seems to be a lot of carelessness in police work if we are to believe this stuff.",7,3,4,16 February 2011
Suicide Squad," Just Too Much
","I remember as a child when Universal decided to take all the monsters (Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, the hunchback, Dracula, etc.) and have them all in the same movie. These were the worst of the series.. This is another case of too many characters, no plot, no substance. I guess it won an award for costuming but the characters demand that they be costumed to be the characters. Don't bother.",2,2,3,28 October 2019
Taxi Driver," Gut Wrenching
","It's interesting to read the reviews by people who really disliked this film. Can we dislike virtually every character in a movie and yet keep watching it, even respect it? I don't have a definitive answer to this, but I was captivated by this film. I get this feeling every time I see films that glorify organized crime. DeNiro's performance so surpasses any doubt as to the content of this film that I couldn't take my eyes off him. Contrary to the critics, his every expression reveals his skill as an actor. While his motivations are confusing, they are his motives. He is an unbalanced war survivor who can't tolerate the cesspool the world has become. I mean, 'What did I fight for?' His social skills are wasted. When he goes on the date, it's one of the most uncomfortable moments I've ever spent in a theater. The efforts to save a small part of his world is met with disdain and resistance. So he flips out and decides to clean it up himself. He is suspicious of politicians and authority figures. He becomes his own man and takes matters into his own hands. The key thing is that he is true to himself and even though he is a frightening figure, he gets his way. I guess most think he should have been killed. That's not a valid criticism. See this, but be prepared to keep changing positions in your seat.",9,4,7,22 February 2007
Shutter Island," OK, Play with My Mind!
","I was told on several occasions to skip this film. While I felt it took a long way to get to the point, I found it intriguing and engaging. I've really grown to like DeCaprio and find him to be an interesting actor. One reviewer did criticize him for hanging around the dark side a bit much, but that could be said about Nicholson and a host of others. This is one of those mind puzzles that force one to guess a good deal. Because of the pace, I eventually figured it out. Nevertheless, it is told in a very interesting way. With 'Inception' capturing the box office recently, this seems a mild effort to explore the subconscious. It is multi-layered and complex. It throws curves and red herrings, but I never felt toyed with. This is certainly worth a shot.",8,0,2,30 August 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Very Good, Considering I Jumped in at the Wrong Time
","I read comic books years ago but not for a long time. I have watched many of the Marvel films already released but don't have that foundation that the fan-boys have. My mistake was not realizing there was a previous movie when I went to this one. So it took a little information from my twenty something son to get me up to speed. I'm sure most of you reading this know the Captain America mythos. This is a high speed, action every minute, mind bending experience. The individual characters are interesting and complex. I still need to watch the first movie to actually figure out the whole 'Shield' and 'Hydra' thing and how it works and what Captain America has done. However, when you have your characters being pursued by the most formidable of villains, it isn't necessary to have an encyclopedic knowledge of all this stuff. For an old fogie, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forward to going back and watching the first one",8,0,2,25 June 2015
Capote," He Is Capote!
","I saw Truman Capote dozens of times; he was a staple of the talk show circuit. One of the greatest TV moments was when he called Wilbur Mills a racist in the most subtle way that the Georgia governor took about half a minute to realize what had happened. This man was a firebrand. He never backed down from anything, despite his effeminate ways and small stature. Unfortunately, he word his celebrity on his sleeve and was often overly harsh and full of himself. This is a great movie. The subtle methods he uses to draw out the story from the murderer shows that he would do anything to get a story, even lie to a person with whom he had begun to fall in love. He pictures himself as compassionate at times, but he is often unwilling to go that final mile. It's surprising he was in attendance at the hangings, the events that probably contributed to his death. What a complex man. His canon of American literature is small but he was a master stylist and commentator. See this movie for Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance. It is one of the greatest in cinematic history. We remember Capote. He is Capote!",10,8,8,23 April 2007
Life of Pi," Master Storytelling!
","This is the most wonderfully original movie I've seen in such a long time. It is set up with an amazing touch. We are absorbed into the Indian culture by some of the most lovely people. They are understanding of Pi's dilemmas and his religious confusion. They support him, although he is an arrogant little twit at times. There is an amazing scene where he shatters his boundaries and almost gets himself killed by the tiger who later becomes his shipmate. The special effects are probably some of the most believable and effective I have ever scene, from the shipwreck to the game of (excuse the expression) cat and mouse that ensues. We are totally involved in the incredible story of Pi and how he uses his knowledge and survival skills to maintain both his life and his sanity. The tiger, Richard Parker, is so well conceived and so believable in his own evolution that we grow to feel for him and his fate. There is a comradeship that one can only view. I found myself describing this movie to a friend, and when I finished he acted like I was crazy to have liked it. I guess Pi felt the same way. This is a movie that takes a wonderful book and an amazing story to new depths. There is also, of course, Pi's struggle with his views of a god that he can't quite define. His is an honest doubt. No character in fiction is asked for more and has to question the entity that he says as responsible for the loss of his family and his abject loneliness in the middle of the Pacific. I can't wait for this to come out on video so I can savor it again. My regret is that I didn't get to see it in 3D which I don't normally care for.",10,7,14,22 January 2013
Lost in Translation," A Quiet, Personal Film
","Being in a profession where there is constant noise, I enjoyed this movie for a very odd reason. The characters are pulling away from a hyped up society, away from a world, much of which is based on needless, trivial noise. Everywhere they go there is more numbing action. Watching the director of the commercial gyrating, trying to act like a real film director, despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial, typifies some of what this movie is about, a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine. I thought the Bill Murray character developed tremendously. While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull (money isn't everything), I believe that he began to see things he hadn't seen before. I liked that while he was struggling with his marriage, the crises were simple, day to day things that living brings to us. The young woman he meets shows through a whimsical kindness, that he is worth something. She is refreshing to look at an to be with. He, like many middle aged men, has self doubts. Because she has a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his, he should go back to his life a little more sustained.",8,3,6,8 August 2005
Tangled," Nicely Crafted Tale
","Everyone knows the story. The girl, Rapunzel, with the golden hair, kept up in a tower. She is only visited by one person who controls her. Of course, unless she were headstrong, nothing would happen in this film. And, of course, she is. Also, we know that to fulfill her dreams a guy is going to show up. This time, however, the rules get changed a bit and the formula is broken as well. I didn't gravitate toward this one as much as previous Disney films, but it was still very good. I think the title is great. I think the plot moves along at a nice pace and Rapunzel is quite interesting. Once again, the animation is superior.",8,2,2,7 September 2017
Interstellar," Intellectual, Although Sometimes Flawed Science Fiction
","I'm treading on some little used ground. From reading previous user comments, it seems that people give this movie a ten or a one (really?!). While this movie is, at times, a little confusing in the implications of time and space, it is still quite challenging and interesting. Earth is dying. Technology and war are blamed for the current conditions. Apparently, because of some serious dust, crops are slowly being destroyed. Also, the dust presents health hazards. The solution is to find a way to get people to a new place...or...to let the chips fall and send a few into space to inhabit a new planet or asteroid or moon or whatever, and start the whole thing over. A group of people who have maintained NASA (which is now seen as the deceivers of mankind) are building ships to explore the possibilities. The problem has to do with a limited time to manage this because of the laws of relativity. I thought it sort of devolved in a kind of sentimental mess, but the presentation of the problem is worth a viewing. There is some preachiness here which I find a bit hard to take, and a couple stated lessons that an eighth grader would know, let alone these experts. But it did keep my interest. One short criticism: It is way too long.",7,2,8,19 June 2015
Full Metal Jacket," Why Was He There?
","This is such an uncomfortable movie to watch. I understand what the Marines do. There is one lead fighting machine and they are it. I like to think that what is done is a lot more humane. I believe that one can be toughened without being dehumanized. The character of Pyle is singled out. It seems that if one wanted to terrorize a group of recruits, you don't just focus on the one weak link. This guy should have been shipped out. He was never going to make it. Some guys achieve strength through suffering. He continued to submit to the horrors of boot camp despite the over the top attacks on him. If I wanted to show a definition of sadism, I would use this movie. Now, I agree with a previous writer that in wartime, the carelessness of one man could cost the lives of others, and the sergeant was making a point. But was Pyle becoming a better soldier? Did he ever becomes a better soldier, or was his spirit broken almost from the beginning? There has to be something to be said for the endurance of this man and how long he lasts, even if he fails. The ending did not surprise me. I anticipated it.",9,1,1,19 April 2006
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Too Far Out!
","I'm giving this a decent grade because it kept my attention from beginning to end. The thing one shouldn't do is to think too much. McDormand's character actually gets away with murder (not in the literal sense). She does things to people, especially those who had nothing to be ashamed of, that are beyond the pale. I appreciated that Woody Harrelson's sheriff is not unsympathetic. He is a pretty good guy. He tried to solve the case, but he is right when it comes to finding no clues. By the way, is anyone reading this growing a little tired of the 'F' word being used in every other syllable of speech. The cops, townspeople, McDormand, on and on, can't say three words without dropping one of these. Is no effort made to create realistic speech among characters? Almost every police movie or movie with tough guys bends over backward to throw as much profanity around. I'm no prude, but I believe most people go through their days without this heavy artillery. I went to a supermarket yesterday, filled with all kinds of people, and didn't hear the 'F' word once. Outside of that, if one accepts the premise of this film, it's tragic to watch this woman in her state of rage and guilt. She is a victim, but has no qualms about inflicting venom on others, including children. The police are ineffectual and one, Dixon, is a caricature. He is a great caricature, but so over the top, it's hard to imagine someone like him existing.",8,0,0,3 June 2018
The Grapes of Wrath," It Could Make You a Socialist
","Steinbeck's classic comes to life. It's the dust bowl era and the depression. People are driven of their property by the banks. Of course, those banks got those people help getting that property and the depression was a complex collapse. Still, it's sad to see a portrayal of human misery. The Joads pack up everything and head west. Of course, there's the Woody Guthrie song 'If You Ain't Got the Dough Re Me.' There really isn't an easy answer. California represents the great unknown where the streets are paved with gold and there's work and land for everyone. Naturally, the whole country was wallowing in poverty, and California was pretty well overextended. There's a point where all of us would say, 'It's either me or them.' Henry Fonda who looks like Jane (or is it the other way around) is young Tom. He can't stand any more of the stuff his family must deal with. He is going to become enterprising. Unfortunately, he finds himself on the wrong side of the law. It's a group of socialists (some would call them dirty Commies) who come to the rescue with their collectivism setting things right. We see things through a filtered glass. John Ford had his own belief system. I felt good and clean when the Joads had some things look up for them, but I realize, also, that it's not so simple. Sometimes there are circumstances that don't qualify as evil--they just are. I hope that we can take a balanced view of the world and help those who need help.",9,7,14,6 April 2006
American Sniper," About What I Expected
","I didn't get around to seeing this movie because it's just not my style. But often I will watch something because of the awards and the hype and I am pleasantly surprised. 'The Hurt Locker' was an excellent film. It was riveting because I really cared about the characters and their resolve. This has some of the same issues but doesn't come close to the former film. Here we have a man whose reason for fighting has to do with what he sees on television. He is a man with little moral compass. He just would like to kill the bad guys. This whole film is so loaded with the military agenda, it makes a hero out of a guy who assaults women and children (yes, I know they carry bombs--but that's because this movie feeds us this). He goes into the houses of terrified people, begging for their lives, who don't happen to speak English. Hollywood and Clint Eastwood create a milieu where the deck is totally stacked. The domestic side of it is pure applesauce. The wife back home that he picked up in a bar. The atmosphere of violence that stays after all that this guy has seen. I was surprised at how manipulative and uninteresting the film is.",5,1,12,14 January 2016
Rocky II," The Rematch
","Apollo Creed is embarrassed by his inability to put Rocky Balboa away. As a matter of fact, he damn near lost. Now he is being jeered and maligned. It is only a matter of time before he fights the guy again. Rocky has settled down an gotten a bit lazy. It takes some fast talking from Creed to get him out of hiding. What follows is the formulaic plot that will delight the populace and satisfy our need for another result. Once again we have conflicts in Balboa's life. He is still maligned by his own manager and brother in law. But it's going to be a fight and I'm not spoiling anything by saying that they will meet and they will pound each other half to death. The second movie doesn't have the fresh charm of the first, but it's still a captivating film with enough intrigue to make it interesting.",9,2,2,22 December 2016
Lion," A Gripping Story That Could Have Been Better
","To start with, I really enjoyed the film. It impressed me, even though I already knew the whole story. That takes some doing. The story of the young boy, the first half of the film, gives us a view of the sadness that takes place because of over-population. People live on a subsistence, but somehow many manage. Of course, many do not. Saroo goes with his brother to steal coal off the trains. It is utterly dangerous with possible death around each corner. They manage to trade their coal for a couple small bags of milk which they take home. The older brother can work and Saroo is a pest. He manages to talk his brother into taking him to a new job site by train, but he gets separated and the rest is history. We see the little guy trying to figure a way to get back to his village but he can't name it or his mother's name (he calls her Mum). He manages to get away from some nasty people, probably avoiding being sold into prostitution. Through a series of events, he winds up with an Australian family which adopts him and another boy who is severely, emotionally disturbed. If someone had done a little script work to bridge a twenty-five year gap, it would have helped tremendously. We now have Saroo as a man. He has been accepted into white (and brown) society. He has an attractive girlfriend played by Rooney Mara. But he is conflicted. He hates his brother because he shows disrespect for their adoptive parents. He has also begun to long for his original home. Bits and pieces of his life before the age of five have crept into his mind. Had there been even a few minutes for us to get to know when this longing started. Also, some of the specifics of life with the second brother. A psychological framework for his feelings. There is so much angst in the older Saroo. It could have been sold better. It would have made very good film a great one and could have been done without making it too long. The little boy who played little Saroo has such an expressive face. Beautiful.",8,2,5,5 February 2017
Forrest Gump," Pure Charm
","Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film. The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten.",10,1,4,7 April 2006
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Masterful Photography!
","Starting with Eisenstein's 'Ivan the Terrible,' I began to be comfortable with these early films and their incredible focus on faces. This is like an 80 minute slide show, using some of the most wonderful expressiveness I have ever seen. I know this could be boring to some, but even in shots that seem repetitious, there are subtle differences that express the absolute summit of emotion. This story has been done so many times and it usually falls on the hopes of the character to express, usually in words, faith. Here Joan is so human and yet so saintly. She is devoted to her faith but also afraid. We need to remember that this person came from humble beginnings, unable to even read. Perhaps she was delusional. Personally, I have trouble with any of this, but she certainly could not be more heroic. When she recants her confession, she does so in the shadow of the stake. I was intrigued by the soldiers and the villagers at the end. Did this really happen? I don't recall this in other treatments though I may have forgotten. It is also wonderful that this film was restored. It is crisp and bright and needs to be to show every wrinkle of its characters.",10,2,5,26 January 2010
Gone Baby Gone," A Good Movie and a Good Book!
","The story drives me crazy because I can't help feeling for that little girl. This is a sign that the performances are really quite good. Casey Affleck plays a guy who is moral but tightly wound. His Catholic affiliations are always on the front burner. Do we as a society have a right to intervene when the parent of a child is just despicable. Is this grounds for trying to set things right. I believe what is good about both the book and the movie is that there are no simple answers and we have to, at times, deal in some absolutes. The performances here are very good and I liked that violence is not laughed off. When Affleck's character kills a man, he is haunted by the image and fear for his mortal soul. There are, of course, more questions but I am not going to throw in any spoilers. The performances are quite outstanding and touch at the heart.",9,0,0,2 January 2010
"Monsters, Inc."," Very Creative
","I had heard a lot about this before I went (which I hate), but it was still a pleasant surprise. What I loved was the workaday world of the monsters with their factory, their doors, their business, so like the corporate life of the non-monster world. The character's have gentleness, commitment, and a positive view of the world. While some of it is scary (the whole premise of monsters in the closet is scary anyway), it walks a nice line between being too saccharine and too violent. There are some great lines, and the imaginative world created and based on the scream/energy concept is quite clever. For those that take three year olds to movies, I don't know many that don't have something that would upset someone this age. This film is about monsters. They can't be too tame or they will lose their monsterness.While there are harsh things, the closing scene is done with great sympathy and on terms that we can all live with. It is also about risk taking to do the right thing. This is not Citizen Kane but it sure ain't bad.",9,0,1,28 November 2001
Ant-Man," It's Those Little Things That Count!
","Once again, there's a guy who needs to take over the world and side with a horrible group. He has money and fame and yet he has to go over to the dark side. In this case, he has taken previous research and molded it to his own devices. Michael Douglas first developed the ability to close up molecules and make things turn smaller with intense strength and capabilities. Then he loses his wife and drops from the scene. His right hand man, an ambitious jerk moves ahead and plots evil use of the findings. Paul Rudd plays a poor guy who is divorced. He was sent to prison for a burglary which had some unfair circumstances that led to unfair results. Pyn, Michael Douglas's character, realizes that he has to stop the next step or these bad guys will take over the world and brutalize it. Rudd becomes Ant-Man, not just because he can become small, but because he learns to run with the ants. Of course, the whole thing is high on the hokeyness meter, but, then, it is comic book stuff. It is fun and exciting and works pretty well. It leads to some pretty sappy results, but this is not Fellini or Bergman. It's a joyful effort, using the Marvel trademark.",8,1,3,11 February 2016
Captain America: The First Avenger," It's Good to Be Uninformed
","As I've said in the past, I go to these comic book movies with little knowledge of the foundation of work put forth over many years. I had already seen the sequel to this one and wondered what some of the schtick was about. It answered my questions. My responses are quite basic. For one thing, I love seeing Nazis get theirs and this allows that, although the guy is more than a National Socialist. The character of Captain America is quite delightful and full of sap. I love that shield. He can hit a three rail shot and take a guy's head off from fifty yards. Overall, it was fun to see how he came to be. It was great entertainment as an entire battalion troops into camp after he has saved them from imprisonment. Of course, considering the enemy firepower, one must question the lack of casualties. I'm sure I'll see the third movie. Apparently, Marvel now produces about half the big budget movies released.",6,0,2,21 July 2015
American Hustle," Conning the Con
","I would have to buy into the criticism that the people who frequent this world are so hard to praise (although the female leads are quite striking, especially Amy Adams) that it is hard to gain an affinity for them. We see a sort of Bonnie and Clyde scenario (although the violence is not there) as a couple of odd bedfellows find each other and attempt to make big bucks until an FBI agent gets involved. Their future depends on their willingness to expose corrupt politicians and mafia types. There are several twists of plot that make things interesting, but it is often hard to clearly see what the endgame is. Now you don't have wrap everything up with a ribbon, but I'm still not entirely sure what happened and to whom. There is chemistry between Christian Bale and Amy Adams who has this sultry sort of Veronica Lake thing going. I enjoyed those scenes the most. And then there is Jennifer Lawrence, the wife from hell, who chews up every line. People who say the acting is poor must be on another planet. Anyway, this was worth seeing. Perhaps some editing could have helped a bit.",7,1,4,31 January 2015
The Godfather: Part II," No More a Sequel that the Odyssey is to the Iliad
","It's only a sequel because of the Part II thing. This simply fills in the spaces with one of the greatest characters of all time. Remember, the two were put together in an incredible sage, putting things in chronological order. Talk about your psychological studies. Inside the head of Michael Corleone is a sense of power at all costs. Yet, he sees himself as a moral man. I wonder if one could look at organized criminals like one might look at a mideast country, because they have their own principalities, their own history, almost their own religion. They have parceled out their land and protect against invaders. They fear and react to threats from the outside, from 'non-family' members.The product they sell is terror. Of course, all participants live on the edge. Their human failings are dismissed and magnified as weakness and disloyalty. Brothers kill brothers. I haven't a lot to add because I am not a film expert. As uncomfortable as this film makes me (like the first one), I continue to watch. And in my heart of hearts I wonder if I were cast into this setting, could I stand up to the expectations of my culture?",10,3,4,16 February 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," The Best of All
","I decided to have a Bourne-a-thon. I had never seen these movies. I absolutely loved the first one, like the second. This one puts the pieces together. The psychology implications of Bourne's training are hinted at in the first two movies. The beauty of this is that everything is kept so tight and so tense. I think that a really good adventure film relies on villains that are more complex than one dimensional. The failings of the bad guys and their monomania are at the center of this. Because of their overreaching, they make themselves vulnerable. Bourne has been trained well because he never makes a move without a reason. That doesn't mean that his ignorance of his past doesn't get him in trouble. There are a couple times when common sense would have won out. But weight that against the odds. He also picks some honorable allies now. It had to happen. The last half hour of this film is vintage. It works on the mind and pops up one surprise after another. Watch 'em all.",9,1,3,25 January 2008
Fargo," Well I S'pose Ya Should See It, Ya Know
","Bein' a Minnesotan and havin' seen 'Fargo' (which is not in Minnesota, ya know), I want to say that we don't talk that way. No indeedy. Well that said, this review can move on ahead. I certainly liked that Frances McDormand. You know, she was constantly on the trail of those two guys (they were funny lookin'). William Macy as Jerry certainly did a good job as the auto salesman who fell on hard luck and had to have his wife kidnapped. You betcha! And that kidnapping scene where the two guys botched it was funny in a sick kinda way, considerin' they killed her and all. Yaw! Those Coen brothers. A couple of Minnesotans, ya know, can tell a pretty gory tale and make it work out. And where else would you find a wood chipper bein' a major part of a story? This movie is certainly in my top ten of all time. I hope you get to see it or whatever!",10,0,4,14 February 2006
Nightcrawler," Hard to Watch; Hard to Look Away
","Jake Gyllenhaal is the nightcrawler. A nightcrawler is a worm. Bloom, the character played here, is a sociopath. His ambitions and fixations far outweigh common morality. Let's face it, his cohorts in the business aren't much better than he is, but they have a kind of code, and they don't participate in enhancing the crime. When Bloom moves an accident victim for the first time in order to get a better shot, he crosses the line and stays on the other side. He is willing to do anything to get his way and he is a master at monotonous monologue when he is confronted. It's as if he is reading from a book. I heard an interview recently with Gyllenhaal and he recited some of this stuff from memory with almost no emotion. This is a terrific performance by one of our really good actors. The way he is able to slide into every situation unscathed and maintain that sardonic grin is really nonpareil. This is about the voyeurism of the audience which demands this hateful kind of portrayal.",9,1,2,4 August 2015
The Aviator," Slow Pace at Times; Still Remarkable
","I think Scorsese wanted us to see the full Hughes package. He wanted us to get inside the head of one of the most remarkable tragic figures in history. Since most of Hughe's demons appeared later, the inventiveness and risk taking billionaire (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) dominates the screen. He is a pile driver and gets his way. It makes you wonder if this man had been poor early in life, what would have been the result? This film captures him in his ups and downs. Through all it, however, is the undercurrent that is put to us in the opening scene, that the world is dirty and we need to be protected from it. Howard begins his compulsive behavior at this early age, the seeds of destruction planted by an over protective mother. Along the way we meet Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner (his equal in arrogance), Faith Domergue ('This Island Earth'), and other Hollywood stars (Errol Flynn and Carol Lombard). The movie is a circus. It is fraught with big scenes and painful scenes. I have trouble with biopics because they often are based on one man's view of things (Oliver Stone, for example), but I had a sense that Scorsese had done his homework and was able to keep to the more public Hughes.",9,0,1,13 September 2010
Bohemian Rhapsody," Excellent Performance, Giving Us a Picture of a Great Talent
","I finally watched this film. The critics were a little hard on it, but it's awfully hard to divorce yourself from the incredible talent of Freddie Mercury. Yes, it is pretty contrived, which, unfortunately is the fate of the biopic. From the beginning the character was larger than life. We did get a bit into the recording industry stuff, but I'm not quite sure how much of the pain was put forth. Also, Freddie's recognition of his gayness had to have been hinted at a but earlier. But the music was so good and it makes me want to check out some videos of Queen in concert. By the way, did the Mike Meyers character actually say that Bohemian Rhapsody will never be sung by people in a car? This was a bit much.",8,1,1,7 July 2019
Burn After Reading," They Had It Coming!
","One thing you can bank on with the Coens is that the undeserving still can be bumped off. These are not morality plays. Sometimes the good guys end up slumped in some corner with bullets in their respective heads. Sometimes a person who is inconsequential and likable also ends up in the same place. The thing with these guys is that there is always a strain of unique humor running through the movie. In this case everyone is either moronic, amoral, or stupid. A lot of mistakes are made through misinformation and too quick action. This is the way it is. John Malcovich gets the ball rolling by losing his job (or quitting it). Because he has been a high roller at the State Department, his innocent and inferior memoirs are picked up by a health club trainer (Pitt) who can't think five steps ahead. And then there is the Francis McDormand character who is trying to reinvent herself but needs a bundle of money to get liposuction. The funniest, to me, are the people at the top at the State Department who are watching this maniacal feast and simply let things happen because they don't have a clue what to do. There are three incredibly funny scenes where the lead man has the events explained to him. At one point he tells them not to notify the FBI and instead burn the body. This is a precious little movie. Once again, I left satisfied with a Coen product.",8,4,7,30 August 2010
Watchmen," Comments from an Old Guy
","This kind of movie is one that I would normally ignore. My tastes don't go to these big budget special effects things, but it was available and I had heard my son talk about it. It took me a while to get the idea. I don't read graphic novels and so I had to educate myself concerning the characters. Over time I began to realize that this is a telling of history as if it had gone a different direction during the Nixon era. The world changed and not for the better. Superheroes who could only help on a limited basis have been kept from their task and retired into relative obscurity. Everything picks up when a character called the Comedian is killed (and that takes some doing). I was really impressed by the world created and by how these figures (who are really multi-dimensional) start to interact. There are both cosmic and societal forces that are linked and the governments of the big countries have no idea what is going on. That includes Nixon and Kissinger who are odd to look at, especially with that putty ski jump nose of Nixon's. All in all, it works very well and has a lot of suspense and a very satisfying conclusion. At first I thought it was way too long, but I soon came to realize that the complexities of the social milieu and the number of characters, as well as the need to use flashback to show us where these people had been in the past, made it necessary. While it is incredibly violent and unsettling, it's worth the effort.",8,1,6,3 November 2009
The Bourne Identity," Underplayed is Good
","I enjoyed this. It had been one of those movies I had heard about but had never gotten around to. There are times when it seems that Matt Damon is such a cold fish (ala The Good Shepherd), that one has trouble getting connected to him. In this film he is really believable as a man who has all the training of a killing machine, but a soft side that bears exploring. The character is put into situations he can't understand but can only react to. He has compassion but little understanding. What an interesting role. If there's a shortcoming, it's that the motivations of the bad folks aren't all that clear. It's still a delight to watch his relationship with his I-only- need-a-ride partner develop. There is a level of subtlety that most films of this type don't have. The car chases are spectacular but, for once, they backed down on the pyrotechnics. I appreciated this.",8,2,2,25 January 2008
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I Don't Know if They Could Do It Much Better
","I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion.",10,2,3,2 March 2006
Man of Steel," How Could They Do this to Superman?!?!
","As usual, I find that for some when a movie is made about a super-hero, it has to fit into some pigeonhole, determined by years of comic books. God forbid that someone tries to find a different angle or a new approach. As usual, there is all this nit-picking about details that don't seem real. For heaven's sake, the guy can fly, comes as a baby from another planet, and can go back and forth in time. Let's check the reality thing right now. There have been so many reviews of this that I doubt I can contribute much that is new, but for me, the guy was a multi-dimensional character who has to deal with a hand that is dealt to him. I'm waiting for Superman XIX, 'Superman on the Psychiatrist's Couch.' The guy must have incredible angst during his private moments and feel the weight of the world. Anyway, the acting is quite good, there is lots of action, and under the circumstances, he seems pretty real.",8,4,5,3 January 2014
Grease," Some Really Fun Songs
","John Travolta is coming off his Vinnie Barbarino persona. He mugs for the camera. He plays the dummy too often. He is totally a child of peer pressure. I end up thinking, I don't really give a damn if the two of them ever get together. Does anyone else care. The movie is lightweight, but it never takes itself seriously anyway. It's a series of really great songs and interactions, primarily among the hoodlum element of the fifties (who seem to be the standard bearers of that time, even though most kids weren't part of that culture). The movie rides along on its production numbers which put forth the things that kids thought important at the time. There's the fear of pregnancy. The fear of being an outcast. The cars. The primping and showing off. The worst thing of all--being labeled a good person. The adults are even bigger buffoons. And the fact that an older Frankie Avalon shows up, doesn't quite work. These guys are dying off now so they probably will have to start casting people to play them as characters. Anyway, if I pick up this movie, I fast forward to about ten places that I totally enjoy and ignore the plot (I guess there is a plot somewhere, but it doesn't matter). I was surprised that Travolta is a pretty decent singer.",7,2,4,25 April 2006
The Caine Mutiny," MacMurray as a Bad Guy
","The beauty of this film is that there is no black and white. Bogart's Queeg should have been relieved of duty before because of his unpredictable emotions. He is mostly correct about the ship. They have been fortunate to function well under a liaises faire commander. Queeg is blood and guts and tries to push his agenda on the crew. They are not great sailors because they begin to undermine his authority, yet are self righteous about their motives. The incident with the strawberries is nutty enough; Queeg on the verge of a nervous breakdown. But, of course, command decisions later are the real reason for the mutiny. The men know they must do something and mutiny followed by a trial occurs. When the chips are down, MacMurray gets going. He is the wise guy who embraced the mutiny until the trial began to go badly. Queeg is pathetic at this point, but his service record is worthy of respect. Great movie.",9,1,3,6 December 2016
Cast Away," Counteracting Loneliness
","So much has been written about the performance of Tom Hanks. He is so convincing that for a while I actually thought this had happened to him. This is a story of loneliness. The Robinson Crusoe aspect is slowly developed as Hanks employs what knowledge he has to do the rudimentary things that are required to survive. Crusoe has Friday; Hanks has Wilson. The despair that develops as one begins to realize that he may die, never seeing another human being or experiencing some tenderness, is so disturbing. When Hanks walks around, arms in the air, announcing to the world that he has made fire, it's a primitive conquest that seems so grand yet so minuscule. The final scene in the film is so gut wrenching. No man is an island but a part of a greater universe. I'm not speaking from a religious foundation but that which is within us.",9,3,4,16 January 2015
The Thing," It Never Lets Up
","I don't know if I could ever watch this film again. It's one of those where, once you get involved, you sit on the edge of your seat, feeling everything that befalls these poor men. If one wanted to create a hell on earth, this would be it. From the Norwegians chasing that dog, to a minute by minute effort to survive and save civilization from this horror. The special effects dealing with the aliens transformation are stunning, especially when one realizes it was 1982 and the CGI stuff was really barely a thought. We care about the characters but are not let in on anything, so when something jumps, we jump with it. If there is a criticism, there is no release from the tension. Even if one is able to relax for a minute or two, there is an atmosphere of threat over everyone. When you can't trust the person you've known much of your life, who works next to you, when he becomes a deadly beast, what can you do? This is one of the greatest horror films ever.",9,3,7,10 March 2017
The Revenant," Mostly Gut Wrenching but Also, a Bit Simplistic
","I just finished reading a series of commentaries by people giving this movie a single star. Take your hatred elsewhere. If you didn't like the film, fine, but because it got hype, it's not your job to lower its rating; it's your obligation to say something intelligent about the filmmaking. This is one of the most visually striking features I've ever seen. The camera angles and the framing of the scenes is spectacular. During the first scene ambush, we get to see what it must be like to suddenly be in the middle of a maelstrom. Arrows are frequently seen as sterile in most films. Here, we get a taste of them being a kid of artillery. LIke 'Deliverence,' which is another unsettling film, these guys are just in the wrong place. Whether those furs were worth a lot or not, all their work wasn't worth it. Yet, from what we hear, they are people who are the dregs of society and need something to keep them going. Yes, when DeCaprio shows up, we began to see men who, despite their oaths, will look after their own butts. Honor only goes so far in this universe. The story of Hugh Glass is part of history. I, like many others, question the extent to which this guy is pushed to the limits (a lot of Hollywood gimmickry). It takes some real skill to deal with real historical figures. I doubt that a third of this happened. I do know that Hugh Glass was mauled by a bear and that he literally crawled across three states to get revenge. Had he been totally fictional, we would be much more forgiving. In this case, less would have been more, with some compactness and restraint. I will leave it to the experts to get at the technical stuff. This is a highly entertaining film. Anyone that gives it one star is just being spiteful. I suppose they don't like DeCaprio. One even criticized the fact that it took place in the early 1800's.",8,4,6,28 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Interesting, but Often Dull Baseball Movie
","Clint Eastwood plays a curmudgeon. Hasn't he been doing this for about a decade now. I'm not saying he is bad at it (Grand Torino, for example), but it would seem that the quiet spaghetti western guy, the stranger in town, is perpetually ticked off. He has also taken on the role of the guy who won't let anyone in on his demons. He breaks things, yells profanities, intimidates, not in the cool way he used to, but because of inner pain. Still he is pretty good. My problem with this is as a baseball movie. It is pretty much about scouting and the intricacies of that profession. Eastwood has been a top scout but is taking abuse from the young guys with the computer printouts and databases who think they can see into the soul of a player much better than he. Because of his snarky being, his daughter, who has become a top drawer corporate lawyer shows up to take care of him. She is really doing him a favor because he is nothing but horrible to her. Of course, he is covering up all kinds of issues. He lives in fear that his macular degeneration will bring an end to the one thing he lives for: scouting young players. We also have Justin Timberlake, playing a scout for the Boston Red Sox and who was signed by Eastwood. He blew his arm out and has taken this job. He develops a relationship with Eastwood's daughter and this complicates things somewhat.The problem with this is that the plot and direction are so pat and romantic. Despite the gnarly scout, everything is kind of schmaltzy. The camera work is over the top in a sort of National Geographic way. There are lots of contrived shots for effect. John Goodman who is really a 'good man' in this is fun to watch, but even he is a bit much. I'm very picky about baseball movies and this one left me a bit uninspired.",7,0,0,6 August 2013
Bridge of Spies," Insider Trading
","It's always a bit dangerous to do historical drama, especially when things are within the memories of living people. This is the story of a prisoner exchange involving a Russian spy and U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, whose spy plane was shot down by said Russians. Instead of a series of scenes of weapons fire and close calls, this is a very cerebral movie. Tom Hanks, in sort of an Atticus Finch mode, puts aside the furor of the nation and potential threats to his family, to follow the course of justice. He finds himself dealing with those who must cater to their nations positions in world politics. He also must act without sanction from his own country. Next to Hanks, Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel steals much of the movie. I'm sure some liberties were taken with facts along the way to make it more Hollywood, but this did nothing to diminish a real view of what the Cold War was like. And, yes, I remember 'Duck and cover!'",9,8,17,19 October 2015
Cold Mountain," The Slender Thread
","I've always reacted against the ugliness of war. The politicians who send others to fight for them, sitting back, pontificating about the justice of battle. This is a slice of life story where two people are victims of forces they can only hope to avoid. Having read the book and knowing how it ended (no spoilers here), I sat back and watched what went on, seeing how certain figures were presented. Renee Zelwigger as Ruby, of course, dominates every scene she is in. She takes it all on. She is equipped to survive where others are not. I would like to find out if there really were groups of raiders who sought out deserters. I sometimes wonder if people knew half the time who was actually in a battalion, let alone sending out warrants on them. Were people pursued like Jude Law was? I need to find a Civil War scholar. The movie is episodic, like a modern day Odyssey. Every obstacle just leads to a more overwhelming one. Was there no kindness? Were all betrayers? Anyway, I felt a great sense of having been in a fight at the conclusion of this film. See it for its intensity and its life. Some of the acting is a bit wooden, but the course is rough and the way hard. That's what the film is all about.",9,2,4,7 December 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Plenty of Nuts in This Tree
","This is such an offbeat piece of work I don't know where to start. I think the Miss Sunshine part tells us that no matter what a mess life may seem, there is a ray of sunshine. This is a story about a group of the most diverse and often dysfunctional characters ever put on a screen. The point of the story is to get to a beauty/talent pageant across country. The positive energy put forth by little Abigail Breslin is astonishing. We know from the start that the little waif with her big glasses isn't going to outshine all those little beauty queens with their overbearing mothers and thousands of dollars for dental work and hair styling. But the movie is about the journey and the love that develops along the way. When push comes to shove it is the 'weird' who seem the most normal and the Normal who seem 'weird.' Alan Arkin is great in his brief appearance. The profane munching that goes on among the characters is precious. Underlying their schizophrenic rants is true love.",9,2,3,22 May 2012
North by Northwest," Suspense from Beginning to End
","There is something comforting about a Hitchcock film.  We know that no matter how serious the events are, there is a wonderfully complex plot, comic relief, and great actors to pull it all off.  The spoiled, inebriated Roger Thornhill, like so many of the master's everymen, finds himself thrust into a world he must escape, while, at the same time, trying to figure it all out.  His arrogance is what gets him deeper and deeper into trouble, but it is also what saves him.  Cary Grant is the only actor I could think of who is so suave and yet so combative and self centered.  As he realizes what is happening he must constantly face death, while being manipulated by the powers that be. He is being set up, he knows, but by whom?  Enter Eva Marie Saint, but knowing Hitchcock, she is to be watched carefully as well. Most of Hitchcock's 'victims' reach a point where they won't take any more.  I love the way Thornhill has been put in a predicament where he has no confederates and must remain underground.  Everyone back home thinks he is the irresponsible drunk he truly is.  Even his mother isn't to surprised to find out he may be a murderer.  The use of settings around Rapid City, Mount Rushmore, all the Hitchcock signatures, make this one of the best, if not the best, if all his films.",10,0,1,5 May 1999
Knowing," You Gotta Finish Strong
","I'm afraid I have to side with those who found this really disappointing. As I watched the first two-thirds of this film I was really engaged. The premise is really fun. Cage is at his quirky best as he tries to juggle his obsession with his life, one that requires an equal share of attention. A brilliant man, he breaks through the puzzle left behind in the time capsule by the little girl. Unfortunately, the script fails us. Once again there are children who can hear voices and mysterious figures lurking in the woods. Once again, we have a religious kind of resolution. When this happens, what was a scientific movie with Cage breaking through becomes another one of those 'We are so small, we can't understand movies. There are also red herrings all over the place. What's the deal with those rocks other than to make us ask, 'What's the deal with those rocks?' After I saw '2001: A Space Odyssey' and read 'Childhood's End' by Arthur C. Clarke, I've gotten the message. These are outstanding works of art. This new movie begins wonderfully and then becomes another rip-off of the same old same old.",6,1,3,23 September 2009
Hugo," Captivatingly Sentimental in the Best Sense
","I found this to be incredibly engaging. I don't know where some of the venom is coming from. When people decide what a movie is supposed to be before they see it, aren't they setting themselves up for disappointment. Also, it would seem that it also shows a lack of much imagination. I found the character of Hugo to be incredibly complex and diverse. He does have a quest. It's to get answers to questions that have defined his life. He meets wonderful characters as they slide through the masterfully created milieu of the train station. There are forces out there that could send him off to the most dismal of existences. This has all the charm of the best children's books that I seen when I go to the library. The artistry is there. I suppose if you are expecting Narnia with a bunch of pseudo-religious manifestations, you will certainly be disappointed. This is like saying that you didn't like Gone With the Wind because there were no space aliens. Also, it gave life to a mystical figure, George Melies. I remember seeing that spaceship hit the moon in the eye and thinking how rapidly the artists adapted to the invention of film. I would hope you would not be put off by the nay-sayers. This is a neatly crafted cinematic experience from beginning to end.",9,4,6,22 May 2012
Doctor Zhivago," Baby, It's Cold Outside!
","This is a film like no other. Set in a period of great strife in a place of cold violence and indifference. This is a love story and a story of revolution. This is a portrayal of what is worst in humankind and what is best. We have a love story that transcends the elements and carries on to future generations. These are excellent performances by Julie Christie and Omar Shariff and impeccable direction by David Lean, who has produced some of the greatest works of the cinema. As we travel the endless vistas of the Soviet landscape we are given a taste of the Russia of the time, but there is threat at every turn. The young Yuri is shown the ugliness of politics at an early age and must confront this throughout his life. He is a man of great courage and compassion. If you've never seen this, by all means do so.",10,1,2,8 December 2016
U-571," Boy, were these guys lucky
","I don't know. When you get the message that a submarine can only withstand so much pressure, you know darn well that it's going to exceed it. Can you imagine if the sub had been crushed like the egg when it first encountered its maximum stress. They must have dropped 500 depth charges but the darned thing just wouldn't give in. Then we have the torpedo fired like a dying gunfighter as he breathes his last going right on target; and was that some torpedo. With torpedoes like that, I'm surprised we needed to drop a bomb on Hiroshima. One of those would have erased Japan from the map.I know I'm nit-picking because I know we need to suspend a little disbelief here, but there is a claim of authenticity that just doesn't work. The other thing that bugged me. Why didn't the guy (the one who gets the 'You can do it' pep talk) use a rope or a hook of some kind to pull on the lever.Why did he have to use a fully extended arm. Also, why did they let that German prisoner live and sabotage things for so lon. They had no trouble blowing away the rest of them. My guess is that the director needed to throw another obstacle and show how devious the enemy could be. Well, you get the point. This is one of those films where I started with a reasonably high opinion and as I thought about it, realized how poorly constructed it was. I liked the acting.",6,1,3,15 August 2001
The Shining," Very Good; But Could Have Been Great
","I always try hard not to compare media. Unfortunately, I had read the King novel just before seeing the movie. There are plot elements that could have been included that would have made this a much better movie. One of the things is 'the shining' itself, the supernatural abilities of the young boy. The character of Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is used up with virtually no effect on the plot. I don't know why King allowed that to happen, because it weakens so badly the chance of the victims to escape. The topiary could have been used to a better advantage as well. The way things are, it is too one sided. That being said, I think the Nicholson role is awesome. This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. It has enough shadows and manipulation of the supernatural to really be frightening. I loved when Jack was telling the man who hires him what a great opportunity this was for him to work. He's about as wolfy and sly as he can be. Of course, when he finally gets there, the hotel takes over and he begins to become that wolf. One of the most terrifying moments in all of film is when Shelly Duvall , the wife, picks up all the pages he has typed and they are just gibberish. Kubrick plays with us in grand style. I saw the movie a few years after my first viewing, and because the book was behind me, I enjoyed it a great deal more, even though I knew the events unfolding. Kubrick seldom disappoints and this is no exception.",9,1,2,19 April 2006
"I, Robot"," Just Like a Hundred Other Movies
","It's just blah. A bunch of reproduced computer animated glistening robots. Will Smith, whom I really like, just a caricature, doing his talky thing. The movie lacks any charm. I know that a big battle is going on between those who are fans of the book and the movie. As long as they stole the title of the book, maybe there is an obligation to use some semblance of the laws of robotics. This is like most of the science fiction coming out these days. It's some guy trying to buck the establishment (the new Enron or whatever), who has to get to the bottom of things. He gets beaten up and barely escapes with his life several times along the way. Why couldn't someone with a lick of cleverness, build in a kind of means of circumventing or explaining the behavior based on the laws that Asimov set up. It doesn't mean that he or she would have had to copy the plots; just play by the rules. But then you would have to have the wherewithall to use a brain and come up with a plot that would fit. This is simple entertainment. I'm amazed that it did that well at the box office. I guess Hollywood has a good grasp of the lowest common denominator.",6,0,0,20 April 2006
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," So Much More Than I Expected!
","So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, 'This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman.' But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith.",10,0,1,19 November 2019
American Beauty," Obsessions can be deadly
","Ahh, the joys of middle age. I remember a day at work, when a customer referred to an old gray haired guy who had waited on him. I didn't know who he was talking about; then it dawned on me; he was talking about me. Middle aged men, like Kevin Spacey, do have these fantasies from time to time. The girl in question is so unapproachable and so unconquerable, it should never have been an issue. In the meantime, we have the guy next door, with the hangups and his sexual identity issues. It's a sick mix. It's intriguing, but who would want to be there? Of course, marriages begin to fall apart, people begin to try to be what they are not, and the dominoes start to tumble with great dispatch. Someone is going to get hurt; someone may even die. Like Gene Wilder in 'The Woman in Red' if our lives ended right now, it may be worth it. Unfortunately, tomorrow is another day. What were we thinking? Is this bravery or foolishness or madness or hormones or what? The sense of betrayal that filters through everything puts a pall over the ether. The acting is excellent. This movie is so intense and so absorbing, you can't take your eyes off it, like a traffic accident. I don't feel better for having seen it, but it's a sign of our time in life.",8,1,2,30 March 2006
Judgment at Nuremberg," Nothing Simple About Justice
","Spencer Tracy is at his best in this film. It is a post World War II trial of four judges who made decisions during the reign of Hitler. We get a look at the causes of the German people's allegiance to the horrible tyrant. We get to see why the decisions made by the judges were not so simple and we get a sense of their humanity. We don't get a simplistic presentation of them as monsters. They were men who were forced to make decisions that may not be moral but which put country first. There is a real sense that we are the flies on the walls of Spencer Tracy's office. He is determined to make the correct decision and decide whether these men should be executed. Their crimes are pretty black and white. The screenplay is remarkable. It took into account the realities of the time and the aftermath of the German people. One thing to remember is that after the war, the people themselves were forward thinking. Remarkable performances by Tracy and, particularly by Burt Lancaster.",10,1,3,8 December 2016
Duck Soup," Simply the Best
","When you can take the insanity of war and put it out there with all that is the Marx Brothers, you have 'Duck Soup.' Many wars are about feelings of impotence. They are about world leaders striking out against others. Take these posturing idiots and substitute Groucho and you can see the utter ridiculousness of some wars. One should watch this movie and then take a look at what goes on in Washington every day. The wisecracking, honking, malapropistic mess leads to confrontations. We even have a president right now who would be at home with the Marx Brothers. He and Chico could debate, using words we've not heard before. As a movie, this is hilarious. Like most of the boys' movies there are constant distractions, puns, posturing, and insanity. The mirror scene is astonishing and has been copied so many times. And, of course, Margaret Dumont (who apparently never got the jokes) is there for Groucho to antagonize. Take the time to review the Marx Brothers canon. There are a couple clinkers, but this, along with 'Animal Crackers' and 'A Night at the Opera' are not just funny. They are among the best moves ever made.",10,1,2,16 February 2007
Apocalypse Now," Take the long ride to perdition.
","There are films we watch because they are good, even though they are painful for us. This is a film I saw one time. At that time I thought to myself, this is enough. It was painful to make that journey down the river, wondering what was around every corner. Then we meet the products of our own id impulses, as we are the enemy, our souls have been brought down to this. At the end of the river is the man who came before us, and we see the uselessness of the journey. It is the Heart of Darkness. There are death masters like Robert Duvall. There are those who can only hope to survive, but the war is the master. The Doors music as the napalm settles gently on the treetops and across the ground, sweeps us up gently. Meanwhile it is consuming the flesh of the Vietnamese people, as well as an occasional American soldier. The ancient Romans could not envision peace without war. We and much of the world seem to have embraced those tenets put forth some two thousand years ago. This film gets into the marrow.",9,0,1,12 February 2007
The Battle of Algiers," Much Like Today
","As this film unfolds, we have a sense that things are happening before our very eyes. The movie is so documentary-like as to seem like a stationary camera has been set up in the midst of turmoil. The French imperialists are the reason all this is happening. Obviously, years of 'rule' make the day to day existence hard to change. Do all the Algerians want an overthrow of French rule? Probably not. Maybe not even a majority. As the rebels blow up restaurants and airport waiting rooms, the police are torturing the rebels. It becomes a cesspool of the lowest form of human degradation. And yet, what else can be the answer when a single entity has such a foothold and ultimate military power. As is usually the case, attrition does the job. With our current situation in the Mideast and Afghanistan, will we find ourselves reproducing what happened to the Russians? Unfortunately, there are no easy answers because the fight is against oppression. The kicker is that there is so much human and economic expense involved in these situations that often it takes centuries. We need to ask ourselves what is gained and one cannot put a price on the human soul. This is a masterpiece of movie-making should be seen by any who think revolutions are clean and the enemy is easy to define.",10,1,2,16 March 2010
The Patriot," How Mel Won the War
","When one sees these blockbusters, full of CinemaScope-like battle scenes, colors, graphic decapitations, the first impression is that there must be something here. I disagree with people who say it shouldn't be criticized because it's a movie and doesn't promise to be American history. No movie is an accurate portrayal of American history. They do however, within the world of the film, present accuracies and verisimilitude. This one is again a monster movie. The personification of evil, Satan himself, is British, and heartless. He locks people up in a church and burns them alive. He has no regard for anything--they are as flies to little boys--they kill them for their sport. Not only that, he's impenetrable, he's yet another thing that can't be killed. Thank God Mel Gibson is around. Unfortunately, by the time he gets into the action, there's not much left. The battle scenes are breathtaking; the scope of the movie phenomenal. Can't someone take this and do a Saving Private Ryan or Paths of Glory. Instead, we end up with the supernatural villain who can only be killed if he faces the Gibber, who personifies Popeye when he says, 'That's all I can stands, cuz I can't stands no more!' I didn't make it to the theater to see this. I'm sure visually it is more grand than my big screen TV. A little subtlety, using characters we care about, people with hearts and souls, and, yes, a little bit of reality about what the American Revolution was about. As it stands now, we have shown that the great Patriots and Revolutionaries didn't win the war--An Australian Did! Aren't they part of the British Empire?",4,2,4,17 September 2001
Edward Scissorhands," We Hate What We Can't Understand
","This has all the wonderful qualities of true fantasy. It is a story that becomes timeless of an artificial creature who is unfinished by his creator. Edward would have been like a human if his maker had not passed away. He ends up with sharp scissors instead of hands. Because he is quite docile and mute, he is taken in by a family and loved. But his strange being causes others to reject and vilify him. Whenever anything happens concerning his hands, it is immediately assumed that he had evil intent. Johnny Depp plays Edward with a true sensitivity that resounds in the film. He becomes a love interest for one character. This part of humanity is beyond his thought processes. Others want to be rid of him although one wonders what sort of threat he offers. Everything eventually comes to a head when the world seems to turn against him and he returns to the place of his 'birth.' This is an outstanding, original film.",9,1,1,29 December 2016
Silver Linings Playbook," Life Is a Lot More Complicated/A Psychiatrist's Buffet
","I have to agree that Jennifer Lawrence is darn good in this. Bradley Cooper overacts with the best of them. But as I watched it unfold, I just couldn't buy into it. Of course, this is ultimately a comedy, though it is a dark comedy. Cooper is completely out of control when he is off his meds. This is pretty well presented at the beginning as he rants about getting back together with his wife (after having nearly beaten her lover to death). His strained relation with his father, a bookie/Philadelphia Eagles Fan/and a raving OCDer, is in the forefront. The dad, played by Robert DiNiro is about as off his trolley as Cooper. The mom wants everything to be nice, and is constantly caught in the middle of these 'crazy' people. DeNiro has been banned from the Eagles' stadium because of rowdy behavior in the past and believes his not being present is the reason for their lack of success. Anyway, Cooper hooks up with Jennifer Lawrence who is newly widowed. She is also a nut case. She becomes his mother confessor and his link to getting back together with his wife. She is learning to dance and insists on his helping her with this in exchange for her participation in getting messages to his ex (there is a restraining order that keeps him from her as well as the high school where she teaches). Lost in all this is the seriousness of bipolar disorder. All the people in the movie are in serious trouble, and when the chips are down, the writer and director back off and turn it into a bit of a silly romantic comedy. Cooper is unrecognizable in the second half. Where did all the angst and despair go? These people don't have epiphanies. They are in constant battle with their disease. While it captivated me on one level, I felt it sold out and became less that it could have been.",7,0,0,3 July 2013
Van Helsing," Endless and Pointless
","We are constantly being reminded that we can't understand movies if we are not into cgi (computer generated images). Well, that doesn't work for me. That's like saying a black light Elvis picture is true art because I don't appreciate black felt. Movies are good because they have a story to tell, not because they are endless eye candy. The convoluted nature of this film, taking every random horror element possible, just doesn't work. This is too bad. I think Hugh Jackman is a really charismatic actor. It's just that they throw so much against the wall to see what sticks. Maybe if, like video games, the movie came with a manual, explaining the rules that each character can play by, it would be helpful. Some can die; oops, I guess they can't. Some can fly; oops, I guess not. How do you kill those already dead? I am a big fan of the classic horror genre. When I saw the trailer to this at another film, I was really excited. I thought maybe a young Van Helsing would be a little more cerebral. He is just kind of a supernatural bounty hunter who goes on and on and on. Where does he find the energy. Personally I like the guy with the thick glasses who is not afraid to look into the eyes of Lugosi's Dracula and tell him off. 'There are things worse than death, Mr. Van Helsing!' Dracula says. Maybe this movie is one of them.",3,0,1,21 March 2006
The White Ribbon," Bleak and Disturbing
","It will take me a long time to get this film out of my brain. We are brought into a community where a baron runs things, almost the entire village affected by his whims. He lives with his young wife and children. She hates it there and the kids are accepted grudgingly by their peers. In the village are a harsh Protestant minister, a schoolteacher, a doctor, and other figures of fierce authority, plus quite a group of children who have lived in oppressive conditions. We are mad privy to the humorless village where no one smiles and where common people live in fear of the future. Religion is presented as a venomous and ugly thing. The minister's children are routinely beaten and humiliated for their 'sins' including an awful diatribe on the results of masturbation (sores, mental illness, and death). The boy is forced to sleep with his hands tied to the sides of the bed. It becomes likely that all this oppression is going to ultimately lead to some pretty bad results. Visually, this film is striking in its utter blackness.",10,0,2,16 January 2016
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Will They Continue the Series?
","I know the first thing I'm supposed to do is to compare the original with this American remake. To be quite honest, I don't really see much to justify the remake. Of course, we aren't asked to read subtitles. The character of Lisbeth is a bit more harsh in the latter film. But I didn't really get much new information in the second film. It is obviously more polished and more skillfully produced, but that isn't always the best. I enjoyed a bit of the darkness of the original. The bad guys are just as bad. The rape scene is more graphic. I am also curious to see if Daniel Craig or the other principal characters are interested in moving things along. For whatever reason, I am really taken with the entire story but feel satisfied that the story has been already been told. I always enjoy another angle, another interpretation, so I'm hoping that they do decide to add to the opus.",8,1,5,25 May 2012
Dreamgirls," The Music Speaks for It
","Dream Girls is the story of the Supremes. Obviously, that is implied. I didn't have high expectations for this. I saw the Broadway show years ago. The movie is more slick and the music carries the show. Eddie Murphy deserved the Oscar. There are some pretty sure things that function well here, but as a story, like with most musicals, we know how it ends.",8,0,1,3 May 2019
In the Name of the Father," Superb Acting and an Outstanding Story
","What is so sad is that while some of the true events were played with, for the most part, this sad episode in British history actually took place. The issue of Northern Ireland has spawned numerous portrayals, some of them outstanding movies. This is about a man who is a bit of a buffoon and a free spirit who acts foolishly (unfortunately, he is unaware that his stupidity would be viewed as it it), and gets into big trouble. Not just going to prison himself but dragging in his entire family. New laws allowed a group of overzealous police to take the rights of a 'free' people into their own hands. It's a bit like the Homeland Security act today. It was easy to torture, frighten, and taunt people into giving up everything. This included threatening to kill a good friend or even your father. This is a black eye. I never felt the IRA had a right to do what they did, but one can see how their hatred was hatched. Add to this the incredible performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and his cohorts and you have a superb film. See this one.",10,1,3,29 December 2010
Being John Malkovich," What the Heck?
","It is wonderful when a movie comes out that sets new parameters. This is so far fetched, yet so ingratiating, I loved it. There are so many things that struck me that I can't begin to list them all. To start with the crazy living conditions of John Cusack and Cameron Diaz (almost unrecognizable). Cusack is the morose puppeteer who puts all of his angst into his shows, making them most unpalatable. He is frequently struck by people on the street for doing things like Heloise and Abelard in a sexually suggestive manner. Then there's the office complex on the floor between floors which brings every sight gag imaginable. I could go on and will leave the real reviews to others. I just want to recommend this to anyone who wants to see a movie that on the surface sounds ridiculous, but will have you hurting afterward. Malkovich gives his best performance playing a caricature of himself and showing himself to be a great sport.",9,0,1,8 January 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Quite a Piece of Work, Though a Bit Manipulative
","I haven't seen any of the other MI episodes, so I went into this cold. Some friends chose this movie. I was very surprised. I know that the technical aspects of these films is phenomenal and there are going to be gratuitous chase scenes and weapons firing non- stop. Also, since it is Mission Impossible, an impossible situation arises and not only must they fight the bad guy(s), they are considered the bad guys. Alec Baldwin weights in with his power hungry smugness and makes a great foil for Cruise and the gang. Obviously, a good deal of the film is about trust and dependence on your colleagues, and at times we are thrown enough red herrings to feed a Norwegian convention. Once can't, of course, get too critical, because there are so many events that depend on the most incredible fortune to come together. That motorcycle chase is marvelous, but so dangerous that the entire house could have crumbled in a second. Anyway, I look forward to retracing the 'canon.'",8,1,5,19 August 2015
Spider-Man," It's Got Magic
","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting.",9,2,3,28 February 2006
Jarhead," The Harsh Reality
","The old war movies are so simple. Our heroes are eventually going to meet that adversary and finish the issue. This is a film about the boredom, the alienation, the disconnectedness that takes place in wartime. The men in this film are hung out to dry in the desert. Remember the first gulf war was fought mostly with high tech weapons and bombing runs. Of course, there were ground casualties and close fighting in some places, but this film is more about the tension that develops when those with their fingers on the triggers are made to stand down. I think the most gripping part of the film is when the oil fields are burning a and sludgy rain of oil ash and black particles rain from the sky. These guys suffocate on this. It's like a plague from the Bible. All they can do is trudge through it. There is much more to this film, but the bottom line is what the heck is the enemy and what do we poor soldiers have to do to confront it? The answer in this case is to wait and see.",8,1,1,11 October 2010
Dunkirk," Just Never Grabbed Me
","I would concur with many that the film was overhyped. Nevertheless, to give something as breathtaking in its cinematic efforts a one or two is ridiculous. I guess people who are into war film are not unlike the fanboys in the Marvel world. This is an intense film. I'll admit that if I had to depend on it to explain the actual events of the Dunkirk rescue, I would say it was lacking. It's no 'Tora Tora Tora' or 'The Longest Day' which depict the breadth of the subject of war. It focuses more on fragile individuals who are more realistic. One reviewer referred to two of the men as cowards, doing whatever they could to stay alive. As if those who were trapped by the Germans wouldn't do whatever they could to stay alive. Yes, there is a bit of tackiness. These are fictional characters. There's lots of heroism to go around. There is cowardice. This is war and war is not desirable. Still, with a big picture attempt it would have been much better.",6,4,5,25 February 2018
The Machinist," Yes, It Is Dostoevsky
","This is such an unpleasant film to watch. Christian Bale brutalized himself for the role, needing to lose so much weight. It's about a man who is beset by guilt and is unable to sleep. I was astonished by the fact that three previous viewers mentioned Raskalnikov from 'Crime and Punishment.' Bales' character is beset with paranoia and lives life, thinking that everyone is trying to do him in. He has a terrible time with relationships. But there is something that happened in the past that he is carrying around. He finds a woman who is willing to have a relationship with him, even though she's a prostitute, but he messes that up. We watch him self destruct and try to fend off threats, but he is his own worst enemy. Very good film.",8,0,2,9 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A Dark and Impressive Film
","Harry is maturing and becoming more and more involved in that past that has brought him here. Sirius Black becomes the spoken adversary, but his presence is a bit obvious and we moviegoers are a suspicious lot. The three compadres begin to work together in more productive ways, moving the action rather than being moved by it. Hermione begins to become more flesh and blood here and deports herself well. Harry is now dealing with the horror of the potential end of his life and must make his way, discovering clues along the way, knowing that everything isn't always as it seems. Hagred and his hippogriff are pretty cool in this one and the unraveling of the plot with those spooky wraiths guarding Hogwarts is really captivating. There are a few rules that could bear some explanation. I've not read the books and would probably benefit from an occasional explanation. I'm ready for the fourth installment.",9,1,3,3 August 2015
Ratatouille," Among the Greatest Animated Features
","The absolutely absurd premise of a rat becoming a great French chef is brought to fruition by Pixar. It starts by being amazingly colorful and capturing the world of food. Secondly, it is downright funny but does not insult the intelligence of the viewers. Food becomes the background for everything and as the tiny rodent gains popularity, we are pulling for him. This is such an intelligent film and it works at every level.",10,4,5,4 May 2019
The Lego Movie," Certainly the Perfect Vehicle for a Children's Movie
","The nice thing about Legos is that they can be anything. They have the plastic malleability to become structures, characters, villains; you name it. Of course, just about every movie for kids is about saving the earth or the universe. This is a non-stop fountain of the primary colors that keeps going. The strength isn't so much in the plot but in the multiple way the Legos can be used to show emotions and true 'humanity.' There is some romance and some brinkmanship, but ultimately it gets down to true creativity. The universe is truly the Lego board and if you or your kids have ever played together, you know the overwhelming possibilities. There are some pretty good songs in here but, I must admit, they have become pretty tiresome.",9,0,1,22 July 2015
Aliens," A Masterpiece of Suspense
","This is a fantastic film in every respect. While the original was outstanding, this takes it to new heights. Everything is set up so well. The bad guys in the futuristic corporate world are at it again. They know of the horrors but see people as cannon fodder for the the venomous aliens. Ripley's character is mature and smart. Throw in the little colonist and a group of overzealous (and frightened) Marines and you have the ingredients for one of the best. The story is extremely well plotted. Every single thing that is put in front of us serves a purpose later in the film. The byplay among characters and the actions of the shortsighted bureaucrat all work. The combat scenes with the aliens are intense and frightening. The work in the first movie is drawn on to create this second one. It isn't the slipshod sequel, made to make a few bucks on a previously successful movie. The aliens have now become a silly franchise. This was the real thing. Don't bother with the other stuff.",10,2,3,31 August 2010
Dallas Buyers Club," Couldn't Take My Eyes Off It
","From the opening scene, watching Matthew McConaughey show his chops as the emaciated rodeo cowboy who finds out he has AIDS, I couldn't take my eyes away from this movie. Of course, it's not because it's fun to watch. The development of his character as he parades his homophobia to where he is made to realize what gay people face every day, particular in a historical context at the height of the epidemic that shook the world. There is a personal and a social justice issue portrayed here. The villains here are the federal agencies. Unfortunately, Hollywood does tend to single out someone or something to direct it disdain. In reality, when faced with this epidemic, there was a lot of confusion as to how to treat it and while it is sad that they stood in the way of approval of some drugs, they really did have a job to do. Desperate people do desperate things. But oversight really was necessary. That said, it doesn't matter. McConaughey's performance, along with that of Jared Leto, make this one of the most intensely character driven movies I've ever seen.",10,1,1,31 March 2014
The Exorcist," Don't take it too personally
","I had great anxiety going to this film because I had heard so much about it. I was somewhat justified. I don't know when I've felt quite as uncomfortable in a movie theater. The interesting thing was that I didn't buy into any of the supernatural elements in it. I don't personally believe in a Dante like hell where devils take over our souls and can spin their heads around and burn us for eternity. Yet, the makeup on this young girl, the use of the most base profanity, the special effects, that rumbling voice, hissing, the fog, masterful. The crude, sacrilegious displays were really over the top. This is a truly frightening experience from beginning to end. The first time I saw the face of Regan, I nearly left the theater. Then my curiosity was piqued by images of ancient horrors. I am not squeamish when it comes to movies. I was ready for the vomit. But I guess I have to ask myself, 'How much can you put up with?' I know I will never watch this movie again. Once is enough. Am I cheating myself. I don't think so. But it is quite an experience.",9,3,5,4 April 2006
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Superb, Even for Those of Us Who Are a Little in the Dark
","I've seen them all because my son and I like to go to these big movies. Every time one comes out, I've forgotten who's who and what's what. This is of a different generation. What I see here is masterful storytelling, dynamic characters whose purpose isn't just to beat to a pulp or incinerate their opponents, but a culture that has developed around mutations at war with the people for whom they are saviors. Time travel can be quite touchy and this needs to be treated with kid gloves. The story begins in the present where things have gone badly for the recurring characters and their ilk. A race of killer robots has been launched against them and it becomes necessary for them to find a way to mutate time in order to prevent the killing of a man who has used the DNA a of Mystique to create these devils. Wolverine is chosen to go back because he is the one most capable of withstanding the perils of the trip. He must get a group the mutants to act on faith since they have no idea who he is. So much has been written, so what I will say that what follows is an amazing series of scenes filled with tension, humor, and clever intricacies of plot. There is a scene where a football stadium is uprooted and brought down around the White House (Nixon's White House) and used a prison enclosure. I will leave the long dramatic explanations of events to others. I really enjoyed this film.",10,4,10,30 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Who Are All These Guys?
","My son informed me tonight that the reason I was confused by this film is that a missed a previous Avengers movie. I try to enjoy these comic book movies and am always astonished how personally people take them. In this one, we are treated to so many characters with different skills and agendas that it is hard to know who to pull for, who is lugging around guilt, and who some of them even are. I was told there is character development. I don't see it. The milieu into which these persons are thrust seems to be so tilted that they really need to keep working. Lets face it. If there are casualties when they ply their individual trades, imagine the carnage without them. Of course, I had all I could do to figure out which side they are on. I guess 'Civil War' means that they are fighting among themselves in their own universe. What are the motivations? My son also informed me that there are at least a dozen or more superhero films coming out in the next two years. Good God! I love a plot where a villain has created some malevolent thing that only special powers can stop. It would be nice if there weren't a tidal wave of superheroes.",6,3,8,25 October 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Sometimes a Bit Hard to Know The Foundation of Good and Evil
","I really enjoyed watching this film. It is visually astounding with some amazing creatures which inhabit a world that is familiar to us, New York of the 1920's. Eddie Redmain comes to the big city from London to find a weird creature. It is quite destructive and his task is difficult because laws have been passed against magic. There are several factions in the city, the strength of whom is difficult to pinpoint. We have no trouble realizing who the heroes are, but the infighting within the administration is not totally clear (although I'm probably too inept to get it the first time). There is a delicate balance between the edgy, dire blackness of Harry Potter and its humor. Some of the creatures are hilarious, but when push comes to shove, there is nothing funny about what is happening. Lives are being lost and religious fanatics are seizing power. Life in the city is crippled by poverty and despair. I understand there are several films yet to be made that bank on the unanswered questions in this one. I am hoping to watch this again to get more of an understanding of it. Oh! The special effects are beyond belief.",9,2,7,21 November 2016
American History X," So Mind Bending
","Sometimes it's hard, as a viewer, to even watch something like this. It is inundated with scenes of horror and violence. If one simply passes off the idea of doing a movie about the ugliest side of humanity and then put it in our laps. The performances are outstanding and a moral commitment is made. Some would say to the worst of the worst, there is a glorification of the events through flashback that may be seen as sort of cool. This is a small price for me to pay, but I have to admit, I would not do well with a continuous diet of such darkness.",10,1,1,18 February 2019
Pearl Harbor," It May Be Long, but at Least It's Dull
","About one third of the way through this mess, my daughter left her friends and came to me for some money to go to the concession stand. I asked her if they were selling pillows there. This is one of the longest movies I have ever sat through (at least that's what my back tells me). It has some of the worst writing I have ever heard. The set-up and the romantic intrigues are predictable and uninteresting. There is absolutely no suspense. The whole plot is contrived. Oh, yes, there is an endless attack by the Japanese, but by the time it happened, my mind was wandering. As far as those tragic lovers, I thought I was watching a bunch of eighth grade girls and boys ticked off because she said he said she said, whatever!! Then, of course, we have Jimmy Doolittle, going on his raid to make up for what those guys did to us. What a slap in the face to the real event. How can a director with 135 million dollars make the attack on Pearl Harbor dull. Yes, it probably looked like that. Those bombers and fighters moving clandestinely in on the island--destroying the fleet with no conscience. What about a script? What about the building of some sort of momentum? How about focusing on the realistic politics of the time and seeing the world from both sides. I was so disappointed in this film. People wonder why it's so expensive to go to the movies these days. It's because the studios are footing the bill for this kind of bilge!",6,2,3,28 November 2001
The Usual Suspects," I'm Glad I Finally Got a Chance to See It
","I don't know what the problem is. I had heard that this is an incomprehensible film. That when it ends we don't know what exactly happened. I thought that throughout the film we were in the loop, and even if we have an unreliable narrator, I suspected that from the start. Anyway, it's been a long time since I've been taken for such a joyride with such interesting characters, even if they are murderers and felons. The plot is woven so delicately and the threat is so interesting, that I was involved from the first minute. I always wondered how Kevin Spacey, a rather ordinary looking guy with a receding hairline, got to be so well known. Obviously, this is the reason. His performance is right on and he dominates the screen, even though he is a 'gimp.' There are so many layers in this film, but I don't think the screenwriter ever plays unfairly with it and it is quite satisfying.",9,62,73,8 December 2009
Inside Out," An Intriguing View of Emotions
","As is often the case, before I could see this film, I had a host of people tell me how it affected them. Tears, creativity, uniquely presented emotions. This always shades the stuff I feel personally. While it didn't speak to me as much as others, I have to admit that it was enjoyable and highly creative. We have as our protagonist, Riley, a little girl who has been fawned on her whole life. She is happy like all kids with a few bumps along the way, as well as typical behavior. We find out that she has been formed by a set of emotions who take on an anthropomorphic being. The five of them create her personality. Unfortunately for her, the family moves from its idyllic setting in Minnesota to San Francisco, where everything is indeed different. During this time, the five emotions become unsettled and this becomes a kind of adventure tale. Joy and Sadness get shot out of their control center, and while they are finding their ways back, Riley begins to fall apart. The strength of this animated film has to do with all aspects of consciousness, such the area of creativity and art where the characters are turned into Picasso figures and later two dimensional figures. There is also the 'Train' of consciousness, as well as some Freudian stuff to work with. Memories are save on little orbs and are at the center of putting a person back together again. An imaginary friend is brought in as well. This is quite adult at times, showing things that the kids just won't get. Well worth the time to see it. Oh, I know it's been said before. Stop giving movies ones unless they are deserving. Your job is to review, not to vilify things that aren't perfect. A one should be used to evaluate a cheap 1950's horror movie or an exploitation film, not a thoughtful animated feature that has charmed the vast majority of viewers.",7,10,34,19 July 2015
Yesterday," Charmed by It
","I enjoyed this because I didn't think too much. If this were science fiction, which in some ways it was, and the Beatles never existed, how would so many things that were their legacy have developed. The British invasion would never have happened without them and a culture that expanded decades would never have taken place. But we can put that aside because the film tells us that the Beatles did not exist. Not that the four persons did not exist, but the band itself. I loved the bit with John Lennon where Mark David Chapman never came into his life. Anyway, it is a sappy love story in many ways, but the music is fun and the challenges of the protagonist are quite real in that milieu. I have been a huge fan of the Beatles from the get-go and if given a piece of paper and a pencil, could write the titles of a couple hundred songs. But to remember the lyrics, especially to a level of creative expertise, would be astonishing. Every once in a while something comes along that is just fun--no more criticism.",9,5,9,21 July 2019
Gone with the Wind," The Magnificence of 1939
","I waited many years to see this. When it was restored, I saw it on the wide screen. I've become a bit jaded over the years, and it was hard to put aside my prejudices and look at it in a fresh light. It is a huge undertaking. When one looks at the year it was made, one would say 'astounding.' There are battle scenes, fires, big houses, romances, Scarlett, Rhett. So many of these are such a part of Americana, I found myself anticipating famous quotes and scenes. I never felt much empathy for Scarlett or for Rhett. There is a chemistry that can't be explained rationally. There's that incredible score that swells and moves and makes what would be much less magnificent into true events. The acting is a bit over the top at times. People are often caricatures. One needs to overlook that racism or you can't watch this movie. I think it is a valid observation to say 'look when this was done.' It is, after all, the Civil War, and it does take place in the South. I think as a film fan, we need to see the canon of films that impressed the world, even something like 'Birth of a Nation.' If they offend at times, we should know about them and be fair to them.",8,0,2,16 February 2007
Alien vs. Predator," Just a Tiresome Spectacle
","OK. We've got these two movie entities: Aliens and Predators. What would happen if they faced off against each other. This sounds like something Cliff Klaven and Norm Peterson would discuss as they swilled beers at Cheers. A bunch of rich guys decide it is necessary to investigate some heat coming out of the ground in Antarctica. They spend a whole bunch of money to see what's there. They also hand pick a group of disparate characters to investigate. It is the usual assemblage of clashing personalities. They are also terribly short sighted and pretty incompetent. Of course, once the Aliens and Predators arrive on the scene, the humans become things to be killed. Those bad boys begin to do their things based on their particular properties and then...it's over, I guess. This is just another case of lack of imagination and an anything-for-a-buck mentality.",5,0,0,11 January 2017
No Country for Old Men," How Much Violence Can You Handle?
","This film grabs you and doesn't let go. There is so much tension and so much pain and so much death. I can think of a more despicable villain in my movie viewing past. This is a stretch for me because I am really tired of gratuitous violence. The scenes here are so graphic and fast paced, deaths of innocents and perhaps, the deserving. I guess I should read the book for some insights. The grim reaper is around the corner and he has an air compressor not a scythe. I'm curious to see what other things Bardem has done. He is certainly a presence. Of all the scenes that will stay with me, the one at the hole in the wall gas station when the first coin is flipped is the most intense. There has been so much commentary. All I can say is it was like watching an accident; you can't take your eyes off it.",9,2,3,12 January 2010
District 9," A Sociological Sci Fi Thriller
","I have to admit I was sucked in by the TV commercials for this movie. I wasn't disappointed. It didn't take long to link the events of this film with the realities of many parts of our world. The aliens are the oppressed, and, realistically, the earthlings have interned them in camps and allowed them to create a dystopic society. They feast and are feasted upon by the exploiters. Like the Native-Americans and many other disenfranchised creatures, they have become a nuisance, and the society that is treating them so badly is now going to move them to a 'more convenient' place. An overzealous public official, the central figure in the movie, gets his jollies by treating the aliens as if they were non-sentient creatures. He does a Steve Irwin kind of commentary as he invades their homes and tries to get them to agree to their relocation. He is so cocky that he doesn't realize that swipe from one these beings could cut him in half. In his stupid recklessness, he infects himself with an alien canister and begins to transform into one of them. The strength of this movie, however, is the 'humanity' of the aliens. They have personalities. They are not bugs, though they look like them. They love, they fight, they survive in horrid conditions. This is a very complex movie that doesn't go for the cheap thrill, although it does occasionally go too much to the special effects and predictable battle scenes.",9,2,7,25 August 2009
Mamma Mia!," A Big Ball of Fluff
","I would never have watched this because I'm no big ABBA fan. But my daughter talked me into it. She's a nice kid so I kept an open mind. I have to admit to trying to figure out how they managed to dredge a plot out of a mash-up of those songs. They did and they didn't. I know this has been a huge hit on Broadway and it has toured for a couple decades. Those companies probably were successful because they were talented Broadway, second team singers and dancers. Which means they were quite good. This film is mostly made up of recognizable, non-singing stars or stars that can sing in the shower but not very well. Anyway, the plot is absolutely lame, the acting is at best tiresome, and the production numbers are not all that creative. I'm giving it a 6 because my daughter might read this at some time.",6,2,3,8 January 2017
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," A Mile a Minute
","After reading some of the previous reviews, I wonder what it takes to engage the modern viewer. It seems we have become so jaded that we see the necessity of giving a one star review to something as phenomenal as this film is. It is filled with action, sets of remarkable creativity, amazing characters, in a complex plot that made me long for the conclusion. I know it doesn't follow the book religiously. Get over that. Even a fifteen hour miniseries based on a novel fails miserably. Of course, every English teacher on the planet knows that we are working in two entirely different mediums. Books and movies are different! What Peter Jackson has done is taken the primary plot and allowed his script writers to take what is given and supplement it with their own creativity. The first film, though imperfect, does set the stage for this superior second effort. What we get is nonstop action, moving the characters toward the object of their quest. Tolkien's rules are followed if not the letter of the plot. The first film was criticized for being too talky. Now this one is being criticized for not being talky enough. For me, the scene where the gang must escape an elven prison and face the orcs is one of the most delightful fifteen minutes I've ever spent in a movie theater. I don't expect an action film based on a book with voluminous characters to have character development like 'Driving Miss Daisy.' See the film for what it is and count yourselves lucky to have the luxury of being able to see the amazing accomplishments of the Peter Jackson's of the world.",8,8,11,7 January 2014
Remember the Titans," Not a Slam Dunk
","Racial prejudice is the pariah of our society. It permeates every avenue to making the world a fair place to live. It's not just American society either. It's in the North, the South, and everywhere overseas. Prejudice is counterproductive and ugly. This movie sort of pretends to rise above it. It's a feel good movie in some respects. While racism is at the center of the film, the answers are just a little too pat. It's just a little too easy. Granted, it's just a movie, but I wish it got a little more down and dirty. A trip to a training camp out of town and a lecture on the Gettysburg battlefield just wouldn't do it. Some of these kids are going to hold onto stuff their parents have driven into them a lot longer than this. Now all that said, I still enjoyed the film. The characterizations of Coach Boone and Coach Yoast are well drawn. They are both good men who love their players. They are both excellent role models. And the players and the game scenes are believable (although I am getting tired of every hit on the field sounding like a Buick hitting a concrete wall--this is happening in most football movies). The growth of Gary and the Rev is nicely done and we hope that it really happened that way. I enjoyed the two white guys who just kind of matter of factly walked into practice--Sunshine and Louis--who just wanted to play football. There are some kids out there who don't think about race very much. They are pretty naive, but they are charming. I loved when Louis hugged Coach Boone and told him he was going to college. That's a nice touch. I could go on, but others have said so much already. It's a good action movie with nice human characters. It just gets a little simplistic at times and it needs to answer for that.",8,12,25,27 February 2006
Batman Begins," By far the most intense of them all
","I've seen all the Batman movies. Most aren't that deeply lodged in my memory. I know that the scene stealers in most of them are the villains. This movie puts it on the strong shoulders of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The movie is about him and his ghosts and his baggage. It is about a man coming to grips with immense guilt. It goes into great detail to explain to us how Batman came to be. It has verisimilitude. The bad guys are, of course, really exaggerated in their evil plans. Everything is neatly plotted. There is fragility in both the character of Wayne and the city he and his family loved. Organized crime abounds and he must face it pretty much alone. I was quite impressed with Inspector Gordon (Gary Oldmann). He was believable and fragile, yet committed to what was right amidst a culture of evil (even on the police force). Like is so often the case, I can't speak for the people who know these comics so well that they fall into depression when a movie doesn't follow their dictates; yet, I really was involved in this. This is quite an all star cast with excellent direction with a bleakness that Tim Burton also did well. I think it was one of last year's best films.",9,1,2,5 June 2006
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," I Thought It Was a Lot of Fun/Could be Hobbit Forming
","There seems to be an element out there that are afraid that IMDb is going to rank a movie too high. That it is their duty to give films low scores, rather than an honest appraisal. This has something to do with keeping the 'Fanboys' in line. We don't want to be dictated to by people who are really involved in these kinds of movies. This seems juvenile and dishonest. If we weren't so jaded by the ability to produce special effects beyond our previous imaginations, would we be so cynical. The story is the story. The characters are the characters. Don't criticize Bilbo because he went on the quest, betraying his comfort level. That's what happened in the story. If you want to be critical, look at the elements of film making. I agree that the beginning is quite slow. It takes way too long to get things running. But once they begin the quest, they begin to face off with some incredibly amazing adversaries. If you read the book, you don't see a lot of character development. Gandalf and Bilbo are interesting, but it is in the classic tradition of courtly love. We don't really get to know the Knights of the Round Table either because it is their feats that are the thing of legend. They have a quest and they face off against the unknown, armed only with legend. The result is a series of amazing tasks going to the nth degree. I thought this was quite remarkable and look forward to the next installment.",9,1,3,25 July 2013
Saving Private Ryan," Horrors of War
","There's violence and there's violence. With the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie, I'm hard pressed to add much. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression 'cannon fodder' so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like. Like Schindler's List on the Holocaust, this should be a training film on war.",8,0,3,24 January 2000
The Pianist," Tour de Force
","There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see.",10,1,3,10 September 2009
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Off the Wall Delightful
","It's so nice to have a movie that is knock-down drag-out hilarious. From the beginning foray, telling us about how the hotel came to be, all of its history, and the introduction of the cast of characters, the delightful episodic delivery, it reminded me to some extent of those spectacular comedies of the sixties and seventies: 'The Great Race' and 'It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.' What transpires is Ralph Fiennes' feast for the camera and a story of great love, pain, and intensity. What works well is that there is a balance between a serious dramatic line running through a serious story that is inundated with sight gags and wonderful bits. The prison break will live with me forever, the little hammers and chisels smuggled into the prison inside boxes of strawberry torts. The quirky people from Jeff Goldblum to Willem Dafoe to the irrepressible Adrian Brody. So much has already been written about this but I wanted to get my two cents worth. One reviewer talked about it not making any money. If that's the case it means that a whole bunch of viewers have passed up a gem.",9,3,11,31 March 2014
The Favourite," No Masterpiece, But Thought Provoking
","As usual, a movie that doesn't follow conventional rules, that has no aliens or superheroes, get maligned. The worst of the year? I don't think so. It was solidly cast, interesting, and while it isn't everyone's cup of tea, it embraced a period that caused me to look further. I know it didn't have a single admirable character But, it was a harsh time when rules we follow don't apply. The Royals looked out only for themselves and this certainly came through (by the way, check on the relationship between Mary and Elizabeth). Anyway, I doubt I'd ever watch it again, but it was interesting to have seen it.",6,1,2,2 May 2019
Revolutionary Road," Another Trip on the Titanic!
","I read this novel in college. It was absolutely biting then and I have kept it with me for over 30 years. The movie is so painful to watch. I remember the fifties and their sterility and the roles people were expected to play. A few years had past since the end of the war and people were happy just to be bored. April (Kate Winslet) is ahead of her time. We know this because the talk she talks is stunning to the neighbors. He plans to embrace bohemianism make most around her think she is crazy. DeCaprio tries hard but thinks she is also nuts. There is so much angst in each scene. Some of the people who have found fault with this film are judging these people with criteria based on contemporary life. It was so much duller then and so were the people. They chose to be dull. This sets up a powder keg. The 'Wheelers,' rolling forward, have the respect and admiration of all those around them. He is handsome; she is stunning. They have two beautiful kids. His job is tiresome, but he apparently makes a little money, enough so he wouldn't have to work for six months if they went to Paris. The best scenes are when the realtor who sold them the house on Revolutionary Road (certainly an ironic title because nothing revolutionary happens) brings her bipolar (perhaps) son to visit. He is the real spokesman for the movie. The crazy guy who really knows what is going on. Anyway, this film cuts to the heart, showing people who have failed to but heads with the realities of their time. The acting is quite good though it is really hard to like either of the characters much. Silence is another main character. It's like a grim reaper when it appears.",8,0,1,25 January 2010
Foxcatcher," What the Hell Am I Doing Here?
","John du Pont has more money than he knows what to do with. He is a miserable man who has spent his life trying to be something he can never be. He is pathetic as an athlete, so he brings in a man who suffers from an inferiority complex despite his earning a gold medal in the Olympics. Mark Schultz should have the world by the butt but he is caught in an aimless quest to earn enough to survive. His brother Dave, who has also been an Olympic champion, has gone on with his life. His love and affection for his brother keep the poor guy going, but it also overshadows him. DuPont decides to create a wrestling club and enlist the help of Mark Schultz and pretty soon the poor schmuck becomes his right hand man. Steve Carell is brilliant as the schizophrenic du Pont who imagines himself the savior of the country. He believe he is a real wrestling coach, even though he knows very little (he is able to look good because he gives huge sums of money to his stable of athletes). Carell's sickness pervades the entire picture as the men he commands begin to see his irrationality for what it is. There is also the classic Freudian stuff. This movie makes one uncomfortable from the get-go and yet we can't take our eyes off the sick man.",8,1,1,12 July 2015
28 Days Later...," Scattered
","There are so many films that are like this one. The problem with many is the rules being played by. For me it was how the virus was spread, once the zombies were roaming around. In such a short period of time, how did so much knowledge come forward? And the guy who ran the military compound. How did he put together such an operation in that short time frame? There is lots of action but the chances of the good guys pulling all this off seem quite unlikely. They all end up together and manipulate the horrors, getting them to play off one another. I went into a state of detachment and let the thing cook.",6,0,0,18 December 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," A Great Character! A lot of Camels!
","I missed this film when it came out fifty years ago. I was just a kid. I've seen portions of it on TCM at times. I finally got a copy and saw it. It is is a wonderful story of one the most interesting figures in history. It is intelligent and exciting and frustrating. I began by accepting the verisimilitude of this film. I then watched the incredible effort put forth by Lawrence as he barged his British rear end into the affairs of the Arabs to meet and defeat the Turks. For me, the politics were the most interesting. The British Empire with its pack of windbags, bringing the world to its knees. We speak of the Nazis. What about the way the British treated the Bedouin populations in the name of imperialism. Still, as a snapshot of the strange landscape of social expansion, this movie is wonderful I found Lawrence's character utterly insufferable at times, his arrogance and insensitivity; but, by the same token, he was great to watch. I wish I'd had a chance to see this on the big screen. One issue I would take is that there is an awful lot of time following camels running across the desert. With a bit of cutting, I don't think much would have been lost.",10,0,2,22 January 2010
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Good Sequel, but Lacking the Wonder of the First
","The first thing I think of when I hear 'Lost World' is the Wallace Beery silent film where a dinosaur is brought to New York City. It is a Sauropod of some kind (which looks like it's made out of clay) which was not a carnivore, but no one really knew about these creatures, so they bought into it. This has the same basic premise in that it seems that it would be marketable (like in King Kong) to bring a dinosaur to the States. Unfortunately, these creatures are not lap dogs, let loose in the back yard. As is always the case in these kinds of movies, the security arrangements are totally inadequate. Eventually, San Diego becomes a breakfast buffet. Yes, there are lots of action sequences and the dinosaurs are magnificent, but it doesn't lack the storytelling that the original had. The science is not an issue; chaos theory is not an issue. This is a monster movie, much like the wonderful 'Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.' It's about destruction and death and devastation. So it out-Godzillas Godzilla with better buildings, but the plot's the same. Still, it's non-stop adventure.",8,6,23,30 December 2016
It Follows," Remember 'Night of the Demon'
","The idea of passing a curse from one person to another brings to mind the M. R. James short story, 'Casting the Runes' which was later made into an excellent horror movie called 'Curse of the Demon.' In it, the cursed had to pass on a piece of paper with archaic runes and it had to be accepted willingly by the new victim. In this take on the theme, one gains the curse by having sex with the cursed. They are then 'followed' by evil entities that only they can see. The movie starts with a girl leaving her house in her nightie, taking off in her car, and sitting on a beach, making one last call to her parents. We then see her mutilated body. The principle character, a pretty young girl, has a relationship with a strange young man. One night, they have sex, and afterward, he chloroforms her and binds her up. He then warns her that he has passed the curse on to her. This sets all kinds of stuff in motion. It is an enjoyable horror movie, given the premise, but there are some plot holes dealing with oversight for these kids and the craziness that surrounds them. They seem to move through their world freely. Also, an event at a swimming pool and its motivation are a little contrived, considering their lack of knowledge. Still, it does a great job of presenting constant psychological threat as the young woman tries to free herself.",7,4,6,8 January 2016
City of God," Almost Too Much to Watch
","One must step back from an absolute sense of repugnance at the violence and look at what the filmmaker has done in this movie. Once you tune yourself into the lives of this cast of characters and their ongoing effort to stay alive and maintain dominance, you can reflect on the amazing cinematography and overall effect of the film. There is an ebb and floe that we watch, almost a dance in the slums of Rio. There is so much poverty that factions have grown up and the people are continually victimized by them as are there individual members. The police are perpetually on the take, so a military state is eventually set up. The main character is a participant early on and then an observer. His photographic skills are his ticket out and his ticket in. There is death and destruction, drugs and murder around every corner. Perhaps the scariest thing are a group of young boys called the Runts who are making a seamless transition into the horrors of the place, keeping things going for yet another generation. I think the most dominant theme of the whole thing has to do with the indifference toward death. Even those who are friends early on will kill their friends because a drug lord says so. It's an unforgettable film.",9,2,4,24 November 2009
Cars," That's 'Mater' Without the Tow
","This is just a load of animated fun. Our dearest possessions, our cars, are made anthropomorphic, and take on the personalities of their functions. The old tow truck, voiced by Larry the Cable Guy, is my favorite character, and he functions as the voice of the drawling hick. The sports car is reckless and unpredictable. Of course, vehicles of law enforcement have their own way of acting as well. So the creators have put together an entire subculture where these vehicles are the stars. It sounds silly until we begin to be engaged in their roles. There are protagonists, antagonists, characters of comic relief, just like any movie, animated or not. Pixar has masterfully connected what would have been flat animated images and brought them to life. I'm not much of a car fancier, but this one still got me. There's adventure, romance, and a race. What else could we want?",8,0,0,9 January 2017
The Little Mermaid," Nice Story/Great Music
","This is a masterwork for Disney Studios. The story alone would be enough to carry this. We have great undersea characters whose level of knowledge is restricted to their environment, naturally. We have a nasty villain, Ursula, who is jealous and pained by her own appearance and awful voice. We have a longing for something that is not easily understood by the other characters. Take a really neat plot and throw in some amazing songs. I mean Broadway songs. Animation has become its own Broadway with very little tweaking. Ariel is a fully developed character with wants and needs. She is a strong 'woman.' One may find the need for a man a bit sexist at times, but it is more of a longing. We then have a willingness to give up everything (her voice in particular) to experience what it would be like to be a woman. Looking back on this film, we see the die is cast for success after success with some of the best pop music ever written.",9,0,0,1 December 2016
Django Unchained," It's Like a Day at the Slaughterhouse
","I'm pretty broad in my tastes in movies. I've seen most of Tarantino. When I start watching, I know that peoples arteries will be pumped up to 250 pounds per inch. I haven't seen so many geysers since I was last at Yellowstone. I was taken in by the story. The establishment that there is evil out there and yes, there was racism in the old West. And I did enjoy the avenging angel. But when the gore started and it sounded like the lake washing up on the shore at midnight, I slipped away. I really didn't care what happened to these guys. This is just another one of those blood baths that have no end. Two hours and thirty minutes of it. They mistreated your wife. Let's kill everybody. Of course, they are all simplistically portrayed as consummate evil. Only Django and his guy are acceptable. And anyone else who is black, unless, of course, he's in it with the white guys. There are some things to recommend this. The cinematography rivals the National Geographic as they make their way through some of the most beautiful places on earth. The white house at the end of a path that looks strangely sexual is a good touch. The argument among the Klan members about the holes in their masks it hilarious. I know he is trying to pull our chain at every step and it is fun to see the bad guys get theirs. It's so excessive.I think what frightens me is what kind of culture have we become where this kind of movie brings people in in droves.",7,1,4,10 August 2013
Get Out," Had Me on the Edge of My Seat
","This is no perfect movie, but it shouldn't be criticized strictly for racism. The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done, then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique, interesting, and entertaining.",8,20,40,8 March 2018
Drive," Tense and Violent but Forgettable
","I think that Ryan Gosling is the new Steve McQueen. That's not a criticism because I really liked Steve McQueen. He was a humble, understated actor who often played roles where violence ensued. This is a movie about getting in over your head through a moral code that requires you to become a protector, even if it's not in your nature. In addition to some pretty incredible car chases and organized mayhem, this gets down to the tussle between the guy who may want out and the guys who won't let him. It's about money and the Albert Brooks character (playing out of his usual element) is a pretty good adversary. He is offhanded in his appearance, but down and dirty in every aspect of his life, and like most wise guys, he doesn't hesitate to kill even his closest compadres. While there are great possibilities, I could never quite understand how one could sit on such opposite poles and keep it going. We are what we do and, of course, Gosling's driver, for all his skill will be made to pay the piper at some point.",7,0,5,19 September 2012
The Theory of Everything," Genius There Behind the Scenes
","I really enjoyed the wonderful acting in this film. Both leads and a couple of the supporting cast are top notch. What occurred to me after seeing it and reveling in the characterization is that while it's a nice love story, it could have been about almost any talented person who hooks up with an amazing, loyal woman. What I am saying is it is more a story of triumph than a story about Stephen Hawking and what he truly is. We see his day to day existence and his conquest of strife, but we know little of the professional man other than the rewards he receives and the controversy he engenders. Of course, he is the representation of modern physics and cosmology, but that is left for us to read for ourselves. There are documentaries exploring his life as a physicist and some are superior to this. Nevertheless, the love story where one gives all one has for another is hard to dismiss. I found out that Eddie Redmayne spent time with the great genius in order to capture his essence. He spoke of Hawking's great sense of humor and what an incredible labor it is to be him. This will probably be nominated for some Oscars, but beyond the acting categories I don't see much else.",8,2,3,9 January 2015
Frozen," Baby, It's Cold Outside!
","This Disney effort is a delight from beginning to end. It is the story of a young princess who has a curse: anything she touches turns to ice. She can cause glaciers and formations to form just by the wave of a hand. When her parents die, she decides to completely isolate herself from her sister. They grow older on either side of a castle wall. When the castle is opened for the coronation, the younger sister, Anna becomes infatuated with a young prince and actually becomes engaged the same day. When Anna tells Elsa, she is furious and in the process she lets loose all her wintry power, running into the hills. The entire country is now frozen over and Anna's fiancé is left in charge as she runs after her sister. So much has been written, so I won't retrace the ground already trod. If I could offer a layman's advice, it would be to focus more on the character of Elsa. She is the tormented soul who hides away, trying to deal with guilt and despair. She is certainly not unlike Simba in 'The Lion King' trying to find some peace, trying to recover from intense guilt. The cast of peripheral characters are incredible. I found the snowman really wonderful as are the rock creatures who role in and take on the form of trolls. The music is wonderful (even though I can't escape some of the songs these days) and the dialogue and timing wonderful.",9,6,17,26 April 2014
2012," Time I Will Never Get Back!
","l have to admit I did like the scene with Woody Harrelson standing on the hill, raging against the universe. Otherwise, this is probably one of the worst big budget movies I have ever seen. It is full of stereotypes, good guys, bad guys, and a total disregard for the victims of the cataclysm. I challenge even the most scientifically uninformed to sit down and pick this mess apart. People act in incredibly irrational ways. Speeches are made at devastating moments. Of course, if we all pull together, we will come out OK in the end. That is after six billion people have died. The formula is in place (did anyone see the newer version of War of the Worlds). There is the husband who only thinks of his work. He has lost the affections of his beautiful wife and his two cute children. She has hooked up with a nice guy who is base and not intellectual. But he likes the kids and is trying to invade the bond that still clearly exists. It's too much. Then there's the Russian guy with his two fat, ugly little kids with their ugly haircuts, who paid a billion Euro to be saved. Throw in the Washington Monument going down again (did anyone see Earth vs. the Flying Saucers) and hundred other landmarks and any other natural treasures that fall before our eyes, and it gets even more tiresome. Also, there's the stunt flying through smoke and debris by a man with two flying lessons that would make Jimmy Dolittle proud. This thing must have cost a fortune and it has almost nothing going for it. People act stupidly, say stupid things, and every sentimental goodbye is used. I suppose they thought this would make this movie more serious. As it is, it is laughable.",3,0,2,3 March 2010
X-Men: The Last Stand," Interested bystander
","I've attended all three of the X-men films with my son. It's been kind of fun. I never read the comics, so I don't know the intricacies of the characters and their powers. I don't know enough to tell if they are faithful to their comic book roles. Keeping that in mind, I have to say I enjoyed them. I liked the first two more than this one because it had more heart and more character development; more angst if you will. I was intrigued by the 'death' of Jean Grey in the second film. This one is a special effects deluge. When the Golden Gate bridge is moved like a board across a mud puddle, it staggers the imagination. If I were to look at this with too critical an eye, I might say, 'Couldn't the bad guys have done this crossing of San Francisco bay a little easier (maybe a couple of helicopters or a big boat). This part is almost for laughs. I was entertained and involved through most of the movie but at times it became almost a parody of itself. I understand they changed directors and this may account for it. Maybe a summer film can't cut the short attention spans unless we throw so much at the canvas that we can't distinguish the pictures. The performances of the actors are quite good. There are a few questions that we neophytes have a little trouble with, but, all in all, I think most people who like this splashy stuff will be alright with it.",7,0,0,5 June 2006
The Lives of Others," Think Twice Before You Hand Over Too Much to Government
","The Cold War is the center of all this. We were guilty of allowing the division of Germany and the splitting of the city of Berlin. What transpired was a Soviet controlled city with as many informants as citizens (exaggeration, but not that great a one). Of course, the true journalist is going to be the first to go. Don't say anything against the government. The focuses of this film is a young author who has to keep a low profile, and a man who lives right next to him, whose job is to use heavy surveillance on him. Eventually, this man begins to realize the results of his actions and he tries to pull back his invasiveness. The scariest part of this film involves the tactics used to get confessions out of those singled out. Of course, when they can't get to the person, they threaten their wives and children. Of course, since this takes place in 1980, we are in the wake of the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Everyone should see this and think about its implications. There is alo a subtlety and a reserved presentation that makes this work well.",10,1,4,22 February 2016
Good Will Hunting," A Sensitive, Remarkable Look at Genius
","Matt Damon's Will Hunting couldn't be more complex. He is an utter genius. Unfortunately, he has enough baggage to send him around the world. Will is a brilliant mathematician, smarter than many of the professors at MIT. However, he is depressed and self destructive. He gives up the minute things get hard. He can't relate to others, especially women. After many failures to help him, he hooks up with a man who respects him (but who also fears his insights) played by Robin Williams in one of his finer dramatic roles. He pushes Will and Will pushes back. The interaction between two imperfect, but brilliant, human beings is the core of this movie. Created by Damon and Ben Affleck, this was probably the best movie of the year. Will Hunting is searching for happiness, as are we all, but others have decided what that happiness looks like. He is indeed 'hunting' for joy in his life. Excellent performances all around.",10,1,3,28 December 2016
Room," Taking What Could Have Been Maudlin to the Stratosphere
","I hesitated seeing this film because I feared it would be another one of those exploitation films, with scene after scene of threat and pain. Considering a woman and her son have been kept for years in a room in a shed by a sociopath, this could have gone down that road, there are certainly elements of this. But this is about survival and hope, neither of which comes without agonizing risk. It's also about how people deal with things for which they have no true appreciation. I refer to two characters. The first is the father of the young woman. He must deal with what he sees as the devil's spawn. The second, a reporter that begins to malign her because she hasn't done what 'she' sees as heroic. Her interview made me crawl, but I also thought this is exactly what we do to people who gain celebrity through pain. There is a great deal to be learned from this film, but I fear this is an eternal problem.",10,2,4,21 August 2016
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," It's the middle child of the movie.
","This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history.",9,2,4,16 March 2006
Schindler's List," It's About Our Humanity
","We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country.",10,9,13,28 March 2006
Across the Universe," Intriguing: Need to Watch It Again
","Like so many of my contemporaries, I am a lifelong Beatles fan. Like Moulin Rouge and Tommy, or any of the Beatles' movies, this drags us into their milieu. It also has elements of A Clockwork Orange. It is certainly provocative and seems to escaped from the late sixties or early seventies. The anti-war message introduces a group of characters who find they have been reconditioned for combat. There is the embedded love story, and, for the most part, pretty cool renditions of the Beatles' songs. There was a little too much White Album for me, but these songs show a kind of nihilism and sadness that the early ones didn't have. It's a movie that went too fast for me and I will have to rent again. It never came near my home in its theater debut. It's a little gem that bears watching.",8,0,1,5 September 2008
The Incredibles," Plays All the Right Notes
","Hight priced animated features sometimes turn me off. So I was wary. I am a bit hesitant because there are so many coming out these days. That aside, I got a big kick out of this film. First of all, the superheroes portrayed were a family with family problems and weaknesses. There is humor, but it is natural humor, not the lowest common denominator as so many are these days. It has the plot of some adversity, but ultimately there is a kindness here.",9,0,0,2 May 2019
The Elephant Man," The Need to Go On
","This is a masterful portrayal of one of the most interesting characters in history, John Merrick, the Elephant Man. Through the incredible performance of John Hurt, we get to see this as a person, not a sideshow freak, although that element was always there. As the movie evolves, he becomes more than we think he will, actually attaining celebrity. But, like Eric Stoltz, in 'Mask,' society is there to pull him back. He can't be what he wants to be, try as he might. There is rampant cruelty throughout the world and Merrick lived it every day. I know that Roger Ebert leveled a charge of manipulation and sentimentality against this film. This is probably true. Filmmakers can't seem to resist the rather trite emotional tricks at times. The fact that Merrick was rebuilt to some extent for the film may be worthy of criticism. Maybe they did him a disservice by making him a bit more palatable for the movie audience. I don't know. We create fictions in film all the time. If we have a cancer patient, should we show them with pustules braking on their bodies. Perhaps we should to create an accurate portrayal. Perhaps today, the Elephant Man may be more graphic, more difficult to look at. Perhaps that would make a better film. I just know that sentimentality aside, this is a pretty good one.",9,0,0,5 April 2006
I Am Legend," All Special Effects and a Contrived Plot
","This film is well set up with an end of the world kind of condition that occurs when medical scientists really blow it. All that's left, it seems, is Will Smith. He manages to stay alive, fending off wild animals and zombie-like mutants. He studies what's going on. Fortunately for him, he is able to observe one big thing which leads to the conclusion. The thing that annoys me is the deus ex machina conclusion based on Smith's supposed scientific knowledge. Anyway, it is a really forgettable movie. I've never been much of a Will Smith fan. He brings a smugness to his roles that gets tiresome at times. There are so many of these types of movies that are so much better in the science fiction arena. Even the old Vincent Price, 'The Last Man on Earth' is a better film, bleak and depressing as it is.",5,2,3,9 January 2017
Dog Day Afternoon," A Look at the Soul
","One must look beyond the natural inclination to judge these guys as serious criminals and wash our hands of them. Yes, it's a bank robbery. Yes, these guys are small timers and deserve to be punished. But what we have here is an actual look into the souls of the men. They reach a point of no return. We get to look at them as a study in the psychology of a couple of lost souls. Acting is about capturing a character. We can hate Hannibal Lecter and still admire the performance of the actor. That's what we have here. We have one of our most successful and talented actors, Al Pacino, playing the role of a lifetime. As if that were not enough, he is engaged with a partner whose mind is a scattered mess. Watch this and see what true characterization is. In some ways, it is a heartbreaking film.",9,1,2,21 December 2016
The Man Who Would Be King," It Has It All: Danger, Adventure, Religion, and Insanity
","I love it when I chance upon a movie for which I've had no preparation. I had never heard of this when I went into a theater on a hot afternoon. This is a great story of a couple of men who have different motivations. Granted, at the beginning, they are basically con men. The world is their oyster and border controls being what they were at that time, they could move about freely. Well, we know a lot about Afghanistan now, but these guys go off half cocked, and get into the biggest trouble possible. Like 'The River Kwai' they need to cut their losses, but one of them can't do that. He actually begins to be the person he set out to play: that is a god. He doesn't see the danger he is in. One slip and everything comes tumbling down; it is inevitable. Then it become survival. The scene where the monks begin to move in on Connery, is overwhelming. We have people who are willing to die to right a wrong (sound familiar). We see the confusion in the face as he realizes his mistake, but he can't fathom it. It's like the snow blindness on the way in. It is now another version of snow blindness that must be faced. The plot is exquisite, based on the Kipling book. Michael Cain and Sean Connery. It doesn't get much better than that. Beautiful sets. Magnificent mountains. The whole move give me that uneasy feel in the pit of my stomach. You've got to get out of there. But they can't hear me.",9,2,4,4 April 2006
Unknown," Way Too Much Suspension of Disbelief
","I have to admit that I'm not as critical as some when it comes to willing suspension of disbelief. I know by their natures that movies are borderline fantasy anyway. You are asked into a plot that if not contrived by the writer/director, there would be no sustainable plot. That is, we are asked to leave everyday life to engage in the exploits of a group of fictional characters. Putting that aside, the circumstances we are asked to buy into are so fragile that even the slightest mistake will bring this house of cards tumbling onto the table. I admit I was manipulated and prodded here and there, but it reached a point where I felt if they said Liam Neeson's character had disguised himself as a duck, I would have to say, 'That makes sense.' So much is based on so many tenuous circumstances that we are left stunned by the arrogance of the script. I'm sure some will buy into this if they don't think too much. That's fine, but I suspect that for most this doesn't pass muster. I like the actors in this movie. I'm sure they did the best they can, but it's the story that doesn't stand up. See this at your own risk.",4,2,3,22 January 2013
Ghostbusters," So Much Fun/Such Great People
","If one could get his or her tongue any farther into their cheek, I don't know how it is possible. Here we have the Second City people and they play this for everything it's worth. No one really ever asks why these ghosts have appeared or why Ghostbusters exists. It is taken for granted. Of course, they have all these machines that are based on some made-up scientific principles. But who cares? The movie is really a series of hilarious encounters among the characters and their effort to rid New York City of the threat. Bill Murray is the wise cracking leader of the group with sidekick Dan Aykroyd following suit. Sigourney Weaver supplies the female interest and then there are the amazing special effects. This is a sojourn into utter craziness with an almost Marx Brothers kind of mentality. I always get kick out of this movie. Rick Moranis is also a great character, unflappable to the end.",9,4,6,1 December 2016
Call Me by Your Name," Love Story
","Well crafted and cinematically beautiful. I have to admit that it pushed my comfort level. I try to watch as many critically acclaimed films as I can. I found the development believable in a world that is out of my realm. Of the films I've seen in this genre, this is probably the best crafted and insightful of all. It has a sense of unattainability at times that drives one forward. The direction is striking.",9,2,6,29 April 2020
Gran Torino," Less Than the Sum of Its Parts
","I enjoyed this film. Eastwood is about as snarly as I've ever seen him. He has taken Archie Bunker to the next level. He terrorizes his neighbors, is hateful to his children, and incredibly intolerant of a changing world. With that said, this is a story about redemption. It comes in small increments and the charm is not in what happens eventually, but what happens in each small doses. His slow developing relationship with the Hmong family next door. Because he steps in in a crisis situation, their culture sees him as a hero and sets out to reward him. They bring him endless presents and food. Because he leads such a lonely existence, he is slowly, but surely, pulled in. He keeps a balance of hatred for the punks he sees with a true love for those who have befriended him.lThe whole thing kind of slides off into predictability toward the end, but it's a good story and had to end some way, especially with Kowalski's self realizations and his rendezvous with death. The other thing is just watching a masterful actor take on this role and squeeze every last drop out of it.",8,0,8,10 September 2009
The Hurt Locker," An Amazingly Intense Two Hours!
","I think that some of the critics are missing the point in this film. Many Iraqi vets have responded negatively. I'm sure there are some serious inaccuracies in military protocol and day to day activity. However, take any movie that involves a particular profession or walk of life, analyze it, and it will fall apart. Take police films, for instance. I have a police officer friend who has been on the force for 20 years. He's never had to fire his gun. Most police officers seldom use their weapons. That's why it's so hard on them when they need to face a gunman. Still, the police in many of our best movies use their guns like they use their flashlights. If Dirty Harry were real, he would have lasted about a week on the police force. Does that diminish the effect of the film? We suspend the disbelief for films. This is more than a movie about Iraq. It's a movie about a man who is devoted to the adrenaline rush, a man for whom pure danger rules his life. He is wired for violence and the need to face death at every turn. The people around him are frightened to death because this guy has no sense of order. He is loose cannon and those around him should have run for the hills, but the honor code keeps them there. This movie has tense scene after tense scene, centered around the next explosive device. It also has a character who can't relate to other people except in the most violent way. He pulls it back every so often, but eventually returns to his own demons. It also has a surreal element like 'Apocalypse Now.' At times there is a dreamy sense that hovers in the heat of the desert. There is a scene where he has gone to the home of a boy whose body was booby trapped with explosives. When he runs through the streets, we can see that he is out of place with time and space. It has those same eerie qualities. As for the aforementioned 'Apocalypse Now,' it was not a realistic movie either, but it was great because it drew from the fear and terror of war. For people who have seen this war, you have been through things that we civilians can't imagine, but remember that despite certain details being out of joint, it still portrays the horrors of war. The main character is almost metaphysical in a sense as he walks in that suit toward another potential death scene.",9,3,9,23 February 2010
The Longest Day," A Noble Topic/Maybe Too Ambitious for One Film
","The D-Day invasion was a major event in the history of the world. Eisenhower decided that it was time to join the allies and invade via the beaches at Normandy. This movie could have beens stronger if it had been a little more concise and taken on a smaller piece of the story. It tries to get at virtually every aspect of the invasion from the points of view of five different entities. Granted, it has some incredible performances (and some sort of dull ones), but, again, there were just too many stories to keep track of; hence, most of them are just a bit undernourished. Don't get me wrong. It's a terrific film at time, and they do a good job of presenting that story. The movie is based on a very extensive novel by Cornelius Ryan.",7,1,4,8 December 2016
Moulin Rouge!," Those French Really Have Fun
","This is a true experience. I was halfway through the movie. I still didn't understand it, but I sat in its lush glow and vivacity. Baz Luhrmann threw together a mass of elements into a soup that will make some people hate it and others love it. For whatever reason, I walked out of the theater exhilarated. First, we have the love story. Satine and her young writer. We know it is doomed from the time she coughs into her handkerchief. Then there is the theatre. It's what we might see something like this in our dreams. Then there are the French painters, mugging and wandering through, stealing scenes. Through in some contemporary music mixed with music created for the film. It's a hodgepodge. I remember a story by Ray Bradbury where a Chinese emperor doesn't want to face reality. I believe it is called 'The Flying Machine.' He stairs at a mechanical toy with artificial birds and flowers. This is like one of those wondrous machines. I don't even know if we can form an emotional attachment for the characters because they are like dolls moving through the amazing numbers and visual delights. I remember trying to tell someone why I liked this, and by the time I finished, I could see that he would not go near this movie. And yet, for some of us, it reels us in and holds us to the very end. Go figure.",9,1,3,2 March 2006
Slap Shot," It's So Stupid, It's Actually a Hoot
","Like 'Bull Durham,' the sport takes second fiddle to a bunch of intrigue. It's about aging players, greedy owners, manipulation, on and on. Paul Newman decides he has to take action to make sure his team manages to draw. In the small city where they play, there is a mill. The people who work at the mill are the fans. The mill is going to close, which will render the place a ghost town. This moves into an anything-for-a-laugh hockey movie with some totally unforgettable characters. When the Carlson brothers show up and goon hockey starts, we are amazed at the way the whole game becomes nearly surreal. Don't take this seriously.",7,1,1,23 December 2016
Ex Machina," All That Money to Build a Woman When We Already Have Several Billion
","Despite my silly summary statement, I liked this film. Now there are some issues that one might confront. One would be motivation. A genius is able to turn his company into the biggest money maker in the world. He goes off to his own paradise and begins to work magic with artificial intelligence. He builds an incredibly sexy android, and then maneuvers a young man to his on the ruse that they will be working together. We quickly see that he is not honest with the young guy and he has somehow become a pawn in his sick game. The point of everything is to see if the young man and the android can forget what they are and establish a loving, caring, relationship. The problem is that there has been a lot of programming and abusiveness, and this leads to a sort of rebellion. Unfortunately, we begin with one character stacking the deck. But, he has some real issues with alcohol and self abuse. Back to motivation. Is this a story about a man, or does it have broader themes relating to creating machines that are potentially self engendering and superior. These questions alone make this a worthwhile film. Visually, it is utterly fantastic.",8,3,6,20 September 2015
Patton," Separate Your Impressions from the Man
","I sometimes grow weary of war movies. So many of them are a glorification of something that is about death and destruction. So often the victors in movies are glorified but we don't get a picture of the victims. George Patton was a great general, which also meant that he gave his life to war and all its implications. Soldiers are his pawns to him. Winning in battle is the only thing, no matter what the cost. I remember the line about dying for your country--the idea is to get the other poor son of a bitch to die for his country. I look upon this as the worst of human ideology. So how can I give this a 10? It's because George C. Scott becomes Patton, with all his bluster and arrogance. This is one of the best performance ever by an actor in any film. When I see Scott standing in front of the flag, I think I am watching Patton himself. There is also the fact that he is not seen as some sort of Hollywood creation. He is there, warts and all. I love this movie.",10,4,5,22 December 2016
La Grande Illusion," The Dignity of War!
","To a post World War II viewer, the idea of a prison camp like this one seems a little hard to fathom. The French are at War with the Germans in World War I, and a group of officers have been arrested. They spend their waking hours trying escape; it is their duty. Enter Erich Von Stroheim. He plays a German officer with many broken parts. A neck brace keeps him from turning his head. He must pivot at the waist. This gives him an odd stiff appearance. He comes from an aristocratic background and enjoys the company of officers, even enemy officers. This is an amazing contrast between the realities and pain of war and an ancient code that made war seem almost dignified. At one point the French officers are handed their own manuals and expected to conduct themselves according to a written set of principles.One officer gives his life so that others may escape. The men are taken in by a farm widow. This expresses the incredible sadness of war and the uncertainty of the future. At no time does Renoir get overly dramatic. He plays things out subtly and with grace. Even with that, you leave the film knowing that war is the worst thing we can foist on each other.",10,0,3,10 September 2009
The Illusionist," I Was Totally Involved
","This movie came out about the time 'The Prestige' did. I really enjoyed that movie for its multiple plot levels. It also stayed a mystery to the end. I enjoyed both of them. I wish there were more films like these. This one sets you up by making it known that the purpose of the main character is to fool you. The film then sets about to do so, not with a bunch of gratuitous magic, but with a carefully plotted set of circumstances. You laugh, you cringe, you cry, you're outraged. The performance of Edward Norton is really admirable. He puts that neutral face on every event and yet you know he's teeming with emotion. His sense of love and craft are carefully integrated and we know the bad guy is going to pay in some way. One gets a little jaded sometime when films fail to deliver. Or the writer or director paint themselves into a corner. This doesn't happen here. There is something around every corner, but it doesn't jump out; it lies there unopened. You need to open it.",9,0,1,31 August 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Intriguing Premise, But...
","This movie is a visual feast. It is lush with the images of America in all its incarnations from the early 20th Century. I agree with Roger Ebert that the premise is also the thing that short circuits the film. Once Benjamin comes to realize what is happening to him, he now has to play by a set of rules that are not of his own making. All relationships of any substance are clouded by his fate. Even taking the premise about living in the here and now because we all eventually meet our end, doesn't help me. The sadness that hangs over the entire movie (which is awfully long for drama), with all of the implications of outliving virtually everyone, make it a hard sell. Even with all of that, I thought there were wonderful performances by just about everyone. I am a great Brad Pitt fan and felt that he was masterful in his performance. I was pleased that the transitioning of his being wasn't accelerated. The gradual movement back to his youth is subtle and the make-up and special effects people are to be congratulated. They also integrate his mental acuity with his physical change. I could go on. I just believe that this is a good, engaging film, but it was doomed somewhat from the start.",8,0,1,28 September 2009
Pawn Sacrifice," Spider-Man to Bishop 3
","This is a look at a complex man who was both a genius and mental case. Bobby Fischer dominated the news during the sixties as he faced off with Boris Spassky, the world chess champion. Toby Maguire is excellent as the cracked talent, filled with paranoia and Cold War craziness. He believed he was the greatest chess player in the world, but is his own demons constantly got in his way. Somewhere along the line, at a very early age, he became obsessed with the red threat. His own mother rubbed elbows with communists and the whole country was in fear of the Soviet Union. Fischer, when left alone, assumed he was being bugged, and went to dramatic lengths to find these bugs. He was also highly sensitive to sound. When he met Spassky for the first match of the world championship, he began to react to even the slightest sounds. Probably about as autistic as one could be, he made the people managing him go to great lengths to appease his ridiculous demands, including holding one match in a storage room. Spassky is portrayed as a bit of a paranoic himself. This is a movie about a man who is hard to like, but the portrayal is well crafted. This is the best thing Maguire has done, in my opinion.",9,0,2,1 March 2016
Hidden Figures," Engaging Story of Endurance
","This film gives us a set of characters that I never knew existed. They were women involved as 'computers' during the early days of the space program. We get to know each of them a bit. Unfortunately, they are defined a bit too much by their work. It would have been interesting to get into more of the day to day pressures they experienced when they were not at NASA. With that said, it still is interesting to see what went on and how they strove for dignity and acceptance in the face of racial prejudice. Of course, NASA was (is) in the South, so hanging over everything are all the things that those who simply lived normal lives had to deal with. I understand that the whole thing with running to the bathroom was fiction. But it made a point. The writing on the blackboard and standing on a ladder is visual, but it was more likely done in notebooks or on pieces of paper. Did an entire group of these women march into the IBM computer room and take over? Probably not en masse. But I gave it a nine because it was a hallmark in showing us what these ladies, who were every bit as competent as their white counterparts, had to do to get respect. The movie is touching and exciting. I was pleased to see the events surrounding John Glenn's historic flight. I remember as a high school kid, how much we feared for his fate. The performers are quite delightful in their own ways. I thought the relationships with the husbands and husbands to be were a bit too contrived, but that's fine. We weren't there. See this movie.",9,8,17,28 January 2017
Lincoln," Inner Workings of the Government
","I have to admit that despite my cynicism about government, I loved 'The West Wing' and enjoy so much a movie that digs into the real politics of a time. While there are a couple of schmaltzy moments in this film (like Lincoln's first appearance to the young soldiers), I was able to forgive that and allow them to start their story. I think that Daniel Day-Lewis has again become the character that he is portraying. I've read that there are numerous descriptions of Lincoln's dialectic and his voice quality. I'm sure the technicians worked hard to create as much authenticity as possible. I stopped thinking of actors nearly a quarter into the film and began to see them as well-developed historical figures. Sally Field is one of America's great actresses. She has proved that. Her Mary is troubled but played with restraint. She is not the howling nut case that is how she is unfortunately portrayed. She is fragile and deserves pathos. The politicians are intriguing and flawed in their own ways, just as all human beings are. Tommy-Lee Jones creates an unforgettable figure. The real hero of this film is a script that pulls and tugs at people who carry the baggage of the nineteenth century with them in their decision making. The Union is at a pass that could cause it to come tumbling down. It is LIncoln who sees this and begins to strong-arm those who have the ultimate say. He isn't kindly old Abe in these circumstances. Greatness requires one to leave a few bodies along the way (figuratively, of course). He also is seen as a man who understands the world he is cast into. One wonders why he took this on; what was in it for him? This is a splendid film. The acting is unparalleled. The battlefield effects show a person who has a deep understanding of pain and violence. I was not disappointed in this for a moment.",10,1,4,22 January 2013
Pi," The Tormented Soul of the Mathematician
","There is so much pain in this film, it is so unsettling. While hard to watch, I couldn't take my eyes off it. The central character abuses drugs, hides, and lives in a circle of computer hardware, like a kind of Phantom of the Opera organ. He plays with numbers and sees patterns. People are aware of him because he has insights into the stock market and, ultimately, the Hassidic faith. He is pursued by bad guys, but it is ultimately his own demons that go after him. He drills holes in his head and punches drugs into his system. Eventually he finds a set of 216 numbers that provide and answer and incredible danger. This movie is not for everyone. It is so frantic, moving at the breakneck pace of an amphetamine high. Because I admire mathematics, I will take those three repeated premises with me: (1) that mathematics is the language of the universe, (2) nature can be expressed in numbers, and (3) there are patterns everywhere. I won't look at the world quite the same after this.",9,0,1,20 November 2009
Children of Men," Bleak and Frightening
","I read this novel about five years ago, though it was written even earlier. I was intrigued that P. D. James, one of my favorite British mystery writers had written a Sci Fi dystopian novel. The book captivated me, but the movie made it hard to sleep. It is the stuff that we worry about. That when our culture ceases to reproduce, what is there to save and create and do for? The images are very documentary-like. The cinematography is outstanding, and the acting is simple and real. As you probably already know, anarchy has been unleashed on the world and the British government is trying to sustain its borders. This happens because for many years, women have been unable to produce children. I remember the Arthur C. Clarke book Childhood's End, which is a new epistemology, ala 2001: A Space Odyssey. This movie is down and dirty and much more realistic. What if a virus or some meddling with science could bring about this reality, would be react the way these cultures have, every man for himself. If there is a criticism, it would probably be that we don't get to the roots of the anarchy. It seems like an awfully short time for so much to have happened. This is one of the most thoughtful movies I've seen in some time. It has a real message and doesn't pull any punches.",9,1,13,22 October 2007
Million Dollar Baby," A Story of Redemption
","When you make a film with characters, true characters, you have won half the battle. The characters in this film are on a crash course with emptiness, until they find each other. The tired, stagnant life of the Clint Eastwood fight manager, Morgan Freeman, who has sold his needs to watch his friend, and, of course, Hillary Swank, who is trying to find someplace to keep her from ending up like her trailer trash family. If one were to simply look at the plot, it would seem pretty trite. Girl wants to be a fighter (a contemporary possibility; her gender really isn't important), manager hasn't had a fighter in years (he is a curmudgeon who sees the negative in things), and the talent will out. But then the element of tragedy rears its ugly head, and the plot becomes more complex. But it is the characterization that wins the day. We get to know and love these three people (actually a fourth; a young boxer who continues to get the crap beat out of him but who provides another example of what we should be. It is, of course, ultimately about love: love for self, love for others, and love for why we are put on this earth. I was really moved by this film. It is a masterpieces of redemption and will. It is about victory through pain.",9,2,2,23 February 2006
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Finally Decided to Watch It
","This is certainly a pleasant surprise. Tim Burton, purveyor of the wacko, has created, along with his amazing team, a real classic work. Seldom does a film bank on so much originality, from the incredible creation of Halloween Town, with its denizens, marvelous in their diversity and variety, to a really interesting plot. The character of Jack Skellington is a scene-stealer. Considering he pretty much a stick with a round, skeletal head, he has amazing expression and energy. He is an artist and a rebel, dissatisfied with the continuing shortsightedness of his frightening peers. When his world opens up through an accidental fall into another town, paralleling his own, he tries to bring Christmas back with him. The problem is that he really doesn't understand the concept well enough. He mixes his own social foundation with an alien one and the results are hilarious. Wonderful to look at with some of the finest animation you will ever see, each moment carefully scripted and produced.",9,1,1,7 September 2017
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Exciting and Complex
","I read the book before I'd heard anyone talk about it. This was before the huge upheaval of praise for the late Stieg Larsson's three novels. This is a very well done film which benefits from being filmed in Sweden. It is dark and intriguing. Lisbeth Salander, the heroine, is pretty much one-of-a-kind. She has led a dark life after a horrible upbringing. She has been abused by the 'system.' She hooks up with a high profile investigative reporter who is known as a bit of a womanizer. The two find themselves in the middle of a case involving the disappearance, many years before, of the daughter of a very rich man. This leads them to uncover many unsettling facts. Lisbeth is a self taught technologist and uses this, along with her almost catlike resolve. to deal with the worst of the worst. I have not seen the second film yet, but look forward to it.",9,2,5,13 October 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," So Tense because It Was So True
","The McCarthy era caused so much pain in this country. It's interesting that after we had just finished fighting a multitude of tyrants, a man like the Senator from Wisconsin was allowed to play the same kinds of mind games that these despicable men did. Ed Murrow is part of my youth and I remember the sober, almost dark way he looked into the camera. He was incredible because he should have been scared. He kept us informed when the fledgling networks were trying to find out what they had in their hands. This film oozes with threat. Not the Freddy Kreuger kind of threat. The kind that is in the house next door and in the minds of the guys sitting at the local bar. Murrow was often seen as a 'Pinko.' It's so interesting that the people who look out for the little guy are portrayed as threats. It's that 'What's wrong with Kansas' thing that becomes more dangerous than most threats because it is inside us. Anyway, fine performances all around, great tension, and a retelling of a very exciting if terrifying chapter in our history.",10,3,5,28 March 2008
Mulholland Drive," Another Bad Dream from David Lynch (In a Good Way)
","What can I say. Each time I see a David Lynch film, I see my own disturbing dreams in them. The fundamental story has to do with two people whose paths cross; a woman who survives a murder attempt because a group of teenagers are joyriding and crash the car she is riding in. She finds herself at a home in a bedroom which is the temporary quarters of a young actress. That would be enough for an interesting film, but Lynch would never do that. He brings in other sets of characters in counterpoint to the main ones and after a while we don't know who's who anymore. We also have some of that crazy cinematography and visuals that are left to our imaginations. All the participants show up together, yet they shouldn't have that relationship; or should they. I did enjoy seeing Billy Ray Cyrus get his clock cleaned. I was content to let the whole thing wash over me. I wondered what happened and then I didn't care.",9,5,9,30 November 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Take the Idea and Run
","While I thought this was a good movie, my thoughts at times came back to the standard premise around the situation comedy. Let's take this character and this character, throw them together, and see what happens. There are so many movies about the Holocaust. Some are based on real events and others take the events that took place and extrapolate on them. I couldn't get over the premise of 'What if you took the young son of the commandant of a death camp during the Holocaust and he met a little Jewish boy?' The whole relationship and the lack of basic security kind of throws me. The boys seem to have the run of things. When they meet, except for the siren that forces one of them back, it's as if they are ignored. Now, if we accept the premise put forth and can believe in it, it becomes, of course, an indictment of blind loyalty and a tragedy. I just never got there. The performances are good and there's that edge that Nazi power presents, so it's still very hard to watch, but I'm just left with an empty, skeptical sense.",7,0,0,15 November 2009
Guardians of the Galaxy," A Nice Surprise for a Non-Comic Book Guy
","Every time I watch one of these films, I am immediately at a disadvantage because I don't know the mythology behind them. It didn't matter here because while progressing the story, we were filled in well by commentary from the characters. Chris Pratt is a funny guy with his endless sincerity and optimism. What works here, and what others have said, is the humor is offhand enough, but funny enough, to not interfere with the mission. The good guys (as well as the sort-of good guys) have a nice chemistry. Some are clueless and some are simply very clever. I remember seeing the ads for this a year or so ago and the raccoon put me off in the ads. As it turns out, he was a dynamic, sympathetic character who is himself a victim of circumstances. He ever gets called a hamster at one point. Anyway, I just wanted to weigh in on a very entertaining film. I'm sure the sequel will continue the fun.",8,1,5,19 August 2015
The Imitation Game," Take It as a Tale of an Amazing Man, Even Though it May Have Some Suspect History
","This is the story of Allen Turing, who really existed. He is the mathematical genius who was engaged to try to break the German code 'Enigma' during World War II. He is autistic and humorless, totally insensitive, with no regard for social interaction. He is driven by the task at hand and feels other things are superfluous. He is also under the gun from a commandeer who he insulted and who would love to be rid of him. Had his colleagues not reluctantly come to his aid when he was under attack, he would never have been able to do the work he did. He has one other problem. He is homosexual and at this time this is illegal and would get him drummed out of service and probably imprisoned. There are flashbacks of his youth, made horrible by his peers. It shows his relationship with Christopher, a boy whom he loves, the one person who gives him his due and his respect. Something terrible occurs after a school vacation, and Alan is left alone. The acting is quite incredible. Benedict Cumberbatch is turning into a major actor (to the chagrin of the 'Sherlock' fans). Keira Knightly does a nice job as the female foil, who even agrees to marriage with Alan (although it is utterly doomed by his own admission). One of the stars is an amazing computer that Alan puts his life and heart into, designed to break the aforementioned code. It spins and clicks. For many, this was the first real modern computer (for all you abacus fans, I don't mean to be disrespectful). This is the story of another genius (keep in mind the current film about Stephen Hawking) who experiences heartbreak at every turn, whose peers hate but tolerate him. It's the story of a society that devalues a man because of the way he was born, that dismisses his accomplishments. There are two really emotional scenes. One is when he throws himself in front of his computer (which is named after his friend Christopher) as the military Philistines start to destroy it. And a scene with the headmaster of his school when Alan must say he barely knew the boy whom he loved. See this. One of the best films of 2014.",9,3,9,5 February 2015
The Piano," Acting with the face
","If one wants to see true acting, just watch Hollie Hunter in this film. She does more with her facial expressions than twenty actors can with a thousand words. Her stature, her presence, her determination are so intense. One could feel sorry for her in places. She has been ripped from her world for reasons we cannot fathom. She has been deemed expendable. When she arrives she expects to be treated properly. Anna Paquin as her daughter settles into the new environment and begins to prosper. But it is not without sacrifice. The piano is the symbol of what was left behind. Her affair with the Maori is partly passion, partly payment. We never know how much of each. The performances are stunning across the board and, this time, worthy of Academy Awards. There are some very sensual scenes and scenes of great danger. There is pain inflicted and selfishness and power. Hollie Hunter rises above it all and makes her way through this quagmire (the rainy muddy jungle in this case), and arises, victorious in her own fashion.",9,54,85,9 March 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Someone must be in between
","Did everyone either love this or despise it? I watched this with my son shortly after he had had four wisdom teeth removed. He was on pain killers--I was keeping him company and he asked me to rent this. He's much more savvy than I am toward these things. It was intriguing--Quentin Trantino's blood fest. Now, is this a ballet or a movie, because if one does not suspend disbelief (even at the bedrock of the thing) this is just ridiculous. Arms severed, blood flying, one gory scene after another, one trying to outdo the previous one. As with most of this stuff, anyone who has ever banged his shin or cut himself, knows that it takes very little to disable a human being. So, if you go ahead and accept that human beings can handle this, then you move right into fantasy, and as I said, a ballet of violence. Choreographed as are most martial arts movies, it works as a meandering blood portrait, a Jackson Pollock of gore. Numbers mean nothing. One person defeats an army. The army simply widens the landscape and the dance continues. Is there anyone in this movie we care about. I can't think of one. Enlighten me. Everything escalates and we are left with one last part of the ballet.Pardon my naiveté, but the people who love this stuff--why? What is it in you that makes you gravitate toward it? I know I'm an old fogie, but it's easy to see why we don't care what happens to people in war. We feed ourselves a constant diet of this. The violence on the streets continues. 'A Clockwork Orange' predicted this culture a long time ago and, look around, we have met the enemy and he is us. I suppose that every movie is looked at as art. Even the wost filmmakers call themselves artists (musicians seem to always do this), and there's little question that Quentin Tarantino has an incredible camera eye. I would be interested in seeing if he can make something other than a blood bath.",5,1,2,2 March 2006
The Last Emperor," Film-making at Its Best; Great Historical Recreation
","I found I could not take my eyes off this film for many reasons. The first is a view of a culture we in the West don't understands. Tradition is at the center of everything and the Emperor is in the middle of it all. Now add the circumstances of the reign. First of all, the great and powerful Emperor can't leave the forbidden city. He is pursued by people willing to die for him, though many are crooks and people of questionable character. You then add the maturity level of the boy given this title Obviously, he has no tools to do what he is supposed to do. His divine right makes it a zoo in the palace. He is attracted to Western culture and want so badly to be a celebrity playing outside the walls of his imposed exile. He gets in bed with the Japanese because it gives him an opportunity to regain power but pretty much brings his undoing. I can't begin to explain all the elements in this film that are so impressive. Others can do that so much better. The incredible time shifts from his incarceration and 'confession' to a time in China when so much 'strange' stuff was going on is portrayed so well. There aren't many three hour plus movies I will watch a second time, but this is one of them. The performances by all are so striking. Peter O'Toole is outstanding, as are all the incarnations of the Emperor. This really deserved its Oscar.",10,0,0,12 November 2009
Jerry Maguire," Soul Reclamation
","As upset as I get with him, I can't help but like Tom Cruise. He does a nice job as the irrepressible Jerry Maguire, a sports agent making it big, but feeling empty about it. He works for people he doesn't respect. He analyses where he is at and decides to fend for himself. He will start a new firm by getting a couple top names to go with him. It's not easy and soon he is without a job and without a single client. The only one who goes with him is young Renee Zelwigger. Cruise's fiancée and just about everyone else (even those for him he made big money) bales on him. What is left is a twofold plot. One is his hopes of signing a can't lose prospect played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. The other is starting his life over with a person who really loves him. This is a quick, interesting look into the world of sports agents.",7,1,1,29 December 2016
Clash of the Titans," It Does Have Some Cool Scorpions!
","All the joy I had in the hokey first film, disappeared as I watched this plodding, endless remake. There is no suspense, no justification, and the myth itself is pretty much ignored and changed around. There are characters that never existed. It seems that for twenty minutes they battle giant scorpions that later become their camels. The acting is dull. There is no human story. The Kraken is boring. We also have a brother fight between Zeus and Hades where Hades tricks his brother and the big Z has to go along with his wishes. All in all, by the time it was over there was no surprise, no tension, and no satisfaction. And what about Andromeda? Anyway, another time where Hollywood couldn't come up with anything new, so they decided to make this snorer.",5,1,1,30 August 2010
Jurassic World," A Bigger Better Killer
","We have reached the point where the incredible special effects are becoming mundane. We've seen these dinosaurs attack humans and other dinosaurs before. The new one, a genetically engineered killing machine that has parts of other dinosaurs, is no more remarkable than its predecessors. I didn't see it doing anything more intellectual than any other dinosaur. Once again, the cheap use of vulnerable children is at the center of things. They have been sent to be with their aunt who is a big shot in the Jurassic Park business. She is self centered and insensitive, even when her orders lead to carnage. Vincent D'Onofrio is the heavy, although there are enough of those to go around. Chris Pratt is the take charge guy who has learned to bond with velociraptors. The kids, of course, pay no attention to orders given, and get themselves into a life or death situation. Now everyone has to try to save them. Of course, there is a huge dose of intensity as things go from bad to worse. The two leads who have virtually no personality begin to bond from a caustic first encounter. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's just the same old stuff. There is nothing new here. The other thing. What about all the people who have been killed or maimed? Do our heroes really care? If you want to consider the real world, imagine the lawsuits and medical claims from gross negligence. Not to mention charges of manslaughter. And our red headed heroine would be hung out to dry. Finally, we do need a better, more creative story other than people being assaulted time after time by creatures fifty times their size and somehow managing to get away.",6,4,12,23 June 2015
Paranormal Activity," The Threat Began to Follow Me
","At first I found this about as tedious as anything I've ever seen. It was, of course, a home movie from a pretty much stationary video camera. The people do the things people do on a daily basis. It's one boring thing after another. However, as time goes along, we begin to be pulled into the nuances of the unfriendly spirit that haunts the young woman and her husband/boyfriend. What happens is not really life threatening or seriously significant through most of the film, but at some point, there is an overwhelming threat that permeates every scene and we begin to watch the two lumps in the bed, waiting for the next action. I will not spoil this movie. I will say that considering most of what goes on is cerebral and left to the imagination, I found myself staring at the screen. Neither character is very likable or even kind. His obsession with his camera would have driven most women out of that marriage. There is no compassion or concern for her well-being. Nevertheless, we don't have to like characters to profit from their experiences. Suffice it to say, they become caught up in their own shortsightedness and inability to overcome inertia. It's a fascinating little film.",8,1,2,5 January 2011
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," The Update Doesn't Do It for Me
","I'm not giving this 'ones' because I liked the first film much better, but it just fell short for me. Gene Wilder kept the Wonka edge going but Johnny Depp somehow took most of the humor out of the new version. I didn't see anything new, other than a lot of special effects (which one would expect) and the Oompa Loompas (whom I enjoyed). As is usually the case, there are efforts to update things with some of the music and some sight gags. But Depp just gets more and more weird, almost to the level of child abuse. Don't get me wrong, it's a great story, but I never was engaged. See it and make your own judgment. It certainly does have the Tim Burton touch which is always worth a shot.",6,4,7,26 January 2015
A Bug's Life," I Hope This Doesn't Bug You! Can't Help It!
","The Disney animation is again top notch. Like the movie Antz, we have a rebel in the collective. The ant population has been victimized by the bullying grasshoppers who come by each year to collect their 'share.' They are like mob bosses. They are also huge, compared to the ants. So along comes Flik who because of his best intentions, makes things even worse. He is brought before a tribunal and banished. Of course, like any self respecting outcast, it is his job to reclaim his right to be part of the culture. He is creative and inventive and so he has the tools to manage this. Even though things are predictable, they still come off quite nicely, visually.",8,0,0,11 March 2017
Rudy," I Love This Film
","I know that some of this movie was messed around with. If you read an actual biography, you will find some inaccuracies, but that doesn't matter because this movie is about the personal dreams of the average guy. Rudy Ruettiger is a young guy whose family works in a steel mill and Rudy is probably doomed to that life. It's not terrible but it is dangerous (Rudy's best friend dies) and the young guy wants a better life. He is a very good high school football player with a lot of heart, but this will probably be the end of his playing days. Rudy is a disinterested student, so his chances of even getting into college are almost nil. When a group of seniors are going on a college trip to Norte Dame, he is not allowed on the bus. But he has a dream and he heads off to South Bend and tries to talk his way in. He ends up going to Holy Cross, a nearby school, and he is told that if he can get high grades, they will look at him again. Well, we all know the story. He qualifies academically. He manages to get on the scout squad at Notre Dame by showing that he is willing to nearly kill himself to impress the coaches. But they won't give him a chance to play in a game, which means he isn't actually a true member of the historical powerhouse. Until something happens. If you've never seen this, go for it.",8,0,1,2 January 2017
Prisoners," Hard to Watch but Really Well Done
","Two very good actors ply their trade very well. Jake Gyllanhaal plays a policeman who is utterly driven in his quest to find two kidnapped little girls. Hugh Jackman plays a survivalist who 'prays for the best but expects the worst.' During Thanksgiving dinner, two little girls go up to a rusty old RV and shortly thereafter, disappear. The prime suspect is a mentally handicapped young man, the driver of the RV. But the girls are nowhere to be found. He is held for 48 hours and then released. It is then that Jackman takes matters into his own hands. He kidnaps the young man and, convinced he knows everything, tortures him and beats him for days. Meanwhile, another suspect arises but Jackman can't handle this and keeps pounding away. There are numerous twists and turns that seem to work well. Gyllanhaal is a troubled guy himself who has some anger issues that he keeps under wraps. I had not heard of this film and it was a treat to view it.",9,0,0,24 April 2017
Silence," Heart of Darkness
","I feel inadequate to make a really intelligent analysis of this film. Not being able to embrace the essence of seventeenth century Catholicism and the mission in Japan, I will only comment on the sense this film gave me. I understand that the two men at the center of 'Silence' are incredibly pious, wishing to save the soul of their mentor. But they are also pretty naive in their approach. Somehow, they feel they can take on centuries of hatred for their religion, armed only with their faith. They also have no idea how torture and the fear of death could lead to apostasy. Liam Nisson's character succumbs to it and so the object of their purpose has had time to settle into his newfound comfort. He could be seen as a coward; or one could see him as a fact of life. Speaking of life, while Martin Scorsese is one of my top five directors all time, this really plods along as repetitious and lacking in any kind of unresolved conflict. Mercifully, we are finally led to face to face we have been waiting for. I felt relief rather than excitement as this was finally here. I suppose one who is a little short on religious fervor might say that when you invade someone else's territory, you run the risk of playing by their rules eventually. This is a striking film, but, for me, not one I will remember long. There are graphic scenes of torture and violence, but they are sort of detached from our immediate experience.",8,1,5,21 May 2017
Logan," Can't Speak as a Fanboy
","I've seen several X-men films already, but I have never been entirely sure of all the baggage and relationships. So as I watched this, I was pleased that the filmmaker assumed not everyone knew the underlying details. This was exciting. It's obvious that the original crew has fallen on hard times. Wolverine is falling apart. His healing ability is pretty much at its end. He has decided to try to withdraw and let life take its course. But, unfortunately, he is confronted by an evil next step by the lineage of the X-men experiments. This is a wild ride as his 'daughter,' a clone of him, and he try to find other kids who have been changed and bring them to safety. Of course, the bad guys don't want their escapades to get out. I do have to say that I am really getting tired of all the gore and the endless fighting. Still, it was satisfying. It also leaves the doors open for a whole new generation.",9,3,4,14 January 2019
Big Fish," There Are Lots of Big Fish in the Sea
","I had the advantage of having read the novel before the movie. The book works a little better. Others have talked about the specifics of the movie. I want to talk about the premise of the lie. My father was a liar (often in the most positive sense of the word). My sister and I grew up with so much misinformation, that we have spent the last 30 years after his death trying to rake through the BS. We often heard tales like the ones in the book (not quite as dramatic but creative nevertheless). It was mostly things he had done. That he had accomplished. Why we were so darned poor after all this always confused me. If someone had met all those people and had all those experiences, why hadn't he parlayed them into something incredible. Once we got through it, we realized he wasn't a liar. He was an entertainer. And what he did was to pump life into a world that often doesn't have life. And while we would groan at him and tell him to stop, we would listen as if everything he said was gospel. The Albert Finney character was the same way. To be metaphorically taken away by his fantasies was the greatest gift he could give. The only gift he had. And every one was a harmless, benevolent yarn that would live on after him. There are still times when one of my father's stories pops into my head and I have to regroup and rethink before I realized what a fabrication it was.",7,0,1,7 March 2006
The Insider," Tense from Beginning to End!
","I am often suspicious of docudramas because sometimes they take so many liberties with facts or revamp and combine events for their own purposes. Oliver Stone is frequently guilty of this. This film portrays an event that I remember like it was yesterday. The subtle portrayal of a man who must face the horrors of our modern age, disgrace, divorce, dishonor, and lack of health insurance, is right on and Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are incredible in their roles. It becomes a battle between the integrity of modern journalism, the entrenched tobacco industry, and whether one man can change anything. It is believable because this is the way it happened. There are even disclaimers at the end dealing with a couple of shady issues. I was also incredibly impressed by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Except for the voice, I almost felt he was there. I didn't even remember this film existed until I saw it recommended in a 'best of' list. I'm so happy I got to see something that really is for an adult viewer, not unlike 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' Keep these kinds of things coming.",10,1,1,19 January 2010
Quiz Show," An Intellectual Movie about an Intellectual
","I understand that a few liberties were taken with the facts in this film. They always are. The fundamentals of the quiz scandal of the fifties, however, did come through. This is a movie about men and their integrity. From Herbert Stempel to Charles Van Doren we have a range. These men were both geniuses, but Van Doren was the son of one of or great poets and critics and Stempel was just, well, Stempel. We idolize our pretty people (nothing new). Van Doren, of course, had to eventually face the music or face jail time. There were two golden ages of television. The first was when Milton Berle and his ilk caused people to put away everything early and watch each week. Jackie Gleason was also a part of this. The second began when TV began to exert its power. These big buck quiz shows were all over the place and the advertising revenue became phenomenal. How could one not begin to see the orchestration going on behind the scenes when such money began to speak loudly? Like the internet today, the media had moved beyond the legal system. One had to almost ask: Did anyone do anything illegal beyond the basic limits of fraud. And if they did, who was harmed by it?The performances are wonderful here. Rob Morrow, who should be doing a lot more, is excellent as the bulldog investigator. Ralph Fiennes comes across so well as Van Doren. He has that little snobby accent down cold. We want to hate him, but he is part of a great family and so automatically demands respect. John Turturro as Stempel is a juggernaut. He knows what they have done to him and he is really offended. He is crash and boorish and smart. Not what TV really wanted. The scandal plays itself out in a believable, realistic way that is so nice to see. If you want a movie that requires you to see the entire issue and make your own decision, see Quiz Show.",9,0,0,23 March 2006
The Dark Knight," I've Gone Batty!
","This movie has everything. The cameras, the sounds, the really cool characters. For me, it's one of few adventure movies worth watching more than once. And, of course, Heath Ledger is as awesome as everyone says. The characterization is so much deeper than the other films. We get to see multidimensional people with purpose, even if the purpose to to kill and maim. We care about what happens for a change and we go along for the ride. A small criticism is that it is awfully long and it takes so much time to resolve itself. Also, people do some pretty stupid things, considering what a threat this guy is. These are little things and without them we wouldn't have the huge finale.",9,2,7,12 January 2009
The Greatest Game Ever Played," A Nice Movie, Subtle and Believable
","I don't know a lot about the history of golf. I know the big guys like Bobby Jones and Ben Hogan. This movie is more about what led to Americans embracing the sport that was owned by the British Isles before that. The characters are very low key and gentlemanly. Watching the Masters after having seen the film, I love that there are still elements of a sport that go back to the beginnings. There are some loose cannons on the tour, but most of the golfers observe a code that keeps them on their best behavior. I was impressed by that tug between the aristocracy and those from humbler roots. This is a wonderful story about golf, but it's also a great human story. See it for the performances. One thing I wondered about. They apparently didn't have to mark a ball if it was in your line. There's a scene where the ball is popped over the other ball.",8,1,3,10 April 2007
Annie Hall," Woody's Best
","This has so many layers from intellectual humor to pratfalls. It has some of the most memorable characters in all of movie history. First of all, the script is full of what all comedy should be about: timing. The scenes where Annie and Alvy start their relationship are amazing. He, like his constant schmuck, has arrived at a place in his life, and even if he could change, he really doesn't want to. She is just starting to blossom, but carries around enough hangups to sink a battleship. He sees her beauty and her innocence, but can't pull himself out of growing up under a roller coaster. The scene with the lobsters, which he tries to reprise with another woman, and then he falls flat on his face. Her nutty family, particularly her brother, played by Christopher Walken. This was my first experience with one of the most wacko people in show business. At least his movie persona. Alvy is rooted in New York and that who California thing. The cocaine. The convertible with the destroyed top which he obviously tried to put up while he was cruising on the freeway. No one can present unrequited love as well as Woody. Every time I see him in his comic roles, I think, 'I really like him, but I would never want to be him.' There is a constipation in his characters but that's what makes it all work. You want them to be happy, but it's not in the cards.",10,3,4,8 March 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Few Random Comments
","So many  have commented, some quite scholarly.  There are few films that have been held up to such scrutiny as this one.  My reactions are emotional, although I think I could wade in the same waters as some of my predecessors. My approach to movies is to take them as they come.  I am so tired of all the talk about special effects that begin almost every review.  If you have a high profile film, the special effects are treated as if they are some a form unto themselves, as if they were actually removed from the film. Didn't like the special effects.  Didn't like the movie.  Sit down for a moment and look at this film.  It's wonderful that Kubrick was able to do what he did with those effects, but the way this movie unfolds is so  much more than that.  This movie is there to portray a sense of the awe of the universe and the future of humankind based on the increments that have led us there.  It is about a future that may occur.Everyone is talking about movie being a disappointment after reading the book.  Folks, the movie came out before the book.  The movie was originally based on a short story called 'The Sentinel' by Arthur C. Clarke.  The movie borrows some of its thoughtfulness from 'Childhood's End,' another Clarke book which deals with similar issues about the ends of humankind and the transmigration of our being.  If you are going to enjoy 2001, you have to put away that fixation on the conventional science fiction of the day, with foam rubber aliens and armies of extra-terrestrial implements of destruction.  Take a look at Star Wars sometime (by the way, I think it's a wonderful film).  It is really a space western, a World War II airplane movie, with a rite of passage thrown in, and the obligatory soap opera stuff with Luke and Darth Vader.  No-one can hit anything with laser weapons. Those storm troopers are the most worthless fighting force I have ever seen. It's a fun movie, but when you look at true speculative science fiction, there isn't much to think about, no metaphysics, nothing much to occupy your mind after its over.  2001 sets out to be different and shouldn't be compared to Star Wars; they are apples and oranges.  This movie has some of the most breath taking images that stand there in silent space, just getting a reaction.  If Independence Day is your thing and everything you see needs to copy it, don't bother to see this movie.",10,2,6,18 May 1999
Toy Story," As Good as It Gets!
","What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the 'humanity' of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.",10,5,6,3 January 2015
Blood Diamond," Is All This Really Happening?
","Lately, every film I see is so full of violence and suffering. Here the catch is diamonds and their impact on the world. Leonardo de Caprio is a mercenary, working the two sides against the middle. During this film, his character reclaims his soul. The strong suit of the film is the portrayal of the Africans who are victimized by the unfeeling diamond cartel and their own military infrastructure. It shows the process by which boys are kidnapped and then made into mindless soldiers fighting for a cause they don't even understand. I wish there had been a better sub-current of humanity and a little more human connection. I ask if this is the way it is or is it the way it is on the worst of days? What is truly astonishing is how the principle characters manage for so long to not get hit by fire. At times it's a bit much. Still, it sends a clear message that most of us ought to be aware of.",8,0,1,30 August 2010
The Graduate," The Voice of the Sixties
","So much has been written about this film. Enter Dustin Hoffman into the world of cinema with Benjamin Braddock, ready to enter adulthood. Out of college and feeling cut loose from the womb, he begins to live. Unfortunately, he is disenfranchised by his own ennui. His parents begin to worry about him and he lapses into withdrawal. To the rescue comes the inimitable Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his next door neighbor. The affair that follows is one of the most comedic in cinema history. There are some great lines and a kind of sexual byplay that is absolutely captivating. Anne Bancroft is sensational as the neighborhood vamp. Enter Katherine Ross, the nubile daughter of the aforementioned Mrs. Robinson, and Benjamin realizes that this is his true love. Throw in all that great music by Simon and Garfunkel and a series of amazing images (outstanding cinematography) and you have a film for the ages.",10,0,0,19 January 2015
Singin' in the Rain," All Together and in Pieces
","The story is a bit silly, but it's funny. I remember a diction coach in college, working with beautiful young women, to try to get them to pronounce the simplest words. This story revolves around this issue. It takes this simple plot and then explodes. Wonderful production numbers. Wonderful characters. Wonderful songs. Each one delivered in an imaginative way with incredible charm. The title tune is a part of Americana with Gene Kelley stomping through the gutters in on of the most incredibly choreographed moments ever. Also, the 'Good Mornin'' song is great. I could go on, but this is one of those movies that you can turn on any time and wait. It doesn't even matter if you see the rest of the movie. Each number can stand on it's own, but, more importantly, it progresses the story.",9,0,1,31 March 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Real Food for Thought
","This is a real mind bender (no pun intended). I really liked the premise because it opens up great implications for us all. How far are we from the manipulation of specific brain centers? We can already do a fair amount. The reality is that even if one can erase memories, we can't curtail the 'butterfly effect 'of our actions. We have trod the earth and the small or large changes we inspire, create something new. Now project love and romance, and, given time, let it percolate. You have Jim Carry and Kate Winslet being 'forced' back together because despite their minds, they never left. And if the memories were inconsequential in the larger picture, their remnants will continue to influence. Pretty thought provoking. We are more than our memories--we are part of the entire picture.",8,0,2,15 February 2006
Elysium," Star Trek on Steroids
","This is a decent movie. The story is an old one, dating back to Metropolis and in the not- to-distant past on Star Trek. A group of 'haves' have removed themselves from the 'have-nots' to a castle in the air. It is a self sustaining place where the lucky are able to live picket fence existences with little conflict. Unfortunately for them, there are people down on earth who are quite aware of their presence and would like a piece of the action. Matt Damon is a malcontent with a whole host of problems who finds himself the chosen one, through a series of events, not all of his own choosing. The movie is striking in that the world created visually defies the imagination. Unfortunately, there are so many holes in the plot, so much suspension of disbelief, that things just go too easily. Jody Foster is quite good as a sort of iron maiden who devotes her life to the status quo at any cost. Unfortunately, the infrastructure proves to be pretty fragile, considering how much effort and expense has been put into it. It is remindful of Mr. Spock disabling an entire planet by shooting at a single computer console. Backups and fail-safe systems seem to be lacking. Still it's a fun ride and keeps the audience in suspense.",7,0,3,3 January 2014
Taken," Even Action Films Need Some Sense of Reality
","The plot to this movie is nicely set up. It's very predictable but that doesn't matter. Once the young woman is kidnapped and the Terminator (Oops, Liam Neeson) gets involved, it slowly descends into an atrocious succession of easy kills with the hero being shot at about 20,000 times (not a scratch, of course) and each of his shots taking someone out. I thought this ended with Bronson and Death Wish 56. I don't know how the government ever let this guy go. He could wipe out a small country by himself. Then there is the physical toll. Dead people littering the streets and buildings. There is no humanity to any of them. Many of the people Neeson kills could well be just doing everyday jobs. It seems a shame that so much money can be expended on stuff like this. Neeson is one of our best actors. I hope he gets a few better offers.",3,8,16,9 March 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Visually Wonderful/Dumb Story
","Once again, someone takes a timeless story, with wonderful characters and a really cool plot and sells it out for a predictable, silly, action film, where the Mad Hatter becomes a love interest. Come on! The film begins with an amazing world created with great care. The images are almost startling in their lushness and complexity. So what happens. You take the Alice in Wonderland canon and take all the starch right out of it. Johnny Depp is great to look at, with his colors and his aberrant behavior. At some point, it all falls apart. A war between the white and red witches takes center stage. It is made obvious that Alice must fulfill her destiny by killing the Jabberwock. She begins to ally herself with benevolent forces. The queen who is visually interesting but really boring begins the 'off with her head' stuff. Anyway, by the time the thing was over, I just didn't care. I'm a firm believe in story and this one doesn't have an original bone in its body. How sad. And I really enjoy most of Tim Burton's output.",6,3,7,11 June 2010
The Mummy Returns," More of the Same but OK
","There are times when the cynical part of me gets put aside and I go to a movie to just see what happens. I decided that this time I would enjoy the special effects, the rules dreamed up by the Mummy experts, none of them ancient Egyptians, and just watch. There is really no plot, at least none of any importance. It is a series of events with some loose kind of contrived hierarchy of evil that needs to be addressed. It is pure video game stuff. Still, I watched it, admiring the incredible images put on the screen. The rapidity of motion. The critters that kept coming and coming. I looked at this like I look at a photograph and said, 'The people that did this are pretty darned creative.' Wouldn't it be nice if there was a bit of suspense and anticipation. We all know that you-know-who is going to meet you-know-who and according to the talk about the sequel, we know who's coming next. Anyway, I'm not going to put it down but I'm also not going to bother to watch it again.",6,0,0,19 September 2001
Avatar," OK You Got Me!
","This is a remarkable experience, like watching Niagara Falls. I am tired of special effects, but this has soul. Do the people that don't like the story resent the environmental vs. military part of it or what. Cameron has created a new race, a new language, and extrapolated a future. Of course he borrows from other sources. The last original thing I read was by Marshall McLuhan in 1964. Anyone who writes anything epic borrows from the ancient Greeks for God's sake. This is full of spectacle, 'humanity,' and tension. The alien culture is greatly developed. I'm surprised that Anne McCaffrey fans aren't complaining. Yes, there are dragons and they bond with their masters. The final battle scene is incredible. We have a great GI Joe villain, and invalid set free from his infirmity by sloughing into a new body, a cool scientist with a harsh edge (Sigourney Weaver) and a theme that things aren't as simple as we would hope they would be. I saw this in 3D and found it to be wonderful. Still, while I seldom see a movie a second time in the theater, I will go to this again and watch it in its standard format. I think it might be a bit more liberating.",9,2,10,12 January 2010
Toy Story 2," The Boys Are Back in Town
","All three Toy Story movies are wonderful. The second continues to feature the adventures of Woody and his sojourn in the greater world. Once he is kept home because of an arm 'injury,' he finds himself taken away (quite through an accident) and set to be placed in a toy museum. He gets wanderlust as he imagines himself immortal. But what is not there is his friend Andy who left him behind. Soon his friends come to 'rescue' him because they see what is happening to him. They also come to realize that there is villainy afoot from a man who has a financial interest in him. What happens is that Woody must be rescued from himself as much as the bad guy. I thought the first movie was amazing, but the second is a worthy sequel.",10,1,3,2 January 2017
Selma," There's Probably a Lot Better Versions of the King Story
","Once one gets used to the fact that the film of the original events in Selma, Alabama, is more interesting than this fictionalized piece, it starts to become a disappointment. The young man who plays Martin Luther King, Jr., does a decent job, but there is something lacking. When we hear speeches by King, there is a power to his delivery. Something is missing here. While a British actor plays King and he does great with a southern American, his delivery lacks the punch. What makes the movie worthwhile is the portrayal of the marches, all three of them. The first is so graphic in its violence as those marshals block the area on the other side of the bridge. Also missing is lively dialogue among the leaders of the movement. They are so stiff where they should be fighting among each other, expressing their fears and bringing us into the process. Lyndon Johnson is seen as the bad guy (along with, of course, George Wallace), but his portrayal is stilted. Where is that Texas accent. He is so impressed in our minds. There should be more bluster and casual dominance in this figure. While this is a decent rendering of a major event in the development of man's quest for freedom, it falls a bit flat.",7,13,25,19 January 2015
The Artist," Ingenious but Lightweight
","So, let's make a silent movie. We have all the state-of-the-art stuff that allows us to fall back on something that disappeared around 1929. It disappeared because Jolson talked and others couldn't and we were on our way to what we have now. The limitations of cinematography created in silents demands that were hard to overcome at times, but through genius, the likes of Griffith and Murnau were able to trump those with varying degrees of success. Some of the best of these were silly comedies and, hence, that's what we have here. What we've asked it what the actors of the new sound era were asked, except in reverse. This is hardly a true silent movie. Because of the huge budget and the ability use techniques that are tried and true, it comes off slick as a whistle. I really enjoyed this but let's face it, not only as the technology passed, so has the era that spawned it. So by making this a period piece, I can only respond ho-hum. I think this is a creative piece with nice acting and some cool plot twists (though a little too much pride for my tastes), but I feel that the other Best Picture nominees should be suing.",8,2,4,19 September 2012
Invictus," Bland Retelling
","Having read extensively about the situation in South Africa and being a great admirer of Mandela, I was disappointed in this film. Yes, Morgan Freeman looks like and acts like the great president. Yes the events are portrayed in a relatively accurate way. It's just that there doesn't seem to be a great dramatic question. Nothing is portrayed on the edge like they need to be. The racial issue is there but it is pretty sanitized and almost cute at times. There are also some silly tricks that I won't mention because they would be spoilers. There are two ways to go with this biographical stuff. You can go all the way and get down and dirty (like the issues in Coetzee's 'Disgrace'), or you can make it a moral tale with little taking place. The Rugby team needed some life and some real tension. There had to be more internal strife than that portrayed in this film. When it was over, my response was, 'OK! Apartheid ended. What is the aftermath?' It isn't even quite there when it comes to sport. I also would like to have seen a little more explanation about the tension between Mandela and his daughter.",7,0,1,31 July 2010
La La Land," A Really Pleasant Experience
","It's so nice that someone was willing to produce an original musical that wasn't animated. Emma Stone and Ryan Goslin light up the screen. The songs are very well written and fit well within the parameters of the romance that develops. I think the people that are so angry about the hype this film has gotten forget that the musicals it mimics had pretty basic plots. Oh, so it's the worst film of the year! Really? This is a story about dreams and hopes and trying to achieve them in an environment where the chances are really slim. The production numbers are sappy to be sure, but that's what this kind of offering puts to us. It tells us that we can just have fun and root for the characters.",9,2,16,7 January 2017
Super 8," No New Ground; But Well Done!
","I know that little new material was presented in this film. We have become so jaded with all the special effects available. If the computer people get a little carried away, it soon begins to detract from the central flow of the plot. This is why foreign films are, for the most part, better than American films. When you don't have the bells and whistles available, you have to actually tell a good 'story.' This movie, however, is a cut above most of the others of its ilk because I really did begin to care about the characters. Also, having been a middle-school teacher for forty years, I found the goofiness and charm of the kids to be pretty believable. Granted, the deck is stacked because they all have issues. Not every quartet of young people automatically includes four levels of dysfunction. Still, the actors are out of the ET mode, in that they seem to act in a somewhat real way, considering the circumstances. I agree, however, that the military is up to no good and that is old hat. Also, why are the aliens so typically reptilian. I wish the creators could come up with something new. Finally, the first two-thirds are really captivating but the final third can't maintain it. It's still worth the time.",7,0,1,27 May 2012
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Strike While the Iron Is Hot
","This is the typical Hollywood effort to capitalize quickly on a financial success. It's not that there isn't some fun here, but everything seems much more contrived. Of course, the fact that Kevin is left behind again is the first contrivance. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern are now the 'Sticky Bandits' and are out of jail. The family is in New York and things begin to fall apart. Of course, what this is really about, is how much abuse one can inflict on the two idiots as they try to pull off a huge heist. Add the elements of their actions affecting poor children and the appearance of the bird lady in Central Park, we have efforts to pull at our heartstrings. Things ring hollow, mainly because the first movie did this well and this one didn't. There is one nice part of this movie and that is the byplay between Culkin and the irrepressible Tim Curry, the receptionist at the Plaza Hotel. I never miss anything Curry is in because he sparkles with evil joy. Watch this movie to see Curry. I have determined I will never invest on minute in Home Alone III.",7,0,1,2 January 2015
Up," Sweet Film With Memorable Characters!
","I immediately fell for this film. I think my favorite moment in the whole thing is when he meets Ellie for the first time. She is one of a kind and the animators did a lovely job of making her eternally beautiful. It has one of the most touching moments I've seen in any film. Then, of course, we need to suspend out disbelief, thinking that a house, propelled by helium balloons, can be raised from the ground, becoming airborne. What follows is a truly great story. We have a young Wilderness Scout who has all the hangups of modern youth, clueless in so many ways. We have a cast of incredible dogs who have been given the ability to speak through a device invented by the villain of the movie. There are complex relationships that transcend the usual kid plots. This one works to the end. Some people ask too many questions. While this movie is about science, we should not read too much into it. Just suffice it to say, it is full of adventure, close calls, bonding, and, of course, true love. I really believe this is one of the better films of this past year.",9,0,1,19 January 2010
A Clockwork Orange," We Are Seeing Our Future
","Having read Anthony Burgess's novel years ago and working my way through the amazingly creative, futuristic dialogue, I really looked forward to seeing the movie. It was not a disappointment. In the hands of Stanley Kubrick, it comes to life. It is the product of the desensitized world that we see unfolding before us in the beginning of the 21st century. There will be a lot of Alexes in the future; there already are. We are slowly moving away from conventional morality and playing with forms of nihilism. Our politics are beginning to diminish the individual rights and safety of our citizens. Our young people are beginning to band together in little covens, the cell phone and the computer creating little worlds where anonymity can lead to diminution of what is good. Pardon my diatribe, but what Alex and his droogs are doing isn't all that out of the ordinary these days. The manipulative, controlling, anything for 'me' society is just being formed. Kubrick and Burgess had a a vision. Sometimes this movie is called science fiction. The only science fiction thing about it is that it takes place in the future. The violence we see is the violence of those who no longer care what that word means. This whole world is more frightening than the terrorists we see behind every rock. This enemy is us; or the us yet to be.",9,0,3,14 March 2006
Woman in Gold," A Fascinating Case--Movie a Bit Bland
","I have to say that I enjoyed this film, but mostly for the subject matter, a court case that took place in 1998. We have for some time been made aware again of the Nazi's efforts to steal the great art of the world, particularly Western art. Movies like 'The Monument Men' depict efforts to recover what they stole from the heart of the world. For this they can never be forgiven. The majority of these pieces have never been found. Fortunately, many of the works were kept in museums or in private residences and so were intact. This is the story of a piece that became known as the Austrian Mona Lisa. Helen Mirren is Maria Altman whose family owned the great portrait known as the Woman in Gold. When she finds some letters that tell of the story of the painting, she enlists a young Randy Schoenberg, the grandson of the great composer, to make a case for the return of the painting to its rightful heirs. Predictably, they wade through all the roadblocks, assisted by a young Austrian journalist. I have to agree with the reviews that talk about the good guys and the bad guys. I love Austria, especially Vienna, but here they are portrayed so harshly that we have little sympathy for their position. Ryan Reynolds is a little short on effort here, sort of phoning it in. But there are enough twists and turns and Mirren is great fun to watch to make it well worthwhile. I plan on seeing how realistic the portrayal was.",8,1,2,12 January 2017
Groundhog Day," A Soul Reclaimed
","This movie is so charming. It starts out with Phil Connor, the Bill Murray character, doing his Bill Murray. Cynicism emanating from every pore. He is harsh, disinterested, angry, full of angst. Making jokes about everything. Everybody knows it. Everybody feels it. When the 'gift' or 'curse' comes to him to relive the same day over and over, he at first is confused, then flippant, then angry, then suicidal, and, finally, sees it as a chance to reclaim his humanity. This is done in a series of repetitious acts which ultimately lead to his willingness to sacrifice himself, live for the day, and try to show that he is worth saving. What this movie does, like 'It's a Wonderful Life,' is ask us what we would do, given the same circumstances. Would we fall into a retreat of depression? Would we become something that we always wanted to be? Would we keep living it the same way, hoping for he best? Murray's character wants the romance and the commitment that he was never willing to give. He toys with his own approach to the world, experimenting and doing things until he gets them right. He goes through a period of embracing the bad, lusting after Andy MacDowell, forcing himself on the other women in the town, disdaining the 'characters' he meets. But like most 'everymen,' he eventually must become good because without that, it doesn't matter anymore.He can only impress so much; he can only be angry so long. I find this movie so intriguing, not for what it says but for what it teaches. Some don't like the ending, but whatever the forces are that bring it about, it has to be. If we accept that premise, it's OK.",9,1,3,23 October 2001
National Treasure," Just too much to handle
","This is a big splashy movie, full of chases and escapes. It takes a page from books like 'The DaVinci Code.' Our national treasures are clues to more profound things. Those Freemasons are at it again. The theft of the Declaration of Independence should be easy; like breaking into Fort Knox. I just wish that more effort was made to explain how a bunch of buffoons are guarding this national treasure, where a guy with a phony copy can exchange it. I don't dislike the movie; I just want the writers to make it more complex. Cage, whom I really like as an actor, and his cohorts dance around, trying to find this deep dark secret. Where did they get so much expertise? I know about the original document that leads to their efforts, but there are things like secret compartments, anti theft devices, armed guards who know what they are doing. Then there are the bad guys. Why are they there? How did they just happen to show up? It's because you need someone other than the federal government to be the adversary. Someone with motives like yours, trying to get at the stash, before you.I did enjoy the theater experience because I was in the mood for a big adventure movie. But at the end, I wasn't on the edge of my seat like I should have been. And a few days later, it became pretty forgettable. It's too bad we can't remake movies and work a few of the weaknesses.",7,1,1,6 April 2006
Reservoir Dogs," Pardon Me While I Bleed!
","I've been trying to see a lot of seminal films when possible. This is one that had me turning my head from time to time because of all the gore and disregard for human life. It starts with this great restaurant scene, Diner on steroids, where Steve Buscemi proves to be the selfish, cheap SOB that he plays throughout the film. I could watch this guy and his neurotic tics forever. I love films that put us at a point in time and then reconstruct the events leading up to it. Add to this, career criminals, some of whom are totally lacking in conscience. We have Harvey Keitel who is one of our greatest actors playing character with a little moral sense. He wants to find a little good. The characters all go by colors so they won't be able to identify each other if they are captured. Again, Buscemi gets into one of his gratuitous discussions when it is decided that he will be Mr. Pink. There is so much violence here, but the movie is at times funny and outrageous in a really insane way. Each guy is a powder keg and they maneuver for position. And, of course, there is 'the scene.' I really like the taut nature of this film, a mere 100 minutes. It moves neatly to its conclusion (well, perhaps, 'neatly' isn't the best word), and things are tied up well in the end. Despite the huge amount of violence, I can see why people gravitate toward this film.",9,1,2,28 January 2010
Love & Mercy," In the Head of a Genius
","I'm trusting that this is an accurate portrayal of a tragic drift into psychosis. Brian Wilson who really is/was the Beach Boys heard voices. Some drove him to his knees; others helped him write some really great music. There's a place where he is asked by his brother if he thinks he is Mozart. Had he been writing in that time period, he may have been another Mozart. Rising out of the repression of his father, Brian never felt good enough. He sought approval from the worst of sources. He also made the boys so successful, with huge amounts of money coming in. But like the true artist, he finally found the sound stale and futureless. As his self esteem waned more and more, he fell under the control of an over bearing, ambitious doctor. This man not only misdiagnosed him, he put him on a regimen of dangerous drugs. During his later years, Brian (now played by John Cusack) meets a beautiful woman at a car dealership. He is buying a car and is immediately attracted to her. They begin a weird relationship as she hangs on to him when he is at his weirdest. He continues to be abused by his doctor and a whole series of events occur. There is an excellent flipping back and forth between the young and old Brian Wilson as we are made privy to what he dealt with because of his gifts. My favorite scenes were in the studio when he would insist on thirty or forty takes to get things just so. Meanwhile, the rest of the gang rolled their eyes and pounded their fists. Having grown up with these guys, this was an eye opener. Well done.",9,2,3,8 January 2016
Rocky," What's Not to Like
","Rocky is the consummate boxing movie. But it's also the story of a man who had pretty much wasted his life. Sylvester Stallone's boxer has thick head and a good heart. He depends on other to kind of look out for him. Unfortunately, he has worked with crooks because it's the only living he knows. He does hard manual labor. He likes to box and because he is intense, he catches the eye of the world champion. He gets a gig as a sparring partner and eventually a fight with the champ, Apollo Creed. Of course, it's a circus. Because Rocky is not bright, Creed is able to abuse him emotionally. Rocky is a bruiser, taking as many hits as he gives. Not a good way to have a future. There are subplots, involving MIck (Burgess Meredith) and Pauley (who is disrespectful of his sister Adrian) and then there is the romance developing between Rocky and Adrian. What happens is that Creed thinks Rocky is a joke while Rocky begins to train seriously for the first time in his life. What eventually happens is one of the best choreographed fights in all of cinematic history. A masterful movie.",10,2,3,20 December 2016
Shine," Geoffrey Rush's Tour de Force
","This is a marvelous bio-pic of a man who suffers throughout life for his art. David Helfgott, an Australian, is a wunderkind pianist who is abused and betrayed by his father, and robbed of his childhood. It is sort of the classic smothering that takes place when a sensitive artist loses his soul for a time. Eventually, Helfgott gets to perform but finds himself immersed in schizophrenia and mental illness for years. The world lost him for a time. But there's more to the story. Geoffrey Rush, whom I had never heard of at the time, is brilliant as the damaged artist. He expresses the deep depression of the character and his genius. The film is able to show the darkness of the soul through its cinematography. The film is inspiring but only because of its portrayal of pain",10,0,0,7 January 2017
Beauty and the Beast," More Aces Than a Stacked Deck
","Once again, I see people getting so personal with a mere film. The animated 'Beauty and the Beast' is in my top ten Disney movies. It has charm and color and some really great singing. It is a tremendous story, based on an unforgettable fairy tale. So, as is the case with other films, there was a Broadway version made and it has become as successful as just about any other musical. All that said, I'm astonished by all the people giving this film a rating of 'one.' It has incredible special effects, great costuming, glorious sound. Most of the characters seem to work just fine. I would have cast someone besides Emma Watson as Belle, but she holds her own. There are times when the pacing drags a bit, but it stays on serve much of the time. I liked Kevin Kline as Maurice. He is always solid in his roles. I did find the conclusion quite disappointing. It didn't have that cathartic effect it should have. But it's far from a terrible movie.",7,2,6,18 June 2017
Departures," Heartfelt
","This is one of those films that just grows on you. It starts out as a study of a young Japanese family that is facing an uncertain future with optimism. When the young man answers an ad in the employment section of the local newspaper and sees the word Departures, he assumes the job to be with a travel agency. What he ends up doing is preparing the recently departed for a ceremonial cleansing in front of the families. Apparently, even though a significant part of the burial (actually cremation) process, these people are frowned upon by their peers. Even the resilient wife of the young man finds what he does repulsive and leaves him for a time. As with all great movies, this is about redemption and characterization and it allows us to follow the career of one who expresses great love and respect for the dead. I was stunned at the overall tenderness of this film.",9,2,3,11 October 2010
Pretty Woman," Contrived Romantic Effort
","I agree with the writer who talked about Julia Roberts' role as a prostitute. She has none of the look of one who sells her body for a living. We have the beautiful young actress who is pretty normal, perhaps more normal than your average woman of her age. Along comes handsome Richard Gere. He takes on the task of cleaning her up. He has all the money he needs to do whatever he wants as it regard this young woman. Of course, she is a bit coarse, but she is a little hard to believe. There seems to be no regret or disdain for where she comes from. She also seems to be an independent contractor. Anyway, it is a formulaic love story that we all know will come to a proper conclusion. Roberts is absolutely beautiful. Gere was at the peak of his marquee good looks. This really set Roberts off as a leading lady. It's a fun movie.",7,1,2,29 December 2016
Some Like It Hot," Tony Curtis Bugs Me; I Love Him in This Fillm
","Jack Lemmon has the most bewildered, frantic sensibility about him. And in this film he is able to use it to the Nth degree. Tony Curtis has always been a puzzle to me, but the chemistry that he exhibits with Lemmon makes this the biggest hoot of the fifties. Throw in Marilyn Monroe, with her dizzy blond routine, but with charm, and gentleness, and you have an unstoppable comedy. With the men in drag attempting to invade the place where the girls are and Joe E. Brown (a very strange man to say the least) and a great script and it really works. I will never forget the final line of the movie as Lemon sits next to Brown with the most incredulous look. See this if you haven't it will make you laugh from beginning to end.",9,0,0,3 December 2016
Inside Man," Just a Tad Smug!
","This is a decent but not particularly memorable movie. I thought that Denzel Washington was pretty good, but he seems to have settled into a type. Confident and unyielding and always right (Coach Boone from Remember the Titans). This is fine and I enjoy watching him. This movie is about a bank robbery where the perpetrators are after more than money. It has to do with a righteous cause, but what happens is that the possibility of pulling it off and getting what they want is on such fragile ground that you need to ask the question, 'Isn't there an easier way?' Anyway, the scenes in the bank are quite good but we really need to extend our disbelief at times. I've always wondered about that 'get me a plane and a million dollars' business anyway. Well, there's a lot more to it than that. See this and enjoy the characters, but in the long run, it's pretty far fetched.",7,2,2,9 March 2010
Hoosiers," Captures Its Time Period
","I like good sports movies. There is a delicate touch involved in making them work. As a child, my friends and I would read every sports book we could get our hands on and we were very critical of the authors. I remember a basketball book where a team that was fouled declined the foul and kept the ball. This was the end of that author as far as we were concerned. We were pretty picky. I started watching basketball in fourth grade which would have been about three years after the time of this movie. When I looked at the portrayal of the players in the movie I was impressed. The old gym, the cars heading to the visitors' town on a Friday night, the whole town completely involved, mainly because there was nothing else to do. Then, of course, it was Indiana. I couldn't begin to understand that since we never got that serious.I will go to a Gene Hackman film and assume it will be above average. I really like his portrayal of the coach. He has incredible baggage as he hits the small town and is past the time when he needs to just please people. He is complex and proud and knows deep down inside that this team isn't going anywhere unless there is a commitment. The townspeople want a lot of scoring. He wants discipline. This of course causes him to get into a war with the townies. He even throws one of the better players off the team. Of course, there's the subplot of getting the young phenom to come back to the team and the romance angle. But ultimately it is the way basketball was in the fifties. Hackman takes his character, which has many failings, and throws it into the soup. He's a master craftsman as an actor. See this.",8,0,0,27 February 2006
Pulp Fiction," One of the Funniest Movies Ever
","It took fifteen years and a subscription to Netflix to finally get around to seeing this film. It was well worth the wait. If all one were to see is the byplay between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, it would be worth the price of admission. But this is only part of the incredible effect this film has. I don't even like gore in movies; I avoid it. But Tarentino weaves a culture of violence where there is actual humanity. We care about these bad guys. There is scene after scene of people being pushed to the limit. The very idea that the boxer, played by Bruce Willis, would risk everything to retrieve a watch that has been transported on two occasions, shove up someone's ass, is amazing. And very, very funny. I can't begin to list all the wonderful scenes. The opening dialogue is incredible as Trovolta and Jackson are on their way to do a hit. They have virtually no respect for human life, yet they, themselves, are very human. The date scene with Uma Thurman with the adrenaline shot. The crazy's in the pawn shop. And, the effort to clean up the car after blowing away a kid in the back seat, the issue being that a guys wife would come home and be very unhappy to find a dead body and a blood filled car in the garage. It sounds horrible and makes me sound sick. I found Fargo to be a hilarious film as well. Is there something wrong with me?",10,4,9,7 December 2009
Les Misérables," Quite Well Don, But......
","I'm at odds with myself. Did I like this movie because it is a really good movie, or am I so wired into the music that I'm no longer objective. When the 25th anniversary video came out, I couldn't wait to get it. I was not disappointed. I had seen the stage play a couple times and listened to the Original Cast album countless times. The concert was terrific. If I had to, I'd say I would prefer it to this movie. Yet it is apples and oranges. Les Miserables has been done so many times, but in dramatic form. There are relatively new versions as well as the 1940's version. My eighth grade teacher played a piece of one of them called 'The Bishop's Candlesticks' where Jean Valjean commits his life to paying back the old man. We had read this chapter and it was kind of cool to talk about. This is a very nice version of both play and musical. It is stunningly visual, recreating the world of the rebels, trying to face off against insurmountable odds. The casting here is excellent, though I wonder how these people would handle the theatre stage. Anne Hathaway is probably one of the saddest presences in all of movie history. She sings the saddest of songs and hands the raising of her daughter to a man she barely knows. Russell Crowe is Javert and he sings with emotion and intensity (though much less operatic than the role usually is). Hugh Jackman has the versatility to play the man who must face his god and pay a price to the law. He has a very nice voice though at times it's hard to imagine him aging as he does. I looked forward to this film and I felt good about seeing it. There is spectacle and fear; everything is truly operatic. It worked for me.",9,6,11,22 January 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Somewhat Disappointing and Confusing
","I think the books are fun. They get into issues of art and secret societies going back ages. I'll admit that Dan Brown misses the point sometimes on some of his set-ups. But like most fiction, especially the genre he belongs to (I will throw in the likes of Preston & Childs), there are liberties taken. I'd like to know where those places in Game of Thrones are on our earth. Silly. Well. There is no scientific or historical accuracy in these films. The author created a world where evil has existed for centuries and he makes up a situation where this evil must be circumvented. I think what has happened here is because Dan Brown is not considered a fantasy writer, his work gets attacked as if her were a scholar. That trickles down to the movies and makes people so emotional. I liked the review by the woman and her boyfriend who had never read the book. They were willing to let their prejudices go. I didn't care much for the sequels, but there are other reasons for that. I think Hanks was quite adequate and the move is reasonable.",7,0,0,9 January 2017
Titanic," It's About People
","It's hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It's a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I'm not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling 'all right' when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it's just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn't really grab me. What did was that there was a hopelessness beyond anything we can fathom. If you read my review of 'A Night to Remember,' also a fine film from much earlier, you will see that it's about people saying goodbye to their wives and children and to another day that makes this event so horrible. It's quite a marvelous movie. We may have forgotten that in the wake of all the attention it received, including parodies and spoofs.",9,1,2,28 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Charming and Endearing!
","How sad it is to begin the reader's comments with a whining, complaining, drone against everything about this movie. Why not pick a balanced view. Good grief! Did someone poison your dog? It made it sound like this doesn't compare favorably with 'Hamburger: The Movie.' I am a over fifty years old and thought I would be pretty lukewarm to a 'kids' movie. I have been listening for a year to kids raving about the Harry Potter books. Their eyes light up--they are enthused about a 'book.' When I went to see it, I had just read the book the night before because I like to see how they translate. The script was delightful. The characters were charming. The acting in this movie is wonderful--were you expecting Bergman? The pacing is delightful. The sets are eerie and forbidding. I thought that the wonderment of the characters was there in full force. Who did you have in mind to play Harry? Are there any actors that you approve of? Perhaps Kevin Spacy should have played Harry. How about the blond girl from American Beauty as Hermione. Johnny Depp as Ron Weasley. Oh yeah--as I recall, Stephen Spielberg has made a couple of pretty decent movies.We are introduced to the Harry Potter canon as he becomes a foundling, taken into a family that mistreats him and has no respect for his general goodness. Of course, they pay a price for their insensitivity and Harry takes the magical journey to enroll at Hogwarts. It is obvious that his coming has great import for everyone. He meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and they begin a quest to locate the Sorcerer's Stone. We find out about Voldemort and the curse that hangs over Hogwarts, going back centuries. We are also introduced to Quiddich which will be a staple for all episodes. Harry also must struggle with what happened to his parents and, like Frodo in 'Lord of the Rings,' his quest and what it means. Outstanding film.",9,0,0,28 November 2001
In Time," Bonnie and Clock
","This movie is fine if you don't think too much. First of all, there is the fundamental premise that one can use time as currency. Who decided that at 25 years of age the denizens of the future, would die unless the begged, borrowed, or stole time. We are never given that explanation but all people have a sort of countdown clock on their forearms. Those who have accumulated time become hunted by those who wish to steal it. There is also a set of sectors where people have as much time as they want. Everyone stops aging at 25 and either dies or maintains that age (hence mothers may be 100 years old and look just like their 25 year old children). Also, a grasp of the wrist of another person can transfer time. Justin Timberlake is given a huge cache of time by a suicidal man and sets out to avenge the death of his mother, who has succumbed before she can get 'reloaded.' He takes a spoiled young woman with him and they go around blowing up the system. They are pursued by a sort of latter day Javert, who has dedicated his miserable life to being a timekeeper, arresting those poor souls who are just trying to live. Anyway, it's all pretty absurd, unless you look at it as a parody of our own grasping society and our social classes. Pretty far fetched, even if disbelief is suspended.",6,0,1,1 September 2015
Thor," Way Up North
","I have been dragged through the Marvel milieu by my son. Contrary to my snobbish initial prejudices, I have enjoyed these quite a bit. This one, of course, sets the stage for the appearance of Thor, the hammer-wielding hunk, who is striving top prove himself worthy of becoming king in the upper-world, possibly displacing Anthony Hopkins' Odin at some point. The fly in the ointment (actually there are several) is his sort of half brother, Loki, whose face reminds me of a hybrid of Brent Spiner and Pee Wee Herman. He is really full of the Dickens and totally amoral, especially after finding out a secret which I will not divulge. The strength of this film is that it does a very nice job of storytelling, despite it's ignorance of real Norse mythology. Nobody cares. We understand the powers of the characters, we like the romance between mortal and demi-god, the main character is charming though violent, and the movie has a sense of humor, where we can be allowed to take a breath at times. And there are unanswered questions, which have us waiting for the next adventure. Unfortunately for me, I've seen these things all out of order, so I try to evaluate them on their individual merits. I had a nice time.",8,0,1,3 December 2013
Three Colors: Blue," What Is It Like to Be Submerged in Grief?
","This film is about the most raw of emotions, grief from great loss. In an opening scene, the brakes go out on a car, ridden in by Juiette Binoche, the result of which is the loss of her composer husband and her young daughter. We now focus on her attempted recovery which begins with a suicide attempt. Once out of the hospital, she wallows in grief. She obviously has the funds to go on which allows her to drop out of her previous world. Her husband had been respected all over the world for his work, but it is implied that she had as much to do with the work as he did. One of her husband's associates (who has loved her and sleeps with her one evening) wants to finish the master's final composition. She destroyed a copy earlier, but it resurfaced as a copy in his desk at his workplace. As she tries to get direction, she finds out deep secrets that were kept. She has a relationship with an exotic dancer in a sex club. There are rather obvious scenes of her swimming alone, going into the depths of the water and coming out. This is quite an intense, but superbly quiet film.",9,0,0,6 February 2016
The Shape of Water," Some People Are Missing the Boat
","When it comes to Del Toro, we know we are going to get a dose of weird. We will also get some fine filmmaking. The cinematography, the presentation of danger is heavy. This is another one of those cold war stories where a nautical creature is captured and kept in a tank. He has human like features. For some reason, it is decided by the evil military complex that this fellow be destroyed. The Russians fear that somehow survival of the creature puts them in danger, so they want him done in as well. Meanwhile, a young woman who is an orphan and a mute, seems to have an unexplainable attraction to this being. She manages to set up an escape and brings him to her apartment above a movie theater. There is a federal agent who is blamed for the escape. He is the real monster in the film. What transpires over the second half is very strange. There is a wait time to get our creature into friendly waters. I won't add any spoilers here. I think people who are criticizing this film, weren't listening to several key hints. I thought it was a delight. The only real criticism for me is the over the top ugly violence perpetrated by the Americans and the Russians.",9,27,51,29 January 2018
Mystic River," Sparks Fly
","A movie of great pain and complexity. It takes the suffering of each character and winds it up a notch. The ugly opening scene of the sexual assault (even though not on screen) is something that every one of us can understand. For that child to be dumped back into his neighborhood, first as a victim, then a pariah, is really sad. These boys become men and husbands and fathers. They wear their violence on their sleeves. They don't respect--they strike out--without thought. Others back away. Some say the acting is a little overdone--but that would make Brando's performance in 'Streetcar' overdone. Everyone is wound so tightly. There are several scenes that are so riveting, the death of Sean Penn's daughter at the top of the list. Penn's reaction is so memorable, as is the subdued performance of Kevin Bacon's homicide cop. As the the angst and tension build to a conclusion, we want these guys to find some happiness. Unfortunately, the die is cast in this gut wrenching film. Clint Eastwood at his best.",8,1,2,1 March 2006
Zombieland," Not Your Garden Variety Zombie Movie!
","My son rented this movie. I remember seeing a clip of Woody Harrelson's performance somewhere and decided to take a gander. This is a a wonderful, tongue in cheek (if you'll excuse the expression), outrageous film with cute performances, lots of charm, and a positive slant that seems impossible under the circumstances. The story is about a young man who is stuck alive as the entire world collapses around him. Ninety-nine percent of the population has become the walking (or running) dead. He has a set of rules for staying alive that he uses without fail and this gets him from one day to another. He meets Woody Harrelson, a true character, who is loaded for bear. They also hook up with a couple of sisters who steal their weapons and their car on several occasions. The relationship among these four is priceless and we really care about them. Then, there is Bill Murray. I won't say more. This film was totally off the radar, but was so much better than most of what I have seen lately.",8,0,0,14 April 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," A Wonderful Film with a Cutting Edge
","Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included.  It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things.  George Bailey is in trouble.  He has decided to end it all.  The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle.  George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities.  There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene.  George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll.  He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living.  He has gifts he doesn't realize.  He has family.  He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is.  Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it.  His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over.  His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank.  George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously.  It can be painful to watch sometimes.  The best scenes are the ones where George never existed.  His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher.  When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others.  They are superb.  It's a question all of us have wrestled with: 'What if we had never existed?'  There is no peer in Capra's canon.  I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage.  We need to see things as they should be.  I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts.  This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place.",10,1,5,4 October 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Who's Worse. Hitler or Stalin?
","This is about the most awful results of war. There could be no more gut level fighting than that which took place between the Russians and the Nazis. This film is quite striking just for its war scenes. The Russians have so much resolve and they truly wore down the German machine. I'm sure that given a place at the Russian front terrified most German soldiers. Krueschev comes off ass despicable. Like most in authority, he is fine with sending wave after wave to be cannon fodder and then spends his time intimidating those who haven't' made that sacrifice. The boss, Stalin's, presence is in every scene. Jude Law's sniper is just a cog. Heroism really counts for nothing. The only result is getting the German's out of Stalingrad and turning the tide. Imagine the dehumanizing of this man. It makes the point again what a waste of lives, property, and human spirit war is. It sets back humanity every time.",8,2,5,20 April 2010
A Beautiful Mind," A great character study.
","Ron Howard is certainly a prize. There is such a danger when one plays with the audience's sense of reality, that things will become so confusing as to destroy any consistent engagement. The story of John Nash is remarkable. First of all, we have this brilliant man, this genius. He carries on daily discourse and is a success in every endeavor. However, underlying everything is the hallucinatory world of his disease. How do you respond to the correct reality when there are so many. How do you go on when you know that some of the people you speak with aren't real; that some of the issues dominating your life are objects of paranoia and fear. Howard and Crowe pull this off in full view of the audience. When the movie is over, we understand. Then there is the fact that there are people who wake up every morning and face the type of day that this man does. If he were a raving lunatic it would be one thing. But he continues to make his way through life. Those around him are constantly off balance because they have to recognize that what he says may have not foundation.

","After really being charmed by the first film, I now begin to see more of the darkness and seriousness of these movies. I read and enjoyed the first book, but haven't got the wherewithal to continue to read them. I've decided to rely on the movies. This one takes us to a new level with interesting new characters and, especially, villains. Those who were exposed in the first movie are now developed and a part of the pattern Harry and his pals share. Hogwarts and environs becomes even more amazing and puzzling. The long shots, especially, are so very creative. We find out as each movie comes along that Harry is fallible and must face his fears without much help. This leads to a real empathy with him. There are so many superheroes frequenting the movies these days. Many are pretty tiresome. Their stories lack character. Harry, of course, is a wizard, but he is always becoming. Not being a Potterfile, I am going to have to remain a charmed observer. I think this is a wonderful series and look forward to seeing them all.After encountering the ever threatening Voldemort, Harry now has a new task. Somewhere in the past the Slitherins, influenced by an evil wizard, kept a monster in a secret place. The purpose of his being there was at some point to decimate the school, sending all non 'pureblood' students packing (or even killing them). Harry and his friends must find out what happened back then and move to find the person whose destiny it is to release the monster. There are some great scenes her, beginning with Harry being picked up by the Weasley boys and being brought to Hogwarts in a most dangerous manner. Malfoy and his father become bigger threats than they were in the first film and lay the groundwork for a future confrontation. Hagred is sent off to prison for a time, falsely accused, and Dumbledore comes under suspicion. The episode ends in an incredibly clever way, setting the stage for more uncovering of Harry's role in what is thrust upon him.",9,0,2,14 February 2006
The Departed," Whom Do You Trust?
","Wow, this was exhausting. We have a cast of characters, each of which has a dangerous side. They are woven into a complex network of crime and honor. Some are spies; some are mobsters; some are weak; and some are strong. The one thing that fills the screen is no one knows when it's coming. There is so much danger out there and it could be around any corner. The performances are great, particular by Jack Nicholson and Mark Walberg. These are a couple of crazies who seem to enjoy the most insane, continuous process of interaction among crooks and police. They are suspicious and ruthless and absolutely great. The down side is having a hell of a lot of sympathy for anyone. Leonardo DeCaprio's character is probably the most sympathetic but we know the fine line he is walking and that disturbs us. There is so much graphic violence and disrespect for humanity that it's at times hard to like it. Still, it never stops, right up to it's dramatic finish.",9,1,3,1 January 2010
Glory Road," Not Up to the Standards of Some Other Films
","This is a decent basketball movie, although I found out that it is virtually inaccurate. Don't take any of it as historically accurate. Now that doesn't diminish what Don Haskins accomplished. He just took longer than the time frame. The other thing that disappointed me was characterization. I never felt close to any of the players. They seemed to be a racial entity. The game scenes were OK but there just seemed to be a missing element. One of the biggest turnoffs for me was the pomposity of the coach. His endless speech making and philosophizing. Maybe he was like this, but I don't know how much of that stuff really inspires anyone. The film needed some other conflict than the usual racism of the south. I'd like to find out more about Adolph Rupp. How accurately was he portrayed? Anyway, when compared to 'Hoosiers,' or 'Remember the Titans,' this doesn't have the substructure of those sports films.",6,0,2,10 April 2007
Psycho," Tight and Terrifying
","When Hitchcock tells a tale, he engages the mind of the audience. We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh, people being strangled on the screen, or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still, when we are finished, we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho, it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist, Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates, with his nervous tics, his analytical surmises, his understatement, are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling. The things which were still with me a month after seeing this for the first time were as follows:1. The house. That ominous house, peering down, Poe-like from the hill above the motel. How can architecture better capture threat.2. The scene with the patrolman.3. The conversation Norman when Marion first stops at the motel.4. The shower scene. I can still hear the theramin (used again at the end), and the blood flowing down the shower drain.5. The killing of Martin Balsam on the stairs (he also used this perspective in Vertigo and Topaz).6. The 'conversations' with Mother.7. The naked light bulb swinging as the rocker turns around and Norman coming into the basement.What a great director. He saw everything and knew how to fill every minute with suspense. A truly masterly film.",10,2,3,5 October 2001
Rosemary's Baby," Overwhelming Blackness
","Having seen this film when it first came out, I wondered if I would react the same way seeing it again. Well, the answer is I did. This film is one of the most terrifying I've ever seen. Mia Farrow is the innocent woman who moves in with her husband, John Cassevetes. They have a group of neighbors who seem wonderful. They approach her in a kindly fashion. They support her in her day to day life, offering help to her. They feel it is time to have a baby and then the fear starts. One night she has a dream encounter with something that appears to be Satanic. Soon she starts to have cravings that she can't explain and odd things begin to happen in the apartment building. Soon, it is obvious, that the upcoming birth is of great interest to one truly evil people. There is so much more. Suffice it to say, the suspense built up and acted out is exciting.",10,1,4,7 December 2016
Jersey Boys," Captures the Spirit of the Broadway Play
","I was surprised to see how long this show has been on Broadway. Having seen the touring show, I have become a fan. I was suspicious of the movie version because my first response is nearly always, 'How will they screw this up?' They didn't. Clint Eastwood managed to keep the rapid fire story of the four guys from New Jersey well paced an interesting throughout. It starts with the three things that happen to kids. One is to become famous, and that is pretty far out there. A doowop group manages to make a few bucks while breaking and entering and spending an occasional six months in prison. They have no spark, until Frankie Valli becomes a part of them. His falsetto elevates the rest of the group but they still are stuck in place. Enter Bob Gaudio, the true genius of the group. He, along with Bob Crewe, become the reason things begin to blossom. They take their stupid name 'The Four Lovers' and turn it into 'The Four Seasons.' There are some cracks about this guy Vivaldi but since he's dead it doesn't matter. As things transpire we alternate between the successes of the group, culminating with their appearance on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' Through all this we get to hear the music. The hit list is really nice and they do very good renditions of the songs. In order to get them seed money, Tommy DeVito hooks up with a loan shark from the mob and eventually drops the group into nearly seven hundred thousand dollars in debt. As big as they were, this was real money. How they deal with that and the tribulations of their day-to-day existences is what this is all about. The time zips by as we develop a real attraction for this charismatic quartet. I found it to be a wonderful film.",9,12,18,25 June 2014
Zero Dark Thirty," Those Puffy Sounding Body Shots
","Hollywood has the ability to create incredible effects and adapt its talents to whatever has gone on. Like Argo, we are left wondering just how accurate these efforts can be. The film begins with torture and sheer brutality. A prisoner has things done to him that make us sit back and cringe. Are the people doing this supposed to be heroic in some way? Are there results really effective. After about fifteen minutes of this, we get to see the dogged, monomaniacal Maya, played by Jessica Chastain, use her anger and frustration with the slow acting military to get her way. I'm fully aware of the atrocities that had been committed and the role of Osama bin Laden, but was it worth any more than a publicity stunt to put the kind of effort into getting this guy. There is some very good intrigue and I am willing to bet that the movie is pretty accurate in its portrayal. My worry is that this kind of movie glamorizes the 'anything goes' mentality that has filtered into the minds of people. We have always prided ourselves on being better than this. In the movie, when things go bad, it's because of inadequate security and indecisive authority. This, of course, ultimately leads to the Bin Laden compound in Pakistan and the raid that took the guy out. Once launched, we are treated to a feast of violence. Those second and third shots into an already dead body have a puffy little sound. These men will be seen as heroes, but they also will be seen as people have been trained to kill first and ask questions later. This mission was successful, but did it require a total disregard for the rights of humanity. Bin Laden was the target, but the bodies piled up all over the place and little children were terrorized.",6,2,8,25 July 2013
Crazy Heart," He Hits the Nail on the Head
","At first I thought, 'There's nothing gong on here.' Then I realized that what was going on here was a real human being was being portrayed for me. The character of Bad is so well drawn. He is gruff, sensitive, sad, all those things, but what he is mostly is believable. I grew up with drunks and knew so many others. They are often so pathetic because they often want so badly to be what they are not. Bad is all these things. He makes huge mistakes but his buddy is the bottle; it's his best friend. Maggie Gyllenhaal is cute and vulnerable and true to form. She has been burned so often but takes one more chance. The results are the way results should be. If you are looking for a major event of earth shattering proportions, don't come here. If you want true characters that thrust and parry and don't always get their way, see this. Bridges deserved the Oscar.",9,3,5,26 May 2010
War of the Worlds," Not a Disappointment
","I remember how excited I was when I saw this remake was being done. Having been totally burned on the remake of 'The Time Machine' (all that money and no imagination--what was wrong with the basic story?), I was suspect. While the new 'War of the Worlds' parts company with the novel by H. G. Wells, it stands very well by itself. First of all, the machines of destruction are amazing to look at. They are truer to the original than the fifties version (although it is still a really cool movie). The overriding threat of societal annihilation comes through. Even Wells let us know this was a culture beyond our earthbound knowledge, so their war machines had to dwarf our meek efforts.The human story does very well. Tom Cruise playing a self-absorbed character (imagine that) grows throughout the film. Dakota Fanning is our new Wunderkind actress and plays opposite Cruise very well. Their travels to avoid death leave us on the edges of our seats. Just as with the original, it's everyone for themselves--the best and the worst of humanity show through with a few shell shocked nut cases and survivalists thrown in for good measure.The scene along the river, with people trying to cross to safety, gives us a titanic (no pun intended) view of our fragility. The weakness is a barrage of schmaltz in the second half of the movie, particularly in the ending. You can see visions of 'Close Encounters' here and there in images Spielberg puts forth. Nevertheless, it's really an exciting film and should stand the test of time. Good nightmare material.",8,2,4,14 February 2006
Hercules," Watered Down Hercules
","I was a little disappointed that Disney studios didn't look a little more closely at the Greek myth of Hercules. I know it's for kids, but there was so much that could have been added to the legend. He had the 12 labors, you know. Instead, it gets down to having a battle with Hades. Once again we have a terrifying villain (most are interchangeable) who actually serves a real purpose in the underworld. The confrontations are well done. As usual, the animation is spot on, but the sophistication of the story just isn't there. It ends up big lunk versus bad guy. We've seen it all a hundred times. Actually just about every movie, including those Sword and Sandal things in the sixties have the same basic plot. They used to give jobs to big time weight lifters.",7,0,2,29 December 2016
All Quiet on the Western Front," How Appropriate in This Time
","Wars are fought for many reasons. Most of them have to do with money and property. Lives are thrown away, frequently, so someone can have a little more for themselves. We should know from our current situation, how true this is. It's always the soldiers that get stuck in the middle of all this. They heroically go off to war and when they get there, they get to see first hand what it's truly about. The simplistic and romantic that are spewed by those who are not asked to fight become an unrecognizable din. Most of these people in their comfortable offices, their big houses, have no conception of war. Remarque set out to show what World War I was all about. The parades of young men going off to this ugly war with its trenches, bombs, and mustard gas, took enormous casualties. The pontificating professor, telling his students how glorious it is to fight is appalled by the returning young man who has been there and doesn't fall into line with his rhetoric. War is chaos and despair. If you ever saw the first few minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan,' you wonder how we can do this to each other. I am not an old man, but my father was. He was in World War I. He wasn't in the combat shown here. He was a trumpeter in an Army band. He did carry bodies off people who had died of flu in Brest in France. He mentioned what some of his less fortunate friends went through in that conflict. This is a marvelous film. Soldiers should be honored for everything they do. Somewhere we need to get a handle on our need to wage war. Yes, we must defend ourselves. But ask yourself what you're willing to sacrifice so this doesn't happen. Like a few gallons of gas?This movie depicts the bleak panorama of combat. The scenes for the time are marvelous and hurtful and hateful. Also, remember, this is from a German perspective which makes it ever more interesting.",10,4,7,22 March 2006
There Will Be Blood," Milkshake?
","You can criticize this film at points, but the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is astonishing. He certainly has made a career of being menacing. His very presence commands the screen. The sociopath that he plays here is one of those, taking everything he can, having no regrets for his cruelty at any point. He does betray his son and still blames anyone who mentions him, assuming they are judging him. They have every right to. It's interesting that it isn't just the righteous who land on their feet. Daniel is willing to do anything to get what he wants. His passions and obsessions are right there. Anyone who hooks up with him has to know that they are simply pawns in the game. This film is filled with memorable scenes and subtle threat. Levi, the minister, is certainly quite complex and as ambitious as Daniel. His pliable face works for me, though some say he is too whiny and obvious. To me, this is what would work in this setting. For most of the movie he is Daniel's equal in the role of charlatan. The bowling alley scene at the end is worth the price of admission.",9,3,4,17 February 2010
Joker," It's About a Man
","While I've watched many of the superhero movies that have come down the pike,
they are often the same. So the compensation for sensational plots involves great special effects and non-stop action. They are fun and I don't mean to dis them. What is missing is a truly psychological drama. We don't get into the heads of the characters. This film is incredible as we watch a man confront his demons. We see him made fun of, attacked, and beaten. When he responds, he is seen as crazy. He also find that he is diminished in the eye of a counselor, and his mother has kept a secret. I thought it gave us a foundation for the Batman mythos without getting to deeply into it. Acting, atmosphere, and a sophisticated plot makes this a really excellent film.",10,4,8,7 March 2020
To Kill a Mockingbird," When a Book and a Movie Knock It Out of the Park
","There is something so sensitive yet intense in Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch. He is a man of great honor and true humanity. He takes it all inside, dealing with the realities of what he is facing. He ignore the threats and sees a man for a man. However, he is doomed but represents an action out of time. I was especially impressed with the children in this movie. They are not scene stealers but rather show the future if allowed to grow up. As the trial moves along, it is obvious that there is little that can be said to counteract the hate that is there. But like most of us, Atticus and look in the mirror at the end of the day and say he did what was right. Gregory Peck was a top ten actor and wandered smoothly from movies such as 'Moby Dick' to 'The Omen.' He was masterful in psychological thrillers such as 'Spellbound.' This was, however, his finest hour. The man with the rumpled suit and the big heart.",10,2,5,30 July 2014
The Bridge on the River Kwai," It Doesn't Have to Be Historically Accurate
","To criticize movies for historical inaccuracy is to damn almost every work of historical fiction. First of all, the people who were there were not involved in the production. Secondly, if movies were truly historically accurate, they would be so dull, you couldn't watch them. To start with, this is based on a work of fiction. It is an idealized version of an event that took place some time in the past. It's characters are fictionalized. We don't know what they said or really did. Some were probably combinations of two or three different characters. Also, the criticism that people wouldn't make deals with the enemy is pretty naive. Sometime the deal making is what keeps you alive and gives you a chance to fight another day. It's easy to say that one would do or not do something, sitting on a couch in a living room. It doesn't reflect badly on soldiers in war time to be afraid, and, yes, seemingly traitorous. The story is a wonderful one about courage and drive and sacrifice and pain. This is how we as human beings keep going. A man once told me that the one consistent trait that Holocaust survivors had was that they had determined a goal in their lives. The building of the bridge becomes something to live for, even if it is for the gratification of the enemy. Of course, the leader cracked and almost destroyed the mission. This does happen. It doesn't diminish the movie or the character. This is a wonderful, exciting film with great performances, even if history may not totally accept it.",9,0,3,31 March 2006
A Hard Day's Night," It Seems a Million Years Ago
","I was a male teenager in the 1960's. To me and my friends, the Beatles and the British invasion was so important. We were normal kids with all kinds of other things going on, but whenever a new album came out we were there. There was so little footage of the guys because other than the news when they came to a new city, it was non-existent. Videotape was minimal. There was some film of their concerts but the screaming drowned out most of the music. When 'A Hard Day's Night' came along it was gift. We had the 'Ed Sullivan Show' and that was it, so to see all those songs being performed and hearing them talk and act. Fantastic. I couldn't afford to go to the one concert at the old Metropolitan Stadium (home of the Twins in Bloomington, MN) because we were a very poor family, but my friends told me they were unable to hear anyway. Still, it would have been a great experience. The wonderful thing about this film is that it is funny and intelligent and works so well. It is about the Beatles as it should be, and yet there is a surreal element that is so precious. So much has been written about Richard Lester and what he did, but he deserves it. A film that changed the world when it came to taking pop music to another level.",10,0,1,17 March 2015
Man on Fire," Garden Variety Bloodbath!
","About half the movies I see these days start with a great premise and manage to get us involved, then they can't seem to add anything. This is, of course, the story of another man with more baggage than Samsonite who begins to turn his life around when he meets a cute young girl played by Dakota Fanning, for whom he becomes the father she's never really had. Obviously, she is going to be kidnapped and he's going to have to seek revenge (it's all on the disk packaging). I have to agree with the critics when it come to the downfall of this movie. It's one act of violence after another. Of course, these are the sleaziest people on the face of the earth. We can comfortably say they deserve what they get. But it is a calculated bloodbath with creative ways to make people suffer that puts in the realm of sadism. No matter if the child may have been brutally murdered, Denzel Washington's character can't be embraced because he is almost inhuman. Anyway, it is no more than I expected. Washington does what he can with the script and the direction, but as a human being he is really a sorry case.",6,0,2,25 March 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Excellent Film-making; Excellent Casting
","Take a book like Ken Kesey's which did startle some and had a good following. I read it in a graduate English class. I remember setting it down and saying, 'That's a pretty good book.' It is well written with insights into the characters, but I didn't get the life I did in the movie. Throw a good director and some great character actors into a film like this; add Jack Nicholson, one of the most complex actors on the face of the earth; throw in Louise Fletcher with her soft spoken acts of terror; and you have a real film. Even though there are a few differences between the book and the movie, I actually enjoyed the book more the second time because the movie extended, for me, the depth of the characters. I don't know if Kesey would like to hear that, but sometimes it becomes a win win situation. The mental patients (some people choose to call them psychos which isn't fair) are wonderfully alive and full of their own being. Nicholson's character comes along and pulls out the humanity from them. I met some of the most wonderful people when I worked at a state mental hospital for a time (I now teach Junior High kids, which is a whole other issue). How would you like to be treated, given their setting? Medicated and controlled? There was a lot of that where I worked and I always thought, you may as well sentence them to death as treat them as you are. I think things are a bit more enlightened now. I think that maybe the movie helped a bit. This one has always been a top ten film in my book.",10,2,4,30 March 2006

Cruise is killed numerous times by these things and always come back to the same place. He learns more about the mission and the creatures each time he goes back. In the process, he meets a female war hero played by Emily Blunt who has the same time warping thing going on. The proceed to relive the same times over and over. She, unfortunately, has no recollection of what was done. This is powerful, intelligent science fiction with a knock dead premise. Yes, 'Wake up, Maggot' is this movie's 'I Got You, Babe,' from 'Groundhog Day.' And the idea of reliving our day over and over isn't brand new, but the battle scenes are awesome and the aliens powerful and disgusting. There is a wonderful bond that develops between Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. It isn't the maudlin empty headed stuff like we saw in 'Independence Day' many years ago. We really get to care about the people. This movie really surprised me.",9,2,7,18 February 2015
Downfall," The Lunatic and HIs Partners
","I assume that this is a relatively accurate account of the events in the bunker as the Russians occupied Berlin and Hitler met his demise. This is an incredible film. It first shows us the events that are war, not just the soldiers, but the civilian casualties. Also the forces of mindless dedication to a cause and 'honor.' As we watch the unstable Fuhrer and those surrounding him, pledged to destroy the world and take no prisoners (the cause is all; it is not for the weak), it's hard to feel sympathy, yet the collateral damage done by their decisions, wives and innocent children, for example, take this out of the realm of sanity. I know that the Russians committed atrocities too, as did the 'civilized people in the war, but the blindness of the principles to what end, that of an unbalanced creature with virtually no redeeming qualities, is hard to take. And then, of course, most of them took the cowardly way out when their hopes are dashed. Yet we still fight wars and do these things to each other. This is a striking film and everyone should have an opportunity to see it.",10,0,1,16 February 2010
Whiplash," A Brutal Character
","A previous reviewer mention Full Metal Jacket, the Kubrick film about the vicious Drill Sergeant who dehumanizes his men, but one of those men in particular. However, in that movie, the young Marine probably had no business being where he was. Here, a young man wants to be a drummer who will be remembered, like Gene Krupa or Buddy Rich. He has awesome ability which is recognized by Fletcher (Academy Award winner J. K. Simmons). His method involves brutalizing and horrifying his charges and humiliating them in front of their peers. People know he's the best there is, but what a price to pay. He justifies his intensity by repeating some incident where another band member threw cymbal at Charlie Parker's head. While this is good entertainment, if we were to look into the successes of many great performers, most of them were never terrorized. The drumwork is astounding, but all the bleeding is pretty far fetched. Ask some drummers you know. The final scene is all Hollywood as most reality goes out the window. Still, if you buy into the possibility that such a psychotic can command these musicians, it's very entertaining. The drumming is beyond belief, although I'm sure there were some strategic cuts along the way.",8,1,4,12 June 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Just Kind of Tiresome
","I kept waiting for something to happen that had even an element of surprise. The plot has to do with a character who is great at using the stock market to his advantage and then spreading the loot around. He has a group of dysfunctional sociopaths working for him and for some reason they are successful. This is all contrived to make things move along and be interesting. As the profits rise, there is more and more debauchery that is about as graphic as anything I've seen. The interesting thing is that it is not erotic; it is just plain boring. DiCaprio has a lot of lines and gets to emote like crazy, reveling in his excessive use of drugs and his lack of any kind of commitment. I suppose this is so outrageous that we viewers who are not with it don't realize it is tongue in cheek. I knew where the principle plot was going and had a hard time imagining that so many people could exist under these circumstances. It's just rotten people doing rotten things to other people. It's like Caligula has been reborn in the 21st Century.",4,7,12,4 June 2015
The Last King of Scotland," Whitaker Is Amin
","The most frightening character in history is the man who smiles. A person who can slaughter thousands and torture even more, and be a joker, is appalling. Forest Whitaker presents Idi Amin, the horror of Uganda. He comes off as a charming, outgoing source of venom. Obviously, there are liberties taken that are there with any historical drama, but the recency of his reign give us more immediacy. It also can make it more likely to be attacked. There is no question about Amin, however.",9,2,3,3 May 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Oh My Goodness!
","Excuse me, but I just read a series of reviews by people who are disappointed by the fact that this movie didn't follow the same old script that has been done over and over and over again. They gave a provocative movie a rating of '1' so they could sabotage what most people thought. Go do something else besides writing about films. This is not a perfect movie, but it takes the basic text of the Stoker novel and extrapolates from it. People seem to be reacting tot he sexuality of this. If we go back to the seminal movies, 'Nosferatu' being the greatest example, we see that sexual tension dominates these films as well as the books. Dracula has power over people. He can draw women to him. He is not an animal, but he is a sub-human with desires to dominate. Coppola uses this to show his evil intent. Gary Oldman is the most eccentric and wonderful Dracula to come along in years. When did it become written that every Dracula should be the black-caped Bela Lugosi figure that kids still dress up as on Halloween. He is a force to be reckoned with; he is evil; and he is powerful. Remember, people accept the scenes of him sucking the blood out of women without any trouble. Why not an evil abuser of their being? Remember, they are under a spell over which they have no control.",8,3,5,30 December 2016
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Like a Cartoon
","I can only recommend this movie because it is no more than its intentions. When it begin, I thought it was at least trying to be somewhat realistic. Once I got over that, it turned out to be pretty funny. In nearly every instance, the most outrageous kind of behavior was presented. The romantic angle and the seriousness of the young woman, striving to be an anchor herself in the good old boys' club, becomes as ridiculous as the whole Will Ferrell schtick. Scenes are borrowed from other movies (The Sandlot with the guys from the other TV station on bikes or Gangs of New York with brutality and dismemberment). I did find Ron Bergundy charming. Everything is locker room, but they are all such boobs that you can't take them seriously. The fact that the world is set on its ear over the birth of a panda while other more serious stuff gets no time at all is pretty believable. Those other three guys are hilarious. I loved the photo shoots they used to lead in to the news. If you want something that has no real message because it is so sophomoric, but you can laugh at the implausible (an almost cartoonish sense), go ahead and blow and hour and a half on this. Just don't expect to be enlightened.",7,0,1,4 May 2006
American Gangster," Gripping Characters/Frightening Events
","I guess this is a fictional retelling of actual events. The character of Frank (Denzel Washington) is the story of a man, who because of his own issues with the abuse of being a black man with few prospects, driven to become 'great.' Unfortunately, his greatness is tied up in exporting pure heroin from Vietnam and selling it. He is a murderer, a liar, and every way a criminal. He is charming on the outside and deadly on the inside. There is no way that a thinking person could admire him. If his vendetta and his business were directed only at bad guys, we might think that it is OK. But he kills indiscriminately, many dying as innocent victims. Russell Crowe's prosecutor is determined and insightful. He is himself a loner (a role Crowe does well at in many films), but he must butt heads all the way along. He has committed a 'crime.' He has found and returned thousands of dollars in drug money found on a case. He is seen as a bit of an idiot and hence not on of 'the guys.' Everything plays out well. Two masterful actors doing what they do best. I think my most memorable scene is the one where they come upon the poppy fields in Vietnam where this stuff is being cooked and dried. It would be like going to SonyCorp or some big Asian business; but this is a factory used to make one of the most destructive substances. See this because it is a fascinating story and it is masterfully done.",8,1,2,22 February 2011
Stranger Than Fiction," Much More than I Expected
","This is a pretty engaging movie. For me Will Farrell is really up and down. I would generally consider him pretty lightweight. This film, however, shows that he has a great deal more range than I've given him credit for. Once we accept the premise of the whole thing, he begins to engage us. His plight is certainly one of great urgency. What I enjoyed was that they didn't play it for a sense of slapstick. Some filmmakers would have used the author's touch to put him in all kinds of ridiculous situations, finding himself naked on a street, or hooked up with some street gang, or some other ludicrous thing. He come off as a truly developing character who probably does what most of us would have done. Granted, he is a quirky IRS agent with symptoms of OCD, but the story is about what happens when you begin to realize how precious life is. It's been done a million times, but here it works quite well. It doesn't even matter that the writer painted himself into a corner because the joy of the movie is watching Farrell's character commandeer his ship. Emma Thompson's character is just a bit much; so is Dustin Hoffman, but they are certainly interesting.",8,0,1,28 September 2009
The Green Mile," A Little Editing Please
","I had no experience with the book. I should have suspected that the supernatural would begin to play into this. It took me a while to get away from it being a grandchild of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' to a movie about healing and the power to heal. The whole issue of the electric chair is what I remember the most. The dramatic way we have performed capital punishment. I remember Susan Hayward in ' I Want to Live.' I was 10 years old and the movie still haunts me. Had this man not been a healer, a supernatural creature, the story would have been just fine. His character is so multi-dimensional in the way it lights up a screen. He has that strong presence that says, 'All will be right.' He goes about his business despite the hatred that hovers around him, the redneck culture that has done this to him. He holds his head high because he is right. Tom Hanks is second in the portrayal of pain, both physical and emotional. He is such a heroic figure himself. This is quite a film.I am going to have to agree, however, with the people who complain about the length. I believe with proper film editing, this could have been a compact two and a half hours and it would have had much more impact on the audience. There are times when one says, enough, and I hate to be thinking that. I found my mind wandering at times. That mentioned, see this, but be prepared for a movie of human ugliness but hopefulness.",9,0,1,20 April 2006
The Reader," Incredebly Balanced
","This is an amazingly believable film. The types of dilemmas faced by the characters are the kinds of things that easily could have happened. There's pride and anger and self doubt. This is really a story about a man who has been shaken loose from innocence, who must face the fact that someone he loved or thought he loved could have been a monster. Still, even if she was a monster, we cannot totally condemn her. Kate Winslet is incredible from the sexually driven streetcar conductor to the perpetrator of an event that killed hundreds of Jews. The amazing thing is that she can't get her mind around what she has done. She saw it as a way to find work since everyone was at war and she needed the employment. She is painfully honest which is hard to fathom for the courts. Roy Fiennes has a connection to her because of their affair, but he is still repulsed by the events. Because of his basic human kindness he continues to read to her as he did by recording books on audio tapes (he comes to realize that she can't read or write). There are not simple answers and no last minute discovery; it's about people trying to connect. This is a fine film.",9,1,1,17 September 2009
Jaws," There must be something in the water!
","I think this is a very good movie. I don't think it's a great one. If one is going to have contemporary monster, you can go two routes. You can bring in the supernatural element and give it powers beyond those of mortal men (sorry Superman), or you can make it a natural danger, where it plays by the rules that nature sets up. This shark appears to have a personal agenda, and it's at that point, the move loses me a bit. Granted there are really fun performances by Shaw, Dreyfuss, and Scheider. They are such caricatures. The byplay between them works quite well. I did feel at times they did little to protect themselves and that was disappointing. You can be the soldier of fortune, but don't just walk in front of the cannon. There is suspense, and that shark is really frightening. What is done with the camera is the true star of the film. The shots of the swimmers' legs from under the water is true genius. And, of course, if you ever want to teach someone the importance of a musical score for a movie, you need go no farther. My kids gave me the anniversary edition of this for my birthday. I need to take a look at it again. It's certainly a formidable movie.",8,0,1,5 April 2006
The Wrestler," Rourke's Masterpiece
","When I saw this title, I thought, 'Good Lord. It's a rasslin movie. I assumed it would be some juvenile portrayal of the Smackdown people and their ilk. I was wrong. What we have is an insider's view of the incredible world of these people. Rourke is an aging hero called the Ram. He is past his prime and when he does wrestle he ends up loaded with more bumps and bruises than he can count--if not real, it is a tremendously athletic sport. There are subplots with an off and on relationship with Marissa Tomei, an exotic dancer, and his estranged daughter. He is unpredictable, messed up on pain killers and life. He also finds out he is living with a time bomb--a heart that could give out at any time. The strength of this is the subtle, beautiful performance of Mickey Rourke. His acting is superb. We can see the pathos in his eyes. A man who was great but has nothing left to show for it. It's about a man just trying to get by, who wants to make one more score. This is superb film about something we know little of.",10,3,6,18 December 2009
Kong: Skull Island," Stupid People on a Stupid Mission
","I can't contribute much here because most of the nay-sayers have already said 'Nay.' First of all, we have no real idea why the government would ante up for this ludicrous venture. Once the Senator decides to go along with it, a truly idiotic array of cannon fodder and expensive helicopters head off, not knowing a thing about their reason for doing so. The early scene of Kong destroying the copters is asinine. Once he grabbed the first chopper, the rest of the pilots should have backed off and figured things out. Kong's arms are long but about 30 feet would have put them out of harm's way. There is so much that goes unexplained in this thing and so many plot holes, it's hard to get into it. Sam Jackson plays the same part he has played about sixteen times (were there any snakes in those helicopters?). The rest of the stiff acting company does nothing to develop any sort of connection for us. Even the hero guy is about as boring as one can be. I could go on, but others have already poked holes in it enough.",5,1,2,29 June 2018
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Bit Weak at the End
","I really enjoyed the first two. I don't buy into the criticism that a 300 page book couldn't be made into a full blown trilogy. That said, I found the last episode way too full of battle scenes and gratuitous violence, big armies banging into each other, terrible orcs riding wolves, and the ultimate confrontation. In the process, all the charm that had been built up in the first two movies seemed to be dropped for a bunch of special effects. It starts well with the appearance of Smaug who fulfills his promise of destroying the town. But after that its a hodge-podge of romance and revenge and ultimately death. As this one ended, I literally felt, 'Oh, is that the end?' Having read 'The Hobbit' a couple of times, I knew what was going to happen, but it didn't quite work the way I thought it would. There was just something empty. Don't get me wrong, I could revel in the effort, but I can't say that this will stay with me for a long time.",7,4,9,25 December 2014
Ray," It Was Like He Was There
","Ray Charles defines soul and country. He was at times a harsh man, a man desiring perfection. His discography is massive and the quality of his performances are stunning. All this after growing up blind. Instrumentally, he drove the train. For Jamie Foxx to take on this man as a dramatic character calls for real courage. Not only does he capture the physical presence of the man, he captures his movements, his idiosyncrasies, his voice. What criticism there is of this performance seems to bank on there being no reason to have a bio-pic because to treat a contemporary subject is always lacking--the person is still too fresh in our minds. This may be true with Oliver Stone because he not only presents a character, but he gets in his own political agenda. Here, the movie is a way of doing honor to a great performer. There are also criticisms of Charles holding back on supporting civil rights. Well, nobody said he didn't have his failings; it's all the more reasons put forth an accurate portrayal of the man. Foxx is superb.",10,1,3,11 January 2017
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," A Complete Animated Adventure
","I need to comment on this because it's the first feature length film I ever saw. This would be in about 1952. Obviously, it had been released several times over the years. My mom took my sister and me to see it at our little home town theater. I have to tell you, those things they say about Disney and little kids are true. I have never seen anything since that affected me as profoundly. There was the sense of evil. The Queen with the mirror. The fact that she is sending a child into the woods to be killed. My gosh. I'm five years old and a child is about to be murdered. Then there are those little guys, each with a character trait to match his name. The story is one of vengeance. The queen transforming herself and then going on the prowl with those apples. The scene of her death is horrible. And then there is a death experience. She lies in that crystal coffin. Will she be OK? Everyone was crying in the theater. And then, of course, the prince comes along. It's just a masterful telling of a simple tale with memorable characters, violence, and purification through suffering. When Grumpy cries...well I tell you.There are things in my life that I am so grateful for. Walt Disney's empire may be the most overwhelming in entertainment. But these seminal animated features will live forever. I'm glad I was alive to experience them.",10,15,17,28 February 2006
The Lion King," Wonderful Music and Rhythms
","This is an outstanding work of animation. I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures.",9,3,4,28 March 2006
Inception," Come Back Again!
","If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.",10,5,17,31 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," The Little Engine That Couldn't
","I have to agree with several others who have commented on this film. It lacks any sort of spark. Each actor plays to the camera and there is little interaction among them. Johnny Depp is pretty good as the victim, but even he seems a caricature. It is a star studded cast and that may have been a mistake. Branagh's Poirot is so dull. And that awful mustache. It looks like he glued on the bristles from a hair brush. The plot is confusing and there is little mystery. When I saw the first film, I knew the ending, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are several strange events that take place in this one. Poirot is way to brusque and unpleasant. My picture of him is a kind of shyness. The ending scene, where things are explained and the murderer revealed, is incredibly dull. Too much hoopla and not enough good direction.",6,3,9,11 November 2017
Defiance," Not Ground Breaking
","When an event such as the Holocaust occurs, it gives us a little comfort when we think that there was at least something going on to counter the bastards that were doing this. The resistance movement meant that the Jews weren't going off to slaughter without a by-your-leave. This movie gives us a glimpse at such a group as they survive one day to the next, having to establish a harsh community with harsh rules to continue to survive. It is the rules that are at the center of this as two strong-willed men attempt to lead the rebels. We get to see what it would be like to deal with the psyches of the oppressed, facing a religious dilemma on one hand and dealing with a survival instinct. For some reason, this movie doesn't have the spark it could have. I think one reason is the enemy is not developed enough. They are the usually ambiguous entity that we have grown to hate. They are themselves cannon fodder and so by dehumanizing them, we also take a great deal of the tension out of the film. Moral ambiguity needs to be center stage. While it's a decent movie, it doesn't stand out.",7,0,1,29 December 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Forget the Past!
","Books should not be compared to movies. Movie versions should not be compared to each other. If you are a true artist, you always put your stamp on your production. The stories of Arthur Conan Doyle are masterpieces and they have had their time. If one is willing to come up with a new angle using the characters as perceived by the public, more power to him. There have been hundreds of pastiches done with the Holmes canon. Anyway, the film before us uses a preposterous plot that has angered the purists. It's probably some of the same people who died a little each day after Lord of the Rings and Spiderman came out. This film is a joyful mess in the tradition of Indian Jones. The two principles, Holmes and Watson grow on us and take us on a merry ride through London into some pretty weird stuff. It doesn't matter what has been done before, just enjoy the ride and look to the future. But don't forget the wonderful efforts of Basil Rathbone and Jeremy Brett. They can, indeed, coexist.",8,0,2,26 May 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Same Old Stuff!
","Most movies these days are OK. Animation has become the vehicle of this moment. There was a time when we would be stunned by the incredible use of the animators craft. But once computers and their technicians go into the act and there was so much to watch, we needed something to stand out. While this is a movie about rivalries and being happy with what we have, there is no sparkle to it. There is just a lot of intense action and no reality to peak of. Yes, I did say reality. The anthropomorphic figures here need to be stunning. We've seen the chases and the splats and the tiresome human traits that have been done so often. I had not trouble watching and enjoying parts of this, but as a whole with a direction, it comes up rather short.",6,1,1,14 May 2018
WALL·E," Thoughtful and Kind
","I was skeptical when I heard that this was a movie about machines falling in love. This kind of thing has been done before and has left me cold. This movie, however, takes a character who has endured in his lot, a romantic robot at that, and gives him a chance to realize his dreams. He has learned about love from watching a dull old Disney-like musical. One of those forgettable things that children hated, but were frequently brought to by their parents. He has established himself a sentient being with a loving soul. One day a slick rocket ship drops a probe into his garbage infested landscape. It is a porcelain-like, egg shaped beauty with deadly capabilities needed for self-preservation. This critter is egg shaped, unlike Wall-e's dumpy presence. He falls in love with her (she is definitely quite feminine. Like all desperate males, he does what he can to impress her, almost at the expense of his existence. The other interesting aspect of this film is the human element. Humanity has devolved into fat, slovenly lumps, with no thoughts or ambitions. When Wall-e shows up in their spaceship, he throws a wrench into the works. This little commentary is inadequate. Mainly, I found the whole thing quite charming and the evolving love affair believable.",9,3,5,14 August 2009
The Good Shepherd," Damon is a Puzzle
","I had some mixed feelings about this film. First of all, it is so long that to sustain an interest in the frozen expressions of Matt Damon's characters through almost three hours is quite a challenge. At times I believe that he is actually becoming human. I'm not sure that we are really privy to his ghosts, even considering the letter from his father. When a movie makes the human beings so very cold, it begs some big questions. First of all, would be psychosis. Yes, I know there are patriotic zealots. This is just too much. On the other hand, this is a really interesting part of history. It is in the period where media didn't have its tentacles in everything; where spies could play at being spies and politicians didn't have to look over their shoulders. We also had the Russians and their potential on the minds of everyone, including school children. I think if Damon's character had just had a second dimension, it would have played a lot better. Even when his son comes into the picture, we know who his real child is. Like Jean Hackman in 'The Conversation' the paranoia runs so deep that he couldn't get out if he could. He has sold all his options.",7,0,0,2 January 2008
Finding Dory," Nothing New About It
","With all the awful adult films available this summer, we went to this. Having seen 'Nemo' several years ago, I expected something new and exciting. I'm a big Ellen DeGeneres fan, but the lame script and lack of punch made her offerings of little import. Once again, we have the fish, defying all the laws of nature. Dory is looking for her parents. If she were human, she would need constant supervision because her memory situation. She is supposedly capable of livings her life, but has no coping skills. I know this is an animated feature, but the very idea of finding her parents is so far-fetched, even to stretch the limits of this medium. Things are so contrived, including the whole business of quarantine and shipping fish to Cleveland and that octopus and so on, that I lost interest. Unlike the original movie, there was almost nothing funny here. Apparently Dory got older and bigger but Nemo is still a child and still the same size he was before. Has anyone asked about this? Visually, some of the movie was striking, but, when it was over, I didn't feel any emotion. There are so many superior animated features out there and Pixar didn't follow through on this one.",5,10,22,1 August 2016
Stalag 17," Bad Enough Being a Prisoner
","This is the first German prisoner of war movie I ever saw. While this is comedic at times, it is actually a serious drama (unlike an abomination like 'Hogan's Heroes' which is loosely based on this film). The strength of this is the ensemble acting where we get to meet and enjoy the different prisoners. William Holden, because he is enterprising, becomes the focus of his own men when it seems that the Germans are getting information from inside the barracks. Because he seems to have the ear of the commandant, they are sure that he is he rat. It will be his job to find out who is really behind all this. Sometimes the dialogue is dated and the situations a bit hard to accept, but it is a good drama with a sort of mystery novel premise.",9,1,2,5 December 2016
Arrival," A Lot of Potential But Never Got Me Involved
","I saw the premise to this film and so looked forward to seeing it. The whole linguistics thing and the variance of time is intriguing. I just don't think it was explained very well. I've had coursework in linguistic theory and language. I was still trying to figure out what she was seeing. I know that we have a universe that gets bent, but it seems too much like a god machine to me. She is hurt be the death of her daughter so we throw in a metaphysical curve to explain the intentions of an alien race. So Einstein is alive and well, but we need something more than this. The final few minutes are just too much.",6,5,12,14 March 2017
The Terminal," A Charming Movie
","This is a movie about little people who do their jobs every day. Tom Hanks plays a man who is caught at an airport because his country is experiencing a coup. What that means is that for the moment he has no country. He has no visa to get into the United States but depending on what ultimately happens in his country will determine if he can go back there. He begins to try to survive at the airport by figuring out how to find food and maintaining himself. Of course, there are bad guys who want him to accidentally set foot on American soil so they can arrest him. The airport officials are also harassing him. He meets Catherine Zeta Jones who is having a bad time and the two of them have a sort of relationship. We get to know all the airport employees who befriend the man. This is one of those movies that anyone would enjoy. Hanks is delightful as the main character. There is also a really touching subplot that keeps our interest.",8,1,3,9 January 2017
The Blind Side," Did It Really Happen This Way?
","This is a decent story about decent people. What it lacks is a sense that all this happened. When one has a recent biographical film, we wonder how much is created to move the story along. Take a fun football film like 'Remember the Titans.' It is based in the fact of busing and segregation. Did it really happen that way? Did those guys really bond that way. Or did they pretty much accept the fact that football requires them to put up or shut up. It's still a great story, as is this one. The real story is the fact that a wealthy white woman who actually exists brought Michael Oher into her home. All the details surrounding this may have been brushed over a bit. I feel it's missing a down and dirty part. Even the confrontations in the neighborhood a bit sanitized. It's a good human story; I just have a sneaking suspicion that some liberties were taken.",6,1,1,31 July 2010
Rango," Once Again, Listen to the Venom
","Rango manages to appeal to many interests. First of all, the recreation of the old West is charming. The animators have done a masterful job of producing a setting that really works. The chameleon star finds himself in Dirt, the aforementioned town, and is given the task of saving the water supply. Yes, it is a bit dark and the plot is sophisticated. So why so many 1's and 2's. Is it that people are so easily bored when their minds are a bit challenged by an animated film? This is one of the better films of the year and works on many levels. It also parodies tough Westerns that we have seen in contemporary times.",8,1,2,5 May 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Certainly an Ambiguous Challenge
","Michael Keaton and Edward Norton are terrific. They are wonderful actors in nearly every sense of the word. I was engaged most of the way, but then the flying sequences. He is indeed a broken man. He is probably schizophrenic, listening to himself discuss his failures through the persona of the character he used to play. Enough has been written about this movie (it was the darling of the Oscars) for me to offer much. Nevertheless, I feel that we need to play fair with the audience. If this was a demonstration of what is wrong with Broadway and the Broadway crowd, let us know. There is a great scene where he confronts a powerful theatre critic who can make or break a show with a bad review (I never understood the power of these people) and chastises her for her vindictiveness and and arrogance in ruining peoples lives when she, herself, must not face the music. I'm sure her editors would disagree, but what he says is true. Unfortunately, as we roll to the end, we are made to make up our minds. I suppose it's OK not to be one with the character, but the ending is truly ambiguous, to a fault. Fantastic acting by the whole cast, yet it left me really cold at the end.",7,2,6,23 May 2015
The Big Short," So Much Greed/So Little Compassion
","I have to admit that I don't understand all the intricacies of the bond markets that were being manipulated here. Whether one is a Wall Street maven or not isn't the issue. The fact is that people sold mortgages to others who had no business getting into them. I recall a 60 Minutes report on the bubble before the crash took place. The expert had them drive through a desert area, filled with enormous houses, all of which were in default. If one looked in the windows of these, you could see that some of the tenants had stripped all kinds of fixtures and walked away. There were two types of buyers, it seemed. Those that were trying for the fast buck and those that really had no clue what they were getting into. The balloon mortgages took them from affordable to bankruptcy. This was unsustainable and it wasn't long before the banks found themselves with armloads of houses and buyers with hopeless debt. The guys in the movie are aware, but, for the most part, aren't all that sympathetic to these foibles. They go in to make money and they manage to do it. The whole thing that overrides this entire film is that all the evidence was right there, but the greed of most of the parties supersedes all of that. I thought this was a fine movie with a superb lesson. To the new generation. You may not be entitled to have whatever you want without paying your dues.",9,4,5,24 April 2016
Scream," More Than I Expected
","I decided to see this because it has become a cultural icon. Having seen so many slasher movies, I decided long ago they just weren't very interesting. This is mainly because of the predictability that is presented in this film. Yes, that does make it gimmicky, but then it also makes it clever. Nothing is left out when it comes to violence. It's all there. Of course, there's about ten 'jump out' scares and all the stereotypes. Still, it kept me going. There is layer upon layer of surprises and we actually do care somewhat about the people in the film. The mask must have been quite the thing when this first appeared. I still see them when I answer the door on Halloween. One nice thing is that, for the most part, now that I've seen all the classics of this form, and have seen this movie as well, I don't need to watch any more.",8,0,1,25 March 2010
Halloween," The Prototype
","No, it's not the first slasher movie, far from it. But it granted legitimacy to the genre. The setup and the quality of the acting and the timing of events is startling. We are brought into the insanity that is Michael Myers. The initial event that brought him to the asylum is graphic and horrifying. This movie begins later and Myers is on the loose. Jamie Lee Curtis is the teenager that becomes central to the plot. She is a good choice because she is no pushover. As Myers attacks and attacks and attacks, she uses he resilience to withstand his assault. It's a little remindful of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (the second movie) when there is so much to lose, you are going to go down fighting. Of course, this film launched a bevy of sequels and copycat teenage slasher films, but this one is so nicely crafted that it rises above the rest.",9,6,9,21 December 2016
Paths of Glory," Those Who Decide Should Fight
","I've often been Luke warm about Kirk Douglas. This, however, is a phenomenal movie. War is usually fought by people who have no say in what is happening. The despicable man who can send thousands to their deaths to get a military promotion is every bit as bad as the enemy being fought. We have a lot of that going on in this country. Those who choose war should fight it or send their own to fight it. This is ad much a story of how people treat each other as it is a war movie. We hand over power to a complex that sustains itself on the backs of those who never get to state their cases. The men chosen are done so in an arbitrary way, caught unawares and defenseless. Of course, religion plays a part in it too. We may die, but there is a reward for us. There are so many parallels to what happens to men in combat (the ambush, for instance) that these men become victims. Like someone said, so much war is fought over anthills. I have never felt so sorry for characters as I do for these because they are defenseless. The cockroach scene has stayed with me my whole life. It's the same basic premise as Galipoli (which came much later).",10,1,3,16 February 2007
Despicable Me," What a Delightful Surprise!
","This is an animated effort with great characters, lots of action, and some really touching moments. I had heard so much about it and was set for disappointment. I actually believe that they actually used restraint in the portrayal. Along with 'Up' from a previous year, I've regained some of my admiration for animators (should have thrown in Toy Story 3 as well). It is so nice not to have to deal with the lowest common denominator. I actually began to care about people who weren't really people. The plot is complex and interesting and there is one of my favorite themes: redemption. Like 'Up,' we get to see why the character is the way he is. Human history--wonderful. What I like is that children will watch this and should be moved. No flatulence, no butt jokes, just really nice interaction. Also, the female characters are truly wonderful.",10,0,0,2 June 2011
Carrie," It Has Its Moments, But...
","I'm on the fence about this movie. I think the premise is excellent. Watching Sissy Spacek grow into her role is great. She is no one dimensional character. As she is persecuted by her classmates, we grow to like her, not because she is a victim, but we get to see that she is more than a caricature. She tries so hard to deal with all the pain that she has in her life When she is taken to the prom by Tommy, he has genuine motives toward her. Of course, it's a setup, but that's OK. He is still a trouper and doing everything he can to make this night a nice one. He's never in on the joke. I tend to go along with the general criticism That is, if one is going to have vengeance as a motive, we need to know precisely who is dispatched and why. The gym ends up looking like a bomb went off. The killing is random and non-directed. The good guys, the bad guys, the innocent bystanders. When one could at least get a sense of some revenge when the two nasties get theirs, it is diminished by the briefness and coldness of the act. I first saw this film 33 years ago and I have to say that it has one of the best scare scenes of all time. I was totally taken in by it. It's not a bad movie; however, with a little bit of characterization it could have been really good. I have a feeling they just wanted to get it down and go for the cheap thrills.",7,1,7,22 October 2009
The Queen," The Queen in Turmoil
","Once Princess Diana had been killed, there were expectations of the Queen of England. But instead of putting herself out there, she took the family and went into hiding. What this movie is about is how Great Britain began to want answers. We are made privy to the fact that the British press can be ruthless, especially the tabloids. Things get bad and Prime Minister Tony Blair comes on the scene. The Royals are incredibly resentful of this, particularly Prince Philip. The movie, and especially Helen Mirren, show us the fact that these are humans, even though they carry the weight of history. This is not a biography of the Queen.

","Hitchcock had little respect for actors. I bet he never met Robert DeNiro. This is his magnum opus. Martin Scorsese tells the story of Jake LaMotta, a man who could be a bum and his ability to overcome his lack of talent with gut-wrenching drive to fight his way to the top. In addition to DeNiro's benchmark acting performance, this film has some of the most outstanding cinematography that has ever been seen. The fight scenes are like ballet; for example, using the Air on a G String as the two fighters pummel one another. This is true genius. We get to see the humanity of LaMotta, a complex, somewhat violent man, carefully configured before our eyes. The use of black and white also gives us a sense of the 1940's boxing movies and then steps them up for us. There is a kind of starkness that never detracts from the endgame.",10,3,5,5 August 2015
The Iron Giant," Much More Than a Cartoon
","Sometimes when watching an animated feature, I spend my time saying, 'What great animation.' When this happens, I wonder if I am doing what the producers wanted me to do. Like so many things, should I be so enamored with the technical part of the movie that I am distracted from the content. As I watched 'The Iron Giant' I realized I had forgotten it was an animated feature. Don't get me wrong. I knew the enormous title character was animated, but the relationships among the characters and the intelligence of the script caused me to forget that these weren't actors. The movie is filled with tender moments, especially as they relate to our feelings of our own mortality. What I enjoyed is that the grownups aren't treated as garden variety bad guys. Even the military, which is nearly always portrayed as evil, finds itself in a contradictory position--having to go on faith. The animation is wonderful, but so are the 'performances.' No spoilers here, but I think the ending is a lovely tribute to the spirit of the life force in all of us--even those of us not made of metal. See this. It is one of the better movies of the year.",8,0,0,7 February 2000
Mary and Max," What a Lovely, Touching Film
","I accidentally ordered this film on Netflix. How very serendipitous. This is one of the most creative and touching things I've seen. First of all, the creation of what could have been passed off as grotesques, begin to make their ways into our souls. Both Mary and Max are lost souls who have demons. They are also optimistic, given the hands that have been dealt them. Through circumstances, they have beliefs in the realities of humanity that are so innocent. For example, where to babies come from. Mary has never really had a friend and ends up making contact with Max when she tears his name off the bottom of a telephone book page. They correspond between Australia and New York. They have been bullied and pushed around their whole lives. Max has issues with depression and self esteem. Mary has a mother from hell. Of course, these are clay characters, but when bad things happened to them, I literally wanted to cry. There is no romantic angle, only two people that need each other desperately. Much of it is so funny, but ultimately a serious take on the human condition.",10,2,6,2 October 2015
Shrek," It's In the Background
","I want this on video so I can watch parts of it selectively. The story is fun, the animation sensational, but seeing it only once in a theater didn't allow me time to scope out all the sight gags. I loved the background images, the schtick that Shrek does because he is an ogre and as gross as they come. But it went by so fast. Since I saw a stage version of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, I have thoroughly enjoyed films and plays that have a bunch of significant action going on around the characters that are currently being focused on. The 'real' plot, so to speak. The fairy tale world that is the setting of this animated joy, is what I really want to see. These characters, who are parts of lots of little stories, go about their daily business, running from big bad wolves or being left to follow bread crumbs. Meanwhile Shrek, being a kind ogre, must put up with the constant pleas of the fairy tale populace, who make nuisances of themselves.Eddie Murphy's donkey, of course, is the most soul testing of them all with his excessive verbiage and quick wit. Nothing ever enters his brain without immediately going to his mouth. This is a fun film, and even if it does go for bathroom humor, it done with great aplomb!",9,0,0,13 September 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Maybe a Little Too Much
","Though there are few films so outwardly violent, the real gold in this film comes from the interaction between Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster. He prowls like a lion, back and forth in his glass cage, muzzled, dangerous. Foster reacts to him as you would someone who could kill you if you looked away for a second. Parry and thrust. As the film develops, a charming kind of standoff occurs. The FBI agent begins to see some humanity in this monster. She needs him, but she needs to trust him first. There are the scenes with the mask and the biting off of noses and other violence, but these show that he is in many ways a cunning beast. He is also a genius. As the profiling goes on, more and more layers of the mystery are cleared and the quarry knows the quarry. Hannibal Lecter is a celebrity brutalizer, and, of course, a cannibal. Hopkins knows few peers in contemporary cinema. His films are almost always worth the time. I doubt if he has ever created anyone like this before.",9,1,2,5 April 2006
Vanilla Sky," It's Quite Innovative and Highly Engaging
","Even if I don't always like Tom Cruise, the man, mainly because of his pomposity and his L. Ron Hubbard stuff, I seem to really enjoy his movies. In this one, his character is much like him. He is not heartless, but not far from it. He is spoiled and entitled. He has expectations of others, including women, that he is the be all and end all. One day his life changes when he is in a car with the Cameron Diaz character, whom he actually exploits. She is willing to kill both of them rather than live without him. What follows is one of the most circumlocative plots, with apparent supernatural elements, dream sequence, cryonics, etc. A criticism of this film would be that it is so bizarrely convoluted, that reality is hard to discern. There is some validity to that, but it also makes it incredibly interesting. Sometimes I'd rather see a director or producer try to exceed their grasp. I would also recommend that the previous film 'Open Your Eyes' is its own film. Must we always try to demean something because it has an antecedent.",9,1,2,11 January 2017
Iron Man," No Iron! How Ironic!
","I got a kick out of this film. I have never seen one of the comic books nor do I know about the exploits of this figure. It is a nicely done superhero film which traces the origins of the character. Robert Downey is quite good, balancing his innate arrogance against his good intentions. Jeff Bridges is also an excellent adversary. One of the most impressive scenes in the move is the opening in the deserts of Afghanistan as a roadside bomb explodes and Downey and a group of soldiers come under fire. It really gives one a sense of what those people face each day. It may even be a bit real for a fantasy romp like this is. It is down and dirty. There are great events, including the building of the first suit and his effort to exact revenge against the forces that have used his weapons systems to persecute and destroy the civilian population. There is a lot of action and it's not superfluous. Downey's relationship with Gwyneth Paltrow and the robots in his lab are a lot of fun. For pure escapism, it's really fun. I assume the sequel is on its way.",8,1,3,6 November 2009
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Endlessly Endless
","This film is so long and confusing. Apparently, I needed to see a movie before this one, so I could understand why the people of Metropolis are so ticked at the Man of Steel. Apparently, when trouble comes, he has the decision as to who is going to die. Even if it's not intentional, there is so much collateral damage that people see him as playing God. Batman has flashbacks to when his parents were murdered. People are up in arms. Meanwhile, Batman continues to blame Superman for a God complex. Lex Luther, played as a psychotic by Jessie Eisenberg, is orchestrating everything to get the two into a battle to the death. What his reasons are are not clear. But it seems one-fourth of the movie is that battle. It goes on and on and on. Luther has gotten Kryptonite into the hands of Batman and later drums up some monster. Got, I don't know where all that came from. Oh, by the way, Wonder Woman shows up. I suppose to shill for her movie. What a crock this is. I got caught up in the first half and it fell to the ground in the second.",4,4,12,23 December 2016
Blade Runner," Are We This Cruel?
","I understand that things were done to the original film which I saw in a movie theater. It's been so long that I have no basis for comparison. Watching the Director's cut, I found it as engaging as I remember. It's sad when we have a hero who is basically a cold blooded murderer. The evil rest with ourselves. Can we really destroy a sentient being and have a moral justification. Once these replicants began to think for themselves, do we lose our right to them. Think of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as Victor chases the monster across the ice. The creature cries out to him as his maker that he is part of him. These are seen as monsters, but they have no control over what they have become. Their memories are theirs, even though they were implanted. This is such a bleak view of our future and it plays very well in 2010. It is a feast for the eyes and is much better science fiction than most films made since. Ford's performance is intense and driven. This is an excellent film. I was curious why Leonard Maltin gave it one-and-a-half stars.",9,0,2,22 January 2010
Bruce Almighty," What Would You Do As God?
","I suppose what this film is saying is that given the opportunity Bruce is given, the natural thing to do is to act entirely selfishly, feathering your own nest, and being crass and insensitive. He uses what he has been given to be self indulgent and selfish. I guess there is some religious message in all this, since God actually appears (the soft spoken Morgen Freeman). I guess because Jim Carrey's persona is at the center, we don't get took see God pick a person who has lapsed into despair over the state of the world, the treatment of women, the abuse of children. Yes, i know it's a comedy, but it has that heavy handed stuff in it that says, 'There is only one way.' Of course, Carrey will eventually have too much of a good thing and abuse his powers because he never had any character to begin with. He learns at the end, but only after he has a bit of guilt for causing death and destruction. Mostly, he is clueless. By the way, is Morgen Freeman an American Christian God or does he represent the world in general? Just asking.",6,0,1,11 January 2017
Mr. Holland's Opus," A Nice Movie About the Importance of the Arts in Schools
","I like the intent behind this film. Having been a teacher for well over forty years, I know that there is a serious connection between success in school and life and arts education. This is a story of a dedicated teacher (although he is dedicated to the exclusion of just about anything else, including his family). He is played by Richard Dreyfuss and he does quite well, although Dreyfuss seems to play the exact same personality in just about everyone of his films. He touched on classical music before as a young pianist in 'The Competition' with Amy Irving. Of course, his superhuman portrayal is almost a bit beyond the efforts of the most dedicated teachers. The one thing I do have trouble with is his close relationship with a couple female students. I know that even in the time of this film, Mr. Holland may not have an opus; he would have had another number in front of his picture. He was playing with fire. But all that aside, it portrays an excited, dedicated person who touched the lives of others.",8,0,1,7 January 2017
The Greatest Showman," Great Fun
","When I saw the first trailer, I thought this would be fun. Then I started reading about it, especially local critics. I'm pretty picky and don't have much time for bad musicals. This pretty much floored me. The songs were pristine. The choreography was creative and fun. The casting worked wonderfully as did the special effects. I'm only taking a point away because it was so utterly contrived. But I thought Jackman and Ephron did yeoman duty as the leads. The circus bits were great. The 'freaks' were engaging and fun. I wished it had a slightly sharper edge and a little more internal conflict, but the message put forth was just fine. Go see it because it is great fun.",9,3,8,28 March 2018
Ben-Hur," Chuck Does a Pretty Good Job
","These Biblical epics were a real part of my childhood. If it wasn't 'The Robe' it was 'The Ten Commandments' or 'The Greatest Story Ever Told.' This, of course, is based on the novel by Lew Wallace. It involves a clash between cultures in the Biblical sense. The Romans are the bad guys because they are like us. The downtrodden, eventual followers of Christ, are the victims. Judah Ben Hur finds himself in the middle, confronting his demons and attempting to save his family. The story is pretty slow moving. As a young person, I thought it was endless, but have since gained more of an appreciation for it. There is a lot of action, especially the celebrated chariot race. One of the more interesting portrayals is of the leper colony. Lepers were always talked about in Sunday school, but we never really understood what this was. Seeing food left at the entrances of caves made quite an impression on my young soul. I guess I recommend this because of its grand purpose and wonderful storytelling. I think as a package, there are much better movies that tell the same story.",8,0,3,12 February 2007
Casino Royale," Here It Is/Where It All Began
","This Bond film is well written and exciting, It shows us the way that the 007 legend began. We find how Bond takes advantage of a situation to make himself the guy with the license to kill. He begins to battle wits with the villain, LeChifre, who is in the center of international finance. He is also a gambler who is managing to make one hundred percent on his investments, Bond has to use every manner of effort to confront the barriers placed before him, including winning at cards. I remember the asinine first Hollywood version of this book, which came in the wake of some of the best 'serious' Bond films. It had comedians Peter Sellers and Woody Allen and more silliness than you could shake a stick at. One thing I noticed is that the card game played was poker. In the book and the original movie, he plays Baccarat. Of course, hardly any Americans understand this game. In the first film there is a dramatic moment when a card is turned over and Bond wins...to this day, I don't know why!",9,1,5,8 January 2017
Toy Story 3," Stunning Story and Animation
","It is a rare treat when an totally fictional creation has the ability to draw the kinds of emotions from one that these characters do. The whole chest of toys is here, each with its wonderful personality, its anxieties, its over-the-top confidence. The creators did not rush into a made for video throw away, but rather looked at the Toy Story mythos and put the characters into a world where they belonged, with the frailties created by the passage of time and different circumstances based on the human component. It is tightly plotted, tugging at our sentiments all the way. It is also uproariously funny. I would stack it against virtually any comedy being made today--a nice departure from the scatological, anything-for-a-laugh stuff that portends to be funny. Don't get me wrong. It's not a perfect film and I'm not dissing all work being done these days, but if this doesn't tug at the heartstrings, I don't know what will.",10,0,1,5 January 2011
Trainspotting," Now I See Why
","I'm an old guy. I'm also a movie fan with an open mind. This is one of those films that is often referred to by critics as being very important. When I read the description of it, my first reactions was to totally avoid it. But it has in it some really great actors and I've been taken with the guy from Elementary. Well, was I surprised. While it was hard to watch as these young men dropped into the depths of addiction, I began to be fascinated by them. They were individuals who had aspirations and lives; they were good and bad. But were continually brought down by their mistakes. Those who say this glorifies drugs have totally missed the point.",9,0,2,16 November 2019
La Vie En Rose," Such a Sad Genius
","It's hard to listen at times to this magnificent singer without knowing the pain and traumatic experiences that she endured. I liked the comparisons with Judy Garland. Such talent that we all wished for, but a huge weight every day. Still, I wish at some point I could have seen her -perform because, like Garland, the privilege of sitting in an audience and seeing them at their best would have been incredible. I have never heard another singer with such a rich, haunting voice as hers. This bio-pic is so well crafted that we forget for a while that these are actors. There is little fat here and if we stay with it, we can't help but leave the theater with heavy hearts.",10,0,0,4 May 2019
Signs," It's Almost There
","I mostly like this movie because the terror is presented in a subtle, weighted way. We learn more about the characters than the threat. Obviously, from the beginning, Mel Gibson's character is carrying around some big guilt and big inertia. So when the threats begin, he can't get off the mark (sort of like the guy in The Patriot). As the signs begin to appear, it is up to him to regain his faith and want to move on. The horrible incident with his wife has made him move away from god. What is missing for me is the uncertainty of what the threat is. It's obvious 'what' it is but not 'why' it is. When the movie concludes, we are left wondering where we will go next. It reminded me a little of Hitchock's 'The Birds.' Is there more out there and who are they and what do they want? Why are they evil and why did they decide to threaten us. Still, like most of this director's movies, it is beautiful to look at and works on most levels. Gibson is back and forth with me. I never have doubted his acting ability. At times I'm not sure what he wants out of a film.",8,0,3,24 March 2006
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Pretentious but Not at All Awful
","Some reviewers once again don't like a film because they don't like Woody Allen. The criticisms are that they don't like the snobby New York intellectuals. The dialogue is heightened--people don't speak that way. Of course, one can take any movie and criticize it for lack of naturalistic purity. Here, two women find themselves out of their elements. They get into things that drive them to act in ways they don't usually. Yes, the men are boring, but that's just a factor. Most people are boring and we marry them and do the best we can. Only one or two women married Errol Flynn or Clark Gable. And we don't even know if their screen personas were the same as their entertainment ones. This movie sets up a situation and lets its figures interact.",7,0,3,4 May 2019
Sweet and Lowdown," Musicians Make Great Characters
","Once again we get to see Sean Penn at his charming and reckless best. I thoroughly enjoyed watching him go into his self destructive mode, losing out on the things that are really important. One could start off thinking of him as an arrogant ass, but then come to realize that he is more insecure than almost anyone. His fear of the looming Django Renihart is pretty cool. Imagine being the second best and knowing it, that is, being so good but not quite there. How many people can tell you who the second man to walk on the moon was? The money comes and the money goes and the man goes on. The cinematography of this film is wonderful, capturing an era when the jazz performer was the king.",8,1,1,26 May 2010
Saving Mr. Banks," I Was Quite Touched
","I don't know what the truth is. I decided long ago to not see movies as historical documents. If that were the case we would dismiss about 95 percent of those films that feature historical figures. I had the misfortune to see 'American Sniper' this past week. If you want to see something playing around with the truth, watch that. Yet there is all this adulation going on. This is a human film which extrapolates a series of events that involved obtaining the movie rights to Mrs. P. L.Travers' book 'Mary Poppins.' She is brought in from Engliand and does everything she can to keep from releasing her baby to the movie mogul Disney. But where this turns into a nice film is the back story. There are intermittent flashbacks to her childhood where she doted on her father, an alcoholic and dreamer. He has trouble with the real world and yet must live in it. He caused great pain to his wife and family but can't kick the disease. Mrs. Travers has become cynical and short and unkind over the years because she seems to have some self-loathing. The movie contains one scene after another where the producers and the writers must walk on eggshells around her. She is explosive and angry all the time. Only when she is alone, do we see her fragility. There were several moments in this film where I got tears. That happens to me so seldom. If the film was manipulative and somewhat inaccurate, they got me, and that's OK. Emma Thompson and Tom Hanks are wonderful as always.",9,1,3,15 January 2016
Fantastic Mr. Fox," It Was Fantastic!
","I have never been so absorbed by a group of animated figures. Even more impressive than the stop action process used here (it must have taken forever), is a delightful set of people/animals that charm us and make us care. As with all Roald Dahl children's books, we get to see the dark side of humanity, no punches pulled. The animals are a combination of their natural propensities and 'human' qualities. The story involves an upwardly mobile fox, voiced by George Clooney, who wants the best for his family, but can't seem to avoid killing chickens or robbing the people who live on the edge of his domain. He is a 'wild animal' and this makes it hard for him to restrain himself. He is also quite irresponsible but so charming that he can talk his way out of anything. Into the mix is his faithful wife (who really gets fed up with him) and a son who is small, aspires to be an athlete, and is in the throes of teenage low self-esteem. A whiz kid cousin come to visit and upsets the apple cart. Ultimately, the actions of Mr. Fox bring about a battle with the dangerous humans and the fun begins. This is a delight to look at. Even if you're not into 'children's' animated films, I became totally absorbed.",9,0,1,13 October 2010
Thor: The Dark World," Superior Fun
","Chris Hemsworth again becomes the focus of the Marvel saga. This is a delightful feast for the eyes and a masterful story. I'm an old guy and my tastes run all over the place, but I was taken in from he start As I've said before, people are taking their times with these films, not throwing out some cheap sequel to get a quick buck. Once again the setup is very well done. Loki is in prison in what looks like the city zoo. He rests in squalor, waiting his turn to return to power. He is a master of misdirection and disguise, so we never know when we can trust him. The answer, of course, is never. Still, for me, he is the most engaging of all the characters. He is a perpetual thorn in the side of everyone. He is the incarnation of the true Norse character, the trickster. The plot is really interesting. Ultimately, we must get to earth because all the adventure above the ground becomes a bit distant to us mortals. The researchers, including Natalie Portman's character (who has fallen big time for Thor and he for her), continue to try to figure out a way to understand the workings of this netherworld. An array of fun characters, most carried over from the first film as well as the Avengers, parry and thrust their way. Despite the grave consequences of their actions and those of the gods, there is a great deal of tongue in cheek humor and surprising twists that make it more than a bunch of characters trying to beat each other to a pulp. This is a very engaging film.",9,1,6,3 December 2013
Lucy," Good Setup But Gets Bogged Down and Generally Uninteresting
","I agree with a couple of previous reviewers. To maintain real interest, we really need some conflict. I don't mean a bunch of Korean guys chasing after you. It has to be a problem the protagonist has to solve or at least deal with. Lucy unfortunately helps a friend and ends up in really deep stuff. She is used as a drug mule for a crazy drug that can up human intelligence. She was never intended to use but a guy assault her and breaks the bag inside her. She immediately begins to divide cells and transform into a new creature. The second criticism is a lack of explanation as to why she loses all compassion and empathy. She does have the revenge thing going but she is almost zombie like in her interactions with others. Is the point that we are just animals with reproductive and survival instincts? Other than teaching his classes and giving us a reference point, Morgan Freeman is of no use. He just stands around saying he doesn't know anything. Lucy eventually takes us on a ride through time but why. Is she just absorbing information. If so, what is she going to do with it. The long and short is that it is disjointed and relatively pointless.",6,0,3,25 April 2016
Amélie," She. Captivates Us All
","There seems to be a movement afoot to diminish ratings on films, even if they are reasonably good. So someone looks at the 250 best films list and rather than actually review and give any sort of subjective review, they give it a one so they can sabotage the rating. This is a charming movie. It's not for everyone, but it is creative and kind and has a wonderful love story. Criticize a away, but to call a person with a desire to do good, even if she invades the spaces of people, a psychopath! Really. I guess that's the curse of the public forum. For those actually interested in the movie, it involves a young woman who has been sheltered by her parents. When the mother is killed by a falling body, she is left to her own designs. Her father is cold and disinterested and she must fend for herself. She becomes an observer of life and begins to formulate her own being. Her decision making is based on her personal journey and, in some cases, a lack of real education. She is a waif but only wants to do good. One of the most creative and loving movies ever produced.",10,4,7,9 January 2017
Moonrise Kingdom," Whimsical and Sharp!
","I will be really interested to see next year's Academy Awards, especially the one for cinematography. This is a course in that subject. The camera plays with everyone and is the trued hero in this film. Once I realized that this was not a conventional movie, but one with quirky characters and deep psychology overtones, I settled back and was mesmerized. This is the story of a couple misfits, caught in a claustrophobic world where they don't belong. They come form a dysfunctional ethos but maintain dreams they don't understand. They manage to persevere despite the odds against them. This is a lovely film with some of our best actors: Frances McDormand, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, all caught up in their own debilitating existences and trying to move from one day to the next. This is one of those gems that come along once in a blue moon. It is full of charm, wit, kindness, pain, and a whole hose of characters you will have a hard time forgetting.",9,2,3,17 July 2012
The Sixth Sense," It Really Captured My Attention
","I rented this and watched it around midnight a couple years ago. This film, like 'Poltergeist,' has contributed a line to the eternal world of cinema: 'I see dead people.' I will not spoil this for someone that has not seen it. My comments are on the craftsmanship that is this film. It starts with Haley Joel Osment, who will go down as one of our great child actors. He has the vulnerability and pain that expresses itself so well. His continual bouts with his 'gift' bring him more pain. He gets an ally in Bruce Willis's character, and they begin to face things together. Unfortunately, like most movies that present something supernatural, a set of rules apply to the world and it these rules that make it fairly easy to pull this down. However, I would rather have them craft it as best they can than try to keep consistent in every aspect. Like 'Memento' which I saw pretty close to the same time, I don't want to think too much or the fine fabric of the film starts to unravel. How's that for cowardice?",9,0,0,3 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," An Impressive Blockbuster Film...That Said
","I saw Quentin Tarentino on Stephen Colbert the other night. He pointed out that no matter what movie he's gone to, he always remembers that it is still a movie...that he never falls into the spell to where he forgets. People say they do. He doesn't. I deliberately stayed away from any reviews or comments on this film. But I couldn't avoid all of the hype and that hype, by its very nature, made me constantly aware I was watching a movie that was going to make huge sums of money. I'm having trouble separating myself from that sense of 'why did they do this?' And 'why did they choose her.' And, 'Isn't Harrison Ford a stitch.' Not Han Solo but Harrison Ford. Anyway, I have to admit that I sort of enjoyed it. It has lots of action, some interesting characters, a nostalgic feel, and so on. And a force is a force of course, of course. I skipped work so I could be at the first screening of the first 'Star Wars' film back in 1977. I have to admit that as a reader of much challenging science fiction, I found the whole thing pretty bland. But it is a cultural entity, it bears watching. I don't know that there was much new here that would make one want badly to come back for more. When I saw the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, I marked my calendar, hoping I would live to see all three episodes. And in that one, I already knew the plot. I'll be interested to see how this holds up to the test of time. For me the second set of the films are quite forgettable. And, again, for me, only one of the original caught my interest.",7,15,48,21 December 2015
Cinderella," Story Dull; Some Very Nice Songs
","I've never been as enamored with this film as with other Disney films. First of all, the villains just are laughable. They don't' have the cruelty that they have in other movies. The prince is a dud. He is strictly window dressing, someone for Cinderella to fall in love with. But the real downer is those tiresome mice and their electronically enhanced voices. After a few minutes of them, I've had enough. Even the Fairy Godmother is a dull, undeveloped character. Cinderella's plight in the original fairy tale is hell on earth. Here she is mostly inconvenienced. I know it's animation out of the fifties and Disney is for kids, but when I was young I didn't like this very much. Again, there are some really good songs, including 'A Dream Is a Wish Your Heart Makes.' A theme for the whole Disney enterprise.",7,1,2,3 December 2016
RED," Fun With the Seniors
","This is basically throw away formula and yet it is rather enticing. This is probably because it uses some of Hollywood's most recognizable faces. The plot is unimportant other than to be used to keep things moving toward and end. The film tries to convince us that these older people have lost none of their touch. Some of them are trained killers; others are probably sociopaths. They do have a nice commitment to each other as representatives of a group generally ignored. Nevertheless, like Lancaster in Atlantic City, they work their magic and move quickly and skillfully, doing the job they set out to do. Nothing great. Just an entertaining movie. Willis is his usual smirking self. Freeman works his usual magic. The lady is nuts. Take it to the bank.",7,2,4,22 May 2012
Flight," The Spoils of Addiction
","Having found myself in the middle of situations created by alcoholics often during my life, I found Denzel Washington's portrayal of such an alcoholic spot on. From accentuating an amazing single accomplishment to the utter denial of his condition, I believe he was spot on. He is such a good actor, willing to play a heavy with a soft edge, yet stay true to character, that at times it is hard to dislike him. I truly disliked his character throughout; his arrogance, self satisfaction, and smugness really aroused my senses. If there's a criticism, it's more with the formulaic plot, the deck stacking, the carelessness of those who surround these people. Nevertheless, when one's greed and other motivations play a factor, they can lead to unpredictability, so I guess this is forgivable. This is a movie about contrition.

Kagemusha," Another Brilliant Epic
","This is a great epic of war and a film of great emotion. At the center is a man who has nothing. He is thrust into a world he didn't create. He is a petty thief and really would like to just get on with his life. What he also has is great loyalty to his now deceased lord, and despite his great concern for his ability to carry it off, he agrees to the position. He has to know that at some point this will all come crashing down. The Samurai code makes it so that he has few options. He runs the war the best he can but occasionally falls victim to who he is. Even with advisers watching his every move, he becomes so much a part of the entire picture that he is left to destroy himself, and, in the process, the clan that he represents. The battle scenes are remindful of the other huge films like 'Ran' and 'Throne of Blood.' They sweep across the screen with the flag carrying horsemen and the infantry fighting until there is nothing left but total carnage. Because of the complexity of the story and the wonderful acting, I would put this at or near the top of my Kurosawa list.",10,25,27,23 September 2009
Rear Window," It's In the Garden
","Jimmy Stewart does what many would do.  Because of a badly broken leg and probably because he's not a fan of television in the 1950's, he takes his photographic equipment and scans the scenery.  It so happens that the city has million stories and he becomes involved in about a dozen of them, including Raymond Burr, who has probably murdered his wife.  Enter Grace Kelly, the loyal girlfriend, and things begin to role.  Being a moral man except for his voyeurism, he eventually discovers something that pushes him into action.  Once he combated boredom; now he knows a terrible secret, but he must get his facts in order.  He pushes the envelope so many times, putting his accomplice in danger, but he must know soon or he will get himself killed. 	The suspense is built from the opening credits to the concluding scenes. As Stewart assembles his evidence and Burr begins to suspect something, it puts us on the edges of our seats.  Stewart and Kelly are so vulnerable, he with his disability, she with the inability to leave the cul de sac she has entered.  Once the criminal suspects, he has no choice; he is desperate, and then we have a climax that is worthy of the very best of Hitchcock.  It is exciting and satisfying, no stones left unturned, literally.  See this if you never have!",9,0,2,5 October 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," I lived to see them all!
","I am in awe of the knowledge of some of the reviewers. I've been disappointed with virtually every film version of a beloved book that I have seen. I have not studied 'The Lord of the Rings' though I have read the trilogy twice and parts several times. I know what a scholar Tolkien was and admire his work in linguistics as well as storytelling. The two entities do not need to cross over. If one really wanted to make the book you would have about two hours of poetry and a 56 hour movie. Movie-making is, unfortunately, forced to play by different rules. First of all, this film could not have been made until now. Imagine people dressed as trees. Remember those old Superman serials where whenever the Man of Steel flies, he becomes animated. Now that is genuinely bad. What Peter Jackson did here will be his legacy; had he died the day the film was complete, he would go down in film history. Everything is set up. The ring must be returned. Frodo is drunk with power and is latched on by the forces of evil. Those continuing the quest must face the ultimate and some do. Gollum is in the way, using his wiles to drive the ring back to him. The visual magnificence of Mount Doom and Mordor are unbelievable. One thing that is never mentioned is the incredible acting of most of the characters. Jackson may be a master of spectacle, but Frodo's character is a mass of impulses and expressions. He believes he is going to die and is afraid. Do you see a little bit of Christianity mixed in here? I'm not going down that road because, of course, the Bible is an epic too and has its own story. This is a movie about how friendship, loyalty, and sacrifice will out against evil. The evil is so remarkable and so oppressive.I can't begin to talk in the terms of other reviewers, but I do need to make sure that I weigh in on this film and the other two because this is a product of our society that we can all be proud of.",10,2,4,16 March 2006
Pitch Perfect," Just Not Very Good!
","I'm not here to rain on someone's parade. If you enjoy this kind of stuff, it's OK with me. But I don't understand how something so inane could be so popular. It fails on so many levels. First of all, there is absolutely no realistic character development. These kids are just boring. They are types, thrown together because of their quirkiness, their ethnicity, their race, or even their sexual preference. The sad thing is that doing this doesn't lead to anything interesting. Ooh! You mean a fat girl could actually be talented!! I'll admit they have good voices, but so does everyone else in this film. So, where's the conflict? The leader threw up as they were performing for a national championship and is trying to get a second chance? Then there's the sullen main character. I got tired of her and her whiny portrayal in about five minutes. I couldn't care less if they won because I didn't like any of them. Throw in those boorish idiot commentators who never say one funny thing the whole show, and it becomes a snoozefest. A couple numbers are OK but there is no suspense or interest built up. When the big face off comes, we don't wonder for a second what is going to happen.",4,6,10,15 June 2015
The Truman Show," Black Comedy
","'The Truman Show' is about as depressing as anything I know.  It is about a society that is so jaded that the interactions in their lives are wholly inadequate--they prefer a fictionalized world to their own.  What is really sad is that this began in the fifties with 'Father Knows Best' and 'Leave It to Beaver' and exists now in the tiresome parade of sitcoms with their vacuous double entendres and empty lives marching across the screen. Whose wholesomeness, whose sexual manifestations are these?  With children gunning each other down in schools--desensitized to common respect (and I'm not just talking violence but respect for anything) to mindless, thoughtless pursuits of gratification.  We are the idiots watching 'The Truman Show.'  The greatest tragedy is that what might be looked at as outrageous is actually occurring every day--we just haven't put artificial walls around our little town.Jim Carrey is quite good--he can shine those pearly whites at the camera with the best.  But couldn't it have been anyone?  His efforts to free himself are not of significant because it can all be rewritten anyway.  His obstacles are not important because it isn't the actors who are staging this--it's on the other side of the cardboard.  For a movie which qualifies as modern fantasy, this is anything but.",7,1,1,18 May 1999
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," OK! You Got Me!
","I was pretty indifferent to the first film. Because I wasn't on board with the younger people who have embraced the books, I felt kind of empty when I saw it. One small criticism is that the characters don't seem to have much say in what happens to them. Because they are viewed so closely, they can't even plot against the evil forces that have brought them to where they are. What I failed to take into account is that this is a three-book series and needs to be viewed as such. While I found the sequel really talky at times, the constant barriers being put forth by the forces in power, absolutely drain us as we hope for the best. The hardest thing for me to deal with is that only a single survivor can be had. This forces alliances and betrayal (much like most reality shows but with much more dire consequences). The saving grace for HG2 is that the characters are so much more interesting. They have become more human with human feelings, despair and love. I must have liked it because every time I saw that emcee with his white teeth flashing, I wanted him dead. The same with Donald Sutherland who reminded me of the James Bond character with the kitten. So, there go my emotions of revenge. Had a group of people not brought me to this film, I would probably have not bothered with it. Now, I will definitely see the next one to see how everything shakes out.",8,1,19,3 December 2013
The Matrix," Wow! I Finally Saw It!
","This is one of those movies that 'everyone' has seen, except me. I tried to watch it with some friends about fifteen years ago, but they had two kids under five years old and I was only able to ingest it in five minute increments. So a friend lent me the video and I finally got a chance to see it. It's a pretty remarkable film. The premise of an alternative reality works here where it often fails. Keanu Reeves is a sort of messiah, not by his own choosing originally. He has been attacked and abused by men in sunglasses whom, we find out later, are a part of a representation of Artificial Intelligence. The side Neo ends up on are the original humans whose ranks have been nearly driven to extinction. Laurence Fishburne is the leader of the rebels and he believes the the Reeves character is 'the One.' I thoroughly enjoyed it but would have like a little more creative final scene. Too many shell casings. Apparently, weaponry didn't advance much in twenty years. But, it keeps one on edge with its special effects and its non-stop action.",9,1,2,20 August 2019
Godzilla," Apparently You Love It or Hate It
","I have to say I was disappointed with this film. I was so intrigued by the first half hour as we were brought into the events in a secret facility in Japan. One of the directors watches his wife die after a nuclear breech. Now we cut into the future. The director is still out there. He has become a crusader against the secrecy of this type of research. His son, who lost his other in the earlier incident, has become military and is really annoyed with his father's campaign. Now we throw all that aside. Dad has evidence, but has been arrested for treasonous acts. They see him as more of a nuisance than anything, but they have their own fish to fry. He manages to get back to the house where they lived (which is in rubble) and recover some old floppy disks. During this time, some sort of huge flat headed flying creature with spider legs has come to life. It is causing incredible destruction. Godzilla, who apparently is no secret, is moving around in the ocean. He is on a collision course with these other things. While the special effects are good, there is something really lacking in the story line, in the fights themselves, in the whole attitude toward these monster, and just a sort of malaise. I came to the theater excited because at midnight in 1957, I stayed up past my bedtime to her Raymond Burr in the Americanized version of 'Godzilla' talk about the destruction of Tokyo. I have since watched so many of these movies, including the forgettable Matthew Broderick one, and I had hoped for some kind of earth shattering, apocalyptic presentation. For me, it was just an ordinary monster movie with little new to offer.",6,3,5,30 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Maybe I Never Got It
","I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie.  Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing 'Star Wars' (boy have times changed!).  There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere.   How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don't know, but we did. I still have my blue button with 'May the Force be With You' emblazoned on it.  I'm told it's pretty valuable.  A reporter approached us and asked my friend, 'What do you expect.'  He responded in his sort of wise ass way, 'A sprawling intergalactic epic.'That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for.  Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction.  As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western.  It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged.  Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting.  I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me.  I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie.  As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post.  Where did these guys get their training?  How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read 'Dune' years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book, I'll never know.  I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic.  The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie.  Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday.",9,0,1,16 November 2001
Cloud Atlas," One of the Most Interesting Experiences Ever
","This is one of those experiences that defy explanation (similar to the one I had watching '2001: A Space Odyssey'). I had read the book a year before and if you had asked me to pick a book that could never be made into a movie, I would have easily selected this. How wrong I was. This masterful concoction kept me intrigued for nearly three hours and yet I'm still trying to figure things out. I agree with the late Roger Ebert that even with two or three viewings, I am still trying to put this all together. It doesn't matter. It's like looking at a painting on repeated visits to a museum, maybe the works of Breughel or Bosch. There are some themes that run through the multiple characters' existences, touching on oppression and endurance of the human soul. The performances are wonderful. I would imagine that the likes of Tom Hanks must have been in heaven, extending their acting chops. I need to watch the film again, but for now will leave it to those more intellectually astute to look at the implications of the tenets of this film. I would recommend it as an experience everyone should have.",10,4,9,18 March 2014
Thirteen Days," Perhaps the Closest We've Ever Come
","I was in ninth grade when upon arriving home from school, my mother told me we may in the middle of a nuclear war. The Cold War had reach its climax and a rash act by the Russian hierarchy shoved the gravest danger in the face of John F. Kennedy, still wet behind the ears. This film really captures some of the intricacies of that historical moment. While Kevin Costner's character is a bit much, we get to see the tension that existed in the global community and behind the closed doors of the White House. As the two powers parry and thrust, we realize the consequences. There is so much posturing in politics, but when the price is destruction, or at best, invasion, the stress meter goes all the way to the right. I have to say that the portrayals of the politicians of the time was nicely done (as was the military). We tend to oversimplify things in our smugness as Americans, but imagine having to make the decisions these men made. It is an ultimate chess match which has the face- saving piece hanging over it. This is all pulled off nicely. Also, I never knew what Adlai Stevenson's role was in all this. He just seemed like the intellectual presidential candidate that lost twice to Eisenhower. See this.",8,0,0,2 June 2011
Ran," A Masterpiece of War and Greed
","This is film that everyone needs to see. It brings home the horrors of war, betrayal, and greed. When the kingdom is divided among the sons in this version of King Lear, we just know that the person who bares himself honestly is going to become an outsider. The acting is sensational, with masterful personal encounters. Kurosawa even managed to keep the fool as an integral part of the story. Others have eloquently dissected this movie. What I have to offer is that there is such a poetry to the visual aspects of this film. While the battle scenes are among the goriest and grizzliest that have ever been put on celluloid, there is a dance here, a wave of the most intense coming and going as we watch the soldiers fall. It tells how potentially good men can be influenced by the forces of evil. The wife of the first son is purely vengeful, and horrifying. She is nearly a carbon copy of the woman who played the wife of Mifune's Macbeth character in 'Throne of Blood.' I have been reviewing the Kurosawa canon and am convinced that this may be his finest work.",10,2,5,16 September 2009
Tarzan," Very Nicely Done Version
","Having seen almost every Tarzan film ever made, including the Elmo Lincoln one, I have to give Disney their due. This one catches the spirit and the story of the Tarzan epic. But what is the very best is the music. Phil Collins' songs and the animation that goes with it are quite remarkable. Tarzan is a kind-hearted brute who needs to get away from his connection to the apes so Jane will become his. Of course, there is the usual hunter, driven to destroy everything that can breathe. There is the struggle for Jane because of her connection to her previous life. As time goes by, there are adventures where the big guy has to face death in order to make his way to a status he didn't even know existed. The animals and the minor characters provide significant roles, so this works pretty well. There is one scene where Tarzan cruises through the trees like he's on a skateboard. I wish they would trash this kind of stuff, because putting a 1990's twist on it diminishes its effectiveness. Otherwise a really nice film.",9,1,1,31 December 2016
The Thin Red Line," War in the Head
","It's hard to imagine what it is like to wake up every morning knowing it could be your last. I saw a young man on 60 MInutes last night who has become the first recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor in a great many years. He struck me as one of those incredibly thoughtful, self-sacrificial young people who have trouble saying it was I who did this. He considered himself a mediocre soldier. I could also see that this guy is damaged goods. He is going to carry some demons around for a long time from being in this horrible valley in Afghanistan, perhaps the deadliest location of the war. So when we see this movie that deals with Guadalcanal and the horrible situations these men find themselves facing, we have to realize that war is a cerebral as well as a physical event. That's why soldiers are dehumanized in basic training because if they really thought deeply about the killing of other humans, it would be a hard sell. As brave as the men in the movie are, we seldom get to hear their true thoughts. This is a really cerebral movie. Unfortunately, at times it does get pretty tepid. Yes, there is a lot of grass blowing and people pressed to the ground. Nonetheless, it gets at the deep horror of war. There are anti-war movies superior to this one, but it still holds up quite well.",8,1,3,15 November 2010
Green Book," I Was Captivated
","I saw Don Shirley perform in college in 1966. At the time I simply thought he was a hell of a pianist, using that bass and cello to come up with a unique sound. So when this movie came along, I thought 'I saw that guy!' I know the critics are being hard on this film, but I sat for two hours, totally captivated. I know there are stereotypes. Could that be because the repeated actions against minorities and the actions of racists have become so commonplace they seem like stereotypes. I believe the performances of these two fine actor made the show. There is a subtlety to this movie that transcends many others of its type. Yes, there are Southern cops; yes, there are men's rooms that are off limits; yes, there are simplistic views of racism by white New Yorkers. But what I got was a realistic presentation of an evolving friendship. Shirley is abrasive and self-centered; Lip is clueless most of the time. And I believed in them. See this film.",10,390,465,19 January 2019
The Great Escape," It's Great Escapist!
","I guess we can all call Hollywood to task for its war movies. Until recently, they were pretty sanitized. Did you ever see a John Wayne movie where his buddies were beheaded or dismembered. People die in a nice peaceful way, usually throwing their arms in the air, slinging their guns behind them. We don't even see the wound. When 'The Great Escape' came out, this was pretty much the case. The other prisoner of war movie to gain popularity with the general population was 'Stalag 17' with Robert Ryan as the bad guy. Does it matter. If we are going to stretch reality anyway, can we make our Germans the way we want them. We can make our allied prisoners experts in various types of demolition and subterfuge. With that understood, we now create a magical effort to fool those bad guys and make a grand escape from the prison camp. The writers did a nice job, building suspense and anticipation. Enough roadblocks are thrown up to make it fun. And, of course, this is a real prison camp with real guards and real bullets. No one should look at the ripoff mentality of 'Hogan's Heroes' and think that there is a comparison. As one writer said, the Germans would not have been too happy with what was going on and wouldn't have been so careless and so dumb. Nevertheless, like any adventure movie worth its salt, this is great fun.",8,1,5,5 April 2006
Click," Pretty Dismal!
","I have to start out by saying that I've never seen an Adam Sandler movie that I thought was funny. Even when there is a script that will extend him a bit (and I think he has the potential to be funny), it's all overused, sophomoric stuff. The premise is so interesting here; yet the whole thing falls apart. Why can't he act like a real person thrust into this new world? Instead there are cheap laughs, farts in faces, Christopher Walken looking like he doesn't know what to do. The remote that brings about all the problems and the joys, is unpredictable and often makes no sense. Of course, there's 'And then I woke up.' I will continue to give the man a chance, but I really don't think I could sit through this again.",3,3,6,23 April 2007
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," High, No Low, No High, No Low, Comedy
","Let me see. How does one respond to this. There are sight gags galore. The king pretends to ride a horse, while coconut shells are struck together to simulate hoofbeats. This is just the start. Soon an involved discussion about a swallow's ability to transport the said shells ensues. The Pythons then work their ways through the countryside, searching for the Holy Grail. Like most knights, they fall victim at times to temptation. They are also beset on by cows fired from catapults and a man-eating rabbit. they more I write, the more stupid it all sounds. Much of it is dull and murky and overdone (the knights that say 'ni' gets old after a while), but within a couple of minutes, there is another wacky gem, insanely delivered. Of curse, there are also contemporary non-sequiters, including the movie's ending. This is without a doubt one of the silliest movies ever made. Don't ask me to explain it.",10,2,3,16 November 2001
Aladdin," A Story With Teeth and Great Songs
","This is part of the Disney winning streak of wonderful animated films. It is the familiar story of the young boy who finds a magic lamp that allows him to converse with a genie. What an amazing choice for the genie as Robin Williams struts his stuff. The genie is the star of this show, but a good villain is also thrown in there. As they battle Jaffar, Aladdin is forced to use all his resources to become what he was intended to be. He must somehow become worthy to marry the princess. He is seen as a poser because of his humble upbringing. He woos her with the song 'A Whole New World,' which is an apt title for what he has to offer. The best animated features have an edge to them, and this is no exception. The animation is fabulous and the story is well conceived.",10,1,1,29 December 2016
A Walk to Remember," Hard Not to Feel It
","This is quite formulaic, but it is skillfully done and quite provocative. It is the story of a 'cool' kid and his relationship with a classmate. Peer pressure causes him and his friends to mistreat her in the cruel way teens often do. She falls for him and then he betrays her. That's where things really start in this film because this young woman has a secret. What evolves in the relationship with the two is pretty real and quite poignant. The peripheral stuff is a little too contrived to work very well. Sometimes, script writers try to wrap all things up in a package. It's not necessary. All in all, it's a very touching film.",7,1,1,10 January 2017
Inside Llewyn Davis," An Interesting View of a Character No More/No Less
","The Coen's sometimes make small films. They have a frame of reference that others don't. This is the story of a man. If you don't like him, that's not a problem. He is a folk singer. He is doing his thing in a time when that genre was in great demand. But he is also a self-centered, living-day-to-day jerk who leaves messes in his wake. He wants to work, but has a disdainful view of his own accomplishments. He treats people who do kindnesses for him with the same disdain that he uses on strangers. He does nothing to ingratiate himself with the people who could help him. We don't know where he is going and neither does he. He ends up hooking a ride to Chicago with a taciturn driver known only as Johnny-5. In the back is the scene stealing John Goodman. The ten or so minutes in that car are some of the very best. Goodman taunts and pokes (literally, using a cane) Llewyn, calling him Elwyn. He is absolutely brutal and yet hilarious. When Llewyn arrives in Chicago, he has a brief audition with a producer played by F. Murray Abraham, who basically tells him he's okay, but he isn't hearing any money coming from him. This leads to more sidetracking of the old career, landing on more couches, trying to get back into the Merchant Marine, and more failed efforts. I think if those who are so disdainful of this film were to look at it more closely, there is a black humor that really works. The Coens are known for that. If you think that this is a picaresque offering where the main character learns his lesson, you aren't going to get that. Remember the scene in 'Fargo' where the guy is putting the leg in the wood chipper and is scolded by Francis McDormand. He didn't learn anything either.",8,3,5,30 May 2014
Saboteur," Man on the Run
","If one could accuse Alfred Hitchcock of having a formula, it might be the one where a person who is innocent stumbles into a situation where he/she (usually he) is blamed for something he/she didn't do. The cards are stacked against them and it is up to them to prove their innocence. It often involves extensive travel with a companion who distrusts them at first (prototype 'The Thirty-Nine Steps). In this one, a saboteur in a plant gets himself killed and the protagonist, Robert Cummings, gets blamed for what happens. He is pursued by the law, captured, handcuffed, but manages to free himself. He pursues the evildoer to New York City where we have one of the most famous scenes in all of cinema, involving the Empire State Building. Of course, King Kong played that venue earlier. At times this lacks the sparkle of some of Hitch's films, but it still has a great deal of suspense an excitement.",7,0,1,18 December 2016
Gangs of New York," Don't Think of It as History
","There is certainly a lot of carnage. There's also a little confusion as to motivation. However if you don't try to look at this as an accurate portrayal of history and treat it as a bit of a fantasy, it plays quite well. We have wonderful adversaries who posture and primp. It was more of a nineteenth century gangster film (a little Godfather thrown in) and a tribal sort of thing with all the ritual and righteousness. Lets face it, it's just a bit much, including the Hollywood ending. It did remind me a bit of the Kurosawa movies where there is not a spot unbloodied ground left after the battle scenes. Daniel Day-Lewis is charismatic. He is the reason I would watch this movie again. He absolutely eats up every scene he's in. DeCaprio is a bit boring to me. What he represents is a lot more than what he does. Never got into him. Nonetheless, it's big and impressive with great cinematography. Did anything really get settled. I don't know.",8,0,2,13 October 2009
Joy," It's Not That Bad
","Some people have really gotten riled up about this film. I love to watch Jennifer Lawrence, so I give it the benefit of the doubt from the beginning. This, of course, is the story of a smart woman who has done only things for the family, only to be used and abused by them. She has finally had enough and decides to move on an idea for a new kind of mop that will revolutionize housecleaning. The problem is getting connected with someone who will notice what she has done. She goes through all kinds of trials and pain and finally hits it big on QVC. However, there are people out there who know how to manipulate things to make life miserable for a neophyte. The problem with this movie is that nearly everyone is a jerk, only in things for themselves. Also, there is a kind of 'deus ex machina' ending that makes things all hunky dory. I still haven't figured quite how she lands on her feet at the end and what the threat was. Still, it moves along pretty well and keeps one's interest. I did feel, however, that she should have shed the whole bunch of people who tried to stop her along the way.",7,2,4,12 September 2016
Moon," Something to Think About for a Change
","Yes it is derivative, but there is no secret about that. It's as if 2001 was moved into the future and now the exploiters of both resources and humanity have found a way to ply their trade. It took some time to get involved in this and, of course, when dual identities begin to happen, we need to regroup. The acting is fantastic. Having just the voice of Kevin Spacey is quite novel. In 2001, HAL showed some compassion, but had a heart of stone. His programming was limited. Here, the computer has involved a compassionate side. I don't know if this is truly explained other than it begins to analyze the needs of those he protects. When the newer Outer Limits series appeared on HBO, there was an episode where the memories of the central figure were implanted. This had some similarities. It also deals with the morality of using clones and sentient creatures as slaves. This is an incredibly thoughtful film. I had not heard about it when it first appeared. I'm glad I took a chance.",9,3,11,17 September 2010

Her," Intriguing Premise....But Do We Care?
","I personally think that current technology has produced the ultimate emasculation. Looking into the future (which may be very much what this movies portends), I see an earthwide pack of people who have no connection to one another. The character portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix is really hard for me find sympathy for. He is a whiny guy who can't get off the mark. He finds himself dropping into the safe arms of an operating system. He has been unsuccessful in his marriage and walks around feeling sorry for himself. Once he hooks up with Samantha (the OS), things get really weird, but apparently anyone with a few bucks to invest in these things gets to be a part of this world. He becomes so enamored with this modern version of an inflatable sex toy that he actually begins to believe they can have a life together. If Samantha were truly sentient (which she seems to be aspiring to) he would have bored her to death. He become jealous of Samantha, never coming to grips that she is circuitry, sophisticated as that may be. There are some interesting scenes. If he needed something to drive him further inward, watch the blnd date scene. There is also the utter embarrassment as he tells his wife about Samantha. This is a groundbreaking movie, I guess, but we all know what is going to eventually happen. What we wonder about is, where will he be now? Where will everyone be?",7,0,2,12 January 2015
Slumdog Millionaire," Sprawling Humanity
","I am always hesitant to see a movie after hearing all the hype. I was wondering if the Film Academy had just kind of decided to go in a different direction (as they often do). I was greatly moved by this film and the story of the young man who overcomes not just the horrors of his existence but the prejudice drummed up by those who assume he must be too stupid to do well. l was greatly impressed by the squalor and the long shots of the city. This movie shows the slums so well. It reminded me of the Casbah, where one lives in a maze and can find his way around in it when being chased. These kids are products of their culture and know no other way. There are so many scenes that are so impressive. The boy who drops into the excrement of the outhouse so he can get an autograph of his favorite actor. The horrors of the Fagin character who exploits children, makes them a band of beggars. There is, mostly, however, the story of the central figure who is complex and worldly and suspicious and brave beyond his own years. The other mass character is the Indian people who begin to follow the boy's successes on 'Who Wants to Be a Millionairre.' I will never forget the portrayal of the city and the filth and the spirit that runs through here. This is masterful storytelling.",9,1,6,1 September 2009
Mad Max: Fury Road," It Never Stops
","I have to say that I tried really hard to like this. But my old fashioned 'There needs to be a story and interesting characters' mode took over. It took about fifteen minutes to figure out who was who. Apparently, the guy with the death mask and the tubes was seen as a god, that there was some religious following. Could be interesting, I guess. But what follows is one chase after another with every conceivable vehicle that some guy could dream up. There were porcupine cars. Monster trucks. Guys on poles dropping into vehicles. There was no logic presented as to why one vehicle would have a spear thing thrown at it and explode while others were hit with heavy artillery and seemed to move on just fine. Then we have Mad Max who is a captive with a mask that looks like a 1955 Oldsmobile grill. He is put on the front of a vehicle as all this combat goes on. Unfortunately, he has absolutely no personality whatsoever. There was never any suspense in this film because the place they were trying to get to was never really in our mind's eye. Then there's the short crop haired female which seems to be a standard these days. Make her look masculine and she becomes more formidable. Anyway, it is spectacular to look at but when it was over I felt no emotion or satisfaction at all.",5,5,10,12 October 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Stirring War Film
","The resistant soldier has been a theme for many films over the years. The young man here who serves as a medic has several good reasons for not carrying a gun. Apparently, putting yourself into harms way, unarmed is not adequate to keep you from being tormented. This could have been a cliche, but the acting is superb, the effects amazing, and the pacing works wonderfully. Basing it on an actual Medal of Honor recipient gives it a little push ahead of most others.",9,1,1,28 October 2019
The Breakfast Club," Just a Little Over the Top
","I'm not as enamored with this film as some of the previous reviewers. There is no subtlety to it. It's as if a group of people went into a room and decided on what types to throw into the mix. The premise, of course, is a group of students who are making up detention on a Saturday. The teacher in charge is resentful, so other than an occasional peek into the library where they are wasting the day, he has little, if anything, to do with them. What follows is an interaction among just about every type of kid there is in a high school. And that's where it falls down because they have little depth. They have been designated, in my opinion, to play their role. We have the spacey girl, the athlete, the nerd, the popular girl, the rebel, the abused, and so on. While their conversations are interesting, it doesn't play to the much more complex kid. It's not a bad movie by any means, but some are seeing it as groundbreaking. It's not.",7,1,2,1 December 2016
Gladiator," Predictable Spectacle
","I never got around to seeing this in the theater. I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.",7,1,2,23 October 2001
Contact," It Works at Many Levels
","I enjoyed the hopefulness of this movie--the metaphysical angle. '2001: A Space Odyssey' will always be my favorite science fiction film because it took the stance that there are layers in our evolutionary process--the temporary life that Arthur C. Clarke describes in 'Childhood's End'--that leads to a passing of what we would call 'soul' for lack of a better word. 'Contact' renews this. If one looks at the issues of the universe--we are as likely to go inward as outward. Quantum physics teaches us that uncertainties are as likely as certainties. Otherwise, why build the machine? Does it merely offer us movement into the endless void, or does it bring us to new awakenings? I hope that what we are is destined for better things than a frozen sphere, floating in space for tens of billions of years.Like so many movies, this one forces us to take its premise on faith--there are so many issues unresolved--and the whole thing is so cynical. But it forces us to look at issues of self and the future--that makes it worth our time. And it doesn't necessarily have to do with conventional religion.",8,1,5,18 May 1999
Donnie Darko," Worth a Second Look
","This is a film that crept up on me. It takes one time to sense the rhythms of this film and to accept the strange apparitions that dominate it. As the closing song, 'Mad World,' typifies, the central character can only accept his demons and, in doing so, have a scintilla of joy. This is about a different kind of altruism, unstuck in time, that some of us wish we could have. Donnie is a popular guy with all kinds of possibilities. He is loving, smart, and eccentric. His family has him seeing a psychiatrist because his actions due to misunderstood visions have caused him to act violently at times. They love him and want him so badly to sort things out. He finds a soul mate, but she has her own demons and never fully understands what is going on. I can't say much because a first time viewer needs to be kept completely in the dark. I would like to watch this again to see things unfold with foreknowledge. It's one of the most intriguing movies I've ever seen.",9,2,4,22 February 2011
Pocahontas," Folks, It's Not History
","We must start with the foundation statement that this is not an historical retelling of the story of early America. We don't know what went on at that time, so we are off the mark at the beginning. Can you imagine the dark times that were involved in this era, with a group of settlers trying to establish some kind of community, and a Native American presence confused and afraid what was going on. So what Disney did was turn this into a folk tale which oral traditions have been doing forever (e.g. Paul Bunyan or John Henry or, more appropriately, Davey Crockett). I mean they sing and talk to trees. The romance had to be very strained. Throw in the search for gold and the greed, and you have a classic love in the face of barriers story. Also, there are a couple of terrific songs in this film. No, it's not 'The Lion King' but many very good films are not 'The Godfather' either. It doesn't mean they can't stand on their own.",8,1,2,2 January 2017
The Social Network," Zuckerberg the Great?
","I had to go into this with a grain of salt. The Facebook phenomenon is quite amazing and has made changes to our society that we will be dealing with for decades. That said, I don't put Zuckerberg in the same room with Thomas Edison. The fact is that if Facebook had never been created, the world would have gone on just fine. Perhaps it would be a better, more humane world. One where people don't spend their lives producing tons of personal garbage that is really of no interest. The word 'friend' has taken on a whole new meaning. It sounds then that because of personal bias, I wouldn't like the movie. I did. It's intriguing to watch this twerp hit all the right notes and put into action the phenomenon that has taken place. I really felt like I was in the room with these guys; that I participated in their discoveries and plans. Jesse Eisenberg is so believable that whenever I see Zuckerberg on television, I think, 'Wow, he looks a lot like Jesse Eisenberg!' I can't buy the criticism that this movie is exploitative. If this story was going to be told, it had to be told now because the events are as fleeting as that computer you bought last week. It helped me to understand what went on. I recently saw Mark Zuckerberg bemoaning the failures of our schools. I think that he and his ilk are as much responsible as any poor teacher or principal. The numbing of America (or world) isn't helping much. But this film allows us to have a view of it's potential undoing.",9,0,1,22 May 2012
The Pursuit of Happyness," Much More Than I Expected.
","Seeing the pain in Will Smith as he jockeys for position in a dead-end world is certainly worth the price of admission. This is the tale of a man who has been dealt a bad hand by life, but has never had the courage to start over. He goes from hospital to clinic, trying to sell a bone density scanner that really offers little new to the science of diagnosis. When he ends up as sole support of his little boy, he must change his life. He has seen the happy faces of stock brokers leaving their jobs with smiles on their faces, he decides this is what he would like to do. He has an amazing mind for mathematics and feels he can parlay this gift into a career. The problem is he must continue to eat and find a place to live. There are times when things get maudlin and a bit far fetched, but it does grab at the heartstrings and does present a man who faces off against forces we've all dealt with. It's an unfair world and the haves really become obvious to the have-nots. The acting is superb and overcomes the the plot's weaknesses. Smith's young son is a quite a charmer. He is at times bullheaded and immovable. At times he's a bit too good to be true. It's a very nice movie overall, with a good message. Maybe that's all it should aspire to be.",8,6,10,3 January 2007
Back to the Future," So Much Fun
","Lots of tongue in cheek. Some great characterization. A chance at redemption. These movies showed Michael J. Fox to be a wonderful comedic presence. It is sad what happened to him, but can there be a more impressive example of a person who has overcome the tribulations that life has given him. Whenever I see him in 'The Good Wife' as the slimy, underhanded character lawyer he plays, I love that I can 'not like' a man who is dealing with devastating Parkinson's. As the principle character in this movie, Marty is shoved from one situation to another in a time he only can guess at. He has to face the youth of his father, a febrile wimp who gets pushed around. Then, of course, there is the wonderful Christopher Lloyd as the professor. While one could never accuse this film of being true science fiction with all the implications of time travel, there is a kind of suspense that works very well. It's pure fun and is the best of the three films in my opinion.",9,3,4,15 July 2014
Goodfellas," A Real Portrayal of All That Is Bad
","I generally back away from gangster films. It's not my favorite genre. I have trouble with the aggrandizement of this amoral subcult. This, however, is a masterpiece. It's almost documentary in its portrayal of this society of evil. Martin Scorsese has assembled the cream of the crop of actors who have cut their teeth on the successors of the Godfather. I can't begin to do justice to all the actors in this film. What I can attest to is the danger that lurks in every scene. In one scene the hard wired character played by Joe Pesci (marvelous and crazy) shoot a guy named 'Spider' for not getting him the right drink. The rest of the men must sit there, without compassion, because this is a normal day, with 'normal' events. There is also the second group. The wives and the families who are stuck in the middle of all this, pretending their husbands work nine-to-five jobs, while they are out hitting people. Ultimately, there is Robert de Niro who is the craziest of all. Played with subtle control, he dominates every scene. This is a true masterpiece that's hard to watch.",10,1,2,30 April 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Carries it On
","It doesn't have quite the mystery and intrigue of the first one, but still does a nice storytelling job. Most of the time I wonder who these guys are who are willing to become cannon fodder for a cause. Are they being paid really well. Have they been brainwashed. Are they out of the terrorist/suicide bomber school. They are there to do harm and for whom. This movie keeps a personal slant on this. Bourne deep down inside doesn't want to kill. But he's been put on this roller coast, given no choice, and is still bewildered by his situation. To quote another film from a long time ago, 'Who are these guys?' Here Bourne just wants to live his life. He knows he's in the cross hairs but chooses to back off and try to live a normal life. They just won't let him. Once again, there is very nice acting and some wonderful scenes, chases, narrow escapes, etc. A very good action film with some mystery to it.",7,0,1,25 January 2008
The Great Gatsby," Maybe Someday!
","Maybe it's not possible to portray one of the greatest books ever written on the silver screen. This is at least the third time and I've been really disappointed all three. Neither DiCaprio or Redford (both of whom I really like) catch the true sense of the mysterious Gatsby. At least Redford was a bit detached. His failures of the past are in his head. DiCaprio (or the script he must follow) make him seem like a giddy love soaked schoolboy. He is so obsessed as to appear weak and maudlin. Another issue, however, is with the portrayal of Nick Carraway. Tobey Maguire is just too cute. I never pictured Nick as the little boy seen here (Sam Waterston, while not perfect, at least seemed like a possibility). Again, I like Maguire in other roles, but here he seems nothing more that Gatsby's toy. He's still physically lacking as a leading man. Mostly, it just lacked a bit of pizazz. Luhrman seems to think he can do it all visually, but this is a story of lost souls, trying to recover something they can't seem to reach. It fades and fades and in the end, it's hard to care much. Also, the portrayals of Daisy and Jordan just don't seem to draw us in.",6,2,2,3 January 2014
The Birds," It Just Could Have Been Better
","I don't know exactly why, but 'The Birds' sometimes leaves me a little cold. I admire the sense of threat, some of the signature scenes (the playground, the service station, Tippi Hedren going into the attic, the broken glass in the phone booth), but the pacing just seems slow. The pacing, however, seems slow. There is a lack of economy that I am used to in my favorite Hitchcock movies. Nevertheless, it is still a very good film. I love the premise it is based on. The DuMaurier story is more bleak and hopeless, the Hitchcock more open ended-still, the threat is there. My criticisms may seem petty, but spending less time on exposition may have made this a much tighter production. Also, I have nothing against romance, but the relationship between Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren takes up too much time from the issue at hand--THE BIRDS!!!!",9,1,3,7 May 1999
Sully," Somewhat Inaccurate but Captivating
","It's not easy to present recent history in film. The rescue of 155 souls in an airplane who were diverted to the Hudson River is still in our memories (I remember them standing on the wings). Tom Hanks does a cool, underplayed version of Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger, who will live in the annals of heroism for as long as we talk about heroes. I was wondering how one takes a two minute event and turns it into a bracing film. But they do. By including the events in the investigation of the landing, they are able to keep our attention. Sullenberger's actions came under tight scrutiny because the airline 'lost a plane.' As it turns out, the lead investigator for the NTSB wasn't played quite accurately. Of course, we are in need of a villain, and the geese that flew into the engines wouldn't make good witnesses. I'm used to filmmakers playing a bit fast and loose with events, but let's face it, everyday things don't draw much attention. Hanks is good. The pacing is good. The recreation of the landing is quite apt. A good film.",8,1,2,16 September 2016
Cinderella Man," Promotes the Human Element
","This is a story of a man, not just a boxer. We are never privy to all of the training and abuse Braddock must have been through. That's because we are as much a part of his family life and his dealings with the Depression as we are about the series of fights that he endured. He obviously was a great talent. The fact that he is held in such low esteem was a little surprising to me because he had not lost a fight. Granted, his injuries diminished his entertainment value and, as the film states, that's really what it was all about--tickets. But the real substance of the movie is Braddock and his family and the scenes where a man couldn't get work, even though he was able bodied and committed to the work. My parents told me that the word 'depression' was more than an economic term at that time. Hope was taken away. The character represented as Braddock managed to maintain hopefulness and even had to debase himself to keep his family together. He was like millions of men and women. You could only do so much to hold it together.This is a film strong in cinematography. The fight sequences are very good. I don't know how anyone can step into a ring, knowing that another man is trying to knock your head off. The punches are seen landing. The endurance necessary to keep going for fifteen rounds had to be phenomenal. But the scenes of the depression are also beautiful framed. Not just the sadness but the joys people still create. The group birthday party when all the kids celebrated their birthdays on the same day was something I wasn't aware of. See this movie. It has charm and pain and action. It never sells out.",9,3,4,21 April 2006
Jurassic Park," One of Those Moments
","There are a handful of movies that absolutely grab a person. The case I had on jury duty had been settled out of court and so I had an afternoon to see a movie. This is the one. I had anticipated it for so long and was ready for the disappointment that usually follows. It didn't happen. From the moment that Richard Attenborough says, 'Welcome to Jurassic Park,' I was hooked. And when the Brachiosaurs come lumbering across the grassy park, I was stunned. I know that since that time, computer generated special effects have become regular fair, but this was amazing. The other part of it, however, is that this a masterful story with a great deal of complexity (chaos theory, etc.). The people are interesting; the villain foolish and in over his head. Then there is wonderful set up of a park that is foolproof, suddenly losing its security. I don't normally like child actors, but the two in this express the terror that they indeed should. Some films hammer one with so many images; this one still relies on the greatest method of scaring people. It's not what you see; it's what you don't see. It's what's lurking in the bushes. The other thing is that the characters are on the playing field of their adversaries. Kowledgeable as they are, they are not in their own world. Those veloceraptors are a nice touch. As I was growing up, enamored with dinosaurs like most kids, I had never even heard of these creatures. Granted some of the threat is orchestrated, the scene in the kitchen is as frightening as anything I've ever seen",9,3,5,24 February 2006
Beetlejuice," Half Charming/Half Over the Top
","From 'Topper' to 'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir' to present day, we have had movies where ghosts occupy space with humans and even are in discourse with them (usually, only one of them). In this film, a couple of newlyweds purchase and old house and everything is fine until they are both killed in a car accident. In the afterlife, they continue to occupy the place, but, of course, the house is sold, and another couple moves in. This is disheartening as they now realize they are actually dead. We have a lot of potential here. They decide to drive the new owners out of the house, but they don't know what they can do, so they enlist an evil spirit, played by Michael Keaton, to do their dirty work. The problem is that he is totally uncontrollable and soon they are paying a bigger price than the new occupants. Of course, it's Tim Burton, so it's dark and oddly funny, but Keaton wears on one after a while, and the film slide into all sorts of gimmicky special effects. He is not the least likable, and that works against the charm of the story.",6,0,2,2 December 2016
Valkyrie," A Historical Film Must Fill in Some Spaces
","I can understand history buffs taking people who are critical to task. This is probably a pretty good representation of an historical event. I was captivated. It's a good looking film, with mountains and forests and paths to secret places. Where it breaks down for me, the casual movie goer and non-historian, is in the great number of characters, their loyalties, and their participation in this event. If you are marketing to a large audience, you must have a little softer touch. I suppose one could say, 'You're stupid! That's your tough luck.' I'll leave that to the documentaries. As for the flap over Tom Cruise, I had a hard time with him being a Nazi colonel. I can't explain it. He's got the glistening teeth and the boyish look, and, even with the missing parts, he doesn't work for me. I just didn't feel the emotional anguish I think a Stanley Kubrick would have brought out. The characters, mostly Nazi's, sort of blended into one lump, and when the movie ends, I'm not sure I've quite got it. Still, it is big and impressive and shoots high.",7,0,1,29 October 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Now, Go Back and Watch the Show
","Because I came to the show late because of a son who has been quite passionate, I never had the luxury of seeing it with any sort of consistency. I'm sixty years old and yet I take something away from nearly every episode I see. I don't know the names of all the characters, but the social commentary and the outrageousness is all I need. I listened to an interview with, I believe Matt Groening (though it could have been someone else). This man was asked if there would be a last show where everything would get wrapped up, like the controversial Sopranos. He said that there has never been a consistent plot line. Each episode stands on its own and, if there is a last one, it will be an episode like all the rest, that takes shots at our human failings and has Homer eating too much. I thought this movie was a joy. It pulls no punches. It shows us at our selfish worst but who cares? Tomorrow is another day and it will all work itself out (or we may all be destroyed in a nuclear disaster--whatever). If this movie is your first experience with the Simpsons, go back and see the show. The movie is very good, but it just continues in an hour and a half, what each half-hour does each week.",9,1,2,31 August 2007
All the President's Men," A Sojourn into Investigative Reporting
","The work of Redford and Hoffmann is impeccable here as are the supporting players. This, of course, is the story of the Washington Post investigation of the Watergate conspirators under the Nixon administration, specifically that of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein . It shows what happens when tips come in and the close scrutiny and support for sources that skilled journalists must adhere to. Because it was recent history, the players needed to be presented in a truly realistic way. We are introduced to Ben Bradlee, played by the wonderful Jason Robards, and all the principles involved. Hal Holbrook is the notorious 'Deepthroat.' There is a frantic pace to this as deadlines need to be met and the realities of the risks taken by the Post. Read a couple books on Watergate and then watch this. It is a gem.",10,2,2,30 November 2016
Draft Day," Fun to Be an Insider
","I remember when my Vikings decided not to pick Warren Sapp in the first round because they had concerns about some marijuana use at one time. They ended up getting some other sap who lasted one year. The former is Hall of Fame material. So when we get to see Kevin Costner, the general manager, wheel and deal on draft day, it's not so far fetched. What bothered me were that among the other general managers such weak kneed, fearful characters. Granted, they are under tremendous pressure, but they seemed pretty poor choices for this job. That said, it was really fun to watch the whole process unfold in a kind of docudrama way with the likes of Chris Berman and Mel Kiper around. The big show at Radio City Music Hall. The interaction between Costner and players he is interested in, the tradition in his family (he once fired his own father, but that's another issue) and the 'friendships' among the general managers trying to outfox one another make this fun. There is a sappy romance and a bunch of family pressure that I could have done without. The scene concerning the father's ashes on the day of the draft is idiotic. Things are also a bit contrived but aren't most movies? Costner is fairly convincing, butting heads with his head coach and the other members of the Cleveland Brown brain trust. It is suspenseful and worth watching.",8,2,3,24 September 2014
The Wizard of Oz," Love, Heart, and Courage
","It may be pointless to try to add to comments on one of those rare films that transcends virtually all others. I've been told that the audiences gasped when Dorothy walks out of the house and everything is in color. It is a transition to a magic place, made possible by cinematography. Growing up, we got one chance a year to see this. It became the highlight of an evening. It was usually on a Sunday night. The individual characterizations and incredible songs are the stuff that dreams are made of. I'm especially fond of Jack Haley's Tin Man. When he sings his song and then pounds his chest, finally releasing steam from his hat (a funnel) it's amazing. Those flying monkeys haunted me for years. Someone had a nightmare some time before dreaming those guys up. The amazing thing is that there is hardly a person who couldn't sit down and run through the plot of this. Some of my friends who grew up with kind of a harsh view of life, have no problem watching this. if you've been on Mars for the last 55 years, I hope one of your first tasks upon return to earth is to watch this movie.",10,3,4,9 March 2006
The Martian," Fun but Far From Great
","This is certainly an entertaining film as a formula movie. It's fun like the earlier 'Independence Day' film with Bill Pullman and Will Smith. We put a poor guy in an untenable situation, trapped on a planet when his colleagues are forced to take off and leave him behind. As a scientist, he does miraculous things to stay alive, including creating a greenhouse where he can grow potatoes (that just happen to be on board providing seed). That's OK. That's a plot element. He also has incredible knowledge of all the incredible stuff left behind on Mars. An amazing rover as well as a nuclear device. That's OK too because we can't have a plot without something for this guy to do. Where it falls down is in the reality of NASA (which we are told are a pack of insensitive boobs or nerds). They are going to do this and then they are going to do that. Jeff Daniels plays a stuck-in-the-mud guy who is only concerned about the politics of the job. I love Matt Damon. I've seen nearly everything he has done. He's adequate in this film but certainly not Academy Award material. He expresses almost no emotions other than a couple little under-control tantrums. What about the loneliness, the sameness of every day? Years of eating potatoes. Anyway, it is candy for those who don't want to think very much. It's very impresstive looking and the special effects are awesome. We've become a bit spoiled, I guess. Things by the formula.",7,9,14,14 January 2016
The Fighter," It's all about the good Fight!
","There's so much to say about this film. There is the amazingly dysfunctional family. Remember the harpies from Greek mythology. They probably bobbed and weaved like the sisters and the mom in this film. Talk about being sent into the world with two strikes. Then there is the relationship between the brothers. The acting, particularly by Christian Bale is first rate. He is so tightly wound and such a 'loser' in some ways, yet his heart is pure and he loves unconditionally. I was most impressed with the realistic interaction of the characters. The hopes and dreams that are stunted at every pass and yet there's always hope for a tomorrow. I wonder if this is the anthem of the punch drunk fighter. You've been hit so many times that you don't see the realities of you situation. The love interest is also nicely done. No easy relationships here. In this culture, the heart of gold is going to be tarnished if not impossible. This is gem of a boxing movie.",9,0,3,22 May 2012
Law Abiding Citizen," Way Too Many Contrivances
","Let's face it. Because a person is capable of pulling off the kinds of things done here, doesn't make the likelihood any greater. There is so much precision and luck involved in making things work that it would take a god pulling strings to allow these things to fall so easily into place. Even a silent partner is not going to do the job. I enjoyed the setup but the lengths gone through for revenge really pull it apart for me. The guy has so much power that he is completely in control. There would be a point in law enforcement where they would finally say, 'Screw you!' The technology would have taken a fortune beyond imagination to work out. While I like the actors in this film, I can't recommend it's far fetched totality. Done in a more controlled and believable way, you have a stunner. It's just too much. And the ending is a real weakness.",6,0,1,5 January 2011
Up in the Air," The World May Never Recover!
","I am a firm believe that technology is about to be the death of us and I mean in the not too distant future. We have released the monsters and they will consume us. I hope I'm wrong but it certainly looks like we have separated ourselves from the directly dealing with fundamental human issues. George Clooney's character is at least trying to keep a hand in the past; at least he faces the people he fires. Back at the office people are so excited about being able to cut throats from a distance and let the chips fall where they may. Of course, there is the obvious situation of their own jobs potentially being jerked from them without a by your leave. In 'The Box,' a recent film, people can become rich by killing off someone they don't know by pushing a button. Of course, most of the world doesn't know them. It's a dangerous game. The corporate world has become so incredibly warped and the machines we build that make our lives so much fun have put up walls like we wouldn't believe. I loved the movie because it still years for some humanity. Clooney is right, even though his work is cruel and dangerous. His return home is very effective and he finds his muse before it is too late, despite his own painful realizations.",9,0,3,20 April 2010
From Here to Eternity," Monty and Burt
","This is a bit of a soap opera prior to the events of Pearl Harbor. Burt Lancaster and Montgomery Clift are the stars here. The romance is intense as it will always be in a military setting. What we all know is coming is a morning in December when Japanese planes made their way to the Hawaiian Islands, setting things in motion for the U.S. to enter the second world war. The special effects as the stupefied residents see the planes overhead are gut wrenching. What I remember most the incredible distress and lack of a plan as the bombs are dropping. The isolationist mentality has some strengths, but it can also create a vulnerability that is devastating. One can have weapons to retaliate, but there'd better be a method to deliver them.",9,2,3,4 December 2016
Atonement," The Indiscretions of a Child
","We are such a fragile race, so affected by the shifts of a societal breeze. A child misinterprets what she sees and brings about the destruction of people she actually loves. So caught up in her dramatic wants and angry, she lies, and that lie haunts her for her remaining days. This is a movie version of a wonderful book, the best I read that year. It captures the pain and the need to make true restitution. The truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. The characters come to realize that. It's a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost. Probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life, but carries around her guilt to her dying day. She is never allowed to truly enjoy things. This is a really fine movie and, except for some breaks in editing, does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel.",9,1,1,23 November 2009
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Master Storytellers
","Those Coen brothers' movies really do grown on you. I had just seen Fargo when I rented this. It is one of the most creative, off the wall films I have ever seen. As these characters bumble their ways after a prison break, they are embraced by a series of the most unconventional personages ever to hit filmdom. And one gets turned into a frog--sort of. their flirtations with fame, the Klan, a cyclops, and all the other episodes, make this a hilarious romp. George Clooney's Ulysses is an obsessive, full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes, coupled with the charming half-wittedness of his fellow travelers, works at every level. Like Greek poetry, he is butting heads with the gods, but despite setbacks, keeps moving. It is story telling with charm and a load of bull. Everyone is some kind of philosopher, but the words come out of gap toothed, shaved headed hillbillies. And, of course, Clooney has hell to pay. I could watch this over and over again. And then there's the really cool music. I didn't even mention that!",9,1,1,24 February 2006
The Godfather," Film Perfection: Cinematic Mona Lisa
","So many have already said what this film has. It has an amazing set of actors. The cinematography is as good as it gets. It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of 'Deliverance' which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their 'labor'? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them. The unfortunate thing is that they push that hell onto their victims in the name of family.",10,1,4,16 February 2007
