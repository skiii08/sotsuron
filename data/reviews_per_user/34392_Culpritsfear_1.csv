The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Simply brilliant!
",I decided to watch this film more or less out of boredom. I have never really heard of it before and my expectations were accordingly not very high. I expected to see a typical high school romance drama or something in similar. I wasn't prepared to see the one of the best casted movies with a fascinating and twisting storyline I have seen in a long time. The story was not only very deep and emotional but also -and this is in my opinion super important- extremely believable and honest. The fact that Chbosky is both author and director of the movie and book results in a storyline very near to the one in the novel. The acting performances of the main actors are outstanding and make the characters pretty likable. The phases that Charlie goes through during his freshman year invite the viewer to relive one's own experiences during high school and help developing a sympathy for Charlie and his friends. Also the movie deals with problems like homosexuality and drugs without trying to judge. This movie is a special teen story with believable characters and storyline that you can watch more than once without a doubt.,Null,0,2,24 January 2015
