The Incredible Hulk," i had no idea this movie was a comedy
","i sit here in almost total awe of how many people thought this was a 'great' movie. did we see the same movie ??? seriously ??? i guess i'm in the minority who thought the 2003 movie was JUST FINE & the new movie was totally unnecessary. of course, Edward Norton was good, he always is. but Liv Tyler's terrible performance was laughable. she is one of the worst actresses ever to 'grace' the screen. she makes Kate Bosworth look like friggin' Meryl Streep. Jennifer Connelly in the 1st movie was practically perfect as Betty Ross. and don't even get me started on William Hurt. he had to have rec'd one giant paycheck for his wooden performance. heck, he was better in Lost in Space.",Null,4,8,14 June 2008
Black Snake Moan," how can you condemn a movie you've not seen ???
","This is in response to the comment posted by Gastoncarton1 who said the movie was 'utterly disgusting' but admitted they HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN IT: are you freakin' kidding me?!? how can you condemn a movie you've not even seen??? and you're judging the movie's merit by the poster ? seriously?!? you're probably the same kind of person who wants the Harry Potter books banned and you've never even read them. i'm sorry to actually have to say this to another human being, but YOU ARE A TOTAL IDIOT. how can you expect anyone to take what you say seriously when you are judging something and you have absolutely no idea what's its even about? and yes, i saw the movie and thought it was EXCELLENT.",10,8,16,3 March 2007
