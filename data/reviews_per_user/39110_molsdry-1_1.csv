National Treasure: Book of Secrets," 2nd half sleeper
",I have to admit that I enjoyed the first Treasure film and was expecting a lot of the same with the second.It did start off with a good premise with the secrets and hunting in the first half but after it seemed to resemble a serial of the 30's.I could pretty much know what was going to happen in the next 'cliff hanging sequence'.It seems everyone just phoned in their lines.No amount of rum and eggnog prepared me for this .All in all I was pretty much bored in the second half and could not wait for the film to end so I could go home and open my Christmas gifts. No sequel of the sequel please.Merry Christmas everyone.,3,8,17,25 December 2007
