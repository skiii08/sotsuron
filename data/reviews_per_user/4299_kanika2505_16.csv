Vertigo," Below expectations after Psycho!!
","I saw this movie knowing it's a Hitchcock's product. My first Hitchcock movie was Psycho and what a wonderful movie Psycho it is. I started watching Vertigo with similar expectations but I just couldn't feel there is any comparison. The initial portion though holds the flavor of a thriller but I guess the main feature that a thriller becomes more and more nail-biting as you approach the end, was missing. I felt the climax was pretty mundane and sort of incomplete and unjust for no reason. I'm still a Hitchcock's fan though and plan to watch all his movies, after all Psycho indeed was a masterpiece!!",6,1,5,18 September 2017
Constantine," Patience might be a handy tool for this movie!
","First half of this movie might push you to press the stop button. However, the second half picks the movie up to a level where you might think - 'Okay!! That's what they are talking about' or probably 'That's what they are trying to say'..The performances by all the actors is decent. The story however starts making sense only as it progresses.",6,1,1,6 April 2019
Deadpool 2," It's different.. It's entertaining.. It's a must watch!!
","Watch the movie for its best part and that is- '''''awesome comic dialogues, perfect timing and beautiful execution by Ryan Reynolds!!'''' Generally, Part 2 of a movie faces real challenge to live upto the expectations set by a superb Part 1. But, DP2 is one of the movies in that league where part 2 is equally awesome! Ryan Rocks.....",8,1,2,28 March 2019
Snatch," An over-rated movie..
","When I saw the ratings and reviews of the movie, I was really excited to watch it but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. Probably, high level of expectations took this movie down for me. The movie according to me was not very funny. I couldn't spot any good comic punches. To the most, I guess that the British accent was exploited a little too much. The quest for the stone, however was somewhat interesting. Overall, an average movie.",6,4,9,24 September 2018
Captain America: The First Avenger," Just an average Super-hero movie..
",The story doesn't grip you at all. There is not even a single action scene that is jaw-dropping. The comic punches are lazy and boring. The only thing that makes this movie still tolerable is the performance of its actors. Watch the movie only if you want to complete your count of all the movies in 'The Avenger Series'.,5,0,0,28 September 2019
Bird Box," A normal thriller.. Nothing much to expect
","It is a very normal thriller cum horror movie. The movie deserves enough credit that it will make you sit till the end, plus there are various moments that might give you little goose bumps but that's it. My personal overall experience after watching it till the end was just fine. I wouldn't have missed anything if I had not seen it.",5,1,2,1 February 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," One of the master pieces of our time!!!!
","It was the second time that I watched the trilogy that I was able to appreciate its real beauty that lies in the way the story has been written by imagining the world from an entirely different angle and weaving such an intelligent plot around it. The first time I saw it, all I was able to appreciate was the action sequence and the stylish phones. But the second time, the dialogues and the plot made so much sense and I really really enjoyed it this time at an altogether different level.I must admit, there still are things that I don't understand and for those I am definitely going to watch the trilogy again because it's totally worth it.......",8,5,7,11 April 2019
The Revenant," More or less an extreme version of Cast Away.... The plot isn't much though!!
",It is no doubt a wonderful movie for those who like how human body is so well adapted to survive in extreme conditions if you have a willingness to live. The plot isn't much but the picturization of the conditions in which the main character is shown to survive is really good!!It shows beautifully how nature can be so harsh but still gives you those little pieces to survive that can make enough difference to take you to other end of the line between life and death.,7,1,1,5 February 2019
No Country for Old Men," It's not just a 'One man running after another for money' story.. It's much more than that..
","The story is basically that of a man who is sad and heart-broken to see the increasing violence and declining humanity in mankind. It's about a feeling that most of the humans generally face at some point in their lives when they read or encounter unbelievable violence and ask a question in silence - What is a human turning into? The message is quite clear in the way it has been narrated..Other than this, for me, another big take away from the movie was - What a brilliant actor Javier Bardem is! He has been marvellous and absolutely exact in the portrayal of the character he was given.. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin were as usual superb but Javier as a marvellous actor was a beautiful discovery for me through this movie!!",8,1,1,9 July 2019
Toy Story," One of the best movies ever made!!!!
","Superb story, awesome dialogues, marvellous use of creativity and imagination in the creation of such an innovative world for toys. This movie has it all. I have watched it a few times and I can surely watch it again. A full entertainer!!!!",9,0,0,24 September 2018
Once Upon a Time in America," Two words - Beautiful Movie!!
","The movie as such has a very simple story of how the life is, for people who find their way of living in gang work. But, the picturization of this simple thing has been done in an incredibly beautiful manner. What comes out pretty clearly as the movie unfolds is, at the end of the day, what matters is the people you love and who love you. Somewhere down the line, people undervalue the treasure of love and friendship but in actuality when one is standing at the dusk of life, everything seems small in front of a true friend and the innocent and happy time spent together. Other than that, the actors have been marvellous. They are so effortless in their acts that it seems that you're witnessing the actual characters going through everything.. Robert De Niro was wonderful as the main character and all others, including all the child actors have done their respective roles in an absolutely natural tone..",8,3,7,15 May 2019
The Disaster Artist," James Franco is simply awesome.....
","The movie successfully portrays,1) the attachment that artists have for art and acting2) true friendship where the friends push each other to move forward and pull each other out from the pits of disappointment and no matter what, they stand by each other3) and last but definitely not the least- it is FRANCO AT HIS BEST......",6,0,0,5 February 2019
Jaws," Another of Spielberg's classics
","I saw this movie recently and though I've heard a lot about this movie before, today I watched it only because I saw that the director of the movie is Steven Spielberg and hence expected at least an above average experience. And after watching it, I can say that Mr Spielberg really has lived up to the expectations his name has built. A very nice movie of it's time, one of the classics and other than being a real entertainer taught me a thing or two about oceans.",7,1,1,15 July 2017
Kong: Skull Island," If building-sized monster(fights) is your thing, this is the movie to be!!!!
","AWESOME is the word that comes to my mind for this movie! I guess, when the main attraction of your movie is a giant scary animal, then this is what the movie should offer and this one is full of it; not just one but many. I can say that there were a few nail-biting moments for me and that definitely is sth that can make me watch this one again. The animation, visual effects, sound effects and action everything was superb! The story and dialogues were very average but i guess this movie wasn't supposed to ace these things actually. The acting front was decent, I wouldn't say extra-ordinary but again no complaints because it is full of SKYSCRAPER SIZED ANIMAL FIGHTS!!",8,3,4,5 September 2018
The Terminal," Light comedy cum feel-good movie..
","Few reasons to watch the movie-1) Tom Hanks
2) Steven Spielberg
3) Some light and cool DIY (not entirely practical!) survival (on the airport) tricks
4) Most of the emotions are in moderation - Lightly comic, lightly romantic, lightly villainy and lightly heart touching",7,0,0,30 May 2019
Deadpool," Successful amalgamation of action and comedy
","The movie I guess is one of the first of its kind with respect to a combination of 'superhero' action (Superhero-ish only because of the presence of Superhero powers as a result of genetic mutation and a Superhero suit) and comedy. No doubt, it was a risky experiment but quite clearly came out to be a successful one, all credit goes to the beautiful execution of the concept!!",7,0,2,31 July 2017
