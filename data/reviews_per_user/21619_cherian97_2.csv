Ford v Ferrari," Amazing movie! Definitely worth a watch.
","I was a bit skeptical about seeing the movie in the theatre but i booked the ticket and went for it. Good thing i did. I feel this is a movie that has to be experienced in the theatre. The racing scenes are AMAZING. The story is amazing. The acting is simply brilliant. If you are a racing fan, I expect you will enjoy this more than anyone and it is a must see. But whoever wants to cry, smile and feel adrenaline all packed into a movie, definitely go watch this!",10,3,4,3 December 2019
Joker," Amazing Movie. Brilliant!
","Once you leave the theatre, you will absolutely feel it was yi=our money's worth. This cannot be said to be just a movie. It has elements to it that can be seen in our society even today. How a person with mental illness is laughed by the society even if there is nothing he can do about it, and also about the divide between the poor and the rich. The directing was simply brilliant and captured the darkness of the mind of the joker, The stroy even if it may be at slow at first will get better as the movie goes on. The story is dark but at the same time has scenes with comedy in it. It also has shocking bits to it which makes it an absolutely brilliant movie. The Acting was also amazing. The movie absolutely lived up to its hype. Watch it if you can!",10,7,16,2 October 2019
