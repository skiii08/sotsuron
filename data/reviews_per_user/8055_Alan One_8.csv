Alien 3," Rich conceptual film lacking drama
","After viewing David Fincher's subsequent effort, Seven, this film gains a lot.  There's obviously a lot more going on conceptually in Alien3 than dramatically.  What interests me is how Alien3 (much like the other films in the series, especially the second and fourth) explores ideas of aggression, sexuality, and motherhood.There are obvious connections made between the first two in Aliens.  When Hicks offers Ripley a lesson in using a military weapon, the sexual overtones are heavy.  'Show me everything,' Ripley says suggestively. Their relationship never develops, as Hicks dies early in Alien3.  Ripley winds up seducing Clemens, the doctor for the monastic base on Fury.  Fincher suggests that the result of their contact is that Ripley is 'pregnant' with an alien.  Heavy stuff.There is plenty to work with here, but Fincher unnecessarily adds religion to the mix.  The base, formerly a prison colony, has evolved into a monastery of sorts, with Charles Dutton as the pugilistic leader Dillon. If Fincher was trying to equate the alien with some sort of demonic being, he failed completely.  Much of Dillon's religious exhortation seems woefully out of context.There is much to admire stylistically in Alien3.  The opening credits interpose snapshots of action that effectively construct a longer, more complete sequence of events.  The shots of the funeral for Hicks and Newt are intercut with shots of the new alien emerging explosively from a dog, as Dillon eulogizes how life emerges from death.  The juxtaposition is truly effective.Fincher's style doesn't lend itself well to extended action sequences, and the climactic attempt by the base inhabitants to trap the alien feels rather devoid of energy.  It's also hampered by the failings of his special effects; in most of the action scenes, the alien is an obvious add-in to the shot.  The ending however, is challenging, and a real departure from what one would expect from Hollywood (as it was in Seven).",7,0,3,14 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Just the plot holes, ma'am.
","You've probably already decided for yourself if this movie is racist, pointless, or true to the series, so I won't pursue those points.  Phantom Menace is a truly flawed film; what interests me are the failings of the plot.Lucas' moral construction in Star Wars was simple and clear.  The force is the medium of morality, and it has a light (good) and a dark (evil) side. In Phantom Menace, morality is somewhat less simple and significantly less clear.  The Jedi Council exists, from which the great forces of the light jedi descended, so it is assumed they are good.  When mention is made of the Sith, presumably the dark jedi, they are dismissed as not having existed for ages.  We, of course, know differently, but it is their perception that affects how the plot turns.  In this era of uncontested goodness, the Council's understanding of Anakin is certainly mysterious; they can 'sense' that he's 'dangerous,' but what would constitute danger if the Sith are gone, as they believe?  And their reaction to him is even more incomprehensible.  Instead of trying to steer him to the light side, they prefer leaving him alone; surely not the approach one would expect from the Council, which appears active in supporting galactic order.It also seems odd that Qui Gonn Jinn chooses to train Anakin, considering his belief that he will 'bring balance to the force' as legend has suggested.  If the Council is in power and the Sith are in retreat, surely 'balance' would equate strengthening evil (as we all know it will later in the series).Also, Lucas has abandoned the idea of constructing evil with plot elements and has resorted to the equation 'evil = evil-looking.'  Does anyone remember when Vader stormed onto the blockade runner and barked to his troops, 'Tear this ship apart!'?  Neither Maul nor Sidious do anything a tenth as evil (or interesting, for that matter).  Amidala tells us 'My people are dying!' but in the absence of any visceral proof, the tragedy feels rather pale and distant, as does the evil that causes it.The presence of C3PO and R2-D2, although refreshingly multi-dimensional compared to Jar Jar Binks, is an obvious attempt to procure audience sympathy.  Like most things in this movie, they are extraneous to the plot, and draw ovation due only to their familiarity.  Phantom Menace's most enjoyable moments were the glimpses of Sand People and Jawas at the pod race: a sad commentary on the film's ability to generate original emotion in its viewers.Finally, Phantom Menace represents the ultimate extension of a disturbing trend in 1990s cinema: filmmaking driven by special effects.  Much of this film is done because Lucas can do it, not because he should.  Few people would argue that Jar Jar Binks was worth creating, but let's broaden our scope a little; why does this film need Gungans at all?  It seems that the idea to have an entire race of computer-generated characters struck Lucas as neat some time ago, and he was determined to see it happen in Phantom Menace, regardless of its appropriateness to the plot.  Kenobi claims they have a symbiotic relationship with Amidala's people on Naboo, when obviously they don't.  Their presence is so forced, each appearance on screen is almost painful.Phantom Menace could have been a better film, and should have.",Null,0,1,21 October 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Great concepts, weak story
","Alien Resurrection supplies us with the logical extension of the conceptual issues raised in the previous three films; unfortunately, the story doesn't take us through them in a satisfactory way.Ripley's identity becomes more and more entwined with that of the alien throughout the series.  In Alien, it is little more than a lethal opponent; Aliens created a set of parallels between the two, primarily motherhood; In Alien3 the parallels become intersections, portraying Ripley 'pregnant' with an alien.  Now, Ripley and alien are reborn through cloning, a process that intermingles their genes, and conflates their identities even more. Ripley's blood is acidic, her physical traits are enhanced, and she communicates intuitively with the aliens.  The queen alien, for its part, gives birth to a human/alien hybrid, which identifies Ripley as its mother. These are all pleasing developments.  Also, Juenet's visuals are at least as striking as those of the previous films, crisp and stylish.  Both Brad Dourif and Dan Hedaya provide solidly enjoyable performances, in addition to Sigourney Weaver's serene Ripley.Instead of unfolding carefully and thoughtfully, however, the movie rockets into confusion in the first 20 minutes, and the rest of the film is a flacid series of chase scenes.  It chooses not to focus on the most interesting of the new characters (Dourif's alien-loving scientist, and Hedaya's General Perez), who are dispatched as soon as the aliens get loose.  Instead, we get to muck along with the foul-mouthed crew of smugglers as they work their way through the alien-infested ship, which, minus the shocks, is nothing less than boring.Alien Resurrection also reverses much of the work of Alien3, which attempted to return the alien to its status as a sort of supernatural death-figure. The components of the alien (which were so utterly horrific in the first film) are now gimmicks; one alien presses a button with its extendable jaws; in another scene, a 'chestburster' is used to kill one of the bad guys by placing his head right over the point of exit.  (This last scene is one of several that are sure to make this film remembered as the most gratuitously gory in the series.)There are several other moments worth mentioning (such as when Ripley discovers a lab that displays the results of failed attempts to clone her), but they are usually deflated by the lack of dramatic tact (in this case, one of the smugglers says snidely, 'Must be a chick thing,' after she destroys the lab in rage).  This was a film with enormous potential, only a fraction of which was lived up to.",5,0,0,12 November 1999
Aliens," James Cameron the way we like him
","If they ever do vote James Cameron 'King of the World,' it'll probably be for Aliens, not Titanic.  It seems the consensus about Cameron's writing ability is mixed at best (the influence of Titanic, no doubt), but Aliens, even after 13 years, seems fresh, well-paced, and utterly engaging the whole length of it.It's all the more remarkable considering that Cameron was working from Alien.  The plotlines flow smoothly into the new film, and several new themes are initiated and pursued, the most fruitful among them motherhood. We meet the alien 'mother,' and Ripley takes in Newt as if she were her child.  (The special edition also includes information about Ripley's real daughter.)  It's a line that will be explored more in the next two films; thankfully, Cameron avoided biting off more that he could chew.Aliens is also special for so successfully transforming a franchise from one genre (horror) to another (action), in the process setting new standards for action films.  Of course, the switch to action calls for certain concessions.  In order to present a war against aliens, Cameron makes them more corporeal and vulnerable.  In the original, the alien almost transcended physicality; as it dispatched some of its final victims, we see it moving slowly, arms outstretched, almost as if it were floating through water, confronting its victim face-to-face.  It was like death itself, inevitable, irresistable.  Cameron's aliens, though formidable, have just as much to fear from a bullet as any human.  The might of the alien is also lessened considerably with the change of location.  The nervous energy of Alien drew on the claustrophobia of a small crew on a single ship.  Aliens, located on a planet, noticeably lacks this.Still, Aliens represents a moment when all of James Cameron's strengths came together, a moment that hasn't been repeated since.",9,0,0,1 November 1999
Independence Day," Filmmaking driven by special effects and advertising
","After watching Independence Day, and the surge of adoration from American youth that followed, I wondered if the previous generation looked on with as much horror when the same happened for Star Wars.  I hope not.Where to begin on how awful this movie is?  The drama is propped up by dozens of unlikely situations.  We're supposed to cheer as the dog jumps through the door, narrowly missing an early death by fireball.  Would the fireball really stop at the door and preserve everyone inside?  Would their oxygen not be consumed?  Later, not only a stranded fighter pilot, but a horde of RVs stumble on Area 51, just in time for the president's arrival (whose wife has just been rescued by the fighter pilot's girlfriend).  This is the worst kind of stop-gap scriptwriting.The plot tries to make up for the gaping holes with extraneous material.  We are told with loving detail what the aliens look like, how their biologically-active protective suits work, of their telepathic abilities. How many aliens to we actually encounter face-to-face in the film?  You got it -- one.The attempt at generating tension in the first half hour is utterly ludicrous; every person on earth has seen the previews of the White House and various other buildings being blown to smithereens by the aliens. Before the opening credits role, we know a war's on.  Why pretend we don't?Independence Day was one of the first in a disturbing trend in cinema in the 1990s, culminating, I think, with The Phantom Menace: filmmaking driven by special effects.  The attitude of the film is, 'We do this because we can, not because we should.'  This inevitably leads the plot astray and dictates what course the aliens will take.  Wouldn't it be much more efficient for the technologically-advanced aliens to engineer a human-killing super virus? Sure, but then there wouldn't be great shots of L.A. getting vaporized.Equally offensive is the needless off-target moralizing of the film.  It suggests that the war is about 'independence' -- come on, guys, isn't really about survival?  The theme at the end is one of unity among the different nations, but it's a unity that consists of the U.S. telling the other guys when and where to shoot.  And if that's what unity is all about, then we've been getting along great for the last 50 years.",2,2,4,20 October 1999
The Green Mile," THE MOVIE THAT WOULD NOT BE EDITED!!!
","Could it be that The Green Mile is really three hours long?  It only feels like five or six.  But seriously, folks. . . I could take cheap shots all day at this film, but I won't.  There's plenty of more substantial things to dislike about it.In The Green Mile, the normal routines of a death row cell block in Depression-era Louisiana are upset when John Coffey, a gigantic, yet meek child-murder convict arrives, bringing supernatural healing and empathic abilities.  Coffey is a thinly-veiled religious figure (his initials are J.C., get it?), whose powers cause him to suffer on behalf of humanity. Paul Edgecomb, the morally-centered head guard of the block, is forced to consider issues of guilt, responsibility, and duty.When asked for a last request, Coffey expresses his desire to see a 'flicker movie,' something he has only heard about.  In the empty prison theater, he gets to see Fred Estaire and Ginger Rogers dance cheek-to-cheek in their 1935 film Top Hat.  (Interestingly, it was the same scenes that Mia Farrow gazed at longingly at the close of Purple Rose of Cairo to distract her from the train wreck of her life.)  To him, the dancers are 'angels,' and as he's strapped into the electric chair he intones, 'I'm in heaven. . . ,' the same line that Estaire sings.  The movies, director Frank Darabount suggests somewhat self-importantly, are a spiritual media that can transport us into an afterlife.In a film willing to shoulder the responsibility of a believable context, these ideas might bear fruit, but The Green Mile willfully avoids the complexities of its main topic, capital punishment.  Darabount, acting like the Oscar-crazed filmmaker his critics accuse him of being, uses almost every scene in a mad attempt to jerk at the audience's heartstrings.  Such a strategy leaves precious little room for the ambiguity that justifiably clings to the topic.  Darabount has no choice but to portray the convicts (and the other characters, for that matter) as either noble or evil.  With the exception of Coffey, we are not told what their crimes are; their only indication is the anonymous faces in the crowd observing the execution. These yawning gaps in context, in addition to the George Lucas morality, give the film something of the aura of a fairy tale, a distasteful precedent considering the importance of addressing the issues surrounding capital punishment with a firm grounding in reality.Did I mention that this movie is long?  Not only are we taken through every excruciating detail of each of the three executions, we also get to go through two dry runs.  In lieu of subtlety, Darabount figures the way to our hearts is redundancy.  Does anyone doubt it will work?",4,1,4,14 January 2000
Any Given Sunday," Probably win an MTV Music Award. . .
","1999 wasn't a great year for the big-name directors with well-established presences; Lucas, Scorcese, and Kubrick at best disappointed and at worst seemed irrelevant.  Oliver Stone fights the same fate like a gut-shot wolf snapping at his hunters.  In Any Given Sunday, he dishes out MTV in spades, but it somehow feels so. . . 90s.  A quick look at what David Fincher and David O. Russell served up in 1999 gives one the distinct impression that we're beyond all that.  The new aesthetic may still involve clicking, but now it's with a mouse and a web browser, not a remote control.  Also, the cut-and-paste music video style has been superceded (in the arena of sports, at least) by the omniscience of Sega or Sony gaming systems.  Sure, Stone's whiz-bang style provides several hits of adrenaline, but it's all gland and no brain.  The technology is there to explore every nuance of a play; why not take us through it like Scorcese took us through each cog and wheel of a casino?  Instead, there's a lot of huffing about who gets to call the plays, the coach or the QB.  Haven't we seen this before?Which is all very far from saying that there is nothing to like about Any Given Sunday. Jamie Foxx took me in as the struggling third-string quarterback Beamen and Jim Brown's jaded assistant coach was quietly impressive.  Both of them hold their own against the familiar, blustery Al Pacino as head coach D'Amato.  Unlike many of Stone's critics, I can't slip easily into a tirade about his obsession with father figures, but I do wish Any Given Sunday had focused more on Beamen and his world instead of D'Amato and his machinations, just as I wish Nixon had been a film about any one of the thousands of Cambodians whose lives were destroyed instead of the man who destroyed them.  Still, there are enough moments of brightness here to bring me back for his next film.",5,0,0,10 January 2000
The Matrix," Subverting a media monster
","What message to draw from a film packed with pseudo-religious metaphors? It's clear to me that the Wachowski brothers are, at least on one level, calling for subversion of the media-industrial complex of which they now find themselves a celebrated component.Their film extrapolates our current state of media suffusion to an unsettling conclusion, in which humans from birth are hooked into a sort of a massively-multiplayer RPG, one so convincingly real that they don't realize it isn't the only reality. The matrix is presided over by an evil robotic intelligence, which uses the oblivious human participants as a biological energy source. The first step in fighting back is to 'wake up' and enter the real world, where free humans stage attacks against the matrix and its minions.In our own increasingly mediated world, the brothers tell us, our consciousness is dominated by corporate media environments, which nourish themselves by enmeshing our lives with theirs - whether it be through Phantom Menace merchandizing, or 'synergy', or hopeless schmucks posting movie reviews to IMDb. The media provide our lives with meaning, but deaden us to pain, and separate us from reality. Agent Smith, when explaining to Morpheus that a past matrix, which had depicted an idyllic world, was rejected by its human hosts, sounds suspiciously like a studio executive explaining why his movies are excessively violent - because it's what the people want.How do you subvert a media monster? Taking lessons from the music industry, you can either go Frank Zappa (and be unlistenable) or Rage Against the Machine (and rock). Neo goes the Rage route, popping up with bigger guns and badder kung fu. And The Matrix does the same thing. It tries to subvert the predominance of the action film by out-doing it with a whole new class of bells and whistles. (As a friend of mine used to say, 'You have to get behind the man to stab him in the back.') Will it work? Not a chance. More likely we'll all be drooling over the idea of a sequel.",Null,0,0,3 January 2000
