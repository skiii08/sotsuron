The Lobster," Film Liquet on The Lobster
","Made by the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, there is no wonder that 'The Lobster' makes you feel completely uncomfortable and uneasy, showing off the director's script writing techniques and unique style. The plot centres around a dystopian future, where single people are placed in a hotel and given 45 days to find a romantic partner or otherwise they will be turned into animals. Starring Colin Farrell as a newly single man trying to find a partner in order to remain human, after failing to do so, he decides to flee and become a loner - who the people in the hotel hunt, which extends their stay in the hotel.With an absurd fictional storyline, the film delivers an interesting premise, criticizing the ridiculousness of forcing someone to fall in love due to common interests, or forcing someone to get married, being a common practice. Commenting on the social pressure that is put on the adults, along with the notion of putting people into boxing, not allowing bi-s well as not allowing shoes that are between sizes.I am not a fan of the director's works; however, I try to remain unbiased when judging the work. The content along with the plot of the movie throws a lot of people off because of the ridiculous concepts, however it is in that ridicule that the director exposes the real life flaws of different cultures and social activities, such as critiques of marriage. The film is shot with a lot of thought put into it, the shots are well framed and show off the breath-taking locations of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Collin Farrell and Rachel Weisz, along with the other cast members add to the film greatly.",7,1,3,7 November 2018
The Death of Stalin," Film Liquet on The Death of Stalin
","With the sudden death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, the communist party of USSR struggles, as they try to choose a new leader. The film is a more satirical version of what happened in the few days following the said tragic event.Having seen the film, it seems more to me like an over the top historical drama, which has been well made and adapted for the big screen. It educates the audience on the events of the power struggle in Russia, showing some of the might and tyranny of Stalin, highlighting awful events that occurred at the time, whilst also taking the mick out of the situation, but showing how ridiculous the well-known comedians portray that event. Although some consider it to be more of a dark comedy, we found it quite amusing, as the character development of Steve Buscemi as the next ruler of the communist party is shown to be a ridiculous event, whilst the killings of innocent people continue.Regarding my professional opinion, the film was quite well shot and managed to portray the colder colours of the USSR using different light and shadow techniques, as well as colour grading. What I found very amusing was the fact that the set designers left the lights in the scene deliberately, in order to light the shots and serve as old projectors in the late 50s. Overall, the editing pace might have been slow in some places or others, however the film worked and kept my attention throughout.",8,0,0,7 November 2018
Se7en," Film Liquet on Se7en
","Two homicide detectives (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) are investigating the case of a serial killer, as one of them is about to retire (Morgan Freeman), whilst the other has just transferred to the precinct and is only starting out (Brad Pitt). This neo-noir, set in the gritty, grey-looking New York, begins with the character of Brad Pitt entering a crime scene to introduce himself to his new partner, Morgan Freeman, however their first interaction proves to be quite cold, as the 'old dog' does not warm up to the newbie. Furthermore, they are assigned a mysterious homicide case, in which the killings are linked to the Seven Deadly sins.
The film starts off with a series of Fincheresque shots, establishing the morning routine of the detective, then transitioning into a unique introduction title sequence of the film, which focuses our attention on minor details of the shots. It throws us into the action, the music straight away portrays the films as a tense crime thriller, in which the murder scenes send shivers down your spine and make you tense up, expecting a jump scare after every musical build up, keeping the viewer on edge during all times, grabbing our attention and not letting go throughout.
However, even though Fincher's masterpiece retains the status of a must-watch, the film is more of a stylistic piece, showing off the director's way of seeing things, it might have been better with more content and ironically 'suffers from the sin of self-consciousness' (Malcolm D.; The Guardian, Seven, 04/01/1996). By my opinion it is also one of Morgan Freeman's best performances in a film.",8,0,0,21 November 2018
Lost in Translation," Film Liquet on Lost in Translation
","An American movie star (Bill Murray) and a young, married college graduate (Scarlett Johansson) are both stuck in Japan, not knowing a word of Japanese, they seem to be lost in translation, as the title suggests; however, it seems that they are out of place with both Japanese people and foreigners. One day, not able to sleep they encounter each other in the hotel and their friendship begins. The film portrays an experience that most people can relate to, the feeling of not belonging and being lost (whether in life or abroad). Edited with a lot of jump cuts and focusing on making the viewing experience seem alienating, Coppola based much of the story on her experiences in Japan.Aesthetically, the film shows many different sides of Japanese culture, showing both the youth filled night streets lit by neon, and the hard working adult environments during the day. The shots are well done, some intentionally done handheld to relate to the characters and some completely still to focus on them or their actions. The film was shot in an improvised, almost documentary style manner and the Director of Photography (Lance Acord) minimised the usage of artificial lights, not using the conventional Hollywood way of shooting, in order to maximise the realistic setting. This way it feels simple and alive, allowing you to see yourself in the characters and feel them.There are no subtitles present, to put the audience in the same conditions as the protagonists of the film, absolutely lost and without an idea of what to do. Nonetheless, the film is an absolute pleasure to watch and it makes you think and question your life and your purpose in it.",7,0,0,7 November 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Film Liquet on Bohemian Rhapsody
","Bohemian Rhapsody, the name speaks for itself. You already know about what and who it'll be. The film is not a documentary, it is a tribute to Queen and their music, an entertaining story of one of the world's most iconic bands, featuring set of events leading to a legendary Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium in London and it does its job perfectly.Despite the fact, that the film looks like a yet another generic music band movie, it can completely stand on its own because it is a Queen band movie. Being made under original cast members(Brian May and Roger Taylor) supervision it shows us a glimpse of their relationship in the group and with Freddie himself, being portrayed by Rami Malek. He is one of the main reasons why the movie works, he is the perfect cast for the role. Even Brian May pointed out that the cast for everybody in the movie couldn't be more perfect. An outstanding performance by Rami portrayed not only an extraordinary persona Freddie showed on stage, but also showed how much alive and vulnerable he was in real life.The cast, the performance, the costumes, the music, it has all of it. There is nothing more a Queen fan can ask for. Even if you are not fan, you will still enjoy the film and feel all the energy put into it. Dealing with life issues and struggling with showing the world who you really are was a big part of Freddies life and when the film shows it, you really start believing that if he made it, you can do it too.",8,1,3,7 November 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Film Liquet on Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
","We all know about Peter Parker. He saved the city, fell in love and then saved the city again and again. But this is not just about him, not anymore. Miles Morales(Shameik Moore), a teenager who admires Spider-Man, struggles to adjust to his new elite boarding school and live up to the expectations of his parents. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes the one and only Spider-Man, at least in his reality. In the result of Wilson Fisk's particle accelerator, multiverse brings his counterparts from other dimensions into his reality and they have to work together to stop an immense threat.The first thing, that has to be acknowledged is the unique animation style, which combines comic-book visuals and fantastic animation, it works perfectly in this movie and it is more precise than a live-action movie, even though it does take some time to get used to. The pace of the film doesn't feel rushed, it takes its' time. Character arcs and their backgrounds are well written and develop the characters well throughout the movie.If you are new to this character and only know who Spider-Man is, you can still enjoy this movie and everything will be told in most dynamic and humorous way possible. It has everything a great Spider-movie should have and even music is great and feels like it belongs to the character.

Drive," Film Liquet on Drive
","Driver. A Hollywood stuntman by day and a getaway driver by night (Ryan Gosling). He Does not show emotion, he remains calm and cold at most times; however, he can still feel and help out people in need, like his neighbour (Carey Mulligan), whose husband is in jail. After coming out of jail, the husband is indebted to the mob, so he takes on a job in order to pay his debts, enlisting the driver to help him out. The job fails and now the Driver must risk his life in order to protect the neighbour and her son.Vicious violence, drama, emotional characters and a messed up character ark. This movie has it all. The film elements are perfectly balanced between not showing enough and showing too much, and at 95 minutes of running time it is neither too short nor too long. It hooks the audience right from the very start as our mysterious protagonist explains his work rules, to the very end, as he drives off into the night, making the audience crave more, leaving everything open to interpretation.Beautifully styled, shot and edited, Drive has many miniscule details that the audience will only pick up on with their subconscious. Tiny digital zooms, minor set and shot details, which add so much more to the meaning. The little references to earlier films and intricate plot details leave us wanting to see more, even though the character's end in the perfect position.",8,1,1,7 November 2018
Schindler's List," Film Liquet on Schindler's List
","Let me start off by saying that Schindler's List is a very heavy film to watch. It is not meant for everyone and not every member of the audience will able to appreciate it. The gut-wrenching, horrifying scenes that represent the real events happening during the Second World War in Krakow, Poland, are hard to watch. The film being three hours long, tests your patience and ability to put up with the inhumane events on screen.
The film is about a businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), who arrives in Krakow in 1930, ready to make his fortune from the new World War. After joining the Nazi party for political immunity, he re-opens an old factory, using Jewish workers, as they are cheaper than any other person at the time. When the SS begins exterminating Jewish people in the ghetto, Schindler tries to save his workers, in order to protect the operation of his factory and what starts as a selfish reason becomes a noble cause to save innocent lives.
The film is in black and white, however the opening sequence for some reason is in colour. The film's events are very realistically shown, up to the point where it becomes infuriating and sickening to watch the tragedy unfold. The human emotion portrayed by the actors is too believable, it physically brings you to the place of the events and shows us the horror that the Jewish people experienced during the horrific events. This is the sole focus of the film.",9,2,5,25 November 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," Film Liquet on 2001: A Space Odyssey
","Starting with the Dawn of time, the history of mankind is portrayed as it evolves, encountering a mysterious black monolith in both, the pre-evolution humanity stages and the futuristic world of 2001. A timeless classic, the Space Odyssey is argued to be one of Kubrick's finest works, as it features one of the most well-known Match cuts in the history of cinema and was determined to be the 'ultimate science fiction movie', as Kubrick said.Even after 50 years from the release, people are still talking about it and asking the same questions that still haven't been answered.In addition to an interesting plot, the movie was known to adapt groundbreaking camera techniques that would later inspire new filmmakers all around the world, seeing as Kubrick intended to break the set norms.Even though we speak of it as the timeless cinema classic, the Space Odyssey for many is quite hard to watch. It features long scenes devoid of action, to which the modern audience is not used. We have adapted the idea that films must always show us things and tell us what is going on, thus breaking the basic rule of filmmaking - show, don't tell. In doing so, the modern audiences have been desensitised and are not used to the film making us think. The Space Odyssey is still a brilliant film. First following a mysterious astronaut mission in deep space, it then comes to a tense showdown, paralleling Homer's Odyssey and even after the conflict is resolved the film takes the audience further than anticipated, giving each member of the audience to interpret the film differently.",9,4,8,7 November 2018
Pulp Fiction," Film Liquet on Pulp Fiction
","Pulp Fiction follows a non-linear narrative structure, meaning it is told out of chronological order. It follows three interlaced stories of multiple characters. One follows the story of Vince Vega (John Travolta), as he and his friend Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) arrive at an apartment in order to retrieve a briefcase that belongs to their boss. They murder one of the guys that stole it and then Jules recites an Ezekiel passage from the bible before executing the other one, as they double-crossed their boss. This is where the iconic lines are said by Samuel L. Jackson - 'I dare you mother*cker, I double dare you'.Being a Tarantino classic, this film blew up back at the date of its release, because of how violent and real it seemed. The characters are very believable and the brilliance of the film is smug. Everyone's destiny in the film plays out, either coming to a halt or ending in a further story. The non-linear structure, divided into different stories, makes it seem like you are reading a book, which switches character perspectives in order to tell you more, but at the same time leave you wanting more information. The situations in the film are absurd, unique, inventive even, the same can be said for the dialogue, as the audience is left guessing, not knowing what anyone will say at any moment, seeing how wild and alive it is. The characters never sound the same.Showing the life of the 90's throughout its' characters, the film does not leave you bored, trying to entertain you with aforementioned situations, as Tarantinos' writing is meant to and knocking you off your feet, as the absurd takes its turn, another timeless classic shows us how films are supposed to be made.",8,1,2,7 November 2018
Murder on the Orient Express," Film Liquet on Murder on the Orient Express
","The world's greatest detective's (Kenneth Branagh) trip through Europe comes to a halt when a murder mystery unfolds aboard the train. Covered by an avalanche, the train passengers are all stuck in the train with the killer, as the detective races against time to solve the crime before the killer strikes again.Not far from the other three screen adaptations, the 2017 remake of the Murder on the orient express does not present the film with an active question, solving the mystery for the viewer it lacks engagement and therefore is made as a passive audience film. Even though it does not stimulate the viewer to ask active question after, the film does indeed succeed at telling a murder mystery plot. Sweeping us off our feet, as any deduction made by us along with the detective is then dismissed and started anew.With good set design and good cinematography, the film tries to capture the aesthetic of the 1930s, however fails to do so, as the visual effects, used to recreate Istanbul, do not stand up to the expectations of a large budget feature film. Although the design of the set is everything imagined upon hearing the words elegant and beautiful.",6,0,3,7 November 2018
Arrival," Film Liquet on Arrival
","After the appearance of 12 extraterrestrial spacecrafts around Earth, the US armed forces recruit linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner), in order to research the written language of the aliens. Further on, Louise starts seeing visions of past or future, which one? She does not know and has yet to find out and use it to solve the mystery.Having a linear structure, the film sometimes decides to move in time, providing interesting effects for the audience to experience, such as minor confusions and peaks of interest throughout, as the language of the aliens becomes more and more interesting to the linguist, the audience is also tempted to find out the answers to many mysterious signs that are not translated into human language. However this kind of storytelling leaves a lot of unanswered questions.With several turning moments in the films, the whole film becomes a philosophical argument of the concept of time, making it so the viewers aren't left without a point to think about. The film broke the main principle by not showing, but telling us the needed information in order to move the plot forward. Although it is better for the audience to experience it firsthand along with the main characters.",7,0,1,7 November 2018
The Shawshank Redemption," Film Liquet on The Shawshank Redemption
","Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is no doubt a film we have all heard about at some point in our life from family relatives or close friends. Having heard about Morgan Freeman's stunning performance, I would even go as far as saying it might be his best performance in a feature film. The film focuses on Morgan Freeman's retelling of a story about a bond of two imprisoned men, finding hope when they could not believe into anything anymore.The film is set in prison and therefore anyone watching should be prepared for some harsh scenes and animalistic behaviour that is expected from the 'clichÃ©' prison inmates. The film tries to accomplish a unique feat, humanising the inmates and trying to make it out to the audience that everyone is human and always has a part of humanity in them. It shows it by breaking the characters will and leaving them in despair, only grasping for the last glimmer of hope that helps them survive in the disturbing prison situations.Morgan Freeman's performance plays a substantial part in the whole film, surely presenting itself as one of his best narrated works, however it is the interaction between him and Tim Robbins that really stands out, the contrast between them is what makes the movie interesting to watch, which lead to me not pausing once during the whole movie. Despite showing us the world full of unfairness, cruelty and greed, it delivers a powerful message of kindness and hope, making you want to change something in your life after watching the film.

Trainspotting," Film Liquet on Trainspotting
","-'Choose life'
The film is about making choices, choosing everything you want. Danny Boyle, the director, shows heroin as an alternative lifestyle, that the characters chose. They chose their life, the needle and they don't regret it. The film does not glorify drugs in any way, most of the viewers will find many scenes disturbing, dirty and not pleasant at all. It won't be easy to watch, but it's not meant to shock, the scenes make perfect sense in context of the story, showing life of day to day heroin addicts.Without any certain plot development and chaotic storytelling, the film still takes you along the rollercoaster ride of Edinburghs aesthetics and terrifying truth of drug addiction with the help of Mark Rentons narration and portrayal of that times youth. The decision to become clean and get rid of the addiction was not an easy one for Renton, but how much your surroundings, so-called friends(basically, the only thing in common between them was heroin) can affect you sometimes and get back on the path you just rejected.The structure of the film makes a circular plot. In the beginning Renton denies choosing life, being a normal person, he chooses not to choose, he chooses heroin. Events of the film change him, make him realise he's growing older, more mature, that his friends are not really friends and can betray you at any moment, and he chooses to choose life.",7,1,2,7 November 2018
Amélie," Film Liquet on Amelie
","Amelie focuses on the young woman Amelie and her story as she tries to influence the lives of people around her by making them even a little bit better or worse. The film is narrated throughout and has a very warm feeling to it, not only because of the orange colour tint, but also because of its heartwarming mood.The film has its' own unique style. It becomes a rare piece of art in the eyes of the audience, as so much is put into it. The story is uniquely complex, but at the same time it is completely simplistic and gives the viewers immense pleasure in the little encounters that we can all relate to. It has various themes that are meant for adults as they are relatable, as are the characters in the film.Shot in over 80 locations in Paris, the film shows the romantic city atmosphere and the busy life of its' residents. It is well shot, well-structured and most importantly - it keeps you interested until the very end, telling you about how beautiful life is.",8,1,2,13 November 2018
Heat," Film Liquet on Heat
","McCauley (De Niro) is a mastermind criminal, who plans heists around the Los Angeles area, whilst being tracked down by Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) - a homicide detective in the Los Angeles Police Department. Whilst Vincent is occupied with his job, he is also dealing with his wife cheating on him and his daughter's poor mental health.Based on a real story of a Chicago detective tracking down an ex-Alcatraz inmate, the story retains many elements that make it more believable and real for the audience, grabbing our attention from the very beginning to the end. Although there were moments where the film went on for a bit too long, considering its' 170 minute run time, as the ending began to unravel, the tension and the drama kept me glued to the screen until the very end.The Dialogue is complex enough to allow the characters to say what they're thinking, in the well-known diner scene with De Niro and Al Pacino, they just talk about their situation how it is, and they both understand that only one of them is going to survive until the very end. The characters are not trapped within clichÃ©s and the dialogue proves that, showing us that unlike the real world, they are able to tell another person exactly what they feel.",8,1,2,7 November 2018
Moon," Film Liquet on Moon
","A man works at a lunar mining base for a period of almost three years, fulfilling the terms of the contract that he was sent there with. During his last week he experiences a minor accident which leads him to find a clone if himself, leading to a major confusion.Moon being made in 2009, has a stunning array of visual effects and has quite a strong plot, even though it revolves mainly around a single actor. The Moon and the lunar base are designed very well, making the film very believable. The balance of white and black is one of the most prominent features in the film, they add the sense of danger and safety, as well as shooting the literal dark side of the moon.The plot of the movie is well, the twists aren't too predictable and bode well in the overall structure of this text. The open ending is a good way to finish off the movie, leading us to believe that the clone survived and reached earth, which brings hope into this rather lonely movie.",7,0,0,23 December 2018
The Godfather," Film Liquet on The Godfather
","This criminal drama focuses on a powerful Italian-American mafia family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). After his daughter's wedding he refuses to make a deal with a new drug lord in the area, which leads to him getting shot by a rival family, who is now in a deal with the said drug lord. Following these events, the youngest son of the family (Al Pacino), leaves his civilian status and joins the Mafia, becoming involved in the ever-going family business, made of violence and betrayal.Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, the lighting and cinematography are the first things that you notice throughout the film. The use of light and shadows, combined with precise framing makes this film unique, almost like Francis Coppola adopted a different style for this particular film. The menacing sound track makes sure to put the viewers on edge, seemingly making the protagonists even more menacing and scary in the eyes of the audience, as the mafia should be like. Being one of the best performances of Al Pacino, the aesthetic of the film only adds to the dark world of mafia orientated New York.The film itself is a good illustration of the post-war America in 1945 to 1955, so if you like me, are a sucker for post war America, you'll be pleased by the film's look at the very least.Follow us on instagram!
