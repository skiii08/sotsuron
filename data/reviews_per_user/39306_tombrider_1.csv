Requiem for a Dream," great!
","it's one of the best movies i have ever seen. it is so fantastic... i love it, i think that most of the people who have tried drugs will love it for sure, it is so revealing!!!we don't need to infect our lives with such a thing like drugs! We do not have to be related with drugs, so people think about it, and drop it. my friend was depended from drugs 3 years, and we did know what to do, but now he is clear and he says that we feels like a real human, so i am sure that everybody has to say for drugs no. my friends was depended from drugs until he got into terrible accident. he was driving a car and suddenly he fall asleep, he hurt two people, thanks god they are OK today and he cut his ear! now he almost can't hear with one ear. So Be free, do not use drugs!",10,3,6,4 November 2006
