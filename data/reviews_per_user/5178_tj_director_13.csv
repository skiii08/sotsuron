3:10 to Yuma," What a film! Absolutely Brilliant.. and no one saw it!!!
","I used to dislike westerns something rotten, i couldn't take them seriously, that was until i watched the dollars trilogy, and saw what westerns were really about.. a recent time in history where money was truly king, and life was worth as much as it cost to live another day, and whether that was historically accurate or not, it didn't matter, it offered the opportunity to show men at their basest and most basic. 3:10 to Yuma captures that essence, and it is the driving force behind the story, a story that is great pulp fiction at its best. It's hard to find fault with this film from a story-telling aspect, I'd find it hard for someone to get bored, or to not want to know what happens next, and to find themselves completely satisfied by the time the end credits roll.When you watch Yuma you wonder why it wasn't as well known, it has a great cast, with faultless performances, Crowe and Bale have an amazing chemistry, and the supporting cast is fantastic, Ben Foster is fast becoming the best guy on camera that you love to hate.. wow i never expected him to play the roles he has since first seeing him in 'Get Over It', but now he plain flat out rocks, i'll watch anything with him in it and it was a pleasant surprise to see him here. But why did no-one see this film?? THE NAME!!! the promotion campaign had some of the coolest posters going around, but who is going to watch a film with a bunch of numbers and an odd sounding abstract name in it? It sounded like a science fiction film, but was a western. Once you watch the film you'd find it hard to call it anything else, but this film is a pure example of the title defeating its success.I hope the name doesn't hurt it post theatrical success, because this is seriously a great film that anyone who enjoys good stories will like, right up to the immensely satisfying finale, this is one of the best films of 2007 by far.. if you're even half interested in watching this film , and are reading IMDb reviews to figure out whether it will be worth your time and money to watch it.. just stop reading now and go watch it!!! i'd be highly surprised if you were disappointed.. not many films make it into the IMDb Top 250 within a few months of being released, and the ones that do.. they're usually worth 2hrs of anyone's time.",10,2,5,28 January 2008
Fight Club," Fincher.
","After watching 'Fight Club' my mind was made up that David Fincher is definately one of the best directors around, but I can only use that term lightly, as I've only seen this and Se7en, Alien 3 doesn't count as i was too young when I saw it, he also did an Aerosmith video and anything concerning them scores in my book. Anyway, I watched this film in a cinema at an empty matinee, but I really wished I had watched it with friends because it's one of those films that deserves to be talked about afterwards, many people will be intrigued(?) by the ideas in he film, I wasn't as I already had that way of thinking, but this film will open many people's minds. I can't put all the kudos on Fincher, because as with every film it's the writer that makes it, and I read the excellent script (spec and shooting) by Jim Uhls. (it's based on a book by C.Palanuik) and it's good to see that the film hasn't changed a great deal from the paper.The start of the film is a really, really good credit sequence, the soundtrack is excellent, and it got me really pumped up, and i expected more adrenaline moments like this later, but they never came, and that's my personal fault with that 1st sequence. Anyway had I read that the film is very good 1st half, but got stupid 2nd, so I just sat there expecting to take things with a pinch of salt, but I never felt dissapointed, and I never got bored like I thought I would. This film kept me interested the whole time, which is unusual for me in films without a point A to B storyline, like the 'will he get the treasure type' story. What I like about the directing, and this is what I like about Fincher and his style - he's Fresh, he isn't a Follow-the-Leader type, he does things in slightly different way, the credits going the opposite way in Se7en sum him all up for me. Fight Club also stays visually interesing throughout, and the imagery has stayed in my head since I watched it months ago. I'm just dissapointed it didn't get any major award nominations, It's really a film that deserves the praise, American Beauty got nominated with it's dark and sexual representation of American Suburbia, which is something the Acadamy stays away from, so why couldn't Fight Club have one, I personally found that Fight Club had a more positive message than AB (PS I don't hate A.Beauty) Fight Club's the kind of film i'd take an under-17 to watch, as it has something to say, and could teach some people a thing or two.
I know a lot of people who thought that Fight Club was a film just about fighting, I knew before watching it wasn't and I hope that's not what it'll be remembered for, and it should be a film that is remembered. Fincher has 2 modern-day clasics under his belt, and that takes some doing.",9,0,1,28 February 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," i'll keep this short. [SPOILER FREE]
","look i love movies, i watch tons of films, i even someday hope to be in some way responsible for making films.. i'd like to think i know a good film from a bad film. I've seen LOTR 6 times within a month of it coming out... and don't think that's common for me... i've NEVER watched a film so many times and within such a short space of time! I rarely watch a film more than once by myself!!!  I've read the books as well as 'The Hobbit' etc.. so i would call myself a mini-fan, and i simply can't fault the adaptation, and i feel sorry for those who do... because they're missing the picture.  It's a film that deserves as much praise as can be given... and for those who disagree, i really do feel sorry, because if you could experience even half of why i love this film and Tolkein's world so much, then you'd feel that feeling of contentment only a man made piece of fiction can do to you.
This is one of those films that will go down in cinema history!!!150% praise to Peter Jackson, New Line and all the other hard working souls who made this film possible... but curses to them for making us wait too long for the next two films!!!! :D",10,0,0,17 February 2002
28 Weeks Later," Better than first, Best horror/thriller in some time.. Excellent!
","it's only been a couple of hours since watching, and i'm sure i'll come up with a few plot holes over time, like why he did this? could that have really happened? etc.. but that's not important because there was only one moment i felt distracted like that during the film, and even then it was explained soon after.. but i haven't been on the edge of my seat for an entire film for a very long time.. 24 being the only thing in recent memory to get my adrenaline pumping.The sense of dread in this film is amazing, the action is perfectly timed and paced, it is just one of those films where the audience literally gasps a sigh of relief when the credits start to roll. If you thought the first film had a good premise, but felt lacking in some way, particularly thrills, then you will love this film. My friend made a good comparison, 28 Weeks Later as a sequel is similar to Aliens.. in Alien it was a small group of people, the enemy was new.. in both sequels, the enemy is known, and the guns are loaded, yet it still manages to make you feel like there is no escape. Alien was an example in tension, Aliens was an example of the emotions felt on a roller-coaster ride. The same applies to the 28 films.Ps. they took full advantage of and made London look amazing, its probably one of the best films to sell the city, even if it is full of crazy zombies!!",9,1,4,23 May 2007
Spirited Away," I rarely feel like watching a movie again straight after.
","I either post a review when i loathe a film, or feel a film has been unfairly dissed.. but in this case it's because i completely adored it.
I think Miyazaki is a genius, i really do, people compare the story to Wizard Of Oz or Alice In Wonderland, and they are very similar in content, a fantastic new world, and a young girl who must learn more about herself and others to leave, and just like those 2 stories this one if FULL of imagination, every single minute is filled with something new and fresh, borrowing from Japanese mythology as well as Miyazaki's previous creations (i.e. the adorable soot creatures), it ranges from the surreal to the sublime. The story can be written on a post it note, yet my biggest flaw with the film is that is a good half hour too short! i simply didn't want the film to stop.. but i suppose that was the whole point of being spirited away... I think there are people who might find things a bit too wierd and tripped out, but they can't deny the overall message of the film, it isn't some huge life changing event that the hype makes it feel to be, it is just one of the most amazing films ever made, there is a beautiful subtlely to it all.. it doesn't have some mad epic grandouise adventure plot, there are no mega set pieces, no songs or big numbers, the film is mostly set in one building, there are times when you don't know where the story is going, or if there is any.. but this is a common feeling in Miyazaki films, they aren't about getting those pre-set highs or step by step film structure.. they are more about escaping to another world and being a part of it.. which is in my mind the greatest single thing a film or book can do... and this film achieves it, by the end you will be moved, maybe not to streaming tears, but you will feel something.. this film will mean something to everyone! a genuine masterpiece :)",10,3,5,14 August 2003
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Excellent Film & Prequel
","Like many others, when I first saw the title of the film, I thought 'great, another cash in'.. then I saw the trailer, and thought to myself 'actually, this doesn't look half bad'. Now that I've seen it I almost wish it didn't have the 'Planet of The Apes' moniker because it is an excellent standalone film and a brilliant example of a summer blockbuster that will appeal to all, but pander to none.This was an excellent counteract to my experience of 'Cowboys & Aliens', which i watched last night.. a film I was really looking forward to, considering the concept and the talent involved, but it was the most cliché ridden piece of lazy film-making I'd seen in some time. I've been in a mood all day, then I went to Planet of The Apes, expecting more selling out.. but what I got was a fresh and original film. There wasn't a single off moment to me in the whole film, If I have any issue, it's that we're barely given a chance to breathe, the pace is relentless. Amazing use of the camera, whether it be real or virtual, and speaking of, WETA have triumphed yet again, and produced some truly outstanding special effects.. in my mind this was one of the best and effective overall uses of CGI.. you genuinely believe these are apes that are becoming intelligent, you really do care more for them than the humans, and that's a real feat. Okay some may say 'well Franco isn't exactly the most dynamic fleshed out character'.., but this isn't meant to be The English Patient, I honestly think you could have put these apes into 'The Shawshank Redemption', and they still would have stole the show. Either way, best visual effects of the year in my opinion, it really won't be long until we create a completely believable human being... unless of course the Apes take over.. I honestly left the film feeling 'I want to be an ape god damn it!'.. I wonder if we'll be able to watch the original films in the same way after this. Hope there's a sequel that shows their true rise to power, but as it stands this is an awesome prequel, and a brilliant film.",Null,1,6,6 August 2011
Amadeus," yeah everyone thinks it's a classic but..
","now most classics, i can very well agree with their status, but this one i just can't understand why it's so acclaimed.. critics love bringing down any historical film down to it's artistic licences, but i'm amazed at how this one is so over-missed.. now come on Mozart speaking in an American accent, and most of the cast using contemporary dialogue.. i don't care how great the subject matter or production design is.. but really i can't overlook that fact.. A Knight's Tale having a moment where they sing Queen's 'We Will Rock You' i can enjoy, that film isn't taking itself entirely serious.. but Amadeus is!!! and there cast using american accents and contemporary dialogue in film set in Europe hundereds of years ago, is one of the biggest plot points i could think of.. i just couldn't take the film seriously, and it was pretty boring.i'm not some ignorant movie goer either.. in fact i know a hell of a lot, so don't think i'm some 14yr old movie buff wannabe.. This film is seriously over-rated. Milos Forman has made many a great film (Cukoo's Nest, Larry Flynt, Man On The Moon [all set in the 20th Century i might add!]), but this in my mind was one of his absolute worst.. it's as if he was lazy enough to just leave the boom mike in shot the whole time, and leave in sounds of the crew working behind camera. .it's just that ignorant a film.   It has enough fans (and oscars), that i don't think my blasting of it is going to hurt it one bit, but if you're REALLY serious about films, (and i don't just mean someone who watches a lot of films, but someone who thinks about films every other second of the day) don't go into this movie thinking it's the absolute masterpiece everyone makes it out out to be, it just isn't... the accents and dialogue totally overshadow what could have been a truly great film! because everything else is top notch.. but i can't forgive such easy and obvious mistakes in such a high profile film!!!",2,11,45,26 February 2003
Grave of the Fireflies," NOT for the kids!!
","For some reason animation can move me more than any feature film, real life people acting, are just that, and you know that deep down, no matter how good they are, but succesful animation will really have you believe you are in another world, and for 90 minutes these people are real, and their emotions can be expressed within one single brushstroke. Good Animation is life exagerated and condensed into one great art form. And a film like Grave Of The Fireflies, is one example of animation doing what film could never ever do. Sure the scenes could easily have been shot as live action, this isn't Akira. In fact as a feature film, it would cost next to nothing to make, but it just wouldn't have the ability to even come close to capturing the dream-like beauty and utter emotion of it..Next to Monster's Inc this is probably the only animated feature in recent years to really move me to tears, though while i could watch Monster's Inc again and again, and with no moral concern with a bunch of kids, i could not watch Grave Of The Fireflies again so easily, and definately not with a youngster. It has humour, but there is a very dark and real-life message, and it's told so simply that any child will get it, and it will depress the hell out of them. I'm 21, and during the whole second half and the few hours before going to sleep i was just numb, no other film has EVER done that to me, and i've seen my fair share of movies!In fact i've seen mostly all the war greats, but this for me has to be by far the most effective anti-war film i've ever seen. If you're an adult, i would recommend watching this film with my highest praise. (PS- make sure you don't watched a dubbed english version, it sounds like a saturday morning cartoon! ) IMDB compares the film to Empire Of The Sun, and the setting and themes are pretty similar, that film as a kid had my eyes open and aware of the peril of war, but that film is Disney compared to this.. Parents you have been warned!!And definately make sure you watch it in the right mood. It will be one of the most beautiful, depressing and moving 90 minutes you'll ever spend sitting down in front of a screen.",10,0,1,6 January 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," I need to see it again...
","A movie as hyped, could only warrant the slightest of negativity, especially from someone who appreciated the hype.. but the only negatives i can come up within 2 days after seeing the film, are dominantly related to the crowd i watched the film with... yet the reactions of those not in tune, are probably the best reactions.. in years to come those people who saw this film and laughed at the inopportune moments are probably the same people who found Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction highly controversial on first viewing... and its those people and their realisation that the controversy was unfounded who are the people who make films like these live on past their domestic theatrical shelf life.Some find Jackie Brown weak... but compared to a lot of other films, its very strong, the film-maker's previous films had so much notoriety that they couldn't be topped within the same measure, and QT got an unfair bad rap for it, though anyone watching it now past the hype will be able to fully appreciate the fact even after only 4 films Tarantino has proved he can't make a bad film.And Kill Bill is like the cherry on top... hardly a moment passes in the film when you don't feel this is different, yet familiar, its Tarantino, but its something new from him, ok not a great deal to achieve after a handful of films, but they are such iconic films.This is only Part 1, just like LOTR you can't fully conclude your comments on it, but just like said film(s) what you can say is this is a film who has someone behind the camera who isn't just some director for hire, but someone who knows how to make movies that stay with us...Kill Bill V1 is a classic in the making... you may have noticed i didn't actually comment on any of the specifics of the film, but that's because its like a concept album, you just need to watch it, let it soak in and appreciate the complete picture.. just like any classic film.
to even dare comment on Vol2, would be completely moronic.. it may be the worst film ever, who knows? just let us glaze in the glory that is Vol1 for now... even the dream of Vol2 satisfies me more than many other films.PS: Kill Bill requires an understanding of Japanese/Eastern cinema... and if you liked KILL BILL, but know nothing of that side of cinema, i could do nothin better than recommend you discover it. Tarantino has made the perfect homage, in that its as good if not better than its influences!!!
Utterly Excellent!!! :D",Null,0,0,18 October 2003
There's Something About Mary," One of my Favourites.
","for me this film has all a comedy needs, the cast is full of my favourites - Ben Stiller - Cameron Diaz (damn she's fine) et al. I just have to look at Matt Dillon with the teeth and a smile comes to my face, and Lee Evans as the so-called Architect is perfect. This is the film i've rented the most, I really should have brought it by now. The scructure of the film is real good as well, the jokes work real well no matter how many times i watch it. This is definately probably my best comedy.",Null,0,0,30 January 2000
Life Is Beautiful," I won't watch it again, why???? (spoilers)
","I knew this film was critically acclaimed, but would it have been had the 2nd half not taken place? The first half is funny stuff, and you could just imagine R.Begnini sitting there writing it laughing, then something happens, like he didn't get the toy he wanted in his happy meal, so he changes everything. I know it wasn't like that.I tend not to write a review in IMDB unless I like the film, because who am I to say a film is rubbish, a film will always be liked and hated, no film can please or upset everyone, but I think this is one film that will do a lot to appeal to a lot of people. People looking for laughs will laugh, even the 2nd part is funny, and people looking for a love story will find one, the romance isn't fake like many films, where Miss.x plays love interest not Miss.X. And the film will move people who want to be moved.I felt sad at the end when he dies, but I didn't cry, and I'm bit of a girl, I cry easily. But the last line really hit me hard 'And that's the sacrifice my father made for me', I'm only 18, but this film will really give parents particulary Fathers a big lump in their throat. This is a film that makes me more sad when I think about it, than when I actually watched it.The scene when he is walking in the fog, he comes across something, which o me didn't seem clear on VHS, but the next day I figured it must have been a pile of bodies, and this is what made me feel bad, Even though he'd seen all that misery he kept sane for his son. Had the whole film been like the first half, I could watch it again but...This is a film everyone should see.",Null,0,1,28 February 2000
The Green Mile," the book and the film are one.
","If you read the book ,and you liked it- then there is absolutely NO reason why you wouldn't enjoy the film. Of course certain story beats have been altered for time and commercialism, but I wish they hadn't, the film may already be long enough, but I wish the film could have been copied scene for scene from the book.I had just finished the book a few hours before I watched the movie, and to see the actors perform what I just read was amazing. Darabont and the actors did the book just I had it in my head.The 3hrs passed by so quick, maybe for others things could be slow, but I myself didn't feel that way. People brag about how books are better than films, but while a book can bring you to tears, it won't have the power of film, and when a book is adapted as well as THE GREEN MILE, then you can consider the film and the book to be one.",Null,0,0,16 May 2000
The Iron Giant," Now one of my favourites.
","I rent movies, i rent A LOT OF MOVIES, i rent them within a week of coming out, but sometimes due to various reasons, the odd movie gets missed - but i will eventually rent it some time later.The Iron Giant was one. On DVD Animation looks great, i love the style of animation in The Iron Giant, but with any film after an hour no matter how visually stunning, or how good the sound is - you'll have got used to it, now the story has to be good enough to keep your interest.I'll keep this short, and say The Iron Giant is in my Top 10 films of all time, and that's saying something. WARNING: Do not avoid this film....",8,0,1,29 November 2000
