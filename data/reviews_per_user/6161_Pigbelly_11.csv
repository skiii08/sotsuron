Ghost," Just plain awful...
","Ghost is a hold over from the atrocious movie making style of 1980's Hollywood which would not take a chance on serious film after the high budget 'Heaven's Gate' flopped in the early 80's. (Hollywood in the 80's were marked by a series of teen films and crappy semi-serious films that were so maudlin they seem comic in retrospect). Ghost is one of these just plain awful films. Bad acting, bad writing and terrible 'special effects'. It is a sappy piece of trash that was popular with people who see one or two films a year. Whoopi Goldberg overacts horribly and the whole premise is ridiculous. Good riddance to the bad Hollywood film making of the 1980's!",1,12,32,15 August 2004
Unbreakable," Unbearable
","Sitting through this tripe was a painful experience. The childish, simplistic and frankly idiotic attempt at creating duality between a 'breakable' man and an 'unbreakable' one makes me want to puke. Honestly, my puke would have more interesting to watch than this puerile nonsense. Comic books do not translate well into movies and this is a prime example of why directors should stop trying. I have rarely been so conscious that I was in a movie theater watching a really bad film other than maybe squirming through the awful Sin City (another comic book conversion disaster). When my friends and I left the theater after seeing Unbreakable, we were all speechless until a good friend (and fellow critic) turned to me and uttered 'unbearable'. This is the perfect catchphrase for this smelly turd of a film. Unbearable.",1,8,13,24 January 2006
Romeo + Juliet," 10 reasons to poke yourself in the eye with a stick
",Here are 10 reasons why it would be better to poke yourself in the eye with a stick rather than watch Baz 'I make sh*t for the eyes' Luhrmann's travesty 'Romeo and Juliet'1) It is less painful 2) You will feel better about yourself afterward3) It takes less time4) You will be more cultured5) You will lose less brain cells6) You will still have one eye to see some real Shakespeare7) Your friends wont laugh at you as much8) You will have a nice pointy stick to beat the crap out of Baz Luhrmann the next time you see the little moron9) You will have a nice pointy stick to poke yourself in the other eye instead of watching Baz Luhrmann's next piece of crap10)You could poke out Baz Luhrmann's eyes instead and save the world from all his MTV tripe and be a HERO!,2,1,3,15 January 2007
Cast Away," Stinks like a guy who hasn't bathed in 4 years
","Zemeckis is the purveyor of some pretty stinky cheese. This movie wasn't as bad as Forrest Gump (there ahould be a 0 for films like this) but it's close. While Forrest Gump is a testament to how ridiculous the Academy Awards are, Castaway is a monolith marking the turning point where feature films become just a vehicle for product placement. Like the Daniel Defoe novel it was based on (the first novel in the English language) it is a homage to capitalism. The Puritan ideals of Robinson Crusoe, where man's worth in the world is determined by his wealth, is modernized in Castaway and gives us a glimpse of the worthlessness of American values and the films made there. This movie is horrible. The values it expresses are horrible but thank Satan it is not another Forrest Gump. A solid 1 out of 10.",1,5,22,12 January 2005
Armageddon," The Biggest Waste of Talent in Movie History
","This movie stunned me. I sat watching it like a slack-jawed idiot, mouth agape, eyes transfixed on this colossal train wreck of a film. It must be the biggest waste of talent in the history of filmaking. The cast (other than Ben Affleck and Michael Clarke Duncan) are decent. Even Bruce Willis can be good once in a while (Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys). But, this whole movie is just a big formulaic, predictable, melodramatic turd. How can a movie that was this expensive to make with a massive special effects budget and all these talented actors be SO utterly boring and just plain bad? It is so very, very BAD. It must be the Michael Bay touch. He has to be the worst American director of his generation. He is to America what Uwe Boll is to Retardland or wherever the hell he comes from. I've got a great idea! An action-horror film directed by Bay and Boll! It would star Steven Seagal and Sandra Bullock with Whoopi Goldberg as the comedic relief! It would be based on Grand Theft Auto and Donkey Kong where two hard-nosed cops have to fight off a mutant gorilla that attacks Florida!",2,10,21,16 March 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Unbelievably bad
","Where to start with this crap. It's trying to be like the original and Texas Chainsaw Massacre mixed into one huge melodramatic hunk of celluloid crapola. The Hills Have Eyes is geared for a teen audience and never lets you forget it. It's laughably bad. The acting is just a smidge above House of 1000 Corpses and the directing is possibly worse (if that's possible). The cinematography (hardee-har-har) is like an MTV music video of the lowest quality and just as irritating (jump cuts and illogical angles and edits). The characters are just stupid (both enemies and heroes) and I was just hoping everyone would drink poison and die together in the first five minutes and end the pain. I've seen more entertaining pre-school plays. I love good horror films but this is just an absolute lowest common denominator money grab. If you liked this film, congratulations on not finishing grade 8 and good luck with that service industry career.",2,1,3,19 January 2009
Moulin Rouge!," Crap with a capital C
","I have the distinct feeling Baz Luhrmann would like to direct MTV videos. The quick cuts and glossy look of this film reminds me of a Spice Girl's video and has about as much of a story. This film is such an ode to MTV culture that I would call it 'irritating to the eyes'. The ultra-quick MTV cuts and the pointless focus on eroticism trivialize any attempt at a plot. Moulin Rouge is the 'Best Little Whorehouse in Texas' set in France with the addition of an extremely irritating cinematic style. Baz Luhrmann began his career with melodramatic schlock (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo and Juliet) and has now out done himself. The popularity of this film is understandable as the average movie goer and music buyer indulges in what is heavily promoted but the discerning viewer should realize what an irritating piece of celluloid crap this movie is. A solid 2 out of 10.",1,2,6,9 January 2005
The Green Mile," A movie is only as good what you put into it
","First of all, this movie fails like most Stephen King conversions to the big screen. Stephen King is a horrible writer, one of the worst of the 20th Century. His base characterizations are like poorly sketched comic book characters. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors supporting Tom Hanks (Sam Rockwell and Harry Dean Stanton to name two). Tom Hanks has a great money making face but his acting is pretty bland and sub-standard in most movies. The writing, however, is just stupid as most King ventures. Grown men get scared and pee their pants and the ironies that he is able to present are so obvious they are like being hit in the face with a building (very BIG black man is a sweet and harmless innocent). This movie was like going to an fine Italian restaurant and ordering a nice Farfalle with Creme Sauce and getting cockroaches in white paint. Yuk. 2 out of 10.",2,9,27,19 January 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A mediocre film for the masses
","This movie only makes the top 250 because the average movie goer was wowed by the nice digital effects and the nice (if somewhat boring) cinematography. However, this movie had no story just as so many critics have stated about Tolkien's trilogy (please check the reception history of Tolkien's novels if you don't believe me-- I teach English). Tolkien was a mediocre writer at best and this trilogy translates into a mediocre bore-fest. I have never seen more effort put into such a boring story. Tolkien's 3 tomes could have been summed up in about five paragraphs but it seems that Peter Jackson is just as long winded as JRR. These three films have about enough story material to make an interesting short film. Jorge Luis Borges would have been horrified to see such a travesty of pointless, long-winded storytelling.",4,9,22,10 January 2005
Sin City," A Film for a Generation of Utter Morons
","This film was so bad I actually was yelling at the movie screen. All the while, the underage teenage lobotomy cases that had snuck in 'ooooed and awwwwwed' at this 'masterpiece'. I can't believe there is anyone above the age of 12 who liked this piece of crap. It seems there is a new generation of movie-goers who have had their last brain cells popped by too many millisecond jump cuts used in the latest music videos and were wowed in their youth by the gawdy colours of the Teletubbies that they have been conditioned to respond positively to this kind of cinema. If someone says to me they liked Sin City I immediately think 'aha your brain must be made out of sh*t pudding!' and never listen to anything they have to say again. Sin City is likely the worst film I have seen in 5 years. To see it in the top 100 is laughable... the world is full of utter morons and apparently they have all seen Sin City.",1,10,23,4 June 2006
V for Vendetta," An Idiotic Melodrama for Teens, Half-Wits and Teen Half-Wits
","Movies keep getting more idiotic and the audiences just get more brain dead by watching them. Anyone over the age of 15 who gave this movie a good review probably still lives with their parents, eats peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for lunch and is still a virgin. This movie is asinine, juvenile and just plain derivative. There are so many films this movie has copied that are SO much better it is almost pointless to watch it. The teenage melodrama that exudes from this stinker is like 'The Crow' with bigger acne pimples. If you think this is a 'good' film try watching 'Brazil', the director's cut of 'Blade Runner' or even '1984' (not great but a masterpiece when compared to this crap). This is not as bad as 'Sin City' (my vote for the worst film of 2005) but it has so much sucky teen angst that it will make you want to buy a slurpee and ride a BMX. My verdict: V for Vendetta is total crap with a script that seems to have been written by a grade 9 student with an inferiority complex. Avoid this film if you are older than 15 and you have an IQ above 75.",3,4,10,8 July 2006
