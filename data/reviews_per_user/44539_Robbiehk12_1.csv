Men in Black 3," They're back.. In time
","They're back.. In time, that's the tag-line that's been stuck in fans of the sci-fi franchise Men in black for the agonising months leading to the belated instalment (10 years in fact) In the successful series. But the question that remains is, is it a hit or miss. As a fan of the first and quite disappointing 2nd films I had my expectations.All my worries were put to rest on Friday night when I went to the local cinema. From the moment I seen the Columbia pictures logo and heard the main theme I had shivers down my back, The film opens with the explosive prison break of Borris the animal (Jermain Clemment) which sets the stage for the rest of the best film I've seen in years. All in all this Sci-Fi comedy is a hit with the emotional Final√© that will leave fans a little teary. The special effects are superb and the alien designs from Rick Baker are Top noch.Barry Sonnenfeld,Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith have really outdone Themselves and one thing I say is bring on number 4",9,2,8,28 May 2012
