Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A waste of time, resources and Rufus Sewell
","A mindnumbingly insulting concept and terminally boring execution. A snoozefest. How they managed that with the gorgeous Rufus Sewell, I don't know (obviously, they made poor use of him). The folks who thought this was a good flick apparently don't care how dumb the script or the concept get as long as they get their action scenes. At least I didn't waste money on this at the theater -- but I did have to sit through it when it played on HBO and I lost control of the remote. AAAAAGH! I felt like I was losing IQ points just having it on.Sewell is the only guy in this film who put a decent amount of effort into his acting, and he was sadly wasted here (I hope they paid him a bundle for this, because he sure can't put it into his portfolio of hits). In revenge and to clear my mental palate, I made my TV companion watch Dangerous Beauty with me the moment this abortion ended (Beauty is not only a much better film, but Sewell got a much better role).If I could give this loser a ZERO, I would, because it deserves that. Don't bother with this unless you really prefer being mindless (and in that case, don't brag about it).",1,3,5,2 October 2013
Trouble with the Curve," A role Eastwood should've tackled 20 years ago, not now
","Caught this one tonight on HBO. I'm usually appreciative of Eastwood's efforts, so I kept waiting for this to improve ... but it didn't. I might've liked it more if Clint hadn't looked more like Amy Adams's grandfather instead of her father and Justin Timberlake hadn't looked at least 10 years too young for her. I had real trouble believing the men in their respective roles.Adams was fine, though; I'm usually not a fan of hers (she's been way too perky for my taste in too many roles), but she hit just the right note in this role, highly believable as a woman holding her own at work and in the world, fending off asshats who resent competent women in the office and in her private life. Hard to believe, but I watched the rest of the film after the first 20 minutes for her, not for Clintwood. Who'd have thunk it? Otherwise, baseball fans would probably dig it, but it wasn't my cup of tea. Take a pass.",5,2,4,1 June 2013
Clash of the Titans," Unspeakably bad
","Usually in a mediocre sword and sandals outing, there are one or two elements that are bad enough to damn a film. Here, there's not one element that could salvage it. The sets are tacky and cheap. The dialogue is puerile, weak and stupid when not actually outright insulting to the viewer. The acting is wooden enough to give splinters. The script doesn't have enough for many of the main characters to do and completely wastes the rest of the cast. The writers deserve a firing squad: if you're going to deviate *this* much from actual mythology, it's forgivable only if you produce a better piece of art because of it. That didn't happen. Here, ***NOTHING*** works and the story is butchered to no purpose other than clueless impulse and ego. And the director deserves never to work again in film in this lifetime or any other, not even as a janitor.If Sam Worthington really wanted to make a worthy version of this film for his kids' generation, he should have read that script much more carefully before agreeing to be in the film. This one is memorable only for its sheer awfulness. ZERO points to everyone concerned -- a complete waste of time and money. Give them all a kick in the shins and be done with it. UGH!!!",1,4,6,11 January 2011
