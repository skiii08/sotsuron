Lucky Number Slevin," An absolutely incredible film.
","When I checked the ratings, I couldn't believe 'Lucky Number Slevin' only got a 7.4. This one was of the best movies I've seen in a long long time, and definitely one of the best scripts written in the past five years. With amazing plot twists and enthralling performances by Hartnett, Kingsley, Freeman, Liu, and Willis, I would definitely recommend this well thought out and incredibly put together film to anyone.The beginning of the film is slightly confusing, but comes together at the end incredibly. I must say, I didn't see the end coming whatsoever. The violence was absolutely perfect- not over dramatic, and every bit of it was necessary with the perfect amount of gore.Monologues from Kigsley and Freeman spice up the dialog, and Hartnett plays a very good, witty, smart-ass character. I couldn't have picked anyone better for any of the roles. Definitely see this one.",9,10,26,21 April 2006
Silent Hill," A little creepy, a little corny, but a good crossover.
","I saw this movie last night after I read some reviews, and my expectations were high. Well, the movie starts out kind of corny. The dialog seems a little clumsy, and I don't know why everyone is hyping the actors because most of them delivered their lines a little cheesily.To give the movie credit, the special effects were pretty incredible, but sometimes the CG blood looked pretty fake. Characters from the game popped up now and then (i.e. pyramid head) and were pretty scary, and they definitely got the zombie/freaks exactly right, and they were pretty scary as well.Overall, the plot was a little lacking, especially toward the end. It was a great concept, just not as well executed as it could have been. I didn't really feel that I cared about the characters, with the only exception being Sean Bean.This isn't really the type of movie that would make me pee my pants, but it was better than anything else 'scary' out there right now. It brought the feel of the game put together with a good new story, and I would recommend it to anyone who's played the Silent Hill games, or anyone who's got an open mind about odd/far fetched films.",6,1,4,22 April 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," A nasty trip, although not so scary.
","I'm not into horror movies as much as others, but I can (and do) appreciate a good horror flick from time to time. 'The Hills Have Eyes,' however was not a 'good horror flick.' This movie is one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen, and I felt like the producers were really relying on the 'oh, sick' feeling to pull the rest of the movie out of its mediocrity. The character development wasn't so bad, and I found myself cheering for the 'hero' at the end, but my main gripe with this movie was the conclusion. It was so lame, everyone in the theater kind of went, 'Awww.' There were certain scenes in this film which really stood out to me, for good or for bad. For example, there's a scene where the camera pans out, and you get to see all of the nuclear blast sites from an aerial view, and it's pretty impressive. However, scenes such as the 'bonfire' scene, with its cheesiness and obvious animatronics, should have been re-shot.All in all, this movie was worth seeing once, if only for the gore, but I probably would rather have rented it for 3.00 instead of paying 7.50 to see it in a theater.",5,0,1,21 April 2006
