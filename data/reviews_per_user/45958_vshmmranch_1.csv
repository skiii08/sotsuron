3:10 to Yuma," An Excellent Choice
",This is one of the best remakes of an old western that I have ever seen...well worth your time and money to go see this one on the big screen. 3:10 To Yuma has always been a favorite movie of mine and my husband ( we are both Glenn Ford fans. Russell Crowe is always an excellent choice as he is one of my favorite actors but he has a supporting cast that does a phenomenal job even though he was the bad guy in the movie. I went with my sister on a Saturday afternoon and we both enjoyed it although westerns are not her usual choice of movies. This is one of those movies that will be in my DVD library when it is released...but please; watch it on a big screen first for the full effect of all the action.,10,5,10,22 September 2007
