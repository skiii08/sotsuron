Hereditary," Scary is places..
","The Hereditary movies scares dont come from the film itself, it seeps within the atmosphere of the movie.. Most of the movie was very unsettling, however much to my despair it failed to frighten me... basically just made me feel uneasy...Acting was superb Reason it didn't reach higher review That ending could possible be one of the worst.. but don't let that put you off
