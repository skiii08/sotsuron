Skyfall," Bond has finally died.
","WARNING: Contains SpoilersThis is like someone dying at a wedding while letting out a huge wet fart right after the priest says: 'You may kiss the bride'.It is just an awful movie. The beginning was okay, albeit too long but then I almost fell asleep for the rest of the movie. We are given no reason to care for any of the characters except one that gets killed of while bond does nothing to stop it.The main villain gets killed by bond with a knife between the shoulder- blades which I suspect is a clever way of saying; 'Look, he got stabbed in the back again, just like that one time with the Chinese.'If you really like Bond movies or movies in general do not watch this. It is an absolute waste of your time. It is boring, full of plot holes, weak characters and poor pacing and storytelling.",5,12,22,17 February 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Stay away.
",Not everyone was one hundred percent happy with the film adaptation of The Lord of The Rings. But I feel certain when I say that every Tolkien fan did not believe it could get as bad as this. I loved the books and liked the films but this is a travesty.Even if this was just some random movie about a dragon it would still be a huge mess of a movie. We have a supposedly intelligent and powerful dragon that laid waste to both a human city and a dwarven kingdom. But suddenly he goes all Scooby doo villain on us and can't even maim a single dwarf. Rather he spends 20 minutes stupidly smashing into stuff like a fat dog on a slippery floor.Another thing that plagues this filth is that it can't decide if it is trying to be a kids movie with stupid fat dwarfs bouncing around like basketballs or if it's trying to be a edgy movie about angsty elves decapitating and stabbing orcs in the god damn neck. Then the movie ends with a soft pop music song with slight influence from the movie.This mixes like oil and water. Do not waste your time.,1,12,17,30 April 2014
