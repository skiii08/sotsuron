Deja Vu," good craft, silly story
","the movie is entertaining. camera and editing are really great and work very well with the music. the acting is OK. but denzel washington did better in other movies. he's playing all emotions with his mouth. that's boring after a while. the story is confusing. when doug is following the suspect with that tracing device on the highway to save the girl, he causes a lot of collateral damage. the point in the story is to avoid that people get killed or hurt. but the life of the girl is suddenly worth more, than other lives. that is stupid. also the attraction between doug and the girl comes out of nowhere. he's looking on her through that wormhole and she never saw him before. but suddenly they kiss, as if they were in love for quite a time. for real they know each other for one or two hours. and last, when doug is investigating he finds lot of evidence leading to himself, that he must have been on the crime scene before all the events took place, but he never traveled to the past before. so how can he find something that never happened, or not has happened? i think better and smarter thriller were shot in the past.",5,0,1,1 May 2007
