Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Never could this live up to the hype.
","Never ever could Star Wars live up to the hype and I am sure many people went into the cinema with their minds made up - this won't be as good as the others. Fair enough. No Darth Vader, evil Empire or tie fighters and X-Wings. The mysteriousness and evil of Star Wars we all love is missing in this first episode of a great saga.George made a few mistakes. He did not listen. George Lucas did not direct episodes V and VI of Star Wars and hired someone to fix his screenplays before shooting. This is why the original trilogy was of such great quality - it was edited by professionals not Lucas. This time, he thought he could do it himself and the film suffered. The film often dragged and many parts could have been left out. He lost his focus and I'm sure he had the merchandise in one eye when he wrote the film. He could have used some serious help but chose not to take it and finished with a disappointment that could have been THE greatest movie of all time. I hope he'll be more open for the episodes II and III.Despite this, the film was good. The acting by the main stars was quite impressive although that Jake Lloyd has to go! (Where was that Sixth Sense kid at the Anakin Skywalker auditions?) I dunno who conjured Darth Maul but someone got something right when they invented him. His part in the movie was too small and I can't believe George Lucas didn't realise how much he could have been a part of the movie instead of the four or five scenes he only got.I don't think the film was as bad as people made out. Jar Jar Binks should've been left out, something scarier than the Trade Federation could have been used and comicness we could have done without thanks George, while the kids were impressed you lost many fans.One last thing, I think (personally) George Lucas had his mind on the critics so (childishly and amaturely) tried to make the film complicated in the wrong ways ie. he tried to make a complicated plot and story, but got it wrong. Instead he had a simple story that lost the plot trying to be complicated (taxation of trade routes???)Give credit where credits due however. An impressive attempts with its faults. I can't wait for the next too. LETS SEE THIS BOY TURN BAD!",10,0,1,30 June 2000
X-Men," Enough Said.
","I finally have seen this one after waiting ages to get to the cinema and I was not disappointed. I've read the reviews and I have a few things to say...i) There are characters missing in the movie because the film had to be for people unfamiliar with the movie not just the fans. Too many characters would have been too confusing. People would have got lost with who's who.ii) The character development was small because the movie would have dragged otherwise, and besides, there are so many characters to develop. Think about it - Wolverine, Cyclops, Rouge, Jean Grey, Professor X, Magneto, Sabertooth, Mystique, Toad and Storm - that's a lot of characters to try and develop in such a small space of time.iii) The screenplay wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. It was actually kinda impressive given the movie. I've said it before and I'll say it again, a complicated plot doesn't constitute a good movie. Some movies are just as good without them. Besides, what were you expecting? William Shakespeare?iv) It's got lots of special effects and sfx, but could you really have a movie without them? Bet the same people complaining it was all special effects and no plot would be the same people that would have been complaining if it had a good story and no special effects. I can hear them moaning now, 'Where are the special effects... etc...' You just can't please these people, ever!v) There were a lot of loose ends because there is so much more to happen. The comics have been going for so long. Hey the cartoon series took about 15 episodes to cover this entire mutant Registation thing and who knows how many comics. Then there's Apocolyse, the Phoenix and Sinister etc. to go on with. There's a lot of stuff to try and tie up. This is a 30 plus year amount of stuff we're talking about! Besides, in reality if they had have tried to tie up all the loose ends the ending would have been really untidy and clustered and all rushed and it would never have worked, unless the movie went for four hours.vi) Leave the realistic/ realism stuff alone please! Yes there are continuity and factual problems. Let it go please. That's why they're called movies. For heaven's sake, please leave your brains at home and bring your imaginations with you. You're spoiling the fun.vii) Some people had there minds already made up about this movie and what they would think of it - cheezy comic remake, plot holes, bad script, not doing the film justice and nobody, not ever me can convince these arrogant people other wise.No need to mention Hugh Jackman. Enough said. Least nobody is hoeing into him.>Saint Just",10,0,0,28 July 2000
Alien," What do people see in this film
","What do people see in this film? I am not one for horror films, though I do like this alien stuff. Nothing happens in the film. Nothing. We spent most of the time waiting and waiting for something to happen. This movie could have been cut to half an hour, easy. There is a saying that says that fear is being scared of the unknown, something that the X-Files has done really well.Unfortunately, this film has tried to do this too and has gone too far. Rather than waiting for something to happen, while on the edge of our seats, we wait and wait and wait and wait. We barely get to see the alien and the special effects are pretty poor. Sure it was a long time ago so we can't expect too much, but look at Star Wars which came out around the same time. They were much better than alien and Lucas had half the money.Alien is simply a boring movie that deserves no credit.",1,51,173,29 May 1999
Alien," slow and dull
","This movie is very slow, very dull and very boring. After waiting half an hour for the movie to start after many long and dull shots at the area, the movie begins to move. After lots and lots of boring visuals, the story begins to move, though never takes off. Personally I hated the movie and has been given a vote of one by me in the user vote.I don't recommend you see it, but it's vote of 8.2 by other viewers might suggest otherwise. My personal opinion is that it was made in 1977 so people have just voted for it as a classic.It deserves nothing as a classic.No stars",1,43,155,14 August 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," The best English comedy since Monty Python came to town.
","When you lose half a million dollars to a porn king, what do you do if you can't pay up? Do you...a) take out a loan?b) hand over your father's bar to pay off the debt?c) knock off near a million dollars of dope and cash from your next door neighbour?Unfortunately, if you choose answer 'c', you may find yourself in the sticky situation Tom, Soap, Bacon and Eddy find themselves in in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.This has a nice mixture between humour, violence and acts of downright stupidity, as we see the gangsters of London do what they do best, cheat, thieve and screw up!Put this on your must see list.",10,0,0,2 August 1999
The Matrix," Oh my God! This one has a story
","I must admit I went to this movie expecting a lot of special effects with a story written by a two year old. How I was shocked. This one actually had a story to follow. Not the depth of some films, but very impressive for this kind of genre.Keanu Reeves (Bill and Ted) is very impressive in this film, but isn't he always? As for Lawrence Fishburne, well, a superb effort, making his character the best in the film. Australian Carrie-Anne Moss plays the part of the plastic wearing (remind you of catwoman???) martial arts babe with superb acting.What is the Matrix? Well I better not spoil it. But it does remind me of Lucas' 'the force!'This is a very impressive film, definitely tailor made for the big screen.Unfortunately the ending is a let down, there seemed to be something missing in it. Maybe it finishes a little too abruptly.Some never to be forgotten scenes and some good humor. And no action mainstream flick is incomplete with the romance. We wait a while, but it does add something to the film.Around and 7 or 8 out of ten for the Matrix - two marks off for the ending, one mark off for the fact that generally i don't like your mainstream action 'the hero seems to be bullet proof and the bad guys get unlucky kinda stallone or scharzenneger films! If I'm nice I might give it an extra mark for the fact that it had a story!",10,0,0,29 May 1999
