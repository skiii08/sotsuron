The Blair Witch Project," stunning realistic and so scary
","The Blair witch project is an extraordinary movie. I've seen it on internet (I know, it's a shame but I was so excited to see it). Filmed like a documentary (but maybe, it's one- check out the official website-), this flick 's got a really strange atmosphere. No special effects (because of a low, very low budget) but the actors are great to share their fear with you. You really feel that it's not a movie and that it has really happened (watch Funny Games if you like that). A really terrifying movie which will make you hate camping in forest.",9,1,2,22 June 1999
