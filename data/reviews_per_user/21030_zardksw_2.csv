The King's Speech," Kings speech is emotionally real story.
","The King's Speech is based on real story. And I like movie which is based on real story. As I expected, this movie was interesting. I recently saw this movie because of my friend's recommendation for this movie. I interestingly saw this movie for running time. I like Colin Firth's acting. and clearly in this movie, Colin Firth's a stuttering acting was very good. And Geoffrey Rush's acting also good for me. Specially, I like last 10minutes during entire movie. Speech George VI with Lionel was very moved. And i felt that this was good speech for that time. Anyway this movie was very moved and i will recommend this movie to other friends.",7,0,0,16 May 2015
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," The memory is erased, but love exist
","The memory is erased, but love exist. This is a main subject of this movie. To begin with I confused this story. What director say to us? Because I don't understand the first some cut of this movie. But as times go, Consequently I know the meaning at the end of the movie time. Joel hope to erase the memory with Clementine, But he couldn't. And eventually they love again. I remembered Nietzsche's famous saying, 'Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders'. I surprised Jim carrey and Kate Winslet's acting. I first saw the main actor this movie. Honestly I don't believed this acting because Jim Carrey was famous for comedy acting and I never think about Kate Winslet like this character. But two actors gratefully acted their role. And I well concentrated on this movie This movie was very interesting and moved my mind. And I also recommend this movie and I will see this movie twice in my life.",8,0,2,19 May 2015
