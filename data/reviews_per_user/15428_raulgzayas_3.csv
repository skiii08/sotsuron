The Avengers," The sum of all parts= The Avengers rock!
","Luck was on our side to all Marvel's Universe fans in Mexico since The Avengers premiered this Friday 04/27 just one week previous to the US release. Yes, the movie is great, Yes the acting is really good, Double yes on special effects, especially the ones related to the great battle in the city. Now what would I personally did not grant a perfect review of this most anticipated reunion of this eclectic group of superheroes?Because I do personally believe it took the movie too long to separate the individual characters into the actual group. Of course this is a personal opinion and even it might be possible this is exactly how the screenplay was actually written, but nevertheless... If the Hunger Games has any potential contender of putting a fight on this still baby-year in movies, The Avengers is the one movie that has what it takes to give a good one.What can you expect from this movie... Tons of action? Of course Some light background on each of the main players? Sure thing Humor? Not as much as you could have and certainly, the biggest laugh in the theater came from a scene of the least expected character... trust me on this one!So all in all, this is a GREAT movie to watch... the 2+ hours just fly by and I exited the theater satisfied with Director Joss Whedon job. I almost agreed with another review stating that all main characters did have at least one big scene during the film, yet part of the missing point of my rating is that, in my mind, Iron Man/Tony Stark appearance during the film was somehow larger than the rest of the characters.I am not a connoisseur of the actual comic, but it would dare to guess that the majority of the hard core fans of this history will be pleased.Of course this is not Oscar material, but hey, this type of movies (Harry Potter, Batman, Superman, etc) is the reason we go to the movies... to escape reality for some time and and root for the good guys.And these assembly of actors portraying these superheroes did a wonderful job.Oh... and maybe last, but definitely not least, Samuel L Jackson on his role of Director Nick Fury is great and you can definitely tell there are more than a couple of SLJ's personal touches on his performance that become the cherry on this exquisite and enjoyable cake known as The Avengers.",9,2,6,29 April 2012
Iron Man 3," A good entertaining movie, but NOT the best of the series...
","OK... let me start by saying I personally watch movies for either two reasons: either to be entertained or to enjoy great acting and cinematography ( directing, photography, writing, etc), sometimes a movie get kudos on both aspects, sometimes, just on one, sometimes just fail miserably. Iron Man 3 is a movie to watch to be entertained... period. I am not expert of the superhero mythology, so I cannot have an opinion on that. The plot start at some point in time after the events where the Avengers save the world in NYC. Yes, there are some development on the character of Tony Stark.. that self-centered, egocentric, and eccentric billionaire that Mr Downey Jr. has played so well on the previous three movies ( including The Avengers), he will realize even when he is Iron Man, he's still human, so the lesson that he will learn is that being in the limelight does have a cost, and sometimes that cost might affect and even make you lose the people around you. I do think this is the movie of the series that have tried ( because not all are good) to exploit the joke element the most..I let you be the judged of that. I still do think that the first movie is the best. As for the villain? well, personally I think for entertaining purposes and my personal rating, that's exactly why this one does not rate better for me , and once again, personally, the worst of the villains Iron Man has faced so far...why? simple...they never explained the reason WHY he do it, plus a big disappointed for me when Tony finally faces The Mandarin. If you enjoyed the previous two, would you be disappointed on the third? Absolutely not, but you might step out of the theather sharing one of the more repeated commentary on all movie blockbuster sagas since Star Wars : 'It was good, but the first one is still the best for me'- Enjoy.",7,1,5,28 April 2013
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," YES... it is better than the first one....
","Just back from the theater after watching Spider Man 2... in 2D ( sorry... not a big 3D fan) I am not a superhero/comic fan, so my review is based on my personal opinion on my expectations for this type of film... an entertaining experience, and I am happy to say, this one delivers! Not only the action sequences were great, I do think even the screenplay, the acting and even how the story evolves thru the film is way superior than it's predecessor.Jaime Foxx is superb on his role, and as it usually happens when you finished watching a good action film... you probably will ask for a little more, but what you just watched was good enough anyway! Just as the Batman/Dark Knight reboot, this new delivery of Spidey is a Little more 'dark' than the previous one from Sam Raimi, not only because on this new series, we learn something about Peter Parker childhood ( re:their parents), but because as Uncle Ben said once, Mr Parker starts to really ponder that with great power comes great responsibility, and that a superhero lifestyle is not always so nice... (ask Tony Stark-IM3)If I have to compare SM2 vs. Captain America- Winter Soldier, the good 'ol Captain might win the battle for half a point, but Spidey will have people smiling at the end of the movie... and just as Batman, it would be nice if a third and final installment can be already in the works to close this latest update 'refresh' on our friendly neighbor... The Amazing Spider Man!",8,9,22,20 April 2014
