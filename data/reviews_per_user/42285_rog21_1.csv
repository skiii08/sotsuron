Requiem for a Dream," hard to watch, but worth the time
","This movie may be the hardest movie I have ever had to get through in terms of watching people destroy themselves. The performances in this movie are amazing and you feel their pain with each fix. That and Wayans redeems himself for D&D. I don't need to mention Ellen Burstyn. But I think I need to mention a very underrated actor despite the small part. Keith David. This guy chews up the screen whether you see him or just hear his voice. Great cast, great director, great movie. Downward spiral. Rock bottom. Damn it's hard to watch these people fall, but it's easy to watch a superbly structured film.",8,0,1,25 October 2004
