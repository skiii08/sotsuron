The Blair Witch Project," The scariest film ever made.
","Forget Freddy and Jason.  This is one frightening film.  The performances by the entire cast are excellent.  It is a very cold, dark, and hair-raising film.  Just the thought of it being a true-story makes you want to curl up under the covers.",10,1,3,19 July 1999
As Good as It Gets," Best film of 1997!
","This is by far the best film of 1997!  The hell with 'Titanic'.  That movie didn't have the performance level, script, and directing this one did.  Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars (Actor and Actress) for playing their very different New Yorker characters.  Jack (my favorite modern actor) is hilarious as an obsessive compulsive, and Helen (one of my favorite modern actresses) is the light of the movie as a waitress.  The only thing that suprises me is the fact that Greg Kinnear didn't win the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  He is superb as a gay artist that gets attacked and is down on his luck.  Take my word if you  see one film from 1997, this is it.",Null,2,2,28 July 1999
Forrest Gump," Good film...not great...
","This is a very good film, but not great.  I think that after seeing it over and over again it isn't all it's cracked-up to be.  Tom Hanks is a good actor, but why did he win the Oscar?  I think the Academy just wanted to make history with a consecutive Oscar win again.  He did deserve the Oscar for 'Philadelphia' though.  The basic facts are if you like Hanks watch 'Philadelphia' or 'Big'.  If you like Sally Field watch 'Norma Rae'.  If you like Sinese and Wright though watch this one.",Null,1,2,28 July 1999
Singin' in the Rain," The best musical ever
","I am not a huge fan of movie musicals.  I only like this one and 'The Music Man'.  This one is the best I've ever seen.  Every time Gene Kelly sings the title song, I always whistle along.  It is really close to being perfect. Donald O'Connor, Debbie Reynolds, and especially Jean Hagen make this an excellent movie.",10,1,4,22 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Very dark psychological film!
","Just when you think Kubrick hasn't found something to shock us with, he finds Hollywood's power couple.  He has used sex before, though...in LOLITA. This was a lushly sexual film, less than the opening trailor says, but still very sexy. This will be a sure-fire Oscar contender.  I believe Kubrick will win for something...maybe Screenplay.",10,0,0,19 July 1999
Titanic," One of the worst films ever
","It isn't that this film is bad.  It would be good if it didn't receive all the hype that it got.  Why in the world would it win Best Picture Oscar. That should have went to L.A. Confidential or As Good As It Gets.  I do enjoy Kathy Bates in everything I see and Kate Winslet was all right.  But James Cameron's cheap theatrics with a false love story aboard the doomed ship was just a way to sell tickets, and adding 'DiCraprio' was just icing on the cake for him.  If you like good movies, rent 'Boogie Nights' and if you like a Titanic movie, rent 'A Night to Remember', please.",Null,6,10,6 August 1999
To Kill a Mockingbird," One of America's definitive films
","This film evokes the most noble of human emotions against America and racism.  Gregory Peck gives a well-deserved Oscar winning performance as a southern lawyer that defends a black man in a rape trial.  What a storyline, wonderfully adapted from the Harper Lee novel.  Great cast, especially Badham.  This is the film of the 1960s, in my humbleist opinion.
***** out of *****",Null,0,1,7 August 1999
The Bridge on the River Kwai," The greatest British war movie ever!
","This is a perfect film.  I have seen some wonderful films, but this one is absolutely PERFECT.  Perfectly directed, written, and acted, with a well-deserved Oscar for Guinness.  Though this film isn't as graphic as war movies like 'Platoon' or 'Saving Private Ryan', it is still brutally honest and very harsh.  If you haven't seen this, I suggest that you do quickly.",Null,0,1,22 July 1999
