First Man," Superb movie about mankinds greatest achievement
","We did not have to high hopes when we went and saw this movie. But boy, we were wrong!
I just loved the 60s feeling they managed to capture with the camera handling, to the closeups and so one. Very beautiful done!
And the visual effects are just spectacular. When we saw this at the cinema, the sound was just awesome! The scene when the Saturn rocket takes off was just magnificent when it comes to the sound and visual effects!Characters feels very real and Ryan did a great job with Neil. Not much to complain about here.The music really makes this movie just. Such a beautiful score and the scene when Neil steps out on the moon is just breathtaking. How they manage to capture to loneliness of being in space and far away from Earth, to the beauty and emptiness of standing on the moon.I don't know why people says this is a boring movie. What do you expect? An action packed movie with explosions and warp drives? We got a glims into the life of an extraordinary human being and NASAs mission to land a man on the moon. I think the movie makers did a good selective part in portraying the greatest achievement of mankind.If this movie doesn't win one or more Oscars, I will be VERY VERY surprised.",9,0,1,26 December 2018
