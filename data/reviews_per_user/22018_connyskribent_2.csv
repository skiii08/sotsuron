The Ring," Creepy & Scary
","I will have trouble sleeping tonight...The Ring is a very creepy and suspenseful movie. I read some comments about this movie 'not being scary'...Well, if you don´t find this movie to be scary I don´t know what will get you guys going. Personally I think this kind of horrormovie is more frightening than blood & gore-movies like 'Jason X'. 8/10.",Null,1,1,15 March 2003
Blade II," So much action - still pretty boring...
","I haven´t actually seen the first Blade, but I got into it pretty quickly. I mean, what is there really to understand? It´s a Vampire fairytale, with a twist to it. Fights. Blood. Gore. And a bit of that fighting again. I have seen a lot of movies worse than Blade, but it could have been done much better if the main characters were explained better. Blade is supposed to, I suppose, to be the good guy. But to me he is just a dark and dull character with about five lines in the whole movie. Good effects though and younger viewers (12-15) will probably love it! 2/5.",Null,1,2,10 October 2002
