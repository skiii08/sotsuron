Mission: Impossible III," The Best of the Three
","I am somewhat mystified by some of the comments that talk of episodes one and two being so good.Lets remind ourselves:Ep 1 - Fly a helicopter down the channel tunnel! Ep 2 - Ballet on motorcycles!I own neither of these films as they are so flawed, although with occasional flashes of mediocrity.I found episode three to be the best to date. They have, unfortunately, retained the idea of perfect face masks and voice simulators, together with bullets that bounce of car bodywork and other action film conceits...no doubt the source of 'Impossible' used in the title.If you want a good night out without any thought required I'd recommend this, 'Welcome back Mr Hunt, another helping of gratuitous violence?'Martin",7,0,1,5 May 2006
Star Trek," Curate Egg - Good in parts
","The Good:Casting - At worst OK, at best excellent.Special Effects - A lot of great work is used simply as background, as it should be. There were a lot of nice touches - going from the loud emergency inside a craft to the silence of space.Relationships between characters - This is where this film really does nail it.The prologue - Very effecting, although I think Roddenberry would have hated it.Direction I liked the way the camera was continually taken off at odd angles. Generally the camera was used very dynamically.Historic Nods - lots are used without being too distracting.The Bad:The plot - It really doesn't work. The more you think about it the more holes you can punch in it.Worth watching, but concentrate on the characterisation and park your brain at the door.M",7,2,9,9 May 2009
Spider-Man 3," Good comic book film
","This film is NOT full of insight into the human condition. This film does NOT contain a fully logical plot line. This film does NOT contain a proper timeline.BUT it IS based on a comic!I enjoyed what was on the screen enough to take my family, and some friends, to see it twice; more than SM 1 or 2.This film does contain:Some great special effects; Some great action sequences; Enough character development to actually get involved and know the characters who are maimed or killed - and care.I think part of the issue for this, and most comic book films, is that they are a hiding to nothing trying to satisfy the character fan-base.Equally there are enough weaknesses in this film that I would normally be happily be pulling it to pieces, but the film's positive elements meant that I could skate over them rather than dwelling on them.I thoroughly enjoyed it, two hours of mindless entertainment - well, what do you expect of a comic!",7,1,2,12 May 2007
