The Longest Yard," Brilliant
","I love this film, it's just got that dry humor in it. If you enjoyed any of Adam Sandlers other films or you like American Football or even the original the longest yard you'll love this film. It has the typical Sandler trates to it such as two regulars of his films are in it. And the mix of Pro wrestlers also makes it brilliant, especially since you see Kevin Nash's character is completely different to his wrestling persona. It's so violent at parts but comically funny at the same time (the violence I mean). I could watch this film every week or so and not get bored of it, it's just so cleverly made. It has everything you'd want, A massively strong guy who's as emotionally weak as a baby, Men on hormone pills (LOL!!) and then of course the serious story line of power made corruption.",10,1,3,23 April 2006
