Iron Man 3," Just okay, lots of flaws
","I very much enjoyed the first two Iron Man films as well as the Avengers, this one however while it certainly had some fun moments does not rise to the level of the others.If the film is to be taken as nothing more than a 'popcorn flick', then it's short comings are that it is too slow, too long and at points my seven year old complained of being bored.If it is intended to be more than just a popcorn flick, then the shortcomings would become far more numerous; here are a few things I noticed (I'll do my best not to spoil the movie too much)...-Tony Stark has some 'episodes' throughout the film', where he is sort of shell shocked from his experience in the Avengers, the problem is that it is done almost comically, so it is never taken to be something serious, and worse still has absolutely no pay off.-For a large part of the movie Tony is without his suit as it is being charged up by his new little protégé. During this time he is desperate to get to the Mandarin before the next imminent attack. Eventually, his suit is fully charged and he re-acquires it, but later we find out that he has an entire army of Iron Man suits he could've hailed at any time, which pretty much makes the entire second act of the film pointless.-There are two other such moments that quickly come to mind. One is when he is fighting two powerful opponents. The first one almost does him in, but he takes her out with an elaborate explosive he make-shifts on the fly. About two minutes later we find out he actually has a hidden palm blaster hidden on his person he could've used before.-The next one really bugged me. Aboard Air Force One, Iron Man takes out a baddie who is on top of him using his chest blaster. Towards the end of the film the main bad guy is in virtually the same position above him, and instead of using the blaster that worked so well before, he does pretty much nothing, then tries to fight him with a sword blade that pops out of his suit.-BIG SPOILERS AHEAD... the revelation of the true nature of the Mandarin will probably infuriate fans of the original comic series (of which I am not), but for me it was simply anti-climactic, and to be honest, not all that 'shocking'.-As the film comes to a close, I'll suffice to say it is a tad ambiguous, in that it almost suggests that he is hanging up the Iron Man suit, as it were, and yet in his closing monologue he states that he IS Iron Man. This is actually a bit annoying to me because like everyone, I know there is another Avengers movie up coming, so they are obviously going to have to come up with some kind of contrived situation to get him back into the suit. More than that though, it really robs Tony Stark's character of the kind of cocky, narcissistic attributes that made him so awkwardly endearing in the first place.To be clear, I didn't hate the film, just noticed that the bad story points really stuck out. There was a really neat scene in which Tony, similar to the first film, has to construct weapons out of odds and ends. I just wish they'd milked this scene a bit more because it could've been a lot cooler than it was.Personally I wish I had've waited until it showed up on Netflix.",5,4,8,4 May 2013
The Hunger Games," Good story, poor film.
","I haven't read the book but my brother and wife both loved it. The trailers made it look like 'The Running Man', so had it not been for them I would have had no interest in this whatsoever.Within the first ten minutes I thought the film was either directed by a woman or made for teen-aged girls based solely on the camera work and editing. The shots of Katniss were brief with shaky hand-held camera work, while the shots of Gale were needlessly long, smooth and drawn out. Also, I can't believe that a film with male audience in mind could ever make Elizabeth Banks ugly.Katniss decides to volunteer to be a 'tribute' so her little sister does not have to. They made it seem like being a tribute was a really bad thing, but didn't really give much explanation as to what it meant which really weakened what is a pretty central story point. Maybe they just assumed people would go in knowing that being a tribute meant being pitted in a mortal battle with peers, but it only took me one sentence to explain it, so they should have been able to find a way to squeeze it in.So Katniss and Peeta are named as the tributes for their city -- which is called Sector 12. They are taken onto a train in a scene that is filmed as though they are prisoners being taken into a concentration camp, the only problem here is that the train is filled with lots of fancy food and luxury (something seldom found in concentration camps). So the film style tended to tell us contradicting things.Peeta and Katniss arrive in a city full of weirdos that immediately made me think they were now in the land of OZ. Katniss then had a scrub-down which only reinforced the Wizard of Oz parallels in my mind. I'm all for homages, but they have to be subtle or they come off looking like a rip off, such as in this case.The next part of the film is probably the hardest to sit through as it is a long, dry series of sequences where the tributes from the various sectors are interviewed and trained in preparation for the games. What makes this more frustrating is that the film skips over all of Peeta and Katniss's competitors. If the filmmakers thought they couldn't do it properly they shouldn't have attempted it at all. They did find time to waste with Katniss's farewells to the new friends she made (which also wreaked of Dorothy's farewell to her friends in Oz).Now the games begin, and being a sucker for action movies I was really hopeful that this would turn the film around. Actually it did get better from this point on, but there was one major flaw that became apparent very quickly: The filmmakers were trying to make a PG-13 film about mass slaughter.What that meant in this case was using annoyingly shaky hand-held camera work to try to camouflage the violence. It didn't make it intense or interesting, it just felt like another cop-out.One by one the secondary characters die off while the world watches. One thing that did bother me a bit was when Katniss dropped a nest of wasps on a bunch of unwitting people below. It bothered me for a couple reasons: one was that these killer wasps didn't seem to affect Peeta, who was with the group below, and also because it's a well known fact that wasps will fly up... so the only thing that should've happened is that they would fly up and sting Katniss unmercifully.Katniss befriends a young girl who reminds her of her little sister, but inevitably the young girl is knocked off. This leads to a bit of a rebellion in the young girl's home sector, which is, from what I know of the story, a precursor of future events. The rebellion scene was actually the one moment in the film where the story shone through and became easily the best scene of the film.Katniss and Peeta team up for the final leg of the film and eventually outwit the game's creators by attempting a Romeo and Juliette type scheme of poisoning themselves. It's a little convoluted, but for some reason the show's brass seems to think that if these two both die they will beat them at their own game. Personally I'd let them die and then laugh.So Peeta and Katniss are now global celebrities, which is another point that is not really clear... why would you make these peasants that you hate so much that you make their children fight to the death celebrities? Anyway, Gale, who has been watching the whole Peeta and Katniss romance blossom on television turns up and there is a hint given that Katniss is actually more interested in Gale... so what concerns me now, is that not only have these filmmakers savaged what was a pretty good story, but they've also pointed the sequel in the direction of Twilight, and there are already too many of those films.I'm sure that some people who have already read the book(s) will enjoy seeing some of the things from coming to life, but I've always felt that the best adaptations make you want more, and a want to read the source material. This film did not do that for me, which is a bit of a shame because there are some good things in the story. If I were the author I'd be livid.",4,9,12,28 March 2012
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Good but underwhelming.
","What made this film less than what it should've been are first of all the lucky coincidences/conveniences:(eg. he is coincidentally situated perfectly to spot the Vulture's thugs who happen to be robbing the bank across the street from his favorite deli.While on the roof at Liz's house party Spider-man happens to see a huge blue explosion goes off that apparently no one else sees.Vulture drops Spidey from the air but luckily he falls into a lake, and luckily his suit even has a built-in air dryer, and luckily the Vulture happened to inadvertently drop one of his precious magic rocks and Spiderman coincidentally found it.Peter learns that Vulture's gang is headed to Washington DC and wouldn't you know it, but his Math wiz club, is also going to DC at this exact same time.Spiderman, trapped in a high security storage facility, hacks the security panel by randomly punching in numbers, and conveniently gets it right eventually without sounding any alarms.While he is doing this his math club is conveniently winning their award despite the fact that Peter is supposed to be their star member, making his absence ultimately inconsequential.Spidey gets to his friends in the nick of time, disposes of the bomb seconds before it explodes and saves the girl he happens to have a crush on.Peter apologizes to Liz for bailing, and conveniently she not only completely forgives him, but agrees to be his date to homecoming because apparently no one else has asked the hottest girl in school.Spiderman decides to interrogate a hardened criminal who apparently never learned that ratting is a bad idea in the underworld because he tips Spidey off as to where Vulture's next big hit is.On the ferry he intercepts the thugs' planned weapon sale but coincidentally the FBI are aboard too for no explained reason, and they stupidly hold Spiderman at gunpoint. But conveniently, the Vulture, seeing this, stupidly makes a car-destroying scene that distracts the FBI and allows Spidey to escape.In the chaos the boat is cut in half but when Spidey can't fix it Tony as Ironman comes to the rescue.Peter goes to pick up Liz and who opens the door but the Vulture... who is coincidentally her father.Peter, now with his homemade suit goes to chase after vulture, but one of his thugs – Shocker – is waiting for him for some reason and attacks him in the school parking lot. Spidey is almost done for when this time Ned rescues him.Vulture topples a building on Peter and then flies away. Luckily for Peter, after collapsing the building, the Vulture doesn't bother to stick around to make sure he's dead. Luckier still, Vulture went to a nearby billboard to sit and watch for Stark's plane. Even luckier still, the Vulture doesn't notice Peter escaping from the rubble and subsequently webbing onto Vulture. Even luckier still, when Vulture says to his helper that he notices some drag the person on the other end brushed it off, because you know, aerodynamics is such an imperfect science.Anyway you get the idea)But there was one single scene that brought this movie down a star or two... When pursuing the Vulture, rather than giving us an awesome swinging scene, they had Spider-Man steal a kid's car, drive like a maniac endangering lives and destroy the car.Grand theft auto is not the Spider-Man I wanted to see.",5,5,9,11 July 2017
Man of Steel," Superman Begins
","I was lucky enough to attend an advanced screening of Man of Steel, and my biggest worry was that it would not live up to expectations. To be honest I think I'll have to see it again to properly gauge how it matched my anticipation.It is a very fun film, and it is also very much a science-fiction film, which we should probably expect, but coming from the creative team who worked to hard to make Batman grounded in reality, this one does not try to hide its fantasy elements.The film opens on Krypton as Kal-El is born to Jor-El and Lara. Shortly after Jor-El is appealing to the Krypton elders to evacuate their dying planet. Supposedly they have exhausted their planets natural resources, and as a result the planet itself will implode.In the midst of this, General Zod is attempting a coup to overthrow the elders and preserve the Kryptonian future in his own way. This leads to a confrontation between Zod and Jor-El as he is in the process of evacuating his son -- which brings up my first couple of problems with the movie: Jor-El swims through this lake of embryos to get something called the 'codex' which is what Zod plans to use to rebuild the Kryptonian race... the thing is, if this was so vital to Zod's plan, and so easy to obtain it's a bit of a stretch to think that Krypton's greatest tactical leader would not have the foresight to secure it before barging in on the council.As Kal-El's parents are putting him into the space pod the dialogue between Jor-El and Lara is eerily similar to the conversation in Superman: the movie. Since they were trying so hard to set this movie apart from the previous series, I was a bit disappointed in this choice.Next, as Jor-El is evacuating Kal-El, he reveals that Kal is the first natural birth in centuries, which sends Zod in to a rage, screaming 'Herecy!'. Now to be fair, this might just be an under developed plot point, but there are issues here... first of all it is unclear if this has been done with the blessing of the elders or not. The elders are clearly against evacuating the planet, so they are probably not wise to Jor-El sending his son away. So this suggests that Jor-El is rebelling against the council, which seems to be exactly what makes Zod a villain. Furthermore, if it is such heresy on Krypton to have a natural birth that would mean that Lara would have to have hid her pregnancy for nine months, which alone seems a bit of a stretch.Moments after Kal-El is shipped off, General Zod is captured by Krypton authorities, tried and shipped to the phantom zone... now this had me scratching my head at the time. These guys have the resources and ability to ship these criminals to safety yet they will not evacuate their law-abiding citizens somewhere safe? The story flashes forward to Clark Kent's adult life, where he is on what I believe is a crab fishing boat. It actually only took a couple of minutes for them to stick a big fat flaw in... Clark is in the path of a falling crab cage, when one of his fellow fishermen dives at him football style knocking him out of the way to 'safety'. You cannot knock down the man of steel! in fact not long after this, a gruff trucker tries to hit Clark and bounces off of him... moving on...Adult Clark moves from place to place while we get glimpses of his childhood where he struggles with being different and having to keep his abilities secret for mankind's own good. It is very similar in structure to Batman Begins, but that worked well for Batman, so you can't really fault them for trying this format with Superman... mind you if they make Green Lantern begins I'll be livid.Clark (who is calling himself Joe) crosses paths with Lois Lane at a military site where they have discovered something very curious... why the military decides to indulge top secret information to a reporter is beyond me, but feels a little bit like shameless exposition.Now I'll be honest, I'm a bit confused by what follows but maybe I just need to see it again. I believe this anomaly that the military found was a scout ship that was sent to Earth by Jor-El in advance of sending Kal-El -- I'm not totally sure about what it is doing on the other side of the planet from where they sent him nor how Clark even found it, but hopefully in time I'll understand that bit too.Anyway, this is a ship that Clark flies away in to be instructed by Jor-El and be given his Krytonian garb... which is really cool, except that the first few times we see him, the low cut top makes his upper-chest hair look like an escaping spider the first few times we see him. It was pretty distracting on an Imax screen.The final third of the movie is just balls-to-the wall action... and this is where the movie really comes into its own. It was nice to see Krypton foes mercilessly bashing the crap out of one another. And unlike Superman II, Superman wasn't preoccupied with saving all the citizens from falling debris, which was a welcomed change, instead he was beating and being beaten on an epic level.I really think the measure of how good this film is will be the sequel. Can Man of Steel improve on itself the way the Dark Knight series did? I think the potential is definitely there!",8,2,8,14 June 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Great display of film mastery
","This was the first film I watched after seeing The Hunger Games, and it may sound weird, but in comparison this felt like a 'real film'. I haven't read the book or seen the Swedish version, but this film definitely made me interested in seeing it (and its sequels) which is all you can really ask for in an adaptation. In stark contrast Hunger games didn't give me any interest in reading the book, strengthening the quality of this film.Fincher made some brilliant choices in this film that could have easily gone unnoticed, for example when Lisbeth is about to be raped the camera pulls away from the room and fades to black. In a lesser film this would be the end of the scene, but Fincher throws us right back into it by cutting back into the room and forcing us to witness the rape. It's a great way to manipulate the audience expectations, and it reminded me of something Akira Kurosawa said: 'The role of the artist is to not look away'. In this scene alone Fincher proves his artistry.I'll admit that the story is a bit slow paced in the beginning but it does a nice job of luring you into the two story-lines. Hopefully they will make the other two films.",8,7,13,31 March 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," A nice balance of action and drama
","I was initially worried about this movie since so many of the previous reviews suggested it was Twilight-esc. To be fair I've only seen about half of one twilight film (the first one), which was poor in pretty much every way and where it wasn't poor it was clichÃ©... This film however was actually quite good for what it was. I really enjoyed Spider-man and Spider-man 2, but I think the filmmakers really wanted to improve upon some of the weaknesses of the previous series, most of which seemed to have to do with character. All of the characters seem really well developed. Uncle Ben and Aunt May have a really neat dynamic and even almost an unspoken language of their own that makes them feel like they have a long history together. Flash Thompson even has an interesting arc.Of course Peter's past is the focal point of this story and it's done in a way that builds mystery and impacts the story greatly. It seems his father, Richard, was involved with Dr. Connors on cross-genetic research of some kind. His father was doing research involving spiders, and some of that work was continuing hence the lab where Peter gets bitten, but I'm not really sure how that relates to the reptile work Connors is doing. Maybe I missed it, or perhaps it was unclear.But this leads of course to Peter getting his powers a good hour or so into the film (though the pace is pretty good up to this point). His realization that he has powers and starting to use them is done fairly well, the only bad thing is that after an hour of building up to this point it seems a bit rushed. I felt the same with Uncle Ben's death.Another departure from the original series (but more true to the comics) is that he uses web-shooters, which made me nervous... I thought the idea of the webs being organic was brilliant, but they actually made this work really well, and even gave the devices some limitations.Overall the film seemed to strike a nice balance of action and drama, and felt a lot more grounded in reality than the original series (which sounds odd for a fantasy film). Stan Lee makes his trademark cameo in what is perhaps the best scene of the film! There were only two things I remember that really bugged me. One was in a scene after Lizard attacks the high school a male paramedic is attending to a student (I think it was flash) and he is wearing a really goofy-looking earring that I doubt a real paramedic would be allowed to wear on the job... The other thing was the CGI work in the very last scene. Throughout the whole film the effects were very seamless and never took me out of the movie, but in the last scene Spidey was obviously CGI.The ending was typical of Spider-man films in that he has to keep away from the girl for her own safety, but in order to be a happier ending he suggests that he intends to break the promise... that's fine, but I just hope that the sequel doesn't spend the whole time being a 'will-they-won't-they' film... Spider-man 2 already did that.",8,4,10,3 July 2012
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Not as good as Rings but still a lot of fun
","The Hobbit was filmed at 48 fps as opposed to the standard 24 fps. In the first Hobbit film I actually didn't notice a difference, but I really did in this one. In fact for the first half of the movie it was still bothering me. It felt like watching British television. Strangely it seemed even more-so during scenes that were filmed on a studio and had no music. For some reason the 48 fps seemed to actually make it feel LESS epic.The actual story was similar in tone to the book with one calamity after another befalling the dwarfs.It was the stuff they added that wasn't in the book that really slowed down the pace (Gandalf's investigation into the nature of the necromancer and the love story between Killi and Tauriel). That said I thought putting Legolas in was a great idea.Smaug was a highlight of the film. Every scene with him was really exciting and they seemed to do a good job of deflecting the story holes, for example, the absurdity of Smaug determining to attack the river city to get back at Bilbo and the Dwarfs.And then there's the ending I'm of two minds about the ending. In the first two Rings movies and the first Hobbit movie we were sort of lulled towards the end which left you wanting more, but wound down giving a sense of contentment. This one made no such attempts and was very abrupt. It was either a brilliant move or a terrible one, and I haven't decided yet which.",8,2,3,31 December 2013
Big Hero 6," Fun, but distractively poor dialogue
","This movie in general was a fun family movie, but it really asks you to suspend disbelief and tolerate some pretty poorly-written dialogue.The dialogue was especially bad in the early parts of the film when it felt like a lazily-written sitcom trying to economically tell you the backstory with unnatural and exposition-packed lines to explain the characters, their relationships to each other and their backstories.Because this is based on robots and advanced scifi technology it is a little difficult to get a true feeling for the world of this story.Character choices are a little bit confusing at times as well. For example Hiro invents the very technology that is turned against him (for reasons not really explained), and instead of making use of this technology he created to combat it, he turns to other inventions created by his brother and friends.Unfortunately I guessed two of the major plot 'twists' very early into the movie so the enjoyment factor was somewhat dampened by that as well.This probably sounds really negative. It's not. This was an enjoyable movie to sit and watch with the kids, but even they were scratching their heads at some of the story elements, so more intelligent writing would have served this movie well.",5,17,62,1 March 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," So much potential blown out of the sky.
","Let's think back the The Force Awakens (we will be doing a lot of that) -- the entire movie centered around a single plot device: Luke's lightsaber.So after waiting two years to learn the significance of this, Luke the old takes one look at the lightsaber hilt and nonchalantly chucks it away, essentially slapping us in the face for having been so stupid as to trust the filmmakers to pay this off.But having insulting payoffs doesn't end there. How about the whole mystery of Rey's parents? Well it seems the filmmakers wanted so badly to disprove all the fan theories that they decided to hand us another lump of turd by saying that her parents were... drum roll... NOBODY! Not the way Anakin had no father, but as in 'nobody' significant.The obvious place to begin with this review is to state how it blatantly rips off scenes from both Empire and Jedi, or perhaps that it decided to one-up Force Awakens' lame lightsaber battle by giving us NONE AT ALL, but instead I'm going to look at this from within the context of the Star Wars universe, in which 3 films stand out as particularly memorable -- Episodes IV, V and III.All of these films had interesting storylines, complex characters and took those characters to a place by the end where their entire world had changed.The characters in Episode VIII do nothing remotely close to this. Rey's so-called training on Degoba-er-Luke's Island, consists of little more than Luke voyeuristically watching her dance around with a lightsaber. Sure she has a scene like Degoba's deep dark cave where she sees herself reflected, but in this case it did nothing more than point us towards the red herring of her parents. In the end her 'new changed world' was simply her using the force to move some rocks to save her friends. Not much of an accomplishment for someone who already used the force in much more powerful ways in the previous film.Much like Force Awakens did, this one took familiar characters from the original trilogy and put them into a blender. Reluctant mentor Yoda became Luke, ethnically diverse character who turns on the heroes to save his own hide in Lando becomes both Rose and DJ (Del Toro).And yet none of this stupidity seems to be at the core of what annoyed the majority of Star Wars fans. There were two things that did...1. Leia miraculously surviving an explosion and getting sucked into outer space by using the force to fly to safety... now personally I don't mind the force part of this, to me it was almost the same way they can draw a lightsaber to themselves, she just did the reverse. But how the hell did her head no explode in deep space? What was she breathing?2. Luke's hologram at the end and demise. Yeah it was a bit of a cheap trick, but worse than that, it felt completely unnecessary. Not only that, it opens the door to a lot of potentially stupid things in the next movie, like maybe Rey has multiple holograms of herself for Kylo to fight (if they do this I think I'll die a little inside).I know I'm coming off as harsh, but there were some good moments. The film started out promising. Although Poe taking on the entire fleet by himself was a stretch, they sold it pretty well. I likes the scene where Snioke first talks to Kylo Ren because he calls him out immediately for two of the things that annoyed me about The Force Awakens: the fact that he wears a helmet for no reason whatsoever, and the fact that he was bested by a noob.There was also a scene towards the end where Finn was about to sacrifice himself to save the alliance... but just like the other previously mentioned scenes, they immediately went on to cock up something that had the potential to be really good. That's actually a good metaphor for the entire film. Even the comedic moments felt out of place - one in particular felt like it came right out of Spaceballs.I didn't think it was possible to anticipate a Star Wars film less than I anticipated this one, but they've managed to get me to a new level of disinterest. If that was the goal... job well done.",2,18,29,16 December 2017
It Chapter Two," Inferior to first one
","Here's the short... The film was definitely fun and entertaining. Although I didn't find it scary enough to be a horror movie nor funny enough to be a comedy, so it falls somewhere inbetween, making it a little bit of a confusing experience. But definitely fun.Where this movie shines is in the nostalgia. The first one did a great job of transporting us back to our own childhoods, and it was clear that we were seeing the world through the eyes of a child, with adults and bullies all being characatures. This one was almost a nostalgia overload as the kids came back to see their home town, yet I really liked those bits. I was a bit dissapointed that the theme of seeing the world through their eyes didn't continue, this time with kids being characatures.Perhaps my biggest problem with the film played itself out in the first couple of scenes...It opens with a gay couple who are attacked by a bunch of thugs simply for being gay... Something I would've bought maybe of we were still back in the 90's but this is taking place in present day. Not only was this a forced little piece of woke, it had absolutely no relevance to the plot, making the filmmakers look desperate to appear intersectional.The next issue was the following moments where we learn that Mike has been living above the library for years. Now in the original version this would make sense because Mike was the one obsessed with Derry, but for some reason in the first movie they made Ben the one that was into the history of the town, so they just abandoned that and instead decided to try to convince us that Ben was actually a prodigy architect, capable of building an underground structure most adults wouldn't be able to.These changes are odd because they don't lend themselves to the story in ways that could've been done otherwise.Steven king makes a cameo as a shop owner which had a lot more opportunities for jokes than they went for, which was a bit of a shame to be honest.The entire movie is sort of pointing towards the characters getting artifacts from their past to perform a ritual that is supposed to kill the monster. It kind of trudges through these sequences intercutting new scenes with the kids being terrorized by the clown. The scenes from the past are great when they shed light on their present, but boring when they try to include new suspense sequences because we already know they point to nothing.Another area that confused me was that in the first movie, the things that scared people were fake. But in this movie that seemed to change... To the extent that a zombie was chauffeuring the grown up Henry - so it makes for a confusion of the world we are in.The other thing that was somewhat frustrating was that Pennywise didn't have any clear goal. In the first one he woke from his slumber to feed on fear and kills kids along the way. Here it's like all he's doing is waiting around for the grown up version of these kids. The only other person he kills is the gay guy from the beginning a d a random kid which also seemed to be to get at Bill.It's a bit of a she because there was a lot of potential for this to be something special, but instead it took great casting and a great premise and didn't respect itself enough to give us a good ending - which is ironic seeing as one of the elements of the story is that Bill is a writer who is unable to write a good ending.Bottom line, it's fun but didn't live up to its own potential.",5,0,2,11 September 2019
Arrival," Long... slow arrival
","Arrival was highly praised, making it one of the few movies to hit Netflix that I was actually looking forward to.The opening scene was done really well, one of those 'Up'-esc sad openings, with Amy Adams as Louise, watching her daughter grow up and then die of cancer.Now in the present (or past) day, Louise is a language teacher, and we learn that the Earth has been invaded by aliens. We learn this by a series of news shows which were mixed to have very quiet, almost inaudible sound. Not for dramatic tension but so that the filmmaker could try to startle you by suddenly having a loud blaring horn go off.The next half hour of the movie felt like it was being obnoxiously slow, as if to build atmosphere or something. They clearly did not learn from the failures of such films as the first Star Trek movie, that slow sci-fi is only superior in being more boring.The aliens begin to come into view through a haze and they suddenly cut away from it as if taking pride in being its cinematic cockteasery.The moment it cuts directly to is directly after the encounter - skipping over it, surely to beg the question 'what happened'? and leading us to suspect that we will find out why everyone looks so shocked at a more dramatic time albeit in a less suspenseful way.But instead the story just continues on. To me this took away some of the drama because all of the people acting traumatized by this experience were not behaving in a way I could relate to considering that the film is assuming that they experienced pretty much exactly what the audience did.The next scene was a bit of a head-scratcher for me too... Having not been able to begin a verbal dialogue with the aliens, Louise decides that the next logical step is to have what she calls a 'visual aid' by showing it the written word 'Human'. To me, she as a human being would be a better 'visual aid' than the written word. But I guess I was wrong because this prompts the alien to start creating text of its own. How stupid must all these smart people have felt when all they had to do was show the aliens an English word they had no way of understanding.Now that they have finally opened the lines of communication, this logically leads to the Colonel being angry at Louise for reasons that don't really make sense, but it allows her to go on a speech about kangaroos.The scenes that follow are somewhat interesting as they try to learn to communicate, but it gets old pretty fast; it reminded me of the Legend of Graystoke and being bored to tears with watching Tarzan learn English. I wanted to see him swinging through trees, and in Arrival - a story about an alien invasion - I wanted to see something actually happen.It becomes very clear that the author has a great interest in language and communication, and in the narration explaining the language the film is at its best. Unfortunately, the film slides into the all too predictable 'race against time' cliché.The aliens send a message that translates to 'weapon' which apparently the Chinese have also learned to decipher - probably written in to add to the race against time, but instead it sort of renders all of the scenes where Louise was learning the language virtually pointless since apparently several others have done the exact same thing.With about half an hour left in the movie I had figured out where the story was going. It's interesting but it probably wouldn't have been as predictable if it wasn't so DAMN SLOW PACED! Suffice it to say there is a kind of odd twist that was another interesting idea, but because of the way they did it, it feels like less of a twist than having the rug pulled out from under us, because there was clearly information that was being sneakily hid from us unnecessarily, leading to the necessary lack of character development.But then comes the worst part yet... something that I'm afraid requires some spoilers...She learns vital information by seeing into the future to a time when she already knew the information. This kind of circular story- telling is one of the laziest kinds!Now I did like the fact that the theme of non-linear time was reinforced by the structure of the film. What I don't like is that the flashes of the future come at seemingly random times and is unclear about what brings them on - nor does it explain how she was suddenly able to phone a Chinese cell phone when we were told that all global communication systems were down.I'm sorry of this is a 'spoiler' but the way they hid the all too obvious revelation of who Hannah's father was was almost insulting.Anyway, the film is an interesting attempt but is in many ways lost potential.",6,10,18,6 August 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," A notch below the Dark Knight
","I went into this film with HUGE expectations. The last time I had huge expectations for a film was The Dark Knight, which exceeded my expectations. The Dark Knight Rises didn't exceed my expectations but certainly met them. So I'm rating this 8 out of ten so you can hopefully get the idea that it is a good film, but it might be more enjoyable if you're not expecting it to be a GREAT film.PLOT - I don't want to spoil anything here, so suffice it to say that it takes a lot of story threads from Batman Begins and expands upon those ideas in some pretty cool ways... so it might not be a bad idea to re-watch Batman Begins as a refresher. I should also mention that the tone is not as dark as The Dark Knight, so it's more 'family friendly' in my eyes.BATMAN - Bale's raspy voice was far less obnoxious in this film than the previous ones. I'm not sure if he toned it down a bit or if there was just less dialogue but either way, it was an improvement on the previous films. In this movie they show Batman/Bruce Wayne as a superhero who is past his prime, and in many ways broken down, which I found to be an interesting approach.BANE - Once again the villain steals the show. As with The Dark Knight, not a lot of back-story is provided; just enough to whet your appetite.CATWOMAN - I always find myself questioning Nolan's casting choices, but then after seeing the film I realize how right he was in his decisions. This was again the case with Anne Hathaway. To be honest I'm not usually a fan of butt-kicking women because it usually feels really fake, but they pulled it off well here.ALFRED - I've always liked Michael Caine, but not so much in this film. I found his accent was a little different at times, he was always weepy and whinging, and in some ways seemed to be saying things completely opposite to his views in the previous films. This might have been to show an old man's reflection on his past mistakes, but at points I'll admit I thought maybe he was just losing his marbles.The Dark Knight Rises concludes the Batman series quite nicely but also leaves open the possibility for spin-offs. To be honest, I'd rather they just left it alone, the only way my mind might be changed is if Christopher Nolan were to direct any such films, but I have a feeling that won't happen.My overall feeling is that it is just a notch below The Dark Knight, which is still very good! It is a little bit long and even a little slow at certain points, but that is just Nolan lulling you into a sense of security before awing you with some intense action.",8,1,3,21 July 2012
The Hangover Part III," Glad I got to see this film in the cinema
","My rating of 8/10 was a bit generous, but my thinking was that in my small way I want to off-set all the negative reviews.It might have been a benefit to have gone into the film with low expectations, but in the end it was a funny film and I'm glad I went to see it.First off, the format is different from the first two films, it's a much more linear time line. The second major difference is that Mr. Chow plays a much larger role in this one (which was a positive thing from my perspective).The premise of this film is that some of the events from the first film -- the drug mix up, as well as Alan's on-going relationship with Mr. Chow has a crime boss using them to get to Chow. To be honest, it seemed a little bit contrived, but they made it work pretty well (unlike such debacles as the Scream movies).Chow perhaps has the greatest character arch, although Alan is more the focal point of the film. One of the things they seemed to bring out more in this film was the animosity between Alan and Stuart, which made for some enjoyable bickering.I have to say that I'm glad I got to see this film in the cinema. For a film that could easily be seen as a 'buddy flick', or a rental it actually had some moments that were really enjoyable in the theatre due to the scope of it. Specifically a sequence on the roof of Caeser's palace with some well choreographed and filmed vertigo-inducing moments.It's hard for me to compare this to the first two films because I enjoyed both, and having gone in with low expectations, they were exceeded. So all I will leave you with, is that if the humour of the other movies appeals to you, I'm certain you will have an enjoyable time at this movie.",8,1,2,6 June 2013
