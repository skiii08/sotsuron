Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Stay at home
","This is an absolute dogs  dinner of a film, a complete waste of time.A Tarrentino movie was something I looked forward to.This film is so slow to start you will be nodding off long before the end. I guess after a while you believe your own publicity and become infatuated with your own ego, someone close to Quentin should tell him to get back to making  movies like Dogs or Pulp, in short a massive disapointment.Asad waste of the talents involved. score minus 10. The cinema   I saw this in was only one third full an indication that Quentin is loosing his fan base, he will end up writing scripts for tv programmes any more dirge like this is made.Hopefully his next movie will get him back on track but Kill Bill vol 2 is a stinker.",Null,2,3,24 April 2004
Ali," only average
","Iwas disapointed with this film,take away the fight scenes and theres not a lot left.Ali was a genius but you would never guess it from this film,biopics should only be made when their subject is dead,not enough fizz in this film,not one I would watch again.",Null,0,0,27 February 2002
Spartacus," inspiring fight for freedom
","This movie is based on the DVD produced by criterion.The title sequence is unique,the face of a Roman warrior smashed to pieces,a symbol for Spartacus or the Roman empire?The first hour deals with Spartacus gaining his battling skills at the gladiator school and then the revolt of the slaves.The training scenes are very well filmed ,the dialogue is sparse but very effective,it shows how demanding a life of a gladiator was.The burgening romance of Spartacus and Varina is touching helped by some marvellous love theme.The film has a stellar cast including Kirk Douglas,Jean Simmons,Charles Laughton,Peter Ustinov and Tony Curtis.The Romans are shown as cold ruthless and politically ambitous.There are several scenes that stand out,Spartacus fight with Draba,Charles Laughton in the senate,the revolt of the gladiators,the battle scenes,the identification of Spartacus and the farewell at the end.Ustinov won the Oscar for his role and Woody Strode is memorable as Draba.Often called the thinking mans epic,a film that is fresh today.The extras on the DVD include dek leted scenes,a documentary on the Hollywood ten and a couple of interesting commentries.There was a sequel of sorts called the son of Spartacus starring Steve Reeves which never seems to be shown on TV.Spartacus is a film to catch up with if you have not seen it, or a rewatch if you haven,t seen it for awhile.",8,1,2,19 May 2010
Hostel," cinematic freedom requires cinematic responsibility
","The magic of the movies is lost forever, after this movie, the same medium that brought us Fred Astaire dancing , so gracefully as now produced this mess.At best movies can take the human condition and say something important, sadly Hostel does nothing of the kind ,we are spared no gruesome detail of mans inhumanity to man.There is a story of sorts that you can quite easily pick to pieces, there's no real good guy to root for just someone who is less marginally unpleasant than everyone else.The torture scenes are horrific, staunch churning to say the least.Movie directors such as John Ford or Hitchcock could hold an audience's attention by telling us a story about people we cared for, and building up suspense by not showing us everything.I don't object to violence when its making a necessary point and is in context with the subject matter as in Saving Private Ryan but this is an orgy of torture and is the product of a sick mind.The saddest part of all is that some people on this site say its the best film they have ever seen, I can only take that as meaning Hostel is the only movie they have seen",3,1,1,4 November 2006
A Bridge Too Far," war epic
","A bridge too far is essential viewing for those who love war films, it is intelligent, well written and well acted.Arnhem was a disaster for the allies, though Montgomery regarded it as a limited success, however the dignity of the soldiers fighting for their cause shines through.The Germans are shown as human beings and not cardboard cut outs.The film contains several great scenes the ones that stand out to me are the landing all the parachutes,the river crossing, the dropping of supplies, the house taken over as a hospital and the wounded soldiers singing abide with me.The stars all perform very well with Connery and Hopkins outstanding.The soundtrack is excellent, with a tune you can whistle to.The special edition of the DVD is excellent with some great extras, i recommend this film to everyone interested in world war 2",9,2,4,7 December 2005
We Were Soldiers," we all knew it could happen
","This a very good movie a slow build up as characters are developed.The story moves along rapidly when the battle starts.Its a non stop ride full of blood and guts,the film shows the viet cong in their tunnels and humanizes them to a certain degree.The news of the death of the troops is brought home with tragic consequences and it is very moving.The film as been compared to The Green Berets which is one of my favourites this film has heart and makes it points patriotically. 7.5/10",Null,0,1,12 March 2002
The Best Years of Our Lives," Homer,Wilma and a box of tissues
","Possible spoilers This film, carries an emotional whack,parts of the film maybe dated but its worth watching because the parts that do work,work splendidly.I never fought a war in my life I am so lucky,you see Homer and you realise in history books war finished in 1945 but for Homer he has to live for ever with the consequencs. A film with heart not sentimentality,the scene were Homer and Wilma decide to get married is beautiful,happy and sad at the same time I cried.All the cast is good and the film has its amusing moments too,just watch and have the tissues ready.8/10",Null,1,2,4 October 2002
American History X," racism and redemption possible spoilers
","This film shocked me.its violence was truly sickening in fact one scene is the most uncomfortable I have witnessed.The premise of the film is that racist  can change, for all our sakes I hope they can.  A man from the darkside of life ,through pain and time changes and tries to put right the wrongs he has done.This id difficult and it carries a huge price, a film that asks questions and leaves  the viewer stunned.Well acted its a film for adults or serious youths my marks 8/10",Null,0,0,13 October 2003
Gone with the Wind," DVD enhances a classic
","This movie is a true classic, the first half of this film is as good as movie making gets, from any era, the second half may tail off a little bit with melodramatic moments ,but you can easily forgive this film for that after such an exhilarating first 3 hours.The true test of a classic film is could any other actors have done better in the roles and in truth no one else could.Vivien Leigh is supberb as Scarlet who you feel both anger and joy at her reactions, well Gable is Gable and is excellent.Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard flesh out the secondary leads, I hope black people can accept that there roles as servants were not intended to demean anyone but to show how things were.Hattie McDaniels is excellent and deserves her Oscar.The DVD is excellent please go out and buy.To sum up a great film and a great DVD, please find the time to watch it again.",9,6,8,6 February 2006
Zulu," simply marvellous
","Afilm that has stood the test of time.The thin red line,standing firm against overwhelming odds.Awar movie set at the peak of the British empire.The film starts with scenes of a beaten British army at Isandhlwana then tells the story of the heroic battle of Rorke's drift.The soldiers at the drift here the news that the Zulu's are on the way to attack them,whilst preparations for the defence of the drift gather pace,we are introduced to various characters.The tension builds up nicely,especially with the noise of the Zulus getting closer and closer.The British class system raises its head along with internal politics all of which is done entertainingly.The heroes include Stanley Baker as the working class hero in charge of the drift,Michael Caine as the upper class toff who finds his true character in battle,James Booth the anti hero.The cast is good with two very good performance from Nigel Green and Patrick Magee, TV viewers will spot a few faces who made it on various programmes.The only disappointment is the Jack Hawkins character,although based on a real person just doesn't seem to belong to this film.The film empathises,s the physical effects of battle and treats the Zulus fairly.The film is criticised for not being accurate but at the end of the day its an entertainment not a documentary",9,6,9,22 May 2010
Saving Private Ryan," awesome twenty minutes
","The first twenty minutes are some of the most remarkable scenes ever filmed,the violence and brutality is shocking and believable.The rest of the movie cannot live up to this,but it holds your attention.The acting is good.The only weak part is soldiers talking about the meaning of life late one night. Afitting tribute to those who sacrificed their youth for freedom. 8/10",Null,0,0,24 June 2002
Lawrence of Arabia," Enigma in the desert
","The film based on T E Lawrence book the seven pillars of wisdom,directed by David Lean,takes epic cinema to a new high seldom matched and not beaten yet.The cinematography is superb,you feel like you are transported back in time to 1917 in the Arabuian desert.Peter O toole is excellent in the lead role,in all my years watching the movie I've got to say this is the near perfect cast.Alec Guiness as the arab prince,calm,cool and calculating,Claude Raines,as a diplomat,Arthur Kennedy at his very best as a newspaper man who creates the mtyh Lawrence of Arabia.Anthony Quinn is outstanding as the the arab leader Audu and Jack Hawkins is good as Allenby.The scenes that stand out are the introduction of Omar Shariff in the simmering desert,the attack on Aquaba,the searing heat of the desert,the massacre of Turkish troops,there are lots of great scenes for the discerning viewer to watch again and a again.The film was cut for running time soon after its premiere,but was added years later and this is the version to watch.The film influenced Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorrsse.This film needs to be watched on the biggest TV available,a treat for the eyes and the brain.",9,0,1,25 May 2010
The Longest Day," an overview of D day
","This film is sometimes compared to saving private ryan which is unfair as spr is essentially only concerned with D day in the first 20 minutes.This movie gives a total picture of the event,that was truly a massive hitorical event,no expense was spared on locations or cast.The film works as a war movie and also spot the movie stars its also good seeing movie legends Wayne,Fonda and Mitchum in action.Wayne is good as a tough commander,Fonda is steady as a general who wants to go even though he is in agony in arthritis,but Mitchum takes the prize as the commander who organises the men at Omaha beach,with a cigar in the mouth. I would like to point out that there is a character called John Miller a sgt played by Jeff Hunter,in spr Tom Hanks plays a character with the same name,coincidence perhaps? This film is not about gloryfying war it shows how difficult the D day event was and how we owe our freedom to heroics of the fighting man. The DVD is good, however I do think an opportunity has been missed, i think a documentary or commentart from surviving members of the cast would be useful, alos some veterans comments, and possibly a film historian",9,1,1,26 June 2002
From Dusk Till Dawn," dreadful movie
","This film is simply appalling, how the talent involved made this is beyond human belief.Iguess they must have been boozing when they thought of this idea,I feel as if 2 hours of my life have been taken from me.Harvey Kietel will try and distance himself from this rubbish, it should have been a great crime movie but it develops into a gory mess of vampires.I would recommend this film to people who like to sleep through movies ,you wont miss a thing.The humour is set to appeal to the lowest common dominate, movies can uplift us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just depresses you.As DeNiro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is wasted talent this film is a perfect example of this statement.",1,24,46,12 February 2006
Green Street Hooligans," best yet on a difficult subject to film
","This film tries to get into the shady world of football hooliganism, the film surprisingly succeeds very well.The main character an American played by Elijah Wood is introduced to a new world of violence by his brother in law.This world is full of guys who drink in pubs dedicated to their own teams, each of which is submerged in its own culture and all have their own songs about the clubs they support with a passion.The passion comes through really well i have been in many pubs where spontaneous singing and chanting break out, however i have never been involved in violence .The violence in this film is realistic and definitely for an adult audience, the people involved in the fights are incredibly loyal to each other and have a pecking order, and it seems the most important quality they have is a bond between them, its just a pity that they behave so negatively.A side issue is that these guys are incredibly normal for most of the week, one of the main hooligans teaches children which considering the philosophy of violence he believes in is quite shocking.It must be stressed that hooligans are a small part of English football but the problem has not gone away.",7,1,3,6 December 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," classic
","A fantastic film , that holds the attention, we are transported back and forwards in time, to a world were loyalty appears to be everything but personal ambition destroys the friendship.This film is visually stunning being brutal and beautiful at the same time, there are two rape scenes which are still shocking, the second after one of the most romantic scenes ever in movies.The violence is often bloody for these are violent men let down by the system they live in their own world and make their own rules.The film is slow and patience is required to Vi it, the length of the film is such that it needs an effort to find the time to watch but each time you watch it, your looking forward to viewing it again.The direction is excellent Sergios lasting legacy, the acting is out of this world DeNiro has never been better and James Wood is fantastic.The DVD has some interesting extras though i would have liked more, i believe there was 9 hours on film of this movie, Sergio was a genius I wished he had lived long enough for another two movies.",9,6,12,28 November 2005
A Clockwork Orange," big issues tackled
","Well I saw this movie in 1971 it was the most controversial of its time,it tackles big issues like youth crime,freedom ,vengenance and disenchantment with society.The film is too long a good thirty minutes could and should have been cut.The rape scene was very disturbing and it worries me some thug may try to copy it.However the film does make you think about issues so thats a bonus,but its not an easy film to watch and it is dated.The film was banned in several places in the Uk but now its violence the rape scene apart is not as shocking or bloody as it could have been,so if you haven't seen it watch it but its a hard slog. 6/10",Null,1,2,14 October 2002
Titanic," Supreme blockbuster
","Titanic delivers,on that there is no doubt,its a supreme blockbuster,the acting is good and the script fairly good.Its the classic boy meets girl story on the doomed voyage,it has been unfairly riticised for not having a documentry approach but if you want that try the splendid A night to remember. The main characters are well developed,personally I would like a bit more sub plot,but because Rose and Jack become real people it makes the story so much more moving.The last hour is simply breathtaking and one asks the question of one self how would I behave in that situation.So watch this film in April every year and thank God you weren't there. 8/10",Null,2,3,8 April 2002
Die Hard," A modern classic
","A film that was so succesful it has been copied by everyone but none get near this roller coaster of a ride.Bruce is made for this his one liners are really good and he's still a human being not a super human like Arnie or Sly.The relationship between Al and John Maclane is well developed and your rooting for them in the film. The journalist is a scheming ambitous sort of person who gets his comeuppence at the end,The FBI men are so gun ho and they add to the fun.However the star of the film is without doubt Alan Rickman just being the worst villain in blockbuster history. This is a hollywood blockbuster that delivers thrills and spills watch and enjoyl. 8/10",Null,1,1,4 March 2002
War of the Worlds," Cecil B Demille meet your successor Steven
","This is a marvellous blockbuster, it delivers thrills and spills it fills the screen with excitement.In the big movie house in the sky Cecil will look down and see that Steven has delivered a Demille style movie,This film may have its distractors but I think it will be shown on TV and duds for years to come, though I am glad I went to movies to see it.There are scenes in it that stay with you a long time, the ferry scene was just awesome, the first alien coming out the ground was fantastic.The sound at times is deafening, but its a memorable experience.Some people say they are disappointed but what do they want from a blockbuster, the acting is up to the standard the movie requires, and the key scene for me was when Ray and his son parted company both had accepted that they had love and respect for each other.So I think you should treat yourself and go and enjoy this movie.Cecil would have loved it.",10,0,2,18 July 2005
To Kill a Mockingbird," atmospheric
","I must first of all admit I've never read the book.This film is enchanting filmed in monochrome it has bundles of atmosphere,a well written script and is soperbly acted. Set in the deep south in 1932 we veiw the world from the eyes of Scout and Jim they are innocents amidst the bigotry that existed then and sadly does today. Peck plays Atticus a lawyer with a humane approach towards the negroes,asked by the judge to defend Tom Robinson on a rape charge he does so with great dignity.The court room scenes are dramatic and moving,the outcome of the movie is satisfying too. I would like to see such intelligent movie making today ,special effects will never replace a good story,so make a yourself a coffe grab some biscuits and have a cinematic treat. 9/10",Null,0,0,1 March 2002
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Classic war movie
","The first of the epics from David Lean,this is a classic war movie.However I must point out it is not historically about the building of the Burma railway,but uses that situation to portray the madness of war.The opening scene of down trodden British troops marching into camp whistling Colonel Bogey is absolutely marvellous.The Japanese culture doesn't recognise the Geneva Convention,Alec Guiness plays an English officer who refuses to bend to the rules of the camp commandant,and ends up in the cooler.William Holden is excellent as the cynical American,who escapes only to have to return later on.Jack Hawkins is a dedicated officer who leads a raid to destroy the bridge.The film throws up dilemmas and irony through out,the ending is classic cinema.The film was not an easy shoot according to Kevin Brownlow's biography of David Lean,it was the director against everyone else.Well the in fighting was wort it,a film you can watch again and again.The three leads are excellent,as is Sessue as the Japanese commander.The ending stays with you.Sadly younger audiences will not stick with it,a shame,but rewarding to the discerning film fan.",9,0,1,27 June 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," stand out movie from 1975
","This film has no special effects,it has something much better a story great script and acting from the top draw.Jack and Louise are outstanding and the rest of the cast do their jobs well.The film is extremely well written and can be enjoyed on different levels,as a story well told and as comment on the USA of the  Nixon era.The nurse represents Nixon and MacMurphy the anti vietnam movement and freedom from a system that has no room for individuals,if only todays movies were so good.9/10",Null,0,1,8 July 2002
Ben-Hur," a remake please
","A fine film for its day ,sadly its starting to show its age.The script and pace of the film seem awfully slow compared to modern movies.The succes of Gladiator proves there is a market out there for epics and with todays effects the film could be awsome.A remake could make history by being the first remake of a remake to win the best picture oscar. I would like the guy who did the lord of the rings to direct it,Guy Pearce to be Ben-HUR and Russell Crowe as Messala.So come om hollywood get remaking it now. 6/10 age showing",Null,0,3,5 March 2002
The Deer Hunter," Well Acted but flawed movie
","This movie is extremley well acted but it is awfully slow,the first hour puts years on you,I liked the bar scene when they are playing pool,then the pace stops. The vietnam scenes are gripping enough and truly horrific images of war appear on screens and the secoind half of the film is better than the first.Cimmino was lucky with this film he is not a good director,this film is a good hour too long,I guess this film is more popular in the USA than the UK. Watch it but probably have a break because its a slow slow movie 9/10 for acting 2/10 for direction the first hour is a gift for insomniacs  zzzzzzz",6,0,0,18 April 2002
The Great Escape," Great Movie
","This film does take a few libertys with facts, there were no Americans involved in the escape, though some helped plan it, and where transferred to another camp at the last moment.This film though is about heroes and the spirit of freedom.T he film belongs to McQueen who is just fantastic to watch the camera loved him and I believe one day he will jump that fence.The rest of the cast are particurlarly good, the scene where the forger is told he can't escape is moving especially when James Garner volunteers to look after him.The James Garner character is roll model for me I  always try to scrounge things.Simply watch and enjoy a truly great movie you will laugh and then feel down. I give this movie 8/10",Null,14,18,30 December 2003
The Great Escape," A classic
","As long as people watch movies they will watch this one.Based on a true story,however a few facts are changed for dramatic effect.The music is brilliant and the actors play their parts well.The film looks great on DVD and the extras are really good,Plenty of laughs and thrills and some moments that make you have a lump in the throat and a tear in the eye forms.Watch this and enjoy the star quality of McQUEEN and Garner the rest of the cast are great. Think of the 50 at the end and weep.",Null,2,4,23 May 2002
