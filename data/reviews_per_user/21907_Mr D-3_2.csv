Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Bravo George, you've done it again!!!
",I thoroughly enjoyed the PM.  It told enough to answer a few questions from the middle three and gave us enough to think about for the next two.  The only real problem is...how many days to the next one!,10,0,0,27 June 1999
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Wow.
",Several times during this movie I wanted to stand and cheer. Just as many times I sat there spellbound as to what the Dragon/Tiger team did with this movie.  The stunts were phenomenal without being too hollywoodish.  It added an element of mystique and spiritualism to the entire experience as opposed to an effect to just have an effect. Some viewers may be scared off by the subtitles but they seemed to add to the movie rather than distract me.  Two huge thumbs up from me and if I can add....WOW.,10,0,0,27 December 2000
