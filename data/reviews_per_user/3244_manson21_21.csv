Insomnia," A good film
",Insomnia is a great film to watch and really had a good night watching it and love Al Pacino films but this must go up with his best films he has done along with godfather saga and scarface. I don't want to spoil what this film is about for other people so i will not say much about this film but it felt like it had suspence in the film. Robin Willams was nice to see his darkside and good acting from him  and i really want to watch one hour photo when its on video. give this film 9/10,Null,0,0,14 March 2003

Sleepy Hollow," 3 words Dark gothic mystery
",Sleepy Hollow is a enjoyable gothic film about a headless horseman who wakes from the dead who like to chop people's heads off and this man Johnny depp who been sent from new york to sleepy hollow to investegate these killings but some how it reminds me of Jack The Ripper. Its a good mystery gothic film up to where the windmill is and it went down hill abit for me and its a shame not to see christopher lee more in this film. I am going to give this film 8/10Think everyone should go and watch this film,Null,1,1,21 May 2003
The Bourne Identity," What a rush
",I really had so much fun watching the Bourne Identity but mind its not a classic but well worth watching. Thought its abit daft when Mr Bourne was floting in the sea at the start of the film in real life we would of been dead in that time of season. Good acting had a good story nice plot to the film and can't forget the mini car chase in paris and the music to it just so cool. I am giving this film 7/10,Null,0,1,13 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I like saruman he is the best from the lord of the rings films
",I 1st watched Lord Of The Ring The Fellowship Of The Ring at the cinema but i thought northing much to the film but last night i watched it again on video and i did see the two towers at the cinema along with my brothers and i like it alot then i rewatched the fellowship and it fit those pieces in and i loved it and i can't wait for the return of the king. Not going to write about the film in case no one has watched it yet but sure are some good speical effect great cast peter jackson did a really good job except for one scene i did not like tell you why i think it was sean bean who took 3 bow arrows to kill him and still alive but in Mel Gibson Braveheart only took 1 bow arrow to kill a man so to me peter jackson made abit of a bulls up in that scene.To me christopher lee was the best in the film playing sarumanGood fantasy film hard to decide between lord of the rings and harry potter but i am giving this film 9/10,Null,0,0,2 May 2003
Cast Away," some what a good movie

The Thing," I can't understand why it flop at the cinema
",I really loved this film so much The Thing is the best horror film that john carpenter has done along with Halloween and The Fog. Not going to say alot about the plot in case people have not seen the film yet but let me say this is just about the best horror paranoia film you can ever get in movie history. The special effect are so good it holds up todays speical effect even better and that was done in 1982. John Carpenter films today are not very good vampire and ghost of mars was rubbish and wish he goes back to his roots.Give this film 10/10,Null,0,1,27 March 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Not bad at all but not a classic
",I am a fan of Terminator the acting is ok the plot is ok but really it felt like something was missing from this film.The 1st one was way much better guess can't really see Arnold playing a good guy after playing a bad guy in the 1st one. But anyway special effect are good still holds up today effect but in my mind Terminator 1 is the best and give this film a 7/10Also heard going to be Terminator 3 rise of the machine i think they should not of done that and just keep it at Terminator 1 and 2,Null,1,2,22 December 2002
Resident Evil," I was hoping more from this film
",You call this a horror film more like action film there was little gore not even scary the acting was not great and i was disapointed oh well what do you expect from video game to movie. Don't get me wrong i love the Resident Evil games just not the movie and really do hope Resident Evil Nemesis is better then this. Giving this film 3/10,Null,0,0,3 March 2003
28 Days Later...," British saves the world again
",I saw 28days later at the cinema then just watched it last night on DVD and this film is not a rip off from Resident Evil or any zombie films well i would not call 28days later a zombie film but more like a virus what wipe out the whole world and that British people are trying to survive from this virus called rage.Really good horror film good acting from a unknown cast beside christapher he is a good actor good plot and best film from last year then the not so good films like spider-man austin powers 3 my big fat greak wedding.Looks like the British will have to build the world again8/10,Null,0,0,25 May 2003
8 Mile," Its alright i suppose
",I was not really to keen to watch 8 mile but my brother a big Eminem fan and i was took along to watch it with him i am not a Eminem fan don't really like his music at all. But the movie was alright acting is good plot was ok northing speical and i suppose this film is about his life and how we was to get where he is. I would love to see Marilyn Manson do a film about his life and how he got to be where he is that would be cool mybe if that was true could even be better then 8 mile never know. Only thing i find bad about this film is the soundtrack its rubbish no class in it sometimes wish could change the music did my head in. Anyway giving this film 5/10 evens.,Null,0,0,2 February 2003
A Clockwork Orange," A good film

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," ITS NOT SORCERER'S STONE ITS A PHILOSOPHER'S STONE
",Harry Potter and the philosopher's stone is a great family film to watched on a sunday afternoon when having your lunch. I have never read any of the books and i only heard about harry potter when it came out at the cinema but i never did went but just watched it on DVD and its a really good film enjoyed alot. Great fantasy little bit better then lord of the rings and its really good to see full cast of fine BRITISH actors and not having to put up with american accent like in spider-man that was also RUBBISH. Little bit disappointed that not seeing any BRITISH FLAGS in the film like the american do glot there flag around in films. Loved the quiddish match its kinda like a football game but diffrent anyway this is an excellent film with good special effects.Give this film 9/10,Null,0,0,20 April 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," I was blown away with the special effects
",The Matrix Reloaded has got to be the best film of 2003 and i take my hat off to the wachowski brothers and the speical effects was the best i have ever seen and can't wait to buy this film on DVD. There where some scene i did not like in the film the tribal dance and the sex scene to me they don't match in a si fi film but i do somehow still find the original matrix a little better it had a more of a story to it then the Matrix Reloaded. I just wonder something just now with the matrix about humans computers and robots fighting each other and in the next few months we have Terminator 3 just wonder if its a head to head clash who can make the most money?? what they did with Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings what do you people think Terminator or The Matrix what do you think is better.??? I am giving this film 8/10 and anyway i loved this film,Null,0,0,22 May 2003
Halloween," A must see film
",This comment might have spoilersHalloween is a classic film and must be seen for any horror buff i just finnish watching halloween on DVD and its never gets boring. What i can't understand is why Halloween is not in the imdb top 250 and seen much worser films in there. I think they should stop making halloween sequels i am such a big fan of micheal mayes but really should stop more films they do its gets really silly and boring. Just watch the new halloween at the cinema O boy it was just how can i put it RUBBISH should of stop it at halloween 2Giving this film 9/10,9,0,0,29 December 2002

A Nightmare on Elm Street," Freddy Krueger at his best
","A Nightmare On Elm Street is a classic film and should be watched by everyone who is a horror buff. Well i watched it last night and loved it the film is about a demon killer who kills young men and women in there dreams but end up being killed in real life. I love the scene where tina is running from freddy and he chopped his finger and then the bedroom scene that was so cool. Heather Langenkamp did very well in her role as nancy who finds out in the end how to beat freddy krueger and like her trap she set up to hurt freddy. I thought it was funny that her friend who is played by jonny depp met his death when freddy pull him down in his bed and a rush off blood, how bloody can you get??
