Saturday Night Fever," A MUST SEE FOR THE FAMILY!
","Without a shadow of a doubt, Saturday Night Fever is undoubtly the greatest movie ever filmed in New York. The Disco era was an amazing past time with the illest styles. I lived in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn where Saturday Night Fever was filmed, for 18 years and that film was portrayed perfectly. The 'Brooklyn Guidos' were played so true it was funny. And all the night clubs and the views of the Verezano Bridge brought back memories. The question is, when will this be on DVD? Hopefully for the 25th Anniversary! (Which is 2002)A true walk down memory lane....1 Love Joey Minchia, Brooklyn",Null,0,0,11 June 2001
