Frost_Nixon," Ron Howard? Oh yeah, he makes pretty good films.
","What negative things can we say about Ron Howard? He narrated Arrested Development, he starred in Happy Days, he has Clint Howard as a brother, and he always makes good, solid and entertaining films. As such is the case with his latest biopic- Frost/Nixon. It treads mostly on requisite Howard ground, and some people might say this is just another 'Oscar Bait' film filled with Oscar Bait-ish principles. But you know what? Most of those people forgot that the film is actually pretty damn good.The film basically follows the famous Frost and Nixon interview in the late 70's; what happened in and outside of said event. We get to see the overall preparation of the interview, the comedy bits between Rockwell and Oliver Platt (James Reston Jr and Bob Zelnick respectively), the drama involving David Frost and his near-impossible challenge, his love interest, Kevin Bacon insulting Frost's shoes, a drunk Nixon talking about cheeseburgers, and the third act which can be summed up as- a happy ending. All shot of course in stylized cinematography and editing, with gorgeous production design backing everything up. Now, there is a lot of hype with this film, and the reason isn't because of Michael Sheen.Sad to say that while Sheen does admirably in most scenes, he is nothing compared to the towering performance of Frank Langella as Nixon. Hell, I thought it was going to be something resembling a parody; an over-hyped, average performance, just like George Clooney in Syriana, or Sandra Bullock in Erin Brokovich. And yes, ladies and gentleman, I WAS VERY F*CKING WRONG.I underestimated Langella, which has proved himself better than Anthony Hopkins in my eyes. Because it isn't just about looking like Nixon, it is about emulating him and all of his subtle emotions, expressions, you name it. Langella nails it with intense precision and 'no-holds barred' aggression that I quite simply felt just like Sheen in the film- awe-struck. Which makes me wonder if Sheen was really awe-struck in his scenes with Langella...In other news, the rest of the acting was efficient. Rockwell and Platt did their usual characters, Bacon was a no-nonsense military officer, and Rebecca Hall looked pretty. I think Howard didn't really bother with the other characters; I think he knew from the get-go that this was a going to be vehicle movie for Langella. Meh, I don't blame him.The result of the equation is an 8.2 out of 10. But WAY?!, you may ask. Well, this film felt just like any other Howard Drama (there will be no surprises here), but the difference being that the supportive acting wasn't as memorable or as good as said Drama's. But what we get to see though, is one of the best performances of the year by Frank Langella, and that in itself is reason for admission.8.2/10",8,1,5,12 December 2008
Revolutionary Road," Unhappy Marriage: The Movie
","Revolutionary Road is Sam Mendes fourth (or fifth?) film, and as you can expect, the film looks visually exquisite. But I'm not going to start talking about cinematography here. I'm going to start talking about how Revolutionary Road is Sam's weakest film. The praise and hate the movie is receiving puzzles me. For starters, Revolutionary Road is a movie that depends on performances, not story or script; What you mostly see for almost 2 hours is two good looking people duking it out over their unhappiness, their wasted lives, their BORING lives, the chances they missed and wished they had, etcetera, etcetera. It is definitely not a movie for everyone, but that doesn't mean that you have to 'get' the movie in order to hype it up for everyone else. As I said, the movie is about performances, nothing more, nothing less.Two young people fall in love one night, get married, have children, and start to question if they really love each other. The premise of Revolutionary Road is based on a novel that I have no intention of reading, let alone comparing to the movie. Between infidelities and broken dreams, it is all about the 'realistic' aspect of the marriage between Leo and Kate, which is why I guess many people love this one. On the other hand, we have the requisite over-blown dramatic sequences which apparently turned off most of the professional critics and commenter's here in IMDb. I am in the middle.I appreciate Sam's extreme attention and detail to the ups and downs of marriage, but what I don't appreciate is the little things in between. For some reason, we have Michael Shannon telling Leo and Kate the reality of the situation IN THEIR FACE, in order for them to understand what is really going on. Then we have an unnecessary love issue between the Wheeler's neighbor with Kate that goes on as subtle as Pink Floyd giving a free concert in Times Square. And an ending that teaches us that marriage is not what the magazines make you believe it is. Or the American Dream ads for that matter. After Jarhead, I really don't understand why Sam wanted to tackle this project in the first place. The script is incredibly simple, and it isn't as great as many people here are making you believe it is. What enhances the script, and the movie, are the performances, which are first-rate. I hate repeating myself, but it is the case I'm afraid.Kate Winslet is the talk of town this year, and I can see why, at least in this movie. Her performance as bored and depressed April Wheeler is fantastic on almost all accounts. But as fantastic as Kate was, it was Leo who definitely made me turn my head. He completely stole Kate's thunder, COMPLETELY. And in Leo's quieter moments is where he shines the most. Why the hell did he get snubbed? What the hell are the Academy smoking? I mean, is it really that hard to nominate a great performance? Jeez. The supporting cast is forgettable except for of course Michael Shannon. Out of the four scenes he was in, he stole all four of them. Who the hell is Michael Shannon? Quite possibly one of the most underrated actors working today, who alongside Ryan Gosling will definitely go places in the near future. Thank the gods he has a much deserved nomination.Revolutionary Road is like some of the movies released this year (Gran Torino, Seven Pounds)- loved by many people, hated by many critics. As a big fan of Sam Mendes, this was sort of let down. The script wasn't anything special, and the movie is basically there for you to see Leo, Kate's and Shannon's performances, which is alright I guess. Far from being a bad movie, but it is also far from being a masterpiece. It is just an above-average watch that you will either love or hate.6.8/10",6,2,4,26 January 2009
Gran Torino," Clint Eastwood singing like a badass.
","I will try to be as unbiased as I possibly can because Clint Eastwood is one of my personal heroes and quite frankly, it is impossible for me to hate any of his films, acting, singing, anything really. I haven't seen Changeling yet, but I have seen Gran Torino and let me tell you, it packs quite the punch. What Unforgiven was his to his career in Westerns, Gran Torino is his swan song to the Dirty Harry persona and perhaps his Acting career overall. The National Board of Review saw it fit to award Clint in the Best Actor category a while back. While I'm not complaining, let me just say straight off the bat that Million Dollar Baby was his best performance. Gran Torino comes second. OK then.As most of you know, Gran Torino presents a 'what-if' scenario- What if Dirty Harry was old and lived in a neighborhood crawling with dumbass gang members? But it isn't just that, because Clint manages to do a coming of age story as well. After his wife dies, an Asian family moves next door. It doesn't help with the fact that Clint is a racist living in a town filled with different nationalities (aside from the Asians). So in short, he hates everyone. When Clint mistakenly (or knowingly) saves the next door troubled teenager from being taken by Gang members, everything changes. The film isn't just Clint kicking ass, its about Clint helping and teaching a fatherless, insecure, and lonely kid everything he knows on what it takes to be a 'real man'. You know those movies where the old, disgruntled man has a change of heart and decides to start helping those in need? Same thing here. Now before you kiddies start pressing the 'No' button, feel free to learn that the film uses the clichés to its advantage. We've seen it all before, but rarely with this amount of heart, which is of course provided by the amazing performance of Clint and his amazing grasp at directing.Now here's the kicker- you won't see the end coming. As cliché as this film is, the ending will leave you dazed and confused, until you start putting everything in perspective. Its quite powerful the image that Clint creates and it won't leave your mind any time soon. Clint basically carries the film on his shoulders (it is his vehicle after all). I mean what else could I say about his performance that hasn't already been said? It's funny, it's tragic, its menacing and it is funny. Did I mention it was funny? I can't say the same thing for the supporting cast however. Clint pulled a Bresson and decided to hire actors that aren't really actors. Its a shame that the most important role in the film, the role of Thao, was unintentionally funny. He composes himself in some scenes, but the rest just fall apart. Thankfully we have veteran actors like John Lynch pulling everything back together again.Morally, this is as good as it gets. The tale is full of heart and you'll leave the theater happy if you aren't one of those boring, elitist types. And while Gran Torino is a great film, things like bad acting hurt it greatly (even more so than the script). Overall, even with all those mishaps, this is an instant must-see.And please, don't expect the film to be an Unforgiven or a Million Dollar Baby, because it ain't.8.3/10",8,2,6,19 December 2008
The Wrestler," The beauty of subtleness.
","I'm very shocked to learn that The Wrestler wasn't nominated for Best Picture of 08 at the Globes. What the hell were they thinking? They weren't even thinking! I hate to be the one to give more hype to the film, but The Wrestler deserves every bit of praise it is receiving. Darren Aronofsky redefines himself by working on something that is yet again, unexpected, but goes in hand with his other work. In case you haven't noticed, in all of Darren's films, the main character(s) are on the verge of breakdown. What happens before and after doesn't matter, what matters is that Darren likes creating and/or working with individuals that have nothing (but ultimately everything) to lose. Same case with The Wrestler.What moved me in this film is the unprecedented realism of it all, and not just from Mickey, but from everything and everyone in the film. This film feels like something made by Werner Herzog.The realism and honesty of the performances is a sight to cherish. And let me start off by praising Mickey Rourke, who has given here what I believe to be the best performance of 2008. Honest and heartwarming- all hidden under the main character's broken down exterior that isn't afraid of reaching the limit. Mickey's method acting is at full force here, and the fact that his life is so similar to Ram's makes it easier for him to know the character better than anyone; up close and personal. There are so many subtleties and nuances in his performance that deserve being written, but I won't spoil the good stuff. Mickey is accompanied by two very beautiful and talented women who also got snubbed by the Globes- Evan Rachel Wood and Marisa Tomei. As with Mickey, these ladies bring everything to the platter, i.e., they bring the goods, and not just physically (Tomeihrmph). Fantastic acting thanks to the talent at hand and Darren's direction.As with his other films, the performance are those of quality; Darren knows how to work with actors- Ellen Burstyn, Marlon Wayans and Hugh Jackman being prime examples. The visual direction is outstanding, but not in the way you might think. It is outstanding in the realism it presents, not in its flashy editing or cinematography tricks like those in Darren's other films. Also, Darren's longtime friend and collaborator Clint Mansell, created a score (with Slash from G&R) that accompanies the film beautifully and personally. The script is nuanced, but slightly predictable. That being said, this film wasn't trying to reach the stratosphere like other movies out there, it knew what it was and you should expect nothing more from that. A simple story about an aging Wrestler with personal problems that discovers his one true love, and embraces it, despite of its consequences. Most people are missing the subtlety in the Wrestler. Seeing Mickey's face before he jumps off the top rope at the end of the film is one of the many examples. A single image backed up by powerful acting speaks volumes; it doesn't trick you, it tells it like it is. Nothing is thrown at your face here, you just have to find out the meaning for yourself.9.3/10, powerful cinema.",9,2,2,29 December 2008
