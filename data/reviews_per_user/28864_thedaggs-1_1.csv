National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Awesome Movie
",Not too often a movie comes out that makes me want to go right before Christmas but this one was calling me. And I am so glad it did This movie was awesome! Never got bored from the beginning! I love Nics movies- and this one was truly a good one! Intriguing and exciting! I also thought the little touch of humor in the movie was great. First movie I have gone to in a while. This is surely a must-see for old and young. I would go see it again. Can't wait until the DVD comes out. I hope the Page 47 thing has some significent in an upcoming film. But all in all a truly exciting and great movie! Now to wait for Indiana Jones to fly by! We need more exciting movies like these-maybe Mission Impossible IV?,10,5,20,23 December 2007
