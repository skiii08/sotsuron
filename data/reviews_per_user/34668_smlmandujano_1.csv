Sucker Punch," Just what I expected.
","I'm huge fan of Zack Snyder I loved 300 I had mixed feelings with Watchmen(but thats another story) and with Sucker Punch I was really hyped, mainly because of the girls, samurais, Nazi zombies and all that stuff. I didn't expect a complex or even great story but in terms of action its delivers, you wont be disappointed. The action is there, cinematography is great, the CGI is amazing. All the dream sequences are action packed and very rewarding, my favorite fight was the first encounter with the giant samurais. Emily browning is really, really hot as well as the other girls and they make a good job with the 'ok' script they were given to work with.And now the bad things,The big reason the movie is flawed is The story I felt I was watching a bad version of Brazil and Inception I never felt the danger or some kind of tension when the girls are fighting, maybe its not the idea. The characters needed more development. Carla Gugino is wow really bad I almost laughed. I didn't like the soundtrack overall sometimes it works and sometimes not. I don't like how Zack Snyder chooses to make like a music video scene in his movies, mainly because the music is bad.So overall just see it as an action movie and nothing else and you will be pleased but if your are expecting a very good story(Brazil, inception), or great performances you will be very disappointed.",8,3,12,26 March 2011
