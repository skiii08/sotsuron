The King's Speech," Brilliant film. I thoroughly enjoyed it
","It is almost impossible to fault this film. It was everything you need for an enjoyable night out at the cinema. I've seen it twice. I can remember my Mum telling me King George Vl had a speech impediment. I am just old enough to remember hearing him on the radio and, as a small child, thinking the halting way of speaking, was the correct way to make a speech. A small child would think that, as the King would lead the country in how to do things. I remember the conversation in our family when he died, how stress of being King during the war and the unexpected abdication of his brother was blamed for his early demise, rather than his smoking habit. I was rather hoping the 'bugger Bogner' remark, which I heard were George V's last words, to come into the film. I liked the portrayal of the BBC equipment broadcasting all over the former British Empire. Westminster Abbey looked rather empty of tombs and I wondered if Peterborough cathedral might have been used for the filming. I particularly enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, loyally coming out of her comfort zone and into Logan's run-down Harley Street practise to help Bertie with his speech. As a production, I loved the costumes, sets and pace of the film and can only hope there will be more UK films of this standard to look forward to.",10,0,6,7 February 2011
Troy," I saw the end first... now I've seen the whole film
","This film exceeded my expectations. I loved the recreation of Troy, the Greek ships (the thousand that Helen's face is supposed to have launched) and the full armour of the Greeks and the Trojans. I would have liked more at the beginning... Helen escaping Menelaus with Paris... Agamemnon enlisting the help of his neighbouring rulers and their armies. I also wanted to follow Odyssius home... Sean Bean is superb in the film. I would have liked a little more about Aeneas as well. This film could have two sequels. The Odyssey and The Aeneid. I look forward to them. For me, there were a few anomalies in the film. Helen lacked the charisma I expected... she should really have been stunning. I thought the bloke who played Achilles (Brad Pitt) played him a little moody and brutish for a super-hero, but, to be fair that was probably more to do with the film screenplay and direction than his acting. Because of this, I really wanted Hector to win the fight against him and all my sympathies were with the Trojans. I was quite pleased when Paris avenged his brother! Isn't it amazing that this ancient piece of writing is so compelling and well-described that the scenes in the film agreed with my imagination of them?... including the final flight from Troy. This is definitely a watch-again film... but it can continue... because Homer continued it with the Odyssey and Virgil followed the fortunes of Anaeas... these could make another two or three films!",8,1,2,18 January 2010
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A great film beautifully shot
","I really enjoyed this film. Gary Oldman's portrayal of George Smiley was brilliantly enigmatic. I liked the way the characters and locations were introduced verbally by another character and then visually in the film, so it was always clear where the action was taking place and who was in the scene. All the complex threads of the story were followed clearly. I remember trying to follow Tinker, Taylor, Soldier Spy when it was televised in days before video recordings were available and, if you missed an episode, you lost the plot! Not so with this film, which with a strong cast and intelligent filming makes for a completely engaging film. It will keep you guessing and get you trying to work out who the mole is to the very end. It was great to watch and the music was well chosen, complementary and not intrusive, never obscuring the dialogue. It makes a change for a film to challenge you to try to anticipate the twists and turns of the plot. This is definitely a watch-again film and I look forward to seeing more like it.",8,38,71,27 September 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," This film is a joy to watch!
","I enjoyed every minute of The Adventures of Tin Tin. The story in not only fast moving, it's beautifully designed all the way through including the opening graphics. The carefully drawn Herge comic-strip style book has been translated into film perfectly. Tin Tin books, are not just fun to read, they are imaginatively adventurous and carefully designed and drawn. Translating all this so faithfully into CGi 3D and 2D film format is a brilliant achievement. I didn't want it to end. We watched it in 2D, as we all have slightly imperfect eyesight and find watching an entire feature film in 3D a bit uncomfortable. I suspect anyone with a lazy eye or astigmatism might have difficulty in really enjoying a film in 3D. I found myself smiling all the way through the film. Although it is an exciting adventure, it also has a really entertaining storyline. The pickpocket who catalogued and archived all the wallets he stole, Snowy's stunts when Tin Tin is kidnapped, the timing of the stunts, the bumbling Thomson twins and the brilliantly swashbuckling Captain Haddock. Probably, as with the books, this is a film I would want to watch again and again. The exciting and stylish world of Tin Tin offers such delightful escapism, I think I will want visit it again.",9,1,4,3 November 2011
Hugo," I thoroughly enjoyed this stunning film
","I was keen to see this film from its publicity posters. I thought the clock looked like the clock on the Musee d'Orsay art gallery in Paris, which used to be Quay d'Orsay railway station, near the river Seine. I have since found out the railway station is Gare Montparnasse. What a treat to have the whole thing re-created in this beautiful film. There are so many facets to it, that I can only give an overall impression. I was totally engaged from the beginning. I wasn't sure about the 3D until I was completely amazed by the effects, especially sparks from the brakes of a locomotive which seemed to fly out into the audience and the smoke which appeared to linger in the auditorium. How brilliant is that! I love the cameos of station life, the flower girl with the fresh flowers which came in on the early train, the zealous gendarme with the mechanical leg, the lady with the dog and her admirer. Those who linger on the station like the smoke from the engines and those who pass through, hardly noticing anything. This film has everything to engage the enthusiast such as re- created steam locomotives, books and an Aladin's cave of a bookshop (like Shakespeare and Co). It demonstrates the mechanics of early film making, weaving the pioneers of the art into the story with a skill which engaged me completely, and tying it into the intricate mechanics of clockwork, a theme which runs through the film. Hugo is crafted to achieve an appeal to all generations. Our family group ages ranged from 8 to 65 and we were all completely bowled over with it. The whole story is carefully explained using the medium of quality film. Wonderful!",10,5,11,4 December 2011
The Artist," Great film.... it was over too quickly
","This film was over much too quickly and created a world I didn't want to leave. It is a demonstration of the film- makers art to be able to explain everything visually. After seeing The Artist I wondered if we ever needed sound in films. George Valentin's smile is infectious. Without speech, facial expressions are everything. The sequence when sound is added is visually witty and funny. Above all the music is great. Rather than reproduce music from the time, the elements of the 1920s style have been reworked into an original and thoroughly enjoyable film score. Elements of the film could stand alone. It could be enjoyed in complete silence. The photography is stunning. The clothes and sets are stylish. The music is great. Together they sparkle.",9,3,4,12 March 2012
The Woman in Black," Dark Gothic film which may give you the creeps
","The Woman in Black. A dark Gothic tale which uses every creepy trick in the genre and finishes in a plethora of loose ends! The filming, where you can see it, is good. A lot of the atmosphere is generated by the music and loud bangs will make you jump. There are few characters who appear to be sane and the story line takes spite and hatred into infinity. If you know England, the Yorkshire village is filmed near the Essex marshes, which perhaps only have the east coast in common. The village and its people are like in the comedy series 'The league of Gentlemen'. Not much in the film is understated or left the the imagination. it perhaps would have been creepier if it had been. The ending is a bit predictable, fatalistic and expected. The most disturbing aspect of the film, from my point of view, is that superstition, ignorance, spite and hatred are the dominating themes. It wouldn't appeal to a tidy mind. The bereaved hero, Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) has gone to a Gothic house ( which looks like Satis House in Rochester, Kent) to sort out the estate. The mess of papers is never sorted out. The house never gets on the market. Disturbed minds are never sorted out. Wherever there might appear to be normality is an undercurrent of extreme insanity. I really liked the vintage car and the vintage railway scenes, although I am reliably informed that the locomotive used dates from the 1930s not the 1910s. I once stayed in a Yorkshire Inn, which had that kind of atmosphere. I decided to go into the small communal lounge upstairs where there were a lot of stuffed animals around the room, the rain beat against the window panes and the wind howled around the eaves. I put the television on and the film Damon Omen started. I heard an uneven rhythmic tramp on the wooden staircase which led to corridor outside the room I was in. The door opened with a creak. My heart was racing by this time. There stood the black- bearded landlord and it was his wooden leg I had heard on the stairs. We both jumped in surprise to see each other. I decided the warmth of the open fire in the flag-stoned bar and a draught Theakston's Old Peculiar with my friends was preferable to watching Damon Omen on my own that night. I was reminded of that incident when I watched The Woman in Black.",7,1,4,12 March 2012
