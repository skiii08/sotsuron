Vertigo," one of the best movies ever made
","Brilliant, intoxicating, dizzying. One of the greatest movies ever made, one of the very best Hitchcocks. Underrated at the time it came out, it is now recognized as a truly amazing and unforgettable film. Kim Novak's best performance ever, and one of Jimmy Stewart's best, a complete change in character for him! See it, see it, see it!",10,2,4,11 July 1999
Shakespeare in Love," The film of the year- delightful!
","The best film of the year, a treat and perfectly done! Equally hilarious and romantic, Shakespeare in Love boasts almost everything a movie can: great acting across the board- especially Gwyneth Paltrow, Judi Dench and Joseph Fiennes (who was completely snubbed by the Academy), a brilliant screenplay, good direction, wonderful production (art direction, editing, cinematography, costumes, etc) humor, romance, emotion, drama and glamour! I LOVED it and can't wait to buy it on video! See it now!",10,5,9,8 July 1999
Romeo + Juliet," surreal but with faults
","While this modern version of Romeo and Juliet does have problems, it succeeds enough to win my recommendation. Set in a world that seems modern but even somewhat out of this world, this visualization is like a Salvador Dali painting, fascinating, new, strange. Some faults include excess modernization or costuming like Pete Posthlewaite's tattoo, Tybalt's 'gangsta' like slickness and definitely Mercutio's drag outfit! That last scene and also the first are very weak and the film can occasionally be a bit awkward. However, Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent. Both have done much of their previous and future work in depressing or tragic roles and both are very convincing with their agony and emotions here. Some of the cinematography is beautifully shot, notably the kiss in the elevator and the aquarium scene. This film should also be commended for exposing teenagers or other modern movie watchers to Shakespeare and how his work is completely relevant today.",10,0,1,18 July 1999
Annie Hall," the best Woody Allen film
","Annie Hall is the best film Woody Allen has ever made- and I love Woody Allen! I think he is the world's best modern comedian, and Annie Hall shows why. Hilarious, quirky, full of that nervous, self deprecating style of Woody, full of oh-so-quotable lines (excellently written), and featuring one of Diane Keaton's best performances.",Null,1,3,11 July 1999
Tarzan," one of the absolute best animated films
","Having seen just about every Disney animated film more than once through numerous babysitting jobs, I have very strong opinions and affections toward the films. In my opinion, the best Disney movies were Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Sleeping Beauty, and Aladdin. Personally, I do not like Fantasia and while I believe Snow White is the most important to the genre, I do not especially care for it. I was thrilled last night to add Tarzan to my list of favorites, particularly in regard to the slump that Disney has been in since The Lion King. Tarzan itself. First the animation, it was gorgeous! The story unfolded great, and if some people disliked the narrative, it was likely because it has been filmed 24 times before! The characters and voices were almost all good. Minnie Driver as Jane was wonderful, completely hilarious, smart, sweet, sassy, a totally sympathetic heroine. Tarzan was good, even Rosie O'Donnell, who I expected to turn in another lame sidekick to the long Disney list made me laugh over and over. The music was wonderful, no awful Prince of Egypt junk to make me squirm in my seat! I wouldn't be surprised to have the CD wind up in my house! While it has been nice to have the characters sing, there should be room for difference, and the 'heroine singing a song about how she doesn't fit in' has happened way too often and was good to lose! To be fair, I can state my problems, but shall preface them by saying they made little impact on the film- 1)the villain. He just wasn't that exciting or unique, but still, the real demon Tarzan was conquering was himself and who he saw himself as.2) I noticed that Disney seems to run into a pattern 3) The elephant character was kind of unnecessary.FINAL WORD: SEE IT!",10,1,1,3 July 1999
The Thin Red Line," starts slow, but becomes excellent
","The Thin Red Line begins slowly and not so auspiciously, but if you're willing to sit through the slow beginning, the rest is well worth it. At least it was for me. I found the beginning too slow, with too much voiceover, and I hated the John Travolta cameo. I thought he looked as though he had had a silly little mustache painted on and it bothered me. But once the soldiers got ready to fight, the film became excellent. It was beautifully, stunningly, brilliantly shot. The cinematography should be a paradigm for future cinematographers to study! The film gave an interesting perspective by seeing the men as one unit instead of developing specific characters and illustrated the bonds and ties they felt toward each other. So, I'd say, you need to be patient since the beginning is slow, but if you are, you will see one of the best movies of the year.",Null,0,1,11 July 1999
