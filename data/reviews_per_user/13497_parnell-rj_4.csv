It," It just isn't scary
","I read the book, so of course my critique on the movie is going to be harsh. I understand that most often comparing books to their theatrical counterparts is comparing apples to oranges. The biggest problem with the movie is that it's just not scary... at all. Nope, not even a little.
I was pretty excited when I heard about the reboot of the It movie, since the original was a bit comical, although it did a fair job of capturing the essence of the characters.
Unfortunately, I think this movie just missed the mark on every level from the rushed character development to the silly looking clown. It felt like a dressed-up, watered-down version of what it should have been. The essence of It isn't in a scary monster-clown. It's in an unseen malevolent force that haunts a group of misfit friends one fateful summer. It's the unknown, inescapable, and underlying foreboding that lurks ever near. This movie just doesn't get it.",3,1,3,17 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," Overrated, but still good
","Endgame is, in my opinion, certainly overrated. That's not to say I didn't like it, it's just not nearly as good as many people make it out to be. My eleven year old son loved it, but I expected more. Maybe my expectations were too high, I'll admit that. After all, it's an action movie with little substance at its core. It's wrapped in all the bells and whistles and quite often delivers an adequately exciting ride, but unfortunately it's just a bit of a mess. The bits that are meant to be heartfelt fell flat for me, riddled with improbable scenarios. Not the type of scenarios that involve godlike aliens wielding ultra powerful rocks, those are to be expected in this type of movie. The scenarios I'm referencing as improbable are the poorly derived emotional moments that just seem to have no structure and lack consistency, detracting from the effectiveness of the characters. Overall Endgame is a worthwhile watch, but not a worthy final stanza. It fell short of being the finale it could have been due to a messy plot and melodramatic tendencies.",7,0,3,16 August 2019
A Quiet Place," I wanted to like it
","I really did want to like it, and even after the opening where the parents leave a small boy out of immediate reach in such a dangerous environment, I told myself to give it chance. Unfortunately the movie is nonsensical and rife with inconsistent ideas. The rules of what the creatures can do and what they can hear seem to change constantly. 
Most of the inconsistencies have been covered in other reviews, as well as the apparent no-brainer things that could have made life easier. I won't go into it again, but the whole thing really is pretty silly. 
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I know that there are many people who liked this movie. That's fine. However, for me, the horrible inconsistencies and ridiculous decision making of the family made it just a bit too absurd for me to have enjoyed.",3,6,12,21 September 2018
Creed II," Creed II is boring and just bad.
","This movie is rife with cliches, all of which are poorly executed. Mix that with a protagonist that's often difficult to like and you get Creed II.
The beginning and end of the movie hold the only action, albeit action that is, again, poorly executed.
The parts of the movie that were meant to be uplifting and inspiring fall completely flat and miss the mark. It gets 3 stars from me merely for the nostalgia which is mostly ruined by the previously mentioned issues. Very disappointing.",3,4,8,14 February 2019
