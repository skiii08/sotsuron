The Monuments Men," Decent acting, so-so script
","Great acting but a so-so script: Nazis bad, Allies good, Frenchy and Brit die in the second reel. Clooney and Damon are good-looking, I get that. (But Bill Murray and character actor Bob Balaban steal the show.) Before the war my family held Europe's greatest collection of Dogs Playing Poker, so I know the story. And apparently in real life GÃ¶ring couldn't tell a real Vermeer from a fake. Woman sitting behind me was shocked, SHOCKED when the Good Guys were elbow-deep in gold fillings, like she had no idea about Josef Mengele's dental fixation. Come on, that's Holocaust 101. I'd hate to be the one to tell her that something happened to President Kennedy.",6,0,1,13 February 2014
