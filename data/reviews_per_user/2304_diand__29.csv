Howl's Moving Castle," War in the Worlds
","Miyazaki creates several worlds in an anti-war tale set in a 19th century small England town in the grip of war. Sophie gets a spell on her by the Witch of the Waste and enters as an old lady Howl's moving castle hoping to make it undone. What follows is an incredible imaginative story where real and fantasy elements mix to create a movie universe where literally anything can happen.The castle / house has one door that can lead to any of four worlds. One is the ordinary world, where Sophie comes from, to make clear that ordinary people suffer from war as they lead their lives. The second leads to a capital city (London?), where power is exercised and war decisions are made by a king. The king is also under a kind of 'spell' as his power is almost taken over by the witch Madam Sulliman, deciding on war and peace (her loyal dog follows Sophie by the way). The way up to the top is long and steep, as there is also a large distance between ordinary citizens and the king, between not having power and having power.The third world is the world of magic and fantasy, only entered by Howl through the black state. As there is also war in this world, i.e. between good and bad, this is a mirror of the war in the real world. The last world is of peace and quiet, but only shows landscapes and almost no people in it, it can both stand for a post-apocalyptic world or for heaven. All these worlds and their boundaries are not strictly defined; a certain world often assimilates into any of the other worlds.As Howl starts winning the peace, Sophie grows younger again, the whole aging process an indication of the suffering of people under war. But Howl pays an increasing high price for his war involvement, as he starts having black feathers. Besides space shifting in the story, time shifting is also used; Howl is at the end under a spell after his battles and only saved much later by Sophie. Calcifer is Howl's heart and soul, therefore almost dead due to his war actions in the fantasy world; even his masterpiece the castle is falling apart as a result of that. The Witch of the Waste meanwhile, is turned into a friendly grandma, indicating she was used by the powers in the fantasy world like a politician or a soldier would be in the real world.The animation is traditional, as always from Ghibli. Most viewers think computer animation is not used at all here, but there is some limited use. The pacing is somewhat slow, its war story is interesting but not that compelling, so we have to rely on Miyazaki's almost unlimited imagination to keep us involved.One advice: if you can see this in its original (Japanese) version.",6,3,6,21 August 2005
Finding Neverland," The power of imagination
","One of the strengths in this movie about the author of Peter Pan is that no characters are so exaggerated put to screen that they couldn't have existed. Emma du Maurier is not an over-evil character; she gives Barrie a difficult time, but has her reasons and in the end even apologizes. Barrie is instructed to be cautious in his relation with the Davies' family at the cricket match in a subtle way. Mary supports her husband to a great extent despite their problems. In Disney's hands there would be no hesitation to remove this balance in story and characters. Note also however that the actual story around the Davies' family and Barrie is completely different and almost the opposite of what is portrayed here.The writing of Peter Pan, inspired by the Davies' family, offers Barrie a way to deal with his marriage trouble at home and a suffocating British society in general. Parallel we have Peter's coping with his father's death to be the reason he starts writing, inspired by Barrie. When Peter's play is performed, the upcoming illness of his mother throws him back from his imagined world to the real world. The scene in the end with the entering of Neverland is the best in the movie, especially the quick edit after-wards.The direction is a relatively weak point as Marc Forster (Monster's Ball) could have used some more imagination on a story about the power of imagination. Yes, he weaves in real and imagined images, but that's the only (visual) trick on offer.Johnny Depp is building a whole new career with sugary movies: Chocolat, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and this sugar sweet one. It is an enormous contrast with the wild roles he took on some years earlier.Finding Neverland is a decent movie, see it if it's the kind of story you generally appreciate.",5,0,3,27 July 2005
Billy Elliot," Practice session
","Billy Elliot tells the simple story of a boy from the working classes having a particular talent for ballet. Because his mining family has troubles from both the death of the mother and a mining strike the talent is not recognized nor supported by his family. He does get support from a middle class woman (Julie Walters) who somewhat projects her own problems on Billy by giving him private lessons and develops his talent. (The class difference being shown by the dog that barks every time Billy or his father enters that community).Others tales are spun in: Billy, Debbie and Michael reach puberty and the confusing time a teenager goes through on that age is well portrayed, for example by Debbie seducing Billy in an interesting scene where the camera rolls on so long it makes the scene almost uncomfortable, the gay Michael seducing Billy in a way, and Billy staying focused throughout, but having fear of failure. And we have the miner's strike at the time of Thatcher in office as a background story. Children as usual seem so unaffected by their environment, as Billy and Debbie walk along a couple of police men with Debbie's stick against them they talk on and aren't even aware of what's going on.Besides the good soundtrack it is sometimes the editing of it all that gives this movie something extra: The weaving of Billy practicing at home from a book and executing that in the gym, mining strike images cut with Billy dancing. Stephen Daldry constructed some of the scenes in The Hours in the same way.Three scenes in particular stand out for me: When Billy's father comes to terms with the talent of his son. When Billy leaves his home for London for his education: He says his grandmother goodbye, one final look at the house and the neighborhood (with the ever-present little girl) is such a good film moment. And the tale of The Swan Lake told when they take the ferry (!), here combined with the music.But still this seems all exercise for the making of a more important piece of art: Stephen Daldry's almost perfect movie The Hours.",7,0,0,15 August 2005
Juno," Premature birth and death
","This is much praised for its unusual approach to the abortion debate combined with its overall cuteness. And although it certainly entertains at a basic level, there is not much more to this than an ordinary girl-loves-boy story combined with a well-off couple with problems and an endearing mom and dad.I may disagree with most of you but for director Jason Reitman, whose timing in comedies is exceptional whereby he far surpasses his father, this is a step down compared to Thank You For Smoking. And although all actors try to make the most of this material (especially Ellen Page, in a very good performance comparable in likability to McDormand in Fargo), it is the critically acclaimed writing I had the most problems with.Screen writing requires so much more a professional attitude and commitment than ordinary writing. Unfortunately, Diablo Cody is largely inexperienced and also not overly gifted as a screen writer. I observed several serious problems: The story is not very well structured, the characters are too one-dimensional and cardboard (take Juno's father, a painful one-dimensional role) and the script contains only a very small amount of instances where the lines themselves are above average. A comedy script has to be tightly written, with every line hitting you and being part of a larger construction where everything fits in and tightens itself around the main story (American Beauty comes to mind).My guess is it is again that time of year where Hollywood needs a new (writing) star on the rise. And her personal story is more fascinating than this one. So I predict that in a few years time no one will talk about Juno or Cody....and for the so-called American indie culture: That died several years ago and was fully absorbed in the Hollywood mainstream. Just for marketing purposes the label is still useful.",4,26,55,24 January 2008
Closer," The photographer, the writer, his wife & her lover
","Patrick Marber's play at first hand seems to portray modern relations between four people. But there's much more to this: Larry is a doctor in order to express a pure physical (human) animal. He reacts to basic instincts and the fact that he 'wins' is perhaps a comment on our modern society. The most fascinating character is Alice (mind the name) because it's not so sure that she exists in the screen world for real or only in the imagination of the characters. The opening and ending sequences seem to support this notion. She's the subject of the writer's book, and the writer is in the movie as the one who documents relations (with her). Typical for a writer is his subjective view on events. A photographer has less ability to distort reality and therefore Alice is crying on the only picture of her that's shown at the exposition. Meanwhile, the doctor lives out his sexual fantasies on her, but the fact that he cannot touch her in vital segments of the movie is only proof of his inability to have human contact or indeed, come closer.Although well structured as a play and movie I was surprised to find the writing details very uneven. Horrible, immature lines (for example, the first lines of the movie) and brilliant, mature lines are intertwined and as a result it brings the movie down as a whole.As director Mike Nichols does a fine job, but some more experimenting would have seriously enhanced the value (see Dogville for example of a more experimental 'movie as a play'). Also the movie drags a little in continually toggling between the love the four characters show for each other.For an actor, there's no better movie to act than in these ones, but it's also very dangerous as there's almost no hiding to cover any weaknesses. Especially Jude Law disappoints here with a terrible flat performance, Julia Roberts holds up reasonably, Clive Owen is interesting and his portrayal will certainly play very well with British audiences, and Natalie Portman shines again and is rapidly developing in one of the better actresses of our time.",7,0,1,25 February 2005
The Lost City of Z," Exploitation and exploration
","Based on the true story of British explorer Percy Fawcett, who made several expeditions to the lost city of Z, believed to be the remains of El Dorado in the Brazilian jungle. The movie follows three of these expeditions and first picks up his life with a long introduction from his military career onwards. The movie becomes only interesting with the start of his first map making expedition on the border of Bolivia and Brazil in 1906. Based on documentary and field research (pottery finds), Fawcett became ever more convinced that a complex civilization had existed there. The movie then touches upon a second expedition initiated by the Royal Geographical Society that lead to controversy about his role in that expedition. The first World War comes in between before he makes his last expedition in 1925 with his son.The script is based on the fascinating book by David Grann, who visited the region in 2005 and came back with interesting findings about Fawcett's expedition. By now, Fawcett has turned into an icon of exploring ancient civilizations, making its way into popular culture, Indiana Jones and The Lost World come to mind.The movie and script is however too obvious for the story at hand. It is painting by numbers, going from phase A to B in Fawcett's life without any intelligent storytelling, ending up with a movie that I first thought was made for TV or online. Compare this to the classic Herzog movies Aguirre or Fitzcarraldo, and it is clear what went wrong here: Being about exploration, the movie itself shies away from exploring cinematic possibilities and just plays it safe. Wouldn't it for example not be far more interesting to just focus on that final expedition and make the multiple accounts into a movie? Why Pitt's Plan B saw anything in this is beyond me, as the company has by now a reputation of risk-taking (and often being awarded for that).But don't get me wrong: The movie is still watchable and the story itself is enough to keep your attention. And it is very nice to see Darius Khondji popping up here as DoP, you can still see his groundbreaking work in Se7en shining through.",5,94,162,22 February 2017
The Godfather: Part II," Masterclass Method acting
","With even the former director of the Actors Studio and proponent of method acting Lee Strasberg having one of the key roles this is one of the strongest acted movies ever. With Brando not present there seems to be more space for others. Especially De Niro impresses here because he had to take Brando's Godfather into account (he mimics his eye, head movement, diction and hand gestures). Both Strasberg and De Niro were nominated but De Niro won from the godfather of method acting.Part 2 is very well structured: Not only is it a great idea to integrate a prequel and a sequel but they enhance each other creating more emotional intensity: death and birth of a child for example. But the greatest achievement in structuring the story comes in the end, when several story lines are intertwining more and more until the short but powerful climax.Again we see that dark and light is used to separate the inner, godfather world from the outer, ordinary world. Only in the beginning there are more lighter scenes in the godfather world to signify Michael's failed efforts to go legitimate. Once again very effective use of doors, mirrors and windows just as in part 1.Where part 1 and the prequel are about the rise the sequel in part 2 is about the fall of the Godfather family (not the empire). Whereas Vito stands for traditional, Italian values, Michael stands for modern, New World-values. The core of the story comes in the end, showing Michael both in the prequel and the sequel as a lonely outsider. That's why his efforts as a family man fail so dramatically, and he's in fact only excellent in 'business'.",9,1,2,16 June 2005
The White Ribbon," Political allegory
","Filmmakers can be excellent in the visual narrative, the structuring of a movie or the staged play itself. Only a handful of them are able to handle these three qualities simultaneously. Haneke for example, although competent in the latter two, misses visual imagination. His movies are mostly too static to be relevant in say 20 years.Haneke's trademark is the hiding of the story beneath the surface and in this respect Das weisse Band can be seen as Caché 2. Besides heavy borrowing from his own movies there is also an extreme amount of copying from very diverse types of filmmakers.Most remarkable is the acting here, almost Scandanavian in nature (restricted, inside-out) and almost identical of that found in Bergman's work. The pastor's section is strongly reminiscent of Fanny and Alexander, both in style and substance. Also borrowed in this segment is Bergman's strong symbolism, although generally less powerful and more direct here (the bird, e.g.).The voice-over's diction and neutral tone reminded me of Dogville and Manderlay (von Trier). A lot of camera-work is also done by fixing the camera behind the character, showing his or her perspective in the story and mostly seen in work by the brothers Dardenne (and later Aronofsky's The Wrestler).Haneke copied the shock-editing from Kubrick, and it is almost strange to see so few other filmmakers use it, while it has become one of Haneke's major styles. The other major style is mentioned before: hiding the story, whereby the reverse consequence is that 'The camera lies all the time' (taken from DePalma).Das weisse Band also resembles The Village from Night Shyamalan, but here the overlapping is only superficial, as the political allegory about the dooming world war is more direct. The allegory itself, albeit intended powerful is relatively weak, as the mapping of events and institutions in the village is not always directly possible to the complex factors surrounding the start of WWI.The whole movie contains almost no music (except for some live music), the persons representing institutions in the movie have no name, things also present in La Pianiste. The tranquility of the acting and the slow pace all transform you to the beginning of the 20th century, but again copied from Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (both Kubrick and Haneke make also heavy use of Schubert).The problem is that Haneke's style is not innovative enough for me to be overwhelmed by his productions. In the first hour Das weisse Band comes a long way in setting out something new, but after all the typicality's of Haneke's movies are introduced, the interest on my side faded. I hope in the future he will act as another famous Austrian and ride more the waves of creative destruction.",7,5,15,16 November 2009
The Machinist," Mechanical references to Dostoyevski
","The Machinist contains a constant stream of references to Dostoyevski: The books on the table, the landlord, signs on walls, name of the main character. But they are so direct that there is no greater cinematic effect as a result. More interesting is the copying of the form of Crime and Punishment, giving away the killer in the beginning but not the process. But as Dostoyevski is the inventor of the novel it doesn't necessarily guarantee a great movie.The double character-trick that made Fight Club such a surprise is once again used. Well portrayed is the psychological mindset of the main character that translates in the blurring of the line between reality and imagination.Art-house movies often suffer from the misunderstanding that a slow pacing in itself guarantees a better movie, but that's only the case if there is interesting camera-work involved or a complicated, multi-layered storyline. Not so here. It's even overexplanatory: For example it would be a nice ending to stop at the double-reporting of the hit-and-run, but it goes on to explain that Trevor can now sleep again; When the fish falls out of the fridge we immediately see the photo as if we can not use our own imagination.Dostoyevski-lovers should certainly check out the Brazilian movie Nina that has more imaginative and visual storytelling.",5,3,5,31 May 2005
Jackie," Image and reality
","Here's a director that really grows with every movie he is making and it is very interesting to follow these steps as a moviegoer: Post Mortem was so idiosyncratic that my interest started, In No he explored the technical side of movie-making only to further advance his technical and storytelling skills in the seriously underrated El Club. And after Neruda Jackie can now be seen as his best work to date, for the first time directing a big production with US actors, producers and staff attached. The result is highly interesting, offering exactly what most mainstream movies are missing nowadays: courage and cinematic exploration.Right from the beginning the impression starts to dawn that something special is done here, combining images of Jackie with reality. What Larraín also does is to make the hand-held camera entering and moving into the personal space around Jackie, to a point where it almost feels inappropriate for the viewer. Jackie's shifting states of mind are in this way well-documented and can be internalized by us, while Portman's outstanding preparation and acting makes this approach work, in collaboration with the cinematography by Stéphane Fontaine, creating what he called 'the sneaky intimacy'. The score by Mica Levi (Under the Skin) creates the eerie, detached atmosphere the movie intends to display.There are many interesting scenes in this movie, but three stand out for me: The airplane scene just brings over the feeling of loss, desperation, solitude and detachment so well I have never seen anything like this in a movie. In the end, the shots of Jackie watching mannequins and shop windows from the car enhances the idea of her public and private image and is rather powerful. And the Malick reference filmed during golden hour in the end is apt here. Downsides are the Camelot musical and priest parts (not the acting itself by John Hurt BTW), they are overlong and start to undo the unsettling effect of the movie. The more graphic parts in effect also detract some of the power of the movie and were unnecessary additions in my opinion.The movie does a great job by mixing movie shots with real footage of the 1962 White House tour; this game is rather effective. Portman now effectively interprets a performance by a character she is playing, creating the basis for the multi-levelled acting performances she is renowned for. For recreating the tour footage in the movie vintage cameras from the 60s were used, comparable to what Larraín did in No, so the scenes shot in 16 mm could be mingled with the documentary footage.",7,1,2,22 February 2017
Gone Girl," Stories, Roles, Identity
","Fincher is a competent director capable of committing himself to a script and executing it in ways that breathe craftsmanship. Cronenwerth as his cinematographer is known for delivering constant quality (Fight Club). Pike was until now an interesting, but somewhat bland actress. We have a relatively inexperienced writer (married to a lawyer). But what these and other people did here is far more than the sum of the parts; Gone Girl with its cheesy trailer will probably some years from now be considered as a classic, that type of movie where initial reception was average. To fully understand what has been done here might require multiple viewings.The first main theme of the movie is the battle between word and image. Both are writers, producing stories and words. The female 'writer' tells her story in voice-over, recreating a supposed past. She uses the spoken word, but imagines using the written word and being a successful writer with illustrated (!) books. She is the archetypical untrusted narrator, weaving stories that might or might not be true. The male writer is more and more overpowered by the image: Being constant on TV having people talk about him, photo shots with supposed fans, observation cameras, etc. This dualism between word and image is mirrored in the detectives: The female acts on words; the male one on images. Note for example that the female detective sometimes wears sunglasses to protect her from the bombardment of images. The whole movie is drained with the male-female dichotomy: marriage as lies, as projections, sex as weapon, power asymmetry.Once the story is revealed the lawyer is introduced: He knows how to combine words and images in weaving a coherent story, not necessarily the truth as Nick would like to put out. The next level is about a battle for storytelling and stories: role-playing, acting and reality starts to intertwine more and more until the resolution comes. Mirroring current trends in (especially but not exclusively US) society that storytelling and misuse of rhetoric has substituted rational analysis, all enhanced by media-images being communicated: See how astounded Nick and the female detective are when in the end the truth can't be accepted as the stories are accepted as facts.The female writer creates her own models and starts enacting and staging them; the robbery a piece of reality sipping through. Note also the overuse of shots with bridges, bridging the gap between image and word, between reality and story, between role and personality. It ends with questions about identity, how it is formed and what it means to develop, have or act out one.There comes another layer as not only the characters in the movie, but also the audience seeing this movie fall victim to this, as also they are lured into the movie and its stories and cannot help but feel almost misused about this. It is an unnerving experience.There is a trap in this kind of movies: That structure stands in the way of emotions (see for example Medem's Sex and Lucia). Not so here; Fincher is extremely competent in balancing the two. It even starts and ends with this debate (duality of the same shots): Reasoning vs. Emotion, another main theme in the movie.The effects of all this are astonishing. Please see it twice.",9,6,19,4 October 2014
1917," The Great War according to Hollywood
","1917 is in itself a pretty decent action movie: tension building is well done, long tracking shots through the trenches, and even a few outstanding scenes reminiscent of the better work of Bresson, like the bridge crossing scene. However it also has several flaws, ranging from minor to more irritating. It seems the script was not well researched, and this is not Kubrick first reading several years into the subject matter, and then coming up with something perfect.First, the hierarchy as portrayed in the movie is incorrect: WWI meant strict hierarchy, it seems very unlikely orders from higher up would be ignored or reflected upon. In WWI the battle field was a reflection of society at that time, from upper to lower class. In Paths of Glory, by now the benchmark for WWI movies, we see the arrogance of the upper levels slaughtering thousands of soldiers for nothing. As Scorsese noted about Paths of Glory: 'It was so honest, that it was shocking, and what made it even more shocking, was the nature of the way it was shot, the use of the tracking camera and the trenches'.Then, the portrayal of the Germans is more WWII-like than WWI: Soldiers from Europe went to the battlefield in WWI seeing this as an honor to defend their homeland, almost like a football match. They were waved out like heroes, most were very nationalistic at that time. If you have seen the excellent Peter Jackson-documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, you noticed little hate between Germans and British. So, the stereotypical Hollywood bad German is driving the action once again in this movie. To the scriptwriters I would advice them to read a history book about the matter.Another inaccuracy is that individual ethnic soldiers are written into the script, maybe to reflect and conform with current society's ethnically mixed makeup. And although groups of colonial soldiers fought in WWI, they mostly did so in their own regiments, just as society was organized then. Few of them fought as individuals in the main ethnic British group.The story contains some odd situations: Wouldn't it be better for the Germans to catch Schofield alive for interrogation, he also goes through an unlikely amount of luck, and after the river scene he ends up just in the right place. The village looks by the way too much like a film set, and some other sets do not look very realistic either.Then the much discussed tracking shots. See again Paths of Glory: The tracking shots there have more tension, more dynamism, and more speed. Here they are dull. I was somewhat disappointed overall in the work of Roger Deakins here, take Sicario as an example of what this man is capable of.Mendes started his career with an almost perfect script, that was also well executed (American Beauty). Since then he thinks he is a great visual film maker, the problem however is that a guy like Nolan surpasses him in both writing and visual execution.",6,10,24,23 January 2020
Million Dollar Baby," Million dollar cliché
","Million dollar baby is three parts: a boxing movie, a father-daughter story and a movie about euthanasia.As a boxing movie it's interesting for camera-work and editing of the boxing scenes, but after all those years it can't still come close to Raging Bull. The father-daughter relation is endearing and in drama terms the best part of the movie. The more complex issue of euthanasia is handled in too simple terms here.Eastwood's movies are almost never dull, but they are so full of simple clichés that there is a moment when the screen magic becomes an over-sentimental and unbelievable journey. The gym that can't hardly exist, the cleaning man that can't buy socks, the fighter winning everything in the first round, the family that is too crude for words. the Danger guy for the funny note, etc. Morgan Freeman's uninteresting repetition of his voice-over in The Shawshank Redemption tops this off.",5,13,26,22 February 2005
Garden State," Numb and dumber
","American independent cinema has always played an important role in the shaping of the future of cinema itself. But in the last few years, the major studios have attracted talent much earlier and have been more open to experiment than before, because movies with only a simple formula are losing out and the population as a whole demands more 'intelligent' movies. As a result a decline in the quality and diversity of indies can be observed. Even stronger: independent cinema itself is becoming a clichéd affair; Garden State is just proof of that.On the first level we have the simple story of a young man returning to his home state and coming to grips with past and present. All the clichés are nicely presented (hey, there's even a love story!) but there are also hints of originality (the wallpaper scene, the certificates on the wall). And in presenting some unfamiliar worlds Garden State becomes downright interesting: e.g. a dysfunctional functional family, the hotel scene.The problem is on the second level: in referring to some current state of mind of characters or important aspect of the story Braff uses very simple direct references. So, when Andrew is on the brink of a choice he puts him on the edge of an abyss, when he is thinking about leaving his girlfriend he goes up the stairways leaving her on an equal level, etc.What saves Garden State from becoming a disaster are two very good actors: Ian Holm and Natalie Portman. Their subtle and layered performances are worth the admission price alone.",4,1,2,22 February 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Road to creativity
","Tim Burton usually creates wonderful fantasy movies but this time he adds an extra layer that lifts it above his previous work. Part of this comes from the story by Roald Dahl, but here he squeezes everything out of it and then some.Chocolate making serves here in the story and movie as a metaphor for creative thinking. Four children represent a characteristic that hinders creative thinking: greed, excessive competitiveness, money and science. Each is eliminated in the road to creativity except for a heart (family values). These are incorporated in the end to give sense to the creative process. One level higher we have Johnny Depp as the creative actor and Tim Burton as the creative moviemaker. Both face the same obstacles as Willy Wonka; Tim Burton is Willy Wonka to be more precise.The movie resembles and refers to The Wizard of Oz in its sets and music. And there is a nice reference to 2001 when Mike Teavee is made shorter, 2001 being one of the most creative movies ever made. The criticism of TV is still up to date nowadays.This succeeds also thanks to the wonderful work of the production and art departments but it is the cinematography of Philippe Rousselot that gives the movie something extras in shaping the worlds. Once he did Diva, a movie that redefined existing art direction. The enormous color contrast between the gray cities and the colorful sets enhance the experience here.Anyone who thinks this is about Jackson hasn't got the message. Besides that Burton has clearly dismissed all references. There is however a short dance by one of the children that resembles Jackson's and the interpretation of his role by Depp makes all the gossip somewhat understandable.The songs are not the most creative parts and somewhat repetitious. They could have edited this to a shorter movie. Why do most movie makers still think that more is more?",6,0,1,21 July 2005
Logan," State of the Union
","This is the third and final installment of the Wolverine series and the tenth X-men movie. In a post-apocalyptic near-future no mutants have been born for some time. Professor X (or Charles Xavier) is seriously ill and dependent on medication. He lives with a weakened Logan (or Wolverine) and Caliban in a rundown factory near the US border in Mexico. Logan has a job as limo driver and smuggles prescription drugs to Mexico for Charles. Disillusioned, their ultimate dream (and last wish for Charles) is buying a camper or boat and make a final retreat.James Mangold has a typical directorial style you can almost instantly recognize: Relatively long tracking shots, slow in tension building, meanwhile freeing the camera to explore the space beyond the characters. Rest assured however that the action scenes are fast-paced and on the firm side of the R-rating, a bit gory here and there. In my opinion the movie could have been cut by some minutes, as it is overlong.Jackman and Stewart are well known, but the real revelation here is the kid Laura (Dafne Keen), with a stunning performance reminiscent of Jodie Foster in Scorsese's early works when she had about the same age. At the world premiere I attended she also stole several moments.After 9/11 we saw an outburst of movies that directly or indirectly referenced the event. The ascent of the current US administration will be another such watershed moment where movies will directly or indirectly criticize new policies. Although this was shot before the election there are several eerie parallels in the script to the current themes in US society and politics: Disillusionment (simple wishes of Logan cannot be realized), availability of health care, illegal immigrants, border politics, Canada (not the US) as Eden, the promised land. Medical experimentation by US companies inside Mexico and most striking: the dreamers. There is a central theme throughout the movie about dreams and reality, made more poignant here by the reference to the X-Men comic books themselves.Most of the time Marvel movies are too predictable and straightforward for me; this is (like and again unlike Deadpool) different. See it for yourself!",6,11,48,21 February 2017
Avatar," Aliens 3D
","Hailed as a great technical achievement by introducing a new generation of stereoscopic cameras, Avatar changed the movie theater landscape. A couple of years later, it seems already somewhat dated in its use of 3D. Movies like Life of Pi have enhanced standards in 3D, offering a more total immersive experience than here, for example in reflection, depth and other visual effects.The worlds defined are beautiful and interesting. The cinematography by Mauro Fiore was correctly rewarded with an Academy Award, as was the production design. Some ideas in the movie are also fascinating and modeled on biology: neurons, synapses, sources, ecological diversity and the interconnected networks between all things alive and dead. See how in the end nature cooperates and triumphs over the next quarterly statement.Furthermore, the integration of several genres in one movie is an accomplishment in itself: war, adventure, science fiction and romance. Despite being a good overall idea, the further detailed script following is less intelligent and especially the lines itself are sometimes badly written, bordering even on the edge of being kitsch and laughable. The avatar idea is in itself great, but again needed more work in the script, just going in and out your avatar is too simple and the idea as a whole should have been further explored (introducing some welcome mythification in the story).The message is anti-war and pro nature, but to make that statement it needs the war movie format to keep us entertained. It also references Aliens (even Ripley has a new role), and in form and style there is too much overlapping. I hope they fix these problems in Avatar 2.",6,2,6,3 January 2013
Life Is Beautiful," We'll take the bus back, okay?
","One of the first shots of La Vita è bella / Life Is Beautiful is when Guido (Roberto Benigni) and his friend Ferrucio (Sergio Bini Bustic) are driving their car through the beautiful countryside. Ferrucio reads a poem, Guido listens, the car brakes fail, but Guido thinks it is part of the story. It is the whole movie in a nutshell and a prelude of things to come. As a result of the brake failure they enter the village where he is hailed as The Great Dictator, in a scene meant as a tribute to that movie. Later we have the two children Adolf and Benito fighting on the bench. And the rather funny scene where Guido explains what it means to be Arian to the children as fake inspector.The first half shows the simple life in an Italian village, with Guido falling in love with Dora (Nicoletta Braschi). The rise of fascism is told as a background story first, but soon invades every facet of life. Guido later has married Dora and they have a child Giosué (Giorgio Cantarini). Guido has set up a book store (a reference to the burning of books by the Nazis). The second part starts with the train transport of all, with Guido commenting on the train ride to his son: It's the kind of risky humor that Benigni uses by mocking the whole Nazi-regime and its procedures. We see this again when the camp rules are translated by Guido.Of course this is not a real concentration camp, Benigni abstracts the horrors (almost nothing is shown) to make the Nazis look ridiculous in their manners and behavior. Guido remains more or less the same human he was in Italy, only his environment changes and that makes the dehumanizing of the Nazi-victims only more poignant. The movie also keeps the Nazis consistently inhuman as there is not one human aspect in the whole movie to be seen of them. Even the friendly Dr. Lessing is turned in a non-human (He only saves Guido for his own riddles, and shows no interest in saving Dora). And the movie also works by showing only the perspective of one family that almost breathes life. But the movie is too long in the beginning and lingers somewhat (the uncle's house for example). It all feels like watching a movie from the 40s or 50s, even in the acting and direction.When this movie came out, there was some debate about whether it was ethical to make a comedy about concentration camps. Roberto Benigni knew he took an enormous risk with this movie, and in lesser comedy hands this would not have worked out the way it did. But as art is all about taking risks, he was correctly rewarded for a new addition to coping with the history of the holocaust. As time will pass, probably still other ways will be found to tell this story.",8,1,4,15 August 2005
Eyes Wide Shut," Beyond perfection: Sculpting in light
","Kubrick experimented with styles and changes in styles in the narrative. Here he changes the standpoint in the narrative from a movie about relationships to a thriller and then changes once again to more philosophical issues. Inside these major styles there are smaller changes in storytelling, introducing sub-layers in the story. Furthermore, the movie repeatedly questions its own existence and portrayal of events.Camera-work is once again amazing. Every shot is perfect, it feels like sculpting in light. A wide variety of lenses and color scheme's is used. Take for example the wonderful scene in the pool room that is pivotal in the movie and took so much time. (Note also the congruity in that scene between the change in the actor's positions and the change in the story). Colors are also used to code the whole movie (with a crazy amount of detail: even the fence is blue).After these aspects, there's the story. Eyes Wide Shut explores the other side of a faithful life: Bill Harford enters an unfamiliar world where he doesn't know the rules. But there's also commentary about these worlds: the masks, the shabby apartment, the daughter prostitute. The character of Alice(!) suggesting the mystery.Kubrick thought of this movie as his best ever. It is. It is probably the best movie ever made. In a few years time it will (as usual with him) be heralded as a masterpiece.",10,11,22,22 February 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," The battle of the sexes, again
","The first surprise in Mr. & Mrs. Smith is the beginning: As the couple is interviewed by their marriage counselor we get scenes derived from the world of Woody Allen. It sets the tone for things to come: We see the couple in suburbia with their mechanical, uninteresting life (peas, please). The whole action part of the movie is set up parallel to the marriage crisis unfolding. First they have minor quarrels, the relationship explodes when finding out their true identities and war is upon them. Only by working together against the outside world and destroying their suburban home along the way, true happiness sets in. So, the action is interwoven with the marriage crisis and the comedy, but there's another level in the story: They frequently comment the whole story ('Happy endings are just stories that haven't finished').The suburbia-theme can be found throughout the whole movie. The end scenes first start off with a family car where several features of it are used to fight their adversaries; then we end up in a kind of Home Depot-store, just the kind of battleground they usually go for shopping and feel right at home to battle their enemies.The names Jane and John Smith already suggest their anonymous, uninteresting lives. Also take a look at the agencies / companies they work for: Jane's company is up-to-date, but only inhabited by women, John's is old-fashioned and looks redundant in the modern world.Simon Kinberg did a good job here. See the memorable quotes-section for some nice examples of how clever this is written on a basic level. You start wondering if the script of xXx: State of the Union was wasted, because it had more potential. I am curious what he makes of X-Men 3. Doug 'Bourne Identity' Liman's fast-paced, fluent and light directorial style fits in well. He adds some jokes to the already many side-jokes and in-jokes in the script (at least I lost count; Benjamin wearing a Fight Club T-shirt, in most scenes there are jokes in the background visible). But it is overlong like most movies these days so cutting it by about 20 minutes would have made a better movie. And why do they keep showing previews where they already show the whole movie (De Palma's Femme Fatale-preview once contained literally the whole movie, showed 100 times faster).This is the kind of movie you forget about 15 minutes after leaving the theater, but it is worth a look because few blockbuster movies succeed in integrating action and comedy properly.",6,2,5,29 July 2005
War of the Worlds," 9/11 meets evil E.T.
","When 9/11 passed, Spielberg argued that no movies about it should be made, because the events were too horrific and commercial exploitation would be distasteful. Some years on, I was very surprised to see him just do that. It's not direct, but rather indirect that the comparison is drawn: dwindling papers, photos of missing loved ones, debris and dust, enemy already among us, etc. All reactions are passing also: From denial (Rachel), saving your own soul (Ray) to combative (Robbie). Ogilvy (Tim Robbins) is probably the most interesting character in this sense: he combines all these reactions but ultimately turns insane. If you draw the comparison further it doesn't hold up well because it tries to combine 9/11 with the original War of the Worlds. So it ends up more like an evil E.T. (with again a strong emphasis here on a broken family) Tension building is very well done. Time is taken to set up the situation, many shots are distant to get the wide panorama. Especially the hazy and over-lit shots in the beginning are interesting, suggesting something is out there. It's also a very dark film with a limited uplifting end. The scene with people fighting for a car or a place on the ferry are almost in another category. Note also that the church is the first building to be demolished by the invaders.To bring it up once again: The PG-13 is what Spielberg is usually aiming for (murder on Ogilvy and feeding of tripods with humans not shown), but there remains much to be seen where the rating is debatable (people blown to pieces, bodies in the river). A lesser known director would not have come away with this.Compared to the recent Kingdom of Heaven however, there is no ultimate political statement, no vision on the whole project shining through. This has always been Spielberg's weakness. And while he is almost as competent technically as his late friend Kubrick, that's the main reason why their movies are on different levels.",6,0,6,30 June 2005
Wedding Crashers," Childish. Juvenile. Pathetic. (not my words)
","The storytelling killed this one for me. Yes, we know they are divorce mediators after several minutes of mundane dialog hammering that out. We know they crash weddings after letting us visit too many of them. And the way the senator's family part, taking up the largest part of the story, ends is predictable to the extreme. For a comedy clocking in at almost 2 hours there's not enough arc in the story, so we have to rely on the script at a basic level, which contains some funny lines, but more not-so-funny ones. We then still have the comedy skills of Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn and later Will Ferrell to make this work, but they have the comedy talents of an average stand-up comedian, not able to make a feature-length movie very interesting. There were almost no laughs in the audience, the only character and actress that fitted the screwball here was Gloria (Isla Fisher), in an amusing over-the-top performance.As marriage is presented here as a lie, they crash weddings to profit from that lie (after all they are divorce mediators being confronted by that lie everyday). As death is not a lie, John suddenly sees the light here. It is therefore a rather strange turn to let this end in two marriages, and then crash weddings again, although it is in the romcom-handbook. But that is the level of stupidity in the script that made this such an uninteresting comedy.",3,3,6,19 August 2005
Downfall," The fall and decline of the Third Reich
","The whole story of Hitler's downfall is told through the eyes of his former secretary Traudl Junge. It starts with her selection, and while another woman born and raised in Berlin is dismissed in an instant, she is chosen because of her Bavarian background (Hitler was born in Austria, not far from Bavaria). She died in 2002 and in the documentary I'm toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretärin / Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary she is interviewed and the script of Der Untergang / Downfall is also based on that interview. The problem I have with her is that I just can not believe her naivety. Yes, she admits in the end of Der Untergang (taken from that documentary) that she should have known better. But I personally still believe that she knew better but went along and this movie and the documentary suggest there are some people defending or at least believing her.This is the most expensive German production ever made and it shows. Especially the sound and sound editing works impressive as we have the bombing and fighting always going on in the foreground or background. Every time a person considers the bunker as an ordinary place to live, a sound (loud or soft) can be heard. The confined space within the bunker is also what makes this work with the opportunity to make shots of the long central hall where a lot of drama can be viewed with a distant camera-eye. By letting the viewer spend such amount of time in the bunker the restrictions and drama becomes only clearer. The war outside is used to create the contrast with the relative tranquility within and to show the difference between the suffering of the people and the madman inside that never once cared for them in the end. But the action outside is too sketchy, most characters are anonymous so it makes it hard to identify with any of them. This isn't on the level of Saving Private Ryan, by now the standard for war movies.With Hirschbiegel's background as TV-man this is a well made documentary dressed as fiction, but that alone does not make cinema. There are a couple of scenes that reach that level: Speer shown in the end in front of one of his own neo-classical buildings, a boy walks from a battle scene and we hear gunfire only to find out seconds later it is the typewriter of the secretary, the readings of the letters of the females intertwined with the suicidal deaths of a male and female SS-soldier.The fall of empires never comes unexpectedly, and although such regimes do not disappear in an instant, they ultimately dissolve in a few days. As the end nears, Hitler is shown increasingly as an idiot losing all sense for reality and giving random orders, appointments, and still decorating soldiers. The only thing important to him is dog-like loyalty. From his loyal followers we see a range of reactions: From the true believer Goebbels, sacrificing his whole family and his own forces, to the pragmatic Himmler, the loyal (but not to every price) Speer and the human Schenck.Hitler did what the Germans demanded from him. He was a simple man with a humble background and limited capabilities who luckily failed in what he tried to accomplish. He saw Stalin as more ruthless, which to an extent is historically true, although their atrocities are of the same proportions.This movie stays close to the known facts, and is therefore interesting as a history lesson. But for those familiar with all facts this is only an annotation, and for those not familiar it lacks a proper introduction in all the characters. Unfortunately it may send the wrong message: showing Hitler (perfectly acted by Bruno Ganz) as just a human being (soft spoken, animal lover and a vegetarian, all true by the way) it may be an attractive document for neo-Nazis too. So, to what end was this made, because there could be a somewhat stronger message like Hirschbiegel's Das Experiment has.",6,5,11,29 July 2005
American Gangster," Causal ambiguity
","If a top classic movie is made, it is often unsure how this came about. That is, if all the right disciplines do all the right things this is just not enough. The positioning and interaction of these elements is what makes a true classic, so if for (a simple) example a camera move is followed by a shift in the story and the characters at the same time, you have an enhanced experience. It is more often than not the case that filmmakers are not aware how they made these interactions work. This causal ambiguity also explains why it is impossible to replicate just another classic by the same or different film makers. A top director is however more aware than the average ones of these interactions and often exercises a far larger control over the total work that in these days have turned into gigantic, almost non-manageable projects. The late Kubrick comes to mind as the genius and control freak in this regard, and he also let his movies evolve, thus avoiding the trap of rigidities and able to adjust the interactions.Ridley Scott is one of the top directors of our time. American Gangster contains dozens of interesting shots and perfect location shooting and set building. Ridley Scott makes every scene worth looking at in itself. The apartments in a dilapidated neighborhood looking like prisons, the framing of the first shots (those with Bumpy) and the last shot in the transfer of one area into another, the many references to other (gangster) movies (Scarface, Goodfellas for example) are examples of his great talent. Also in storytelling, he refrains from presenting the story in a simple manner and let us work to combine some of the pieces.But the story and especially the script is far too linear for Scott's talent. In Gladiator he could expand on the notion of the arena as a theater, in Matchstick Men he could play with the audience in tricking them in a movie about tricks, in Kingdom of Heaven he could link it to the Islam-Christianity dichotomy. But here, there are just some loose elements like Vietnam, drug-addicted NY neighborhoods and a black imitating Italians. Steven Zaillian's script is just badly written, not able to make this story work beyond the obvious and also contains some unnecessary elements that detract from the story (the love story for example. Next to this I find it hard to believe that this was edited by Pietro Scalia, who did the fantastic editing in Black Hawk Down and Gladiator.Denzel Washington has never topped his performance in Training Day and is unable to do something extra for this movie; Russell Crowe tries to replicate his performance from A Beautiful Mind, and both are also not able to surpass the limitations of a weak script. American Gangster contains luckily an enormous amount of side roles that are true revelations.So in the end American Gangster is in itself a decent movie, but pales in comparison to the movies it tries to build on, such as Goodfellas/Casino, Cidade de Deus and The Godfather.",7,2,8,10 November 2007
Trainspotting," Choose Welsh
","Trainspotting remains in style faithful to the book by Irvine Welsh, but sometimes deviates from it. For example the end is very different because here Renton comes out clean and 'normal' but in the book he stays on to be a junkie. The movie has the same punk-like edgy form as the book and is well translated to screen: Fast edited sequences, it radiates energy, breaks its own form (fantasy elements), cultural landscapes changing and even a balanced view on drugs. The many excrement scenes are not for everybody's taste, but shows only the filth sometimes associated with drug use.The characters are rather unbelievable as junkies. Here they remain clean-shaven, relatively fresh-looking, social and to an extent trustworthy people, where real users have the opposite characteristics. And the sometimes beautiful, long sentences coming out of the mouths of some characters being linguistically deprived are not very believable either. But the 'Choose Life'-voice over narration in the beginning is still great.It has intelligent storytelling, for example how AIDS is first introduced by means of the quiz and the fact that Renton in one scene already puts his passport in a locker. The change in music and drug culture is well done here.But from the London-part onwards the best parts are gone and it transforms more into a buddy-movie with a twist.",6,2,5,26 July 2005
Amélie," Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe
","This movie roughly falls into three parts: The first handles the birth and upbringing of the main character, Amelie Poulain. With an incredible pace Jean-Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination. This starts with the conception of Amelie and goes on with important events/traumas in the life of a child. The voice-over works very well here and gives the feel of watching a pseudo-documentary (like Woody Allen's Zelig). The absurdity of many situations and explanations are extremely humorous. The editing and camera-work are key elements to this.In the second part Amelie lives alone in Paris. The house and the many characters inhabiting it is reminiscent of 'Delicatessen', except for the dark undertone which is replaced by a more gentler, realistic (although still somewhat surreal) portrayal of Paris residents. In this segment the drama factor plays up, especially when Amelie exposes us to the loneliness of the big city dwellers. Also the game of luck and destiny is reversed: events don't just happen to her but Amelie discovers her presence in the world can make the difference for other persons as well. She starts to influence events: rewarding/encouraging the good and more or less punishing the bad people around her. In this part the pace of the movie is much slower, the voice-over less prominent and some scenes even fall in repetition (2nd punishment of the grocer for example), which lead to the conclusion that the movie would have gained by more editing and deleting in this segment.Obviously the third part centers around the luck of Amelie herself, the game of luck is again played by her and her would-be lover Nino (Mathieu Kasovitz, internationally famous for La Haine/Hate). She plays a cat and mouse-game with him (and vice versa). The style of this part is a mix of the first two parts and has the best of both.The story-telling in this movie is very imaginative and the movie feels like an absurd fairy-tale for grown-ups. Audrey Tautou plays Amelie perfectly well as a naive, shy girl who everybody underestimates. The overall story is about those small moments in life where a particular good or bad choice defines your life: The tick of lost opportunity influenced by circumstances (here abstracted to Amélie's influence mainly) and later on your life defined by your memories of it (hence the collection box and the photographs). The element of time is important here: The painter, already commenting Amelie's life story and the story we are watching, filming the clock outside. Photographs in pieces and glued together are used to tell something about lives, Amélie uses the same photographs to find her lover. Overall the movie has an air of nostalgia all over it. It is a highly romantic movie in the proper context of romanticism (one aspect being that products of the popular imagination could equal or even surpass those of the educated; Jeunet being a far more popular and successful filmmaker than the big names of the French nouvelle vague nowadays is a nice parallel here).Downsides are the length of the movie: The 'less-is-more'-principle would have created a movie on an equal scale as American Beauty. Furthermore the fragmentary way the story is told (inherent to a documentary style) doesn't always work well either. Also pacing is sometimes way too fast (especially a problem in countries with subtitling), sometimes somewhat slow.What remains is a unique movie made by a unique film maker with an extreme sense of detail for the sad and the absurd.",8,0,2,1 August 2005
Fantastic Four," Hollywood 101
","From this you can perfectly observe how Hollywood works. First, we have the screen writing from Mark Frost, best known from the mystery Twin Peaks. So, we have various elements from the writers' handbook that are now familiar: References to God-like figures, a mystery (blind) character called Alicia, a fantasy character called Grimm. I guess the four characters were initially taken from the four elements. Michael France wrote GoldenEye and Hulk, which earned him a co-writer ship here. So we get the nasty boss and dictator (who turns literally into steel) and the Hulk-figure. The director Tim Story, from Taxi, comes along and adds Taxi-humor to this. Everything is mixed and we have a movie that's incoherent but slightly entertaining.Comic books are usually one-dimensional. In order to translate this to the big screen movies have to add some dimension: X-Men added drama, Sin City used the comic book container to do film noir and this only tries to throw in fun. The science mentioned in Fantastic Four is completely ludicrous except for some basic facts, but that fits the angle.We have Chris Evans as the new Tom Cruise, and Jessica Alba from Sin City again in a comic book adaptation.Critics hate this because it is no cinema. They see hundreds of movies and know this does not stand out. The larger public only sees a few movies per month and is mostly entertained by this. So this makes money while getting panned.",4,2,4,13 July 2005
The Island," Attack of the clones / consumers
","Michael Bay has spent more time of his life making commercials than other directors do in the beginning of their career, making him an expert in just that. Doing commercials teaches you a lot about shooting a scene in detail with some originality (Guy Ritchie comes to mind) and therefore his visual style is the best thing on offer in this action movie, here enhanced by an interesting screenplay, a good production design (Nigel Phelps) and nice cinematography (Mauro Fiore). And without Bruckheimer as producer he is willing to aim for something higher, not afraid to take a chance. It's a pity that this failed at the box office in the US (although it did a lot better in the rest of the world), as it is one of his best movies and it shows once again the unpredictability of the public. Lessons will be learned and next time he will surely make a dumb movie again.The way the clones are kept on the facility is a mini-world in itself but also a commentary on the consumer society we have become, as the clones behave as consumers but also one level higher there are clients ordering them. (In this context it is rather clumsy to put in that many product placements.) As work and religion are used to keep the clones under control, the food scenes in the beginning serve as an indication of how humans become greedy and picky, using social behavior to get what they want (Jordan) , and also becoming investigative (Lincoln). With the lottery as indication of personal luck, but only a lie. The director of the facility sees himself as an earthy equivalent of God (and the bad guy an Englishman again, what have they done to deserve this?).Time is taken to set out the story. When the action scenes follow, Bay knows where to place his always moving camera in a scene, in contrast to Rob Cohen for example. The POV is especially good in the car chase scenes with objects going right at the camera and in the skyscraper scene, where depth is put to good use. But it is sometimes a little too long and there is a tendency towards overkill; some rock music is used without any effort to check what songs would work. In more detailed shots of computers and handling of objects it resembles Minority Report. The futuristic city and post modern homes make it visually attractive to look at. Many of the perfectly framed and colored shots hint in the direction of that other Spielberg-movie, AI.For once this movie is not too long, but too short. They could have elaborated on the start of the facility and on Sarah Jordan (obviously dead without touching that in the movie), because as she was severely ill that created the ethical dilemma the whole movie was about: Is cloning allowed for your own medical purposes? The movie makes a strong case for no, as even the former black liberty fighter joins the battle and McCord also helps out (with his death as a result).",6,1,2,23 August 2005
The Godfather," Doors, windows, mirrors
","In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later.",8,3,7,14 June 2005
