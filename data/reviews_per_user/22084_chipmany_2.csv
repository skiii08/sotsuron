Minority Report," Spielberg + Cruize is not enough. We need a good story, too.
","This action/sci-fi/thriller/mystery etc. movie does very well in some of its genre, but not too great as other. It is an excellent futuristic fantasy, describing the life we may have when as senior citizens. The action and special visual affects are also terrific. The pace is just right. But, the main problem here is the story. The thriller/mystery part of this film is very weak, and too much can be anticipated well in advance. There are a couple of huge holes in the plot, not to be mentioned, since I don't want to be a spoiler. The ending is a real let down. The paranoia twist is also played in this film. It is a successful twist in this movie, but maybe someone should tell those people in Hollywood that it is getting very worn. Or maybe I am just missing what the public really want to see. My last comment on this film may sound a little bit 'where are our family/moral values', but that is not my point. I will try to prevent spoiling, but if you haven't seen the film, and want to play it on the safe side, stop reading here. Throughout the film, and of course through the trailers to it, it tries to be a suspense/action film. It is not a 'gruesome serial killer on the loose, psychotic maniac being chased down by detectives' movie. Many people hate such films and avoid them. But, at one point in this film, for an unexplained reason, which does not serve the plot in any way, Tom Cruise confronts a killer, who starts describing in too much graphic detail, how he murdered a young boy. From this point on, my girlfriend couldn't stop thinking about it, and this ruined the film for her. She ended up hating it. I can't understand why this scene was included in an otherwise relatively clean film.",6,0,0,25 September 2002
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Some of the best action and visual effects created yet!
","Arnold Schwarzenegger uses his stiff acting and strange accent, together with his body-builder physique, to create the wonderful T-800 cyborg programmed to go back in time and save John O'Conner and his mother Sarah. This is Schwarzenegger's best non-comic role. He is truely convincing as a cyborg, his emotional bonding with John is moving.The T-1000, a cold cyborg sent by the forces of evil to kill young John, is an unstoppable, invincible, form changing killing machine. This character is created by an incredible display of visual affects. By taking the form of a Highway Patrol Officer, it is the ultimate nightmare of any Establishment-Paranoia freak.A truely wonderful movie. The best visual affects to date, riveting action. Schwarzenegger at his best.Can't wait to see Terminator III.",9,1,1,13 December 2001
