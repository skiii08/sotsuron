Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat goes to America!
","I went to the premier of the film, and even before the film started while Borat was speaking on stage he already had the audience in stitches! I have never seen such a funny film in my life, there is a gag every minute (which is really a top class joke). Borats ways are so ridiculous they just make the film what it is. I found that after about 10 minutes my face muscles were hurting cos it was so funny. And afterwards i was still smiling for about 2 hours, it felt weird not to smile. This will be an absolute hit when it comes out. There is a lot of satire to Jews, gypsies and most of all the Kazachs, it is all clearly a joke, and Sasha Baron Cohen is a Jew himself so he is forgiven. This is a top film and a must see.",10,6,29,1 November 2006
