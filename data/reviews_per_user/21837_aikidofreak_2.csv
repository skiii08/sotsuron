The Avengers," I never thought this would work out... and then it did.
","I went to this movie going 'oh my god, Michael Bay meets Spderman vs X Men or something. I didn't really had high hopes for it. But I figured 'what the hell' and went to see it anyway.Just came back from the cinema. And I must say I haven't been this entertained in a long time watching a movie. The Avengers is really a -lot- of fun to watch.first off, the scenario. Sure, the story is a bit shaky, a few plot holes here and there. But nothing that makes you go 'wtf is this nonsense?'. For a story that covers such a weird, unrealistic theme, it's pretty believable actually.The characters. This is where The Avengers shines. Throw a bunch of (some less) well known superheroes in 1 movie, throw in a semi-slapstick villain and let rip. all the characters are good. Stark, Thor and Hulk provide the lulz. Even Loki allows for a few laughs. I've never heard of Black Widow or Hawkeye but they fit in just fine and carried the story along.the action. Michael bay, take note. This is how you let stuff blow up and get demolished -without- giving the audience seizures. the action is fast paced, well times and the screenplay at times is just brilliant. hats off.the humor. the backbone of this film. very witty lines, good slapstick jokes from time to time. some hilarious (punch)lines that really make you laugh. It's not just Iron Man and his snide remarks this time. Almost everyone chips in. this movie doesn't take itself very serious at times. And that's a very good thing.If you're a superhero fan, go see this. you simply cannot be disappointed I think. I myself am no superhero fan but I was entertained for the whole 2.5 hours the film went on, not 1 moment bored.What a laugh.",8,1,4,5 May 2012
The Expendables 2," Memories... good ones!
","Yes, I gave it 9 out of 10. I normally don't do that. Why did I give it 9 out of 10? Not out of sentiment. I gave it 9 / 10 because Expendables 2 is simply hilarious and entertaining from start to finish.STORYwell, the trailer pretty much covers the entire story when Stallone says: 'find em, track em, kill em'. Yes, no Oscar work here. but who cares? The bad guys have stuff that the good guys don't want them to have. Both sides have craploads of weaponry. You can see where this is going.CHARACTERSBasically, everyone plays a version of themselves from a 90-ies action flick. In essence, we have Rambo, Crank, John mcClane, the terminator, Walker Texas Ranger, He-Man and assorted dudes in 1 film. JcvD gets to play the bad guy. And does so quite well. don't expect any superb acting or character development though.SPECIAL EFFECTSlots and LOTS of explosions. That about covers it. Oh, and 1 crappy CGI helicopter getting shot down by an unmanned CGI motorcycle. Yes, you read that right. this -is- the Expendables, after all.THE GOOD STUFFSo why is this movie so much fun to watch? you have to go see this movie if you re from the Delta Force / Rambo / terminator Die Hard generation. Seriously. the movie contains tons of jokes and references to those old action movies. Thats 1 strong point.2nd strong point: this movie does not take itself seriously, nor do the actors. and thats why there's so much magic in the air. You can see the energy beaming off all the old skoolers doing their thing. Some 1 liners are so hilarious you actually choke. Best one goes to (who else but) Chuck Norris shortly after he is introduced.3rd strong point: the most obvious one. the participating actors. so much win in 1 film. the magic. it's simply so much fun to see all the old schoolers going at it in the same movie.4th strong point. the plot twists.No, not really. Seriously, no.TL: DR;Expendables 2 is VERY entertaining. It delivers more than its prequel, and then some. Willis and schwarzenegger get bigger roles. even Norris has a lengthy cameo. there's over the top action, 1 liners, winks and references to old movies. I've no idea how long it was but time flew by and after the 275289456359th explosion it was already over and left me wanting for more.A must see if you want to have some old school fun, no strings attached.do leave your brain at the door and don't be a critic. Do so and you'll have a blast.",9,2,5,25 August 2012
