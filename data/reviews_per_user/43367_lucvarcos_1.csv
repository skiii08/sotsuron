The Hangover," Best of the decade
","There are so many different direction I could go here so here I go....I remember seeing a billboard for this movie about a month before it came out and I thought FAIL. Now on Friday of opening weekend, I just blew everything off and figured what the hell. The theater was packed which surprised me but it was easily one of the rare gems that comes out during the year. Most movies are overly hyped and consequently never live up to expectations but this movie hit on every cylinder. It's one of those movies that magically finds it's way into o my DVD almost on a weekly basis. The script was hilarious, it was well shot, but I have to give most of the credit to the actors. The comedic timing enhanced the hilarity of the storyline ten fold.I knew of Bradley Cooper from Wedding Crashers and he played a very similar role here. He's the cool, jocky guy...likable even though he's a bit of a jerk. He did a great job but the star of them all was obviously Zack. The guy steals every single scene. I can't go much into detail, it's just something you have to experience. Easily my favorite comedy of at least the past 5 years.",9,1,2,15 May 2010
