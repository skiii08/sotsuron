Sucker Punch," Why the haters???
","Have just watched this film and have to say I don't really understand how so many people can say this is a poor film. OK the script isn't the best in the world but it certainly isn't a disaster. I actually think that the ones who have rated this as low just don't understand the film or won't accept it for what it is.I think Sucker Punch is a pretty cool idea with its layered stories, i.e. the reality and the fantasies within it. We only get to see the reality at the start and end of the film whilst the fantasies that are played out tell us what happens in between. It isn't that confusing really and obviously given that this is all about what goes on in a persons imagination then there doesn't have to be any rules. That's why in the deepest fantasy when the girls are attempting to acquire the four items there are dragons and clockwork Nazis's in there. All in all it is what it is; a sci-fi, CGI, fantasy film with tons of action (maybe a tad repetitive), hot looking babes, a decent enough story and acting which won't win any Oscars but isn't that bad really. Oh and yes the music is quite loud!!",8,16,29,25 June 2011
