Captain Phillips," Great...could be better
","Here's my out-take: The Ship is attacked by pirates, and so the crew...armed of course (because guns are not evil) Shoots every one of the Somali pirates through the head. The pirates boat is then sold at auction and the Captain and crew split the profit. The film lasts 15 minutes, and then the credits roll. The End And so because my editorial has to contain 10 lines... The Captain and crew could be armed with ...sayyyy...hmmm...portable mini guns...yeah. And deck mounted 20 mm cannons...sounds great. Then when the Somali's are shot through the head, you could have a slow motion showing their heads explode (get Wes Cravens involved)...and have the movie last 20 minutes...then roll the credits. Show it in all those third world outhouses from which the real pirates come from free of charge. Smoke em if you got them!",8,0,1,1 January 2014
