It," Enjoyable!
","I, for one, really liked this movie. I'm very glad that they DID NOT even attempt to RE~make this movie verbatim! Because of this I was really able to enjoy THIS version of it. I also liked how we got a bit more character depth as well even considering the Horror movie 'cliche's'. Unfortunately, over the years our scary movies have veered off the path of 'eerie, spooky nail~biting' thrills to a lot more CG & what they term 'torture~GORE' to make their statements. In reality the simplest things can totally make or break a film of any genre'!",8,0,0,28 December 2017
