National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A theme park ride is not a movie
","I have nothing against undemanding entertainment. I didn't see the first film in this series, and I sure as hell won't be going to see any subsequent ones. For anyone familiar with the oeuvre of Daffy Duck, there is a clear analogy here. Remember 'The Scarlet Pumpernickel'? Well there Daffy is in the process of selling the idea of a movie to an obtuse and artless film producer. But when all is done, the producer just wants more spectacle and more violence and more plot twists and... (you get the idea). So it is with NT-BOS. Quite probably, in the first place, there was a reasonable film about a guy's attempts to unravel a mystery regarding Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Might have been entertaining. Might have even encouraged a modicum of cerebral activity. However, some crass producer/studio exec stepped in and wanted more more more of the stuff of multi-million dollar production values and less, less, less character development and narrative logic.The result is a complete mess in which we care not one jot for the future and safety of the characters because they have not been properly presented to us. We are only hazily aware what is going on because the filmmakers mistake speed for pace. And at the end of the film we have not experienced the ride that we were hoping for because someone didn't understand the truth that in the cinema, not enough is highly preferable to too much.",4,3,7,31 January 2008
The New World," Prepare yourself for something spiritual
","OK, I'm a massive admirer of Terrence Malick. I think he is the greatest living filmmaker. His films touch part of my psyche that are left unmoved by any other filmmaker. But... Nothing, repeat NOTHING prepared me for the sensory explosion that is The New World. I had been following the production for over 18 months, watching the trailer online... counting the days... But I was worried. Some suggestions that Malick have over-reached himself, was self-indulgent... And Malick's style of cinema is so fragile, it could fall apart. So with optimism, but trepidation I took the plunge... and - oh joy, oh bliss, this is truly heaven. Why is it so wonderful? The only word I can give is that it, unlike any film that I have seen since the death of Bresson (except, maybe, Flowers of Shanghai), is deeply, deeply spiritual. We have familiar Malick motifs - the wind on the grass, the shots of the sky reflected in water from The Thin Red Line - but here that take on a completely new and more satisfying meaning, for Malick's concern is with man in his purest communion with nature. The 'naturals' are precisely that - at one with nature. Malick uses his poetic imagery to set our senses aglow with the sheer wonder and of purity of the indigenous lifestyle. This is cinema at the level of what I can only term 'super-expression' - imagery communicates complex interaction between things and the way our senses perceive them, but it does so at an incredibly elevated level. The most remarkable thing for the casual viewer is how much Malick manages to express complex and wonderful things completely without dialogue. John Smith (Colin Farrell) barely speaks to his own people, let alone his indigenous captors. Yet we sense what he is thinking through Malick's absolutely magnificent use of imagery and sound.There are other motifs. People hold hands. They express themselves through their breathing. And, yet again, Malick has found a wonderful vehicle for his vision in the form of Q'Orianka Kilcher. Her screen presence and the range of emotions that she suggests with so little dialogue is little short of miraculous.For people who love the cinema not just on the basis of the quality of the stories that it tells, but the manner in which it tells them, this must be one of the films of the decade. Many people have said that the cinema is like a language, but that is to belittle it. It is not like A language, it is simply like language itself. And just as there are many languages, there are many cinemas - that is forms of cinema. And in each language there are masters of the language who excel in expressing themselves in poetry and in prose. In English we had Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde. Now, in 'poetic cinema' at a higher level even than Stan Brakhage, we have Terrence Malick. Yes, The New World is THAT good. See it. See it. See it.",10,5,11,27 January 2006
Gravity," Massively over-rated
","Don't get me wrong, it's not worthless, but like 'Children of Men' and unlike 'Y Tu Mama Tambien' it fails at a simple level of being convincing over it's entire length. I really don't mind when films make scientific gaffes, but this film simply changes situations that it has, itself defined when they prevent arriving at an artificial and totally improbable happy ending. When one exits form a cinema and reflects on the film, one shouldn't feel cheated at a level of logic, with spectacular technical effects being used to mask the logical inconsistencies. The use of the fire extinguisher was clever, however. For some cheap temporary thrills and a glimpse into the psychology of astronauts, fine, for anything else, forget it.",6,21,37,14 December 2013
To Be or Not to Be," One of the great romantic/satirical comedies of all time
","There is a famous review of this film by the late Sunday Times critic, Dilys Powell which begins 'Is the joke funny?'... what Miss Powell was getting at was that, given the horror of the Holocaust, it is appropriate to laugh at the Nazis. The answer is, ultimately, irrelevant to the viewing of this modest masterpiece.Lubitsch was, by this time, coming to the end of an exquisite career that defined the nature of sophistication in 'light' cinema. 'To Be or Not To Be' skips lightly over all of the minefield of a subject like this and it is difficult or impossible to think of any other filmmaker who might have managed it (if you look at Mel Brooks' limp remake, you can see why).In 1996, I presented a massive season of 'the greatest' films in Belfast for the centenary of cinema - 250 titles in 9 months. Of all of them, this was the film which got the greatest ovation - about 5 minutes with a nearly full house standing and applauding! They may have applauded for many reasons, but here are certainly some of them...The very complicated narrative is presented virtually flawlessly and the comedy is never allowed to hold up the narrative. The principle actors - Carole Lombard (breathtakingly beautiful) and Jack Benny in particular, but many of the supporting cast as well - throw themselves into the affair with a gusto that is completely infectious. Apart from the satirical aspect of the story and the way in which Hitler and the Nazis are mercilessly ridiculed for their authoritarianism and the fear which is their only motivator, the film pokes gentle fun at the vanity of actors in a warm and happy manner. Finally, and most important, is the notion of farce. Farce rarely works in the cinema, but here it does, and in the grand manner - just look at how many times the situation regarding Professor Siletsky changes profoundly during the film - it is dizzying - yet the characters manage to come up with (often self-defeating or inappropriate) schemes on every occasion.This is a wonderful work that, I have no hesitation in saying, is absolutely vital for anyone who wants to really understand the glory of the cinema. But to answer Dilys Powell's question... yes, the joke is deliriously funny.",10,96,145,20 November 2005
The Birth of a Nation," The spring from which the glory of the cinema flows
","The glory of 'Birth of a Nation' is plain to see for anyone with open eyes and mind. To fully appreciate it, it is necessary to realise the exceptionally primitive level of film grammar at the time.Before BOAN, 'expression' in the cinema was almost entirely restricted to grotesque over-acting. 'Structure' didn't exist. 'Mise en scene' was haphazard and not recognised as a part of the film-maker's art. Above all, Griffith introduced the concept of scale into the cinema, whereby it (the cinema) could represent a world that stretched in a continuum from the food on a dinner plate to the movement of great armies.That is its achievement - a massive one by ANY comparison, and I cannot think of a single work of art in any art form - save perhaps Homer's Illiad - that has single-handedly defined the medium so profoundly as this.What is so tragic, in a modern context is that this towering work has become a punch-bag for the ignorant and prejudiced, whose repellent moral and political certainties will, in fifty or a hundred or five hundred or a thousand years be consigned to the dustbin of history while this great masterpiece will shine as a beacon as long as our species appreciates the glory of its cultural apogee - CINEMA!!!",10,4,13,1 December 2003
Brokeback Mountain," A profound disappointment
","Ang Lee is one of a triumvirate (with Hsiao-hsien Hou, and Edward Yang) of Chinese directors who are among contemporary cinema's greatest assets. I have loved most of his previous films to exasperation, and so it was with great - perhaps too much - expectation that I ventured into 'Brokeback Mountain'. Let me emphasise that I have not read anything by Annie Proulx, but it doesn't matter. Films, no matter what their origins, have to stand by what is on the screen, and what is on this particular screen is, in my opinion, fatally flawed by careless cinematic expression. The two central characters are noticeably and understandably inarticulate. Their outdoor lifestyles are the total inverse of those of the chattering classes that inhabit, for example, the world of Woody Allen. But in the cinema, there is a rule that says if your characters are inarticulate, then it is up to the director to give them 'visual articulateness'. If they cannot express their feelings in words, then we must be given visual pointers to their feelings. In 'The Ice Storm' - Ang Lee's masterpiece, in my opinion, this principle is adhered to with wonderful results. But here, we get grunts and manly gestures that suggest nothing. The 'bond' which ties them together as they part does not express any emotional need - they do not dream or daydream of each other, sexually or otherwise, as far as we are shown. The scene at the end of their summer on the mountain is a complete cop-out, we need to feel what they feel, and we are not invited to feel anything. Why is this film attracting so much attention (compared with Lee's better early work)? I fear it is because a film embracing gay modern cowboys is thought to be on the brave side of risquÃ©. Perhaps it will help us gain tolerance or some such desirable attribute. But it isn't cinema.",6,9,33,12 January 2006
Interstellar," What a massive disappointment
","Though I am not a Bat-person, and do not wish to become one, I have admired Christopher Nolan for his early films and 'Inception', though, with the exception of 'Insomnia', I always regarded them as, in the immortal words of Andrew Sarris 'less than meets the eye'. I do not like to call films pretentious, but with 'Memento' and 'Inception' the word certainly came to mind. They seemed shallow pretending to be deep.The same is, in my opinion, certainly true of 'Interstellar'. Yes, it carries you along for a ride, and yes the special effects are great, and yes, it might give us pause to think what will, in fact, be the destiny of our species. But, my dear Mr Nolan, surely you must realise that our species will not survive by planting American flags on distant planets. And, like 'Gravity' before it, the search for a happy ending has totally destroyed any shred of credibility of what might have gone before. The image of Cooper floating around Saturn without his spaceship, waiting to be picked up by a passing probe (just before his oxygen runs out, of course) is so ridiculous that if Stanley Kubrick were to be told that it is a respectful reference to the 'starchild' at the end of '2001', he'd punch you in the nose. 'Interstellar' - for all of its attempts to incorporate relativistic time dilation and very clever (I do not use that word in a derogatory sense) visual representation of multi-dimensional string theory towards the end, is void of any real cultural insight.The film simply extends 'The Wizard of Oz' into the space age and decides at the end that there is really somewhere better than home. It is TOSH! Great films tell us something memorable about the human condition, or the nature of cinema itself. This film, for all its quotes from Dylan Thomas does neither. It is for people who think that the word 'awesome' has some profound meaning and not, as is the case, an excuse for not finding a more appropriate and restrained reaction. Any suggestion that it deserves a Best Picture Oscar is a sad comment on the way that those awards have become debased in recent years.",6,138,299,13 November 2014
Apocalypse Now," A beautifully-structured metaphor for America in Viet Nam
","I can claim to be one of the first people to see Apocalypse Now - at the Cannes press-show - and it remains one of the most memorable filmic events of my life. The film announces its intention from the very beginning - 'This is the end...', the opening line of 'The End' by The Doors. A film that begins with that kind of irony is going to be some work, and so it is.Though based on 'Heart of Darkness', I think that the war is so brilliantly embedded in the film that its debt to Conrad is small. In fact, for me, it supersedes Conrad, as his journey is primarily metaphysical. Here we have a metaphysical journey, but one which is totally infused with the greatest of all human 'darknesses' - war.At the centre of the film is Martin Sheen's magnificent performance as Willard. Nearly everything Sheen has done has been wonderful, but here he is as close to perfect as we can expect from an actor - making sense of even his totally 'fou' opening scene.Then there is the structure of the characters. The occupants of the boat are basically a cross-section of American society - hailing from the 'four corners' of the country - Chief Phillips comes from the north - Chicago, Chef from the south, Lance isfrom the west coast, and 'Clean' from the east. And Willard, he is from Iowa - in the heart of the continent. Here the film is showing us that the entire nation was involved in the war.So who do we thank for Apocalypse Now's wonders? My own inclination is to give, perhaps, the lion's share of the credit to John Milius - the allegoric structure of the film is also not far from the methods of 'Big Wednesday'.Are there problems? Yes. Sometimes it goes over the top - I think the Kilgore surfing scene is made more of than was necessary, the whole war is lunacy without underscoring it quite so firmly. Similarly the Playboy Bunnies sequence is also grotesque. I do not deny that value of humour in such an allegory, but I am a little uneasy about the glib way in which it is introduced.And the sense of impending doom is magnificently presented, with scenes like the encounter with the tiger resonating with all of the major primal fears of our species. (Does the tiger itself have a symbolic function? It is an interesting speculation.) As the boat approaches Kurtz' camp, the horrors simply expand and deepen. To my mind, Kurtz is being represented as that part of the human psyche that rejects rationality, and that is exactly the psyche that embraces war.Finally Willard succeeds in his mission, but at what cost...This is, as I said, some film.Oh, yes. Marlon Brando plays Colonel Kurtz and gives him a depth and complexity that would have totally escaped lesser actors.",9,1,2,28 September 2005
Spider-Man," Superior hokum
","I was attracted to Spider-Man, not by the hype - or even the names of Sam Raimi and the brilliant Tobey Maguire - but the most brilliant trailer since Titanic.  How did it measure up???Let's get one thing out of the way... there is little if any philosophical depth to the movie.  But on a stylistic level, Raimi and his collaborators have done a very good job both of establishing a couple of fine central characters and reproducing on film the zip-zap highly accelerated narrative structure of the original comics.(And doubtless Stan Lee must and should take come considerable credit for that).  There are some lovely scene transitions that bring thematic echoes along with narrative economy, and the scene in which Parker realises the nature of his new-found powers is a model of emotional gear-change in modern cinema.Finally (leave the best to last), Maguire is magnificent - arguably his best role since the glorious Ice Storm.  No cinephile should feel embarrassed to see this film - but keep your eye on the style and don't expect too much in the content.",8,0,0,27 May 2002
Million Dollar Baby," As deep as the ocean...
","Though many claim that 'Unforgiven' is a masterpiece, Clint Eastwood has never quite managed to get there for me. But this is finally it. Using a story bordering on the clichéd he has plumbed the depth of the human soul in a totally unforgettable film.Many great works of narrative art have structuring absences. Here we have the absent daughter whose loss has defined the life of Frankie Dunn. In a moment of unforced but powerful emotion, we see a shoebox full of returned letters. This defines the yawning emotional chasm at the centre of Frankie's life.The joy this wonderful film gives us for its central section is precisely the joy of filling that chasm with the love and closeness to his, initially, unwanted protégé, Maggie Fitzgerald. The three lives at the centre of the film, Frankie, Scrap and Maggie live, essentially, solitary existences, and Eastwood uses a leisurely approach to character development that only very gradually reveals the pain and pride of Frankie, the regret and loyalty of Scrap and the feisty determination of Maggie. But it is this slowly-paced, methodical and austere approach that makes the film so powerful. It goes in slow - but very, very deep.We have seen the rise of great boxing champions many, many times in the cinema... but this is, for me, the greatest of them all (and I am not forgetting 'Raging Bull', because it is not, ultimately about boxing. Frankie says it at the beginning of the film. 'Boxing is about respect - keeping it for yourself and taking it away from your opponent'. And so, when Frankie's agonising moral dilemma is forced upon him, he has only one possible course of action.So that is what the film is about: self-respect, and by the end both central characters, Frankie and Maggie, have it in the most tragic and ironic manner imaginable - her by her death, him by losing the one thing that made his life worth living.Anyone looking for the best film of the year doesn't need to even think about anything beyond this luminous masterpiece.",10,2,4,2 February 2005
Mulholland Drive," A magnificent masterpiece
","Where would the cinema be without David Lynch?  Mulholland Drive is just the latest in what must be the most ambitious directorial career in mainstream (well, fully funded) American cinema. Lynch is the only filmmaker who seems willing to actually use what is one of the cinema's most unique features - namely the freedom to represent actions in non-cohesive space-time frames.  In this case, (trying not to spoil) the film has a very unusual relationship to the mind of one of the characters. So what we are watching is not so much what happens (or doesn't happen) as the response of one of the characters to it.Yes, Keaton has done it. Yes Bunuel (sorry about the tilde) has done it. Yes Resnais has done it... but Lynch makes it part of his universe.",9,1,2,11 March 2002
Elysium," Helplesly derivative and totally unbelievable
","I wasn't one of those that found District 9 original and compelling, but it was, for certain, much more original and compelling than this nonsense.I know only too well that Hollywood studios look for the formulaic as films made to a 'successful' (ie financially rather than culturally successful) formula are less risky than those 'on the hoof' so to speak. But one would have thought that someone, someone along the line would have said 'Hey, wait a minute' this is just a re-working of bits of 'Avatar', or 'Aren't we in 'Children of Men' territory? or 'Hey this is treading on the toes of 'Metropolis' etc.OK, to use are moderate, mediocre or great (respectively) film as a launch-pad for a new work can be justified, but 'Elysium' doesn't even seem to bother to conceal the origins of its 'inspiration'. And there's the rub (Hamlet), the film uses thematic and structural cast-offs to hide the fact that it actually lacks its own inspiration.The first fifteen or twenty minutes of the film is engaging enough, but thereafter its lack of originality, for me, at least, became increasingly irritating, as did its clumsy ways of papering over plot holes.Along with the undigested 'references', the characterisations are weak as well, with the arrival of that cliché of clichés.... the sick little girl. Pur-leeeeeease!And, oh, yes, ignoring the laws of physics is a dangerous game... 'open to space' space stations can NOT have breathable atmospheres.....",4,2,4,29 September 2013
Some Like It Hot," The greatest comedy?
","It is, of course, wonderful. The narrative is impeccable. The acting by all principals is magical. Without being flashy, the mise en scène is precise and clear. The dialogue is crisp and funny. And it has been voted the greatest comedy film of all time...But is it? Thank you Billy for this wonderful film, but I really don't think it holds a candle to some of the great works of Chaplin or Keaton. It is not as funny as the finest works of the Marx Bros.No, not the greatest comedy, but perhaps, yes, perhaps the most entertaining comedy of the cinema. It is the kind of film where you inwardly give a little squeal of pleasure as each unlikely twist of the plot falls into place. When Jerry refers to men as 'dirty beasts' it sends a shiver of pleasure down the spine with utter certainty. This is situation comedy that makes 'Friends' look like Mother Courage. The real art in this farce-like structure is to keep all of the complications bubbling along and Wilder & Diamond do this just about perfectly.So now I feel mean-spirited for not praising this lovely film more fulsomely. It's just that Keaton, and, even more so, Chaplin knew that comedy was serious stuff. Some Like It Hot isn't serious, just seriously and gleefully entertaining.",10,4,6,2 March 2005
When Harry Met Sally...," The map of the human heart...
","Love doesn't come in a minute, Sometimes it doesn't come at all I only know that when I'm in it It isn't silly, no, it isn't silly, love isn't silly at all.These words, from Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs', seem to me to be a very accurate description of the theme of 'When Harry Met Sally'. This iconic romantic comedy, written by Nora Ephron, is, for me, one of the most insightful comments on the place of love in the post-60s world. It charts the way that acquaintance can turn into friendship and then into love.Harry (Billy Crystal) encounters Sally (Meg Ryan) on a long car journey during which they both seem to decide that the other is obnoxious in one way or another. Their path to love is funny, totally engaging and ultimately unforgettable.One of the greatest - no THE greatest - characteristic of the cinema is its ability to access our deepest emotions. How many times do we weep cathartically in our normal lives - most of us, not many. Yet there are dozens of films that induce just this kind of reaction. How many times do we laugh so much that we ache - very rarely outside a cinema, but often within. How many times are we so scared that we cannot move - almost never in life, but often in the cinema. And these emotions cannot be accessed in the same way through any other art.And there are laughs and tears galore in 'When Harry Met Sally'. Why? Because we really *care* for these kooky characters, and the love that they find has a kind of purity that our loves struggle to emulate. For some people (and I feel sorry for them) films that induce a warm feeling of pleasure are sentimental and worthless. They should avoid this film as it might undermine their sterile cynicism. But if you trust your emotions and regard them as your greatest asset, 'When Harry Met Sally' will be one of the most worthwhile films of the modern era.",9,0,0,5 July 2007
A Hard Day's Night," Fab four fairly fine
","I remember the thrill of seeing this on its first release in my home town. It was just so FREE. It looked like it was made up as they were making it (it was). The Beatles clearly didn't give a toss about the result and they didn't try to conceal themselves behind a meaningless plot, they sat on top of it.If anyone wanted to know when the Sixties started to swing, I'd say it was at the point early in this film where they are in a press reception and a journalist asks John 'How did you find America?' - his response 'Turn left at Greenland!'. That's it. England swung.Here we have alienation, precious television directors, Steptoe Senoir as Paul's 'other' grandfather and, above all, a sense that nothing - absolutely nothing - matters other than the music.I am not a Beatles nut, and clearly it is only moderate cinema, but it is fun and it is subversive, and that's enough for me right now.",8,1,1,2 March 2005
The Wolf of Wall Street," Meaningless catalogue of grotesques
","I have seen thousands of films in my life, but I cannot remember one in which every single character was a disgusting example of the worst elements of humanity. At last I have found one. Is this the 'truth' about Wall Street? I have no idea, but it corresponds almost exactly with my own beliefs. So I should like it? Right? It panders to my prejudices. It tells 'the truth'.Oh, no. That is not what makes for great cinema. Great cinema surprises you, it opens new vistas, it invites one to question things that had been assumed.All of Scorsese's films - even since 'The Big Shave' - have featured characters who exhibit aspects of masochism, or self-destruction. In 'The Wolf of Wall Street' it is moral masochism writ large that is on display. That is not necessarily a problem, but this is a film without a moral compass. If it could be reasonably described as a 'cautionary tale', it might have some merit. But it isn't, because the film is seen through the eyes of a human cockroach.Scorsese knows the cinema well. He knows that the audience will identify with, and try to rationalise the actions of, the character who is on- screen for the most of the time. Thus it has been since the cinema began. And, without a shadow of a doubt, an enormous number of people whose own personal avarice is well advanced, will see the film and rationalise it as a series of errors of judgement by the eponymous Jordan Belfort.Of course, there are some positives - the visual catch-line to Jordan's miraculously fortunate drive while stoned with his drugs raises a laugh, and certain ironies emerge in the final quarter of the film, but it is Jordan's story and it is clear that he thinks he was justified and just made mistakes (viz the final scene).If it were possible to get all of the right-wing finance ministers from around the world and lock them in a cinema that showed this non-stop for a few weeks, it might just change their mind about the thrust of economic policy that encourages unbridled avarice, but that is a vain hope.In the end we see Jordan all set to make the same mistakes in another territory. He evidently hadn't learnt a thing. And what is a thousand times worse is that he had evidently benefited financially from the film - it being based on his own book.People who know me and my philosophical approach to cinema will probably find this review strange. In general, I detest the idea of judging the moral stance of a film. But this film doesn't, it seems to me, take a moral stance in a story that concerns itself with a subject that most blights the lives of the majority of our species - inequality, and one man's efforts to increase it. And it doesn't provide us with psychological or cinematic insight into its subject either... the film is inhabited by a bunch of grotesques that are barely human in their blind avarice.Avarice is the most evil of the seven deadly sins, because it leads to all of the others. This is not something which emerges from either this film's form or content.",5,3,6,3 February 2014
Blade Runner," A messy film...
","If anyone asks me to name a dirty movie, I always think of Blade Runner first.  The plot is fine, the acting given that touch of class guaranteed by Ford, but the sheer messiness of the filmed environment just gets in the way of whatever we are meant to make of the theme.So why do so many people think it's great???",5,2,9,11 March 2002
Signs," 70% Tosh
","As a passionate cinephile I get intensely annoyed when modern directors steal the ideas, situations etc., from great, and even not so great films from the past. 'Signs' is, in effect, little more than 'War of the Worlds' re-couched in a family environment that is reminiscent of 'The Birds' with a splash of 'The Wizard of Oz' thrown in. One has the idea that M Night Shymalan might claim that is film is some kind of homage to these films, but that is nonsense. It is a load of tosh (English slang for rubbish), that is interesting, up to a point, all the time it is 'about' crop circles, and disintegrates into ridicule when it becomes an apocalyptic vision. 'The Sixth Sense' was clever, well-constructed and thoughtful. This film is none of those.",4,4,7,13 November 2014
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Still seems that Woody is running on empty....
","Nothing that Woody Allen does in the rest of his career is going to alter that fact that he will be regarded as one of the greatest American directors of all time - one of a mere handful who have presented a unique world-view in their films.... However, our wonderful, wonderful Woody has seemed to be on a decline for some time... certainly since 'Deconstructing Harry' and perhaps before...And yet every new Woody movie contains real insight into the human condition, it's just that he doesn't seem to be bothered to wrap them up in the near perfect packages that we saw in 'Manhattan', 'Hannah' and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'.Here we have a case in point. Love and responsibility is the subject - it is in all of Woody's best films. Vicky is conventional and reserved, Cristina is flighty and adventurous... But hey! Cupid can soon start turning things around...It was one of the great disappointments of the latter half of Fellini's career that, for the most part - even just after 'Giulietta degli Spiriti' - he seemed to forget about the rigour of script-writing and narrative expression. It was as if her was saying 'people will come to see a Fellini film even if I don't bother my head too much.' It was the same with Godard - only for very different reasons. I wonder if, perhaps, Woody has got tired of all of the effort needed to hone his ideas into the near-perfect packages of earlier times. It could be that the title of his new film 'Whatever Works' - is a signal that the search for perfection has been replaced for the search for 'whatever works'.As has been noted in an interesting thread on the board for this film, one of the main problems with this film is the narration. This is strange, as Woody can turn voice-over narration into pure gold (think of his poignant narration for 'Annie Hall'), perhaps, the real problem is that it isn't Woody who is narrating... it is some faceless narrator with a smug voice.For me Woody is the comic Shakespeare of our age. I do so hope that he has a 'Winter's Tale' or a 'The Tempest' left in him... Regrettably this isn't it... even though it knocks spots off the awful 'Cassandra's Dream'.",8,2,7,17 December 2008
Rear Window," Exquisite cinema
","I just got back from seeing 'Rear Window' in a cinema. It's probably the tenth time or so I have seen it 'full size'. Every time I am captivated by, above all else, the 'editing'. I put the word in quotes because it is not the 'classical' aspects of editing - rhythm etc., that I see, but the way in which Hitchcock cuts each scene up into detailing shots which, in turn, dovetail together to create a logical picture.This is yet another example of the Master giving us a lesson in film theory. LB is playing Sherlock Holmes. He is adding small facts together to make bigger understandings. So Hitch uses the characteristic of montage discovered by Kuleshov in the early days of post-revolutionary Russia to take us through the process. It is magical.But it wouldn't be so magical were it not for Hitch's wonderful characters - Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, the composer and so on. And they also contribute to this master-class in stylistics as each is given just enough screen-time to define their place in the drama.And finally, and finally, and finally... there is Grace Kelly - the most beautiful, graceful, feminine star ever to light up our lives. And how are we introduced to her? She kisses us! Heart stops.Maybe Hitchcock really was the greatest director ever. And there is nobody, nobody currently making films at this level of sheer genius.Star Wars? Godfather? They are not in the same galaxy as this cinematic wonder.",10,0,1,15 April 2008
Gangs of New York," Too short by half
","From its opening vision of hell to its final vision of heaven (almost), Gangs of New York does so much right that it is almost unbelievable that it fails to deliver emotionally. Using Hitchcock's dictum that 'The better the villain, the better the film', it deserves to be a matchless masterpiece as Daniel Day-Lewis monumentalises Bill the Butcher into the embodiment of corrupt evil. But still, it doesn't gel, and, in the words of the unfortunate Arbogast, 'If it don't gel, it ain't aspic'.My best guess as to the relative, and I stress *relative* failure of this wonderful undertaking is that the much-vaunted rift between Scorsese and his producers resulted in cutting that amounted to lobotomy. Of course they must leave in the set pieces that cost the millions, so let's just remove the character development that slows it up...Fools!When (and if - I hope) the director's cut emerges (theatrically PLEASE!!! not reduced to postage stamp size), we must surely get much more of Cameron Diaz and some of the minor characters who started out vital and then disappeared...Clearly the work of a fine filmmaker, it just can't seem to sustain the breadth in 'only' three hours...Keep watching the masterpieces...

Coach Carter," 'Hoosiers' meets 'Stand and Deliver'
","Sports films always at least have the advantage that artificial drama can always be conjured up from the uncertainty of the outcome of a particular sporting event. Films set in under-privileged neighbourhoods have the advantage that they are able to show us that there is good in all of us and we can overcome adversity, if only we try hard enough.Films that are both set in the ghetto and about sporting endeavour have, thus, two advantages. 'Coach Carter' milks its two advantages and turns out to be a highly entertaining, if unoriginal, pot-boiler. Jackson is fine as the tough-nut 'made good' former street kid given the job of beating a bunch of apparent no-hoper school basketball players into shape. We get all of the social stuff... drugs, unwanted pregnancies, academic under-achievement. That's par for the course.We also get some excellent sidebar characters, like a realist head-mistress who turns idealist, and a massively over-weight mother who dominates her tough-nut son.The film is, finally, just an amalgam of 'Hoosiers' (1986) and 'Stand and Deliver' (1988) - both substantially superior films. It is, however, worth the price of admission for the ride.",6,0,2,21 January 2005
