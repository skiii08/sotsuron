Requiem for a Dream," Excellent Movie
","I had anticipated seeing this movie about a year and a half ago when I found out about it because Marlon Wayans,my favorite actor, is in it.  Not to say that he gave the top performance of the movie, as to me Mrs. Burstyn did that, but I have always respected him as an actual actor as opposed to just a funny guy used for comic relief.  I'm really glad to see that maybe now others will respect him as an actor as I do. Now that I've given props to my man Marlon, I would like to say that Requiem for a Dream is one of the best, if not the best movie I have ever seen and it is now one of my favorites. I had read so much about how graphic the movie was before I saw it that it really didn't seem too graphic to me other than the last Connelly scene. She gets major respect as an actress for what she did as do all the actors of the cast.  I will stop here because I think my point has been made. Great director.  Great cast. Great movie.  Check it out. 10 out of 10.",10,0,0,2 January 2001
Requiem for a Dream," You Think You Know
","I have already posted a comment praising this movie.  This comment is directed toward all who have commented negatively about the film.  I am the first to say that everyone is entitled to their opinion, as I believe this is true.  However, many people have said that this is a bad movie because the cinematography is unoriginal.  In case you all have not looked at the trivia section of this movie, it contains over 2000 cuts, as the average movie contains around 700.  Also, some people said this movie is unrealistic.  I am willing to put my life on the line and bet that 99 percent of those who said that have never been a heroin addict, let alone tried the drug.  I have never used drugs, but I have friends who have(Even one who lost his life this summer because he jumped out of a car under the influence of speed).  None of us know what it is like to be drug addicts. And in case some of you don't know, screenwriters do usually research things before they write about them, as do actors before they portray something. With this said, I would like to say once more that I respect everyone's opinion, but the reasons for those opinions may not be solid.",10,1,2,6 January 2001
Scary Movie 2," Hilarious
","Scary Movie 2 is hilarious.  There's one thing that I can't seem to understand, if someone didn't like Scary Movie then why would they go see Scary Movie 2.  They couldn't have thought that Marlon and Shawn Wayans were going to change the writing style they used on a movie that grossed well over 200 million dollars.  Anyway, the movie was funny.  I must say that I did like the first better, but I still thought this one was hilarious. Marlon Wayans is my favorite actor and I am a huge fan of the entire Wayans family.  Although I don't believe that any type of comedy is better than another, if I were to follow these beliefs then I would have to conclude that Keenan, Marlon, and Shawn are just very versatile.  Keenan Ivory Wayans wrote and produced I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, a spoof of blaxploitation films. This movie received rave reviews and didn't have 'toilet humor' as many people like to call it.  Marlon and Shawn wrote and produced Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, which critically was not as successful as Keenan's spoof, but was a huge hit with fans and had very little 'toilet humor.'  Last summer the brothers Wayans wrote Scary Movie and mastered gross-out humor in the spoof.  They did it again this summer.  Perhaps many of the jokes in Scary Movie 2 are taken from scenes or even movies that many people might not remember, but the movie is still hilarious.  Straight up, if you didn't like the first one, don't go see the sequel expecting something totally different.  If you liked the first one and didn't enjoy the second, I supposed I can understand.  I give it a 10 because it did its job which was to make me laugh.  One final note, to anyone who says Marlon Wayans isn't talented, go out and rent Requiem for a Dream.",10,1,3,7 July 2001
Save the Last Dance," Excellent Film
","I just saw Save the Last Dance and I loved it.  Julia Stiles is now one of my favorite actresses.  She and Sean Patrick Thomas share a chemistry that makes every scene seem so real.  I also enjoyed the performances of Fredro Starr and the rest of the cast.  I am definately going to buy this movie when it comes out on DVD. Despite what others might say and have said, MTV makes great films(The Wood is one of my top three, and I loved Varsity Blues and Can't Hardly Wait). Anyway, I recommend this movie.  10 out of 10.",Null,3,7,18 January 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Not a dull moment throughout
","When watching this film in the theater, not once did I find myself waiting for something exciting to happen because there was always something good going on, even if it wasn't action.  The movie was extremely action packed and had a good storyline.  I think all the cast gave good performances.  I don't care what anyone says about the movie, I thought it was tight.  The story was great, the action was intense, and it kept me interested.  I give it a 10.",10,1,2,18 June 2000
