Walk the Line," Great movie, but very similar to Ray
","First off, let me state that I am NOT a fan of Johnny Cash. I am also NOT a fan of Reese Witherspoon. I do like J. Phoenix however, and that is why I went to see this film. I was especially eager to see/hear how he pulled off his role since he played guitar and did the singing.I was not disappointed! Recently I've gotten fed up with how 'trendy' listening to Johnny Cash has become. I have a friend in a punk rock band, and when I visited him last, he was playing J.C. Since my friend is from Arkansas, I figured I'd let it slide. But, after hearing the J.C. versions of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails songs on the radio vs. their own renditions, I had had enough. I made a conscious decision to not listen to Johnny Cash.Well, during the movie I found myself tapping my feet, and wondering if I should get a greatest hits album, or pick up a few of his better albums. I have yet to buy a Cash album, but this movie was so good, I think I may end my boycott of listening to Johnny Cash. I do hope however, that the radio station I listen to plays the DM and NIN versions of the songs, and not Cash's versions.I couldn't help but notice how similar this movie was to Ray. Not to take anything away from the casts' performances, but this is basically Ray w/a white cast. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the movie, it was just told in a very similar manner to Ray.Not being a Reese Witherspoon fan, I normally don't pay much attention to her. But she was incredible in her role as June Carter. She was cute, bubbly, funny, and so believable, I forgot it was her.Mr. Phoenix was amazing as Mr. Cash. I never forgot that it was J. P, but he was fantastic. He did an incredible job w/both the singing and the guitar playing.If Jamie Foxx deserved the Oscar for Ray, Mr. Phoenix deserves it for his role as Johnny Cash.",8,0,1,29 November 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not as bad as I and II, but not good either
","The first 45 minutes of this video went by painfully slow. The wife and I kept looking at each other in disbelief. Neither of us could believe how bad the acting and dialog was.The end of the movie was much better than the beginning, but could have been much, much, better. Anakin's turn toward the dark side was not covered as much as it should have been, and far too much time was devoted to CGI. Most of the movie looked like a video game.The feel of the original three films was lost, and I feel that it is because of the use of the digital cameras partially, but mostly because of the reliance on CGI. This CGI footage would make an awesome video game, but as far as movies go, it just doesn't look real enough.Do yourself a favor if you haven't seen this film yet. Either skip it all together, or borrow someone's DVD.",3,2,5,28 November 2005
Fantastic Four," no character development, poor direction, not a good movie
","I have never been a fan of comic books, but have enjoyed the movies based on comic book characters. The wife and I really enjoyed X-men, X-men II, Spiderman, and 3 of 5 of the Batman movies. Now, I had no expectations going into this movie. I did not know the story, and could not be disappointed by a lack of being true to the comic. If it was true or not, I don't know.On casting: Jessica Alba is what, 24? She is supposed to be the same age as the other MIT grads who look as if they are in their late 30's if not into their 40's? I just didn't buy it. I am not a huge fan of hers anyway. Not that she did a bad job, it is just that she was not the right choice for this role.Character development: It didn't exist. Sure there were some attempts to tell the audience about the characters, but not enough time was spent getting you to know them or even care about them. I think each person got one sentence about their past. For instance Johnny getting kicked out of NASA for trying to smuggle models aboard a flight simulator. That is about all there was introducing his character. Von Doom got three scenes devoted to his character, and it still wasn't enough.Directing: I have no experience making movies, just a fan for a long time. Anyway, I'd say that there were too many plot holes to make this a good movie, but it is hard to find the plot. Maybe I fell asleep, but how do people walk around a space station like they are walking on earth? Did I miss the part about artificial gravity? They may have mentioned it, but I don't remember. They could have, and should have added at least another 20 minutes to this film in order to answer some obvious questions that the directing brings up, and to develop the characters.Overall: I think this film was made to show of Alba's body in a tight outfit and to demonstrate special effects. I know I am in the minority, but she doesn't do anything for me. There are other types of movies out there (adult) that I'd watch if I wanted to see a woman showing off her body.I left this movie wishing I had the 45 minutes and my money back. I know the movie is longer than 45 minutes, it is just short. I would wait for this to come to the rental store, or to cable/sat before I watched it. I really can't believe the box office numbers for this movie. But, I was one of the people out there on the opening weekend, so I contributed.",4,5,10,12 July 2005
