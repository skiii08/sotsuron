Sucker Punch," Possibly the worst film ever created
","It is possible that this is the worst film has ever been made. It is almost certainly the worst film I have ever seen. Its difficult to spend the required 10 lines to describe this film because the script could probably be written in that little text. As far as I can tell this film is designed to appeal to the video game playing teenage boy who cant get a girl friend. The film shoves some nice looking girls in some stockings, give them guns and get them to shoot stuff. In principle this sounds fun but then they ruin the boy pleasing element by getting them to cry quite a lot, and the action bit is nothing particularly special anyway. Tedious.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, its two hours of my life I will never see back. Save your money and watch the Matrix on DVD instead.",1,8,16,14 April 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Fun but a bit disappointing
","I don't know what it is about the film industry at present but there appears to be a general effort to 'cash in' on good story ideas by dragging sequels out into two films. We see it often where they produce a good and successful film (the Matrix, Back to the future, etc) and then decide to create a double bill sequel. The trouble is that they don't really have enough story to make a second and third film so they have to pad out the script with dull and irrelevant scenes.Sadly Pirates 2 falls inside this category. Sections of the film are outstanding with Mr Depp's character of Captain Jack Sparrow probably rating as my favourite comedy character I have seen in an film. It also illustrates what a superb and versatile actor he is. Other sections of the film you just cant wait for them to be over because they just don't add anything to the story and arn't very interesting to watch.Sadly the film is let down badly by a script that has just been stretched too thinly over the two sequels and the result is a film that starts well but looses its pace and becomes a little dull. My least favourite part of these 'two parter sequels' is that we have no ending. The film just sort of stops with out any conclusion.In conclusion I would describe this as half a film who's quality will depend heavily on how the third film concludes the story. It is worth a watch but I would save it for the half price ticket day at the cinema or perhaps even a video rental just before the third comes out. It is just not a patch on the first film.",6,2,5,9 July 2006
