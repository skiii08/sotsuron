It," Slow and campy
","Slow moving and the soundtrack is a dead giveaway for any impending scares. The music gets about four times louder and tries to sound creepy right before a planned scare and runes the whole thing. The special effects either look like they're from a b rated horror film or they are over the top cgi, so they are either comical or just over done.",5,1,1,29 November 2019
Us," Tries to be so different fails at being good
","The best way to describe this is that it's a movie version of a Jackson Pollock painting, some think it's groundbreaking and fantastic and others think it tries so hard to be groundbreaking that it misses the point of being good. It's a slasher flick attempting to be a psychological thriller that lasts two hours. It almost saves itself with the big reveal at the end and then keeps going to have a bigger reveal and completely ruins itself.",3,1,3,15 July 2019
Ted," Cliche romantic comedy + talking bear
","This movie has less depth and the jokes fall more flat than a comic strip from the newspaper. It is the overkill equation of man and women are dating, man has a problem and women gives ultimatum: of change or we're done, then predicable conflict and simple base bad jokes and the ending required for it to be a 'romantic' comedy. As much as you'd think the talking teddy bear would give it a unique fun twist if anything it only makes it more pathetic.",1,2,3,10 January 2020
Aquaman," It's part a finding yourself and part action movie
","It is a really well done film that has layers, sorry to all the haters that clearly weren't paying attention. Part of it is about Arthur's birth and childhood and then about him finding out he is the prince of Atlantis and then becoming Aquaman. The haters say he is a mindless thug, ignoring the fact that he can speak Japanese and has an in-depth knowledge of the history of the Roman Empire. He did not grow up in Atlantis so when he arrives there is a lot he doesn't know, because it's like him traveling to a country he has never been before. His female companion is as much as a historian as she is a guide, because again he didn't grow up in Atlantis he doesn't know the legends and laws. Despite what the haters say the movie is less of a social commentary about polluting the oceans as it is about racism. Which is evident by the comments about him coming from many.It really is a story about forging your own destiny while staying true to your heritage and ignoring what the negative people, it shows being a hero is about more than superhuman powers.",10,0,5,15 February 2020
Alien," Why is Indiana Jones on a space ship?
","I carry more advanced technology around in my pocket every day than they used to make this film and it shows. In response to the defense of it was made in 79 two points, 1)then it didn't and doesn't stand the test of time as so many claim & 2)Star Trek came out in the 60s and looks more believable than this. It wasn't scary, it wasn't creepy, it wasn't thrilling. It was boring and at times laughable.",1,2,26,19 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once upon a time.. like a bedtime story will put you to sleep
","Big named actors, director, lots of money, the only thing missing was a plot line. The whole movie is set in the 60s/70s but shot in modern color wide screen high definition, which makes it loose a lot of the nostalgia magic. There's two main characters one a western actor and the other his stunt double and then for some reason the Manson family comes in. It is almost 4 hours moves as slow as a snail and seems to have no point and is a bit random.",3,3,6,4 January 2020
Joker," Interesting movie, bad portrayal of the joker
","The joker is an enigma that started 60+ years ago. When you try to adjust or add to it you are most likely going to fail. The joker was always a cartoon mafioso, the purple outfit, green hair and face paint as the cartoon aspects, where as the suit or tuxedo, guns, explosives and the lackeys are the mafioso aspects. To reduce the character to a person with psychiatric and possible intellectual disabilities diminishes the complexity and fun of the character that is the joker.Bottom line: If you're looking for a movie about a charter that has a break with reality and the following consequences it's good, if you're looking for a movie that follows the 60+ year history of the joker character in DC comics it fails.",5,7,16,12 January 2020
It Chapter Two," Better than chapter 1 but still drags with cartoon CGI
",I still want to know where is the scene that was supposed to be too scary to include in the first movie version of It that explained Pennywise's origins. The movie starts with a hate crime if killing a gay guy and includes stealing sacred objects from natives and a running hidden joke about Stephen King's writing habits. I literally stopped the movie and slept twice while watching it because it doesn't flow all that well and doesn't resolve a lot of questions. They took almost 5 hours of screen time between parts 1 & 2 and they never fully explained what Pennywise is or how it came to be or why it eats people or the 27 year cycle. Some of the CGI wasn't scary to the contrary looked like something from a children's cartoon.,5,0,0,29 November 2019
Mother!," Self indulgent, chaotic, egotistical metaphor
",A writer wrote a movie that is one giant metaphor for how much people love a writer. The movie starts out simply enough and then deteriorates into random chaos almost as if the woman is suffering from a massive psychotic break from reality. To make it worse almost every scene in the movie is a super zoomed in shot so you only see the bottom of the persons chin to the middle of their forehead. It's like a Pollock painting some seem to see ground breaking art and others see a childish attempt at being original that results in unappealing chaos.,1,3,3,30 March 2020
