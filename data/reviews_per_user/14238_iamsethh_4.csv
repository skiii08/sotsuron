Requiem for a Dream," I almost left the theater to puke
","I almost left the theater to puke, and that is praise, and it's true. I had heard good things about this, but I was not too impressed with Pi, so overall I was expecting it to be 'good' at best. But, seeing this movie was an experience unlike 'seeing a movie' had ever been before in my life. Seeing this movie is more an experience that rivals losing your virginity, attending a parent's funeral, or getting in a car accident. I almost left the theater to throw up not out of disgust (although there were a few disgusting images), but out of anxiety. I've never walked out of a movie, and almost had to leave my first one not because of how bad it was, but because of how good it was. I was sitting there thinking 'please be over.. please be over..', so that I could leave. Now that I've had a day to recover, I am going to go see it again, I should be detached just barely enough to appreciate the technique this time. I really hope that 'Batman Year One', his next project, does not turn out to be for him what 'Dune' was to David Lynch.",10,1,2,17 December 2000
Fight Club," 'Potemkin' of the 90s
","This movie is a well crafted, exciting, and ultimately thoughtless piece of propaganda, like 'Potemkin', 'Triumph of the Will' or 'Birth of a Nation'. It advances certain ideas (that we are all slaves to 'consumerism' and have no choice but to buy products advertised to us, which we must revolt against by beating people up and exploding buildings), and argues them with images rather then words. In historical context, it will be seen alongside the WTO and IMF riots and the rise of the Green Party. Like most propaganda, a closer inspection will reveal how full of hypocrisy it is - notice all the product placements.",1,13,39,4 November 2000
American Psycho," Hilarious and dark, sometimes stilted
","This movie is great, but I have a taste for mixing the hilarious with the perverse. It's great to see them transposed.. it makes the dark seem darker and the light seem lighter. This movie was generally a good adaption of the book. The book is really revolting, I had to stop reading at parts and go do something else before I could continue (and I consider myself a pretty sick guy). You really couldn't sit through the movie if it portrayed what was shown in the book. The closest movie I've seen to something like that was 'Salo: 120 days of Sodom', which didn't even come close to the violence in American Psycho (the novel). The only problem with the movie's adaption is that it left out some very telling things - like the fact that Bateman's mother is in a mental hospital, and the episode where he murders an ex-gf, which further sketches out his hostility towards women.",8,0,0,16 April 2000
Schindler's List," Not nearly as good as it could have been
","This movie took a subject which was extremely complicated and difficult, and dumbed it down to the level that everyone except Representative Tom Coburn (OK) could understand it (he complained about the networks 'polluting the minds of our children' when it was shown on tv, because it had nudity and violence). Oscar Schindler was an anti-semite, a real anti-semite. Someone once asked him why he had done what he did, and he said something along the lines of 'if you see a dog hit by a car dying in the street, you know you're better then the dog, but you still want to help it' (he was equating Jews with dogs, placing them on the same moral level). He was also a womanizer and alcoholic. The golden ring he was given at the end of the film, in real life was later traded for a drink. This was not the same Schindler portrayed in the movie. The film attempted to show some of his 'seedy' side, I think that's what the secretary hiring scene was supposed to be, but it didn't really work, and I didn't end up thinking Oscar Schindler was that bad of a guy. This could have been a much richer film if it was about a bad person who did a good thing, which was what the historical event actually was.The film, I think, was meant to be an educational project. It was meant to teach people about the holocaust when they really didn't know much about it. As that, it succeeds. This is a movie that should be shown to middle school students when the holocaust is being studied. It brings knowledge to the masses which they otherwise would not have known about. but as art, as a movie, it just dressed itself up as a 'serious art film', while actually really dumbing down the subject. If you're already familiar with the subject matter, if you already knew genocide was bad, that Nazis were crazy, and that the holocaust was an enraging and sad event, then there's really nothing in the movie to think about. I would put this film in the same class as Man On The Moon - mediocre films that have nothing to offer beyond introducing the audience to events they may be unfamiliar with.",5,1,6,29 January 2000
