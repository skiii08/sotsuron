The Rock," Brings new meaning to the term, 'wretched garbage'.
","Unbelievably bad film. Nicholas Cage's character is required to constantly defer to Connery as Sean never lets up with the subtle insulting put downs. He even punched Cage in the stomach and poor Nick had to double over as if he had been nailed by Mike Tyson. As usual, Sean pronounces all his 's's' as if they were an 'sh', so I'm glad he didn't walk into a restaurant and ask if he could just sit anywhere. The scene where Cage has a car chase with a Ferrari was unbelievably badly directed and edited. It just seemed like a series of closeups of Cage's strained face and unrelated clips of cars in various positions. Cage shoots a huge missile point blank at one of the bad guys. Instead of going through him like a blowtorch through butter or just vaporizing him, it actually carries the guy around a hundred yards at about 30 mph before he slips off and becomes impaled on a fence. We hear him go, 'aaahhh' as he falls. Unbelievably dumb. Then, a huge bomb explodes near Cage and he is blown hundreds of feet into the air and lands in the bay, face down, unconscious. Old man Connery naturally shwims to his reshcue and shaves him. Without any form of first aid performed by Connery, we see Cage running along the shoreline with his bald, white-bearded antagonist. Connery manages to insult Cage again as soon as he regains consciousness. Ed Harris was good as the villain. Other than that, trash.",1,9,19,26 June 2012
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Nonstop Hysteria
","This movie crossed the line several times, but I couldn't stop laughing long enough to rationalize. From beginning to end, I laughed involuntarily and tears were streaming down my face. This Borat guy is absolutely nuts! The parts where he brings a plastic bag to the dinner party, walks through an antique shop, refers to his next door neighbor, wrestles,...I could go on and on . This comedy was completely original and wouldn't let up. The semi documentary format contained some unsuspecting accomplices as well as perfectly staged routines. I know there's gonna be a Borat II. This guy is the Peter Sellers of the 21st Century.",10,1,12,2 January 2007
Skyfall," James Bond...The Dark Knght
","This was the worst of all the James Bond films. He is now Batman...morose, monosyllabic, brooding. The villain, Silva, was just a reboot of The Joker with yellow hair instead of green. So here we have Silva, a flamboyantly gay villain, swaggering around with his entourage, and offing everybody. He actually took over a decrepit island crowded with ugly old buildings? Why? Then Bond has sex with women and he can't even talk right? It's not that easy,pal...and Daniel Craig looks old - white facial hair, wrinkled,creased, raisin-like skin...he's still using the Bow-Flex, though...good abs. Then,he falls 200 ft. off a train into a river, unconscious, then falls down a 200-ft. waterfall, still unconscious, with two bullet wounds in his chest and he is seen slowly sinking, eyes closed, not moving...and he lives...what is this...Monty Python?? We next see him having sex with a Turkish woman...No explanation on how he survived the drowning ordeal...I also didn't know Muslim women were so easy...Then he has sex with his fellow agent, who has no womanly curves and looks like a tan Michael Jackson...Then he has sex with a gorgeous captive Asian chick and after she gets offed by the gay villain doing a William Tell routine by missing the shot glass on top of her head and killing her...Bond says..'That's a waste of good scotch'...Bond also lets the bad guy hit man kill someone before he intervenes, the Michael Jackson agent is demoted to the new M's secretary and her name is 'Moneypenny' Why? Just to further trash the franchise?....What else? Oh,yeah - he starts driving a 50-year-old Aston Martin and the James Bond theme breaks out.......Let's face it - this movie was pure trash......just a horrible, boring, mess. Craig plays Bond as if he were a depressed mental patient.",1,5,17,14 February 2013
Spartacus," No 'Glad' in 'Gladiator'
","Great film. Kirk Douglas gave the performance of his career. Kubrick was very adept at filming Douglas's face...no joke - Kirk Douglas can convey deep feelings and moods without uttering a word and that chiseled mug of his is one powerful cinematic tool. Douglas's grimacing face, bright white teeth flashing, elicits more drama than Shakespeare ever could. When the lighting casts shadows accentuating all the angles and lines of that face and the piercing eyes.I tell ya, no other director utilized Douglas this way before or since. Kubrick was a genius. The first half of the film was filled with tension as Spartacus was tormented by the gravely-voiced trainer, Marcellus. When Spartacus finally snapped, the rebellion was swift and brutal.This came shortly after the gladiator match between Woody Strode and Douglas - the best gladiator fight ever filmed. All the conflicts and nuances of human behavior, whether from slaves or Roman gentry, seemed very authentic. Kubrick was able to depict the gathering of the slave army and how they trained and sustained themselves. Douglas was very charismatic and pulled it off well as a leader to whom thousands would follow. Olivier was flawless as the hateful Roman general, Crassus. Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons,Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov - all put in great performances. I would have liked to have seen several more sustained battles - they were few and much too brief in this film. The climactic battle scene was very powerful; I wish it had lasted longer. I also wish the film was more historically accurate - the true story of Spartacus was even more amazing and brutal. Two things that were flawed in the film were a lack of the development of some of the minor characters..they seemed like stock 1950-1960 cookie cutter characters. Also,the fake outdoor scenes filmed under a studio roof were out of place in such a spectacle - they were more suited for a TV show like Bonanza - come to think of it, this practice of having phony trees, rocks, and ground instead of actually filming outdoors ruined many TV shows and movies of the 50's and 60's. Anyway, Douglas's performance and Kubrick's direction made this film a classic. The soundtrack music was excellent - very original and it added a lot to the film.",8,3,7,2 May 2008
The Fan," Fanatical Fan Forces Fate
","Lots of this movie was good. DeNiro effectively portrays a sick man who swears violently in the presence of his young son. Patti D'Arbanville effectively plays the victimized, frustrated wife. Wesley Snipes is believable as a major league athlete. It's no secret that Rayburn's character was modeled after Barry Bonds. The Giants had recently acquired the superstar from the Pirates in 1993. There was also a jersey number conflict when Barry Bonds joined the team. He always wore number 24, but the Giants had retired that number; it having belonged to hall of famer Willie Mays. Mays, Barry's godfather, gave Bonds permission to use it, but Barry refused and switched to his dad, Bobby Bonds' old number, 25. The movie was ultimately spoiled by huge suspensions in belief. The mutual dislike between Rayburn an Primo mirrored the real-life mutual dislike between MVP's Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. But the pettiness involved here made the players seem like spoiled children. The part where DeNiro's character managed to coax Rayburn's son into the Hummer and drive off was never explained. Why Rayburn never immediately notified the police and an APB called to find such a conspicuous vehicle is incredulous. The fact that DeNiro was able to kill an umpire and switch places with him during the course of a rain-delayed game, was never explained. It just popped up as if in a Bugs Bunny cartoon. The game resumed and Rayburn attempted an inside the park HR during a torrential downpour that rivaled any monsoon in India. No way the game would have resumed in such conditions. Also, the fact that it was pitch dark despite the use of stadium lights was never explained. Great acting and great premise for a great film. Unfortunately, it was wasted by lapses in reality.",4,2,4,8 January 2012
Public Enemies," Public Enema
","This movie was historically inaccurate. In reality, Dillinger's story was much more fantastic and unbelievable. What right does the producer of this film have to change history? One example is the Bohemian Lodge case. Red did not die there. They all escaped. Nelson was killed four months after Dillinger; Pretty Boy Floyd was killed three months after Dillinger. In the film, both were shown to have preceded Dillinger in death.Depp was smug and subdued; sort of a snotty gangster. This role could have been out of his range. He seemed too skinny and punkish. Stephen Graham, who portrayed Baby Face Nelson, actually looked like him and was able to portray the viciousness of the real person. Christian Bale was solid as Purvis. One thing about the directing: It was awful. The movie consisted of one extreme closeup after another. It happened so frequently that one scene where the camera panned up Christian Bale's face so that you looked up his nostrils prompted laughter from the audience. Marion Cotillard has ugly brown stains on the tips of her upper front teeth. I felt like her dentist staring into her extremely close-up mouth. The scene where they had sex was again filmed so close up that I thought the creases on the soles of her feet were her butt cleavage. What will Mann do in his next film? Use a microscope instead of a camera? And don't get me started on the shaky-jumpy camera technique. The camera panned around and quivered constantly; annoying. The final scene at the Biograph neglected to show Dillinger run into an alley. It also left out the fact that several people were injured by bullets and debris in the carnage. Could have been much better. Depp, like DeCapprio, is a grown man with boyish features. He encountered problems portraying Dillinger much like Leonardo Decapprio had trouble portraying Howard Hughes.",2,4,9,3 July 2009
Us," The worst movie since film was invented.
","Jordan Peele is a comedic genius... his skits with Kegan Key of Key & Peele are hilarious.
But how could this talented man conceive of, write, and direct this atrocious, boring, stupid, idiotic waste of film?
He should stick to comedy. This inept horror movie makes Teenagers From Outer Space seem like Star Wars.",1,4,9,3 January 2020
The Girl Next Door," Excrement: It's Not Just for the Toilet Anymore
","Despite the fact that the premise was removed as far from reality as possible, I did get a few laughs during the first half of the film. Just two or three. Not much for 90 minutes. I can watch my dog or cat for 90 minutes and get more laughs. We have to assume that all teenage boys are into porn. We have to assume that a girl who makes a living wiping DNA off her face is very together and desirable. We have to believe that a boy's parents approve of his porn interests. We have to believe that a pornographic sex infomercial tape was bought by every high school in the country to show in health ed. class even though it contains full nudity. We have to believe that this sex tape made a teenage boy $$$ millions. We have to believe that a skinny porn producer kicks butt on four huge high school varsity football players and they run away like sissies.Once again, this movie was complete trash.",1,6,16,27 December 2010
Juno," She Never Expected to be Expecting
","First off, the film was very entertaining and held your interest throughout. Ellen Page was very engaging as Juno and her constant witty banter is what the movie was really all about. Forget everything else; the dialogue was smart and very funny. Not that for one minute I would think any 16 year old would be capable of flawless ,witty commentary and comebacks every time she opened her mouth. She really did seem like Gidget on crank. The yuppie couple played by Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner seemed tragically realistic. I've met many upwardly mobile couples who share their bland , self-centered personalities. Bateman was going through an internal dilemma halfway through a midlife crisis and not accepting the responsibilities of growing up. Garner's character seemed like the over educated, hyper serious type who is probably a real pain to be around after awhile. These two yuppies were doomed to self-destruct their marriage. The abortion clinic scene was real and ultimately uplifting. Juno's parents seemed supportive, yet distant. Her boyfriend was a total cypher; a drip's drip. Yet I could see how a gabby sixteen year old girl could fall madly in love with someone who just happens to be her 'type'. The ending was a disappointment because I feel Garner's character was icy and fragile; not good mom material - and single.",7,1,5,24 June 2008
Spider-Man 3," Dulls the Senses
","I'll focus on just one thing: implausibility. Spiderman is stuck on his rival's web. Sandman, who is the size of a 10-story building, repeatedly batters him with his fist, which is the size of two elephants. Again and again, Spiderman is pummeled by this gigantic fist. Nothing happens. He is unhurt. Although bound face up and taking the full force of the attack on his chest, nothing happens. He gets up when Sandman stops hitting him. Wait a minute!! Hello?? If that doesn't numb your senses, what does? This garbage actually makes kids stupid. Then, there's the evil spiderman who wears a black mask. How come he suddenly has jaws the size of a shark with a hundred gleaming, sharp teeth just because he donned a mask? This, too, will make your kid stupid. Not to mention a flying skateboard that shoots missiles and has a built- in flamethrower. It's just a flat skateboard without wheels!!! This, too, will contribute to making your kid stupid. Incredibly dumb. I saw this on the movie channel and got a headache because it was just ...so...DUMB!!!",1,3,5,6 July 2009
Molly's Game," Too much Sorkin
","The dialogue is far too unrealistic and transforms the actors into robots. You need a PhD in economics to follow the droll, dry gaming drama. Overly long and incredibly boring. Jessica Chastain is gorgeous and looks to be around 4'11'. The Alan Ladd of actresses and who would ever guess she was 40? So the film is all about Chastain's curves, cleavage, and cleft chin.",1,4,8,5 February 2019
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Slice of Life
","This is Tim Burton's crowning achievement. Johnny Depp proved his right to be considered among the greatest actors. Helen Bonham Carter kept pace with him frame for frame. This movie was a triumph on many levels. The setting - Victorian London - was presented in eerie detail. Burton is a genius in collecting subtle details that collectively transport the audience into another world and holds them captive.The blood, the shocking violence, (did I mention the blood?), the perfect casting; the fast-paced thrill ride of a movie which combines deep pathos with dark humor adds up to an unforgettable cinematic experience. A true classic that will forever stand the test of time.",10,1,2,5 October 2008
The Thing," 'Alien' With Frostbite
","Excellent special effects. As in 'Alien', Carpenter shows an eerily realistic spaceship wreckage. As in 'Alien', it's just one long cat-and- mouse game. But it's very well-made, the special effects are scary and very creative, and the atmosphere captures men in isolation, with no help for rescue. (In the Arctic, no one can hear you scream).. There were some flaws, however. As in 'Alien', we have an African American character who has a highly qualified position,no doubt having had to be screened for intelligence,and technical know-how. As in 'Alien', he is a jive turkey; a fool who speaks like an uneducated ghetto stereotype. Some scenes called for an emotional response, but the characters took it in stride. When Russel's character and the other guy look at a huge spaceship stuck in he ice, they seem too relaxed. Nobody said, 'Wow! a flying saucer!' They didn't even elaborate on it when they got back o the other guys. When the horrific Thing kept warping itself into demonic images of horror, nobody really panicked...they just dealt with it as if it were a rat in the kitchen... At the end, the alien inexplicably attained gigantic proportions. And when I sit riveted to the screen for two hours, I want closure....not this type of ending.",8,0,1,14 June 2011
Heartbreak Ridge," Maybe Eastwood's Worst Film
","This film centered around a painfully obnoxious and immature group of soldiers and their hard-nosed sergeant. The soldiers, led by the ever- noxious Mario Van Peebles, were a group of losers that seemed to have escaped from the local Youth Guidance Center. Every time Van Peebles opens up his mouth, it's another negative racial stereotype against black people. He never stops with the lame quips and wisecracks: 'I'm the Ayatollah of Rock n' Rolla'; 'I'm funkadelic', 'Mac's the name, lovin's my game'; 'take that suckas'; 'It's a beautiful day and I'm ready to play'; 'I should be home watching The Flintstones'. Those are just a few of the dozens of lame utterances coming from Van Peeble's mouth. He never shuts up. All were uttered in the heat of battle and you just wanted him to get shot. Then, he fires about 200 rounds in a med. school dorm and a beautiful blonde steps out of the shower and drops her towel. Can we say 'gratuitous nudity'? Then, there's the fight between old man Eastwood and a recruit who is 6'7' and 300 lb. of solid muscle. Eastwood dispatches him as if he were a 5 year old girl. How? He grabbed his arm and the guy cried uncle. Took one second. This marks the first film where Eastwood lost his voice. He barely whispers everything.",Null,2,6,9 September 2011
Rocky IV," Blocks Punches With His Face
","Unbelievably bad movie. The only good 'Rocky' movie was the first one - you know; the one Stallone didn't direct. When he's not showing off his perfect tan and perfect abs, Rocky is hamming it up as..... a rich vain guy. Gone are the personality traits that made him likable. Then there is the music video montage of Rocky and Apollo - get a room, guys! The fight scene with Drago was worse than a Popeye cartoon. You know - Bluto just beats him until he cracks open that can of spinach. Now if you don't believe me, count it yourself - Rocky got punched full force in the face fifty (50) times in the first round!!! That's right - fifty times!!! During the course of the fight, he was punched in the face over 200 times!! That's more than any boxer got tagged in their entire career - they would have been in a coma had this happened to them. End of story - extremely crappy movie.",1,18,39,30 June 2010
Dunkirk," What's all the fuss? Not so good.
","For one thing, it was scaled back too much. In reality, Dunkirk was a huge battle involving the evacuation of around 400 thousand men. Hundreds of planes and ships were lost. Thousands of men died. The movie failed to convey the magnitude at all. We see a few planes dog fighting instead of hundreds. We see a few ships and boats sunk instead of hundreds. We follow one character around throughout the movie and it was boring. I really can't say I liked this movie. Great sound effects though.",4,18,31,28 July 2017
The Fast and the Furious," Pure Fantasy, but it Works
","This is a good movie to watch more than once. The first time I saw it, I didn't know what to expect and it seemed very fast-paced and confusing. The movie is rather bizarre, and I dismissed it as being dumb. The second time I saw it, I began to appreciate it. The cinematography, editing, and clipped acting worked together with the hip soundtrack. The plot seemed implausible, but it was entertaining. Definitely a cut above any 'B' flick, this film was first rate. Paul Walker and Vin Diesel were great in their respective roles. When Diesel went off and kicked someone's butt, he was the epitome of a genuine bad dude. Walker was the ultimate in cool, even though he acted like a teenager, but that's what undercover cops do. So, I have to recommend 'Fast and Furious' - tuner car heaven. And the climactic duel between tuner cars and 18-wheeler was one of the better action sequences ever filmed. Even though climbing onto the hood of a truck going 80 mph is completely ludicrous. How would he get into the cab without being hit with a stick? Doesn't the driver have a cell phone to call 911??",8,3,4,19 December 2010
Duck You Sucker," Unpleasant Peasant
","Okay, I'll give Rod Seiger credit for portraying a Mexican bandito with some conviction. That's it. This celebration of cruel violence, massacres, and interminable firing squads was weird and ultimately stupid. It was sort of a 'buddy' film, where mass murderers Coburn and Steiger carried off a sort of romance by way of flashing their toothy smiles at each other to register approval or admiration. Particularly disturbing was when Steiger, as a stinking, fat, slobby, unwashed, disgusting bandito decides to rape a well-dressed society woman. First, he exposes himself as he approaches her, and we are expected to believe that she was impressed and actually wants to be raped. Yes, this was quite disturbing. Steiger's character also had a young son, about eight years old, who was a natural killer and was not opposed to shooting unarmed people. Thus, when he himself was gunned down, we were supposed to feel pity. I didn't. It was also stupid when Coburn's character opened up his trench coat to reveal sticks of dynamite and vials of nitro glycerin; one drop of which would explode upon hitting the ground, causing a large crater. This was intended to discourage the banditos from shooting him. He handled the nitro so carefully; yet he carried the vials while speeding along on a motorcycle over a bumpy, pothole-infested mountain trail.Also annoying was the out-of-place 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' style score, which kept popping up at inappropriate times, like during a massacre. The vocal, 'Shom-shom-shom' was very weird.James Coburn, as usual, offered little more than horselike teeth, flashed liberally. Rod Steiger was the cute mass murderer. Yuck.",1,17,34,14 September 2008
Quantum of Solace," Z 007 lander
","Okay, Daniel Craig totally ripped off Ben Stiller's 'Zoolander' 'Blue Steel' pose. Yes, his mouth is permanently affixed to this pose, but it works. Craig is a dark, brooding Bond who is edgy and dangerous. You can get killed playing checkers with this guy. The production values of this film put all other James Bond movies to shame (except Casino Royale). The sets are gritty and go places all the other Bond movies could never take you: that is, true, scary realism. The action sequences are scary and breathtaking. The plot moves along very quickly and you have to pay attention or its subtleties will pass you by. The characters are realistic - no 'Jaws' here. Great, action-packed film. James Bond without gadgets? Yeah, just a lot of grit and sweat. The fight scenes are fast-paced, violent, and well-choreographed. It feels like you're witnessing a real fight.This 'Bond' has top-notch production values right up there with Oscar-winning movies. In fact, it should have gotten nominated. Craig carries the film and he's just as cool as McQueen - despite the 'Blue Steel' affliction.",10,4,9,16 December 2008
No Country for Old Men," Stone Cold
","This film was pure genius. The Coen brothers are very talented. Like Fargo, this film was riveting and full of surprises. Unlike Frago, it had little, if any, humor. The cinematography was breathtaking, with scenes of the desert and big sky captivating. The protagonist, Chigurh, was relentless and you kept hoping he'd get his just desserts in a big way. This was a three-way chase film,, and had its shocking moments. Josh Brolin was excellent as the cowboy type and he carried the film in a big way. I don't know if he was nominated for an Oscar, but he should have been. Tommy Lee Jones's character seemed to epitomize the title of the film. An unforgettable classic. Chigurgh has a haunting presence. A scary, brutal, tense drama that reaches out and grabs you. There are times in a film when you wish you could intervene and step into the screen. That means you're captivated. This is one of those films. It grabs yo emotionally. What a ride.",10,4,6,18 July 2008
Mamma Mia!," Who Says Middle Age is Over the Hill?
","Despite its implausible plot, this musical has a life of its own. It's very engrossing in its exotic locale and all the musical numbers are lively and well done. Pierce Brosnan actually sounds like Paul McCartney when he sings. Meryl Streep is a very good singer. Christine Baranski stole the show. The camera loves this woman and she's still very sexy at 55. Julie Walters and Meryl Streep are invisible when they share the screen with her; especially Julie Walters - invisible. Baranski is very graceful and carries the dance scenes. Amanda Seyfried is a beautiful young actress and she was a strong presence in the film - very lively and vivacious. I would recommend this film - it is very upbeat and entertaining.",8,1,2,11 July 2009
Saving Private Ryan," riveting
","Compared to other WWII movies I've seen, this one stands out. The opening battle of Omaha Beach was intense. It made me feel like I'd been there. The closing battle was also frighteningly realistic. The scene where the platoon's respite is interrupted by the rumbling of tanks was white-knuckle scary. It wasn't entirely free from clichés. The scene where Ryan's mother is told about the news of her sons' deaths was sad, but....a farm in the heartland? It would have been more powerful if she lived on a city block in New York or San Francisco. I didn't like the scene where Matt Damon's character is clutching his ankles and rocking while crying in the midst of battle. I don't think many GI's would do that. It was also far-fetched and inexplicable why the Nazi soldier would descend a staircase and pass a cowering GI with nine yards of machine gun bullets draped over his shoulder without killing him in he midst of a desperate battle. Still, the movie was a triumph.",8,1,6,3 August 2007
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Very Imaginative, engrossing film.
","Very subtle plot references, very sensitive characterizations...this film was very intelligent and kept your interest throughout. The idea that apes could be transformed via the side effects of an experimental drug and could pass this on genetically was very interesting. Then, the reference to the lost astronauts of the original film and the impending extinction of the human race was very subtle..and thus very powerful. The battle of the Golden Gate Bridge was thrilling and full of unforgettable images....John Lithgow gave a very sensitive performance as an Alzheimer victim. John Franco was very believable in his role. The fact that the main villain--an evil, greedy administrator; was a black man, went against Hollywood politically correct stereotypes, which was refreshing.",10,3,5,2 February 2013
2012," Mindless Insult to Anyone with an IQ over 90.
","Lets's just look at the end of the movie. Thousands of people are being jammed into an ark. The ark is a huge floating structure that is impossible for humans to build because of its massive girth. It is the size of 1,000 battleships. The gates are jammed and our hero manages to close them so the engines can start...one second before disaster. Consider this...these thousands upon thousands of people aboard the ark are stuck there for over a month until land is found. What do they eat? Drink? Are there any restrooms? How did the guy who got his leg cut off survive massive infections? Where is the operating room? Naturally, the only PC place for them to land at is Africa, where Darwinists believe mankind originated anyway. Yet everything is dead. It was covered for weeks under water. All plant life and animal life is washed away. Everybody would starve before the first seed developed into a vegetable. Before they land, we see people using computers aboard the ark. Apparently, the internet survived.",Null,1,3,28 August 2011
Good Will Hunting," Ill Will
","This film is definitely overrated. It wasn't badly directed or edited, and held your interest. But when you think back on it, uh-uh. Some parts that didn't go over well: Matt Damon, in an earlier scene, beats another tough guy to a pulp during a brawl on the basketball court. Later on, he gets manhandled by the out-of-shape Robin Williams and looks scared to death as the older guy has a grip on his throat. It was also unintentionally funny, right before this incident, when Robin Williams tells him he can bench press 280 lbs. In your dreams, pal - you are a small, hunched over, out-of-shape middle-aged dude. Also, Williams' character was ready to kill Will because he disrespected the memory of his deceased wife. A short time later, he laughs as he describes how his late wife loudly farted all the time, even in her sleep. How endearing.Then there's the scene where Matt tells off a stuck-up guy in the bar by giving him a history lesson from 1770. Like, anyone in a bar cares. Then, he gets Minnie Driver's phone number and it's a big trophy; an accomplishment. You would need very thick beer goggles to ask for her number. Then, there's the math whiz stuff where he connects the dots on triangles and it's like he he invents the theory of relativity. Also, Damon is a genius about everything......was he from Krypton??",4,3,7,25 June 2011
The Hurt Locker," Not so great.
","The Hurt Locker won Best Picture, so expectations were high. It was a disappointment. Why Renner was nominated for Best Actor, I'll never know. His performance was bland; typical of a CSI episode on TV. Steven Seagal could act circles around him. The film had its suspenseful moments, like will he get blown up or not? They milked this to the hilt. It should have been nominated for Queasiest Motion Picture. The plot was boring - just defusing bombs and dealing with snipers. The part where they faced a sniper in the desert was dumb. They spent the entire day looking at a stone fortification half a mile away. In reality, the soldiers would have simply called for an air strike and be done with it. The scene where Renner takes off and carjacks an Iraqi civilian to do justice on the streets of Baghdad at night was dumb, as was his decision to take his crew with him to look for the person who laid out an IED in narrow alleys in complete darkness. Renner's recklessness would never have been tolerated because by flagrantly violating rules, he put his life in jeopardy as well as others. In the end, the characters were cardboard cut outs and didn't seem real.",Null,4,5,18 July 2011
The Longest Day," Ambitious film has its moments but gets bogged down in creamed corn.
","I knew this film was in trouble when near the beginning French model Irina Demick, playing a member of the French underground, rides a bike in a 1962 hairdo and makeup. If you were going for authenticity, don't let an actress appear with such an obvious joke of a hairdo. The rest of the movie is submerged in corny dialogue and wholesome soldiers who have the personalities of 8-year old cub scouts (Richard Beymer, Red Buttons) or of cranky lint bags (John Wayne, Peter Lawford, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum). The combat action depicted here is very weak - the horrors of Omaha Beach are not conveyed to any degree that would do justice to what had actually occurred there. None of the chaos and stark terror that is war is shown in this film - only down scaled, obviously choreographed, watered down nonsense. The beginning of he film showed promise, with the drum roll beating as the action shifts from the German fortifications - the marching soldiers, the German officer playing fetch with a German shepherd on the beach.....then we see Irina with her bubble-flip hairdo....and it's all downhill from there.",3,7,14,30 December 2011
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," The Boring Ordeal of Benjamin Gump
","This film was an overly long, excruciatingly boring heap of pretentious trash. The cinematography and direction was great. Everything else was pathetic, boring, or unintentionally funny.Brad Pitt has made a lucrative career on his good looks. He can't, however, act his way out of a paper bag. He displays three ranges of emotions : mouth closed, mouth one quarter open, and mouth half open. His character, like Forest Gump, was a Southern dimwit; except it was devoid of humor. The plain looking English woman who had an affair with him in Russia must have been extremely desperate to hit on a sixty-something wrinkled old bespectacled man who had the personality of a traumatized hamster. What - she ran out of batteries? Cate Blanchett looked horrendous. Did you ever see the transvestite in 'Beyond the Valley of the Dolls'? Dead ringer. Her makeup had to have been applied with a trowel by System Pavers, the company that paved my driveway last summer. She looks like that weird puppet in those 'Saw' flicks. Such an unattractive woman in a leading role ruined the film. Pitt seemed to be getting cuter while she kept getting uglier. The movie became bogged down in this dull love affair. How could this woman ever generate passion from a Tibetan monk strung out on Viagra, let alone Brad Pitt, was beyond me. It was unintentionally funny when Pitt met his teenage daughter. The poor girl inherited her mother's looks. That bit in Paris where they had an extended 'what if' sequence of events prior to the pedestrian/car accident was ludicrous. The silly twit forgot to look while crossing - so what?Faune A. Chambers, who played Pitt's adoptive mom characterized the most blatant, obnoxious stereotypical black person ever seen on film since the 1930's. I felt like standing up and shouting, 'Okay, we get it - she's black!' Why the NAACP didn't boycott her performance, I'll never know. She made Stepin' Fetchitt seem like James Earl Jones.This film was Forest Gump meets Boring Chick Flick. The ending caught me by surprise. I thought he was going to regress into a sperm.",1,42,79,26 January 2009
Lincoln," Wasted Effort...Quite Boring
","Oh,what could have been. Steven Spielberg is a great director,but he got bogged down in showing a two and a half hour movie about the passage of the 13th Amendment. It was like watching C Span. The dialogue was pretentious and staged throughout. The endless haggling and vote-seeking put me to sleep more than once, but I diligently pressed the rewind button. Spielberg's genius showed briefly at the beginning of the film when fierce hand-to-hand Civil War fighting was vividly depicted as opposing forces tangled in a shallow creek.I had never before seen such a realistic battle sequence. His brief depiction of Lee's surrender at Appomatox was also memorable. The horror of the all-to-common practice of amputation was shockingly delivered. Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln was uncanny...I had read from a primary source that Lincoln's voice was indeed high-pitched. Other than that, this movie, which should have been titled, 'The 13th Amendment' was an unrelenting,sleep inducing bore. What a waste of time and money.They should have made a film about Lincoln's White House years, including the death of his son, his hands- on military decisions and the firing of Gen. McClellan,the Emancipation Proclamation, the Gettysburg Address, the passage of he 13th Amendment, and Lincoln's assassination. Instead, the focus was only on the 13th Amendment....utter boredom.",2,1,5,23 November 2013
Clash of the Titans," CGI Bore
","This film was nothing more than a glorified video game. I don't know about you, but my brain disengages when all that Computer Generated Imagery is used. This film relied on it. Also, the 3-D effects were pitiful. Liam Neeson's face seemed to project outward from his head. Persius was updated so he can be 'cool' circa 2011. In a world full of guys with long hair and beards, our hero walked around in a buzz-cut and a gangsta attitude.. Why not just throw in the saggy pants and tattoos while you're at it? The dialogue was extremely bad. Everything was some kind of reverent, lofty quote; as if everyone was a Shakespeare. The giant scorpions and flying harpies were CGI nightmares....more fake than the old stop-action creatures. Medussa was just a CGI joke - shrouded in shadowy, jerky-action. The Cracken was scary looking and huge, but ultimately not that menacing. It seemed like a monster with a disability of some kind. All the action sequences were of the confusing CGI fast- paced, nonsensical variety - people rubbing up on each other, falling 60 feet, getting up like nothing happened, etc. And the whole thing was filmed in a kind of amber hue that sucked out any color. Don't see this mess if you can help it.",1,6,8,15 August 2011
The Hangover Part II," How Dumb Can It Get?
","First off, the acting was very good. Slick production, well-paced, good plot. With all that going for it, they managed to screw it up. The end result was an implausible,insulting, piece of garbage. It all started off well enough, then things unraveled. There wasn't a good enough reason for the intoxicated debauchery....muscle relaxer-laced marshmallows??? Then, two things spoiled everything: the rape encounter with the transsexual prostitute, complete with photos, and the slicing off of the fingers of a 16- year-old med student prodigy. This was inexplicable and sick. Are we to assume that any of this is funny? Like I said, they didn't need to go there. The acting was good, the monkey was funny,....even Mike Tyson was funny. Just don't think you can cross the line and still come out unscathed.",1,4,7,6 April 2013
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Wilted Wizzard
","No, I'm not a big Harry Potter fan. I've dutifully taken my wife to all of these boring,dimwitted movies over the years. In my opinion, each one was a waste of film. The stories, centered around 'Hogwash', are tedious, wretched, and self-absorbed. I'll never know how the books sold so well. My wife has read all of them. They're probably as ridiculous as the movies. This one in particular was awful. Hermione and Ron had no lines except to react to whatever Harry says. The dialogue is atrocious. My wife kept pinching me because I snore when I sleep and she was afraid the usher would ask us to leave. And what's up with the retarded giant who's tied to a tree? Yes, the gameskeeper has a retarded giant for a brother and although he's an adult, he wears a diaper and is tied to a tree. The special effects weren't that great. Centuars and other creatures bounce around so quickly, it's hard to appreciate their appearance (or or lack of). It was a crashing bore interspersed with zapping fireballs. Zapping fireballs get old and so does this mess of a series.",2,0,3,19 July 2007
Once Upon a Time in America," More garbage From Sergio Leone
","Sergio Leone's films are all miserably, awkward attempts by a sick, childlike individual. This film is no exception. Unlike true classics like The Godfather I and II, Goodfellas, and Scarface; Once Upon a Time in America is incredibly inept. Like the director (what's his name?) who was responsible for The Deer Hunter and Heaven's Gate, Leone is terribly inept, and it shows. Scenes such as the woman who begs to be raped, the switching of babies in the maternity ward, and the pulling out of penises so a woman can identify the rapist are sick. The scene where the extremely fat prostitute kisses Noodles is sick. The scene where Noodle deliberately drives off a pier is inexplicably stupid. The scene where they shoot up a car when the mobsters inside are obviously already dead is very strange. Stupid and sick. That sums up Sergio Leone. Implausible garbage.",2,10,32,1 November 2009
The Godfather: Part III," Oddfather
","Okay, this could have been great except for the plot, the cast, etc. Godfather I and II were classics on anyone's list. This one stank. Andy Garcia was capable as Sonny's tough guy son. But what is this incest stuff? In one scene, he's in bed with an incredibly hot chick. Then, we see him go ga-ga for his first cousin, Mary Corleone, played by Sofia Coppola. Gee, I wonder how she got the role. How can any man look at her twice? I'm sorry, but she has features that would render Viagra useless, even if you swallowed the whole bottle. I'm straight, but I'd rather make out with Al Pacino. And she's his first cousin??!! Andy Garcia is that hard up? I've heard of taking your cousin to the prom, but ----NOOO!!! Now, if my cousin was Charlese Therone, I just might go for it and get my birth certificate changed...but Sofia Coppola??? The Pope thing was a little weird. So was the big Knights of Malta Cross on Michael Corleone's cake. And once again -Andy- if you're gonna go the incest route, hit on your Aunt, played by Talia Shire. She may be older, but she's much hotter. Close knit Italian families don't tolerate incest anyway, except maybe the West Virginia Corleones.",1,13,22,26 December 2007
The Wrestler," Half Nelson
","This film strived for gritty realism but failed. The dialogue, acting,and superficiality of this film made it ultimately fake. The film was mainly a gross-out; bloodletting through razor blades, staple guns, deli slicers. The relationships between Ram and the stripper or his daughter were cliché and predictable. What the heck ever happened to Mickey Rourke? I know that he tried his hand at boxing in the early 90's. He apparently lost quite a few matches because his face seems unrecognizable from the leading man in the 80's. He looks like Ward Bond on steroids. He obviously took a lot of steroids to become transformed from a skinny young man to a muscle-packed middle ager in his mid fifties. In real life, he's a strange, drugged out person, so his acting in this film wasn't much of a stretch and should not have been considered for the Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Marissa Tomei took the opportunity here to show off her finely toned body - very nice for a woman past forty. She did, however, use a much younger stunt double in the scenes where she wiggled her naked bottom on the stage. The film could have been much more powerful and effective, but it dripped with forced sentiment. In the hands of a more capable director,along with a better screenplay, it could have been a contender. Creepy trivia: Rourke is having an off screen affair with the actress who played his daughter. She's 30 years younger than him. Another thing that creeped me out: Why does 'Ram' pin up his long hair like a woman instead of wearing a ponytail? Sick.",5,0,3,1 January 2010
Hancock," Half Cocked
","This movie could have been a great comedy. It was a great comedy until it took a moribund twist during the last half hour. The film had a novel concept: a derelict superhero. Will Smith and the rest of the cast did a great job. Great special effects, funny situations. There could have been more jokes regarding Smith's attitude and scumbag ways. The film was moving merrily along until they injected the concept of Charleze's character as a duplicate superhero. The fight she had with Smith, where tornadoes and electrical storms topped off a battle where trucks were swung around was really over the top and from there on in, the film went downhill. The last part of the film was pure pathos and suddenly there's no more comedy. Terrible mistake - another film that tried to do too much and ultimately was ruined.",4,1,3,8 July 2009
The Blind Side," A Feel-Good Movie, but it's a True Story
","This film had its moments. The actor who portrayed Big Mike did a great subtle job of portraying a young man who was in the process of being rescued from a nightmare life. Sandra Bullock portrayed a real-life person who just happened to be bigger than life. I don't think the movie was all that realistic and I don't think all the issues were explored in depth.It was definitely sugar coated and could have benefited from some realistic dialogue and better screen writing. I don't think Sandra Bullock deserved Best Actress. She didn't seem to add any depth or emotion to her character. SJ was played by a cute kid, but he needed to act more like a kid. The daughter and the husband were complete cyphers; walking scenery.The scene where Michael is tormented by gang members while sitting in their apartment in the projects was played out very well. It was very realistic when Michael snapped. Very good acting. All in all, I would recommend this movie. Good entertainment. The true story is quite remarkable and the tragedy turns former high school athletes into dead thugs was also addressed.",7,1,3,18 June 2011
Ben-Hur," The Greatest Film Ever
","This spectacle stands alone. It has never been matched before or since its release. It emerged amid the corny, cheesy, overacted, holier than thou biblical epics of the fifties and doesn't resemble any of them. Its characters were contemporary; none of that vacant 'holy' look that permeated the genre. Charlton Heston was never better; his propensity for overacting reigned in. Stephen Boyd was the epitome of the hateful villain in his role as Mesalla. His seething hatred and lack of personal character was conveyed perfectly.The chariot race was the greatest cinematic achievement in history. It was flawless, from the cavernous arena where the race took place to the breathtaking spectacle of teams of four horses running flat out without a hint of background music. It was pure realism - white knuckle, riveting, terrifying realism. What an achievement in direction and editing to give the impression of a seamless sequence of jaw dropping action. The crashes, the brutality, the beauty of the horses; nothing compares.The sea battle was better than anything attempted in the realm of pitched battle at sea. The galley slaves, chained to their positions as their ship is rammed, was unforgettable.This beautiful cinematic masterpiece was perfectly cast,had a triumphant, inspiring score, had pageantry that captured the glory of Rome, and ultimately inspired Christians with its reverent portrayal of Christ from birth until crucifixion. Yet, it wouldn't have worked without Charlton Heston - perfectly cast and displaying a command of acting rarely seen on the screen - subtle, powerful, explosive; unbelievable. Ben Hur - in a class by itself.",10,9,17,15 September 2008
Casino Royale," James Bourne
","The formula for Bond movies has been abandoned. James Bond is now just another action hero who can run, jump, and beat up people. Gone is the sophisticated charm and womanizing of the old Bond. Gone is the confident, arrogant swagger you liked so much. It seems Daniel Craig is just another Timothy Dalton, only athletic. Dalton lacked the sophistication and confidence of Bond. Connery had it.Lazenby had it. Moore had it, and Brosnan had it. Craig and Dalton were both poor choices to play Bond. This movie is not the worst Bond film. Never Say Never Again holds that distinction. Dalton's two films were not so great, but he didn't write them. A few of Moore's films were real stinkers. At least this one tried for more realism. The torture scene was straight out of the 1953 novel by Ian Flemming. But there were no gadgets, except for a heart defibulator - and what that was doing in an Aston Martin, I'll never know. Could you imagine Q giving Sean Connery a heart defibulator?? Craig plays Bond with no personality - too businesslike; no fun. Too blah. And that Zoolander look...",5,2,6,26 July 2010
Godzilla," Excellent film....very well made.
","The 3D was very good. It was 'on' throughout the film. Very interesting story line...okay..probably a lot of plot holes, but taking it for what it is, solid entertainment. The havoc depicted in Honolulu, Las Vegas, and San Francisco was breathtaking. The pace was very good...the mysterious crisis, the historical revelations, and the horrible ineffectiveness of modern technology to combat these mega monsters was convincingly depicted.The movie's strength lies in its imaginative direction...lots of surprises.This is set apart from other Godzilla movies because it took itself very seriously..no cute asides, nothing played for laughs...just terror...from a tsunami to a wobbling suspension bridge.",10,12,27,16 May 2014
Casino," Gambled and Lost
","This film was ruined by the technique of narration. The same technique that spoiled Goodfellas completely wrecked Casino. DeNiro and Peschi's characters narrated it for us as if it was a slide show. How great this film would have been if it was done in a straightforward manner. Instead, we even have narration as gangsters are shooting each other. Sharon Stone stole he show and she deserved to get the Oscar for Best Actress. Too bad she didn't. I don't know what more an actress could do. The film was full of great moments - Peschi for all intents and purposes reprized his role as Tommy from Goodfellas and was as menacing as ever, though it mystifies me as how anyone could be intimidated by this dwarf. It's almost as bad as when Danny DeVito played the tough guy in 'Hoffa'.But look out - when Peschi goes after a guy with a ballpoint pen, all bets are off - I mean, we're not in Kansas anymore...harrowing. DeNiro was bland, as he was in Goodfellas - he didn't seem to try to act. Once again, this film was absolutely ruined by the intrusive narration. It muddled the continuity and restricted the storyline.",5,1,3,30 January 2011
300," Ancient Spearchuckers With Killer Abs
","First of all, was this a cartoon or what? It's way too stylized, like illustrations in a science fiction magazine. They should have played it straight, like in 'Braveheart', for example. The dialogue was unintentionally funny. Everyone tried to one-up each other in the 'profound statement' department. The part where the future king fought the wolf in the bitter snowstorm was laughable - he was wearing only a diaper and didn't succumb to hypothermia. Why was Xerxes portrayed as an eight foot tall gay dude? Maybe a 5'5' gay dude would have been more plausible. And why did he travel on top of a float? And the palace - I didn't know they had 'palaces to go ' back then. Those Spartans had to have been a pretty vain bunch what with the perfect abs. What - you couldn't be a Spartan without perfect abs? And what about those Persians? They had all the fighting skills of zombies (see 'Night of the Living Dead'). Save your money.",1,6,10,10 January 2008
Fast Five," Lacks the Credibility of a Road Runner-Coyote Cartoon
","Okay, you chase down a speeding train in a rickety tractor rig, bumping along on desert terrain. You pull up to the speeding train, matching its exact speed, as you deftly cut the entire side of the box car with a blow torch. You hop in and deftly park a Ford GT onto the tractor rig not once, but twice. Then you drive a Corvette Stingray off the speeding train; the car crashing 15 feet onto the bumpy desert terrain off a speeding train and it causes no more damage than a small pothole. You speed the Corvette down bumpy desert terrain and are headed straight for the steel girder of a bridge spanning a 500 ft. deep gorge as a guy jumps off a train onto the car at the last split second.The girder apparently moved out of the way. You jump from the car as it hurtles downward off the cliff towards the water; a much longer plunge than from the Golden Gate Bridge and you pop up from the water, unscathed, as if you had just dove into a pool. You're then strung up suspended by chains in a warehouse but simply snap out of the chains just before the bad guys torture you and escape....All this happens after a speeding prison bus collides with a black Accura sports car..and the car wins! The car is undamaged as the bus rolls a dozen times and lands upside down with none of the handcuffed prisoners having been killed...and did the Rock take acting lessons from OJ?...This film is unconscionable garbage and is not worth watching.",1,9,17,14 February 2012
The Thin Red Line," An Insult to American Heroes
","Clooney? Penn? Nolte? Harrelson? Cusak? With these leftist activist America-haters in the mix, the outcome is predictable. Americans are portrayed as inept and incompetent. In reality, their bravery in the Pacific Theater in WWII was unbelievable. They fought bravely and died by the tens of thousands in places like Guadacanal, Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and Tarawa. Upon viewing this film, one would think the Japanese soldiers were the good guys; superior to Americans. In reality, the Japanese rivaled the Nazis in their killing and raping of civilians, torture of prisoners, and unspeakable atrocities.All this film needed were more America-hating actors in the cast, with Jane Fonda portraying General MacArthur.",1,2,12,24 December 2008
The Great Escape," Hogan Never Had It So Good
","This film had a stellar cast, and most of them delivered. The score was unusually cheerful and eerie, too. A strange combination. In reality, allied POW's in German detention camps were treated with contempt and without mercy. What we have in this film, however, are a bunch of guys who act like they belong in a country club. The country club/summer camp they reside in is a fun place, except you'll get shot if they catch you climbing the fence. That's it - no mention of the terrible brutality these guys actually endured or the fact that they were given barely enough food to live on. No mention of the atrocities regularly visited upon them by their Nazi captors, including beatings, executions, and forced marches. Instead, we get gentlemanly or comical Germans who seem to actually care what the POW's think of them.James Garner's character seems to epitomize the relaxed country club type who seems to be on vacation. He never takes off his turtleneck, which, no doubt, would cause the average person to perspire and stink after awhile. Steve McQueen, as usual, was the coolest guy in the room, but why would the Nazis allow him to have a baseball and glove to keep himself amused while in solitary confinement? Why didn't they just shoot him or beat the hell out of him after he was captured? Instead, they treated him like a naughty school boy. Richard Attenborough turned in a fine performance, but in reality, the Nazis would have never allowed him to take such a leadership role among the other prisoners. They would have singled him out and broken him instead of giving him respect.The film had many powerful moments: the motorcycle chase, the fatal error on the bus, the massacre, the shooting of the fence climber....these were all extremely well done. The film ultimately failed, though, because it did a disservice to the men who actually lived through this by failing to convey the wretched conditions of a German POW camp.The film had many moments where you had to suspend reality for such banal situations. Why in the world would the Nazis have ever allowed the Americans to hold a 4th of July celebration that include a parade, a picnic, and free-flowing vodka? Why would they allow a still on the premises to make homemade vodka from potatoes? Where did the Americans find a large American flag and why were they allowed to run it up a flagpole? Where did they find the smaller 13-star flag to wave around? Wasn't it out of character for Hilts to suddenly become a master flutist, blowing out a flawless rendition of 'Yankee Doodle'? Colonel Klink would never have allowed Hogan and the boys such privileges! I'm surprised the Nazi guards didn't bake them cookies! What about when Hilts took out the planks from the bunkbeds (all of them) to use to reinforce the tunnel? The beds were now unusable, but the Germans didn't seem to notice all the guys sleeping on the floor, I guess. I could go on and on about these lapses in reality and this is why I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone over the age of 11. Add to this the 1960's film making habit of over illuminating all indoor scenes to the point where it seems like the actors need to wear sunglasses, and you have a very poor rendering of a POW camp. Was I the only one who noticed that the interactions and dialogue of these impeccably dressed and well-groomed men seemed like the goings-on in an upscale gay social club?",5,14,24,18 September 2008
Gladiator," Sadiator
","The acting was excellent. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar he won. Joaquin Phoenix was very good as the incompetent Commodus. The rest of the cast was excellent as well. The movie was lacking in direction, sets, and continuity. There were some very interesting and original aspects to the film: Crowe's character was not one-dimensional. Neither was Phoenix's character. However, the direction was terrible and there were some implausible action sequences. In the Coliseum, we see a chariot attack upon huddled gladiators. The action seems confused, and rightly so. Play it out in slow-mo and you'll see gaps where people disappear and reappear. This jumbled computer generated mess looks pale in comparison to the live action scenes shot in the 60's. The part where Maximus throws his sword 100 feet to kill a guy was ludicrous; like a cartoon. The shots of the Coliseum were lacking. It was as if Scott couldn't afford to hire extras to be in the crowd. The sets seemed shabby and dark. The sequence at the beginning where the Romans fight the Barbarians was very well done and memorable. Too bad this quality could not last throughout the film. The ending was not satisfying enough. Maximus should have rammed the sword down Commodus' throat. I'll close with repeating that the computer generated action sequences were poorly done. The action was too fast for the eye to see and, if viewed in freeze frame, very deceptive and phony.",7,1,2,30 April 2008
Goodfellas," Good-not great, fellas.
","Let me start off by saying that the movie was terribly downgraded by the use of narrative throughout. Scorcese did the narrative technique five years later with Casino and it ruined the film. Imagine hat a mess The Godfather or Scarface would have been with wall-to-wall narrative. So unnecessary and it takes away the feel of the movie. It's actually a crutch.That said, Liotta turned in a Best Actor Oscar worthy performance.I don't think he was even nominated. Peschi deserved his Oscar for Best Suppoting actor. Both guys were intense and turned in flawless performances. DeNiro, oddly enough, turned in a sub par performance. His character was very understated and showed noting of the deranged killer he was to have portrayed. Lots of great scenes and period pieces. The rock n' roll soundtrack worked well. Lots of tunes from the Rolling Stones' 1972 album, 'Exile on Main Street', as well as other Stones songs. But oh, what could have been. Take away the narrative and allow the characters to develop within the context of the film and it's a classic.",7,1,3,25 June 2012
Valkyrie," Putting a Hit on Hitler
","This movie was nothing short of excellent. A reverent look at the brave Claus von Stauffenberg and his ill-fated attempt at assassinating Hitler and overthrowing the Nazi regime. The film was very engrossing and kept your attention throughout.The direction/cinematography was flawless. The action scenes at the beginning depicting the Afrika Korps under attack was the finest battle sequence I have ever seen. The sequences where airplanes from the period were flying and landing added to the realism of the film.Tom Cruise's performance was legendary. He skillfully portrayed the aristocratic von Stauffenberg and had you pulling for him all the way.The film was laden with suspense and even though you knew the outcome going in, there were many minor situations where you were forced to sweat it out.The film was unforgettable and inspirational. I would certainly recommend it to any history buff or anyone interested in a riveting suspense yarn.",10,7,11,13 January 2009
Atonement," Mind Your Manners in the Manor
","An excellent film. Spectacular cinematography. . Excellent cast, great acting; really takes you on a journey and gets you involved in the film. The story unfolds with the unexpected use of flashbacks. It works very well. Suspenseful, nerve-wracking tension. The scenes of Dunkirk may or may not have been historically accurate, but it conveyed a realism that few attempts at recreating scenes from WWII could match. The film is subtle and has just the right touch to make you work at it and keep you involved - nothing heavy-handed here, as is the case with many other period pieces. My only criticism would be that Ms. Knightley, while a fine actress, needs to eat something. A few more pounds would do her good. She's starting to resemble an exhumed corpse.",10,4,6,29 April 2008
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," A Drag of a Race
","Will Ferrell is a funny guy. He was hilarious on SNL. This movie was not funny. It was aimed at a low-brow audience; the kind that might have trouble tying their shoes. What was wrong with it? For one thing, his two young sons were portrayed as hateful brats, which is not too funny. The way they and the rest cruelly laid into the 85 year old grandpa was pathos; not comedy. The prolonged 'grace' scene before the meal where everyone gets a chance to poke fun at Jesus was irreverent and made me cringe. 'Uncomfortable' does not equal 'funny'. When will Will Ferrell finally shelve his signature 'running around naked while flailing your arms ' routine? The boob jokes about his so-called 'smokin' hot wife' were tiresome to all but the toothless truck stop crowd. Sasha Baron Cohen was funny as usual, but was wasted in this overly long stinker.",1,8,16,7 April 2007
